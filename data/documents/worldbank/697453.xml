1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. COUNTRY/SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Agricultural development in Indonesia has been impressive during the past two&#13;
decades. Agricultural growth averaged about 3.8 percent annually, but fell to an annual rate&#13;
of about 2.9 percent over the past five years. Self-sufficiency was achieved in rice&#13;
production and there has been significant reduction in poverty, although many farmers&#13;
remain close to the poverty line. Agriculture contributes about 18 percent of the overall&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP), employs some 50 percent of the labor force, and accounts&#13;
for 26 percent of non-oil exports in foreign exchange earnings. Economic growth is&#13;
expected to generate a more diversified pattern of food demand, with consumption of&#13;
traditional staples declining and demand for income-elastic foods, such as meat and other&#13;
preferred foods, increasing.  Shifting world markets for export commodities add a&#13;
dimension of uncertainty to the direction of future agricultural growth.&#13;
1.2   The government's present five-year development plan (Repelita VI) envisages&#13;
3.4 percent per annum agricultural GDP growth, which represents an increase of&#13;
0.5 percent compared to the previous plan (Repelita V). It will not be easy to achieve this&#13;
target, since easily-attained gains in production, through expansion of irrigation and&#13;
introduction of fertilizer and high-yielding varieties, particularly in rice, have already been&#13;
made. To meet this challenge, a flexible and dynamic agricultural sector will be needed.&#13;
Repelita VI emphasizes subsectors other than rice, agro-industry and agro-business as a&#13;
means of achieving product diversification, strengthening linkages to the industrial sector,&#13;
increasing value added, and providing wider employment opportunities. This will need&#13;
continued strong investment in agriculture, coming primarily from increased involvement of&#13;
the private sector, with the Government of Indonesia (GOI) performing a policy and&#13;
regulatory role and providing public support services. In line with this, a decline is&#13;
envisaged in the share of agriculture in public development spending.&#13;
1.3   The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will increasingly focus on fostering private&#13;
sector development and providing public services such as research, extension, and ural&#13;
infrastructure. This will require improving its institutional capacity to ensure that public-&#13;
service functions are client responsive and performed efficiently by the various public&#13;
agencies, including the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD). In&#13;
addition, GOI and AARD need to identify areas where the private sector can take on&#13;
increasing responsibilities for research and development (R&amp;D).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. GOVERNMENT AGRICULTURE SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.4   With the start of Repelita VI and the Second Long Term Development Plan (PJP II)&#13;
in 1994, the Government's agricultural objectives have shifted from production targets to&#13;
increasing farmers' productivity, incomes, and welfare. As indicated in para. 1.2, the new&#13;
strategy focuses on the development of commercial farming, agribusiness, and agro-&#13;
industries in rural areas, with greater private sector involvement, as a means of increasing&#13;
farmers' incomes, rural employment opportunities, and augmenting value-added within the&#13;
region.&#13;
1.5   Along with the major goal of poverty reduction, increased emphasis will be&#13;
accorded to regional development, in particular to the development of the Eastern Islands.&#13;
This will be supported both through development expenditures carried out by the Central&#13;
Government and through transfers to regional governments to help finance development&#13;
programs for which the implementation responsibility rests with local governments.&#13;
Continued decentralization of development planning, finance, and implementation&#13;
arrangements will be an important policy thrust supporting regional development.&#13;
1.6   Consistent with the increasing role of private investment, Repelita VI projects a&#13;
continuing decline in the share of public investment allocated to directly productive&#13;
agricultural activities, leaving them increasingly to the private sector. However, despite the&#13;
projected decline in government development spending, well-focused public expenditure&#13;
remains important in agriculture, a sector that still provides livelihood to the majority of&#13;
Indonesians and will continue to play a key role in income generation and poverty&#13;
reduction. The focus of the Government's investment in agriculture sector will therefore,&#13;
continue to shift from direct involvement in production to provision of well-designed&#13;
support services, such as extension and research. R&amp;D will emphasize support for regional&#13;
activities, especially in lesser developed parts of the country. Emphasis will be on efficient&#13;
use of resources, income generation, poverty alleviation, and diversification of production.&#13;
In research, as in other services, the efficiency of planned investment will be crucial to the&#13;
attainment of Repelita VI's development targets.&#13;
C. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN INDONESIu&#13;
1.7   Following independence, the thrust of agricultural research in Indonesia shifted from&#13;
export crops to food crops-primarily to the staple food crop, rice, to better meet the&#13;
nutritional needs of the population. GOI's first five-year development plan (Repelita L&#13;
1969-1974) emphasized rice production and mandated research responsibilities to the MOA&#13;
to be implemented in its Directorates-General of Food Crops, Estate Crops, Forestry,&#13;
Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and other agencies. A comprehensive review conducted&#13;
during this period yielded the recommendation that a national agricultural research system&#13;
be established.  The Guidelines for State Policy (GBHN) of 1973 encouraged the&#13;
applcation of science and technology to the solution of national development constraints&#13;
and a Presidential Decree in 1974 authorized the establishment of research and development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
agencies in the several departments and ministries of government. This decree created the&#13;
Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD).&#13;
1.8   To adapt to the changing demands of the Sector, AARD is now undergoing its&#13;
fourth major reorganization (1994 Ministerial Decree, see para. 1.15) since its establishment&#13;
in 1974. Prior to this, AARD went through three reorganizations (1979, 1983, and 1990).&#13;
The Presidential Decree of 1990 established a revised organizational structure consisting of&#13;
a Secretariat, two centers, two research centers, five research and development centers, and&#13;
special association with the Indonesian Planters Association for Research and Development&#13;
(IPARD) and the Indonesian Sugar Research Institute (ISRI). In accordance with Ministry&#13;
mandates, AARD centers continued to manage the activities of 16 research institutes&#13;
located throughout the country and to play a coordinating role with another 10 institutes&#13;
conducting research on estate crops under the auspices of the IPARD and ISRI.&#13;
1.9   A subsequent decree by the Minister of Agriculture in 1990 specified the details of&#13;
AARD's revised mandate and the broad terms for its implementation, whereby AARD was&#13;
designated to coordinate, manage, and conduct agricultural research and development in&#13;
accordance with the policies of the Ministry and national development programs. The&#13;
Ministerial Decree also established an additional center at AARD, the Center for&#13;
Agricultural Machinery Development. In carrying out its various tasks and functions,&#13;
AARD is supported by about 40 research establishments, 64 laboratories, 57 substations,&#13;
and 150 experimental ponds and farms, and has a staff of over 2,400 scientists, of which&#13;
more than 650 have MSc and 240 have PhD degrees.&#13;
1.10  Budgetary support for agricultural research in Indonesia fluctuated in the 1980s and&#13;
early 1990s. Although research spending has increased since 1989, agricultural research&#13;
expenditures, as percentage share of agricultural GDP, was 0.28 in 1992, as against 0.38&#13;
percent for South East Asia. Indonesia still lags behind other countries in agricultural R&amp;D&#13;
expenditures (0.21 percent of AgGDP in 1990), such as Japan (with 2.67 percent), Republic&#13;
of Korea (0.93 percent), India (0.51 percent), Pakistan (0.49 percent), and China (0.41&#13;
percent). Total agricultural research funding increased from about US$50 million to about&#13;
US$66 million from FY1990 to FY1994 and is projected to be about US$82 million in&#13;
FY1995. The share of AARD's budget from external sources was 49 percent in 1992.&#13;
With further increases expected during Repelita VI, it is estimated that the Project will fund&#13;
annually approximately 20 percent of the total expenditures in agricultural research.&#13;
1.11  Indonesia's R&amp;D has contributed significantly to the impressive performance of the&#13;
agricultural sector, the two outstanding benefits being the achievement of self-sufficiency in&#13;
rice and the development of a strong, competitive tree crop sector. It must now continue to&#13;
improve its capacity to address the changing needs and evolving national and sector&#13;
priorities. Particularly, with the limited budgetary resources available, the national R&amp;D&#13;
system must be more efficient and cost-effective and should continue to be well focused on&#13;
the highest priority areas which show the greatest potential benefits to farmers and other&#13;
technology users. Future R&amp;D will have to take into account many changes in the&#13;
agricultural sector during Repelita VI and beyond. These include: (a) decentralization of&#13;
governnent services and greater regionalization of R&amp;D to focus on specific agroecological&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
zones (AEZs) and resource-based development, and the generation of location-specific&#13;
technologies; and (b) emphasis on market-oriented and demand-driven technologies to serve&#13;
changing needs of consumers for higher quality and diversified products.&#13;
D. POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL, LOCATION-SPECIFIC RESEARCH AND&#13;
DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.12 As Indonesia implements its second 25-year national development plan, AARD is&#13;
reorganizing and has established a number of broad objectives intended to lay the&#13;
groundwork for the new era of development. These include:&#13;
(a)   development of technology packages that are location-specific and&#13;
integrated with overall development aims;&#13;
(b)   development of specific agricultural commodities  based on  regional&#13;
comparative advantage;&#13;
(c)   increased diversification in the agricultural production system in relation to&#13;
agro-industrial development and consumer/market requirements;&#13;
(d)   increasing production efficiency in anticipation of the transition to an&#13;
agricultural system based on more capital investment and reduced labor&#13;
requirements;&#13;
(e)   encouraging the shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture to achieve&#13;
greater efficiency of scale;&#13;
(f)   promotion of more balanced development between regions;&#13;
(g)   preservation and protection of the nation's natural resources through the&#13;
development of sustainable agriculture.&#13;
1.13  Policies are guiding planners to base R&amp;D priorities on a number of scientific,&#13;
social, and economic factors. Generally, research has been directed towards: commodities&#13;
that are economically and socially important; commodity development that will foster a&#13;
better economic and resource balance within Indonesia, especially in less developed regions;&#13;
and more basic research, such as biotechnology and new product development. Now, in&#13;
addition, AARD will play a significant role in the regionalization effort of the GOI and&#13;
MOA to attain sustainable diversification of the agricultural sector by enhancing its capacity&#13;
to manage regional R&amp;D and generate location-specific technologies using a farmiing-&#13;
systems approach. This process is expected to increase agriculture's contribution to&#13;
regional economic development, income generation and poverty alleviation.&#13;
1.14  The program strategy will consist of five related activity areas which include:&#13;
(a) regional problem identification, i.e., the status of research-extension-farmer linkages;&#13;
(b) collaboration between research and extension in adapting and 'iepackaging"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technologies; (c) technical demonstrations which bring researchers, extension workers, and&#13;
farmers together; (d) conduct of farmer field days; and (e) more collaborative publishing of&#13;
'liser-friendly" materials and dissemination of information. The emphasis on regional&#13;
production in accordance with local resources and comparative advantage will involve&#13;
interaction with provincial governments in collaboration with the Ministries of Home&#13;
Affairs, and Public Works with the private sector to provide agricultural knowledge and&#13;
research support to appropriate regional activities. Development of human resources to&#13;
assist in meeting these responsibilities will involve interaction with the Ministry of&#13;
Education for linkages with universities in the regions for both research support and&#13;
training. Delivery of agricultural knowledge and technologies in the regions will be&#13;
facilitated by stronger intra-sector linkages with extension and other relevant offices in the&#13;
provinces.&#13;
1.15  Through a Ministerial Decree in December 1994, action has been taken to reorient&#13;
the mandates of 15 commodity research institutes as follows: (a) five in food crops&#13;
(biotechnology, rice, legumes and tuber crops, maize and cereals, and food crops in swampy&#13;
areas; and agriculture in swampy areas); (b) three in horticulture (ornamental plants,&#13;
vegetables, fruit); (c) three in industrial crops (spices and medicinal plants, tobacco and fiber&#13;
crops, coconut and palms; (d) two in livestock (livestock production and animal diseases);&#13;
and (e) three in fisheries (fresh water, marine, and coastal fisheries). Most of the former&#13;
substations of these commodity research institutes have been integrated into the Assessment&#13;
Institutes for Agricultural Technology (AIATs) (see para. 1.16).  The Center for&#13;
Agricultural Research Programming (CARP), supported by the ongoing ARM Project, and&#13;
the AARD Secretariat will continue to provide overall management coordination and&#13;
guidance.&#13;
1.16 At the regional level, 17 AIATs will be established under the Center for Agricultural&#13;
Socio-Economic Research (CASER). The AIATs will be staffed by existing personnel from&#13;
the former Agriculture Information Centers in the provinces, AARD researchers from&#13;
existing research stations and substations already deployed in the regions, and AARD staff&#13;
to be relocated to the regions from the national research institutes. Each AIAT will have a&#13;
Regional Advisory Committee with the head of BAPPEDA as first chair and the provincial&#13;
representative of MOA (KANWEL) as second chair, with members from various DINAS,&#13;
local universities, research institutes, farmer groups, and the private sector. The Regional&#13;
Advisory Committee will provide guidance to the AIAT on the R&amp;D agenda, priorities, and&#13;
policies, and will be assisted by a Regional Technical Working Group, chaired by the AIAT&#13;
Director with representation from various regional agencies. Each AIAT will be headed by&#13;
a Director and will consist of three units: (a) Technical Services, (b) Administration, and&#13;
(c) a Group of researchers and technology transfer staff. Each AIAT will have a&#13;
headquarters and one or more installations in the particular province (support facilities).&#13;
AIATs will link with various groups in their specific regions including universities, DINAS,&#13;
planners and policymakers, the private sector, the extension service and the farmers'&#13;
groups. The Project is based on and will support this reorganization.&#13;

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. BANK INVOLVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH&#13;
2.1   The Bank has strongly supported agricultural R&amp;D in Indonesia since 1975 through&#13;
three agricultural research projects. As a result, the Government has developed, with Bank&#13;
assistance, an impressive research infrastructure and human resource capacity under the&#13;
coordination of AARD. Bank support to AARD began in 1975 with the Agricultural&#13;
Research and Extension Project (Ln. 1179-IND) for US$21.5 million, including US$16.7&#13;
million for research. The project strengthened production-oriented research programs for&#13;
rice, secondary food crops, highland vegetables, and rubber through the provision of&#13;
buildings and equipment, training and technical assistance. The Project Completion Report&#13;
concluded that project objectives have been achieved and that overall, the project was&#13;
successful in supporting the new institutional system for research and extension. The main&#13;
benefits listed were: (a) improved capability and increased coverage of research staff&#13;
through training, which laid the foundation of a professionally competent staff,&#13;
(b) production of new improved varieties of crops; and (c) development and widespread&#13;
propagation of new techniques and packages of practices capable of realizing the full&#13;
potential of the new improved crop varieties.&#13;
2.2   Continuing support was provided to AARD through the National Agricultural&#13;
Research Project (Ln. 1840/Cr. 1014-IND), for US$65 million, which supported more&#13;
broad-based objectives of Repelita m by placing more emphasis on non-rice research, i.e.,&#13;
lowland vegetables, livestock, fisheries, forestry, industrial crops, and estate crops other&#13;
than rubber. The project continued provision for infrastructure, equipment, post-graduate&#13;
training, various types of other training, and long-term and short-term technical assistance.&#13;
Towards the end of this project it was realized that because of the strong emphasis on&#13;
developing facilities and training staff, insufficient attention had been given to management&#13;
and planning the research programs for which those staff and facilities were being provided.&#13;
The rapid build-up of infrastructure and staff was not well-synchronized to ensure their full&#13;
and efficient use. Budgetary provisions lagged behind the increasing requirements for&#13;
operation and maintenance of expanded facilities and equipment. The third operation, the&#13;
ongoing Agricultural Research Management (ARMP) Project (Ln. 303 1-IND) for US$35.3&#13;
million which was implemented in 1989 was therefore designed to address these issues and&#13;
to consolidate and strengthen research planning and management. ARMP addresses the&#13;
efficient use of research resources, mainly in research institutes at the national level with&#13;
mandates to carry out more academic, commodity-oriented research. The proposed project&#13;
would, on the other hand, institutionalize regional, farming-systems R&amp;D in different agro-&#13;
ecological zones (AEZs) and the transfer and wider application of technology in a much&#13;
more applied approach. Preliminary data and evaluation indicate that ARNP has assisted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
substantially in increasing the relevance and cost effectiveness of the national R&amp;D system.&#13;
In addition, AARD has also received Bank support for specific research components&#13;
included in other projects, particularly in transmigration, swamp development, and upland&#13;
and area development.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.3    As economic and agricultural development proceed, demands on the agricultural&#13;
research system have become more exacting, and it will need to be more efficient, flexible&#13;
and responsive to sectoral demands.  At the national level, an effective research&#13;
infrastructure has been built up, more effective planning of relevant, focused research&#13;
programs has been achieved, and the efficient utilization and management of available&#13;
research resources is improving. This is evidenced by the much more systematic planning&#13;
and setting of research priorities, and the increased quality and efficiency of research and&#13;
accountability throughout the system. Provision of operational funds to sustain funding for&#13;
identified research priorities and maintenance of facilities and equipment has also improved,&#13;
and gaps in the availability of trained staff in specialized areas, e.g., virology, post-harvest&#13;
technology, biotechnology, marketing, and socio-econornics are being overcome. Location-&#13;
specific research has, however, not improved at the same pace as national level research.&#13;
2.4   Lessons learned from past operations indicate the need for a better balance between&#13;
c-ommodity-oriented research programs and regional research on location-specific farming&#13;
systems in different AEZs, as well as in the location and distribution of, especially, senior&#13;
research personnel. Efforts should be made to direct a substantially greater and growing&#13;
share of research resources toward the regions and certain AEZs, while maintaining&#13;
adequate support for national research. Effective research-extension-farmer linkages and&#13;
adequate communication with the users of research outputs (farmers, industry, and policy-&#13;
makers) also have to be improved to ensure wider and more immediate use of research&#13;
results.&#13;
2.5    A major lesson learned during the Bank's long association with research projects is&#13;
that it takes time to build research capacity and for institutional changes to evolve to&#13;
improve research efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The successful organization of research&#13;
for managing technological change depends on flexibility, good communications, small&#13;
interdisciplinary teams of researchers, rewards for excellence and accommodation of&#13;
failures, accountability, beneficiary participation, and step-wise innovations. In Indonesia,&#13;
the lessons show that (a) benefits from research yet to be conducted are uncertain and&#13;
difficult to quantify but overall the contribution of research to agricultural development has&#13;
been significant, particularly in rice and tree crops; (b) a decentralized R&amp;D system, with&#13;
strong linkages to local government and other institutions through improved coordination&#13;
mechanisms, is needed to fully tap the benefits gained from national research achievements,&#13;
and to use available local knowledge; and (c) farming systems research, emphasizing&#13;
location-specific and on-farm activities, should be institutionalized in major agroecological&#13;
regions, with particular attention to socio-economic conditions in rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.6   Rapid changes in the agricultural sector in Indonesia require significant changes in&#13;
and upgrading of the current R&amp;D system. The Project would build on the capacity&#13;
established under previous Bank-assisted projects and introduce new approaches to ensure&#13;
greater relevance of research to local conditions. The Bank's long and close association&#13;
with agricultural research in Indonesia, as a major donor, places it in an excellent position to&#13;
provide further assistance and coordination of other donors' support for the introduction of&#13;
major organizational changes to make agricultural research more cost-effective, as foreseen&#13;
under this Project. The Project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
for Indonesia which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on March 21, 1995&#13;
and focuses, inter alia, on inter-regional equity and enhanced competitiveness, delivery of&#13;
higher quality public services, especially to the poor, greater decentralization of&#13;
responsibilities, and improved environmental management. The project would support&#13;
greater decentralization of responsibilities for agricultural research and technology transfer,&#13;
strengthen local institutions and human resources in order to effectively develop,&#13;
disseminate and apply location-specific technologies, thereby enhancing competitiveness,&#13;
provide improved public services to lower income rural communities, and improve&#13;
environmental management by developing and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.&#13;
2.7   The Bank supports the Government in the following key areas: (a) maintaining&#13;
growth with macroeconomic stability; (b) improving public sector management;&#13;
(c) enhancing private sector's role in development; (d) reducing poverty; and (e) improving&#13;
natural resource and environmental management. In agricultural research, the Bank's&#13;
strategy is to support the Government's efforts to (i) generate and transfer location-specific&#13;
technologies through regionalizing the R&amp;D system; (ii) undertake participative planning&#13;
and priority setting involving farmers and other stakeholders; (iii) strengthen research-&#13;
extension linkages; and (iv) improve research management considering agroecological,&#13;
social, economic, cultural, and environmental concerns.   Further strengthening of&#13;
agricultural R&amp;D and increasing its relevance to regional, resource-based development is&#13;
essential to underpin the Government's efforts in these key areas.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PRoJEcr OBJEcrrvEs AND COMPONENTS&#13;
3.1   The main objective of the Project would be to strengthen regional agricultural R&amp;D,&#13;
based on local human and natural resources, by collaboratively developing and transferring&#13;
location-specific technology which is market-oriented and client-driven to support agro-&#13;
business and agro-industry development. This would be achieved through the establishment&#13;
of a network of regional AIATs, improvement of regional research management, expansion&#13;
of research in priority areas, and strengthened linkages to local, national, and international&#13;
institutions, thereby facilitating the delivery of research results to end-users. Specific&#13;
project outcomes for successfully meeting these objectives are included in the Project&#13;
I nplementation Plan (PIP) as indicated in Annex 1. The Project would consist of the&#13;
following four components the costs for which are shown in Annex 1, Table 4:&#13;
(a)   Regionalization of Agricultural R&amp;D (estimated total cost US$53.8&#13;
million). This component will strengthen on-farm research using farming&#13;
systems methodology and facilitate technology transfer in eight&#13;
agroecological regions. The Project will support the establishment and&#13;
operation of eight priority AIATs in 12 provinces in a new regional network&#13;
of 17 AIATs being established by the MOA. The capability of staff in the&#13;
eight AIATs will be increased and their linkages will be strengthened by&#13;
enhancing collaboration and participation of local institutions, such as the&#13;
extension service, DINAS, farmer groups, policymakers, provincial&#13;
universities, the private sector, and community and locally-based&#13;
organizations in regional R&amp;D activities. The eight AIATs will test and&#13;
assist in the dissemination of technologies needed in specific farming systems&#13;
in the selected AEZs.&#13;
(b)   Institutionalization  of R&amp;D  Management at the Regional Level&#13;
(estimated total cost US$17.8 million). This component will introduce&#13;
administrative and management reforms developed under the ARM Project&#13;
at the regional level and improve AARD's capability to respond to changing&#13;
needs of consumers and farmers. It will support common administration and&#13;
management procedures in the 17 AIATs in the network, comprising the&#13;
eight AIATs under the Project and the remaining nine AIATs which will be&#13;
established by GOI with possible assistance of other donors. These new&#13;
procedures would ensure bottom-up planning by characterizing the AEZs,&#13;
and developing regional R&amp;D master plans; improving priority setting and&#13;
resource allocation; strengthening of the regional information system; and&#13;
improving management capabilities of AIAT staff and staff of collaborating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
institutions. Special studies will be carried out on social, gender, and&#13;
cultural issues in collaboration with universities.&#13;
(c)   Support to Priority Commodity and Discipline-Oriented Research&#13;
(estimated total cost US$22.2 million). This component will help accelerate&#13;
the development of new technologies and improve the relevance of research&#13;
conducted by commodity research institutes by getting them to backstop the&#13;
needs of the AIATs. The Project will support research in high priority areas&#13;
by funding priority commodity and discipline-oriented research, particularly&#13;
on livestock, horticulture and plantation crops, fisheries, and selected&#13;
disciplines like biotechnology, agricultural engineering, agribusiness and&#13;
marketing, post-harvest and processing, and sociology/anthropology.&#13;
Research will be carried out by commodity research institutes in support to&#13;
the regional R&amp;D program. The Project will also provide degree and non-&#13;
degree training for AARD staff and technical assistance on special disciplines&#13;
on the priority commodities.&#13;
(d)   Strengthening R&amp;D Collaboration (estimated total cost US$8.0 million).&#13;
This component will improve Indonesia's access to internationally generated&#13;
technologies, tools and methodologies (i.e., farming systems, social and&#13;
gender analysis, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation). It will&#13;
expand the horizon of its scientists by improving collaboration with Asia-&#13;
Pacific and international research centers, other Asia-Pacific national&#13;
research systems, and selected foreign universities. It will also strengthen&#13;
collaboration between the AARD Work Units and the extension service, the&#13;
Directorates General of the MOA, DINAS, policymakers, farmers' groups,&#13;
local governments, the private sector, local universities, and community and&#13;
locally-based organizations. A University Research Grant, and a Scientific&#13;
Exchange Program for researchers and managers will be established to&#13;
promote joint activities between AARD researchers and managers and staff&#13;
of their collaborating institutions.&#13;
B. PRoJEcr DEscRiprIoN&#13;
3.2   Regionalization of Agricultural R&amp;D. AARD is a highly centralized research&#13;
system with strong commodity-orientation. Because of the variability of Indonesia's&#13;
agroecosystems, R&amp;D has to be decentralized to generate, test, and integrate location-&#13;
specific technologies based on farmers' needs and circumstances. This project will provide&#13;
the basis for developing strong and effective regional agricultural R&amp;D capacity by&#13;
supporting the establishment and operation of eight priority AIATs to conduct on-farm&#13;
verification and adaptive research and to facilitate transfer of best technologies to farmers&#13;
and other technology users. The Project will assist AARD in establishing and operating, in a&#13;
phased manner, the following eight priority regional assessment institutes covering 12&#13;
provinces: for Phase I (beginning Year 1) - (a) AIAT Ambon (Maluku), (b) AIAT Gedong&#13;
Johor (North Sumatra), (c) AIAT Kendari (South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Il -&#13;
(d) AIAT Biromaru (Central Sulawesi and North Sulawesi), and for Phase II (beginning&#13;
Year 2) - (e) AIAT Banda Aceh (DI Aceh), (f) AIAT Padang Marpoyan (Riau and Jambi),&#13;
(g) AIAT Pontianak (West Kalimantan), and (h) AIAT Ungaran (Central Java and DI&#13;
Yogyakarta). Through the AIAT, AARD researchers and extension workers transferred to&#13;
AARD will be integrated under one structure. The AIAT staff will collaborate with other&#13;
regional and provincial agencies in planning and implementing a common regional R&amp;D&#13;
program with active participation of university researchers, farmers' groups, extension&#13;
workers, DINAS, the private sector, and community and locally-based organizations. A&#13;
regional forum, to periodically consult with these stakeholders, will be established under the&#13;
Project.&#13;
3.3   The Project will upgrade existing facilities of the former Agricultural Information&#13;
Centers which were transferred to AARD as a result of the reorganization of the MOA, and&#13;
selected AARD substations and experimental farms, and construct new R&amp;D support&#13;
facilities which will be required by the eight priority AIATs, in a phased arrangement.&#13;
Furniture, office and scientific equipment, vehicles, including boats, field implements, multi-&#13;
media production equipment, and books and journals will be provided to the AIAT to&#13;
implement the regional R&amp;D program. Staff capability will be improved by relocating&#13;
specialized staff from other AARD Work Units, limited recruitment, intensive in-service&#13;
training of AIAT staff on selected topics, contracting research to local universities, and&#13;
providing consultants. To give incentives for researchers and managers to move to more&#13;
isolated AIATs to work on farm-level activities, the current incentive system will be&#13;
reviewed and innovative methods of rewarding excellence in R&amp;D and management will be&#13;
introduced. Among others, AARD will consider gender equity in recruitment, promotion,&#13;
career advancement, staff training, and other personnel matters.&#13;
3.4   Using the strategic planning, programming, and priority setting procedures and tools&#13;
developed under the ARM Project, R&amp;D master plans will be prepared, for the four priority&#13;
MIATs in Phase I during Year 1 and then the next four priority AIATs in Phase II during&#13;
Year 2 of the Project. These plans will be based on regional needs and developed using&#13;
participative and bottom-up planning methods. Refinement of the AEZ characteristics will&#13;
be carried out by the AMATs, through diagnostic surveys and analysis of existing&#13;
information. Social and cultural aspects, including gender-related data will be gathered to&#13;
provide benchmark about the role of women, youth, and distinct cultural groups whose&#13;
production is primarily subsistence-oriented, as bases for incorporating these special&#13;
concerns in project activities. Regional MIS databases will be developed, computerized, and&#13;
periodically updated to be utilized for planning, information sharing, and policy formulation.&#13;
Financial and administrative reforms will be introduced to improve the cost effectiveness of&#13;
research, the efficiency of project implementation, and ensure high quality of R&amp;D&#13;
outputs/products.&#13;
3.5   In the past 20 years, AARD research institutes have developed technologies which&#13;
are ready for further adaptation to specific production systems. The technology showcase, a&#13;
menu of recommended technological advances ("gelar teknologi") developed under the&#13;
ARM Project will be continued and expanded to the eight priority regions. Under this&#13;
Project, the AIATs will identify available technologies and assess their fit to farmers' needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
in specific areas. As part of the regional R&amp;D program, relevant component technologies&#13;
generated by the national research institutes will be tested on-station and verified on-farm to&#13;
suit conditions in local farming systems. Following the methodology developed under the&#13;
Research-Extension Linkage (REL) Program of the ARM Project, selected pilot activities&#13;
will be carried out to upscale and integrate the best technologies with the current farm&#13;
practices involving large number of farmers and extension workers. Linkages with local&#13;
universities, farmers' groups, policymakers, DINAS, the extension service, the private&#13;
sector, and community and locally-based oroganizations, will be strengthened to facilitate&#13;
dissemination of improved technologies and sharing of information. The Project will also&#13;
provide R&amp;D support services, such as production of multi-media materials needed by&#13;
extension workers, farmers, and other development workers in the project areas.&#13;
3.6  Institutionalization of R&amp;D Management at the Regional Level. In the past five&#13;
years, under the ARM Project, AARD has developed administrative and management&#13;
procedures, mechanisms, and tools and introduced management reforms at the national level&#13;
to improve the quality of research and relevance of research outputs to technology users.&#13;
Under this Project, these management and administrative reforms will be introduced to the&#13;
network of 17 AIATs at the regional level. The Project will support common activities to:&#13;
(a) develop a regional MIS network, (b) strengthen regional research planning and&#13;
management, including priority setting, monitoring, and evaluation; (c) improve regional&#13;
financial management and administrative procedures, such as accounting, auditing, and&#13;
technical audit; (d) improve research station management; and (e) review the current&#13;
incentive system and introduce innovations to improve it.&#13;
3.7   As the GOI, with possible assistance from other donors, will establish and operate&#13;
the remaining nine AIATs, the Project will assist the AARD to set up common&#13;
administrative and management procedures in 17 AIATs in the network, to ensure that&#13;
planning, priority setting, resource allocation, monitoring and evaluation, and financial&#13;
management procedures are standardized across regions. The remaining nine AIATs and&#13;
the provinces covered include: AIAT Karangploso (East Java and Bali), AIAT Koya Barat&#13;
(Irian Jaya), AIAT Lembang (West Java and DKI Jakarta), AIAT Natar (Lampung), AIAT&#13;
Naibonat (East Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara, and East Timor), AMAT Palangkaraya&#13;
(Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan), AIAT Puntikayu (South Sumatra), AMAT&#13;
Samarinda (East Kalimantan), and AIAT Sukarami (West Sumatra and Bengkulu). Under&#13;
the coordination of AARD Secretariat and the PMU, the AIATs will organize short-term&#13;
skill-building training seminars and provide technical assistance on specific management&#13;
topics and provide degree training for selected AIAT staff.  Specialized equipment,&#13;
furniture, vehicles, and consumables will be provided for these activities. The refinement of&#13;
the AEZ characteristics and development of R&amp;D master plans will be completed in the&#13;
remaining nine AIATs in a phased manner, including preparation, mass production, and&#13;
distribution of multi-media materials to support technology transfer activities.&#13;
3.8   Using the peer review procedures and criteria introduced under the ARM Project,&#13;
regional R&amp;D proposals will be evaluated and the outputs of the projects will be reviewed&#13;
annually in a regional venue. The members of the Regional Technical Working Groups and&#13;
other regional scientists and development workers will form panels of reviewers to assist the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
AIAT in this activity. An annual planning and review mechanism will be established to&#13;
ensure consultation with stakeholders and active participation of farmers, extension&#13;
workers, policymakers, DINAS, the private sector, and community and locally-based&#13;
organizations in AIAT activities. To justify increased appropriations for agricultural R&amp;D,&#13;
especially at the regional level, special studies will be undertaken with assistance from&#13;
consultants and university researchers, on impact of research, economic benefits of R&amp;D&#13;
interventions, and effect of cultural and gender roles in the farming systems.&#13;
3.9   Through the ARM Project, CALREC has strengthened the national communication&#13;
network and scientific literature service, providing a communication service for scientists in&#13;
the national research system. This service will now have to be linked to the 17 AIATs in&#13;
the regional R&amp;D network to improve commnunication between the commodity research&#13;
institutes and the ALATs and across regions. The linkage of CALREC and AIATs to other&#13;
national databases (i.e., through IPTEKNET) and to international databases (i.e., through&#13;
INTERNET) will be established under the Project. The MIS databases will be streamlined&#13;
to conform with AIAT information needs and the type of survey data gathered from the&#13;
AEZ characterization activities. Short-term training and technical assistance on information&#13;
technology fields, including the New Government Accounting System (NGAS), will be&#13;
provided to strengthen the capability of AIAT staff, which is currently very weak. Training&#13;
will emphasize capability building on management of integrated R&amp;D programs and team&#13;
building, use of management tools and mechanisms, effectiveness of rural organizational&#13;
models, social and gender analysis methods, applied communications methods, and&#13;
strengthening research-extension-farmer linkages. In addition, the Project will support a&#13;
regional soil fertility and fertilizer use program to be implemented in three regional locations&#13;
in Medan (North Sumatra), Yogyakarta (D.I. Yogyakarta) and Maros (South Sulawesi)&#13;
which will provide soil and plant analysis services to provide farmers with location-specific&#13;
fertilizer recommendations in collaboration with existing agencies. CSAR will coordinate&#13;
the soils service laboratories network and provide training and support services to the&#13;
AITs.&#13;
3.10  The Project will also support the exchange of scientists and managers across regions&#13;
(among AIATs) and between AlATs and the commodity research institutes and centers. To&#13;
ensure an effective project implementation, support will be provided to CARP, AARD&#13;
Secretariat, and the PMU to coordinate overall project implementation and the activities&#13;
under Components 3 and 4 of the Project. Support will also be provided to CASER and the&#13;
eight PIUs to coordinate the activities of the AIATs at the regional level (Components 1&#13;
and 2). The Project will provide office equipment (computers, typewriters, calculators),&#13;
office furniture, vehicles, books and journals, technical assistance, and training.&#13;
3.11 Priority Commodity and Discipline-Oriented Research Programs. One of the&#13;
major components of the ARM Project is the support for research in commodity research&#13;
institutes, including a university grant scheme involving scientists outside AARD. This&#13;
Project will continue to support commodity research institutes in selected high priority&#13;
areas, including the University Research Grant, focusing on fisheries, livestock, horticulture&#13;
and tree crops, and selected disciplines, such as biotechnology, agricultural engineering,&#13;
agribusiness and marketing, postharvest and processing, and sociology and anthropology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
An important criterion in selecting research proposals is that the research will support the&#13;
regional R&amp;D programs under the AIATs. The selected priority topics include: (a) animal&#13;
feeding and nutrition, (b) animal breeding emphasizing selection and preservation of&#13;
indigenous breeds; (c) control of major diseases of chickens, goats and cattle; (d) tuna stock&#13;
assessment and formulation of a management plan; (e) diversification of marine and fresh&#13;
water finfish aquaculture; (f) environmental management for aquaculture, including&#13;
management of diseases; (g) development of superior hybrids/clones of horticultural and&#13;
tree crops; (h) integrated management of diseases and pests and soil fertility management of&#13;
horticultural and tree crops; (i) development of post-harvest and processing management&#13;
systems for fruit, vegetables, and tree crops; (j) biotechnology research; (k) improvement of&#13;
appropriate tools and implements; (1) market studies; and (m) socio-cultural studies&#13;
including gender-related topics.&#13;
3.12 Research proposals from commodity research institutes will be evaluated by CARP&#13;
based on existing peer review methods and criteria developed under the ARM Project. The&#13;
national research program component should be flexible to consider other areas to be&#13;
identified during the preparation of the regional R&amp;D master plans and spin-off projects&#13;
identified during project implementation. In selected commodity research institutes, some&#13;
existing specialized laboratories will be rehabilitated and scientific equipment will be&#13;
provided to make them operational. The Project will support very limited new construction,&#13;
such as the bio-containment facility for the Research Institute for Food Crops&#13;
Biotechnology in Bogor, which will serve relevant institutes in the agricultural&#13;
biotechnology network. The Project will also provide furniture, vehicles, consumables,&#13;
technical assistance, and training on selected scientific topics.&#13;
3.13 The National Human Resource Development (HRD) Program is a continuation of&#13;
the past efforts, funded through earlier Bank-supported research projects (National&#13;
Agricultural Research I, II, and ARM Project), which developed a strong national&#13;
agricultural research system for Indonesia. With the regionalization of R&amp;D, new disciplines&#13;
covering both technical and management fields will have to be put in place. The emphasis of&#13;
degree and non-degree training under the National HRD Program are the fields included in&#13;
the priority commodity and discipline-oriented research programs described in para. 3.11.&#13;
Focus will be given to capability-building in areas which are still limited in AARD, such as&#13;
agricultural economics and marketing, sociology and anthropology, postharvest and&#13;
agroprocessing, applied communication, agricultural extension, and research management.&#13;
Short-term technical assistance will be provided based on specific needs of the research&#13;
programs to assist in the conduct of special studies where expertise is still limited. Long-&#13;
term consultants will mainly be involved in research management areas to assist in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.14  Strengthening R&amp;D  Collaboration.   Collaborative R&amp;D  and management&#13;
activities will be strengthened at two levels: (a) at the national level among national agencies&#13;
and AARD research units especially with universities, the private sector, and community&#13;
and locally-based organizations; and (b) at the regional (Asia-Pacific) and international&#13;
levels between international agricultural research centers under the Consultative Group for&#13;
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), selected Asia-Pacific national agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
research systems and foreign universities. Collaboration with external groups will be&#13;
demand-driven, considering priority needs of Indonesia in both technical and research&#13;
management fields. These collaborative activities will enhance Indonesia's access to new&#13;
scientific information, improved technologies, and standard research methodologies. The&#13;
Project will support (i) joint research, (ii) hands-on training, (iii) technical assistance;&#13;
(iv) scientists/managers exchange; and (v) information sharing. Joint proposals by AARD&#13;
Work Units and collaborating institutions will be prepared and evaluated by CARP and the&#13;
PMU using criteria and procedures to be established by AARD and concurred with by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.15  The competitive research grant program for universities (the University Research&#13;
Grant), which was started in the ARM Project, will be continued, emphasizing the role of&#13;
local universities and twinning arrangements between a provincial university, a more&#13;
advanced university elsewhere, and AARD Work Units. The Project will also strengthen&#13;
R&amp;D linkages with the extension service, policymakers, the Directorates General under the&#13;
MOA, DINAS, the private sector, community and locally-based organizations, and other&#13;
development projects, in the areas of comparative advantage in the region. Joint proposals&#13;
will be reviewed by a special AARD Research Grant Board using criteria and methods used&#13;
under the ARM Project, which will be modified, as needed (Annex 2). Agreements were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the first five subprojects considered under the University&#13;
Research Grant will be provided to the Bank for review before final approval by the&#13;
Research Grant Board. Collaboration on research and training with international and&#13;
regional research centers, will be encouraged, emphasizing the contributions from other&#13;
national agricultural research systems in the Asia-Pacific region. The exposure of&#13;
Indonesian scientists and managers to international and regional fora will be enhanced by&#13;
providing them with the opportunity to spend time in collaborating research centers,&#13;
supporting a scientists/managers exchange program, and encouraging the publication of&#13;
AARD scientists in international journals in partnership with staff of collaborating&#13;
institutions abroad. The Project will also support the conduct or joint sponsorship of&#13;
international or regional conferences, seminars, and workshops to be held in Indonesia.&#13;
Particular attention will be given to ensuring the participation of scientists in AIAT&#13;
activities. Special studies will be conducted with universities on selected topics related to&#13;
environmental, social, cultural, and gender issues to monitor the impact of research outputs&#13;
on these special groups and to the environment.&#13;
C. TRAINING&#13;
3.16  Human resource development and training are an important part of the project&#13;
components described above. The new regional R&amp;D approach will require considerable&#13;
reorientation and retraining of staff who, up to now, have been working mainly in&#13;
commodity-oriented component research. A training schedule has been proposed which&#13;
would enable about 25 percent of newly appointed AIAT staff, including scientists,&#13;
technical, and administrative support staff, to participate in appropriate overseas or local&#13;
degree and diploma training over the six-year project period. In addition, significant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
funding has been provided for short-term, non-degree/diploma training, including overseas&#13;
but mainly local, to strengthen staff capability in specific skills required to effectively carry&#13;
out the regional R&amp;D programs. About 80 percent of the total training funds will be&#13;
provided for training staff at regional level. The remaining 20 percent of total training funds&#13;
would be provided for training national level scientists and managers working in priority&#13;
research areas. The criteria for selecting trainees will include gender equity to give equal&#13;
opportunities for women to enhance their roles as scientists and managers in AIATs and in&#13;
commodity research institutes.&#13;
D. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
3.17 The technical assistance required to implement the four project components,&#13;
comprising both international and local consultants, will assist in strengthening the&#13;
capability of AIAT staff at the regional level in research management, technical, and&#13;
technology transfer fields (see Annex 4). Recognizing that AARD has well qualified and&#13;
experienced staff, the level of technical assistance required in the proposed project is less&#13;
than 10 percent of the total project cost. The Project will provide funds for a total of 60&#13;
staff-months of long-term intemational consultants for research management as well as 92&#13;
staff-months of short-term  intemational consultants.  About 22 staff-months of the&#13;
intemational short-term consultancies will be devoted to the refinement of the AEZs and&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the soil testing/soil fertility programs. The balance of 70&#13;
staff-months will be for 22 different specialists in various disciplines. In addition, the&#13;
Project will provide funds for 96 staff-months of long-term local consultants for a financial&#13;
specialist (60 staff-months) and civil works specialist (36 staff-months). About 183 staff-&#13;
months of short-term local consultants will be provided in various areas of research&#13;
management and project programs such as MIS, technology transfer, development&#13;
communication, technical disciplines, sociology/anthropology including gender and cultural&#13;
issues, and architectural/civil works supervision. All areas for which consultants are&#13;
required have been identified and details of the requirements by project component are&#13;
shown in Annex 4. Brief terms of reference (TORs) were prepared and submitted to the&#13;
Bank. AARD has prepared detailed terms of reference for the long-term consultants to be&#13;
hired during Year 1 of the project. Detailed TORs, including draft letters of invitation, and&#13;
a proposed short-list of consultants have been furnished to the Bank, as well as details of&#13;
both degree and non-degree training to be implemented during Year 1.&#13;
E. ENvIRONmENTAL IMPAcT&#13;
3.18  The Project is rated as Category C: "No appreciable environmental impact." The&#13;
completed project should have a positive effect on the environment by encouraging the&#13;
sustainable use of localized resource mixes and by facilitating the generation and wider&#13;
adoption of more sustainable and environment-friendly technology, including available&#13;
conservation farming techniques, in different agroecological regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
F. SociAL AND GENDER ISSUES&#13;
3.19  In addition to the technical aspects of R&amp;D, the Project will introduce steps to&#13;
address the social and cultural dimensions, where relevant, including gender-related issues,&#13;
and the use of tools (i.e., social and gender analysis of the farming systems, participatory&#13;
planning) in determining the research and technology transfer agenda and in implementing&#13;
project activities. This will ensure that women, youth, and distinct cultural groups whose&#13;
production is primarily subsistence-oriented will directly benefit from project interventions&#13;
because activities are based on their specific needs and role in the household and in the&#13;
agricultural production systems. Benchmark information on social and cultural aspects will&#13;
be gathered during diagnostic surveys as part of the AEZ characterization. This will be&#13;
used in regional R&amp;D planning and in integrating specific social, cultural, and gender-&#13;
related concerns in project activities, especially in areas traditionally the prerogative of&#13;
women such as fruit and vegetable processing, fish handling and marketing, home gardens,&#13;
etc. Special gender and cultural studies will be carried out in collaboration with universities&#13;
to determine their specific needs and the effect of technological innovations on these special&#13;
groups. The active participation of women, youth, and distinct cultural groups will be&#13;
sought in relevant project activities and their representation in regional fora and project-&#13;
related committees. Issues of participation of women staff in training, recruitment of&#13;
women staff in the AIATs, equity in promotion of staff, and other gender-related&#13;
management issues will be incorporated in the research management component of this&#13;
Project. Social and gender issues will be included in the periodic monitoring of on-farm&#13;
utilization of improved technologies through special studies conducted with universities.&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
4.1   This chapter gives a summary of the PIP which was prepared in conjunction with&#13;
the Borrower and reviewed and deemed satisfactory by the Bank. The PIP is presented as&#13;
Annex 1 and gives detailed information on project description, costs, financing,&#13;
management and implementation arrangements, disbursement, progress reporting, and&#13;
status of implementation.&#13;
B. PROJECT COST&#13;
4.2   Total cost of the ARM II Project is estimated at US$101.8 million, about Rp 223.3&#13;
billion equivalent, including contingencies, taxes, and duties. Total base cost is estimated at&#13;
US$86.7 million. Physical contingencies amount to about US$4.6 million and price&#13;
contingencies about US$10.5 million over the project implementation period.  Total&#13;
contingencies amount to 17 percent of base cost. The foreign exchange component is&#13;
estimated at US$23.9 million, including contingencies, or about 23 percent of project costs.&#13;
Taxes and duties are estimated at US$3.8 million equivalent.&#13;
4.3   Total base costs are divided between:  (a) Investment Costs (49 percent)&#13;
comprising Civil Works; Furniture, Equipment; Computers, Journals; Boats and Vehicles;&#13;
Training; Technical Assistance, Research Collaboration; University Research Grants; and&#13;
Scientists/Managers Exchange Program; and (b) Incremental Operating Costs (51 percent)&#13;
directly attributable to the Project, comprising Research Management Costs; Operating and&#13;
Maintenance Costs; Research Operations Costs; and Technology Transfer Costs. The level&#13;
of incremental operating costs is considered justified in view of the additional management,&#13;
research, and technology transfer activities at the AIATs required under the regionalization&#13;
program of AARD. Overall, about 70 percent of total base costs will be incurred at the&#13;
regional level mainly to support the eight priority AIATs (Components 1 and 2) and&#13;
30 percent of the costs will be incurred at the national level (Components 3 and 4). The&#13;
estimated cost distribution among project components is shown in Table 4.1 below. Further&#13;
summary cost tables are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 of Annex 1.&#13;
C. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
4.4   The Bank will provide loan funds equivalent to US$63.0 million equivalent or&#13;
62 percent of total project costs, comprising 93 percent of foreign exchange cost&#13;

will finance approximately US$38.8 million or 38 percent of project costs, including taxes&#13;
and duties (estimated at US$3.8 million). The financing of project costs would be divided&#13;
between IBRD and GOI as follows:&#13;
(a)    IBRD will finance 70 percent of Civil Works including some construction of&#13;
new buildings where necessary at the AIAT headquarters to accommodate&#13;
transferred staff but also for the rehabilitation and expansion of existing&#13;
buildings where appropriate; 80 percent of Furniture, Equipment, and&#13;
Journals (including computers); 100 percent of Overseas Training;&#13;
75 percent of Local Training; 80 percent of Foreign and Local Technical&#13;
Assistance; 80 percent of Research Collaboration; 75 percent of University&#13;
Research Grants; 80 percent of Scientists/Managers Exchange Program; and&#13;
50 percent of Incremental Operating Costs based on a three-stage reducing&#13;
scale of funding starting at 60 percent in Years 1 and 2, and declining to&#13;
50 percent in Years 3 and 4 and to 40 percent in Years 5 and 6. An&#13;
indicative forecast of the respective funding shares of incremental operating&#13;
costs is shown in Appendix 1 of Annex 1. GOI will maintain levels of&#13;
operational expenditures at or above those projected in this Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report as loan funds for this purpose are reduced. A schedule of the Loan&#13;
categories for disbursement is shown in Appendix 1 of Annex 1.&#13;
(b)    GOI will finance 30 percent of Civil Works; 20 percent of Furniture,&#13;
Equipment and Journals; 25 percent of Local Training; 20 percent of Foreign&#13;
and Local TA; 100 percent of Boats and Vehicles; 20 percent of Research&#13;
Collaboration; 25 percent of University Research Grants; 20 percent of&#13;
Scientists/Managers Exchange Program; and 50 percent of Incremental&#13;
Operating Costs and all taxes and duties based on the current 10 percent&#13;
value added tax on contracts for Civil Works, Furniture, Equipment and&#13;
other goods and materials.&#13;

D). ADMINISTRATION OF PROJECr FUNDS&#13;
4.5   The Bank Loan of US$63.0 million equivalent will be made to GOI, which would&#13;
make the funds available to AARD through the normal government budgetary process. As&#13;
approximately 70 percent of project costs will be incurred at the regional level, funding&#13;
from GOI will flow directly, through the provincial PIMBAGPRO, to the AIATs based on&#13;
budgets which will be agreed and approved by the respective Regional Advisory&#13;
Committees. Any funds provided by provincial governments to assist in the financing of&#13;
AIAT operations will be considered part of counterpart funds provided by GOI.&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs will be financed by IBRD on a reducing scale starting at&#13;
60 percent in Year 1 and reducing to 50 percent in Year 3 then to 40 percent in Year 5. To&#13;
ensure adequate funding for the new network of 17 AIATs as well as for the existing&#13;
national research network, assurances have been obtained that GOI will increase AARD's&#13;
R&amp;D expenditures by a minimum of 3 percent per annum in real terms over the six-year&#13;
project period (FY1996-FY2001).&#13;
E. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.6   The project will be implemented over six years by AARD and its work units.&#13;
Component I would be implemented in two overlapping five-year phases, with each phase&#13;
covering four AIATs. At the regional level, the AIATs will be staffed by existing personnel&#13;
from the former Agricultural Information Centers (BIPs), AARD researchers already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
deployed in the regions in existing research centers and substations, additional AARD staff&#13;
to be relocated to the AlATs from national research institutes, and extension workers who&#13;
will be reassigned to the AIATs. An overall plan for the development of the entire network&#13;
of 17 AIATs, including staffing, and detailed annual work programs for the four AIATs in&#13;
phase one and the priority R&amp;D areas for the first project year have been furnished to the&#13;
Bank. Participatory research management mechanisms will be introduced to the regions to&#13;
ensure high quality and relevance of technology to local conditions and to strengthen the&#13;
linkages of the AIATs to farmers, local governments, universities, the private sector,&#13;
community and locally-based organizations, and other development projects. A Regional&#13;
Advisory Committee, supported by a Technical Working Group, will provide guidance to&#13;
the AIATs on the R&amp;D agenda, technology dissemination, and training. Farmers and other&#13;
stakeholders will be well represented in these regional bodies. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained that annual work programs, approved by the Regional Advisory Committees and&#13;
processed in accordance with GOI procedures, will be submitted to the Bank by December&#13;
31 each year. Project management/implementing units at both national and regional levels&#13;
will utilize existing structures and procedures of the agencies in which they reside to carry&#13;
out project operations, including fund releases, accounting, and auditing. Emphasis will be&#13;
given to local participation to ensure commitments of local agencies and their active&#13;
participation in decision-making at that level. Back-stopped by AARD at the national level,&#13;
provincial governments would be expected to take increasing responsibility in managing&#13;
regional R&amp;D, including its funding.&#13;
4.7   The organizational set-up of the Project is shown in Chart 3 (in Annex 1) of the PIP.&#13;
Implementation will be at two levels: (a) regional, through the AIATs under CASER, for&#13;
Components 1 and 2, and (b) national, through the AARD Headquarters (CARP and&#13;
AARD Secretariat) and various research centers/mstitutes (for Components 3 and 4). A&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU) has been established in the AARD Headquarters to&#13;
coordinate overall project implementation, including the implementation of Components 3&#13;
and 4. A National Advisory Committee will provide guidance to the AARD Director&#13;
General on ARMP II matters. At the regional level, a small Project Implementing Unit&#13;
(PIU) has been established within each priority AIAT, to implement project activities.&#13;
Assurances have been obtained that Regional Advisory Committees and Regional Technical&#13;
Working Groups for the four AIATs in Phase II, as weli as all key AIAT staff will be&#13;
appointed by October 1, 1995.&#13;
4.8   The Project will require an average of about 17 staff-weeks per annum of Bank&#13;
supervision during the six-year implementation period. Project supervision will be linked to&#13;
the cluster supervisions to be undertaken by the Bank's Resident Mission in Indonesia. A&#13;
mid-term review of the Project's progress of implementation is planned during the third year&#13;
of the Project (para. 4.25).&#13;
F. PROJECT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.9   The AARD Secretariat and the PMU will be responsible for the overall coordination&#13;
of procurement activities and the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurement processes.  The progress of procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
activities will be monitored by the AARD Secretariat and the PMU, and periodic reports on&#13;
procurement progress, including variations in schedules and work plans will be reported to&#13;
the Bank on a regular basis.&#13;
4.10   The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 below:&#13;

4.11 Civil Works (US$11.6 million). These are for about 18 small packages of civil&#13;
works scattered through 12 provinces in which international contractors will not be&#13;
interested, and therefore, would be procured in individual contracts valued at less than&#13;
US$1.5 million up to an aggregated amount of US$11.6 million using NCB procedures and&#13;
standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank. The civil works under the Project will&#13;
concentrate on renovating existing facilities for the AIATs, with some additional new&#13;
construction, where necessary, to accommodate the new mandate and additional staff to be&#13;
transferred to the AIAT headquarters and their support facilities. About 70 percent of the&#13;
civil works will be undertaken at AIAT headquarters and 30 percent for renovation or&#13;
construction of installations. Contracts in excess of USS750,000 in value will be subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the Bank's prior review and contracts at or below this level will be subject to SOE&#13;
disbursement procedures and post procurement review on a random check basis. A&#13;
summary of the packages and schedule for procurement of civil works is presented in&#13;
Annex 1, Table 5.&#13;
4.12 Goods (US$13.4 million). Equipment including computers and scientific equipment&#13;
(for AIATs, Livestock, Fisheries, Horticulture, Soils Laboratories, and Post Harvest&#13;
Equipment) will be procured through ICB procedures using the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents. Local manufacturers would be given a margin of preference of 15 percent CIF&#13;
price or actual import duties whichever is lower. Items including office furniture and&#13;
equipment (desks, cabinets, typewriters, etc.), farm and field equipment (tractors, tillers,&#13;
harrows, etc.) guest house furniture and equipment (chairs, beds, etc.) and scientific&#13;
consumables (test tubes, flasks, etc.), and small items of equipment up to US$500 packaged&#13;
in contracts valued at less than US$200,000 up to an aggregated amount of US$2.0 million&#13;
would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IBRD. Some items in packages&#13;
valued at less than US$25,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$0.7 million would be&#13;
procured through shopping procedures obtaining quotations from at least three suppliers.&#13;
Books and Journals would be procured directly from reputable publishers in packages&#13;
valued at less than US$10,000 up to an amount of US$750,000. GOI has indicated that&#13;
vehicles totaling US$2.0 million will be reserved for local manufacturers. Assurances have&#13;
been obtained that the budget is allocated for this procurement based on a schedule&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. All ICB contracts will be subject to prior review and those&#13;
contracts less than US$200,000 subject to NCB and National Shopping (NS) procedures&#13;
will be subject to SOE disbursement procedures and a post procurement review on a&#13;
random check basis. A summary of the packages and schedule for the procurement of&#13;
goods is presented in Annex 1, Table 6.&#13;
4.13  Training (US$8.9 million). Foreign and local training costs currently estimated at&#13;
about US$8.9 million will be procured by AARD in accordance with procedures established&#13;
during the ARM Project, namely on the basis of the relevance and quality of the programs&#13;
offered in accordance with GOI administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank. All&#13;
training would be subject to the Bank's SOE disbursement procedures.&#13;
4.14 Technical Assistance (US$4.8 million). Consultants services for implementation&#13;
and specialist technical assistance, management support and special studies totaling some&#13;
US$ 4.8 million will be awarded according to Bank Guidelines for the use of consultant&#13;
services. Detailed timetable, work program, and terms of reference of consultants will be&#13;
prepared by the PIUs concerned and submitted to the PMU for coordination purposes and&#13;
for submission to the Bank for prior review. Contracts for consultant services will be&#13;
entered into by the AIATs responsible for supervising the consultants' activities. TA&#13;
contracts for firms of US$100,000 or less and for individuals of US$50,000 or less will be&#13;
subject to SOE disbursement procedures.&#13;
4.15  Research  CoBaboration  (US$2.6  million).   Research  and  development&#13;
collaboration is the cost involved in establishing relationships and carrying out selected&#13;
R&amp;D projects with national agencies, Asia-Pacific and international research organizations,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
foreign universities, and the private sector, and community and locally-based organizations.&#13;
Collaborative research will be undertaken utilizing GOI procedures and criteria acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
4.16 University Research Grants (US$2.2 million). Grants to Universities for research&#13;
will be undertaken on a competitive basis and be reviewed by an AARD Research Grant&#13;
Board in accordance with GOI procedures developed during the ARM Project which are&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.17  Scientists/Managers Exchange Program  (US$3.2 million).  The exchange&#13;
program will be undertaken utilizing GOI procedures and criteria acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.18 Incremental Operating Costs (US$53.1 million). Incremental recurrent costs&#13;
consisting of Research Management, Operations and Maintenance, Research Operations&#13;
and Technology Transfer costs which include many small items of expenditure such as&#13;
office expenditure, travel, farmers field days, planning meetings, monitoring activities, hired&#13;
labor, etc. would be paid following GOI administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
and the procedures developed under the ARM Project. Such expenditure would be subject&#13;
to the Bank's SOE disbursement procedures.&#13;
4.19  Procurement Review&#13;
Civil Works. Ten NCB contracts (out of 18) which equal or exceed USS750,000&#13;
in value, and aggregating USS10.4 million would be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Goods. Fourteen ICB contracts which equal or exceed USS200,000 and aggregate&#13;
approximately US$10.0 million and the first six contracts other than ICB regardless&#13;
of their value would be subject to Bank's prior review.&#13;
Consultancy Services. Contracts for companies at or above US$100,000 and for&#13;
individuals at or above US$50,000 aggregating an estimated US$2.0 million would&#13;
be subject to prior review by the Bank&#13;
Collaborative Research, University Research Grants, Scientists/Managers Exchange&#13;
Program and Incremental Operating Costs would not be subject to prior review but&#13;
together with other items not subject to prior review would be subject to selective post&#13;
award review on a samnple basis during supervision missions by the Bank.&#13;
Prior review items will total some US$24.4 million or 24 percent of total project cost and&#13;
39 percent of the Bank's financed program.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.20 The Bank loan of US$63.0 million equivalent is expected to be disbursed over a six-&#13;
year period. This is considered consistent with the strong implementation capacity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
AARD as shown by the ARM Project experience and takes into account the complexity of&#13;
the Project in reaching out to the regions. A summary of estimated disbursements by year is&#13;
presented in Table 4.4 below.&#13;

of expenditures incurred in FY1996 and FY1997; 50 percent of expenditures&#13;
incurred in FY1998 and FY1999; and 40 percent of expenditures incurred&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
4.22  For disbursement purposes, full documentation will be required for all contracts at&#13;
or exceeding the following amounts: (a) for civil works, US$750,000; (b) for goods&#13;
US$200,000; (c) for technical assistance contracts with firms US$100,000, and (d) for&#13;
contracts with individuals USS50,000. For all expenditure in those categories below the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
limits specified and for expenditure on training, research collaboration, university research&#13;
grants, scientists/managers exchange program, and incremental operating costs,&#13;
disbursements will be made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
This documentation will be available for the required audit and also to Bank supervision&#13;
missions, and will be retained by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of&#13;
the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.&#13;
4.23  In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government would establish a Special&#13;
Account in the amount of US$3.5 million in Bank Indonesia, or at a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. This account should be maintained by the Directorate General of&#13;
Budget, MOF. The Special Account would be used for all eligible foreign and local&#13;
expenditures under all categories. Replenishment to the Special Account will be made on a&#13;
monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used on the basis of&#13;
replenishment requests with supporting documents satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
H. PROJECT AUDIT REPORTING&#13;
4.24 Project Accounts, the Special Account, and SOEs will be audited in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's 'Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by&#13;
the World Bank" for East Asia and Pacific Region (July 1992). The PIP contains details of&#13;
project auditing, including technical audit.&#13;
L PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATioN&#13;
4.25  A monitoring and evaluation scheme will be established for periodically assessing&#13;
the progress of implementation of the proposed activities in terms of attainment of&#13;
objectives.   Agreed performance indicators for the four components and major&#13;
subcomponents are indicated in Section 5 of the PIP (Annex 1) and will be used as a basis&#13;
for project reporting. Systems for monitoring accounting and auditing will be implemented&#13;
by the PMU and all PIUs. The PMU will audit quality through spot checks on various&#13;
activities throughout the project period. Each will prepare a semi-annual progress report on&#13;
the project performance (physical and financial) using GOI internal accounting and&#13;
reporting systems and procedures, and submit these to the PMU. The PMU will compile&#13;
the AIAT reports and prepare a summary in English to be submitted to the Director General&#13;
of AARD who will arrange to send a copy to the Bank. A detailed schedule for project&#13;
review and reporting is given in the PIP (Annex 1). The performance indicators indicated in&#13;
the PIP will be reviewed during supervision missions conducted jointly by GOI and the&#13;
Bank. Assurances have been obtained that a joint mid-term evaluation would be undertaken&#13;
about three years after the start of project implementation or by about September 30, 1998,&#13;
to assess the progress of the Project. Assurances have also been obtained that arrangements&#13;
will be made for technical audit of project activities, on a sample basis in accordance with&#13;
agreed terms of reference, by the Inspectorate General of Agriculture with technical audit&#13;
reports submitted annually by July 3 1, to the Bank for review and comments.&#13;
&#13;

J. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
4.26  The Project was prepared entirely by AARD  itself in conjunction with&#13;
representatives of regional and provincial agencies using a participatory, bottom-up&#13;
approach, ensuring a high degree of project ownership at all levels. An AARD Project&#13;
Preparation Team, with a core group of full-time members was formed which visited all&#13;
project provinces to interact with regional and provincial authorities and staff and to collect&#13;
precise local data and establish a provincial regional R&amp;D agenda based on local resources,&#13;
priorities, and constraints. Provincial preparation teams, consisting of core teams (three&#13;
members), were organized and were responsible for compiling and analyzing essential&#13;
information and data, together with representatives of the provincial agricultural services,&#13;
local government, AARD research institutes and substations, and universities. The tuna&#13;
research proposal was prepared with input from the South Pacific Commission's Oceanic&#13;
Fisheries Program  (SPC-OFP).  During preparation, the following documents were&#13;
prepared by AARD: (a) an Agricultural Research Policy Statement (1994-1999); (b) a&#13;
Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research and Development for the period 1995-2005; (c) an&#13;
Economic Impact Assessment of AARD's research programs in vegetables, estate crops,&#13;
fruit, livestock and fisheries; and (d) a Project Operational Manual including a project&#13;
implementation plan, a Soil Fertility and Fertilizer Use Study and Proposed Program, and a&#13;
number of working and background papers, as well as provincial profiles. These documents&#13;
are in the project file.&#13;
4.27 Implementation and coordination responsibilities within AARD and between AARD&#13;
and other agencies and regional authorities have been defined. The organizational structure&#13;
to be implemented under the project, requiring the reorganization of AARD to establish a&#13;
network of AIATs as proposed, has been approved by the Ministry of Administrative&#13;
Reform and a Ministerial Decree officially establishing the new organization has been issued&#13;
by the Minister of Agriculture in December 1994. For the four AIATs to be established in&#13;
Phase I, detailed design for the civil works to be constructed/rehabilitated in the first project&#13;
year, including soil testing laboratories, and detailed annual work programs for Year 1 have&#13;
been prepared and furnished to the Bank. For the additional four AIATs in Phase II,&#13;
detailed designs for the civil works will be prepared during Year 1 of the project and&#13;
completed by March 31, 1996. AARD is in the process of making arrangements for&#13;
suitable staffing of the AIATs, , using AARD staff already deployed in the regions, and has&#13;
been considering various incentive schemes to attract additional experienced staff to move&#13;
to regional locations. These include strengthened and priority budgetary support and&#13;
enhanced training opportunities. Other schemes under consideration include allowances and&#13;
increased opportunities for promotion through rotational (or zig zag) assignments between&#13;
AIATs and commodity research institutes and part-time teaching assignments at local&#13;
universities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFTs&#13;
5.1   The benefits of the Project would be wide-spread throughout the agriculture sector,&#13;
as reflected in more effective and efficient management and use of R&amp;D resources,&#13;
especially at the regional and provincial levels. A focus on agribusiness and agro-industry&#13;
would broaden the beneficiaries of research outputs to include those involved in the&#13;
postharvest, processing, and marketing end of the agricultural production spectrum. With&#13;
the regional focus on R&amp;D, there will be greater capacity to generate and test location-&#13;
specific technologies, package appropriate technologies, and transfer them to more farmers&#13;
and create diverse production systems. Stronger research-extension-farmer linkages will&#13;
ensure that technology is demand-driven and clients' needs and circumstances are the basis&#13;
for planning and design of R&amp;D projects. Improved linkages to policy-makers would&#13;
facilitate faster and wider application of new technology and ensure that the R&amp;D system&#13;
effectively supports national and sectoral objectives, through more responsive policies.&#13;
B. RisKs&#13;
5.2  In addition to the normal risks associated with any research undertaking, where&#13;
results can not be guaranteed, the main risks of the proposed project are associated with&#13;
unsatisfactory implementation of project actions in regionalizing the R&amp;D system due to:&#13;
(a)possible resistance to policy and institutional changes and continued institutional&#13;
weakness in carrying out the required reforms at the lower levels; (b) scientists and&#13;
technical support staff may not agree to move to regions and provinces and less developed&#13;
areas, which was apparent in the implementation of the ongoing ARM Project;&#13;
(c) resistance by provincial agencies to provide their full support and participation to a&#13;
regional R&amp;D system, especially where AARD capacity is low; and (d) continued&#13;
inadequate funding for O&amp;M expenditures. The latter could become a major risk if funds&#13;
from domestic and other sources would not be available during the project period and&#13;
beyond to increase the current research funding level and would threaten the sustainability&#13;
of the R&amp;D system.&#13;
5.3   The Project includes a number of actions to minimize the above risks. In the first&#13;
place, there is a strong focus on human resource development through the provision of&#13;
training and technical assistance to overcome present institutional weakness, particularly at&#13;
regional level, in implementing the required administrative and management reforms and&#13;
implement the new R&amp;D programs. At the national level, GOI and MOA appear to be&#13;
strongly committed to institutional change and regionalization of applied research activities.&#13;
With the increasing regional institutional capability as a result of the Project, it can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
expected that policy and institutional changes will be phased in over a reasonable time&#13;
frame.&#13;
5.4    At the regional level also, the increased role of provincial and local authorities, as&#13;
well as farmers' groups and other stakeholders in planning and decision making in&#13;
determining the R&amp;D programs will give them increasing ownership of the more locally&#13;
relevant R&amp;D outputs. AARD has initiated a number of workshops and discussions at&#13;
provincial level to fully familiarize local authorities and institutions with details of the&#13;
intended regionalization of agricultural research and will continue this process as the&#13;
network of AIATs expands. Response at provincial and local level has been strong so far.&#13;
Some provinces are already providing funds for local research and others have pledged to&#13;
contribute when research is implemented in their area. Since the provinces have limited&#13;
revenue raising capacity, their contributions are and will remain small for some time to&#13;
come in relation to the national funds provided for this purpose. Sustainability of project&#13;
activities will, therefore, depend on continued strong national funding through AARD and&#13;
donor assistance. GOI has planned a significant increase in research funding during Repelita&#13;
VI. An assurance has been obtained under the Project that GOI will increase funding for&#13;
agricultural research by a minimum of 3 percent annually, in real terms, over the six-year&#13;
project period. The major incentives to attract staff to the regions will be the deflection of&#13;
considerably larger budgetary resources to the new regional R&amp;D network and the&#13;
increased provision of training opportunities for regional staff. Other incentive schemes are&#13;
also under consideration as explained in para. 4.27.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   The following actions are required to assure the successful implementation of the&#13;
project and attainment of its major objectives.&#13;
6.2   During negotiations the following assurances were obtained from Government:&#13;
(a)   Key AIAT staff would be appointed by October 1, 1995 (para. 4.7);&#13;
(b)   Regional Advisory Comnmittees and Regional Technical Working Groups&#13;

(c)   Detailed designs, cost estimates, draft tender documents for the&#13;
construction/rehabilitation of buildings and procurement of equipment for&#13;
the four AIATs in Phase II would be prepared by March 31, 1996&#13;
(para. 4.27);&#13;
(d)   GOI would continue to increase AARD's total R&amp;D allocation by a&#13;
minimum of 3 percent per anmum, in real terms, to ensure adequate funding&#13;
for the AIAT network as well as for the existing national research network&#13;
(para. 4.5);&#13;
(e)   GOI would maintain levels of total operational funding for all activities&#13;
financed under the project at or above those projected in this Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report by increasing GOI funding as Loan financing for&#13;
incremental operating costs are scaled back in accordance with the&#13;
schedule in para. 4.4;&#13;
(f)    Annual work programs and detailed budgets, approved by the Regional&#13;
Advisory Committees and processed in accordance with GOI procedures,&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank by December 31 each year (para. 4.6);&#13;
(g)   Arrangements would be made for technical audits of project activities, on a&#13;
sample basis, by the Inspectorate General of Agriculture. Each AIAT and&#13;
Components 3 and 4 would be covered at least twice during the project&#13;
period and the technical audit reports submitted annually by July 31, to the&#13;
Bank for review and comment (para. 4.25);&#13;
(h)   Monitoring and evaluation reports on physical and financial project&#13;
progress based on agreed performance indicators would be submitted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
the Bank semi-annually by the Project Management Unit to coincide, as&#13;
much as possible, with Bank supervision missions (para. 4.25);&#13;
(i)    The first five subprojects considered under the University Research Grant&#13;
will be provided to the Bank for review before final approval by the&#13;
Research Grant Board (para. 3.15);&#13;
(j)    The Borrower shall procure vehicles according to a schedule acceptable to&#13;
the Bank (para. 4.12);&#13;
(k)   A joint mid-term evaluation will be undertaken about September 30, 1998&#13;
to assess the progress of the Project (para. 4.25).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
6.3   Subject to the above, the proposed project provides a suitable basis for a loan of&#13;
US$63.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia.&#13;

INIRODUCrION&#13;
This Project Inplementation Plan (PIP) was prepared during pre-appraisal and agreed&#13;
with the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD), the Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(MOA) and the Agency for National Development Planning (BAPPENAS). The PIP is based on&#13;
findings of the Bank's pre-appraisal and appraisal missions and consists of the five volume Project&#13;
Operational Manual (POM) which was prepared by AARD in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
provided by the Bank. The POM provides the detailed description of how the Project will be&#13;
implemented. A copy of the POM is available in the project files. This annex, therefore, provides&#13;
only a summary description of the project objectives, project components and subcomponents,&#13;
and implementation arrangements.&#13;
1. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PRoJEcr OBJECrVEs&#13;
1.1   The overall aim of the ARM II Project is to strengthen regional agricultural research and&#13;
development (R&amp;D), based on local human and natural resources, by colUaboratively developing&#13;
and transferring location-specific technology to support agaro-business and agro-industry&#13;
development which is market-oriented and client-driven. Specifically, the objectives of the&#13;
Project are:&#13;
(a)   to establish and operate eight priority regional Assessment Institutes of&#13;
Agricultural Technology (AIATs) covering 12 provinces, as AARD's regional&#13;
centers for firming systems research and technology transfer;&#13;
(b)   to introduce R&amp;D management reforms at the regional level to ensure relevance of&#13;
R&amp;D to the needs of farmers and other end-users and to improve its quality and&#13;
cost-effectiveness;&#13;

R&amp;D programs;&#13;
(d)   to improve Indonesia's access to internationally generated technologies and expand&#13;
the horizon of its scientists by improving collaboration with national agencies and&#13;
Asia-Pacific and international research centers and other national agricultural&#13;
research systems.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.2   The ARM  II Project will provide civil works, vehicles including boats, scientific&#13;
equipment (including computer hardware and software), office equipment, furniture, fellowships,&#13;
study tours, training, technical assistance, and incremental operating costs for research, research&#13;
management, operations and maintenance, and technology transfer. The total cost of the Project&#13;
is US$101.8 million, of which US$63.0 million equivalent will be financed by the Bank. The&#13;
Project will be implemented over six years in two overlapping five-year phases by AARD and its&#13;
Work Units, in collaboration with regional and provincial agencies. The Project has four&#13;
components:&#13;
1 .    Regionalization of Agricultural R&amp;D&#13;
2.   Institutionalization of R&amp;D Management at the Regional Level&#13;
3.    Priority Commodity and Discipline-Oriented Research Programs&#13;
4.    Strengthening R&amp;D Collaboration&#13;
2. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR TiE PROJECT&#13;
2.1   The Project will be implemented by AARD and its work units at two levels: (a) at the&#13;
regional level by a network of 17 AIATs and the Center for Agricultural Socio-Economic&#13;
Research (CASER), and (b) by the commodity research institutes and centers, the AARD&#13;
Secretariat, and the Center for Agricultural Research Programming (CARP). At the regional&#13;
level, implementation will be through the AIATs, the new AARD Work Units, in collaboration&#13;
with local universities, the Directorates General under the MOA, DINAS, planners and&#13;
policymakers, the extension service, farmers' groups, the private sector, and community and&#13;
locally-based organizations. To ensure broad participation in each region, a Regional Advisory&#13;
Committee, supported by a Regional Technical Working Group, will provide guidance to the&#13;
AIATs on the R&amp;D agenda, technology and information dissemination, collaborative activities,&#13;
training, and technical assistance. Farmers and other stakeholders will be well represented in&#13;
these regional bodies. CASER will coordinate the regional activities of the 17 AIATs, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                               ANNEX1&#13;
Components 1 and 2. At the national level, commodity research institutes will backstop the&#13;
AIATs in generating appropriate technology components based on the specific requirements of&#13;
the local production systems. The AARD Secretariat and CARP will provide overall coordination&#13;
of project activities, including those of Components 3 and 4. A National Advisory Committee&#13;
will provide guidance to the AARD Director General on ARM II Project matters.&#13;
2.2   A national Project Management and regional Implementing Units will utilize existing&#13;
structures and procedures of the agencies which they reside to carry out project operations,&#13;
including fund releases, accounting, auditing, and technical audit. Two types of project units will&#13;
be established: (a) a national Project Management Unit (PMU), under the AARD Secretariat (for&#13;
financial aspects) and CARP (for management aspects), which will coordinate project-wide&#13;
activities including Components 3 and 4 activities, and (b) a small Project Implementing Unit&#13;
(PIU), which will be located in each of the eight priority AIATs, to coordinate implementation of&#13;
Components I and 2.&#13;
B. AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTATION AGENCIES&#13;
2.3   The Borrower is the Republic of Indonesia (GOI) represented by AARD, the national&#13;
agricultural R&amp;D agency under MOA. AARD Work Units will implement the Project in&#13;
collaboration with relevant national, regional, and provincial agencies. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained from the MOA and AARD management to ensure adequate funding for the AIAT&#13;
network in addition to the existing national research network. GOI will continue to increase&#13;
R&amp;D operational expenditures by a minimum of 3 percent per annum, in real terms (as in the&#13;
ARM Project). Funding will be based on the project financing plan and will be made available in a&#13;
timely manner. Necessary steps will be taken to expedite the procurement procedures related to&#13;
major civil works and equipment. R&amp;D operational costs for the AIATs will be financed from the&#13;
Loan on a sliding scale; as the Loan contributions decrease, GOI would maintain levels of&#13;
operational expenditures at or above those projected in the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
C. RESPONSIBILrriIES OF IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
2.4   Agency for Agricultural Research and Development.  Overall responsibility for&#13;
coordination and implementation will rest with the AARD, with headquarters in Jakarta. The&#13;
AARD is headed by a Director General. As a result of the regionalization of the agricultural&#13;
research system (Chart 1), action has been taken to reorient the mandates of existing 16&#13;
commodity research institutes as follows: (a) five in Food Crops (Food Crops Biotechnology in&#13;
Bogor, Rice in Sukamandi, Legumes and Tuber Crops in Malang, Maize and Cereals in Maros,&#13;
Food Crops in Swampy Areas in Banjarbaru); (b) three in Horticulture (Ornamental Plants in&#13;
Jakarta, Vegetables in Lembang, Fruit Crops in Solok); (c) three for Industrial Crops (Spices and&#13;
Medicinal Plants in Bogor, Tobacco and Fiber Crops in Malang, Coconut and Palms in Manado);&#13;
(d) two in Livestock (Livestock Production in Ciawi, Animal Diseases in Bogor); and (e) three in&#13;
Fisheries (Fresh Water Fisheries in Sukamandi, Marine Fisheries in Jakarta, Coastal Fisheries in&#13;
Maros).&#13;

H. ADMINISTRATivE ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.18 The Project will be implemented at two levels. At the national level, the PMU Director&#13;
will be responsible for carrying out all necessary administrative arrangement recommended by&#13;
relevant AARD Work Units and approved by the National Advisory Committee. At the regional&#13;
level the PIU Coordinator will carry out all activities recommended by the AIAT Director and&#13;
approved by the Regional Advisory Committee. Full-time attention of relevant senior officials&#13;
will be required in development and implementation of new administrative, financial, and&#13;
management systems.&#13;
3. PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS&#13;
A. DETAILED FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.1   The proposed Bank loan of US$63.0 million equivalent will finance 62 percent of the total&#13;
project costs, comprising 93 percent of foreign exchange cost (US$22.3 million), 55 percent of&#13;
local cost, excluding taxes (US$40.7 million). GOI will finance the balance of project costs&#13;
(about USS38.8 million), including duties and taxes which are estimated at US$3.8 million&#13;
equivalent. The Bank will finance 70 percent of Civil Works including some construction of new&#13;
buildings, where necessary at the AIAT headquarters to accommodate transferred staff but also&#13;
for the rehabilitation and expansion of existing buildings where appropriate; 80 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52 -                                ANNEX 1&#13;
total value of Furniture and Equipment (including computers), Books and Journals (details in&#13;
para. D3.7); 100 percent of Overseas Training; 75 percent of Local Training; 80 percent of&#13;
Foreign and Local Technical Assistance; 80 percent of Research Collaboration; 75 percent of&#13;
University Research Grants; 80 percent of Scientists/Managers Exchange Programs; and 50&#13;
percent of Incremental Operating Costs (including Research Management, Operations and&#13;
Maintenance, Research Operations, and Technology Transfer Costs) based on a decreasing scale&#13;
of funding starting at 60 percent in Year 1 and falling to 40 percent in Year 5 for the remainder&#13;
of the project implementation period. GOI would finance 30 percent of Civil Works; 20 percent of&#13;
Furniture, Equipment, Books and Journals; 100 percent of Vehicles; 25 percent of Local Training;&#13;
20 percent of Foreign and Technical Assistance; 20 percent of Research Collaboration; 25 percent&#13;
of University Research Grants; 20 percent of Scientists/Managers Exchange Program; 50 percent&#13;
of Incremental Operating Costs based on an increasing level of funding over the project period,&#13;
and all Taxes and Duties based on the current 10 percent value added on contracts for Civil&#13;
Works, Furniture, Equipment and other goods and materials. All AARD's non-incremental costs&#13;
(including staff salaries) would be financed by GOI. GOI would continue to increase R&amp;D&#13;
operational expenditures by a minimum of 3 percent per annum, in real terms, to ensure adequate&#13;
funding of the AIAT network in addition to the existing national research network.  As&#13;
approximately 70 percent of project costs will be incurred at the regional level, funding from GOI&#13;
will flow directly through the provincial PIMBAGPRO, to the AIATs based on budgets which&#13;
will be agreed and approved by the respective Regional Advisory Committees. Any funds&#13;
provided by provincial governments to assist in the financing of AIAT operations will be&#13;
considered part of the counterpart funds provided by GOI. The financing plan is shown in Table&#13;

3.2    Total project costs amount to about US$101.8 million.  Total base costs amount to&#13;
US$86.7 million apportioned approximately between (a) Investment Costs (49 percent)&#13;
comprising Civil Works; Equipment, Fumiture, Computers, Books and Joumals; Vehicles and&#13;
Boats; Training; Technical Assistance, Research Collaboration; Scientists/Managers Exchange&#13;
Program, and a University Research Grant; and (b) Incremental Operating Costs (51 percent)&#13;
comprising Research Management Costs; Operating and Maintenance Costs; Research Operations&#13;
Costs; and Technology Transfer Costs. Overall, it is estimated that 70 percent of total base costs&#13;
will be incurred at the regional level mainly to support the eight priority AIATs and 30 percent of&#13;
the costs will be incurred at the national level. Project costs are planned to be incurred in two&#13;
phases, each of five years duration, covering a period of six years.&#13;
3.3    The estimated project cost by expenditure category is shown in Table 2 below. Project&#13;
costs by project subcomponent are shown in Table 3. Details of project costs by expenditure and&#13;
major components are shown in Table 4 and by subcomponents in Appendix 1 of Annex 1.&#13;

3.4    Bases of Cost Estimates. Project Costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. Cost estimates were based on a review of actual costs updated to&#13;
April 1995 (date of negotiations) with adjustments for local and foreign inflation&#13;
over the project period in accordance with Bank guidelines. Additional cost&#13;
information was derived from: (a) GOI's updated standard cost guidelines for&#13;
construction and refurbishment of civil works; (b) recent quotations from suppliers&#13;
for equipment (including computers) furniture, boats and vehicles; (c) costs of&#13;
foreign and local training and consultant services currently charged by local,&#13;
European and North American consultants and training programs; (d) incremental&#13;
recurrent costs, all aspects of which were exhaustively reviewed by the pre-&#13;
appraisal and appraisal missions and have been arrived at using research operation&#13;
costs derived from AARD's guidelines for estimating research costs based on the&#13;
experience of the ARM Project. Estimates for other costs under the headings of&#13;
research management, operations and maintenance, and technology transfer are&#13;
also based on AARD's ARM Project experience and have been revised and&#13;

modified where appropriate by the appraisal mission. As the cost of some&#13;
activities under the project (e.g., unit costs of laboratory equipment, workshops,&#13;
meetings with farmers) are comprised of numerous items of expenditure, it was&#13;
deemed appropriate to aggregate these costs into lump sums where necessary to&#13;
facilitate the processing of the detailed project cost tables. Where costs have been&#13;
aggregated, the composition of the lump sums shown in the cost tables may be&#13;
found in working papers entitled " Notes to COSTAB" in the project files. Project&#13;
costs have been converted into US dollars at the exchange rate of&#13;
Rp 2,193tUSS1.00.&#13;
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for unforeseen&#13;
physical variations (US$4.6 million) equivalent to 10 percent of the base cost of&#13;
Civil Works and 5 percent for all other items, with the exception of&#13;
Scientists/Managers Exchange Program and Books and Journals. The following&#13;
rates were used to cover expected price escalation over the 6 year project period&#13;
from  1996-2001: local costs 5.0 percent; foreign costs 2.2 percent.  Price&#13;
contingencies amount to US$10.5 million over the project implementation period.&#13;
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
about US$23.9 million including contingencies, or 23 percent of total project cost.&#13;
Calculations of the foreign exchange component were derived from an item by&#13;
item analysis resulting in the following: 30 percent for Civil Works; 60 percent for&#13;
Equipment; 55 percent for Vehicles; and 100 percent for Foreign Training and&#13;
Technical Assistance; 60 percent for Research Collaboration; 60 percent for&#13;
University Research Grants; 75 percent for Scientists/Managers Exchange&#13;
Program; and 100 percent for Books and Journals.&#13;
(d)   Customs Duties and Taxes. Taxes and duties, which will be financed by GOI,&#13;
are estimated at US$3.8 million based on the current 10 percent value added tax&#13;
on all contracts for Civil Works, Equipment, and other goods and materials.&#13;
3.5   Incremental Operating Costs.  Included in the project costs are about US$53.1 million&#13;
to cover incremental operating costs directly attributable to the project over the 6 year project&#13;
period.  These consist of Incremental Research Management Costs connected with the&#13;
decentralization of research management to the regions, Operations and Maintenance Costs for&#13;
newly constructed civil works and items of equipment acquired under the Project, Research&#13;
Operating Costs for research being undertaken in priority research areas, and Technology&#13;
Transfer Costs to disseminate research results to farmers. During the Project duration, AARD&#13;
will pay extra attention to monitoring the adequacy of recurrent finds for maintenance and&#13;
operation of facilities and newly instituted programs, and take necessary actions to rectify any&#13;
deficiencies. To monitor operating expenditure, AARD will collect and report, on a yearly basis,&#13;
all incremental and non-incremental operating expenditure incurred under specific cost headings&#13;
to assist in monitoring input and output indicators. (Appendix 1 in Annex I provides the format&#13;
for reporting).&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENT AND FINANCING SCHEDULES&#13;
3.6   Disbursements. The Project is expected to be completed by October 1, 2001. The Bank&#13;
Loan of US$63.0 million equivalent will be disbursed over the six year project implementation&#13;
period, and is expected to be completed by April 30, 2001, the Loan Closing Date. This profile is&#13;
consistent with the strong implementation capacity of AARD as demonstrated during the&#13;
implementation of the ARM Project. This forecast takes into account the complexity of the&#13;
Project, the decentralization of the research management function to the regions, and the&#13;
capabilities of the accounting/finance function within AARD. Disbursements for FY1995/96 are&#13;
based on the initial deposit into the Special Account and replenishments. A summary of the&#13;
disbursement plan is shown in Table 7.&#13;

individuals US$50,000. For all expenditure in those categories below the limits specified and for&#13;
expenditure on training, research collaboration, university research grants, scientists/managers&#13;
exchange program, and incremental operating costs, disbursements will be made on the basis of&#13;
certified Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). This documentation will be available for the required&#13;
audit and also to Bank supervision missions, and will be retained by the PMU for at least one year&#13;
after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.&#13;
3.9   Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government will establish a&#13;
Special Account in the amount of US$3.5 million in Bank Indonesia, or at a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. This account should be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget,&#13;
MOF. The Special Account would be used for all eligible foreign and local expenditures under all&#13;
categories. Replenishment to the Special Account will be made on a monthly basis, or when&#13;
20 percent of the initial deposit has been used on the basis of replenishment requests with&#13;
supporting documents satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
E. AccouNTs AND AuDrrs&#13;
3.10  Accounting and auditing arrangements under the Project will be similar to those&#13;
established under the ARM Project (Loan 3031-IND). To facilitate the audit of the project&#13;
accounts, AARD will collect and consolidate the account records of a8l project expenditure into a&#13;
single document in a format agreed with the Bank (Appendix 1). Assurances were obtained from&#13;
AARD during negotiations that: (a) all project accounts, including schedules of expenditure&#13;
claimed under SOE procedures and usage of the Special Account will be audited annually by the&#13;
Government Audit Agency (BPKP), or other suitably qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
and (b) audit reports of project accounts, SOE, and Special Account will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank within six months of each Government fiscal year.&#13;
3.11 Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PMU will prepare semi-annual descriptive and&#13;
financial reports on each project component, objective, and activity (beginning from the date of&#13;
Loan Effectiveness). Information on the regional components (Components 1 and 2) will be&#13;
provided by the PrU Coordinators through quarterly reports to be submitted to the AARD&#13;
Director General, with copies to the PMU Director, relevant AARD Work Units, and the Bank.&#13;
The reports will describe: (a) current status and achievements of the Project; (b) problems met&#13;
&#13;

and deviations, if any, from the implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and&#13;
corrective actions being taken. The progress reporting format and procedure followed in the&#13;
ARM Project will be used with modifications, as needed. Reporting and Bank supervision will&#13;
focus on in-depth reviews of the: (i) policy framework for sectoral improvements; (ii) the&#13;
consistency of activities for each component and subcomponent with agreements reached at&#13;
negotiations, (iii) performance of the implementing groups and institutions; (iv) assessment of&#13;
emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters; and (v) possible follow-up operations&#13;
which could be supported by the Bank. Bank supervision will be based on the semi-annual&#13;
progress reports and the annual evaluation of project activities by the AARD. This will be&#13;
supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of financial resources, in&#13;
addition to substantive discussions with technical assistance groups implementing and/or assisting&#13;
in the implementation of various activities, and discussions with responsible Government&#13;
authorities. The PIP will be the basis for supervision and reporting.&#13;
4. DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. DETALED PROJECT ACrIVITIES&#13;
4.1   Detailed activities under each component and subcomponent are summarized in this&#13;
section. Detailed information is available in the Project Operational Manual prepared by an&#13;
AARD Project Preparation Team, under the guidance of the AARD Director General.&#13;
Implementation schedules for each component and subcomponent are given in Appendix 2 of the&#13;
PIP (Annex 1).&#13;
(a)   Regionalization of Agricultural R&amp;D&#13;
(i)   Establishment and operation of eight priority AJATs. The eight priority&#13;
AIATs to be supported by the Project, including the provinces which they&#13;
will cover, are as follows: for Phase I (beginning Year 1) - (a) AIAT&#13;
Ambon (Maluku), (b) AIAT Gedong Johor (North Sumatra), (c) AIAT&#13;
Kendari (South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi), (d) AIAT Biromaru&#13;
(Central Sulawesi and North Sulawesi), and for Phase II (beginning Year&#13;
2) - (e) AIAT Banda Aceh (DI Aceh), (f) AIAT Padang Marpoyan (Riau&#13;
and Jambi), (g) AIAT Pontianak (West Kalimantan), and (h) AIAT&#13;
Ungaran (Central Java and DI Yogyakarta). The other nine AIATs,&#13;
including AIAT Naibonat (West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara and&#13;
East Timor) under the Bank-supported proposed Nusa Tenggara Regional&#13;
Agricultural Development Project, will be supported by GOI with&#13;
assistance from other donors. The activities include the organization a&#13;
Regional Advisory Committee and a Regional Technical Working Group&#13;
for each AIAT. In cases of two- or three-province AIATs, there will be one&#13;
committee and working group in each province. AARD will assign a full&#13;
complement of staff in each AIAT, based on the needs of the regional R&amp;D&#13;
&#13;

program, by reassignment, relocation, limited recruitment, and retraining of&#13;
staff.&#13;
The physical facilities of the former Agricultural Information Centers,&#13;
which were recently transferred to AARD, and AARD's substations and&#13;
experimental farms, will be upgraded for used by the AIATs. Existing&#13;
facilities will be rehabilitated and selected new facilities will be constructed,&#13;
based on the specific needs of each AIAT, as follows: (a) offices for&#13;
researchers, extension workers, and administrative staff, (b) facilities for&#13;
production of multi-media materials; (c) soil preparation facility; (d) seed&#13;
preparation and storage facility; (e) basic crops, fisheries and livestock&#13;
research laboratories; (f) additional staff housing; (g) postharvest and&#13;
processing facility; and (h) library. Furniture and equipment, including&#13;
computers, will be procured to make these facilities operational. In&#13;
addition, vehicles such as cars, boats, and motorcycles, will be procured&#13;
through the Project.&#13;
Using strategic planning and programming methods and tools developed&#13;
under the ARM Project, and with assistance from short-term consultants,&#13;
each AIAT will develop a regional R&amp;D master plan, including R&amp;D&#13;
priorities, resource requirements, staffing requirements, priority R&amp;D&#13;
program and budget; and responsible agencies. A peer review process and&#13;
criteria for evaluation will be introduced for approving proposals and for&#13;
determining achievements and impact of project interventions. As new&#13;
AARD Work Units, the AMATs capability to carry out R&amp;D and&#13;
management activities will have to be strengthened considerably.&#13;
Fellowships, short-term training on technical, social sciences, and&#13;
management topics, and short-term technical assistance will be provided to&#13;
assist the AIAT staff. To give incentives for researchers and managers to&#13;
move to more isolated AIATs to work on farm-level activities, the current&#13;
incentive system will be reviewed and AARD will introduce innovative&#13;
methods of rewarding excellence in R&amp;D and management. AARD will&#13;
also consider gender equity in recruitment, promotion, career advancement,&#13;
priority for staff training, and other personnel matters.&#13;
(ii)    Characterization of AEZs as basis for planning in eight priority&#13;
regions. The various AEZs in Indonesia have been characterized for&#13;
different purposes, such as for provincial development planning. Under this&#13;
subcomponent, existing AEZ characteristics will be refined by gathering&#13;
additional data through diagnostic surveys, rapid rural appraisal, and&#13;
analyzing and interpreting information for R&amp;D planning. In addition to&#13;
physical characteristics of the regions, information on the economic, social,&#13;
and cultural aspects, including the role of men, women, youth, and distinct&#13;
cultural groups whose production is primarily subsistence-oriented. Their&#13;
roles in households and in the agricultural production systems, which will&#13;
be used as basis for incorporating these agreed concems in project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
activities. Potential effect of research output, to the environment, will be&#13;
gathered. AEZ data bases will be developed to computerize, compile,&#13;
analyze, interpret, and maintain the regional databases to facilitate the&#13;
utilization of information by various user groups, such as local planners&#13;
and policymakers, researchers, extension workers, and other development&#13;
workers.&#13;
(iii)    Support for regional R&amp;D program. The regional R&amp;D program will&#13;
focus on the important constraints and technology needs of the major&#13;
production systems in the regions covered by AIATs. The AIAT staffs'&#13;
capability in farming systems methodology, data analysis and interpretation,&#13;
policy formulation, social analysis, gender analysis, and technology transfer&#13;
methodology, will be improved. Constraints and available technology will&#13;
be matched and tested in collaboration with farmers, DINAS, and&#13;
extension workers. Emphasis will be on testing and verification of&#13;
component technologies on farmers' fields, including focusing on the&#13;
specific needs of special groups like women, youth, and distinct cultural&#13;
groups whose production is primarily subsistence-oriented. The best&#13;
technologies will be integrated with current farming practices and tested&#13;
using farming systems approach. Technology menus will be developed for&#13;
further on-farm testing and upscaling. Special studies will be carried out,&#13;
with assistance from specialists (under TA) on topics such as role of men&#13;
and women in the household and in the farming systems, cultural issues,&#13;
assessment of extension impact, and analysis of farner adoption rates, in&#13;
collaboration with local universities (under the University Research Grant).&#13;
(iv)   Support for regional technology transfer program. This subcomponent&#13;
will promote the utilization of integrated technologies developed for use in&#13;
specific major fanning systems. The skills of farmers and extension workers&#13;
on the application of new technologies will be increased by organizing on-&#13;
farm demonstrations of best technologies and field days to provide&#13;
participatory evaluation and promote technology utilization. Upscaling and&#13;
piloting selected technologies will be carried out with the DINAS and&#13;
extension workers involving many more farmers to enhance farmers'&#13;
adoption. Social, cultural, and gender-related concerns will be integrated in&#13;
project activities, especially in areas traditionally the prerogative of women&#13;
such as fruit and vegetable processing, fish handling and marketing, home&#13;
gardens, etc. To facilitate technology transfer, farmer-oriented publications&#13;
and audio-visual support materials, will be produced for farm-level&#13;
information dissemination. Farmers will be exposed to new agricultural&#13;
development activities elsewhere through their participation in regional&#13;
fora, farmers' meetings, and farmer-to-farmer visits. Other well-targeted&#13;
publications will also be prepared for public awareness-building on research&#13;
outputs and impact. Based on feedback from farmers and other users, the&#13;
regional MIS databases will be updated periodically. Other stakeholders,&#13;
such as policymakers, community and locally-based organizations, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                              ANNEX 1&#13;
private sector, and special groups such as women, youth, and distinct&#13;
cultural groups whose production is subsistence-oriented, will be&#13;
encouraged to participate in regional fora, workshops, and other&#13;
technology promotion activities.&#13;
(b)  Institutionalization of R&amp;D Management&#13;
(i)   Strengthening R&amp;D planning, priority setting, policy formulation,&#13;
MIS, monitoring and evaluation. As the GOIL with possible assistance&#13;
from other donors, will establish and operate the remaining nine AIATs in&#13;
the network, the Project will assist GOI by introducing administrative and&#13;
management reforms, developed under the ARM Project, to the regional&#13;
level. The remaining nine AIATs and relevant provinces include: AIAT&#13;
Karangploso (East Java and Bali), AIAT Koya Barat (Irian Jaya), AIAT&#13;
Lembang (West Java and DKI Jakarta), AIAT Natar (Lampung), AIAT&#13;
Naibonat (East Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor),&#13;
AIAT Palang Karaya (Central Kalimantan and South Kalimanatan), AIAT&#13;
Puntikayu (South Sumatra), AIAT Samarinda (East Kalimantan), and&#13;
AIAT Sukarami (West Sumatra and Bengkulu). Regional planning,&#13;
priority setting, policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation, including&#13;
impact assessment methodologies, social analysis, gender analysis, and use&#13;
of backstopping and feedback mechanisms, will be introduced to the 17&#13;
AIATs in the network. The skills of AMAT staff and the staff of&#13;
collaborating institutions will be improved by training on appropriate&#13;
management processes, procedures, and tools with assistance from&#13;
consultants. The Project will support expenditures for putting these&#13;
administrative and management procedures in the 17 AIATs in the&#13;
network.&#13;
Using initial experience in Phase I of the Project, the AEZs and regional&#13;
R&amp;D master plans in the remaining nine regions not covered in Component&#13;
1 wil be completed. The annual review of R&amp;D activities and regional&#13;
planning will be undertaken in all 17 AIATs each year. A peer review of&#13;
R&amp;D proposals and of research outputs will be undertaken at regional&#13;
venues. To facilitate information dissemination and provide feedback to&#13;
researchers, a regional forum will be established as a regular means of&#13;
consulting relevant stakeholder, especially farmers, extension workers,&#13;
local entrepreneurs, the private sector, and community and locally-based&#13;
organizations.&#13;
(ii)    Strengthening  national communication  and  scientific literature&#13;
service. Under the leadership of CALREC, the national and regional&#13;
communication networks will be linked and the scientific literature service&#13;
at the regional level will be strengthened under the Project to improve&#13;
access to scientific information by AIAT staff. AARD Work Units will be&#13;
linked to IPTEKNET, an Indonesian consortium of government agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                              ANNEX 1&#13;
and universities for information exchange. Books and journals on&#13;
appropriate topics will be provided the AIATs and the existing library&#13;
facilities will be rehabilitated to provide better service to farmers,&#13;
researchers, extension workers, local university students, and other&#13;
development workers. Through CALREC, the linkages between the AARD&#13;
commodity research institutes and regional assessment institutes will be&#13;
strengthened to facilitate access to national and international databases.&#13;
Computers will be procured to establish this electronic communication&#13;
network within AARD Work Units that would provide access to e-mail&#13;
and file transfer services, and worldwide linkages through ITERNET.&#13;
Short-term technical assistance and staff training will be provided on&#13;
information networking, computer technology, data analysis and&#13;
interpretation, and database development and management. Preparation,&#13;
mass production, and distribution of multi-media materials will be major&#13;
activities at the regional level to support technology transfer.&#13;
(iii)    Establishment of national MIS and new government accounting and&#13;
rinancial and administrative systems in the regions. Under the ARM&#13;
Project, a national MIS was developed for project, financial, and personnel&#13;
management. Under this subcomponent, the MIS databases will be&#13;
streamlined to conform with AIAT needs and requirements by both&#13;
managers and researchers at the regional level. To improve the capability to&#13;
analyze and utilize information for planning and managing R&amp;D activities,&#13;
and policy formulation, the capability of AIAT staff will be improved by&#13;
sequenced and timely short-term and in-service training. Relevant AIAT&#13;
staff will also be trained on the New Government Accounting System&#13;
(NGAS), to be introduced to the AIATs during the project period. To&#13;
encourage AARD staff to move to the AIATs, especially those in more&#13;
remote locations, the current staff incentive system will be reviewed to&#13;
update the criteria for recruitment and promotion considering the new&#13;
mandates of the AIATs, different skill mixes required for implementing the&#13;
regional R&amp;D activities, and the addition of extension workers in the AIAT&#13;
staff complement. Innovations will be introduced to reward excellence in&#13;
R&amp;D and management. Among others, AARD will consider gender equity&#13;
in recruitment, promotion, career development, staff training, and other&#13;
personnel matters.&#13;
(iv)    Building regional research and technology transfer capability. As a&#13;
new AARD Work Unit, the capability of AMAT staff to manage integrated&#13;
R&amp;D programs using multidisciplinary and participatory approaches,&#13;
including farming systems methodology, will be very limited. The capability&#13;
of staff will be strengthened by providing degree and non-degree training&#13;
and short-term technical assistance in scientific fields, in strengthening&#13;
research-extension-farmer linkages, including the use of new methods, such&#13;
as community participation approaches. To assure sharing of information&#13;
and experiences across regions, a national/regional and regional/regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
scientists, managers, and extension workers exchange program will be&#13;
implemented to allow staff to move across organizations and provide them&#13;
with the necessary support and incentives.&#13;
(v)    Pilot regional soil fertility and fertilizer use program. The pilot soil&#13;
fertility and fertilizer use program will support the establishment of three&#13;
regional soil testing laboratories in Maros (South Sulawesi), Medan (North&#13;
Sumatra), and Yogyakarta (D.I. Yogyakarta) to serve the needs of farmers.&#13;
This facility will work with the soil sample collection and preparation&#13;
facilities at the AIATs under Component 1. Existing soil testing facilities at&#13;
the AARD research institutes in the three areas will be upgraded and&#13;
provided with special equipment to carry out analysis of a large number of&#13;
samples for routine soil analysis. In addition, the laboratory in Medan will&#13;
carry out plant tissue analysis. CSAR in Bogor will provide basic soils&#13;
analysis training, coordination of work in the AIATs and the regional soils&#13;
laboratories, and data storage. The Project will also provide travel and per&#13;
diem to CSAR staff to carry out coordination activities. In addition, short-&#13;
term technical assistance for the soil testing network and staff in-service-&#13;
skill building will be provided on soil and plant sampling and analysis,&#13;
technical data interpretation, and use of information. The Project will also&#13;
support fertilizer-crop response studies in both over-fertilized and under-&#13;
fertilized areas, including activities with universities under the University&#13;
Research Grant.&#13;
(vi)    Support for ARMP II Project Implementation. This subcomponent will&#13;
support the establishment and management of the national Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) and eight regional Project Implementing Units&#13;
(PIUs) which will be charged with daily operations of the Project. Office&#13;
facilities, furniture, equipment, and vehicles will be provided for the PMU&#13;
and PIU staff. AARD will assign full-time staff to support these units. The&#13;
Project will also provide support for the PMU to coordinate national level&#13;
activities (Component 3 and 4). In addition, support will be provided to&#13;
CARP, the AARD Secretariat, and CASER for overall coordination of&#13;
project activities.&#13;
(c)   Priority Commodity and Discipline-Oriented Research Program&#13;
(i)    Support for priority livestock research. Livestock research will focus on&#13;
increasing the productivity of the livestock subsector, especially in small&#13;
holder farming systems. Research will be implemented by the Research&#13;
Institute for Livestock Production (RELP) and the Research Institute for&#13;
Animal Diseases (RLAD), under the coordination of the Central Research&#13;
Institute for Animal Science (CRLAS). Research will focus on: (a) animal&#13;
feeding and nutrition emphasizing technologies for the Eastern Islands,&#13;

assistance. Joint activities with research units of the National Institute of&#13;
Sciences (LIPI) and the Agency for the Assessment and Application of&#13;
Technology (BPPT) will also be supported. The tuna stock assessment is&#13;
expected to be done through collaboration with the Philippines and a&#13;
specialized organization. This research study will include a lump sum&#13;
provision of funds for specialist support for training on methodology, data&#13;
gathering and analysis, monitoring of stocks, and formulation of a stock&#13;
management plan.&#13;
(iii)    Support for priority horticulture and tree crops research. This research&#13;
program  will diversify the selection of high value fruit, vegetable,&#13;
ornamental, fiber, medicinal, spices, oil-producing, and estate crops and&#13;
improve the quality and increase value added of products from these crops.&#13;
Research will be implemented by the following AARD research institutes:&#13;
(a) Central Research Institute for Horticulture (CRIH) for ornamental and&#13;
cut flowers; (b) Research Institute for Vegetables (RIV); (c) Research&#13;
Institute for Fruit Crops (RIFC); (d) Research Institute for Spices and&#13;
Medicinal Plants (RISMP); (e) Research Institute for Coconut and Palms&#13;
(RICP); and (f) the various estate crops research and development centers&#13;

(g) improvement of the quality of planting materials. The Project will&#13;
provide scientific equipment, furniture, vehicles, and technical assistance.&#13;
(v)    National human resource development program. This subcomponent is&#13;
a continuation of a similar program implemented under the ARM Project to&#13;
further improve the capability of AARD on selected more basic and applied&#13;
disciplines. Degree and non-degree training will emphasize special fields in&#13;
livestock, fisheries, horticulture, and tree crops research. Some selected&#13;
disciplines include (a) plant, livestock, and fish breeding; (b) biotechnology&#13;
in plant, livestock, fish and microorganisms; (c) fisheries; (d) economics,&#13;
sociology, and anthropology; (e) soil mapping and soil classification;&#13;
(f) agroprocessing; (g) management information systems; and (h) research&#13;
and extension management. The selection of staff who will undergo&#13;
training will follow the guidelines and criteria used under the ARM Project,&#13;
with modifications, as needed, but with special consideration to equity&#13;
among men and women staff and among national and regional staff.&#13;
Support for attendance to conferences, seminars, and workshops on&#13;
scientific topics and methodologies, both local and foreign, will also be&#13;
provided.&#13;
(vi)    National technical assistance and special studies. Considerable local&#13;
expertise has been built in AARD Work Units on technical and&#13;
management fields under the ARM Project. Hence, this component will&#13;
augment expertise within the relevant commodity research institutes on key&#13;
topics and to assist in carrying out special studies. Emphasis will be given&#13;
to fields where local expertise in AARD is still weak or lacking. Most of&#13;
the technical assistance will be short-term based on needs of specific&#13;
&#13;

areas in research management, sociology including cultural and gender&#13;
issues, development communication, extension education, and technology&#13;
transfer will also be included.&#13;
(d)   Strengthening R&amp;D Collaboration&#13;
(i)    Strengthening linkages to national agencies. This subcomponent will&#13;
tap the research expertise in universities and other R&amp;D institutes (i.e.,&#13;
under LIPI and BPPT) to backstop the needs of the AIATs in specific&#13;
regions. It will continue the competitive grant program started under the&#13;
ARM Project. Under the University Research Grant, universities and&#13;
AARD Work Units, will plan and implement joint projects on the high&#13;
priority areas identified in Components 1 and 3, but emphasizing topics of&#13;
regional importance. A twining arrangement will be tested whereby a&#13;
provincial university, a more developed university, and an AARD Work&#13;
Unit will plan, design, and implement joint projects. Support will be&#13;
provided by the Project to strengthen linkages with the private sector,&#13;
DINAS at the provincial and district levels, parastatals, community and&#13;
locally-based organizations, and other development projects, using&#13;
innovative ways of cost-sharing. A forum for regular consultation on R&amp;D&#13;
priorities, information and technology sharing, and discussion of policy&#13;
issues with stakeholders, will be established.&#13;
(ii)    Strengthening linkages to international and Asia-Pacific research&#13;
organizations. This subcomponent will improve Indonesia's access to&#13;
relevant technologies generated by international research centers (i.e.,&#13;
centers under the CGIAR) and enhance the exposure of Indonesian&#13;
scientists to the international research community, other NARS in the&#13;
region, and Asia-Pacific research centers. Special attention will be given to&#13;
R&amp;D activities which will support the ASEAN Growth Areas where&#13;
Indonesia is an active participant. Joint proposals will be prepared by&#13;
AARD Work Units in consultation with potential collaborating institutions&#13;
following the priorities established by the AIATs (Components 1 and 2)&#13;
and the commodity research institutes (Component 3) to ensure that&#13;
collaboration is demand-driven. Support for collaboration on the following&#13;
areas will be provided: (a) joint research, (b) hands-on training,&#13;
(c) technical assistance, (d) information sharing; (e) publication in&#13;
intemationally refereed joumals; (f) attendance to intemational and regional&#13;
scientific fora to participate and present papers; and (g) conduct or joint&#13;
sponsorship of intemational or regional fora (conferences, seminars, and&#13;
workshops) to be held in Indonesia. The Project will also support an&#13;
exchange program for scientists and managers of AARD Work Units and&#13;
staff of international agricultural research centers, selected foreign&#13;
universities, Asia-Pacific national agricultural research systems and&#13;
research centers.&#13;

B. LMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.2   Appendix 2 of Annex 1 includes the detailed schedule of implementation by component,&#13;
subcomponent, and activity. The schedule takes into account the work to be carried out to&#13;
complete project preparation and reflects the detailed implementation activities. Based on the&#13;
quality of the work already completed, it is planned that some implementation activities will start&#13;
prior to the Project's Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
A. PROJECT INDICATORS&#13;
5.1   Input Indicators will track planned investments in terms of contracted technical&#13;
assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-months) in training programs, procurement&#13;
of civil works and goods, and research, management, and technology transfer activities. These&#13;
indicators will be presented in standard input tables for each component and major subcomponent&#13;
of the Project to be developed by AARD.&#13;
5.2   Output Indicators will track items such as the number and type of technology or&#13;
technology packages generated, tested, and verified by AIATs and farmers; rate of diffusion of&#13;
these technologies; improved research management procedures and tools introduced; R&amp;D&#13;
priorities established and effect on allocation of R&amp;D funds; number of training, workshop, field&#13;
days, and on-farm demonstrations held and persons who participated; the number and outcome of&#13;
R&amp;D activities that have been completed by a given date during the project cycle; number and&#13;
type of facilities rehabilitated or constructed; and number and type of equipment, journals, and&#13;
books procured. These indicators will be tracked in standard output tables for each component&#13;
and major subcomponent of the Project to be developed by AARD.&#13;
5.3  In an effort to track Government expenditures in agricultural research, including those&#13;
from provincial sources, the Government has agreed that the AARD would collect and report, on&#13;
a yearly basis, agricultural research expenditures, using existing methods, to assist in monitoring&#13;
input and output indicators.&#13;
B. DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS&#13;
5.4   Tracking key monitoring indicators is necessary to measure the effect of the project inputs&#13;
on the attainment of the major development objectives of the Project. Given the essential role that&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation play in determining the benefits or negative impact of a given&#13;
intervention on development objectives, three sets of indicators will be used to monitor and&#13;
evaluate progress during project implementation: (a) outcome indicators, (b) input indicators, and&#13;
(c) output indicators. Details of the performance indicators by components, subcomponents, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
evaluate progress during project implementation: (a) outcome indicators, (b) input indicators, and&#13;
(c) output indicators. Details of the performance indicators by components, subcomponents, and&#13;
activities are in the Notes on Performance Indicators in the Project Operational Manual in the&#13;
project files.&#13;
5.5    Outcome Indicators. These key performance indicators will track whether or not the&#13;
development objectives of the Project have been met. Two criteria were used to select the basic&#13;
outcome indicators: (a) that the indicator is known to be sensitive to the intervention introduced&#13;
under the Project; and (b) that the data will be available through periodic collection and analysis&#13;
of relevant information. It is difficult to measure the impact of an agricultural research project in&#13;
the short-term because of the long-term nature of R&amp;D activities and that technology is only one&#13;
of the contributing factors to success in agricultural development. Hence, during negotiations, it&#13;
was agreed that the following performance measures of the initial impact of agricultural R&amp;D&#13;
activities and management reforms will be used to determine the attainment of the development&#13;
objectives of the Project. Since most research activities (i.e., plant breeding) have long gestation&#13;
and the impact of research (i.e., adoption of a new variety by farmers) has equally long-term&#13;
effect, AARD will continue to track these indicators beyond the duration of the Project as one&#13;
aspect of overall monitoring of the impact of research on agricultural development. The following&#13;
is a list of the outcome indicators which will be tracked during Project implementation using&#13;
periodic survey sampling techniques. Baseline data were gathered for the 12 project provinces&#13;
(Provincial Profiles) and are included in the background project documents in project files. These&#13;
profiles will be refined during the AEZ characterization of the 17 regions and periodically updated&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
(a)   Impact of R&amp;D Outputs&#13;
(i)  Initial adoption level of recommended practices tested and disseminated by AIATs&#13;
and their collaborating institutions;&#13;
(ii)   Cost benefit of recommended technology packages disseminated to farmers by&#13;
AIATs;&#13;
(iii)   Rate of utilization by farmers, extension workers, and others of multimedia&#13;
materials produced and disseminated by AIATs;&#13;
(iv)   Rate of utilization of location-specific fertilizer recommendations by farmers;&#13;
(v)   Research outputs transferred from commodity research institutes to AIATs for&#13;
testing on farmer's fields;&#13;
(vi)   Research outputs from collaborative projects carried out by AARD Work Units&#13;
with Asia-Pacific and international agricultural research centers;&#13;
(vii)  Special activities, such as on-farm trials and demonstrations, focused on women,&#13;
youth groups, and distinct cultural groups, and their effects.&#13;

(iii) Changes in the staffing patterns of the AIATs by level of training, gender, and&#13;
hands-on experience; and&#13;
(iv)   Outputs from joint projects with universities, the private sector, Asia-Pacific, and&#13;
international research centers and level of funds provided.&#13;
(c)   Long-Term Impact of Agricultural R&amp;D&#13;
(i)  Improved fanning systems in terms of increased production, increased yield per&#13;
hectare, new crop varieties or animal breeds adopted by farmers, etc.;&#13;
(ii)  Rate of adoption of technology or technology packages by farmers, other users;&#13;
(iii)  Increased income of farmers and others;&#13;
(iv)  Improved R&amp;D capacity at the regional/provincial levels in terms of human&#13;
resources, R&amp;D facilities, etc.; and&#13;
(v)  Effect of technology on environment.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
SECOND AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE UNIVERSrrY RESEARCH GRANT&#13;
1.    Agriculture faculties of the universities in Indonesia are an important research&#13;
resource to provide technology needs of specific regions. Shortages of funds and facilities&#13;
restrict university research efforts and university staff spend more time in teaching and less&#13;
in research. Many universities welcome the opportunity to develop collaborative research&#13;
projects and to integrate these into the University Research Program, and the larger&#13;
overall national research effort.&#13;
2.    A research grant scheme for universities and other institutions has already been&#13;
established by AARD through the ARM Project. These grants are currently managed and&#13;
operated under a set of guidelines and criteria indicated below. The scheme is flexible and&#13;
permits a rapid response to training arrangements and participation of local universities in&#13;
emerging research topics of high priority which will not be possible through normal&#13;
government procedures. Under this grant scheme, universities currently conduct some&#13;
collaborative research projects with researchers in AARD's commodity research institutes.&#13;
3.    Under the ARM II Project, this university grant scheme will be expanded and&#13;
focused on the farming system needs of specific regions. The current scheme will be&#13;
revised to reflect changes in grant duration, institution eligibility and overall management&#13;
and introduce the concept of twinning, linking weaker universities with stronger ones.&#13;
Other criteria will remain unchanged, e.g., collaborative research projects must address&#13;
national development goals, productivity oriented, capable of being completed within a set&#13;
time-frame, under the direction of competent staff; etc. The participating universities will&#13;
be encouraged to fully support the priorities established under the Regional Research and&#13;
Development Program under the AIATs and to enter into joint projects with AARD's&#13;
commodity research institutes, AIATs, and international research centers.&#13;
Institution Eligibility&#13;
4.    Funds under the Project would be provided to AARD in trust for the universities&#13;
and only university departments will be eligible to participate in the University Research&#13;
Grant.&#13;
Collaborative Research Time Frame and Grant Limits&#13;
5.    The present arrangements for university research contracts used under the ARM&#13;
Project will be followed with some modifications, if needed. The time-frame for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
collaborative research projects will be extended to three years with fund release,&#13;
subsequent to the first year, subject to the receipt of both financial and technical annual&#13;
reports. The existing tranche system will remain in force for payments within any one&#13;
year. The upper limit for financial support will be the equivalent of US$20,000 annually,&#13;
but this could be varied after joint consideration by AARD and the Bank and in the light of&#13;
experience.&#13;
Eligible Expenditures&#13;
6.    University Research Grant funds will be used for field plot equipment, laboratory&#13;
equipment, reagents, agricultural chemicals, seeds, field labor, travel and allowances, and&#13;
overhead costs according to existing Government rules and regulations. They will not&#13;
normally be used for agricultural machinery, civil works or vehicles. Since it is assumed&#13;
that the proposed collaborative research project will be part of the university staff&#13;
member's normal work program, research grant funds will not be available for the&#13;
payment of supplements to salaries or consultancy fees. Where post-graduate students are&#13;
employed to work on the subproject, as part of their study program, fellowships will be&#13;
paid under the grant scheme at the rate determined by AARD. Procurement will be&#13;
according to Bank guidelines.&#13;
7.    The Research Grant Board established under the ARM Project, which is chaired by&#13;
the Director of CARP with membership of universities and the private sector, will be&#13;
responsible for screening research proposals submitted by universities. The Board will&#13;
meet at three monthly intervals and will be responsible for determining priorities between&#13;
different commodities and research disciplines. The Board will provide overall supervision&#13;
and policy guidance, and will be responsible for final approval of research proposals and&#13;
the allocation of funds between competing project proposals. The technical content of the&#13;
proposals will be assessed by the existing Commodity Research Groups which will provide&#13;
the Board with recommendations to support or reject the research proposals. Routine&#13;
administration and secretariat services to the Board will be provided by the Project&#13;
Management Unit. The Project will finance the cost of administration of the grant scheme&#13;
up to a limit of 15 percent of the value of grants made.&#13;
8.    Research proposals will be prepared according to the existing AARD standard&#13;
formats and agreements which will be based on the existing standard contracts (or&#13;
assignment memorandum) used under the ARM Project. These guidelines will define the&#13;
work program, responsibility for the research, reports to be provided, schedule for&#13;
reporting, approved budget and schedule and condition for payment. The University&#13;
Research Grant will be established in a separate account and will be replenished at&#13;
intervals according to disbursements made and the anticipated demand. It is estimated&#13;
that an initial deposit of US$200,000 equivalent will be needed.&#13;
9.    It was agreed during negotiations that proposals for the first five collaborative&#13;
research projects considered under the University Research Grant will be provided to the&#13;
Bank for review before final approval by the Research Grant Board.&#13;

            Indonesia - Second Agricultural Research
            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Second Agricultural Research
            Management Project will strengthen regional agricultural
            Research and Development (R&amp;D), based on local human and
            natural resources, by collaboratively developing and
            transferring location-specific technology which is
            market-oriented and client-driven to support agro-business
            and agro-industry development. This will be achieved through
            the establishment of a network of the regional Assessment
            Institute for Agricultural Technology (AIATS), improvement
            of regional research management, expansion of research in
            priority areas, and strengthened linkages to local,
            national, and international institutions, thereby
            facilitating the delivery of research results to end-users.
            Specific project outcomes for successfully meeting these
            objectives are included in the Project Implementation Plan.
            The project will consist of the following four components:
            (a) regionalization of agricultural R&amp;D; (b)
            institutionalization of R&amp;D management at the regional
            level; (c) support of priority commodity and
            discipline-oriented research; and (d) strengthen R&amp;D collaboration.
