WHERE CAPACITY IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM&#13;
Moving from generic capacity building to support for issues-based&#13;

        For many years, donor approaches have typically relied on technical assistance and training of&#13;
      project staff to perform specific tasks. Since the early 1990s, donors and multilateral lenders have&#13;
      increasingly sought to affect the broader context and institutional environment within which indi-&#13;
      viduals and organizations operate, rather than focus exclusively on training specific staff within&#13;
      selected organizations. This is premised on a new and broader approach to capacity development,&#13;
      one in which interventions take into account the larger institutional and political context within&#13;
      which various stakeholders and groups are willing and able to undertake reforms and affect change&#13;
      themselves. This Brief highlights DFID's experience in Nigeria in adopting an issues-based approach&#13;
      in which its role lies more in responding to and following--rather than leading--local change&#13;
      processes. This shifts the donor's role to engaging with a wider variety of stakeholders, identifying&#13;
      groups and coalitions that are most likely to drive and achieve institutional changes that can allevi-&#13;
      ate poverty, and to designing innovative means of supporting such locally driven efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Why focus on capacity at the institutional level?            Nigeria between 2000 and 2003. The programmes&#13;

            Where capacity is not the only problem :
            moving from generic capacity building to support for
            issues-based change in Nigeria
        </repnme>

            This brief highlights DFID's
            experience in Nigeria in adopting an issues-based approach
            in which its role lies more in responding to and following,
            rather than leading, local change processes. This shifts the
            donor's role to engaging with a wider variety of
            stakeholders, identifying groups and coalitions that are
            most likely to drive and achieve institutional changes that
            can alleviate poverty, and to designing innovative means of
            supporting such locally driven efforts. The paper comes to
            the conclusion that in environments where weak capacity is
            compounded by an absence of broad-based political will,
            donors need to develop new approaches. Development
            assistance that does not engage with the politics of
            institutional constraints, but focuses only on
            organizational capacity, will have limited impact in
            addressing poverty and may be counter-productive.
