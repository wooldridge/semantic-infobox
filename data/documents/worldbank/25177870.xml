&#13;
As part of the 2006-2011 National Development Plan, the Plurinational State of Bolivia&#13;
launched two cash transfer programs and one youth labor training program aimed at&#13;
promoting the accumulation of householdsâ&#128;&#153; human capital: the Juancito Pinto Educational&#13;
Grant, the Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant, and My First Decent Job. The objective of this&#13;
paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the targeting mechanisms utilized in these programs.&#13;
Based on the information provided by the Ongoing Household Survey, we estimate the&#13;
mechanismsâ&#128;&#153; potential inclusion and exclusion errors. The results permit us to suggest that&#13;
the categorical selection mechanisms used in the three programs are effective in reaching&#13;
the poorest population, although they present distinct levels of inclusion and exclusion errors&#13;
associated with both the design and implementation problems of the particular mechanism&#13;
utilized.&#13;

&amp;#12;I.    Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Social protection policies in the Plurinational State of Bolivia have undergone significant&#13;
transformations during the last 10 years. These changes parallel what has occurred in the&#13;
majority of Latin American countries, where diverse household cash transfer and youth labor&#13;
training programs have been implemented with the goal of alleviating poverty, contributing&#13;
to the development of human capital, stemming the intergenerational transmission of&#13;
poverty, and improving employability.&#13;
&#13;
The 2006-2011 National Development Plan articulated four strategies central to the&#13;
development of the country: Respectable, Democratic, Productive, and Sovereign Bolivia. The&#13;
first of these 2 refers to asset-creating sectors and inter-sectorial social protection programs.&#13;
The focus is not centered just on the provision of basic services, but also on the promotion of&#13;
householdsâ&#128;&#153; economic capacities. Its objectives include: a) create an equitable pattern of the&#13;
distribution of wealth and opportunities; b) promote the full exercise of dignity and&#13;
individualsâ&#128;&#153; and social groupsâ&#128;&#153; rights; and c) implement development programs designed to&#13;
drastically reduce risk situations and their consequences.&#13;
&#13;
As part of this strategy, the country launched a set of cash transfer and youth labor training&#13;
programs directed at promoting the accumulation of human capital within households. In&#13;
2006, the Juancito Pinto Educational Grant was created with the objective of increasing&#13;
school enrollment and reducing desertion rates among children and adolescents. Three years&#13;
later, the Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant was launched with the goal of decreasing the&#13;
levels of maternal and infant mortality and chronic malnutrition among children below age 2&#13;
through an incentive to use healthcare services. Finally, also in 2009, the â&#128;&#156;My First Decent&#13;
Jobâ&#128;&#157; Program was started with the goal of confronting the shortcomings in terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  The second strategy, Democratic Bolivia, refers to the formation of a Social-Community State where â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
people exercise social power and are co-responsible for decisions related to their own developmentâ&#128;&#157;. The third&#13;
strategy, Productive Bolivia is aimed at transforming the productive matrix to achieve the development of&#13;
Comprehensive Productive Complexes and giving the State the power to generate income and employment&#13;
surpluses based on the economyâ&#128;&#153;s strategic sectors. Finally, the fourth strategy, Sovereign Bolivia, refers to a&#13;
change in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s foreign policy with greater representation of â&#128;&#156;the peopleâ&#128;&#157; abroad and the defense of&#13;
natural resources and biodiversity.&#13;

&amp;#12;employability for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 by offering training and&#13;
internships.&#13;
&#13;
Since their launches, the three programs have faced the challenge of using effective&#13;
mechanisms to identify and register the target population. Regular evaluations of the&#13;
effectiveness of the application of the targeting instruments allow for the analysis of potential&#13;
modifications to the instruments, as well as identifying needs for strengthening their&#13;
application.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, the goal of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the existing targeting&#13;
mechanisms for each of the programs, while at the same time analyzing the results of the&#13;
recently launched single mechanism for beneficiary identification from the Ministry of&#13;
Development Planning. The application of a single mechanism should improve efficiency (by&#13;
reducing the cost of identifying potential beneficiaries) as well as effectiveness (by reducing&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors).&#13;
&#13;
This document presents six sections in addition to this Introduction. In the second section,&#13;
we present the analytical framework that guides the discussion of the targeting mechanisms&#13;
utilized by the three programs in the analyses described in the third section. In the third&#13;
section, we present the three programsâ&#128;&#153; general characteristics. Subsequently, in the fourth&#13;
section, we estimate the inclusion and exclusion errors associated with the beneficiary&#13;
identification tools for the three programs, under certain assumptions and design&#13;
characteristics, based on the information provided by the 2012 Ongoing Household Survey&#13;
(ECH), developed by the National Statistics Institute of Bolivia. In the fifth section, we&#13;
estimate the potential inclusion and exclusion errors for the recently launched Single Registry&#13;
of Beneficiaries for social programs. Finally, we offer some final reflections and provide a&#13;
bibliography of the works consulted.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.   Analytical Framework&#13;
&#13;
 The design and implementation of social protection policies rely on correctly diagnosing the&#13;
 problem or risk to be addressed. Examples include: vulnerability of a specific population&#13;
 group in the face of a situation of poverty or an elevated school desertion rate â&#128;&#147; a lack of&#13;
 accumulation of human capital â&#128;&#147; among children and youth, with a special emphasis on those&#13;
 that belong to households living in poverty, to mention a few. An accurate diagnosis permits&#13;
 one to define the target population that the initiative aims to reach with greater precision.&#13;
 This leads to the necessity of choosing a mechanism that allows for the identification of&#13;
 potentially eligible individuals. In general terms, there are two alternatives for reaching these&#13;
 individuals: either a universal program or a targeted one.&#13;
&#13;
 The arguments in favor of universalization as a strategy to eradicate poverty have an ethical,&#13;
 political, and practical basis. The principal point of reference is the European experience,&#13;
 where poverty has been successfully fought via a framework of policies centered on&#13;
 guaranteeing services with universal coverage.&#13;
&#13;
 Supporters of universal policies posit that the State should effectively guarantee basic rights,&#13;
 distributing the available resources among all citizens, regardless of whether or not they will&#13;
 be recovered, through direct general revenue schemes. Funds should originate from&#13;
 individuals with higher incomes. Nonetheless, available resources are generally limited. This&#13;
 requires policymakers to maximize their impact when they are put to useâ&#128;&#148;in other words,&#13;
 to utilize the funds efficiently such that the greatest expected impact is achieved.&#13;
&#13;
 Therefore, the arguments in favor of creating targeted policies are based on the need to focus&#13;
 the benefits on the target population, thus increasing efficiency in the use of cash transfers&#13;
 aimed at combating the problem or risk factor as previously identified through an assessment&#13;
 of the situation. Targeting criteria commonly used in social protection programs are age,&#13;
 gender, employment status, level of poverty, and/or geographic location. The utilization of&#13;
 targeting criteria as a condition for potential beneficiaries facing poverty requires&#13;
 policymakers to develop more complex, specific tools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               -5-&#13;
&amp;#12;In any case, following the situational assessment, the way in which the potentially eligible&#13;
population is defined and the argument behind this definition are key factors in terms of the&#13;
policyâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness. In contrast, incorrectly defining the target population could result in&#13;
design errors in the selection of beneficiaries. Based on the previous examples, the target&#13;
population could be households living in poverty and school-age children and youth living in&#13;
poverty. Once the problem and/or risk factor is assessed and the potentially eligible&#13;
population is defined, one must design a tool that allows said population to be identified and&#13;
reached.&#13;
&#13;
In all cases, applying targeting criteria in social programs entails an administrative cost&#13;
associated with the work of creating, implementing, updating, and supervising the selection&#13;
tools (socioeconomic records, household surveys, poverty maps, etc.). One relevant aspect&#13;
when targeting mechanisms are designed is to evaluate whether the additional costs&#13;
associated with targeting are greater than the costs of universalization, represented as the&#13;
amount of transfers that reach the non-poor population for example (Atkinson, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
The goal of targeting is for a social programâ&#128;&#153;s resources to only reach the population whose&#13;
socioeconomic status is situated below the established threshold, as well as attempting to&#13;
ensure as much as possible that all members of the target group benefit from the program.&#13;
However, in addition to the increased administrative costs, there is a risk of committing two&#13;
types of targeting errors: inclusion and exclusion (Cornia and Steward, 1992). While&#13;
universalization schemes do not face exclusion errors (the exclusion from the program of&#13;
individuals and households that belong to the target group), in the case of targeted policies,&#13;
and depending on the effectiveness of the mechanisms utilized, these schemes can face both&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors.&#13;
&#13;
A standard exercise when one wants to evaluate the effectiveness of targeting mechanisms&#13;
is to analyze the tradeoff that exists between both types of errors. As a program attempts to&#13;
minimize inclusion errorsâ&#128;&#148;in other words, the more a program tries to avoid that the&#13;
ineligible population (the non-poor, for example) is includedâ&#128;&#148;the probability of committing&#13;
an exclusion error increases, meaning that poorer people are left out of the program. In other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             -6-&#13;
&amp;#12;words, the more eligibility requirements there are and the stricter they are, the smaller the&#13;
group of potentially eligible beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
The risk of committing these kinds of errors can originate during two stages of the policy:&#13;
design and implementation. Regarding the former, inclusion and exclusion errors can emerge&#13;
as a consequence of incorrectly identifying the target population. For example, they could&#13;
result from design flaws in the mechanism: selecting personal and household characteristics&#13;
that are not correlated with the real problem or risk factor. In addition, the implementation&#13;
process, in other words identifying and approaching the programâ&#128;&#153;s target population, can find&#13;
itself dependent on or limited by the programâ&#128;&#153;s ability to reach the target population: it is not&#13;
clear who they are, where they are located, or how to approach them.&#13;
&#13;
Targeting Mechanisms. The objective of targeting mechanisms is to correctly and efficiently&#13;
identify which households meet the eligibility requirements and which do not. The methods&#13;
for reaching a beneficiary group are divided into three categories: individual/family&#13;
evaluation; categorical and geographic selection; and self-targeting.&#13;
&#13;
The individual/family evaluation determines for each household or individual if the applicant&#13;
meets the eligibility requirements established by the program. This type of tool requires the&#13;
highest level of effort from the program.&#13;
&#13;
Within this category, the verified proxy means test stands out. It compiles (nearly) complete&#13;
information on household income level and/or assets and verifies this information with&#13;
independent sources, such as spending, tax, and other records. This requires that verifiable&#13;
records for the beneficiary population must exist and be updated regularly, as well as the&#13;
need for the administrative capacity to process this information.&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of the capacity to carry out a verified means test, other individual evaluation&#13;
mechanisms are generally used. The three most common are simple proxy means testing,&#13;
substituted proxy means testing, and community-based selection.&#13;
&#13;
In simple means testing, the conditions stated by the beneficiaries are not verified. A&#13;
household visit from one of the programâ&#128;&#153;s social workers could help to qualitatively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               -7-&#13;
&amp;#12;corroborate that the apparent living conditions reasonably coincide with the stated data. On&#13;
the other hand, evaluations performed by social workers could be completely qualitative and&#13;
account for many factors related to the householdâ&#128;&#153;s needs and means, without the&#13;
requirement to quantify them.&#13;
&#13;
Proxy means testing is a system that scores each of the household or individual applicants&#13;
based on easily observable characteristics, such as the location and quality of the residence,&#13;
ownership of durable goods, household demographic structure, educational level, and&#13;
employment status. The indicators or formulas used to calculate these scores and their&#13;
weighting are derived from a statistical analysis of data from detailed household surveys.&#13;
Generally, the information provided by the applicant is partially verified by gathering&#13;
information from a household visit performed by a representative of the program.&#13;
&#13;
Community-based selection uses a group of community members or one of their leaders&#13;
whose principal function is not related to the transfer program to decide which members of&#13;
the community should benefit from the program. An example of this is using special&#13;
committees comprised of community members or a combination of community members&#13;
and local officials to establish eligibility for a program. The idea behind this method is that&#13;
local knowledge of familiesâ&#128;&#153; living conditions could be more accurate than data gathered via&#13;
means testing performed by a program representative.&#13;
&#13;
The risk of committing inclusion and/or exclusion errors resulting from the setting up and&#13;
utilizing this type of mechanism is related to the level of correlation that exists between the&#13;
individual or household characteristics that are evaluated and those which truly determine&#13;
whether one is eligible or not, poverty for example. The more correlated actual poverty is&#13;
with the means that are measured (educational level, household property, mobile phone&#13;
ownership, etc.), the fewer inclusion and exclusion errors there will be.&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of a targeting mechanism can result in these kinds of errors as well. For&#13;
example, the capabilities of the workers responsible for gathering data from each&#13;
individual/household determines the degree of error minimization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             -8-&#13;
&amp;#12;Categorical selection refers to a method by which all of the individuals in a specific category&#13;
meet the requirements to receive the benefit. This method is also known as statistical&#13;
selection, classification, or group targeting and determines eligibility in terms of easily&#13;
observable individual or family characteristics that are difficult to distort and are correlated&#13;
with the relevant characteristic (for example, poverty). Examples include: age, gender,&#13;
ethnicity, land ownership, demographic makeup, geographical location, the type of&#13;
educational institution attended, and the type of formal healthcare coverage possessed. Age&#13;
is a category that is frequently utilized in family cash transfer programs which are principally&#13;
used in transitioning countries, in supplemental nutrition programs for children below age&#13;
five which are common in poor countries, and in non-contributory pensions for the elderly.&#13;
Characteristics like unemployment and disabilities are more difficult to verify, but it is also&#13;
possible to use categorical selection for cash transfers to these groups.&#13;
&#13;
Here again, correctly defining category in terms of its correlation to the real risk factor&#13;
determines the degree of inclusion and/or exclusion error that may result.&#13;
&#13;
Geographic targeting means determining the eligible population based on where they live&#13;
(state, municipality, neighborhood, etc.). This type of mechanism is frequently used and is&#13;
generally combined with other methods.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, via self-targeting a program is open to the entire population, but its design includes&#13;
features meant to incentivize just the participation of those households or groups that belong&#13;
to a specific group (for example, poor households), thereby disincentivizing the participation&#13;
of those that do not belong to this group. This is achieved by recognizing the differences in&#13;
the private costs of participation faced by poor and non-poor households. Examples of self-&#13;
targeting include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ employment programs with low salaries, so that only unemployed workers with low or no&#13;
  opportunity costs will participate;&#13;
â&#128;¢ delivering the transfer via a mechanism that includes lining up and is limited to certain&#13;
  hours;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              -9-&#13;
&amp;#12;  â&#128;¢ transferring in-kind benefits with characteristics of â&#128;&#156;inferior goodsâ&#128;&#157; (for example, flour,&#13;
       low-quality rice, etc.); and&#13;
  â&#128;¢ situating service delivery points (supply warehouses, clinics or hospitals, and participating&#13;
       schools, etc.) such that the non-poor population would incur greater costs (private and&#13;
       social).&#13;

III.      Transfer programs in Bolivia&#13;
                  3.1 Juancito Pinto Grant (BJP)&#13;
&#13;
  In 2006, the national government of Bolivia decided to incentivize school enrollment and&#13;
  reduce desertion in the formal education system as one of its principal goals. Supreme Decree&#13;
  28,899 created the conditional cash transfer program known as the Juancito Pinto Grant&#13;
  (BJP). The BJP provides an annual transfer of Bs. 200 as an incentive to reduce school absence&#13;
  and desertion and to increase childrenâ&#128;&#153;s enrollment and continuity in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  educational institutions.&#13;
&#13;
  The target population consists of children and youth that attend the formal education system&#13;
  at public institutions. The program increased its target population over time, including more&#13;
  educational levels over the years, as shown in Table 1.&#13;

&amp;#12;For each year, the mechanism to identify potential beneficiaries uses categorical selection&#13;
given that their eligibility is defined in terms of their individual characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
After multiple modifications to the regulations, Supreme Decree 1,372 of 2012 established&#13;
that the programâ&#128;&#153;s target population consisted of all primary school students (first through&#13;
sixth years) and students from the first, second, and third years of secondary school, including&#13;
Special Education and Alternative Youth Education students from all public sector educational&#13;
institutions and private institutions with agreements with the government. Additionally, the&#13;
BJP sets an age limit of 18 years old in order to receive the grant for the formal education and&#13;
alternative youth education systems. Based on this categorization, those children and&#13;
adolescents that attend private educational institutions are excluded from the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
benefits. Students must achieve a regular attendance rate of at least 80% during the school&#13;
year in order to receive the transfer. Figure 3.1 shows the evolution of the number of&#13;
beneficiaries and the total expenditure directed toward financing the BJP from 2006 to 2012.&#13;

&#13;
The Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant (BJA) was created in 2009 with the objective of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;decreasing the levels of maternal and infant mortality and chronic malnutrition among&#13;
children younger than two years oldâ&#128;&#157;. The target population comprises all pregnant women&#13;
and children younger than two years old that do not have formal healthcare coverage. The&#13;
stipend is a cash incentive of Bs. 320 that is given to the pregnant woman for attending four&#13;
prenatal checkups, Bs. 50 for each one, a delivery attended by healthcare personnel, and one&#13;
postnatal checkup (Bs. 120). For children younger than age 2, the program delivers a transfer&#13;
of Bs. 125 for each of the childâ&#128;&#153;s two-month development checkups. In total, the mother&#13;
receives an incentive of Bs. 1,820.&#13;
&#13;
The program comprises a â&#128;&#156;demandâ&#128;&#157; incentive for healthcare services and covers all of the&#13;
municipalities in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3.2 shows the evolution of the number of beneficiaries and the programâ&#128;&#153;s expenditure&#13;
on transfers between 2009 and 2013. Given the high degree of turnover of pregnant women&#13;
and children due to their short participation in the program, reduced annual affiliation efforts&#13;
have resulted in a reduction in the number of beneficiaries.&#13;

                 3.3 . My First Decent Job&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;My First Decent Jobâ&#128;&#157; Programâ&#128;&#153;s (MPED) principal objective is to increase labor force&#13;
insertion and improve employability among youth. It is directed at men and women between&#13;
the ages of 18 and 24 that have completed primary school in the public system and/or schools&#13;
with an Agreement with the public system, have limited resources, are from urban and&#13;
suburban areas, and are unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
In order for a young person to be considered eligible for the program, he or she must have a&#13;
per capita family income below the poverty line                            3   and meet one of the following&#13;
requirements:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢     Electricity consumption per family. The government has determined that households&#13;
          with consumption equal to or less than 70 kWh per month are charged a â&#128;&#156;Dignityâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
          rate because they are considered to be low-income families. Consequently, youth that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 The poverty line values are updated once they are published by the National Statistics Institute (INE) and take&#13;
effect for eligibility evaluations performed for potential beneficiaries following the dataâ&#128;&#153;s publication by the INE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;       come from households that consume up to 70 kWh of electricity are also considered&#13;
       low-income.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Type of educational institution. The Bolivian Government has established that the&#13;
       Juancito Pinto Grant will be directed to children that study in state educational&#13;
       institutions or those that have agreements with the state, with the assumption that&#13;
       these institutions provide services to low-income families. This government-defined&#13;
       criterion is one of those adopted by the Program. Consequently, youth from state&#13;
       secondary schools or those with an agreement with the state meet the eligibility&#13;
       criteria established by the Program.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation of the program began as a pilot in five cities (El Alto, La Paz, Santa Cruz de la&#13;
Sierra, Cochabamba, and Montero) in 2009 and was extended to mid-2010, reaching a total&#13;
of 2,562 beneficiaries. Following an evaluation process with an eye toward beginning the&#13;
expansion phase, the programâ&#128;&#153;s design was modified, coverage was expanded to the cities of&#13;
Tarija and Sucre and the management of the program in Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Montero&#13;
was combined.&#13;
&#13;
The expansion phase was finally launched at the beginning of 2012 and was expected to be&#13;
completed in the first semester of 2015, with a total of 1,400 young people trained. Beginning&#13;
in July 2015, the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security (MTEPS) will launch a&#13;
third phase of the program, increasing coverage to the nine departmental capital cities and&#13;
Ciudad del Alto, in addition to 5 medium-sized cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants.&#13;
During the next 5 years, the program is expected to provide 1,200 beneficiaries per year with&#13;
basic and intermediate technical degrees.&#13;
&#13;
In budget terms, even though the program received budget increases throughout the period,&#13;
with the most significant in 2014, its implementations capabilities were weak. On average it&#13;
has not surpassed an annual execution of more than 50% of its resources.&#13;

IV.   Analysis of the effectiveness of the programsâ&#128;&#153; targeting mechanisms&#13;
            4.1 Juancito Pinto Grant (BJP)&#13;
&#13;
 In the case of the BJP, two analyses of the targeting mechanism were performed utilizing the&#13;
 2012 Household Survey. First, the programâ&#128;&#153;s exclusion errors were analyzed, and secondly&#13;
 we evaluated whether or not the categorical selection criterion showed a relationship with&#13;
 the beneficiary householdâ&#128;&#153;s socioeconomic status.&#13;
&#13;
 Analysis of targeting errors in the BJP. The programâ&#128;&#153;s target population is students under&#13;
 age 18 that are enrolled in the first 8 years of formal education in public educational&#13;
 institutions and private institutions with agreements with the state. Table 4.1 shows the&#13;
 distribution of beneficiaries by the type of educational institution they attend.&#13;

According to the information provided by the 2012 ECH, the majority of the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
beneficiaries attend public institutions, while less than 10% attend private schools with&#13;
agreements.&#13;
&#13;
With the goal of determining if the program is making exclusion errors, Table 4.2 presents&#13;
the distribution of students under age 18 that have studied up to the eighth year of formal&#13;
education, according to whether or not they receive the BJP transfer.&#13;

The results presented in Table 3 suggest the existence of some 18.7% of students up to the&#13;
eighth grade in state institutions and 24.4% of those that attend private schools with state&#13;
agreements that do not receive the BJPâ&#128;&#153;s cash transfer.&#13;

Analysis of the incidence of poverty in the BJP. Even though it is not explicitly explained in&#13;
the law that created the program, it is possible that the categorical selection related to the&#13;
presence of state funding in the schools that are the target of the program is related to the&#13;

&amp;#12;objective of incentivizing the accumulation of human capital among the population that&#13;
attends those schools. Additionally, it is assumed that the population that attends public&#13;
schools or private ones with state agreements is poor and requires this type of incentive for&#13;
the formation of human capital. Table 4 shows the incidence of poverty among students&#13;
under age 18 by the type of educational institution that they attend.&#13;

Although the incidence of poverty among students at public institutions and private&#13;
institutions with state agreements is greater than that among private institutions, there is a&#13;
high percentage of non-poor students in those institutions. In effect, some 41.2% of the&#13;
students at state schools and 59.4% of those that attend schools that have agreements with&#13;
the state are not poor. Figure 4.1 shows that the presence of BJP beneficiaries among the&#13;
above 60 percent of the income distribution in private institutions with agreements is much&#13;
important than in public institutions. Finally, the use of public funding at schools as a proxy&#13;
of poverty, leads to inclusion errors based on the mechanismâ&#128;&#153;s design, especially for private&#13;
schools with agreements, and to exclusion errors as almost 20% of students in private&#13;
institutions is poor.&#13;

In conclusion, if one assumes that the objective of the BJP is to support poor children so that&#13;
they complete their secondary education, then the targeting mechanism, based on its design,&#13;
creates inclusion errors (non-poor children that attend public schools or those with state&#13;
agreements) as well as exclusion errors (poor children that attend private schools).&#13;

           4.2 . Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant (BJA)&#13;
&#13;
Just as we performed with the Juancito Pinto Grant, in this section we undertake an&#13;
evaluation of the application of the programâ&#128;&#153;s targeting mechanisms and an analysis of the&#13;
incidence of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of targeting errors in the BJA. Table 4.4 shows the distribution of women by their&#13;
status as beneficiaries of the Juana Azurduy Grant and whether they care for children under&#13;
age 2.&#13;

&#13;
Of the total number of women enrolled in the Juana Azurduy Grant, 88.4% have children&#13;
under age two, while the remaining 11.6% do not have children. Of the total number of&#13;
women in the latter group, 26.4% of them are pregnant and thus eligible for the grant.&#13;
&#13;
With the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the profile of the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
beneficiaries, Table 4.5 presents the distribution of beneficiary women in the Juana Azurduy&#13;
Grant program by the type of healthcare coverage they have.&#13;

&#13;
Of the total number of beneficiaries, 81.9% do not have short-term coverage, while 8.8% are&#13;
covered by social security in health. In addition, 7.8% of the women beneficiaries have health&#13;
insurance from the departmental governments. Finally, 1.5% of beneficiaries state that they&#13;
have private healthcare coverage. These latter three categories of coverage signal clear&#13;
inclusion errors. Although this inclusion error is small, concerns emerge related to the failings&#13;
of the operational mechanisms of the categorical selection tool, inasmuch as it is not possible&#13;
to clearly identify the type of coverage that some beneficiaries enjoy.&#13;

&amp;#12;Keeping the eligibility criteria around the coverage of social security in health is a good proxy&#13;
to the householdsâ&#128;&#153; level of poverty. Table 4.6 shows the distribution of women according to&#13;
their level of poverty and the type of health coverage they have and it ratifies a strong&#13;
correlation between the lack of health coverage and poverty. In effect, of the individuals that&#13;
belong to poor households, one observes that 83% do not have health coverage.&#13;

&#13;
However, the table also shows a strong correlation between the lack of coverage and not&#13;
being poor, with almost 62% of the non-poor also not having healthcare coverage. These&#13;
results suggest that the use of the category of no healthcare coverage could also create an&#13;
inclusion error based on the mechanismâ&#128;&#153;s design.&#13;

Analysis of the incidence of poverty in the BJA. A poverty incidence analysis was undertaken,&#13;

&#13;
Based on these values, if one adds a householdâ&#128;&#153;s level of poverty to the categorical eligibility&#13;
criteria, then the exclusion error is 33.5% and the inclusion error is 10.7%. In terms of the first&#13;
error, it is associated with the programâ&#128;&#153;s operational problems, insomuch as it does not&#13;
manage to reach the entire population of potentially eligible individuals. Figure 4.2 shows&#13;
that almost 23% of beneficiaries of the BJA of the third quintile of income distribution, a&#13;
population group that is vulnerable and eventually only exceeds the poverty line after&#13;
receiving a transfer from the program. Finally, the existence of 25% of beneficiaries in the&#13;
two highest quintiles of income distribution could be explained by the inclusion errors&#13;
created by the lack of objective mechanism of verifying the coverage of social security in&#13;
health (the program uses self declaration instead of cross data base checking).&#13;

            4.3 . My First Decent Job (MPED)&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;My First Decent Jobâ&#128;&#157; Programâ&#128;&#153;s principal objective is to increase labor insertion and&#13;
improve employability of young people. It is aimed at men and women between the ages of&#13;
18 and 24 that have completed primary school in public schools or those with agreements&#13;
with the state, have low income, are from urban and suburban areas, and are unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
As was mentioned previously, an individual targeting mechanism based on simple means&#13;
testing is applied which combines a self-declared household income with the presentation of&#13;
an energy bill or demonstration of attendance at a public educational institution. The&#13;

&amp;#12;programâ&#128;&#153;s eligibility limits are a per capita income below the poverty line and household&#13;
energy consumption below 70 kWh.&#13;
&#13;
Due to the impossibility of identifying the beneficiaries via the ongoing household survey, the&#13;
following paragraphs present an approximation of the target population based on estimating&#13;
electricity expenditure, the type of educational institution that young persons attended, and&#13;
their level of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Household expenditure on electricity associated with consumption less than 70 kWh per&#13;
month is calculated based on the information presented in Table 4.8:&#13;

&#13;
Based on this information, consumption of 70 kWh is equivalent to:&#13;
&#13;
                 í µí°ºí µí°ºí µí±&#150;í µí±&#150; ,í µí±&#144;í µí±&#144;â&#137;¤70 = ($22.420 + 50í µí±¥í µí±¥$0.065 + 20í µí±¥í µí±¥$0.414)í µí±¥í µí±¥1.15 = í µí°µí µí°µí µí°µí µí°µ40&#13;
&#13;
A household that spends up to Bs40 per month would be consuming less than 70 kWh during&#13;
said period. Based on this calculation, and with information from the ECH (2012), it is possible&#13;
to identify those households that consume less than 70 kWh per month.&#13;

&#13;
Among the young people that are below the poverty line, some 45.8% attend/attended a&#13;
public educational institution and consume less than 70 kWh of electricity; 0.2% only&#13;
consumed less electricity than the established parameter; and 51.4% only attended a formal&#13;
public educational institution.&#13;
&#13;
These results suggest that the probability of committing an exclusion error is not significant&#13;
from the point of view of the design of the eligibility requirements, to the extent that the&#13;
majority of young people living in poverty also meet at least one of the other two&#13;
requirements. Nonetheless, this mechanism contains some risks. On one hand, it could create&#13;
an exclusion error, if a phenomenon of stigmatization of poverty were to present itself. This&#13;
has a greater probability of occurring in geographic areas with heterogeneous income levels.&#13;
On the other hand, an inclusion error could occur if there were incentives to understate&#13;
income. With this in mind, given that a large proportion of non-poor young people (85.5%)&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12; meet at least one of the other requirements, there could be incentives to understate&#13;
 household per capita income.&#13;
&#13;
 In this context, and considering institutional capabilities, one alternative in order to avoid&#13;
 these risks is to utilize records for means testing. Having recognized this possibility, in the&#13;
 future the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security has decided to use the results&#13;
 of the Single Registry of Beneficiaries targeting mechanism implemented by the Ministry of&#13;
 Development Planning for the Program. The next section analyzes the general characteristics&#13;
 of the Registry and its potential to be used in Boliviaâ&#128;&#153;s social protection programs.&#13;
&#13;
V.    Estimation of inclusion and exclusion errors in the new Single Registry of Beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
 With the goal of improving the quality and coverage of the current and future registries of&#13;
 beneficiaries of social programs in Bolivia, the Ministry of Development Planning, through the&#13;
 Unit for Analysis of Social and Economic Policies (UDAPE), developed a targeting mechanism&#13;
 known as the Single Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB) that utilizes the means testing method.&#13;
 The Ministry of Development Planning aims to reach agreements with the social programs&#13;
 operated by the various Ministries that utilize beneficiary selection mechanisms based on&#13;
 vulnerability and/or poverty. Following the example of other countries, such as Peruâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 Household Selection System (SISFOH) and Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s Social Program Potential Beneficiary&#13;
 Identification System (SISBEN), a single, poverty-based targeting mechanism allows for&#13;
 selection criteria to be standardized, reducing identification costs and improving the final&#13;
 results of the targeting process.&#13;
&#13;
 The development of the RUB represents a planning and monitoring tool that would allow&#13;
 policymakers to create a database of households and their members based on their&#13;
 demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in order to categorize households according&#13;
 to their level of poverty. The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are collected&#13;
 through a survey carried out in a census of households located in specific areas of the country.&#13;
&#13;
 The RUB uses a probit model in order to estimate the probability that an individual/household&#13;
 will be below the poverty line as a function of the data collected by the RUB survey. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 25 -&#13;
&amp;#12;objective is not just to determine the significance of the collected variables, but also to&#13;
establish an estimate of the potential exclusion and inclusion errors that could occur.&#13;
&#13;
The regressors to be considered are divided into 3 groups of variables:&#13;
&#13;
  i.    Personal characteristics: age, gender with a value of one if the individual is male,&#13;
        educational level, and employment status.&#13;
  ii.   Characteristics of the residence: urban/rural, residential property, principal material&#13;
        used in the walls.&#13;
 iii.   Household characteristics: mobile and fixed telephone ownership, household&#13;
        members per room.&#13;
&#13;
In order to evaluate the significance of the variables and the potential inclusion and exclusion&#13;
errors, we utilized data from the Ongoing Household Survey (ECH) from 2012. The surveyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
objective is to generate and follow indicators on the incidence of poverty, wellbeing, and the&#13;
populationâ&#128;&#153;s living conditions. The survey is performed at a national level, covering both&#13;
urban and rural areas. Therefore, the study population included the sum of all private&#13;
residences and their occupants in urban and rural areas of the country.&#13;
&#13;
Taking into consideration the demographic and socioeconomic variables from the RUB, we&#13;
performed a multivariate analysis designed to estimate the probability of belonging to a poor&#13;
household as a function of this set of characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
The estimates undertaken show a good regression adjustment, with a success ratio&#13;
equivalent to 69%. As was expected, the educational level is negatively associated with the&#13;
probability of being poor. Similarly, the number of household members per room positively&#13;
affects the likelihood of poverty. On the other hand, those households that reside in urban&#13;
areas and have fixed line and/or mobile telephone service are the households with the least&#13;
probability of falling below the poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s economic status significantly affects the probability that they are poor in terms of&#13;
income. In effect, being employed or unemployed has a lesser or greater impact on poverty,&#13;
respectively, in relation to inactivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;Finally, the effects of home ownership are not so clear. The estimator of the dummy variable&#13;
that takes a value of one if the household residence is owned turns out to be statistically&#13;
significant and positive in terms of explaining the probability of being poor. Although this&#13;
result is counterintuitive, it is associated with the low variability of this characteristic among&#13;
the study population.&#13;

&#13;
 Based on this theoretical exercise, we estimate that the design of the RUB generates an&#13;
 inclusion error of 19.1% and an exclusion error of 11.9%. The exposure to these kinds of errors&#13;
 is always present. Policymakersâ&#128;&#153; efforts focus on minimizing their presence, and this is&#13;
 dependent on the number and type of characteristics that are gathered in order to&#13;
 approximate the state of income poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 The definition of the target population based on its level of income poverty, requires some&#13;
 mechanisms other than self-declaration in order to eliminate the risk of understatement. In&#13;
 general, means testing mechanisms gather a set of characteristics related to the household,&#13;
 the residence, and the members that make it up, and this is actually one of the causes of the&#13;
 existence of these kinds of errors. In that regard, the characteristics of the residence, the&#13;
 building materials for example, are aspects that are more linked to the concept of structural&#13;
 poverty or to unmet basic needs (NBI) than to a lack of resources. In general, the correlation&#13;
 between the direct and indirect concepts of poverty is not one-to-one, due to the fact that a&#13;
 lack of resources does not necessarily mean there are unmet needs, given that goods and&#13;
 services can come from public, family, accumulated capital sources.&#13;
&#13;
 Nonetheless, this exercise is a theoretical approximation of the potentially achievable results&#13;
 with this mechanism based on a probit model. The final calibration of the mechanism should&#13;
 be performed when it is put to use with a significant group of beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
VI.       Conclusions and future challenges&#13;
&#13;
 The Plurinational State of Bolivia launched the BJP, BJA, and MPED programs in 2006. They&#13;
 are designed to promote the accumulation of human capital among households and improve&#13;
 employability. The three programs are directed toward well-defined population groups and&#13;
 present specific eligibility requirements. With the exception of the MPED, the programsâ&#128;&#153; goals&#13;
 do not explicitly include covering the poor population. However, given that the challenges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;that the BJP and BJA aim to cover are strongly correlated with a householdâ&#128;&#153;s poverty level&#13;
(secondary school desertion, infant malnutrition, and a lack of access to healthcare services),&#13;
in this paper we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the targeting mechanisms for&#13;
covering the poor population. In order to do this, we evaluated the inclusion and exclusion&#13;
errors resulting from applying the mechanisms to the general population and to the&#13;
programsâ&#128;&#153; beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
The inclusion and exclusion errors from the BJP and BJA are moderate when the effectiveness&#13;
of the design of the identification mechanism is evaluated. If one assumes that the objective&#13;
of the BJP is to support poor children to complete their secondary education, then the&#13;
targeting mechanism, based on its design, generates inclusion errors (non-poor children that&#13;
attend public schools or private schools with state agreements at a rate between 40% and&#13;
60% approximately) and exclusion errors (poor children that attend private schools at a rate&#13;
near 15%). In turn, the BJA, which considers not just the type of health insurance that the&#13;
beneficiary has, but also her level of poverty, generates a potential inclusion error of 10% and&#13;
an exclusion error of 33%.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, in the case of the MPED the probability of committing an exclusion error is not&#13;
significant in terms of the design of the eligibility requirements insomuch as the majority of&#13;
young people living in poverty also meet at least one of the other two targeting requirements&#13;
(formal education in the public system or a private school with a state agreement and&#13;
household electricity consumption at the social rate level). In any case, the mechanism&#13;
contains some risk of generating inclusion errors associated with the household income level&#13;
requirement because incentives to understate income could exist, especially within the group&#13;
of non-poor young people that meets the selection criteria (some 85% of non-poor youth&#13;
meet at least one of these requirements).&#13;
&#13;
Keeping in mind the limitations of identifying the poor population as demonstrated by the&#13;
mechanisms evaluated in the three programs, one notes a future opportunity to begin to use&#13;
the results of the means testing selection mechanism developed under the auspices of the&#13;
Single Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB), as implemented by the Ministry of Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 29 -&#13;
&amp;#12;Planning (MPD). This tool attempts to obtain an estimate of individualsâ&#128;&#153; level of income&#13;
poverty, according to a set of characteristics related to their residences, households, and&#13;
household members. The results of an initial evaluation of the toolâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness have&#13;
shown low inclusion and exclusion errorsâ&#128;&#148;fewer than those generated by the current&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
The MPD is in the process of collecting household data and is beginning to reach agreements&#13;
with the various social programs so they can use this targeting mechanism. Accordingly, the&#13;
MPED decided to utilize the results of the RUB once it has covered the programâ&#128;&#153;s target cities.&#13;
Subsequent agreements with other social programs will improve their effectiveness in terms&#13;
of targeting, while at the same time increasing their efficiency by decreasing the cost of&#13;
beneficiary selection.&#13;
&#13;
Clearly, this entails a very significant qualitative change, insofar as the use of the RUB involves&#13;
explicitly stating the poverty level as an eligibility criterion for social protection transfer&#13;
programs.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
As part of the 2006â&#128;&#147;2011 National Development Plan, the Plurinational State of Bolivia&#13;
launched two cash transfer programs and one youth labor training program aimed at promoting&#13;
the accumulation of householdsâ&#128;&#153; human capital: the Juancito Pinto Educational Grant, the&#13;
Juana Azurduy Mother-Child Grant, and My First Decent Job. The objective of this paper is to&#13;
analyze the effectiveness of the targeting mechanisms utilized in these programs. Based on the&#13;
information provided by the Ongoing Household Survey, we estimate the mechanismsâ&#128;&#153; potential&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors. The results permit us to suggest that the categorical selection&#13;
mechanisms used in the three programs are effective in reaching the poorest population,&#13;
although they present distinct levels of inclusion and exclusion errors associated with both the&#13;
design and implementation problems of the particular mechanism utilized.&#13;
