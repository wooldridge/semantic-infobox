                         PLACB:       813-131, WORLD BAHK&#13;
                         PRESENT:     JOHB LEWIS, RJ:CHARD WBBB, DEVBSB KAPUR, PAUL J:SBNKMAN,&#13;
                                                                                                 \&#13;
&#13;
                              Early experience in India in 1959-60: worked with Brahmananda)&#13;
                         in Bombay on monetary policy; also on the Planning Commission and&#13;
                         the Reserve Bank of India. Planning was the big thing those days.&#13;
                         He remembers in 1963 the Bank was starting a program in Peru.&#13;
                         Kennedy's alliance for progress was big those days and a message&#13;
                         came from the White House, "Make sure they have a five year plan".&#13;
                              John or Richard asked him how having spend almost his entire&#13;
                         career with operations he sees his role in PRE. He thinks it has&#13;
                         worked out well. PRE can look ahead to give operations a guide both&#13;
                         at the sector level as well as macroeconomic policy. What is new is&#13;
                         the marriage of sector work with macroeconomic work. Earlier sector&#13;
                         work was directly linked to operations. Now for the first time the&#13;
                         two are organizationally interlinked at the research side.&#13;
                              Richard then asked how much of PREs resources are given to&#13;
                         guiding the Bank i.e. internally directed vis-a-vis the external&#13;
                         development community. John questioned whether this micro-macro&#13;
                         i.e. sector-macroeconomics linkage was really new. After all&#13;
                         Mahbub's DPS shop as well as the work of Little and Page on small-&#13;
                         scale industry had strong micro dimensions. Thalwitz questioned&#13;
                         this. The nitty-gritty expertise lay in much more operational&#13;
  ki~       .      "I'   expertise. Thus, for example, as a transport economist the&#13;
"(t..flJ1rA-~' 1    .    implications of different values of "ton-km" in different settings&#13;
     l                   would immediately catch his attention. Hollis saw his main client&#13;
                         as the outside world. With the present organizational set up the&#13;
                         OPS function has moved from operations to PRE. However having an&#13;
                         operations person to head it has a corrective function built in.&#13;
                              John raised the point that Warren Baum had contended that OPS&#13;
                         had a quality control function - a second guessing function that&#13;
                         was lost with this move. Thalwitz countered that there was a&#13;
                         downside to this in that in there was a potential conflict of&#13;
                         interest. For instance if they were asked how we have done in&#13;
                         population or transport, they would become rather defensive about&#13;
                         it. Paul Isenmann introduced a new twist. Between the different&#13;
                         complexes there is a lot of rivalry. While the criticism came from&#13;
                         OPS it did not raise many hackles in operations - the all-in-the&#13;
                         family syndrome. But with the move to a different complex the&#13;
                         reaction is very defensive. Therefore organizational independence&#13;
                         may have been gained at the expense of stifling the debate within&#13;
                         operations because now it has to be carried on between complexes&#13;
                         rather than within a complex.&#13;
                             With OED there is very little collaboration. OED's work is&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       t&#13;
                                                  &lt;.L ~-L i~&#13;

                                 I&#13;
     much more dated. "They are' our h'        Â·&#13;

     related to ongoing work' while OED' s is/much more in the past.&#13;
     However Operations and PRE are still part of the same family. OED&#13;
     is really out of it because of its special status vis-a-vis the&#13;
     Board.&#13;
          Hollis's emphasis on the outside world, on trying to give&#13;
     intellectual leadership and not really bothered with what happened&#13;
     last year or what should be done next year. PRE now hosts about 250&#13;
     seminars a year. An intrinsic value is attached in the Bank being&#13;
     a major player in development debate, as a form of interface with&#13;
     the development community.                                Â·&#13;
          Richard asked about Conable' s conscious and deliberate concern&#13;
     with the issue of intellectual leadership. Hopper (Thalwitz 's&#13;
     interpretation) felt that he was receiving mixed signals from&#13;
     Conable on whether PRE should provide prescriptive support to&#13;
     operations as well as give the Bank intellectual leadership. Hopper&#13;
     emphasized the first objective but was then told that the Bank was&#13;
     not doing enough of the second.&#13;
          John's guess on why this happened was that perhaps he wanted&#13;
     to give a counter tilt to the polemical thrust of the Anne Kruger&#13;
     days. Richard's guess was that this was an outcome of the debt&#13;
     issue. Thalwitz felt that both guesses were wrong. Anne was a&#13;
     gadfly but had very little influence inside the Bank - much more&#13;
     outside. For example, she saw south Korea as a citadel of the&#13;
     neoclassical model.&#13;
           The person who, by changing the investment focus, really&#13;
     repositioned the Bank was Ernie Stern. He fashioned a lending&#13;
     instrument that would integrate ~hat wettld in~egre~ the conveyance&#13;
     of capital with intellectual advice. The fact that this came about&#13;
     before Mexico meant that when the crisis hit the Bank already had&#13;
     an instrument. Much energy has been spent on the overlap and&#13;
     interactions between the Bank and the Fund in the last decade but&#13;
     its been really overdone. In 1983 when he was working on Ghana he&#13;
iC   spen# a lot of time thinking of ways to integrate the human&#13;
     resource dimension with long term development - totally "un-&#13;
     Fundish11 concern. This sort of thinking led to the formulation of&#13;
     SECALs. Policy conditionality had always been there in Bank&#13;
     projects but now it became much more overarching. At a recent&#13;
     development committee conference the Dutch proposed the idea of&#13;
     social conditionality with a much wider and deeper array of&#13;
     objectives; only the Indians disagreed.&#13;
          Thalwitz kept referring to the effects of the Budget on the&#13;
     Bank's leadership role - the Board's control on the budget and the&#13;
     consequences of resource constraints in exercising leadership.&#13;
     [Given Thalwitz and Isenmann's referrals to the budget issue it&#13;
     might be important to trace the consequences on the institutions&#13;
     workings of the Board's controlling the budget process since 1985].&#13;
     He also referred very strongly to environmental issues as a case&#13;
     where intellectual leadership was being exercised.&#13;
&amp;#12;                Paul Isenmann pointed to the importance of taking into account   1 l..e:'&lt;)&#13;
           Ernie Stern's AID experiences in interpreting his actions. Another&#13;
           important point to kept in mind was the fundamental change in the&#13;
           role of economics and economists who moved to the helm of the&#13;
           institution. He disagreed with Thalwitz that this change has been&#13;
           all for the better. It has come at the cost of the Bank's technical&#13;
           expertise and with the budget squeeze real choices have to be made&#13;
           between the Bank's economic and technical expertise.&#13;
            Thalwi tz referred to the debt crisis and said that even then -&#13;
       around 1979-80 - there were enough economists in the institution&#13;
       who saw it coming and pointed to it. But at that time the Bank was&#13;
       too much on the sidelines and there was no mechanism that would&#13;
       I&#13;
 I&#13;
       take the information they knew and spread it and share it. He used&#13;
       the example of the Ivory Coast to illustrate his point. A New York&#13;
       banker called up a German counterpart saying they were considering&#13;
  1    lending $50-60 million to the Ivory Coast. Thalwitz happened to be&#13;
  I    there in the office and asked his friend whether the New York&#13;
 /     banker knew that the Ivory Coast had just the previous week being&#13;
 :     negotiating a $2 billion loan from French and Belgian banks for six&#13;
       sugar mills. The New York banker knew nothing of this and promptly&#13;
       withdrew from the loan.&#13;
            There was little coordination even with the advent of aid&#13;
       consortia which should have focused not on giving money but on&#13;
       adjustment policies. In the good old days there was no linkage. The&#13;
       Bank in fact had no lending instrument to do so [it is unclear why&#13;
       the decision not to lend at all is not mentioned as a viable policy ~&#13;
       instrument]. Everyone was big on recycling and were simply not&#13;
       willing to see it. Also because McNamara was taken seriously no one&#13;
&#13;
                                  :r=:&#13;
       wanted to say something that would bring down the house of cards.&#13;
       [reasoning seems somewhat specious - if they were really seeing the&#13;
       inevitable but keeping&#13;
       equally well argue that&#13;
                                       to avoid rocking the boat, one might&#13;
                                  e inevitable, when it did transpire, was&#13;
       even worse] â&#128;¢ The questio was never asked, "Lending, but into what&#13;
       policy context"?         "fttie   1&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In December 1990, Wilfried Thalwitz was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by John Lewis, Richard Webb, Devesh Kapur,
            and Paul Isenman. During his tenure at the Bank from 1963 to
            1995, Mr. Thalwitz worked in the following areas; as a young
            professional (1963-1964); in the projects department as an
            economist for the transport division (1964-1968); in
            Indonesia as a senior transport economist (1968-1970); in
            the western Africa department as division chief (1970-1971);
            in the transportation projects department as a deputy
            director (1971-1972); in the western Africa project
            department as a director (1972-1984); for the West Africa
            region as a vice president (1984-1987); for the Europe,
            Middle East and North Africa (EMENA) region as a vice
            president (1987-1989); in policy, planning and research as a
            senior vice president (1989-1991); and for Europe and the
            Soviet Union as a vice president (1991-1995). His transcript
            concerns his career prior joining the World Bank; his role
            in Planning Commission and the Reserve Bank of India; former
            president Barber Conable's and his conscious and
            deliberate concern with the issue of intellectual
            leadership; and the debt crisis at the World Bank.
