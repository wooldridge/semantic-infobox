            Identifying demand drivers for sanitation
            technologies - the case of Ecosan in Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In identifying demand drivers for
            sanitation technologies, this note describes the case of
            Ecosan - Ecological Sanitation - which has made little
            progress in Africa despite decades of promotion by donors.
            The practical, and environmental benefits of "closing
            the loop", i.e., recycling the nutrients in excreta,
            seem remote to most poor African households. This lack of
            demand for Ecosan, in turn makes many sector practitioners
            question its potential. There are however, a number of
            physical conditions - including high water table, and hard
            rocky ground - which can increase the comparative advantage
            of many forms of Ecosan technology. But beyond these
            physical conditions, there are many factors that influence
            demand by households that need to be considered as well,
            such as the presence of small local operators involved in
            excreta handling. The note examines a number of physical,
            and non-physical "demand drivers" that may
            encourage households to adopt Ecosan solutions. It also
            discusses practical activities within the different segments
            of the "resource loop" and a number of factors,
            beyond the household level, that affect the communal
            adoption of Ecosan, and re-use of excreta.
