3Some versions of RBM terminology use `outcomes' as a wider term, including within it our `impacts' under the name `final outcomes'.&#13;
It is widely recognized that a particular RBM framework needs to be designed for each specific organization, especially one that works by&#13;
partnerships (as emphasized in the undated UNDP document, `Introduction to Results-Based Management; RBM in UNDP: Overview&#13;
and General Principles', which was developed in cooperation with SIDA).&#13;

Continual attention to both content and                                 difficult question of how WSP should distribute its&#13;

17This is a focus area in the 1999-2003 strategy and annual workplans, but the impact of discrete WSP activities is difficult to measure&#13;
because: (i) change may take place in a long timeframe; (ii) changes are unlikely to occur without input from a range of partners, making&#13;
the impact of discrete WSP activities hard to assess; (iii) to be really effective, WSP has to create a sense of real ownership on the part of&#13;
governments, rendering it even more difficult to assess the impact of WSP specifically.&#13;

            External evaluation of the water and
            sanitation program for the period 1999 to 2003 : report
            submitted on June 2004 to the water and sanitation program council
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The water and sanitation program (WSP)
            is an international partnership, set up in 1978, whose
            declared aim is 'to help poor people gain sustained
            access to improved water supply and sanitation'. This
            main report presents the evaluation at global level, for all
            regions and the center. Supported by appendices, it has five
            chapters: Chapter two explains the framework of this
            evaluation, and chapter three describes WSP's work in
            the region. The evaluation of the five-year period is then
            presented in chapter four, which covers the 28 topics
            required by the terms of reference (ToR). Chapter five
            summarizes expected trends and needs in the next few years,
            and recommendations for the future are in chapter six.
            Regional details are presented in four annexes, each of
            which has its own executive summary and appendices.
