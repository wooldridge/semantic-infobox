        <abstracts>
            During the 1990s private sponsors have
            participated in projects involving eighty-nine airports in
            twenty-three developing countries, with investment totaling
            US$5.4 billion. About three-fifths of this investment was
            carried out in 1998 alone, and about two-fifths related to
            the award of the Argentine airport system that year.
            Analysis of the investment patterns shows that Latin America
            leads in attracting private investors, operations and
            management contracts with major capital expenditure have
            been the main vehicle for investment, and governments are
            transferring networks to the private sector more often than
            single airports or stand-alone facilities.
