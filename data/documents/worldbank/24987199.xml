&amp;#12;&amp;#12;WORKING TOWARD SUSTAINABLE WATER&#13;
SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICES FOR ALL&#13;
&#13;
THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Access to sanitation lags behind water. At the aggregate level, the world&#13;
surpassed the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to halve the proportion of&#13;
people without access to improved water supplies by 2015, but failed to meet the&#13;
equivalent for sanitation, and strong country and regional disparities in access remain,&#13;
with Africa and Asia falling behind the rest of the world.&#13;
&#13;
  Quality of service is poor and service providers lack financial resources.&#13;
Intermittent supplies, continuing environmental degradation, and financially weak&#13;
service providers who rely on subsidies to cover their operating and capital costs&#13;
contribute to this challenge.&#13;
&#13;
  Access to a connection is not enough. The Sustainable Development Goals&#13;
(SDGs) aim to build on the global achievements made since 1990. Access continues to&#13;
be important, but SDG 6 proposes a broader agenda, as set out in the draft definition:&#13;
&#13;
      By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.&#13;
&#13;
      By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open&#13;
      defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.&#13;
&#13;
  These new goals reflects the growing importance of water and sanitation as a human&#13;
right. Additional targets that go beyond access are also being considered, such as improving&#13;
water quality by reducing pollution, and substantially increasing water-use efficiency.&#13;
The scale of the challenge is large and becoming more complex. The challenges&#13;
described translate to 663 million people without access to safe water, and 2.4 billion&#13;
people without access to improved sanitation, of which 1 billion defecate in the open.&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;    Two-thirds of people in developing countries use onsite sanitation, but only 22 percent&#13;
    of fecal sludge is managed, whereas up to 90 percent of sewerage flows in developing&#13;
    countries are discharged untreated into water bodies. Moreover, the combined impacts&#13;
    of urbanization and climate change will converge to compound this challenge.&#13;
&#13;
      Future water availability is not guaranteed. Uncertainty about the future&#13;
    availability of water resources will have its most profound effects on poor populations,&#13;
    which are often concentrated in disaster-prone areas such as overcrowded settlements&#13;
    and low-lying deltas. Water variability, whether too much or too little, will strongly&#13;
    impact the ability of providers to maintain adequate quality and quantity of water&#13;
    supply and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
      Failure to address these issues is expensive. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#13;
    estimated the economic cost of poor sanitation at US$260 billion per year, which,&#13;
    depending on the country, can range from 1 to 6 percent of the national GDP.&#13;
    There is no universal solution, but experience suggests the challenge may fall&#13;
    under three broad areas:&#13;
        Â»Â» Governance, the state, and citizen engagement: The framework of&#13;
           behavior change, institutions, policies, and incentives that support or undermine&#13;
           achievement of SDG 6.&#13;
        Â»Â» Finance and pricing: The ability of service providers to fully cover their&#13;
           operations and maintenance costs, and access investment funds as needed to&#13;
           expand and improve services and leverage markets.&#13;
        Â»Â» Capacity: The skills needed by managers and staff to deliver services&#13;
           efficiently and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
9&#13;
&amp;#12;RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Strengthen sector governance, citizen participation, and utilities to&#13;
improve service delivery. Effective service delivery depends not only on the&#13;
governance and finance of service providers, but also on the relationship of the sector with&#13;
the state. Increasingly, water and sanitation services are delivered in the context of a&#13;
multitiered stateâ&#128;&#148;federal or decentralizedâ&#128;&#148;and aligning the water sector in terms&#13;
of roles and responsibilities to the different tiers of government is fundamental to&#13;
creating the right accountability and incentive for making services work, especially&#13;
for poor people.&#13;
&#13;
  In this context, strengthening local governments and their relationship to citizens can&#13;
form an important platform for ensuring universal access to services. The formation&#13;
of effective service providersâ&#128;&#148;whether rural or urban providers, public or private,&#13;
or community-based systemsâ&#128;&#148;requires a framework that enables each tier of the&#13;
state to have formal mechanisms for citizen engagement in service provision.&#13;
Furthermore, the linkage of the water sector to the fiscal, financial, and regulatory&#13;
framework of a multitiered state will also define and set the context for leveraging&#13;
markets and for the private sector to support the delivery of services.&#13;
&#13;
  Similarly, local governments can play a critical role in developing incentives&#13;
for household-level behavior change, which is especially important in the case of&#13;
sanitation. Finally, the linkage between the water sector and the state is critical for scaling&#13;
up service delivery and innovation and delivering on the promise of universal access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;       In terms of the governance of service providers, previous World Bank studies have&#13;
     shown that well-run utilities demonstrate four key characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
         Â»Â»   They are managerially and financially autonomous.&#13;
         Â»Â»   They are accountable to their stakeholders.&#13;
         Â»Â»   They are efficient.&#13;
         Â»Â»   They are customer-oriented.&#13;
&#13;
        Rarely do utilities in developing countries meet these characteristics, even though many&#13;
     best practices are known and replicable throughout the world. Greater separation of&#13;
     roles and responsibilities of sector actors is important, especially through ring fencing&#13;
     and better management of the service provider. There is a need to seek mechanisms&#13;
     for separating policymaking from service delivery and regulationâ&#128;&#148;distinguishing&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;judge from the jury.â&#128;&#157; Interestingly, studies have shown that separation of roles and&#13;
     responsibilities of sector actors is often facilitated and triggered by the separation of&#13;
     roles and responsibilities between different tiers of government, suggesting that water&#13;
     sector governance reforms are intimately linked to the decentralization of the state. In the case&#13;
     of small towns, the need to consolidate into larger, more viable entities may become&#13;
     important. But more than anything, strong political leadership, which sees the benefits&#13;
     of universal and sustainable service delivery, is critical. It is only with this support&#13;
     that better incentives can be introduced, that utilities can be held accountable for the&#13;
     services they deliver, that opposition from vested interests can be withstood,&#13;
     and that customers can expect, and be asked to pay for, a service that meets their needs.&#13;

&#13;
                                   WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
11&#13;
&amp;#12;  Secure a reliable revenue stream sufficient to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. Maintaining revenue remains a day-to-day challenge for many&#13;
utility managers. Data from the International Benchmarking Network for Water&#13;
and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) shows that only 64 percent of the 4,500 utilities in&#13;
the database cover more than their operation and management (O&amp;M) costs from&#13;
user fees. User fees are, in most cases, the most reliable source of revenue given&#13;
that government transfers can be unreliable, or may come with political patronage&#13;
requirements. Increasing reliance on user fees also means that managers and staff will&#13;
focus more of their attention on meeting customer needs, rather than trying to satisfy&#13;
politicians on a day-to-day basis. This requires attention to commercial operations&#13;
(billing and collections), price setting (cost recover tariffs), and the design of tariff&#13;
structures that achieve cost recovery while considering affordability.&#13;
&#13;
  Pricing. Revenue and affordability, however, raises the issue of pricing water.&#13;
Today, in the context of climate change, the world is seeking to put a price on carbon&#13;
but there is uncertainty as to how to value water. Yet, in the context of water security,&#13;
pricing and valuation of water has become essential. Pricing will need to play the role&#13;
of supporting water efficiency and reducing waste; facilitating the allocation of water&#13;
between competing needs such as energy, agriculture, and municipal sectors; creating&#13;
accountability in service delivery; meeting environmental needs; and securing universal&#13;
access and affordability. A single price cannot meet these differing objectives, but no&#13;
pricing or underpricing has the same impactâ&#128;&#148;inefficiency, inequity, and misgovernance.&#13;
Indeed, the most expensive water, especially for the poor, is free water. Time and&#13;
again studies have shown that water subsidies are often captured by the better-off&#13;
households, and poor revenue streams for providers undermine their accountability&#13;
and ability to universalize service delivery, leaving poor households outside the ambit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                            12&#13;
&amp;#12;     of formal service delivery. The Gordian knot of water pricing can only be cut in the&#13;
     context of institutional reform, sector governance, and assurance that the linkage with&#13;
     the state can allow distributional goals to be addressed through effective safety nets&#13;
     financed separately and securely.&#13;
&#13;
       Improve operational efficiency to ensure that each revenue unit&#13;
     delivers the maximum service possible. The two largest areas of inefficiency&#13;
     are typically energy consumption and leakage. In both cases, greater use of&#13;
     performance-based contracting provides service providers with opportunities to&#13;
     leverage their public-sector skills with the technical capacity and incentives of the&#13;
     private sector to reduce costs and improve quality of service.&#13;
&#13;
       Increase and improve access to investment capital. To achieve universal and&#13;
     quality services, investment capital must extend beyond what has historically been available&#13;
     from government grants, subsidies, and loans. The next period must see a move toward&#13;
     mobilization of more domestic capital, whether from banks, capital markets, or other&#13;
     sources such as pensions and insurance companies. Given the limited use of such sources in&#13;
     the past, there is a lot of ground to be made up. Often borrowers and lenders have limited&#13;
     understanding of each otherâ&#128;&#153;s needs and constraints. They simply donâ&#128;&#153;t know how to talk&#13;
     to each other, and there may even be legal constraints that block potential lending to water&#13;
     companies. As a result, extensive capacity building will be needed to create that marketâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
     to build credit-worthy utilities, educate lenders about the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s opportunities, and&#13;
     remove legal or policy obstacles to mobilizing those funds. In the meantime, governments&#13;
     and donors should focus on building infrastructure by providing more results-based&#13;
     financing that creates a mindset around outcomes and institutions. Using government-&#13;
     backed financial institutions to supply finance and compensate for credit worthiness does&#13;
     not have a track record of triggering or sustaining effective service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
                                  WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
13&#13;
&amp;#12;  Increase capacity building of utility staff and managers to&#13;
professionalize the sector. Capacity is often perceived through the lens of&#13;
training, and that too, through a prism of supply-driven, top-down training&#13;
methodologies. Capacity building in reality is much more and, importantly, intimately&#13;
linked to the institutional setup of the service provider. A local government or a&#13;
service provider that has operational flexibility with its own revenue sources and is&#13;
held accountable for service delivery will constantly seek to invest in its own capacity&#13;
through organizational changes, contracting of systems and skills, and, yes, training.&#13;
Capacity building in such a setting becomes more demand driven and related to&#13;
operational needs.&#13;
&#13;
  In this broader institutional context for the water sector, national governments can&#13;
offer resources and incentives for individual utility and service providers to invest in&#13;
capacity building at their level. Both private and public institutions have a role to play,&#13;
and there should be an effort to build upon past successes and develop new partnership&#13;
modalities. For the private sector, there is potential to move from delegated or service&#13;
contracts to larger-scale efforts, such as capacity building at scale for multiple utilities.&#13;
Likewise, public-to-public twinning partnerships can be expanded in both depth and&#13;
scale, as long as they remain founded on key success factors such as shared interests,&#13;
geographic proximity, and cultural and linguistic considerations.&#13;
&#13;
  The World Bank will continue to provide infrastructure financing to support&#13;
clients in their drive to meet the SDGs. This will be balanced by an increasing use of&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s international knowledge and experience to improve service providers by&#13;
linking governance, financing, and capacity building, helping our clients move toward&#13;
universal, quality water and sanitation services in a sustainable manner.&#13;

A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                                14&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER&#13;
&#13;
THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Water stress is growing. Population and economic growth are bumping up&#13;
against a finiteâ&#128;&#148;and increasingly degradedâ&#128;&#148;water resources, and this is particularly&#13;
evident in urban areas. Although the extent and nature of this stress varies from&#13;
area to area and from city to city, many parts of the world will need to manage their&#13;
water resources much more effectively to sustain their growth, and in some cases,&#13;
prevent a major regression in water-derived welfare. Furthermore, with higher rates of&#13;
urbanization, competition between agricultural, industrial, and municipal water uses&#13;
will increase, putting stress on existing water sources, and this will disproportionately&#13;
impact the poor.&#13;
&#13;
  An increasing number of people live in urban areas. Currently, 54 percent&#13;
of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s population (i.e., 3.9 billion people) resides in urban areas; by 2050, 66&#13;
percent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s population is projected to be living in urban areas, with nearly&#13;
90 percent of this increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. Growing cities will&#13;
need to provide services to 70 million more people each year over the next 20 years,&#13;
further increasing the already massive challenge of providing universal access to water&#13;
supply and sanitation (WSS) services by 2030. In this context, growing demand for&#13;
WSS services, accompanied by unplanned land use in urban areas, will likely lead to&#13;
unchecked contamination of surface and groundwater sources. This poses a threat&#13;
to the security of water supplies, increases flood risk, and affects the quality of life of&#13;
urban residents. In particular, small and medium-sized towns and cities experiencing&#13;
high population growth in developing countries will face increasing challenges to&#13;
provide basic urban services as they prepare to become the larger cities of tomorrow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                              16&#13;
&amp;#12;       Urban water management systems are inefficient. Current approaches to&#13;
     urban water management remain sector-specific, lacking scope to address cross-cutting&#13;
     water-related challenges. Watershed approaches to urban water management, where they&#13;
     exist, are rarely well coordinated with urban planning or with the provision of other urban&#13;
     services. Local authorities may also lack information about and experience with available&#13;
     technical options. Thus, approaches to urban water management remain fragmented. As a&#13;
     consequence, variations in the quantity and quality of water available to cities for drinking&#13;
     water, agriculture, energy, industry, and the environment lead to growing water insecurity.&#13;
&#13;
        Climate change affects water resource availability. In addition, urban&#13;
     water management must consider the increased variability in water resource availability&#13;
     stemming from the effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, changes&#13;
     in precipitation patterns, and climate variability. An estimated 150 million people&#13;
     currently live in cities with perennial water shortage; population growth and climate&#13;
     variability may increase this number to 1 billion by 2050. Furthermore, most of the key&#13;
     climate risks are concentrated in urban areas, as high urbanization and rapid growth&#13;
     of large cities are accompanied by an increase in highly vulnerable urban communities&#13;
     living in informal settlements, many of which are on coastal land at high risk from&#13;
     sea-level rise, extreme weather, and climate events.&#13;
&#13;
       The poor are the most vulnerable. The level of vulnerability to the effects&#13;
     of increasing water insecurity and climate change differs across and within cities,&#13;
     and differences in adaptive capacity are to a great extent determined by poverty and&#13;
     inequality, as well as by access to infrastructure, institutions, and information. The urban&#13;
     poor are most vulnerable to these challenges, because they have less access to resources&#13;
     to cope with extreme weather events and are often marginalized from decision making,&#13;
     particularly in the informal settlements of growing urban areas in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER&#13;
17&#13;
&amp;#12;RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Addressing these increasingly urgent challenges requires an array of interventions&#13;
and services at the city level to build resilience not only in physical infrastructure&#13;
but also in citiesâ&#128;&#153; social architecture, governance structures, financial systems, and&#13;
ecosystems. Increasing uncertainties coupled with sudden shocks or accumulating&#13;
stresses could lead to infrastructure failure, economic decline, or social breakdown.&#13;
A resilient city can adapt to a variety of changing conditions and withstand shocks&#13;
while still providing essential services to its residents. Such a city will have a series of&#13;
systems in place capable of absorbing the stresses imposed by climate change as well as&#13;
those resulting from nonclimate risks.&#13;
&#13;
  The World Bank is supporting its client countries in building resilient cities through&#13;
different sectors and approaches. The Water Global Practice of the World Bank is&#13;
contributing to this effort by focusing on three major responses.&#13;
&#13;
   Promote water security by integrating the wider resource perspective.&#13;
This integration is achieved by identifying solutions that take into account resource&#13;
constraints and extreme weather events. It entails broadening the scope of analysis to&#13;
include a basin-wide understanding of the availability of water resources, both surface&#13;
and groundwater, the quantity and quality available, and the existing competing uses.&#13;
It also includes helping clients to navigate the risks and uncertainties from climatic&#13;
and nonclimatic risks, incorporate robustness in system design and operations, and&#13;
strengthen utilities. For example, in Bogota, Colombia, and Buenos Aires, Argentina,&#13;
the Bank is supporting the government through lending instruments to build resilient&#13;
cities through comprehensive upstream watershed management coupled with urban&#13;
water management and flood control.&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                               18&#13;
&amp;#12;       Promote the principles of integrated urban water management.&#13;
     IUWM offers a framework that can complement traditional approaches to resolving&#13;
     the challenges that affect the provision of services in urban areas. It is underpinned&#13;
     by the idea that cities are fundamentally dependent on, and have an impact on, the&#13;
     wider watershed and must account for all elements of the urban water cycle. Under an&#13;
     IUWM approach, planning for the water sector is integrated with other urban sectors,&#13;
     such as land use, housing, energy, and transportation, to overcome urban planning&#13;
     fragmentation with the aim of improving system-wide performance. Within an IUWM&#13;
     framework, it is also important to promote activities that close the water cycle and&#13;
     improve infrastructure design and operation through the incorporation of hard and&#13;
     green solutions (e.g., drainage systems, green roofs, and room for the river).&#13;
&#13;
       In Teresina, Brazil, for example, the World Bank has been providing financing for&#13;
     soft and hard investments to integrate drainage infrastructure with water supply and&#13;
     sanitation, create green areas to mitigate the effects of urban flooding, and regenerate&#13;
     urban areas to promote economic development. Most recently, the World Bank&#13;
     provided support to Uruguay to develop a roadmap for an IUWM national strategy for&#13;
     sustainable urban development and strengthening of local capacities.&#13;
&#13;
        Promote mainstream water in broader city resilience exercises.&#13;
     Several global initiatives on building resilient cities focus on a large number of sectors&#13;
     and servicesâ&#128;&#148;e.g., the Rockefeller Foundationâ&#128;&#153;s 100 Resilient Cities, work by the&#13;
     C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), ICLEI, and the United Nations Human&#13;
     Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). In addition, the World Bank is implementing&#13;
     its City Strength Program. This program facilitates dialogue with city stakeholders&#13;
     about risk, opportunity, and the performance of urban systems, and provides a tool&#13;
     for identifying priority actions and investments to enhance resilience in city systems&#13;
&#13;
                                                          CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER&#13;
19&#13;
&amp;#12;as a whole. The Water Global Practice collaborates with these broader initiatives&#13;
to ensure that resilience is built into water systems, thus providing proper service&#13;
provision and protection of the most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
  Promote decentralized cities. In the context of todayâ&#128;&#153;s urbanization process&#13;
and the growing economic importance of urban systems, the governance framework of&#13;
cities will determine the impact cities will have on the welfare of nations. At the heart&#13;
of the governance story is the extent to which cities have devolved political, fiscal,&#13;
and regulatory powers. South Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s megacities (e.g., Dhaka, Mumbai, and Karachi)&#13;
are relatively centralized, with limited fiscal and policy powers. In contrast, cities in&#13;
Southern Africa and Latin America have more decentralized powers. Importantly, the level&#13;
of decentralization is a critical determinant of how accountable city policymakers&#13;
are to urban citizens. Policies to build resilient cities will therefore be sharply&#13;
influenced by the governance structure of cities and their level of decentralization&#13;
in an intergovernmental system. However, building resilience is equally a national&#13;
responsibility. Therefore, the fiscal and policy relationships between upper tier&#13;
governments and city governments become equally important in the governance of&#13;
cities and supporting programs that strengthen resilience.&#13;
&#13;
  Building resilient cities requires various sectors to work together to ensure integrated&#13;
city-wide planning, including effective water resource management. It also requires&#13;
a careful understanding of the governance system of cities and their place in the&#13;
intergovernmental system. The World Bank will continue to work across sectors&#13;
and with diverse institutions and stakeholders to help cities become resilient for the&#13;
challenges ahead while ensuring decreased vulnerability of the poor and strengthened&#13;
urban governance and accountability.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;TRANSBOUNDARY COOPERATION&#13;
HELPS BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCE&#13;
&#13;
THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  The growing development in transboundary river basins increases&#13;
water-related risks. Around 60 percent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s freshwater flows are in&#13;
transboundary rivers and 40 percent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s population lives in their river basins.&#13;
Globally, there are approximately 276 transboundary river basins; Africa alone has&#13;
63 transboundary basins where the five largest rivers are shared by eight or more&#13;
countries. Managing water-related hazards and risks in transboundary basins will be&#13;
a central challenge in strengthening global resilience to climate change. As demand&#13;
grows, these rivers will become increasingly developed, and pressure on the resource&#13;
base will further complicate the challenges they face on political, institutional,&#13;
economic, and financial fronts.&#13;
&#13;
  Climate change and growing hydrological variability and uncertainty&#13;
in these basins will affect billions of people, particularly the poor.&#13;
Increased uncertainty and shifting crop water requirements will threaten poor rain-fed&#13;
farmers in particular. Moreover, the increasing intensity of droughts, floods, typhoons,&#13;
and monsoons, along with uncertainties around waterborne disease, glacier melt, glacier&#13;
lake outburst floods, and sea-level rise pose the highest risk to poorer communities that are&#13;
least able to cope. For example, in the Niger Basin, the predominantly rural population&#13;
relies on rain-fed agriculture, pastoralism, or other natural-resource-based livelihoods.&#13;
Food security and social well-being depend on unpredictable rainfall patterns that&#13;
are projected to become more extreme as the climate changes. Subsistence economies&#13;
that rely on the environmental services provided by the river are the most vulnerable&#13;
to climate risk. Sound water management, which is key to adaptation, is weakest in the&#13;
poorest countries in the basin, thereby magnifying their climate vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                                22&#13;
&amp;#12;       The transboundary nature of most major rivers, lakes, and aquifers adds&#13;
     complexity to planning and implementing these crucial adaptation and mitigation&#13;
     interventions and may introduce the risk of maladaptation. Countries face&#13;
     technical, financial, political, and logistical challenges when they seek to&#13;
     manage or develop their transboundary watersâ&#128;&#148;challenges that spill over and&#13;
     complicate efforts to build climate resilience and adapt to change. Examples of the&#13;
     complexities of transboundary waters include:&#13;
&#13;
         Â»Â» Hydrological and meteorological boundaries seldom coincide with political&#13;
            boundaries, so national data sets only provide a subset of information needed to&#13;
            characterize available water and project water-related climate vulnerabilities.&#13;
         Â»Â» Political relationships can dominate the extent to which data is shared and&#13;
            investments are explored collaboratively.&#13;
         Â»Â» Competing national priorities for common water resources have different&#13;
            payoffs for different riparians; national-level interventions that do not consider&#13;
            riparian interests risk having maladaptive consequences.&#13;
         Â»Â» Having multiple borrowers and/or multiple beneficiaries adds complexity to&#13;
            institutional and financing arrangements for infrastructure.&#13;
         Â»Â» Coordinating among multiple countries adds time and expense to any process;&#13;
            riparians may become frustrated with the pace of multilateral development and&#13;
            see international cooperation as a hindrance rather than a solution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
23&#13;
&amp;#12;RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Despite its complexities, transboundary cooperation on information, infrastructure,&#13;
and institutions presents countries with an important opportunity to effectively and&#13;
efficiently build climate resilience. The World Bank is supporting its client countries in&#13;
building climate resilience through transboundary cooperation by focusing on three&#13;
major responses.&#13;
&#13;
  Promote cooperation in information and data sharing to reduce uncertainty,&#13;
manage climate risks, and strengthen livelihoods in the face of a changing climate.&#13;
Information needed for resilience-building interventions exceeds geopolitical and&#13;
sectoral boundaries, and transboundary cooperation allows:&#13;
&#13;
    Â»Â» expansion of the information and knowledge base to improve understanding of&#13;
       weather and climate phenomena and increase predictive accuracy.&#13;
    Â»Â» use of available information by countries to collaborate and coordinate in&#13;
       making strategic regional and national decisions in the face of extreme climate&#13;
       variability and unpredictable long-term climate change.&#13;
    Â»Â» effective and efficient dissemination of processed information to populations&#13;
       vulnerable to climate disaster.&#13;
&#13;
  For example, in Central Asia, the World Bank is supporting efforts to strengthen&#13;
national and regional hydrological and meteorological information systems that&#13;
will improve accessibility, reliability, and analytical capacity to use water resource&#13;
information for improved water resource planning, monitoring, and management.&#13;
These systems will help countries reduce uncertainty as they plan for and operate&#13;
hydropower, irrigation, and municipal water supply investments.&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                             24&#13;
&amp;#12;       Promote basin-wide planning and development of strategic natural and&#13;
     man-made infrastructure to mitigate impacts of climate variability and&#13;
     reduce risks of long-term change. Transboundary cooperation allows countries&#13;
     to strategically, in the context of their hydrogeologic landscape, advance sound and&#13;
     sustainable regional and national infrastructure that will equip people to better&#13;
     store, regulate, and exploit their water resources. As a result, these countries will be&#13;
     able to advance their development objectives and reduce their climate-disaster and&#13;
     environmental vulnerability in the face of increasing climate variability and shifting&#13;
     long-term water availability trends. For example, in the Niger Basin, the World Bank&#13;
     contributes to the funding of the Kandadji Program, which involves construction&#13;
     of the Kandadji dam and investments to increase power-generation capacity, boost&#13;
     agribusiness, increase irrigation, and support community development. These investments&#13;
     will help the people of Niger and the basin to overcome their vulnerability to water-&#13;
     related shocks and take steps toward meeting their development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
       Strengthen the range of institutions needed to implement effective&#13;
     cooperative adaptation. Transboundary cooperation allows countries to develop a&#13;
     strong foundational institutional framework, which includes formal legal frameworks;&#13;
     informal, accepted norms; and organizations such as river basin organizations and regional&#13;
     economic commissions. This framework enables effective sharing of information and&#13;
     collaboration on sustainable infrastructure critical to reducing climate disaster risk and&#13;
     mitigating environmental vulnerability. For example, in the Zambezi Basin, the World&#13;
     Bank, through the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program, is&#13;
     supporting the Zambezi Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM) in its effort to develop a&#13;
     basin-wide master plan, a basin-level information platform, and a flood-forecasting and early&#13;
     warning system. A strong ZAMCOM will be an important tool for countries as they work&#13;
     together under an uncertain future to equitably develop the basinâ&#128;&#153;s shrinking resources.&#13;
                                  WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
25&#13;
&amp;#12;WATER AND GENDER&#13;
&#13;
THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  Women lack voice and representation in water management. Since the&#13;
Beijing Platform of Action for the Advancement of Women was defined 20 years ago,&#13;
international policy declarations have stressed the importance of addressing gender&#13;
differences in water needs and have emphasized the central role women play in water&#13;
management to achieve sector goals. Although sector policy and strategies at country&#13;
and institutional levels have registered modest success in consistently channeling&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s contributions, women continue to be disproportionately underrepresented in&#13;
sector decision making at many levels.&#13;
&#13;
  Domestic water collection leads to time poverty for women and girls.&#13;
In spite of the progress realized in the global Millennial Development Goals 2015&#13;
milestone for water, in 70 percent of households in 45 developing countries, domestic&#13;
water collection is done by women and girls, disadvantaging other spheres of life.&#13;
In India, for example, women and girls spend an estimated 150 million work days&#13;
fetching water per year; in Tanzania, school attendance levels are 12 percent lower for&#13;
girls in homes more than an hour away from safe water supply than for girls within a&#13;
distance of 15 minutes.&#13;
&#13;
   Women have unequal economic opportunities. The water sector continues&#13;
to reflect unequal economic opportunities in spite of growth. For example, in&#13;
patriarchal societies, the membership requirement for water user associations&#13;
is often tied to land ownership, which reduces womenâ&#128;&#153;s chances to participate&#13;
in decisions on water resource management. Men benefit disproportionally&#13;
from economic opportunities generated by the capital-intensive nature of water&#13;
development and management.&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                          26&#13;
&amp;#12;       Women and girls have specific sanitation needs. Globally, 52 percent of&#13;
     the female population is of reproductive age. Managing menstruation requires several&#13;
     essential elements, including clean materials to absorb or collect menstrual blood,&#13;
     a private place to change these materials as often as necessary, soap and water for&#13;
     washing, and access to safe and convenient facilities to dispose of used materials.&#13;
     Taboos around menstruation have rendered these needs invisible, but without such&#13;
     facilities or with unisex facilities with no privacy, girls have been known to lose school&#13;
     days or even drop out of school at puberty. Moreover, walking to communal toilets in&#13;
     urban informal settlements or humanitarian camps, or, in the absence of facilities,&#13;
     to secluded areas for open defecation, has been associated with gender-based violence.&#13;
&#13;
     RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
       For water in its multidimensional role in economic development and poverty&#13;
     reduction, addressing gender is essential to achieving quality results. Substantial&#13;
     evidence shows that a gender-inclusive approach increases sustainability. Data from&#13;
     a 2001 World Bank study of 15 countries shows that water supply projects that used&#13;
     gender and demand-responsive approaches, such as separate meetings for women and&#13;
     men, capacity building, and quotas for womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation, sustained their results&#13;
     better and used the services more effectively to promote better health outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
       To respond to the challenges, gender-inclusive water programs need to reflect&#13;
     the integral roles of women and girls as providers, users, and managers of water.&#13;
     In addition, more analysis of qualitative and quantitative data is required.&#13;
     Finally, synergies with other sectors such as health and education as well as&#13;
     stakeholder engagement need to be promoted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
27&#13;
&amp;#12;  The World Bank is supporting its client countries in reducing gender inequities&#13;
through different sectors and approaches. The Water Global Practice of the World&#13;
Bank is contributing to this by focusing on three major responses.&#13;
&#13;
  Increase the institutional space for gender. Sector actors can address&#13;
gender inequality when sector objectives, strategies, institutional arrangements,&#13;
and resources are in alignment with international and national gender goals and&#13;
commitments. To explore the barriers that prevent, as well as the positive factors&#13;
that lead to, effective implementation, the Water Global Practice is undertaking&#13;
a global study to determine if countries have gender-informed water policies and&#13;
strategies, and to what extent they are being implemented. The findings will be used&#13;
to support the development of gender action plans in water for selected countries,&#13;
and at a global level to promote knowledge on creating the institutional space to&#13;
address gender gaps as part of regular water sector development.&#13;
&#13;
  Recently, the government of Papua, New Guinea, with the partnership of the&#13;
World Bank, developed and adopted a gender-informed national water, sanitation,&#13;
and hygiene (WASH) policy that addresses gender dimensions of access, voice, and&#13;
gender-based violence. Built on broad stakeholder engagement with civil society,&#13;
academia, and government, the policy was enacted in January 2015. In this past year,&#13;
the Water Global Practice reviewed the portfolio for trends and good practices in&#13;
addressing gender in the 2000â&#128;&#147;2014 period. The findings are being used to increase&#13;
support of gender in all aspects of water, with increased attention to water resource&#13;
management. Building on the review, the Practice is also preparing new tools and&#13;
checklists to guide staff, clients, and partners in addressing gender as part of sector&#13;
reform and project design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                          28&#13;
&amp;#12;       Promote equal economic opportunities in the water sector.&#13;
     Analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and special interventions are required to ensure&#13;
     that women benefit from the economic opportunities that water generates. Peruâ&#128;&#153;s Sierra&#13;
     Irrigation Project found that 75 percent of the water managers were men, land titles&#13;
     were almost exclusively in menâ&#128;&#153;s names, participation in the Water User Organization&#13;
     (WUO) was linked to land ownership, and meetings were held at times women were&#13;
     unavailable and conducted in Spanish rather than the local language most women knew.&#13;
     Overcoming the challenges required removing the land title requirement for WUO&#13;
     membership and irrigation access, setting aside a portion of irrigated land for women,&#13;
     and, through exposure and training to men and women, raising awareness of womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     role in irrigation management. By the end of the project, all of the WUOs had at least&#13;
     one woman leader and participation in WUO meetings registered at least 30 percent&#13;
     women. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Red River Delta Water and Sanitation Project incorporated training&#13;
     for women on financial literacy, management, and business development, and provided&#13;
     access to credit through rotating funds and credit cooperatives. The intervention enabled&#13;
     women to make increased decisions on and investments in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
       Increase the capacity of the state and service providers to address&#13;
     gender and water. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Service Improvement Project&#13;
     (WASSIP) built capacity within government water boards and 24 urban water utilities to&#13;
     address gender in sector policy and operations. Results included new gender action plans&#13;
     implemented with the institutionsâ&#128;&#153; own resources; reform of access policies such as social&#13;
     connections and adoption of alternatives to land title requirements for water and sewer&#13;
     connections; increase in womenâ&#128;&#153;s opportunities for paid work; and enhanced womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     visibility in utility management. A compilation/toolkit of lessons learned is now being&#13;
     used to guide utilities beyond the project investment area in Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
29&#13;
&amp;#12;  A compilation/toolkit of lessons learned is now being used to guide utilities beyond&#13;
the project investment area in Kenya. At a regional level, platforms like the Africa&#13;
Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Council on Water (AMCOW), which adopted the â&#128;&#156;AMCOW Policy and&#13;
Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Water Sectorâ&#128;&#157; in 2011, provide an&#13;
entry point for countries to learn from one another. Similarly, the Nile Equatorial&#13;
Lakes Subsidiary Action Program established a gender action plan, guidelines, and&#13;
built capacity of riparian government staff for joint monitoring using gender-sensitive&#13;
indicators for transboundary water management.&#13;
&#13;
  Finally, the decentralization of the state and formation of local governments offer a&#13;
space to increase the capacity of the state to address the linkage between gender and&#13;
water. As India has shown, ensuring that local councils have a dedicated portion of&#13;
seats for women councilors has enabled women to leverage their voice into service&#13;
delivery decisions. States such as Kerala and West Bengal have seen this voice reflected&#13;
in greater demand for water services. In Bangladesh, this has translated into greater&#13;
demand for sanitation services. At the same time, water service delivery innovations&#13;
can strengthen the voice of women in state management. The linkage of service&#13;
delivery with the system of the state and mechanisms of voice that make a state&#13;
inclusive are therefore critical to ensuring that the state is able to address the policy&#13;
nexus defined by gender and water and can be held accountable for doing so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                            30&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;ATTRACTING COMMERCIAL FINANCING&#13;
INTO THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
THE CHALLENGES&#13;
   Risky and uncertain revenues impede the water and sanitation&#13;
sector from accessing commercial financing. Delivering good quality&#13;
water and sanitation services requires that service providers be accountable to&#13;
their customers and have financial and managerial autonomy to maintain assets&#13;
and expand investments. Long-term commercial financing is required to support&#13;
infrastructure development while short- and medium-term commercial financing&#13;
is needed to support short- and medium-term rehabilitation, operating expenses,&#13;
and bridge financing. Although both sources of financing are crucial, access to long-&#13;
term financing is particularly difficult in developing countries where risks are high&#13;
and future revenue streams more uncertain. Service providers in many developing&#13;
countries confront the additional risk of foreign exchange rate volatility, which&#13;
increases the cost of borrowing from foreign sources. For them, tapping into long-&#13;
term domestic sources such as pension funds and insurance companies is critical to&#13;
better match revenues and debt services and thus minimize the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
&#13;
  Weak enabling environment discourages investment and results in&#13;
low quality of service. Effective resource mobilization essentially implies that&#13;
governments need to bring to market projects that are of interest to commercial&#13;
financiers and create regulatory certainty. This requires interventions across several&#13;
frontsâ&#128;&#148;lowering risks, creating deeper local financial markets, and mobilizing&#13;
international capital markets and institutional investors. That said, financing for&#13;
projects will be hard to come by if governments do not have a facilitating regulatory&#13;
and institutional framework in place. This means ensuring a service providerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
financial and managerial autonomy to limit day-to-day political interference.&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                         32&#13;
&amp;#12;        It also means accountability to stakeholders, including lenders, who focus on&#13;
     efficient service delivery. Many utilities in developing countries do not yet meet these&#13;
     thresholds, and this poor governance is reflected in poor operational performance with&#13;
     high levels of leakage, endemic inefficiency, and low quality of service. As a result,&#13;
     it is critical to look at sector governance as well as the enabling environment for private&#13;
     financing, both of which tend to be very weak in the water sector.&#13;
&#13;
       Significantly less private capital has been committed to water and&#13;
     sanitation than to other infrastructure sectors. In 2013, private-sector&#13;
     participation in the water and sanitation sector totaled $3.4 billion, or just 7 percent of&#13;
     the money that flowed into energy and information and communications technology&#13;
     (ICT). Perhaps the single biggest constraint relates to the sources of income to&#13;
     support water projects. There are only two revenue streams to support infrastructure&#13;
     investments: consumers and government. However, unlike ICT and energy, where&#13;
     market forces tend to determine these revenue streams, there is often a public&#13;
     perception that water costs to consumers must be kept to a minimum. As a result,&#13;
     water and sanitation services are often underpriced, thus undermining opportunities to&#13;
     develop and maintain infrastructure as well as mobilize commercial finance.&#13;
&#13;

                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
33&#13;
&amp;#12;RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
  As focus shifts to the SDGs and achieving universal access to water and sanitation,&#13;
there will be a need to mobilize private capital to finance the infrastructure.&#13;
To scale up (â&#128;&#156;billions to trillionsâ&#128;&#157;), it will be necessary to reconsider the systems and&#13;
incentives needed to attract and sustain such capital flows. Over the past five years, the&#13;
Global Water Practice at the World Bank has been working with key public and private-&#13;
sector partners in numerous countries to explore innovative financing arrangements.&#13;
There is no â&#128;&#156;one size fits allâ&#128;&#157; and the solutions vary from models of contracting out&#13;
specific services, to full-scale public-private partnerships (PPPs), to mobilizing domestic&#13;
credit. Although much remains to be done, significant achievements have been realized&#13;
in such diverse countries as Bangladesh, Benin, Cambodia, Kenya, and Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
  The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approach is to tailor solutions to the financing,&#13;
development, and delivery challenges of each country and city.&#13;
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam offers a good example. The World Bank supported the&#13;
water utility in outsourcing its leakage operations in part of the city. This project used&#13;
an innovative performance contract where payments to the contractor were contingent&#13;
upon water leakage savings. The saved water could then be used to expand services&#13;
and increase revenues, thus improving both the quality of service and the financial&#13;
performance of the company. Cairo is a booming and vast metropolis where the&#13;
Bank has supported the local private and public sectors in gaining expertise in new&#13;
technologies by partnering with foreign operators with obligations to maintain&#13;
assets. In Senegal and Benin, there has been successful use of private operators&#13;
in rural water with small schemes that are grouped to attract finance and achieve&#13;
economies of scale.&#13;
&#13;
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL&#13;
                                                                                              34&#13;
&amp;#12;       A number of instruments and tools exist to facilitate or â&#128;&#156;crowd-inâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
     commercial financing. Many of these have been used successfully in other&#13;
     infrastructure sectors and, in the right enabling environment and with viable&#13;
     projects, can be used to significantly increase private financing. A host of tools&#13;
     have been used to attract investors to the infrastructure markets. For instance,&#13;
     financial guarantees are used to reduce the risks for private investors and increase&#13;
     the pool of capital. Partial credit guarantees have been structured in multiple&#13;
     ways to share risk and can be tailored to meet specific mitigation needs. They are&#13;
     best used when the capital risk is clear and the guarantee is targeted to overcome&#13;
     the specific risk. Another popular tool is insurance, which can be used to mitigate&#13;
     investor risk and, like guarantees, may be structured to share risk or tailored to&#13;
     address specific issues.&#13;
&#13;
       For example, insurance has been used to mitigate concerns about such diverse&#13;
     challenges as the political economy, and catastrophic circumstances such as&#13;
     natural disasters. Subsidies, when structured correctly, reduce the overall&#13;
     financing costs, target benefits to specific segments of the population, and extend&#13;
     service coverage areas. Equity grants, or blended finance, is another form of subsidy&#13;
     that replaces equity capital with no or low return finance. Other examples include&#13;
     tenure extensions, pooled finance, and project preparation funds. In sum, there are&#13;
     tools to suit particular country circumstances and call for targeted responses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES&#13;
35&#13;
&amp;#12;  Innovative financing can transform marginal projects into&#13;
financially viable transactions. However, no amount of innovation can&#13;
make nonviable projects bankable or overcome lenderâ&#128;&#153;s concerns about sector&#13;
governance, utility performance, and revenue predictability. How public finance and&#13;
public institutions of service delivery are structured will determine the ability of the&#13;
water sector to leverage private finance. Poorly structured public systems will not&#13;
attract private finance or will do so at the risk of creating moral hazard and placing&#13;
commercial risk implicitly on public resources. Without a concerted push to address&#13;
these issues, the chances of achieving the SDGs could be threatened.&#13;

            A water-secure world for all : water for
            development - responding to the challenges
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This new goal reflects the growing
            importance of water and sanitation as a human right.
            Additional targets that go beyond access are also being
            considered, such as improving water quality by reducing
            pollution, and substantially increasing water-use
            efficiency. The scale of the challenge is large and becoming
            more complex. The challenges described translate to 663
            million people without access to safe water, and 2.4 billion
            people without access to improved sanitation, of which 1
            billion defecate in the open. Two-thirds of people in
            developing countries use onsite sanitation, but only 22
            percent of fecal sludge is managed whereas up to 90 percent
            of sewerage flows in developing countries are discharged
            untreated into water bodies. Moreover, the combined impacts
            of urbanization and climate change will converge to compound
            this challenge. In this context, strengthening local
            governments and their relationship to citizens can form an
            important platform for ensuring universal access to
            services. Indeed, the formation of effective service
            providers, whether rural or urban providers, public or
            private, or community based systems, requires a framework
            which enables each tier of the state to have formal
            mechanisms of citizen engagement on service provision.
            Furthermore, the linkage of the water sector to the fiscal,
            financial, and regulatory framework of a multi-tiered state
            will also define and set the context for leveraging markets
            and private sector to support the delivery of services.
