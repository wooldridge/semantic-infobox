        <abstracts>
            Independent power projects typically are
            structured on a project finance basis. Guarantees to the
            lenders result from the project itself rather than from the
            project sponsors. The problem is that lenders are reluctant
            to participate in projects where they are exposed to
            government policy failure risk. The World Bank could play an
            important role in promoting private investment in power by
            helping to overcome this risk problem. The author suggests how.
