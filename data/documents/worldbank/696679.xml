rehabilitation, and incremental recurrent costs. The Project comprises&#13;
four main components:&#13;
(i) Policy Analysis and Management. This component would assist the&#13;
MOH in building up a capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and&#13;
would finance a limited number of key studies such as a burden of&#13;
disease analysis and cost-effectiveness studies. The component would&#13;
also finance computer software and hardware, as well as basic office&#13;
equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of&#13;
Regional Health Centers, as they introduce new methodologies related to&#13;
public health sector restructuring and flexible budgeting, and monitor&#13;
and evaluate the implementation of health sector reforms. The&#13;
component will also finance long-term and short-term fellowships in the&#13;
areas of health planning, management, economics and finance, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
health education and communications, as well as public information&#13;
activities.&#13;
(ii) Primary Health Care. This component will improve the quality and&#13;
scope of primary health care in selected municipalities, which are&#13;
committed to the introduction of the reform of health services delivery&#13;
and financing, and to improve the efficiency of the health sector. The&#13;
component will finance minor rehabilitation, equipment and furniture for&#13;
up to 270 local health centers and 42 polyclinics. It will also finance&#13;
consultant services to assist MOH and Municipal Councils to plan PHC&#13;
activities, design and implement the new package of PHC services and&#13;
training programs for medical doctors, nurses and other health and social&#13;
workers and well targeted municipal health promotion activities.&#13;
(iii) Emergency Medical Services. This component will support ongoing&#13;
efforts by MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve&#13;
the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery, by separating EMS&#13;
functions from those of the PHC network and creating a three-tiered&#13;
national EMS network. The component will finance minor civil works&#13;
for base stations at the periphery and minor civil works and equipment&#13;
for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital and 45&#13;
community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29&#13;
properly equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96&#13;
ambulances for the basic life support teams in the pre-hospital services.&#13;
The component will also finance consultant services to assist in&#13;
completing the conception, in coordinating the implementation, and in&#13;
managing the EMS and in training medical, paramedical and&#13;
administrative staff.&#13;
(iv) Blood Transfusion. This component will assist current efforts to&#13;
improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products by&#13;
restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood transfusion centers,&#13;
by introducing safer and more up to date technology and by promoting&#13;
actively the recruitment of new donors. The component will finance&#13;
minor civil works and equipment to renovate existing facilities of the&#13;
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and&#13;
the five Regional Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia,&#13;
Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora, and Varna. It will also finance&#13;
technical assistance to design programs, and training for health personnel&#13;
engaged in donor recruitment, public relations, blood collection and&#13;
processing, and quality control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- v &#13;
BENEFITS:        The project will have four major benefits. It will: (i) contribute to&#13;
economic growth and increased lifetime income for individuals through&#13;
the impact of improved health status on labor productivity, fewer work&#13;
loss days, a longer working life, increased ability of individuals to obtain&#13;
better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of health and education)&#13;
increased enrollment and improved ability to learn; (ii) reduce poverty&#13;
and improve equity by targeting health interventions to the poor who&#13;
stand to gain the most in economic terms from improvements in health&#13;
status; (iii) increase the efficiency of the health system by focusing on&#13;
health interventions (e.g. preventive and primary) that are known to be&#13;
the most cost effective, i.e., those that yield the greatest gains in&#13;
disability adjusted life years per unit cost (through a decrease in infant,&#13;
maternal and other adult mortality, lower levels of disability associated&#13;
with various degrees of illness), and by improving the institutional&#13;
organization, service delivery, and input utilization of the health sector;&#13;
and, (iv) improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability&#13;
by containing cost escalation in the health sector.&#13;
RISKS:           The most important risk faced by the project lies in the lack of&#13;
experience and weak managerial capabilities of MOH staff engaged in a&#13;
major reform and restructuring program. This risk will be offset by&#13;
building on and expanding ongoing programs which are being&#13;
implemented successfully by other donors and by financing a supporting&#13;
technical assistance and training program. Other risks are linked to the&#13;
country's exceptional conditions. For instance, political uncertainties&#13;
still inhibit the full commitment of some officials to the reform program.&#13;
Moreover, unrealistic expectations are often generated by a&#13;
misconception of Western systems or optimistic views on the time and&#13;
resources required to develop and introduce a specific reform. These&#13;
risks will be somewhat mitigated by financing information activities&#13;
aimed at building a national consensus on health sector reform and&#13;
initiatives to break the isolation of MOH staff and develop professional&#13;
contacts with other Western institutions.&#13;

BULGARIA&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1         Bulgaria began the transition to a market economy with a well developed&#13;
health infrastructure and good health indicators in many respects. However, as economic&#13;
conditions deteriorated, health indicators stopped progressing and even declined in some&#13;
instances. Indicators show a rising infant mortality, rising incidence of tuberculosis,&#13;
epidemics of communicable diseases, decreased availability of blood products, increasing&#13;
incidence of iodine deficiency, and imminent collapse of blood transfusion and hematology.&#13;
As transition to a market-oriented economic and restructuring of the health system are&#13;
medium-term processes, there is a real danger of further deterioration of current trends&#13;
before a new health system performs adequately.&#13;
1.2         In keeping with the transition to a more market-oriented economy, the country&#13;
is moving from a highly centralized, public sector health system toward a more diverse and&#13;
decentralized system in which the private sector is expected to play a crucial--yet still&#13;
indeterminate--role. However, the fast pace of decentralization of the health care delivery&#13;
system and the unregulated emergence of private health care providers pose a real threat to&#13;
the quality of health care. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the medical community are&#13;
wrestling with the most complex and often controversial issues such as the introduction of&#13;
health insurance, the allocation of resources in a decentralized setting and the means to&#13;
encourage greater efficiency and improved quality of health services.&#13;
1.3         The system places a heavy fiscal burden on a country where per capita income&#13;
has fallen from US$2,680 in 1989 to only US$1,160 in 1993. Govemment revenues have&#13;
contracted by 50 percent in real terms since 1989. Despite the loss of revenues, expenditure&#13;
in the health sector was maintained in real terms until 1993, when across the board budget&#13;
cuts were introduced. Nonetheless, the situation remains financially unsustainable, and the&#13;
system needs to adjust to the new fiscal reality. The urgency of reform has been heightened&#13;
by the political, economic and social forces which have come into play during the transition.&#13;
This first project in the health sector in Bulgaria will promote the necessary adjustments in&#13;
the health care system, while at the same time providing urgent investments aimed at&#13;
protecting key health services which are part of the safety net and essential for developing&#13;
the country's human capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
B. Health Status of the Population''&#13;
1.4         Since the 1950s, the health of the population has substantially improved as&#13;
shown by the trends in most health indicators. This improvement, however, has lagged since&#13;
1985 and appears to be reversing itself in the last four or five years. Like many East&#13;
European countries, Bulgaria faces a major challenge in improving the health of its adult&#13;
population, particularly low income groups and minorities.&#13;
1.5         Bulgaria's population of about 9 million is aging rapidly, and is expected to&#13;
remain stable till the end of the century.Y' The crude birth rate (10.0 per thousand) has fallen&#13;
below the replacement level and, since 1990, there have been more deaths than births. Total&#13;
fertility declined from 2.1 to 1.9 live births per woman during the 1965-1990 period. The&#13;
crude death rate (12 per thousand) is on the rise, largely due to the aging of the population.&#13;
The aging process will reduce the 0-14 years age group from 19.9 percent of the total&#13;
population in 1990 to 17.9 percent in 2025; at the same time, the 65 years and above group&#13;
will increase from 13.5 to more than 21 percent.&#13;
1.6         Bulgaria is one of the few developed countries where life expectancy--one of&#13;
the most fundamental indicators of health status--has not increased significantly since 1970.&#13;
Life expectancy at birth for males has actually decreased (68.1 in 1962 and 68.0 in 1992)&#13;
while it increased for women (from 71.7 to 75.0 during the same time period). High rates of&#13;
internal migration have resulted in a 67 percent urbanization rate (46 percent in 1965) and a&#13;
high concentration in rural areas of elderly people who require more services. The health&#13;
status worsened in rural areas, due to lower quality of health services and deteriorating socio-&#13;
economic conditions which especially affect the elderly population. Ethnic minority groups&#13;
also have a poorer health status and less access to basic health care.&#13;
1.7         A review of health indicators shows that infant mortality is high (22nd out of&#13;
27 countries in Europe) and rising from 13.6 per 1,000 in 1988 to 15.9 in 1992. Similarly&#13;
maternal mortality is high (24th out of 27). Among women, besides the high maternal&#13;
mortality, a high standardized death rate (SDR) for cancer of the cervix, a highly preventable&#13;
disease, is noteworthy (21st out of 27). Due to the unavailability of modern contraceptives,&#13;
Bulgaria has one of the highest abortion rates in the world and, since the early 1970s,&#13;
abortions have outnumbered births (1.4 abortions per live birth in 1991). Immunization&#13;
rates, which were among the highest in Europe, have recently decreased. Among children,&#13;
the most frequent causes of death in 1992 were conditions of the perinatal period (29%),&#13;
congenital malformations (26%) and diseases of the respiratory system (24%).&#13;
1' For a more comprehensive analysis see Annex 2: The Health of the Bulgarian Population.&#13;
' The 1992 Census estimated the population at 8.485 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.8          Overall, epidemiological conditions are characteristic of an aging population.&#13;
High mortality is explained by a very high SDR (0-64) for circulatory system diseases (25th&#13;
out of 27), with the highest SDR for cerebrovascular diseases in Europe. Diseases of the&#13;
circulatory system are major contributors to the increasing difference in mortality rates&#13;
between Bulgaria and Western EuropeY  In terms of morbidity, the most frequent reasons&#13;
for seeking health services in 1992 were: diseases of the digestive system (44%); diseases of&#13;
the nervous system (12%); diseases of the locomotion system (7%); diseases of the&#13;
respiratory system (7%); accidents, poisonings and violence (7%). More importantly,&#13;
however, the main causes of hospitalization4' confirm again the high prevalence and&#13;
seriousness of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Bulgaria.&#13;
1.9          Finally, lifestyle is a major factor affecting mortality and morbidity patterns.&#13;
Tobacco consumption is on the rise in the population below 35 (especially in the 11-15 age&#13;
group) and among women and alcohol consumption is relatively high. The percentage of fat&#13;
in the diet, although below European average, is increasing. Finally, mortality from traffic&#13;
accidents and suicide correspond to European averages, but male mortality from injury and&#13;
poisoning is much higher. As in other Eastern European countries environment related&#13;
health problems seem to be concentrated in the most industrialized areas.&#13;
C. Health Care Organization and Financing-'&#13;
1.10         The Bulgarian health system is characteristic of most former socialist&#13;
economies, with: (i) tax-based financing; (ii) public sector provision of services;&#13;
(iii) universal access to comprehensive care; (iv) centralized planning and management;&#13;
(v) extensive infrastructure and staffing; and (vi) few incentives for consumers or providers&#13;
to increase efficiency, control costs and improve the quality of care. The public sector&#13;
health system is organized along the lines of district and municipal administration, and&#13;
consists of: (i) rural health posts, district health centers and urban polyclinics (freestanding&#13;
and hospital-based) for ambulatory care; (ii) municipal hospitals (250-300 beds each) and&#13;
district hospitals (1,000 beds each) for secondary care; and (iii) medical academies and a&#13;
wide variety of specialized hospitals and institutes for tertiary care. The public sector health&#13;
system also includes an extensive, but inefficient and ineffective, network of emergency&#13;
2' In 1991, the age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 population from disease of the&#13;
circulatory system totalled 160.4, as compared to an average of 62.3 for the European Union.&#13;
4' Delivery and pregnancy: 19%; Diseases of the Respiratory System: 17 %; Diseases of the Circulatory&#13;
System: 1 1 %.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
medical services (EMS), as well as a network of regional and district blood transfusion&#13;
centers and district-based Hygiene and Epidemiology Inspectorates (HEIs).&#13;
1.11        In addition, parallel health systems--financed out of general revenues but&#13;
restricted to specific social or occupational groups--are maintained by the Ministries of&#13;
Transport, Interior, Labor and Defense. Private sector health services were authorized in&#13;
1991 and have grown rapidly in the liberalized and largely unregulated pharmaceutical&#13;
sector, prompting the exodus of 40 percent of pharmacists from the public sector. At the&#13;
same time, the development of private medical services has been slowed by, among other&#13;
factors, the lack of an appropriate financing mechanism.&#13;
1.12        The most fundamental reform of the Bulgarian health system to date has been&#13;
the decentralization of management and financing of health facilities to the municipalities in&#13;
which they are located, including district hospitals and district-based, specialized institutes,&#13;
which have catchment areas extending beyond a single municipality. All local health&#13;
facilities have the legal status of municipal enterprises, limiting their managerial and financial&#13;
autonomy. National-level institutes and hospitals have the status of autonomous public&#13;
enterprises--with some falling under the supervision of the MOH. District and municipal&#13;
health services are financed almost exclusively from a municipal budget which is distinct&#13;
from the central, or republican budget. However, the municipal budget is dominated by&#13;
transfers from central budgetary revenues. A key issue following the decentralization of&#13;
health system management has been the need to match resources at the municipal level with&#13;
health care responsibilities, particularly when catchment areas extend beyond a single&#13;
municipality.&#13;
1.13        Despite the unprecedented economic and fiscal contraction, the Government&#13;
succeeded in maintaining--and even moderately increasing--aggregate real spending for health&#13;
during this period until 1992. This is in marked contrast to most other former socialist&#13;
economies, where economic contraction has resulted, to varying degrees, in compression of&#13;
real health expenditures. As a result, public spending for health rose as a share of GDP&#13;
from 3.4 percent in 1989 to a peak of 5.4 percent in 1992--a level which is not high by&#13;
Western European standards, but is in the upper range for countries at Bulgaria's income&#13;
level. Given the magnitude of the fiscal contraction, health expenditures nearly doubled as a&#13;
share of government spending, from 5.8 percent in 1989 to 11.9 percent in 1992. However,&#13;
fiscal pressures made spending cuts inevitable and health expenditures were trimmed to 5.1&#13;
percent of GDP in 1993, and 4.7 of GDP in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. Major Issues for Health Sector Reform&#13;
Breakdown of Essential Health Services&#13;
1.14        Bulgaria is undergoing a difficult transition characterized by severe economic&#13;
dislocations, change from a centrally planned health system to a decentralized one, and an&#13;
attempt to move from a publicly financed and provided health services delivery system to a&#13;
publicly financed but both privately and publicly provided system. In line with the decline in&#13;
health indicators over the last few years, there is increasing evidence that essential services&#13;
have either deteriorated in quality or become too costly to sustain.&#13;
(i) Primary Health Care&#13;
1.15        In Bulgaria, the first point of contact in the public health system--Primary&#13;
Health Care (PHC)--is neither comprehensive, nor clearly differentiated from costly&#13;
emergency medical services. Provision of family medicine through general practitioners&#13;
and/or paramedical practitioners is a new concept. Physicians at the primary level tend to be&#13;
both overspecialized and unfamiliar with some elements of the basic package of PHC&#13;
services, particularly in the areas of disease prevention and health promotion.&#13;
1.16        Maternal and perinatal mortality are very high in Bulgaria due to a number of&#13;
factors such as: the low quality of perinatal care, the lack of appropriate follow up in the&#13;
case of high risk pregnancy, the difficulties in the emergency referral system, the poor&#13;
availability of modem contraceptive services, and the limited availability of blood products.&#13;
Improved management of obstetrical and neonatal care in PHC, with stronger linkage to&#13;
emergency services needs to be developed.&#13;
1.17        With the decentralization of health services, it has become increasingly&#13;
difficult for cash-strapped municipalities to ensure even a minimum level of service. Rapid&#13;
price increases have led to shortages of consumables and restrictions on utilities. Basic&#13;
maintenance of facilities and equipment is often not ensured. Lack of financial incentives&#13;
and essential supplies has demotivated medical staff, who have migrated toward the hospital&#13;
sector, leaving 1,400 positions vacant at the primary level. As a result, patients tend to&#13;
bypass the primary system, seeking less cost-effective treatment in hospitals.&#13;
1.18        The economic transition has intensified the need for comprehensive reform of&#13;
the health system. At the primary level, measures have been undertaken to train general&#13;
practitioners, as well as establish the legal and regulatory framework, and define new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
reimbursement mechanisms, for private sector providers. Private outpatient services,&#13;
particularly for family medicine, are slowly emerging.6'&#13;
1.19        However, the public sector will continue to have an important role to play--&#13;
particularly in poorer, more isolated municipalities--in maintaining a minimum PHC network.&#13;
Maintaining this network, as part of the public sector social safety net, is crucial during the&#13;
economic transition, but also beyond, as evidence shows in well-established market&#13;
economies in Western Europe and elsewhere. If the public sector in Bulgaria is to fulfill its&#13;
responsibility to provide this key component of the social safety net, reforms in the structure,&#13;
scope and organization of primary health services are called for. Investments tightly linked&#13;
to measures aimed at improving the utilization of existing facilities and improving the&#13;
efficiency of services are also necessary.&#13;
(ii) Emergency Medical Services&#13;
1.20        Emergency medical services (EMS) play a pivotal role, allowing the&#13;
population direct access to critical care for life-threatening and other emergency situations.&#13;
They also link the PHC sector to more specialized levels of services, through organized&#13;
communication and transport. Beyond the usual response to, management and transport of&#13;
real emergencies, EMS in Bulgaria provide house calls and transport for routine non-&#13;
emergency care. These services could be handled more effectively and more efficiently by a&#13;
public or private PHC.&#13;
1.21        In a country where cardiovascular diseases and accidents are leading causes of&#13;
mortality, EMS are provided by a fragmented network of pre-hospital and hospital&#13;
institutions with no clear definition of responsibilities and linkages. No national standards&#13;
for the organization, financing, or quality of care of EMS are enforced. The low quality and&#13;
the inefficiency of the services provided has become even more obvious with the&#13;
decentralization of health care delivery and with the limitations of municipal budgets.&#13;
1.22        There is no separation between primary care and emergency services, and&#13;
emergency medical teams, both in mobile units and in health centers and small hospitals, de&#13;
facto cater in most cases (up to 85%) to a family practice type of demand, and handle few&#13;
critical emergencies. This vertical separation of clinical services leads to expensive&#13;
duplication. The concept of a unified, polyvalent emergency room does not exist, and&#13;
transfers to specialized services are not controlled.&#13;
1.23        The system is generously staffed, although the training of medical and non-&#13;
medical personnel is inappropriate. In large cities, pre-hospital medical teams are&#13;
overspecialized, as are most medical teams on call in hospitals. Non-medical staff and&#13;
9' The MOH estimated that at the end of 1993, some 1,000 private practices had opened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
medical teams in rural areas do not have the training required for handling simple emergency&#13;
cases. Finally, the system operates with a large, run down, ineffective fleet of ambulances&#13;
and other vehicles which frequently, as mentioned above, provide transport for elective, non-&#13;
urgent, and even convenience-based reasons.z'&#13;
1.24         The MOH has already undertaken to restructure and streamline the EMS&#13;
through the creation of a nation-wide, well-coordinated EMS network under national rather&#13;
than municipal jurisdiction. The introduction of the new system is expected to permit the&#13;
provision of quality EMS while operating with a significantly reduced number of vehicles&#13;
(about 450) and fewer, but appropriately-trained staff. A national consensus on reform was&#13;
reached through a consultative process between health professionals and municipal leaders.&#13;
The MOH has already received financial support from EU PHARE for the first phase of the&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
(iii) Blood Transfusion&#13;
1.25         The sector of transfusion is a vital element of any public heath care delivery&#13;
system. However, the present status of blood transfusion in Bulgaria does not meet basic&#13;
criteria such as an adequate supply of high quality blood and blood components, or ensure&#13;
adequate safety for blood donors and recipients.&#13;
1.26         The current technology for blood collection and processing is out-of-date and&#13;
presents a great hazard for transmission of infectious agents to both patients and health&#13;
personnel. The utilization of glass bottles as containers limits the volume of donated blood.&#13;
A simple switch to collection in plastic bags will increase the amount of blood collected from&#13;
the same number of donors by 12,000 liters and extend the shelf life by 24 days (i.e., will&#13;
decrease the amount of out-dated blood and increase the availability of blood components for&#13;
transfusion).&#13;
1.27         Improper processing and storage reduces the yield and activity of plasma&#13;
components such as antihemophilic globulin. Moreover, the utilization of glass bottles for&#13;
blood collection does not permit preparation of purified blood components such as&#13;
leukocyte-free red blood cells and platelets. This in turn eliminates the possibility of proper&#13;
treatment for patients undergoing chemotherapy for bone marrow or solid cancer.&#13;
Z' The fleet includes some 2,800 ambulances and cars. Virtually no investments have been made since&#13;
the 1970s and a large number of vehicles should be written off.&#13;
1/ The volume of blood collected in a glass bottle is 340 ml, as compared to 400 ml with plastic bag.&#13;
The shelf life of refrigerated blood collected in glass bottles is 21 days compared to 45 days for blood&#13;
collected in plastic bags.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.28        Most transfusion equipment is obsolete and the situation is rapidly&#13;
deteriorating due to the lack of spare parts. Identification of donors and tests are handwritten,&#13;
increasing the risks of errors. Tests for hepatitis, which are too costly, are not performed.&#13;
Because of the lack of appropriate training, transfusion hematology does not comply with&#13;
international standards. For example, the main product which is transfused is whole blood.&#13;
This contradicts international standards and leads to loss of plasma which otherwise could be&#13;
used for fractionation and production of plasma components.&#13;
1.29        The network of transfusion centers is highly inefficient and needs to be&#13;
restructured. The current system comprises the National Center of Clinical and Transfusion&#13;
Hematology (NCCTH), 4 Regional Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) and 28&#13;
District Transfusion Centers. These centers are currently under the administrative and&#13;
financial control of municipalities, which makes it difficult to implement national policies and&#13;
enforce standards. Each district center is engaged in blood collection and rudimentary blood&#13;
processing, while blood banks exist in the major hospitals and in some regional hospitals. A&#13;
restructuring of this network and downsizing of institutions could lead to significant&#13;
efficiency gains.&#13;
1.30        Finally, the political, economic and social changes during the recent years&#13;
have had an extremely negative impact on blood donation. Incentives provided to donors&#13;
through the work place have all but disappeared, and as in other countries, there is a&#13;
reluctance on the part of the population to donate blood. The total number of donors&#13;
decreased from 44,000 in 1988 to 24,000 in 1992. A strategy to increase the number of&#13;
donors needs to be designed which involves all the major partners, including NGOs such as&#13;
the Bulgarian Red Cross, and an aggressive public information campaign must be supported.&#13;
Limited Emphasis on Health Promotion&#13;
1.31        Health promotion, including disease prevention, is recognized as one of the&#13;
most cost-effective approaches for reducing the incidence of many acute and chronic&#13;
diseases. Because health promotion has been largely ignored as an element in Bulgaria's&#13;
public health strategy, the population has access to insufficient and/or outdated information&#13;
on the relationships between lifestyle and health.&#13;
1.32        SDRs for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria are among&#13;
the nighest in the world and rising, along with those for diabetes, cirrhosis, and cancers of&#13;
the lung, breast and digestive organs. The role which lifestyle factors play in increasing the&#13;
morbidity and premature mortality from these chronic diseases is well-established. These&#13;
factors are most prevalent in industrialized countries, and Bulgaria is no exception with a&#13;
relatively high-fat, high-sodium diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and widespread abuse of cigarettes&#13;
and alcohol. Cigarette smoking continues to rise--especially among young adults--increasing&#13;
manyfold the relative risk of not only lung cancer, but also cardiovascular disease.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Inefficient Allocation and Utilization of Resources&#13;
1.33        The public health care delivery system, generously endowed with physical&#13;
facilities and staff, is characterized by widespread inefficiency. With 3.1 physicians and&#13;
12.3 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants, and a primary care center for every 2,400&#13;
inhabitants, Bulgaria has medical staffing and service capacity which are at the high end of&#13;
the range for both Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and countries with&#13;
established market economies. The existence of parallel delivery systems, maintained by&#13;
other Ministries such as the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Transports makes it also&#13;
difficult for MOH to control investments in the sector. This system places a heavy fiscal&#13;
burden on a country where per capita income and government revenues have contracted&#13;
significantly over a very short period of time.&#13;
1.34        Tax-based health systems such as Bulgaria's offer the advantages of facilitating&#13;
universal access to care and minimizing financial risk for health care consumers. However,&#13;
budget allocations to facilities are based largely on historical levels of fixed and quasi-fixed&#13;
inputs: number of facilities, beds and staff. Allocations do not reflect anticipated service&#13;
volume, nor have they been adjusted to take into account shifting patterns of service&#13;
utilization in recent years. As a result, the existing budgetary system suffers from: (i) few&#13;
incentives for cost consciousness among consumers, who pay no out-of-pocket costs for care;&#13;
(ii) no transfer of financial risk (or reward) to providers in order to create incentives to&#13;
improve efficiency, consolidate redundant services and improve quality to attract clientele;&#13;
and (iii) no reimbursement mechanism for private services which will foster private sector&#13;
development.&#13;
1.35        It is clear that inefficient allocation of resources is limiting the effectiveness of&#13;
the system in preventing and reversing recent declines in health status. Increased efficiency&#13;
in resource use is necessary to enhance both the effectiveness of the system in protecting the&#13;
health of the population, and its fiscal sustainability. In the absence of more fundamental&#13;
financial reform, the Ministries of Health and Finance have sought to improve the existing&#13;
system of municipal budgeting by developing "objective criteria" to determine municipal&#13;
transfers. However, the methodology is applied to only a small share (11 percent in 1994)&#13;
of aggregate municipal transfers, resulting in little reallocation of resources relative to the&#13;
past. Facility and personnel norms have also been established to guide restructuring, but are&#13;
not based on an analysis of service utilization either in Bulgaria or in other countries.&#13;
1.36        In the longer run, adoption of contributory national health insurance legislation&#13;
has tended to be viewed as a panacea for health financing and management problems.&#13;
However, the draft legislation which was submitted to Parliament fails to take into account&#13;
the extremely limited scope for additional payroll taxation as a source of new revenues. It&#13;
also does not define specific reimbursement mechanisms. Some type of contracting between&#13;
providers and insurers is assumed, and yet the development of new reimbursement&#13;
mechanisms which will determine the incentives for increased efficiency, improved quality of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
care and development of private health services. Without first defining these reimbursement&#13;
mechanisms, it is difficult to assess the impact of introducing health insurance on the demand&#13;
and supply of services, and on public spending for health.&#13;
1.37        Legitimate concerns about uncontrolled cost escalation--particularly at a time&#13;
of severe fiscal austerity--have reduced the political urgency of adopting health insurance&#13;
legislation. In the meantime, the National Center for Health Informatics (NCHI) and the&#13;
National Insurance Research and Development Center (NIRDC) have begun to develop&#13;
necessary accounting systems and define and test new reimbursement mechanisms for health&#13;
services. For the past few years, the NCHI has introduced simple cost accounting (by ward&#13;
and by expenditure category) in municipal and district hospitals and polyclinics to&#13;
complement patient and utilization data traditionally collected for the health information&#13;
system. While the financial accounting system is in an early phase--with associated problems&#13;
of data reliability and data processing capabilities--it does provide a sufficient basis for&#13;
calculating average costs, developing simple, cost-based reimbursement mechanisms and&#13;
making efficiency comparisons.&#13;
1.38        The MOH intends to carry out pilot activities to improve district resource&#13;
allocation, by using existing financial and service utilization data to: (i) identify the potential&#13;
for streamlining public health services; and (ii) develop reimbursement mechanisms which&#13;
create financial incentives for efficient resource allocation. These pilot activities will&#13;
require changes in the relationship between the municipal government and health facilities.&#13;
A draft proposal has been prepared and submitted to Parliament to test a number of&#13;
contracting systems between health facilities and municipalities (in an initial stage) and&#13;
among health facilities, the proposed health insurance administration, and municipalities or&#13;
client groups (in a later stage). Such systems will require, inter alia, change in the legal&#13;
status of health facilities and development of more sophisticated cost parameters on which to&#13;
base reimbursement.&#13;
1.39        Building on the work of the NCHI, the NIRDC has outlined a medium-term&#13;
strategy to introduce a case-mix, diagnosis-related approach to hospital reimbursement,&#13;
based on grouping of patients according to ICD-9 categories. Successful implementation will&#13;
require refinement of the cost accounting system, strengthening of financial analysis, and&#13;
development of more complex administrative mechanisms.&#13;
1.40        Further measures are necessary to: (i) determine priorities for resource&#13;
allocation based on Bulgaria's disease profile; (ii) define an action plan to streamline and&#13;
rationalize the public health system, and facilitate the development of private sector&#13;
providers; (iii) improve financial management, diversify sources of revenue; and (iv) develop&#13;
new reimbursement mechanisms for outpatient care, particularly to strengthen primary care&#13;
and support the emergence of private sector general practitioners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Government Strategy in the Health Sector&#13;
1.41        Over the past few years, the Government has started to introduce a number of&#13;
reforms aimed at improving the quality of health care and promoting new financing&#13;
arrangements. First, legislation was enacted to allow private practice for physicians, dentists&#13;
and pharmacists. Second, the health care delivery system has been decentralized with&#13;
municipalities assuming major responsibility for the management of health facilities. Third,&#13;
enrollments in medical schools have been limited, and new programs are being developed, in&#13;
particular with regard to the training of general practitioners. Finally, legislation has been&#13;
prepared for the introduction a national health insurance scheme. The thrust of the reform&#13;
program is to establish the basis for a mixed system of health care delivery, funded in large&#13;
part through a contributory health insurance scheme, the main characteristics of which are&#13;
still being debated.&#13;
1.42        More recently, the Government has defined the main orientations of a&#13;
comprehensive reform strategy for the health sector. The main building blocks of this policy&#13;
framework, as they appear in a Policy Statement of the Ministry of Health, provided in&#13;
Annex 4, are: (i) streamlining the network of public health facilities, through a&#13;
reorganization of health services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels;&#13;
(ii) restructuring and strengthening essential public health services such as primary care,&#13;
emergency care and blood transfusion; (iii) developing financing mechanisms which will&#13;
provide incentives for cost containment and quality of care with a view to prepare the&#13;
introduction of the national health insurance scheme in the medium term; (iv) eliminating&#13;
bottlenecks in the supply of critical inputs, especially drugs; and (v) reforming the medical&#13;
profession with regard to training, working conditions and remuneration.&#13;
1.43        These are a few of the reform initiatives currently being considered or&#13;
underway. While largely positive, they need to be further refined and integrated in a&#13;
comprehensive strategy for health system reform, around which a national consensus must be&#13;
developed. The MOH has requested assistance from WHO EURO to define a new strategy&#13;
for health care. Over the next few years, a tremendous effort will be needed on the part of&#13;
the MOH, research institutes, and the medical community to define detailed objectives,&#13;
analyze policy options, recommend reforms, formulate implementation strategies, and&#13;
educate the public, government officials and lawmakers on policy options and&#13;
recommendations. In particular, the MOH, with overall responsibility for development and&#13;
implementation of health policy, has a formidable task ahead in linking strategic options to&#13;
agreed objectives, and building a national consensus through public awareness and social&#13;
marketing of proposed reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
F. Bank Lending Strategy and Experience&#13;
1.44        Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bulgaria faces the challenge of adapting its&#13;
health care delivery system to the new requirements of a country in transition. While the&#13;
Government has clearly identified the most important policy changes, up to now it has not&#13;
been able to translate them into concrete programs and investments. As a result, very little&#13;
restructuring has taken place over the past three years. The proposed investments will assist&#13;
the MOH in structuring its approach through support of key reforms in primary health care,&#13;
emergency services and blood transfusion, which are the main pillars of modem medicine,&#13;
and will initiate longer-term reforms in health care organization and financing.&#13;
1.45        The Bank has assumed a leading role in helping Bulgaria in the transition to a&#13;
market economy and in foreign assistance coordination. The Bank's strategy in the social&#13;
sectors is to support the development of policies and programs aimed at ensuring both a&#13;
fiscally viable social safety net and the reorientation of the country's human capital&#13;
production systems to the new requirements of democratic and market economies.&#13;
Continuing access to quality health care, especially by underprivileged groups, at an&#13;
acceptable cost to the individual and the community, is an essential element of the social&#13;
safety net, providing ample justification for Bank's involvement in this sector. Moreover,&#13;
the Bank can mobilize and apply significant expertise for the restructuring of the health&#13;
sector and its adjustment to the fiscal contraction.&#13;
1.46        Bank Lending in the Social Sectors. The Bank's initial economic work in&#13;
Bulgaria included a preliminary review of the situation in health sector.9' The Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan,'-' the Bank's first lending operation in Bulgaria, provided for several&#13;
consultancies in the health sector. The Bank prepared internally a development strategy for&#13;
the social sectors in early 1992 (which was presented in 1993 at the Bulgaria Consultative&#13;
Group meeting), designed to ensure that these sectors will play a constructive role in the&#13;
process of transformation to the market economy. The strategy focusses on the development&#13;
of an affordable and targeted social safety net with minimal adverse labor market incentives,&#13;
and of improved human capital to support the transition to a market economy. It provided&#13;
for the development of investment projects, dealing respectively with education, employment&#13;
and social protection, and health.&#13;
1.47        The proposed Project is consistent with the draft Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) -- both of which are being presented to the Executive Directors simultaneously. It&#13;
will promote the necessary adjustments in the health care system, while at the same time&#13;

providing urgent investments aimed at protecting key health services which are part of the&#13;
safety net and are essential for developing the country's human capital. Moreover, the&#13;
reforms introduced through the project support a more rational utilization of resources,&#13;
reducing the risk of fiscal explosion in the social sectors. The present project also builds on&#13;
knowledge derived from ongoing projects in the sector and in the region, most notably in&#13;
Poland, Hungary and Romania. It also builds on assistance already being provided in&#13;
Bulgaria by EU PHARE.&#13;
G. Aid Coordination&#13;
1.48        Support from other donors is generally focused on technical assistance in a&#13;
wide range of programs. WHO plays a significant role in advising the MOH on public&#13;
health strategies in general and on health promotion and health prevention in particular. The&#13;
MOH has already received significant assistance from the European Union. In March 1992,&#13;
EU PHARE committed 15 million ECU for upgrading emergency medical services, training&#13;
general practitioners, and providing technical assistance in the area of health insurance and&#13;
drug policy. In May 1993, EU PHARE provided another 10.5 million ECU for follow up&#13;
activities in the area of health insurance, training of health personnel as well as preventive&#13;
medicine and private medical practice. The implementation of these programs has been&#13;
satisfactory, and the Bank has received significant assistance from the EU PHARE project&#13;
coordinating unit in the course of the preparation of this project. Moreover, the proposed&#13;
project complements the investments made by EU PHARE.&#13;

II. THE FRO.lECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1         The overall objective of the project is to prevent further deterioration in the&#13;
health status of the population, while at the same time improving the efficiency of the health&#13;
care delivery system. More specifically the objectives of the project are to: (i) facilitate the&#13;
restructuring of the health sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management&#13;
capacity in the sector; and (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable groups in&#13;
particular--by ensuring continuing provision of essential health services during the transition&#13;
period and beyond.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.2         The Project will provide specialist advisory assistance, overseas and local&#13;
training, study visits, consumables, equipment, computer hardware and software, facilities&#13;
rehabilitation, and incremental recurrent expenditures (US$41.3 million equivalent base cost,&#13;
and US$47.1 million equivalent including contingencies, taxes and duties). It will be&#13;
implemented over a period of five years by the MOH and concemed Municipalities. The&#13;
proposed Project consists of the following four components:&#13;
A. Policy Analysis and Management&#13;
B. Primary Health Care&#13;
C. Emergency Medical Services&#13;
D. Blood Transfusion&#13;
Policy Analvsis and Management (US$2.5 million, base cost)&#13;
2.3         The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity of the MOH and&#13;
health institutions to analyze policy options, implement the National Health Strategy Action&#13;
Plan developed jointly with WHO, manage health resources, and disseminate information&#13;
about proposed reforms to lawmakers, decision-makers and the public. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the Government finalized a Health Policy Statement (Annex 4), summarizing&#13;
the main policy directions for the health sector, and incorporating the views of both the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. (Annex 4). Specifically, the component&#13;
will support MOH and its associated institutions in their efforts to: (i) de.termine priorities for&#13;
resource allocation based on Bulgaria's disease profile; (ii) define an action plan to&#13;
streamline and rationalize the public sector health system; and (iii) improve financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
management, diversify sources of revenue, and develop new reimbursement mechanisms for&#13;
health services.&#13;
2.4         The component will finance long-term and short-term fellowships to&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the MOH and associated institutions to implement reform strategies&#13;
in the areas of: (i) health planning and health system management; (ii) health economics and&#13;
finance; (iii) health education and communications; and (iv) pharmaceutical policy and the&#13;
economics of the pharmaceutical market. Several fellowship candidates will serve as core&#13;
members of a strengthened Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) in the MOH. The EAU will be a&#13;
technical unit to assist the MOH in analyzing policy options related to health finance,&#13;
resource allocation and expenditures. It will also be a locus for organizing and disseminating&#13;
information, in order to build broad consensus on health policy reforms and health system&#13;
restructuring. Fellowship candidates from five national health institutes will also form a&#13;
technical team to assist local authorities in defining regional restructuring plans for the public&#13;
sector health system. In addition to fellowships, several study tours will be organized to&#13;
allow technicians and policy-makers to assess implementation of health reforms in other&#13;
countries.&#13;
2.5         Short-term local training programs will also be developed under this&#13;
component. Training will focus on building capacity for health planning and health system&#13;
management among MOH personnel, regional and municipal health administrators and&#13;
hospital directors. Fellowship candidates will serve as a core team of trainers for carrying&#13;
out short-term seminars nationwide.&#13;
2.6         The component will also finance consultant services to strengthen capacity for&#13;
analysis and implementation of reform. A Health Finance Advisor will provide long-term&#13;
support to the Economic Analysis Unit in carrying out its functions. In addition, short-term&#13;
consulting services will be provided to support a limited number of policy studies/exercises:&#13;
(i)    a study on priorities for health will be carried out to examine the burden of&#13;
disease in Bulgaria and its implications on public spending in the health sector;&#13;
(ii)  an exercise will be carried out to define restructuring programs for the public&#13;
sector health system in two pilot regions, and develop a methodology which&#13;
can subsequently be applied in other regions, with assistance from the national&#13;
technical team described above. The exercise will rely on cost and utilization&#13;
data deriving from the pilot cost accounting system introduced over the past&#13;
three years;&#13;
(iii) pilot activities will be continued to test a methodology for flexible budgeting of&#13;
health facilities through contracting arrangements between municipalities and&#13;
the facilities explicitly linking budget allocations to service volume. Flexible&#13;
budgeting through contracting will be the first step toward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
longer-term development of a case-mix diagnosis-related reimbursement&#13;
mechanism for health services; and&#13;
(iv) a study will be carried out to determine the financial implications of alternative&#13;
packages for health services to be covered by the proposed health insurance&#13;
system.&#13;
2.7         The component will also finance computer software and hardware. as well as&#13;
basic office equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of Regional&#13;
Health Centers. Strengthening the data processing capabilities in Regional Health Centers is&#13;
essential for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of health sector reforms. It will&#13;
be critical for applying the methodologies developed under the regional restructuring and&#13;
flexible budgeting exercises (see above) on a nationwide basis during the project&#13;
implementation period. Municipalities will be required to make a commitment to adopt these&#13;
methodologies and resulting recommendations in order to benefit from investments in&#13;
primary health care under the project.&#13;
2.8         The Policy Analysis and Management component will also support information&#13;
activities to build a national consensus on health sector reform. On the basis of the Policy&#13;
Statement prepared by MOH, the National Strategy for Health Care (developed with the&#13;
support of WHO) and the burden of disease analysis supported under the project, the&#13;
Economic Analysis Unit will prepare public information documents which summarize policy&#13;
orientations in the sector, priorities for allocation of resources, major issues for reform,&#13;
measures underway to address these issues and the plan of action to define and implement&#13;
further reforms. These documents will provide the basis for information campaigns--through&#13;
seminars, conferences, press releases, etc.--targeted at lawmakers, government decision-&#13;
makers and the public.&#13;
2.9         Finally, this component will finance office equipment, one vehicle and the&#13;
operating costs, including expenses for field monitoring and supervision, for the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU), as well as technical assistance and training for procurement,&#13;
record-keeping and auditing for both the PCU and the Department of Equipment (DEQ).&#13;
2.10        During negotiations the MOH confirmed that:&#13;
(i)  the Economic Analysis Unit in the MOH will be staffed with four full-time,&#13;
gualified health policy analysts (no later than June 30. 1996) (para. 5. 1; and&#13;
(ii)  an annual review of the health sector budget, including assessment of the&#13;
priority public investment program (domestically- and externally-funded&#13;
projects) for health, will be conducted jointly with the Bank. in order to ensure&#13;
resource reallocation in line with priorities stated in the Health Policy&#13;
Statement. (para. 5.1).&#13;

PrimarY Health Care (US$14.5 million, base cost)&#13;
2.11         The objective of this component is to improve the quality and scope of primary&#13;
health care in selected municipalities which are committed to the reform of health services&#13;
delivery and financing, and efficiency improvement through better utilization of available&#13;
resources and existing facilities. This will allow emergency medical services to be&#13;
discharged of PHC responsibilities, particularly for home visits, and set the stage for&#13;
progressive introduction of changes in public/private delivery of services.&#13;
2.12         To achieve these objectives, the project will support the implementation of a&#13;
package of essential PHC services in up to 75 municipalities in the 7 districts (Phase 1) and&#13;
14 Districts (Phase 2) to be covered by the emergency medical services. This package will&#13;
include : (i) basic, high quality, round-the-clock curative care targeted at the most common&#13;
health complaints and delivered to the whole municipal population; (ii) preventive care in the&#13;
area of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) including family planning, maternal and perinatal&#13;
care, infant growth monitoring and immunization; particular attention will also be given to&#13;
screening for cervical, and possibly breast, cancer; (iii) other preventive activities&#13;
implemented in accordance with national health policies, in particular cardio-vascular&#13;
diseases, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and&#13;
accidents; (iv) municipal health promotion activities to address priority problems (tobacco,&#13;
drugs and alcohol abuse, injuries and poisonings, dietary habits, abortion) mainly through the&#13;
promotion of better life-styles.&#13;
2.13         The project will facilitate, through provision of TA to selected municipalities,&#13;
the preparation and implementation of specific plans aimed at improving the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of the PHC network. These plans will pay specific attention to under-served&#13;
areas and seek a better distribution of human, financial and physical resources. Plans will&#13;
address the issues of improvement of quality of services as well as full time coverage of the&#13;
population. In the municipal plans, priority will be given to health units located in difficult&#13;
or remote areas as well as the infrastructure essential for the implementation of the main&#13;
PHC programs at the municipal level.&#13;
2.14         The project will target up to 75 municipalities located in 21 districts and&#13;
selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) commitment to the proposed reform and&#13;
readiness to introduce the standard PHC package designed under the project; (ii) priority to&#13;
under-privileged, low-income areas within the selected municipalities; (iii) willingness to&#13;
downsize their health care delivery system; (iv) agreement to financially participate in the&#13;
project in particular with regard to rehabilitation and furnishing of PHC centers, and&#13;
remuneration of staff providing 24-hour coverage; (v) agreement to allocate vehicles to the&#13;
structures for home visits; and (vi) willingness to utilize suitable buildings, with acceptable&#13;
standards of water, electricity and heating systems. Activities will be launched in the first&#13;
year in the seven Districts already selected (Pleven, Plovdiv, Varna, Dobrich, Pazardjik,&#13;
Shumen, Smoljan). The remaining fourteen Districts will be phased in during year 3 of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Project (Lovetch, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Haskovo, Kardjali, Russe, Montana,&#13;
Targovishte, Stara Zagora, Razgrad, Silistra, Vidin, Vratza, Blagoevgrad).&#13;
2.15        The project will finance minor rehabilitation for up to 270 local health centers&#13;
and 42 polyclinics, equipment and furniture for these facilities. It will also finance technical&#13;
assistance to: (i) assist MOH and Municipal Councils to plan PHC activities, design and&#13;
implement the new package of PHC services (focusing on quality of care, efficiency,&#13;
organization of 24-hour service, and health promotion) and evaluate its impact; and (ii) help&#13;
prepare curricula and programs for re-training medical doctors, nurses and other health and&#13;
social workers; (iii) develop and implement well targeted municipal health promotion&#13;
activities. Contractual agreements, defining the rights and obligations of the respective&#13;
parties, and be signed between the Municipalities and the MOH.&#13;
2.16        Finally, the project will finance training and continuing education programs to&#13;
enhance the skills of PHC personnel working in the municipalities, including: (i) PHC&#13;
physicians, with the collaboration inter alia of the four Training Centers for General&#13;
Practitioners supported by the EU PHARE program; (ii) midwives, nurses and other health&#13;
and social workers in the PHC sector, with the collaboration of local nursing and social work&#13;
schools; and (iii) a limited number of fellowships and study tours in key PHC areas.&#13;
Periodic seminars and/or workshops for information and exchange of experience gained by&#13;
local health authorities will also be organized.&#13;
2.17        During negotiations. the Government confirmed:&#13;
(i)   that contractual agreements will be signed between Municipalities and the&#13;
MOH. for the purpose of implementing the PHC component (no later than&#13;
December 31. 1996) (para. 5. 1); and&#13;
(ii)  the MOH Primary Health Care Unit will be strengthened with two additional&#13;
full time professionals, to assist in the implementation of the primary health&#13;
care component (no later than June 30. 1996) (para. 5.1).&#13;
Emergency Medical Services (US$13.3 million, base cost)&#13;
2.18        The objective of this component is to support ongoing efforts by MOH to&#13;
restructure emergency medical services (EMS) and improve the effectiveness and efficiency&#13;
of service delivery. It also aims at improving the interface between EMS and primary health&#13;
care services, and hospitals.&#13;
2.19        An effective and efficient EMS system is characterized by: (a) rapid access by&#13;
the population and by primary health care staff to a national telecommunications network that&#13;
can process calls, counsel or refer the caller, or promptly dispatch either advanced medical&#13;
response tearns or basic life support ambulances; (b) rapid, efficient, on-site treatment and if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
required, transport without delay to an appropriate health care institution; (c) properly&#13;
equipped, multidisciplinary and multifunctional emergency rooms in the appropriate&#13;
community or district hospital; and (d) medical staff with specialized training in the treatment&#13;
of the full range of clinical emergencies, and with the support from well-trained paramedical&#13;
staff.&#13;
2.20        The restructuring of EMS supported under the project will: (i) separate the&#13;
functions of EMS from those of the PHC network, while ensuring continuous access to&#13;
medical care for the population; (ii) consolidate and effectively manage a three-tier national&#13;
network, which permits the coordination of service delivery and streamlining of patient&#13;
transfer mechanisms; (iii) improve pre-hospital outreach capacity through the efficient use of&#13;
a two-tier fleet of vehicles with adequately trained advanced and basic-level emergency&#13;
teams; (iv) introduce the concept of a multidisciplinary emergency room in order to optimize&#13;
efficiency in receiving and stabilizing acute cases; and (v) build the capacity of the system to&#13;
monitor its own performance.&#13;
2.21        The MOH has adopted a gradual approach to restructuring of the EMS&#13;
network. Under the proposed project a total of 21 Districts will be covered. Decrees of the&#13;
Council of Ministers were passed in February 1994, September 1994, and October 1995,&#13;
introducing the new system in the concemed districts. Detailed regulations defining the&#13;
structure and functions of the system were issued by the MOH in May 1994. Initial support&#13;
for this program is being provided by EU-PHARE, which is financing the national&#13;
telecommunications network, some vehicles, equipment and technical assistance, as well as&#13;
training. Implementation has already started in the first 14 districts, and protocols which&#13;
specify the assets and staff being transferred from Municipalities to the MOH have been&#13;
signed.&#13;
2.22        The project will finance minor civil works for base stations at the periphery&#13;
and minor civil works and equipment for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital&#13;
and 45 community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29 properly&#13;
equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96 ambulances for the basic life&#13;
support teams in the pre-hospital services (provided on the basis of one new vehicle for two&#13;
non-functioning vehicles being written off).&#13;
2.23        The project will also finance consultant services to support the EMS unit&#13;
within the MOH Department of Specialized Health Care (DSHC) in completing the&#13;
conception, coordinating the implementation, and managing the EMS. In addition, technical&#13;
assistance will support the conception and implementation, at the national and district levels,&#13;
of a computerized monitoring system of clinical, operational, and financial data to assess the&#13;
system's performance. Finally, training of medical, paramedical and administrative staff and&#13;
drivers, and special training in emergency medicine for PHC physicians in the periphery will&#13;
be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2.24        During negotiations. the Govemment confirmed that:&#13;
(i)   protocols. which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the&#13;
creation of the National Emergency Medical Services will be signed between&#13;
the MOH and the remaining Municipalities (no later than December 31. 1996)&#13;
(para. 5.1!; and&#13;
(ii)  for every new vehicle purchased for emergency medical services under the&#13;
proposed component, two non-functioning emergency vehicles will be written&#13;
off (para. 5.1).&#13;
Blood Transfusion (US$10.6 million, base cost)&#13;
2.25        The objective of this component is to improve the supply and quality of blood&#13;
and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood transfusion&#13;
centers, introducing safer and more up-to-date technology, and promoting the recruitment&#13;
of new donors.&#13;
2.26        The project will assist the MOH in re-centralizing the system of blood&#13;
transfusion and hematology, thereby concentrating the main blood processing and quality&#13;
control activities in only four Regional Transfusion Centers. This will allow a downsizing of&#13;
the network, with smaller centers performing only blood collection functions, and other&#13;
functions gradually being phased out. It will support the introduction of more up-to-date and&#13;
safer technology for blood collection and processing, and upgrade blood processing to current&#13;
standards of Council of Europe and other international organizations. Finally, the National&#13;
Donor Recruitment Program will be reorganized with the participation of non-governmental&#13;
organizations.&#13;
2.27        The project will finance minor civil works to renovate existing facilities of the&#13;
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and the five Regional&#13;
Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora, and&#13;
Varna. Before negotiations, the MOH presented a physical survey, undertaken by qualified&#13;
engineers/architects, of the facilities to be upgraded under this component and provided cost&#13;
estimates for civil works. The component will also finance the provision of modem&#13;
equipment consistent with Council of Europe standards, as well as consultant services, and&#13;
state-of-the-art materials and mass media campaigns to reorganize the blood donor&#13;
recruitment program. Finally, training programs for health personnel engaged in donor&#13;
recruitment, public relations, blood collection and processing, and quality control will be&#13;
provided for in addition to overseas fellowships.&#13;
2.28        The MOH has already started the implementation of the proposed strategy by&#13;
financing, from its own budget, the provision of plastic bags for the entire network.&#13;
Moreover, in March 1994, the Parliament passed the Law for Blood Donation and for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
use of Blood and Blood Components. The MOH has passed a decree, transferring the&#13;
responsibility for blood transfusion and hematology from the Municipalities to the MOH.&#13;
Protocols, specifying the assets and the staff being transferred from the concerned&#13;
municipalities to the MOH, will also be signed.&#13;
2.29        During negotiations. the Government confirmed that:&#13;
protocols, which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the&#13;
creation of National Blood Transfusion Service will be signed between the&#13;
MOH and the concerned Municipalities (no later than December 31, 1996)&#13;
(para. 5.1).&#13;
C. Project Economic Justification&#13;
2.30        The project will have three major benefits. It will: (i) improve health status;&#13;
(ii) improve equity and reduce poverty; (iii) increase efficiency in the health sector; and&#13;
(iv) improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability by containing cost&#13;
escalation in the health sector.&#13;
2.31        Improve Health Status. Improvements in health status will contribute to&#13;
economic growth and increased life time income for individuals through the impact of&#13;
improved health status on labor productivity, fewer work loss days, a longer working life,&#13;
increased ability of individuals to obtain better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of&#13;
health and education) increased enrollment and improved ability to learn.&#13;
2.32        Current health outcomes in Bulgaria are amongst the lowest in Europe. In&#13;
marked contrast to international trends, life expectancy has actually declined over the past 25&#13;
years as a result of premature death from chronic diseases associated with unhealthy life&#13;
styles. Life expectancy for males, in particular, has declined between 1960 and 1992. Adult&#13;
mortality rates from cardio-vascular disease are the second highest in Europe while mortality&#13;
rates from cerebro-vascular disease are the highest in the region. Infant mortality rates are&#13;
the sixth highest in Europe and the long-term downward trend has worsened during the&#13;
transition. This is due, in part, to the re-emergence of infectious diseases. The country has&#13;
recently gone through major measles (1992) and tuberculosis (1990) epidemics. Maternal&#13;
mortality rates are third highest in the region, while mortality from cervical cancer have been&#13;
increasing and are the seventh highest in Europe.&#13;
2.33        The project will improve health status by the most cost effective method:&#13;
strengthening preventive and curative care at the primary level to address the leading causes&#13;
of high mortality rates in infants, children and adults. The primary health care component&#13;
will improve the quality and availability of matemal and child health care, a cost effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
way to reduce pre-natal problems, acute respiratory infections and other infectious and&#13;
parasitic diseases which are the leading cause of infant death. Increased access to selected&#13;
services for family planning and improved pregnancy related care (pre-natal, child,&#13;
post-partum) also included in the primary health care component should reduce the&#13;
prevalence of unsafe abortions, as well as inadequacies in pre-natal and post-partum care, the&#13;
emergency referral system, and the management of high risk pregnancies, the main factors&#13;
contributing to high maternal mortality rates. High female mortality rates from cervical&#13;
cancer will be addressed through cost effective cervical screening procedures. High and&#13;
increasing adult mortality rates, mainly the result of cardio- and cerebro-vascular disease,&#13;
will be reduced through interventions such as the provision of nutrition information and&#13;
health promotion efforts geared to reduce high-fat diets, tobacco and alcohol consumption-&#13;
leading risk factors for these diseases in adults. Health promotion efforts aimed at accident&#13;
prevention should also reduce accidents, the leading cause of death among children 1-14&#13;
years of age. Improvements in immunization services (also a part of the primary health care&#13;
component) will stem the decline in immunization rates and reduce negative externalities&#13;
from infectious diseases.&#13;
2.34        Improvements in the quality and quantity of blood, a critical part of the blood&#13;
services component, will also have direct impact on improving health status by reducing the&#13;
negative externalities from communicable diseases (i.e., STD, hepatitis B). Shifting the&#13;
focus of emergency services away from routine care to emergency cases, a major objective&#13;
of the emergency services component, should reduce maternal, infant and adult mortality&#13;
rates by decreasing the response time to cardio-vascular and ischemic problems, accidents,&#13;
and complications arising from high risk pregnancies. Interventions in emergency care and&#13;
blood supply systems will provide complementary inputs critical to an effective health care&#13;
delivery system.&#13;
2.35        Improve Equity and Reduce Poverty. The primary health care component of&#13;
the project will identify low income areas as a criterion for site selection for the delivery of&#13;
the primary health care package. Bulgaria has higher poverty rates in rural areas, which are&#13;
under-served by health services. These areas have a greater incidence of the four leading&#13;
causes of both infant and child mortality (congenital malformation, pre-natal problems (only&#13;
infant), respiratory disease, infectious and parasitic diseases) relative to urban areas, and&#13;
therefore stand to gain the most in economic terms from improvements in health status.&#13;
2.36        Increase Efficiency in the Health Sector. Increasing the emphasis on health&#13;
promotion activities and most importantly, improving the quality and scope of the existing&#13;
primary health care network in order to reduce substitution towards expensive tertiary care,&#13;
will increase the efficiency in the health sector.&#13;
2.37        The project will also generate efficiency gains in the health sector by&#13;
restructuring emergency medical services and blood transfusion and haematology services,&#13;
currently two extremely inefficient inputs in the health care system. Streamlining and de-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
linking of costly emergency services from the primary health package (in the emergency&#13;
medical services component), down-sizing and consolidation of the network of blood&#13;
transfusion and haematology centers (by consolidating the network into five regional centers&#13;
and phasing out other functions at the prephery (in the blood services component) should&#13;
improve service delivery and input utilization of the health sector.&#13;
2.38        Improving the policy analysis and management capability of the health sector&#13;
will yield efficiency gains by improving financial management and reallocating health sector&#13;
resources based on burden of disease analysis. The policy analysis and management&#13;
component supports the develpment and implementation of District Restructuring Plans which&#13;
will result in the consolidation of the public sector health network and reduction of excess&#13;
capacity.&#13;
2.39        Improve Fiscal Balance. The project supports the development of new&#13;
reimbursement mechanisms which will create incentives for efficiency and cost containment,&#13;
as well as promote private sector entry into the health care market. The policy component of&#13;
the project will provide support for assessing the financial implications of alternative&#13;
packages for health services to be covered by the proposed health insurance system and into&#13;
alternative sources of revenue (rather than payroll tax increases) to support this sytem. This&#13;
study will assist the Government in selecting a national health insurance scheme--a&#13;
mechanism that would reduce risk and promote economic welfare--on efficiency and&#13;
budgetary grounds. This would avoid the potential escalation of health costs from the&#13;
provision of health insurance, thereby averting an adverse impact on fiscal balance and&#13;
macro-economic stability.&#13;
D. Environmental ImDact&#13;
2.40        No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the project (screening&#13;
category C). Particular attention has been paid in project design to ensure adequate disposal&#13;
of sanitary, medical and laboratory waste. The Project has been classified as C: "No&#13;
appreciable environmental impact."&#13;

A. Introduction&#13;
3.1            This chapter summarizes the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which is&#13;
attached as Annex 1. The PIP describes the operational details for implementing the Project&#13;
and outlines the project content, its inputs, costs and financing plan, disbursements,&#13;
implementation and coordination responsibilities, procurement arrangements, and reporting,&#13;
performance monitoring and evaluation procedures. The PIP was prepared at appraisal and&#13;
updated during negotiations and reflects detailed implementation arrangements agreed with&#13;
the Ministry of Health (MOH).&#13;
B. Project Cost&#13;
3.2            The total cost of the Health Sector Restructuring Project is estimated at 5.3&#13;
billion Bulgaria Leva or US$47.1 million equivalent including contingencies, taxes and&#13;
duties. The base cost is estimated at about US$41.3 million. Physical contingencies amount&#13;
to US$3.4 million, and price contingencies between negotiations (November 1995) and the&#13;
end of the five year project implementation period are estimated at US$2.5 million. Total&#13;
contingencies (US$5.9 million) represent 14 percent of the base cost. The direct and indirect&#13;
foreign exchange component of the Project is estimated at US$30.5 million, including&#13;
contingencies, or 65 percent of total project cost. Taxes and duties on goods and works are&#13;
estimated at US$4.2 million equivalent. Technical assistance expenditures will be tax&#13;
exempt. The Project cost summary by component is shown below in Table 3.1.&#13;

C. Project Financin&#13;
3.4           The Project will be financed by a Bank Loan of US$26.0 million, a Grant&#13;
from EU PHARE of US$2.3 million equivalent, a Loan from the Council of Europe Social&#13;
Development Fund (CEF) of US$11.0 million equivalent, and counterpart funds from the&#13;
Bulgarian Government equivalent to US$7.8 million. The proposed Bank Loan of US$26.0&#13;
million will finance 85 percent of the direct and indirect foreign exchange. Total Bank&#13;
financing will represent about 61 percent of total project cost net of taxes. For risk&#13;
management considerations, the Government selected a currency pool loan for this Project.&#13;
The Government has already obtained the EU PHARE Grant, and intends to sign a separate&#13;
loan agreement with CEF for the CEF Loan. All duties and taxes under the Project will be&#13;
financed by the Government. A Japan Grant of US$500,000 equivalent was made available&#13;
to contract critical specialist services and procure equipment necessary for project&#13;
preparation. The financing arrangements are shown in Table 3.2 below.&#13;
3.5           As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan. all conditions to th&#13;
effectiveness of the CEF Loan, other than the effectiveness of the Bank Loan, will be met.&#13;

vehicles and equipment for hematology centers. No incremental costs from additional staffing is foreseen.&#13;
Averaged over five years, the yearly requirement represents less than one percent of the projected 1994&#13;
total Government budget for the health sector and is deemed sustainable.&#13;

D. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.6         The MOH will have overall responsibility for the implementation of the&#13;
Project. The Project has been designed to fit the implementation and absorptive capacity of&#13;
the MOH. From the operational point of view, and in line with the Project's capacity&#13;
building objectives, the Project wilL be implemented by MOH line departments, sector&#13;
institutions, and health care units in the municipalities, assisted by qualified specialists as&#13;
necessary. Day-to-day coordination of Project-related activities will be the responsibility of&#13;
the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the MOH.&#13;
3.7         A Project Coordination Committee (PCC)L' has been established within MOH&#13;
to oversee project implementation, provide guidance and advice to the PMU, and to ensure&#13;
that project objectives remain consistent with national health policy and priorities. Chaired&#13;
by the Minister of Health, the PCC includes the heads of the PMU, MOH Departments and&#13;
sector institutions involved in the Project, and representatives of the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
The PMU will have overall responsibility for procurement, will coordinate with the MOH&#13;
Department of Construction for the procurement of civil works rehabilitation and upgrading,&#13;
and with the MOH Economic and Finance Department for the procurement of goods&#13;
(equipment, vehicles, materials). The PMU will be responsible for the management of&#13;
project funds. Staffing of the PMU include a Project Director, Deputy Director to&#13;
coordinate the technical assistance program, Procurement Officer, Financial Officer, and&#13;
support staff.&#13;
3.8         During negotiations the MOH confirmed that:&#13;
(i)   the PCC will be maintained throughout project implementation (para. 5.1): and&#13;
(ii)  the Director of the PMU and four full-time staff will be maintained throughout&#13;
proiect implementation with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para.&#13;
E. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.9         Goods procured under the Project will be grouped into major packages to&#13;
encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk procurement. The Bank has prepared&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents which will be adapted for the Project's specific requirements.&#13;
Procurement of goods will be in accordance with the January 1995 Bank Guidelines -&#13;

Procurement of civil works and furniture contracts which are to be financed by CEF will be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and CEF.&#13;
Procurement of technical assistance, equipment and materials under the Policy Analysis Sub-&#13;
Component of Component 1, which will be financed by EU PHARE, will be contracted in&#13;
accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and EU PHARE. Items of&#13;
recurrent expenditure, which will be financed entirely by the Government, will be contracted&#13;
in accordance with regular Government procedures. The major procurement categories&#13;
include: about US$16.3 million of contracts for goods and vehicles awarded through&#13;
international competitive bidding procedures; US$2.5 million through international shopping;&#13;
and US$6.0 million from UNICEF (medical supplies and basic medical equipment for&#13;
primary health care); and US$300,000 through direct contracting (books, software,&#13;
intellectual property). Contracts for technical assistance, fellowships, preparation of studies&#13;
and training programs will amount to about US$3.3 million in the aggregate. The&#13;
procurement arrangements and responsibilities, packaging of bids, as well as the contract&#13;
review requirements under the Project are described in detail in the PIP. The procurement&#13;
arrangements under the Project are shown below in Table 3.3.&#13;
F. Disbursements. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.10        Disbursements. The Project is the first Bank operation in the human&#13;
resources sector in Bulgaria, and therefore, the country disbursement profile is speculative.&#13;
The Project has been designed within the capacity of MOH to execute over a five-year&#13;
period, and Loan funds are expected to be fully disbursed within five and one-half years of&#13;
Board Approval. The Closing Date will be December 31, 2001. The disbursement plan is&#13;
shown in Table 9 of the PIP.&#13;
3.11        Disbursements for goods under contracts below US$200,000 equivalent and&#13;
technical assistance and training contracts below US$50,000 equivalent would be made&#13;
against a certified Statement of Expenditures (SOE) for which appropriate documents would&#13;
be retained by the implementing agency. Disbursements for contracts above these limits&#13;
would be made on the basis of full documentation. The required supporting documentation&#13;
will be retained by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be&#13;
made available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request.&#13;
3.12        Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Government will&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special&#13;
Account for the Project. The Special Account will be denominated in US Dollars and&#13;

will be US$500,000. Upon receipt'of the Government request, the Bank will deposit into the&#13;
Special Account an initial amount of US$250,000. When the aggregate amount of&#13;
disbursements reaches US$2.0 million, the amount deposited in the Special Account will be&#13;
increased to the full authorized allocation of US$500,000.&#13;
3.13        Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982). The Government will provide the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year, an audit report of such scope and detail as the&#13;
Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified SOEs.&#13;
G. Project Reporting. Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
3.14        The PMU will prepare semi-annual progress reports (beginning from the date&#13;
of Loan Effectiveness) on each project component, objective and activity describing:&#13;
(a) current status and issues; (b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan and project&#13;
targets; and (c) recommendations for actions and forward planning.&#13;
3.15        Mid-Term Review and Evaluation. By December 31, 1998, the PMIU will&#13;
undertake jointly with the Bank a mid-term review of progress in project implementation to&#13;
determine whether: (a) the Project's intended objectives remain valid; (b) implementation is&#13;
advancing satisfactorily to justify its continued implementation; and (c) any adjustments to,&#13;
or significant restructuring of, the Project are necessary to improve its effectiveness.&#13;
3.16        During negotiations. the Government provided assurances that a mid-term&#13;
iroEject review will be conducted in accordance with terms of reference (TORl agreed with&#13;
the Bank (no later than December 31, 1998) (para. 5.1).&#13;
3.17        Project Completion and Evaluation. Project implementation is expected to&#13;
be completed within five years by June 30, 2001. The PMU will be responsible for&#13;
preparing a Project Implementation Completion Report to be submitted to the Bank by June&#13;
30, 2002.&#13;
3.18        Bank Supervision. Because this is the first Bank-financed project in the&#13;
health sector in Bulgaria, the Project will require intensive supervision (25 staff weeks each&#13;
year) during the first two years of implementation. - The basis of Bank supervision will be the&#13;
semi-annual progress reports and the PIP. These will be supplemented by a review of&#13;
project expenditures and availability of financial resources, and discussions with technical&#13;
&#13;

assistance groups implementing/assisting in the implementation of various components as well&#13;
as with senior management of MOH and the Government.&#13;
H. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.19        The status of preparation is as follows: (a) The PCC and the PMU have been&#13;
established; (b) coordination and implementation responsibilities of the PMU and MOH line&#13;
departments involved in project implementation have been defined; (c) TORs for the first&#13;
year technical assistance requirements have been prepared; (d) Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
for works, equipment and consultant services have been prepared with Bank assistance for&#13;
Bank-financed projects in Bulgaria, and will be modified by the PMU to suit the project's&#13;
requirements. Equipment lists and detailed technical specifications have been prepared for&#13;
most components; and (e) preliminary architectural designs for the Blood Transfusion&#13;
Centers have been completed, and bidding documents are being finalized.&#13;

IV. BENEFIT AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
4.1          The project will have four major benefits. It will: (i) contribute to economic&#13;
growth and increased lifetime income for individuals through the impact of improved health&#13;
status on labor productivity, fewer work loss days, a longer working life, increased ability of&#13;
individuals to obtain better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of health and&#13;
education) increased enrollment and improved ability to learn; (ii) reduce poverty and&#13;
improve equity by targeting health interventions to the poor who stand to gain the most in&#13;
economic terms from improvements in health status; (iii) increase the efficiency of the health&#13;
system by focusing on health interventions (e.g. preventive and primary) that are known to&#13;
be the most cost effective, i.e., those that yield the greatest gains in disability adjusted life&#13;
years per unit cost (through a decrease in infant, maternal and other adult mortality, lower&#13;
levels of disability associated with various degrees of illness), and by improving the&#13;
institutional organization, service delivery, and input utilization of the health sector; and, (iv)&#13;
improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability by containing cost escalation in&#13;
the health sector.&#13;
Risks&#13;
4.2         The most important risk faced by the project lies in the lack of experience and&#13;
weak managerial capabilities of MOH staff engaged in a major reform and restructuring&#13;
program. This risk will be offset by building on and expanding ongoing programs which are&#13;
being implemented successfully by other donors and by financing a supporting technical&#13;
assistance and training program. Other risks are linked to the country's exceptional&#13;
conditions. For instance, political uncertainties still inhibit the full commitment of some&#13;
officials to the reform program. Moreover, unrealistic expectations are often generated by a&#13;
misperception of Western systems or optimistic views on the time and resources required to&#13;
develop and introduce a specific reform. These risks will be somewhat mitigated by&#13;
financing information activities aimed at building a national consensus on health sector&#13;
reform and initiatives to break the isolation of MOH staff and develop professional contacts&#13;
with other Westem institutions.&#13;

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Assurances Provided at Negotiations&#13;
5.1         During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:&#13;
(a)   the Economic Analysis Unit in the MOH will be staffed with four full-time,&#13;
qualified health policy analysts (no later than June 30, 1996) (para. 2.10);&#13;
(b)   an annual review of the health sector budget, including assessment of the&#13;
priority public investment program (domestically- and externally-funded&#13;
projects) for health, will be conducted jointly with the Bank, in order to ensure&#13;
resource reallocation in line with priorities stated in the Health Policy&#13;
Statement. (para. 2.10);&#13;
(c)   contractual agreements will be signed between Municipalities and the MOH,&#13;
for the purpose of implementing the PHC component (no later than December&#13;
31, 1996) (para. 2.17);&#13;
(d)   the MOH Primary Health Care Unit will be strengthened with two additional&#13;
full time professionals, to assist in the implementation of the primary health&#13;
care component (no later than June 30, 1996) (para. 2.17);&#13;
(e)   protocols, which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the&#13;
creation of the National Emergency Medical Services will be signed between&#13;
the MOH and the remaining Municipalities (no later than December 31, 1996)&#13;
(para. 2.24);&#13;
(f)   for every new vehicle purchased for emergency medical services under the&#13;
proposed component, two non-functioning emergency vehicles will be written&#13;
off (para. 2.24);&#13;
(g)   protocols, which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the&#13;
creation of National Blood Transfusion Service will be signed between the&#13;
MOH and the concerned Municipalities (no later than December 31, 1996)&#13;
(para. 2.29);&#13;
(h)   the Project Coordination Committee will be maintained throughout project&#13;
implementation (para. 3.8);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(i)   the Director of the PMU and four full-time staff will be maintained throughout&#13;
project implementation with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para.&#13;
3.8);&#13;
(j)   a mid-term project review will be conducted in accordance with TORs agreed&#13;
with the Bank (no later than December 31, 1998) (para.3.16).&#13;
Condition of Effectiveness&#13;
5.3         As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan, all conditions to the&#13;
effectiveness of the the CEF Loan, other than the effectiveness of the Bank Loan, namely&#13;
signing and ratification by the Parliament, would be met (para. 3.5)&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
5.4         Subject to the above, the proposed operation provides a suitable basis for a&#13;
loan of US$26.0 million to the Govemment of Bulgaria.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
1.         Introduction. This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is based on findings of&#13;
the Bank appraisal mission of October 1994 and reflects the agreements with the Borrower&#13;
during negotiations in November 1995. The PIP summarizes the operational details for&#13;
implementing the Health Sector Restructuring Project and outlines: (a) the project content&#13;
and inputs; (b) project costs and financing plan; (c) implementation and coordination&#13;
responsibilities; (d) procurement arrangements; and (e) implementation, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation procedures and processes. The Project's operational details are described more&#13;
fully in the Project Operational Manual (POM) which is being finalized by the sector&#13;
institutions involved in the Project under the coordination of the Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) established in the Ministry of Health (MOH).&#13;
2.          Project Operational Manual. The POM constitutes the implementation&#13;
guidelines, performance and outcome monitoring tools for each of the four components of the&#13;
Project. Each of the four sections serves as a complete operational manual for a project&#13;
component, and includes detailed information and relevant documents developed at the&#13;
various stages of project preparation and at appraisal. Each section describes, among others,&#13;
(a) the relevant technical background, objectives, and scope of the component; (b) project&#13;
inputs (works, goods, services, operational and maintenance needs, etc.); (c) terms of&#13;
reference (TOR) for consulting services, studies and training programs; (d) implementation&#13;
schedules and charts; (e) implementation procedures (procurement, execution of tasks,&#13;
expenditure and accounting of resources used, reporting, etc); (f) formats for bidding and&#13;
contractual documents; (g) responsibilities of relevant implementing institutions and decision-&#13;
making matrices; (h) performance targets and monitoring indicators; and (i) detailed cost&#13;
estimates, periodic budgetary requirements, and financing arrangements. The outline of the&#13;
POM is shown in Appendix 1.&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Scope&#13;
3.          The Project aims to prevent further deterioration in the health status of the&#13;
population, while at the same time improving the efficiency of the health care delivery&#13;
system. The Project will: (i) facilitate the restructuring of the health sector by strengthening&#13;
the policy analysis and management capacity in the sector; and (ii) protect the population at&#13;
large--and vulnerable groups in particular--by ensuring continuing provision of essential&#13;
health services during the transition period and beyond. The Project consists of four&#13;
&#13;

components: (a) Policy Analysis and Management; (b) Primary Health Care; (c) Emergency&#13;
Medical Services; and (d) Blood Transfusion. The scope of each project component is&#13;
described in detail in Chapter 2 of the main text of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and&#13;
summarized briefly below. The Project will provide medical and laboratory equipment,&#13;
computer equipment and software, emergency medical and transport vehicles, technical&#13;
assistance, fellowships, training, rehabilitation of health facilities, and incremental recurrent&#13;
costs. Details of the elements/inputs financed by the Project for each component are outlined&#13;
in Appendix 2 (Detailed Cost Tables).&#13;
(a) Policy Analysis and Management. This component will assist the MOH in&#13;
strengthening its capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited&#13;
number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis and cost-effectiveness&#13;
studies. The component will also finance computer software and hardware, as well as&#13;
basic office equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of&#13;
Regional Health Centers, as they introduce new methodologies related to public&#13;
health sector restructuring and flexible budgeting, and monitor and evaluate the&#13;
implementation of health sector reforms. The component will also finance long-term&#13;
and short-term fellowships in the areas of health planning, management, economics&#13;
and finance, and health education and communications, as well as public information&#13;
activities.&#13;
(b) Primary Health Care. This component will improve the quality and scope of&#13;
primary health care in selected municipalities, which are committed to the&#13;
introduction of the reform of health services delivery and financing, and to&#13;
improvement of the efficiency of the health sector. The component will finance&#13;
minor rehabilitation equipment and furniture for up to 312 local health centers and&#13;
polyclinics. It will also finance consultant services to assist MOH and Municipal&#13;
Councils to plan PHC activities, design and implement the new package of PHC&#13;
services and training programs for medical doctors, nurses and other health and social&#13;
workers and well targeted municipal health promotion activities.&#13;
(c) Emergency Medical Services. This component will support ongoing efforts by&#13;
MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of service delivery. EMS functions will be separated from those of the&#13;
PHC network and a three-tiered national EMS network will be created. The&#13;
component will finance minor civil works for base stations at the periphery and minor&#13;
civil works and equipment for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital&#13;
and 45 community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29&#13;
properly equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96 ambulances for&#13;
the basic life support teams in the pre-hospital services. The component will also&#13;
finance consultant services to assist in completing the project concept, coordinating&#13;

implementation, and in managing the EMS and in training medical, paramedical and&#13;
administrative staff.&#13;
(d) Blood Transfusion. This component will assist current efforts to improve the&#13;
supply and quality of blood and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the&#13;
network of blood transfusion centers, introducing safer and more up to date&#13;
technology, and promoting the recruitment of new donors. The component will&#13;
finance minor civil works and equipment to renovate existing facilities of the National&#13;
Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and the five Regional&#13;
Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora,&#13;
and Varna. It will also finance technical assistance to design programs and training&#13;
for health personnel engaged in donor recruitment, public relations, blood collection&#13;
and processing, and quality control.&#13;

5.          Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs have been updated to reflect prices at&#13;
the time of negotiations (November 1995), and are estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   Base Costs. Base and unit cost estimates are net of taxes and duties, and are&#13;
derived from: (a) costs of consultant services, fellowships and training based&#13;
on rates currently charged by local, European and North American consultants&#13;
and training programs; (b) recent international bids for ambulances and&#13;
quotations obtained from suppliers of hospital/medical and office equipment;&#13;
(c) estimated requirements for reference and training materials; (d) current&#13;
market prices for furniture; (e) recent contracts for building and refurbishment&#13;
of health facilities and from consultants' surveys of the current construction&#13;
costs; (f) aggregated costs of local and foreign specialized services, internal&#13;
travel and subsistence, and mission estimates of material and logistic needs to&#13;
estimate the preparation of studies; (g) staff-unit costs from current public&#13;
service salary scales adjusted to a level deemed competitive with the market&#13;
for local specialized services; and (h) non-salary recurrent costs based on&#13;
current Government rates. All project costs are estimated in US Dollars at&#13;
November 1995 prices. Conversions of unit prices from the local currency are&#13;
based on the prevailing official exchange rate at the time of negotiations in&#13;
November 1995 of 68.7 BGL per US Dollar.&#13;
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for unforeseen&#13;
physical variations (US$3.4 million) equivalent to ten percent of the base cost&#13;
of all items except for vehicle costs for which five percent was applied and&#13;
none for incremental recurrent costs. Price contingencies on base costs and&#13;
physical contingencies are estimated at about US$2.5 million equivalent, or six&#13;
percent, and reflect Bank estimates of local and international price increases."&#13;
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated&#13;
at about US$30.5 million including contingencies, or about 71 percent of total&#13;
project cost net of taxes and duties. Calculations of the foreign exchange&#13;
content is based on the following: (i) civil works and furniture for&#13;
rehabilitation of PHCs and EMS stations --15 percent; (ii) 40 percent for&#13;
rehabilitation of Transfusion Hematology Centers; (iii) 100 percent for foreign&#13;

(iv) 35 percent for local training; (iv) 25 percent for maintenance of vehicles&#13;
and equipment, and other non-salary operational costs; and (v) zero for local&#13;
specialist services, salaries of local staff, and building maintenance.&#13;
(d)   Customs Duties and Taxes. With the exception of technical assistance and&#13;
training contracts, works and goods required under the Project will not be&#13;
exempt from payment of customs duties and local taxes. MOH will ensure&#13;
that local resources for the payment of import duties and taxes on goods and&#13;
works to be purchased under the Project are available when needed. Project&#13;
costs include an estimated US$4.2 million equivalent in direct and indirect&#13;
taxes and duties to be financed by the Government.&#13;
(e)   Incremental Recurrent Costs. The project costs include BGL 280.1 million or&#13;
about US$4.0 million (base cost) to cover incremental operating costs directly&#13;
attributable to the Project during the five-year implementation period. These&#13;
consist mainly of incremental operation and maintenance expenditure for&#13;
emergency vehicles and hematology equipment. There are no significant&#13;
incremental costs for staff salaries expected other than support staff for project&#13;
management. Averaged over five years, the yearly requirement represents less&#13;
than one percent of the 1994 total Government budget for the health sector of&#13;
BGL 22.5 billion, and is deemed sustainable. Measures now being instituted&#13;
in the health sector to reduce recurrent costs, improve efficiency and increase&#13;
collection of user charges will place the incremental recurrent cost within&#13;
sustainable limits. During implementation, MOH will pay particular attention&#13;
to monitoring the adequacy of recurrent funds for maintenance and operation&#13;
of facilities and newly instituted programs, and take the necessary actions to&#13;
rectify any deficiencies.&#13;
6.          Fnancing Plan. The Project will be financed by a Bank Loan of US$26.0&#13;
million, a Grant from EU PHARE of US$2.3 million equivalent, a Loan from the Council of&#13;
Europe Social Development Fund (CEF) of US$11.0 million equivalent, and counterpart&#13;
funds from the Bulgarian Government equivalent to US$7.8 million. The Bank Loan of&#13;
US$26.0 million will finance 85 percent of the direct and indirect foreign exchange. Total&#13;
Bank financing will represent about 61 percent of total project cost net of taxes. The&#13;
Government selected a currency pool loan for this Project (rationale being requested from&#13;
Government). The Government has already obtained the EU PHARE Grant, and intends to&#13;
sign a separate loan agreement with CEF for the CEF Loan. All duties and taxes under the&#13;
Project will be financed by the Government. A Japan Grant of US$500,000 equivalent was&#13;
made available to contract critical specialist services and procure equipment necessary for&#13;
project preparation. Details of the financing plan are shown in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6&#13;
below.&#13;

7.          Disbursements. The proposed Bank Loan is expected to be disbursed over a&#13;
five and a half year period. The Closing Date will be on December 31, 2001.&#13;
8.          Disbursements against eligible expenditure will be made at the following rates:&#13;
(a)   Office and medical equipment and materials, and vehicles -- 100 percent of&#13;
foreign expenditures; 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost); and&#13;
80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and;&#13;
(b)   100 percent of expenditures for consultant services, fellowships and study&#13;
visits.&#13;
9.          Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and the timely flow of&#13;
funds to the implementing institutions, the Government will establish, maintain and operate,&#13;
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account for the Project. The&#13;
Special Account will be denominated in US Dollars and established in a bank acceptable to&#13;
Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account will be US$500,000, which amount&#13;
is judged adequate to cover an average four months of eligible expenditure under the Project.&#13;
Payments of eligible expenditure (goods, specialist services, fellowships and study tours) may&#13;
be made by the PMU out of the Special Account. Upon receipt of the Government request,&#13;
Bank will deposit into the Special Account an initial amount of US$250,000. When the&#13;
aggregate amount of disbursements reaches US$2.0 million, the amount deposited in the&#13;
Special Account will be increased to the full authorized allocation of US$500,000. The&#13;
Special Account will be replenished on a monthly basis or when the undisbursed balance falls&#13;
below an amount equal to 50 percent or less of the initial deposit. In addition to&#13;
documentation requirement stated in para. 10, monthly bank statements of the Special&#13;
Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany all replenishment&#13;
requests.&#13;
10.        All withdrawal applications will be fully documented except that contracts for&#13;
goods under US$200,000 equivalent and contracts for technical assistance, studies,&#13;
fellowships and training under US$50,000 will be supported by Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE) certified by the PMU Project Director. The required supporting documentation will&#13;
be retained by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for&#13;
the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made&#13;
available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request. The processing,&#13;
disbursement and monitoring of the allocations of the proceeds of the Bank Loan and&#13;
Government counterpart financing will be managed by the PMU in coordination and&#13;
consultation with the Ministry of Fir.ance (MOF). The financing plan by disbursement&#13;
category is shown below in Table 7. Estimates of semestral disbursements of the Bank Loan&#13;
are shown in Table 8.&#13;

11.                Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982). The Government will provide the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year, an audit report of such scope and detail as the&#13;
Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified Statements of Expenditure (SOE).&#13;
The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,&#13;

together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied&#13;
upon to support the related withdrawal applications. TORs for such audits have been&#13;
prepared and will be included in the POM.&#13;
C. Implementation and Coordination Arrangements&#13;
12.         Overview. The Borrower is the Republic of Bulgaria which is represented by&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Ministry of Health (MOH) will have overall&#13;
responsibility for the Project. The design of the Project has been carefully tailored to the&#13;
implementation and absorptive capacity of the MOH. The project management and&#13;
implementing agencies will be supported with appropriate technical assistance to strengthen&#13;
their implementation capacity. The Project will be implemented by MOH line departments,&#13;
and municipalities. The day-to-day coordination of all Project-related activities will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the MOH. A Project Coordination&#13;
Committee (PCC) has been established2' within MOH to oversee project implementation,&#13;
provide guidance and advice to the PMU, and ensure that project objectives remain consistent&#13;
with national health policy and priorities. Chaired by the Minister of Health, the PCC&#13;
includes: (i) heads of the PMU and MOH Departments involved in the Project; (ii) heads of&#13;
sector institutions directly involved in project implementation such as the National Center of&#13;
Health Informatics (NCHI), the National Center of Clinical and Transfusion Hematology&#13;
(NCCTH); and (iii) representatives of MOF.&#13;
13.         Project Coordination and Management. The PMU will have overall&#13;
responsibility for coordinating project implementation, managing project funds, monitoring&#13;
implementation progress, and liaison between MOH institutional units and with external&#13;
agencies including the Bank. To be effective, the PMU will be maintained as a compact,&#13;
well equipped unit, and provided with direct access to decision making authority in the MOH&#13;
and other agencies involved in the Project. The PMU has been established and is headed by&#13;
a full-time Project Manager -- a senior MOH official of sufficient authority and experience --&#13;
under the authority of the General Director for Health Policy and International Cooperation.&#13;
The PMU full-time staff include: (a) Deputy Project Manager responsible for coordinating&#13;
the Project's technical assistance program; (b) a Project Accountant; (c) a Project&#13;
Procurement Officer; (d) a bilingual Secretary responsible for project files/records, and&#13;
adequate support staff (e.g. accounting assistant, clerical personnel, etc.) as needed. To&#13;
facilitate daily operations and ensure proper collaboration with MOH staff and implementing&#13;
units, the PMU will be located in the MOH and be provided with suitable accommodations,&#13;
office technology, communications and transport facilities.&#13;
v' The PCC was established on July 11, 1994, by a circular decree issued by the Minister of Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                      Annex I&#13;
Page 13 of 46&#13;
14.        The PMU will have three principal sets of responsibilities: (a) coordination&#13;
and monitoring of all Project-related implementation activities; (b) procurement of technical&#13;
assistance (TA) and equipment, as well as monitoring compliance of other procurement with&#13;
procedures agreed with the Bank; and (c) management of project funds. The PMU will call&#13;
the attention of MOH management, and/or the Bank and other financiers as appropriate, any&#13;
implementation problems or issues which may arise that require immediate action.&#13;
Specifically, the PMU will be responsible for the following:&#13;
(a)   Project Coordination and Monitoring. PMU will be the principal liaison with&#13;
institutions outside the MOH, including the Bank, EU PHARE and CEF, for&#13;
project administration and supervision purposes. It will ensure that all&#13;
resources utilized under the Project (financial, physical, staff, etc.) are in&#13;
accordance with the Project's priorities and objectives. To this end, PMU will&#13;
(i) maintain up-to-date, detailed implementation schedules of each project&#13;
component; (ii) monitor compliance by the implementing institutions with&#13;
Project/Loan covenants and with agreed performance indicators; and&#13;
(iii) monitor the placement and performance of staff undertaking external&#13;
training, and of consultants contracted under the Project. PMU will prepare&#13;
and distribute, by the specified dates to relevant agencies: consolidated semi-&#13;
annual implementation progress reports; and annual financial audit reports.&#13;
(b)   Procurement. The PMU will be responsible for all procurement under the&#13;
project. PMU will undertake the procurement of all equipment, technical&#13;
assistance and services contracts, and overseas training contracts, in&#13;
collaboration with the relevant implementing departments/units as described&#13;
further below. The PMU will be responsible for reviewing procurement&#13;
action and compliance by implementing institutions with procedures and&#13;
documentation agreed with the Bank. The PMU will ensure that the Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents (SBD) prepared by the Bank for Bank-financed operations&#13;
in Bulgaria, are appropriately modified to suit the project requirements, and&#13;
used consistently for procurement under the Project. The PMU will be&#13;
involved in the conduct of the bids and bid evaluation, clear all procurement&#13;
documentation and follow up contract approval processes (obtaining the Bank's&#13;
prior approval where required) to ensure that all goods, works and services are&#13;
contracted in accordance with the procedures and documentation agreed with&#13;
the Bank. Specifically, the conduct and supervision of procurement activities&#13;
will be undertaken as follows:&#13;
(i)   Procurement of Works. Under the general supervision of PMU, the&#13;
MOH Department of Construction (MOH-DCON) will monitor and&#13;
supervise the rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities (PHC&#13;
centers, EMS stations, and RTHCs) under the Project. MOH-DCON&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-                         Annex 1&#13;
Page 14 of 46&#13;
will, inter alia, (1) ensure that the agreed building planning/design&#13;
norms are complied with in upgrading project facilities; (2) supervise&#13;
the work of consultant architects/engineers in the preparation of&#13;
construction plans and documents; (3) conduct the bidding process; and&#13;
(4) and oversee the progress of civil works and the performance of&#13;
building contractors.&#13;
(ii)   Procurement of Goods. The PMU will be responsible for the conduct&#13;
of all equipment and goods procurement under the Project. As needed,&#13;
in carrying out its procurement tasks, the PMU will involve the staff of&#13;
the MOH Economic and Finance Department (MOH-DEQ) as well as&#13;
the MOH departments responsible for implementing the respective&#13;
project components. PMU will, inter alia, (1) adapt the SBDs for the&#13;
procurement of goods prepared by the Bank for appropriate Project use;&#13;
(2) conduct the equipment bidding process including preparation of&#13;
specific bidding documents, issuance, reception and evaluation of bids&#13;
received; and (3) monitor the performance of equipment delivery and&#13;
installation contracts and of equipment suppliers.&#13;
(iii) Procurement of Technical Assistance (TA). PMU will have overall&#13;
responsibility for the procurement of consultant services and&#13;
fellowships contracts. In collaboration with the relevant MOH&#13;
technical unit, PMU will issue invitations to consulting firms, prepare&#13;
shortlists, preside over the evaluation of TA proposals, award&#13;
contracts, and monitor the contractual performance of specialists.&#13;
(c)   Management of Project Funds. The PMU will take measures to facilitate the&#13;
flow of resources to MOH agencies to enable successful implementation of&#13;
their Project-related tasks. PMU will administer the Special Account&#13;
established for the Project, process disbursement applications, and monitor the&#13;
use of Loan funds. It will maintain up-to-date accounts and records (contracts,&#13;
purchase orders, guarantees, etc.) of all Project-related expenditure&#13;
(investment and recurrent, Loan and Grant resources from the Bank, EU&#13;
PHARE and CEF, and Government counterpart funds), and keep updated&#13;
estimates of the total costs expected to be needed to complete the Project. The&#13;
PMU will monitor and take appropriate steps to obtain adequate Government&#13;
counterpart funds to finance the planned project activities. In this connection,&#13;
it will consolidate the estimates, prepared by each implementing Department or&#13;
unit, of the financial and other resource needs of their respective components&#13;
for each implementation year. These consolidated budgetary estimates will be&#13;
reviewed with the Bank during the annual project performance reviews for&#13;
adequacy, but in any event, sufficiently in advance of the Government's annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

budgetary presentation/approval processes to accommodate appropriate&#13;
changes.&#13;
15.         Project Implementation. Primary responsibility for the execution of the&#13;
project components rests with the respective MOH Departments and sectoral institutions&#13;
involved. These units will coordinate closely with PMU in carrying out their functions under&#13;
the Project. The main responsibilities of the implementing units are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Policy Analysis and Management Component. Overal responsibility for&#13;
implementation of this component will rest with the Deputy Minister for&#13;
Health Care Financing in the MOH. The existing Economic Analysis Unit&#13;
(EAU) in MOH will be strengthened with additional staff, training and&#13;
technical assistance and will assist MOH in analyzing policy options and&#13;
organizing and disseminating information on health sector reform. The EAU&#13;
will also coordinate certain activities carried out by various health institutes.&#13;
In particular, implementation of the regional health care restructuring exercise&#13;
and flexible budgeting activities will be the responsibility of technical teams&#13;
from different institutions, including the National Center for Health&#13;
Information (NCHI), National Insurance Research and Development Center&#13;
and the National Institute of Public Health.&#13;
(b)   Primary Health Care Component.  This component will be implemented by&#13;
the municipalities under the guidance and supervision of the MOH Department&#13;
for Health Services (DHS), in particular by the Division of Primary Health&#13;
Care (DPHC). In early 1995, with financial assistance from the Japan Grant&#13;
and foreign and national technical assistance, the DHS will organize a&#13;
workshop to prepare the Guidelines for implementing primary health care in&#13;
participating municipalities. Technical assistance wiU be provided by the&#13;
DPHC to participating municipalities, for the design of three-year Municipal&#13;
Plans of Action. Workshops will prepare the curriculum for the training&#13;
program in PHC, including health promotion for physicians and nurses. The&#13;
DPHC will ensure the supply of equipment and consumables to Primary&#13;
Health Care centers and small polyclinics. The overall management and&#13;
coordination of the program will be ensured through regular meetings in the&#13;
Districts and reviewed during the mid-term evaluation.&#13;
(c)   Emergency Medical Services Component. This component wiU be&#13;
implemented and coordinated at the national level by the Emergency Medical&#13;
Services (EMS) unit within the DHS. EMS has the main responsibility for&#13;
preparing the necessary regulations and instructions for the introduction of the&#13;
new system, as well as for making the arrangements and negotiating with&#13;
municipalities on the transfer of facilities and staff. The unit is staffed with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52 -                        Annex 1&#13;
Page 16 of 46&#13;
two EMS experts and is assisted by the working group, which has been&#13;
involved in the preparation of the component, and which includes&#13;
representatives of the district EMS network thus providing the necessary local&#13;
participation in the reform process. The EMS unit will use local expert&#13;
assistance for the finalization of the EMS reform program and the launching of&#13;
implementation at the regional level. The unit will also be responsible for the&#13;
organization and carrying out of the training programs planned under the&#13;
component. The PMU will collaborate with the Project Management Unit of&#13;
the EU PHARE-financed Project as necessary for the oversight of this&#13;
component.&#13;
(d)   Blood Transfusion Component. This component will be implemented by the&#13;
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) under the&#13;
MOH. The NCCTH is the main institution responsible for designing and&#13;
implementing national policies in the field of clinical and transfusion&#13;
hematology. It is also responsible for coordinating all services provided by the&#13;
network of blood transfusion centers and providing technical assistance as&#13;
required. The NCCTH performs research in clinical and transfusion&#13;
hematology, develops standardization and quality control documents, and is&#13;
engaged in the quality control of blood banks.The NCCTH will supervise the&#13;
implementation of the activities in the five Regional Transfusion Hematology&#13;
Centers (RTHC) included in the Project. These institutions are the main&#13;
regional centers for blood collection and blood processing. They perform&#13;
immunohematologic tests and tests for transmissive agents (HIV, hepatitis B&#13;
and C and syphilis). They monitor the validity and reliability of testing done&#13;
in other centers. The NCCTH and the five RTHCs will also be involved in&#13;
the blood donor recruitment program. They will work very closely with the&#13;
National Center for Health Promotion (NCHP).&#13;
16.         Each MOH Technical Department will ensure that their respective project&#13;
activities are carried out in accordance with agreed project objectives and performance&#13;
targets. Each implementing agency will establish a mechanism with the PMU to ensure the&#13;
timely flow of resources for implementing its programs. Typically, each implementing unit&#13;
or department will be responsible for the following activities:&#13;
(a)   in collaboration with the PMU: (i) finalizing the terms of reference (TOR) for&#13;
the specialist services, feasibility studies, and training (in-country and abroad)&#13;
required in their respective parts of the Project; and (ii) evaluating proposals&#13;
received for consulting services;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                       Annex 1&#13;
Page 17 of 46&#13;
(b)   monitoring the implementation of local training and seminars; and identifying&#13;
and tapping local expertise to assist in activities such as preparation of detailed&#13;
procedures and updated detailed implementation schedules;&#13;
(c)   in collaboration with PMU and DEQ: (i) finalizing the lists and detailed&#13;
specifications of equipment required in their respective components; and&#13;
(ii) valuating the equipment bids received for compliance with the technical&#13;
specifications and meeting the requirements of the end-user;&#13;
(d)   in collaboration with PMU and DCON, ascertaining that the upgrading of&#13;
facilities related to their respective components meet the technical requirements&#13;
of the end-user;&#13;
(e)   preparing periodic reports on the implementation progress of their respective&#13;
components, and submitting these to the PMU for inclusion in the semi-annual&#13;
report on project performance; and&#13;
(f)   preparing physical and financial forecasts of future actions required to&#13;
implement their parts of the Project, and forwarding these estimates to the&#13;
PMU for inclusion in the budgetary proposals for the succeeding&#13;
implementation year.&#13;
17.         Inter-Agency Coordination. Successful project implementation will depend&#13;
on close coordination among donor agencies -- EU PHARE, CEF, and the Bank, and the&#13;
effectiveness of PMU in bringing about this collaboration at project level. MOH and the&#13;
donors have agreed that: (a) technical data/information and progress reports on the Project&#13;
will be shared widely and openly; and (b) issues or potential problem areas will be brought&#13;
to the early attention of relevant authorities and the donors for appropriate response/action.&#13;
On-going programs initiated by WHO, as well as EU PHARE will be closely monitored to&#13;
identify areas where project activities could benefit from lessons learned.&#13;
D. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
18.         Procurement activities under the Project will be implemented as described&#13;
above in paras 15-17 under the overall supervision of PMU. Procurement will be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with procedures described in the Bank "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995) which govern the procurement of goods&#13;
contracts, with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1991) which govern the procurement of technical&#13;
assistance contracts, and with the documentation and procedures agreed with the Bank as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                       Annex 1&#13;
Page 18 of 46&#13;
appropriate and as explained further in the succeeding paragraphs. To the extent feasible,&#13;
bids for goods and services should be grouped into homogenous packages for greater&#13;
efficiency and more effective management of contracts, and in the case of goods for economy&#13;
of scale. SBDs for goods and services which have been developed by the Bank will be&#13;
adapted by PMU for use under the Project. The procurement arrangements under the&#13;
Project are summarized in Table 9 below. The following procurement methodologies are&#13;
expected to be used under the Project. The Project Procurement Plan is shown in Appgendix&#13;
4 to this PIP.&#13;
19.         Procurement of Goods. Contracts for the procurement of goods (equipment,&#13;
vehicles, materials and supplies will be conducted as follows:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (aCB). Vehicle and goods contracts which&#13;
are estimated to cost more than US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be&#13;
procured following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in&#13;
accordance with the January 1992 Bank Guidelines for Procurement Under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (Procurement Guidelines). Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents (SBD) for goods which have recently been developed by the Bank&#13;
for Bulgaria will be adapted by the PMU for use under the Project. Medical,&#13;
laboratory and office equipment (about US$11.1 million tendered in 8 major&#13;
packages) will be packaged according to related specialized fields. Vehicles (3&#13;
packages) totalling US$5.2 million equivalent will be also be procured&#13;
following ICB procedures. Equipment and vehicles procured through ICB will&#13;
account for about 62 percent of the total value of equipment and goods&#13;
requirements. The remaining 38 percent of the value of goods and equipment&#13;
will be grouped in packages suitable for procurement using other than ICB&#13;
procedures. In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through&#13;
ICB, domestic manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15&#13;
percent, or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the cost,&#13;
insurance and freight (CIF) prices of competing imports, in accordance with&#13;
Paras. 1 through 5 of Appendix 2 of the Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
(b)   The exceptions to ICB procurement will be as follows:&#13;
(i)   International Shopping (IS?. Procedures for IS will be used for small&#13;
amounts of equipment where the cost of ICB will clearly outweigh&#13;
possible price advantages. Contracts for equipment estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$200,000 per contract, not to exceed an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$2.5 million equivalent, will be awarded under IS procedures,&#13;
based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
suppliers from two eligible source countries in accordance with Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

(ii)   National Shopping (NS. Minor sundry items, medical supplies and&#13;
materials not exceeding US$10,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$50,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of&#13;
prudent national shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from&#13;
at least three independent local suppliers, in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(iii)   Direct Procurement. Goods and technical licenses which the Bank&#13;
agrees: (i) are of proprietary nature; (ii) the timely supply thereof is&#13;
critical for efficient project execution; or (iii) need to be compatible&#13;
with other installed equipment, may be procured through direct&#13;
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Such items include contracts for&#13;
intellectual property such as books, technical journals,training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software,&#13;
including annual upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights,&#13;
translation and reprinting rights for training materials, estimated to cost&#13;
about US$300,000 in the aggregate.&#13;
(iv)  Procurement from UNICEF. Based on existing relations between&#13;
UNICEF and MOH, there will be direct procurement from UNICEF of&#13;
medical equipment and materials for Primary Health Care centers&#13;
(aggregate US$6.0 million). The type of medical equipment and&#13;
materials required for PHC centers and polyclinics are normally found&#13;
in UNICEF warehouses. In case some of these medical equipment and&#13;
supplies for the PHCs are unavailable in UNICEF warehouses,&#13;
UNICEF may procure these goods for MOH in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures.&#13;
20.         Procurement of Technical Assistance. The technical assistance requirements&#13;
of the Project include consulting services, fellowships and study visits by selected Bulgarian&#13;
trainees in training institutions abroad, and in-country training for sector staff. The summary&#13;
of the Project's technical assistance and training needs is shown Appendix 5 - Technical&#13;
Assistance Schedule. Technical assistance contracts will be procured in the following&#13;
manner:&#13;
(a)   Consulting Services. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for&#13;
comprehensive packages of consultant services, management of fellowships&#13;
and training, preparation of pre-investment and development studies, and&#13;
architectural/engineering services, in accordance with the August 1991&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency (Consultant Guidelines). To keep the&#13;
evaluation process manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals&#13;
will be invited following a short listing acceptable to the Bank. The total&#13;
aggregate value of consultants contracts is estimated at US$1.0 million&#13;
equivalent, of which, about 60 percent will be awarded to consulting firms (4&#13;
packages) and the rest, which are short-term specialized services (19 contracts&#13;
between US$25,000-US$40,000), to individual consultants selected on a&#13;
competitive basis. All consulting services will be procured in keeping with the&#13;
terms of reference described in the POM. Implementing units will be&#13;
provided with adequate technical support by the PMU to manage the selection&#13;
process.&#13;
(b)   Fellowships and Training. To the extent feasible, the management of&#13;
fellowships and training programs will be included in the procurement of&#13;
consulting contracts, and will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                       Anne1&#13;
Page 21 of 46&#13;
Consultant Guidelines. The aggregate values of fellowships and training&#13;
programs is estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent. In most cases, overseas&#13;
training will be arranged directly with a selected training institution following&#13;
agreement with the Bank on the program and duration of training, the choice&#13;
of training institution, the candidates for fellowships, cost of the program and&#13;
arrangements for the re-entry of the fellowship candidate after completing&#13;
training.&#13;
21.         Non-Bank Financed Procurement. CEF and EU PHARE will finance some&#13;
elements/components of the Project. Procurement under these parts of the Project will be in&#13;
accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and these donor agencies. In&#13;
particular: (a) all contracts for (i) civil works (aggregate US$11.9 million equivalent) for the&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities; and (ii) furniture (aggregate US$1.1 million)&#13;
for project institutions, which are financed by CEF, will be awarded in accordance with&#13;
procurement procedures agreed between the Council of Europe and the Government;&#13;
(b) procurement of goods, consultant services, and training contracts under the Policy&#13;
Analysis subcomponent of Component 1, which are financed by EU PHARE, will be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with procedures agreed between EU PHARE and the Government;&#13;
and (c) items of incremental recurrent salary and non-salary expenditure (aggregate US$2.6&#13;
million) will be financed entirely by the Government and contracted in accordance with&#13;
regular Government procedures.&#13;
22.         Review of Procurement Decisions. In compliance with Bank procedures,&#13;
SBDs will be used for all ICB procurement. The Bank will review master lists and technical&#13;
specifications of equipment, packaging of bids and updated cost estimates, bidding documents&#13;
(including invitations for bids, instructions to bidders, bid evaluation criteria, bid proposal&#13;
documents, general and special conditions of contract, and draft contract agreement). For&#13;
technical assistance contracts, the Bank will review TORs, invitations for proposals,&#13;
evaluation criteria, and draft contracts. It is estimated that this prior review will cover&#13;
about 75 percent of the value of all contracts combined for equipment and technical&#13;
assistance. The remaining 25 percent of contracts will be subject to selective post award&#13;
reviews by the Bank during the supervision of the Project. In accordance with procedures&#13;
described in Appendix 1 of the Bank Procurement Guidelines, the Bank will conduct a prior&#13;
review of the following contracts:&#13;
(a)   all contracts awarded through ICB;&#13;
(b)   all goods contracts procured through UNICEF;&#13;
(c)   for each project component: (i) the first two goods contracts awarded through&#13;
international shopping; and (ii) all contracts awarded through direct&#13;
procurement.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                       Annex I&#13;
Page 22 of 46&#13;
(d)   technical assistance: (i) contracts above US$50,000 equivalent--all&#13;
procurement documentation (budgets, TORs, selection procedures, short lists,&#13;
letters of invitation, evaluation report, draft contracts); (ii) single-source&#13;
consultant contracts and assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by Bank-- all procurement documentation (see above);&#13;
(iii) contracts below US$50,000 equivalent--TORs; and (iv) amendments to the&#13;
employment of consultants raising the contract value to more than US$50,000-&#13;
-TORs; and,&#13;
(d) fellowships and training: TORs for external fellowships and study visits.&#13;
E. Implementation. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
23.         Project Implementation Calendar. The Project is expected to be completed&#13;
within a five-year implementation period beginning early 1996. The Project Completion&#13;
Date is June 30, 2001. Project preparation activities have been in progress since 1993, such&#13;
that at the time of negotiations in November 1995, project preparation activities are well&#13;
advanced -- the TORs for major technical assistance assignments have been drafted, vehicle&#13;
and equipment lists for project institutions as well draft technical specifications and bidding&#13;
documents have been completed, building and design norms for the health facilities as well as&#13;
preliminary architectural designs for Transfusion Hematology Centers have been completed&#13;
and reviewed by the Bank. In order to ensure that the Project starts procurement activities&#13;
by June 1996, the MOH/PMU will ensure that the Project Operational Manual has been&#13;
finalized, incorporating the Bank's suggestions. Furthermore, MOH will ensure that the&#13;
following actions have been taken:&#13;
(a)   finalize bidding documents for the procurement of goods and services, and bid&#13;
packages for goods to be procured during the first year of project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(b)   finalize architectural/engineering plans and bidding documents for refurbishing&#13;
the RTHCs;&#13;
(c)   finalize TORs for the specialist services and training to be conducted during&#13;
the first year of the Project; and&#13;
(d)   complete the engineering survey of EMS and PHC facilities to be rehabilitated&#13;
during the first year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                        Annex 1&#13;
Page 23 of 46&#13;
24.         Appendix 2 (detailed costs of each project component) also indicates the&#13;
schedule of project inputs by year of project implementation, and will be translated into a&#13;
detailed implementation schedule in the form of a bar charts outlining the sequence of critical&#13;
steps taken to complete each activity. The implementation bar chart will form an integral&#13;
part of the POM for each component. Models of the implementation bar chart for each type&#13;
of project activity (for the procurement of works, goods and consulting services contracts)&#13;
are shown in Appendix 6 of this PIP.&#13;
25.         Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PMU will prepare semi-annual&#13;
descriptive and financial reports on each project component, objective and activity, beginning&#13;
from the date of Loan Effectiveness. The reports will describe: (a) current status;&#13;
(b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and&#13;
corrective actions being taken. Sample progress-reporting documents will be included in the&#13;
POM. Reporting and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of the policy&#13;
framework for sectoral improvements, the consistency of activities for each component and&#13;
subcomponent with agreements reached at negotiations, performance of the implementing&#13;
groups and institutions, assessment of emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters,&#13;
and possible follow-up operations which could be supported by the Bank. Bank supervision&#13;
will be based on the semi-annual progress reports and the annual evaluation of project&#13;
activities by the MOH. This will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and&#13;
availability of financial resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical&#13;
assistance groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various&#13;
components, and discussions with responsible authorities. The PIP will be the basis for&#13;
supervision and reporting.&#13;
26.         Mid-Term Review and Evaluation. By December 31, 1998 (or about two&#13;
and one-half years after Loan Effectiveness), the PMU will undertake jointly with the Bank a&#13;
mid-term review of progress in project implementation to determine whether: (a) the&#13;
Project's intended objectives remain valid; (b) implementation is advancing satisfactorily to&#13;
justify its continued implementation; and (c) any adjustments to, or significant restructuring&#13;
of the Project are necessary to improve its effectiveness. The POM will be updated&#13;
following the mid-term review and the annual work program for the following years will&#13;
reflect the recommendations made. The PMU will prepare draft TORs for the mid-term&#13;
review and present these for the Bank's comments by the end of September 1998.&#13;
27.         Role of the World Bank During Supervision. Because this is the first&#13;
Project in the health sector in Bulgaria, the Project will, on average, require about 25 staff-&#13;
weeks of intensive Bank supervision per year during the first two years of implementation to&#13;
launch the many of the new Project-related activities. These include the training of primary&#13;
health care workers, introduction of management reforms and computerized management&#13;
support systems in hospitals. Whenever possible, Bank staff will supervise the human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

28.           Monitoring Development Objectives. Tracking key monitoring indicators is&#13;
necessary to measure the impact of the project inputs on the key development objectives.&#13;
These indicators have been agreed upon and will be monitored throughout the project cycle.&#13;
At the mid-term review, the need to fine-tune or restructure the project design will be based&#13;
on the analysis of these indicators. In order to assess the impact of a given intervention on&#13;
development objectives, four sets of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate progress&#13;
during project implementation: input indicators, output indicators, outcome indicators, and&#13;
financial indicators. Input/Outpbt Tables will be prepared for each subcomponent of the&#13;
1i Supplementary technical inputs will be requested through bilateral/multilateral cooperation in the&#13;
following areas: public health economics, health planning, management development, public health&#13;
education, and health information systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                        Annex 1&#13;
Page 25 of 46&#13;
Project and included in the POM. These tables will be used to monitor the progress in&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
(a)   Input Indicators. These indicators will track planned investments in terms of&#13;
contracting technical assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-&#13;
months) in training programs and procurement of goods and civil works&#13;
(disbursements). These indicators are represented in standard input tables for&#13;
each major subcomponent of the Project as shown in Appendix 2.&#13;
(b)   Output Indicators. These indicators will track items such as: (i) the number&#13;
of studies or reports that have been completed by a given date during the&#13;
project cycle; (ii) the number of training programs held and students trained:&#13;
(iii) the equipment or vehicles that have been procured; and (iv) the number of&#13;
equipped facilities that have been constructed or renovated. These indicators&#13;
will be tracked in standard Output Tables for each major subcomponent of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
(c)   Outcome Indicators. These indicators will track whether or not the&#13;
development objectives of the Project have been met. Two criteria were used&#13;
to select the basic outcome indicators for health status: (i) that the indicator is&#13;
known to be sensitive to the intervention introduced under the Project; and&#13;
(ii) that data is readily available through routine collection.&#13;
(d)   Financial Indicators. The POM will include detailed financial requirements&#13;
based on the timing of major procurement packages. The PMU will be&#13;
responsible for monitoring and reviewing the financial plan for the Project to&#13;
ensure that there will be sufficient lead time to submit realistic annual budget&#13;
requirements to the MOF. The PMU will also monitor the effect of the&#13;
Project on incremental and recurrent costs of the health sector. The&#13;
introduction of modern management systems to hospital operations is expected&#13;
to improve the efficiency and reduce overall unit costs.&#13;
29.         For each of the four components, process and outcome indicators have been&#13;
agreed upon. These outcome and intermediate process indicators will be tracked during the&#13;
Project through routine data collection and simple survey sampling techniques. During the&#13;
mid-term review, these indicators will be analyzed and possible corrections of the project&#13;
implementation procedures will be effected. Throughout the Project, the PMU wil be&#13;
responsible for: (a) tracking the above indicators; (b) tracking inputs and outputs as they&#13;
relate to the project development activities; and (c) overseeing proposed studies and other&#13;
pre-investment studies. This committee will be headed by an applied operations research&#13;
specialist and will report directly to the PMU Director.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
OUTLINE OF PROJECT OPERATIONAL MANUAL&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          This Project Operational Manual (POM) has been prepared by the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) jointly with each implementing unit/department. The POM&#13;
constitutes implementation guidelines, and project performance and outcome monitoring tool&#13;
for each project component. The POM comprises four volumes, each of which elaborate the&#13;
implementation procedures applicable to each Project component, as well as information&#13;
from relevant documents developed at the various stages of project preparation and at&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
2.          Project Objectives and Scope. The Health Sector Restructuring Project aims&#13;
to prevent further deterioration in the health status of the population, while at the same time&#13;
improving the efficiency of the health care delivery system. The project would: (i) facilitate&#13;
the restructuring of the health sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management&#13;
capacity in the sector; (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable groups in particular-&#13;
-by ensuring continuing provision of essential health services during the transition period and&#13;
beyond; and (iii) monitor the health status of the population and strengthen health promotion&#13;
activities. The Project consists of four components: (a) Policy Analysis and Management;&#13;
(b) Primary Health Care; (c) Emergency Medical Services; and (d) Blood Transfusion. The&#13;
operational procedures for each project component are described in the following sections.&#13;

BULGARIA&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
THE HEALTH OF THE BULGARIAN POPULATION&#13;
I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.          Since the 1950s, the health of the Bulgarian population has substantially&#13;
improved as shown by trends in most of the broad health indicators (Table 1). This&#13;
improvement, however, has lagged since 1985 and appears to be reversing itself in the last 4-&#13;
5 years. Progressive aging of the population contributes to this situation and raises problems&#13;
of constantly increasing social and medical costs, a phenomenon common to all European&#13;
countries. Specific death rates by age show a significant increase among persons aged 40 to&#13;
59 over the last 30 years. This increase is essentially due to the excess mortality among&#13;
males in this age group. Hence, the health of the middle-aged adult is a challenge to the&#13;
Bulgarian health system.&#13;
2.          The Bulgarian Health System has major assets, in particular excellent access&#13;
to health care provided "free of charge" to the population through an extensive network of&#13;
health centers, polyclinics, hospitals and institutes. The system, however, is rather&#13;
inefficient, as discussed in Annex 3, because of its duplication, overstaffing, inadequate&#13;
management and poorly allocated recurrent budget. Consequently, the system places a heavy&#13;
fiscal burden on a country where government revenues have contracted by 50 percent in real&#13;
terms since 1989. Despite this contraction, the Government maintained health expenditure in&#13;
real terms until 1993. However, the inevitable adjustment of public health expenditure to the&#13;
fiscal crisis, combined with the fast pace of decentralization of the health care delivery&#13;
system and the unregulated emergence of private health care providers is leading to further&#13;
deterioration in the quality of health care.&#13;
3.          Over the past three years the Government has taken a number of painful but&#13;
necessary steps to improve the balance between available resources and expenditures: limits&#13;
on medical school enrolment, restructuring of the Medical Academy and of the medical&#13;
schools, closure of excess sanatoria beds (around 3,400), privatization of the drug&#13;
distribution system, and setting new norms for medical services. The Ministry of Health and&#13;
the medical community are now wrestling with the most complex and often controversial&#13;
issues such as the financing of health services, the allocation of resources in a decentalized&#13;
setting and the types of incentives to improve both greater efficiency and quality of health&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 19&#13;
4.          Stagnation or deterioration in health indicators appears to be due, inter alia, to&#13;
the lack of investment in the sector because of a declining economic situation, and to the&#13;
inefficient utilization of the recurrent budget. Consequently, this led to a deep deterioration&#13;
of the health system, in particular the primary health care (PHC) system, which could not&#13;
fulfill its "triage" role. The lack of effectiveness of PHC has put additional stress on an&#13;
already overwhelmed emergency and hospital system.&#13;
II. POPULATION&#13;
5.          According to the 1992 census, the population of Bulgaria was 8.484.900, with&#13;
sixty seven percent of the population living in urban areas. The distribution of the population&#13;
by Region and by urban/rural residence is presented in Table 2 and the structure by age and&#13;
sex is presented in Table 3. It is worth noting that the rural population is older, and the&#13;
proportion of working age group (ages 15 to 59) is less than in urban areas. The broad&#13;
trends in population dynamics indicate:&#13;
(a)   a progressive aging of the population over the past 35 years (from 13% over&#13;
60 years of age in 1965 to 20% in 1992);&#13;
(b)   a rapid urbanization of the population between 1946 and 1980 (urban&#13;
population of 25% in 1946 and 62.5% in 1980), with a slow down in recent&#13;
years (67% in 1992);&#13;
(c)   very little improvement of life expectancy at birth over the past 35 years&#13;
(from 69.59 in 1960 to 71.21 in 1993) except for women (71.35 in 1960 to&#13;
74.66 in 1991); and&#13;
(d)   as in other European countries, a low rate of population growth since the&#13;
1970s and even a negative growth rate since 1990. This last trend is related&#13;
to a decrease in natality (lower fertility rate and smaller number of women of&#13;
reproductive age), coupled to an increase in mortality linked to the aging&#13;
population.&#13;
6.          Table 4 shows that Bulgaria's natality is at the low end amongst the countries&#13;
of Eastem Europe and tends towards Western Europe's pattern. In recent years, the lack of&#13;
population growth has been exacerbated by an important emigration of young adults.&#13;
Although the Total Fertility Rate shows a decline from 2.31 in 1960 to 1.45 in 1993, there is&#13;
little use of modem methods of family planning.&#13;
7.    Reproductive health has the same characteristics as in most East European countries&#13;
i.e. reliance on abortion as the main method of fertility control. While the contraceptive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 19&#13;
prevalence rate was estimated to be 76% in the late 1970s, it was mainly traditional methods.&#13;
The number of abortions is reported to be around 130,000-150,000 per year over the last ten&#13;
years. The ratio of abortions to live births was 1,480 abortions per 1,000 births in 1992.&#13;
This corresponds approximately to an average of 2.3 abortions per woman during her&#13;
reproductive period. This situation appears due in part to (i) the high cost of contraception&#13;
in comparison to abortion; (ii) the lack of adequate contraceptive education at the time of&#13;
abortion; (iii) the lack of involvement of the medical and paramedical professions in&#13;
contraception, except for gynecologists; and (iv) cultural factors.&#13;
mI. HEALTH STATUS&#13;
8.         If the lack of improvement of the health situation of the adult population, in&#13;
particular for males (reduced life expectancy of males, increased cardio- and cerebrovascular&#13;
pathology), is a long standing problem, the deterioration of infant health appeared at the end&#13;
of the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth for males has not improved since 1960 (from 67.8&#13;
years in 1960 to 67.6 years in 1992) and actually has decreased since 1965, when it reached&#13;
68.8 years (Table 5). By comparison life expectancy at birth for males is 75 in Sweden, 73&#13;
in France and 74 in The Netherlands. There is also a clear excess mortality among males&#13;
between the ages of 15 and 49. The death rate (age 15 - 49) in 1991 was 2.17/1,000 males&#13;
and of 0.97/1,000 females. This remains a major health problem for the health sector in&#13;
Bulgaria.&#13;
9.          Tables 6 and 7 indicate that in 1991 Bulgaria's health indicators were lagging&#13;
behind many European countries. However, when compared to countries of similar per&#13;
capita income (Table 7) Bulgaria has better health than the average Lower-Middle-Income&#13;
Country.&#13;
A. Health Indicators&#13;
10.        Between 1960 and 1990 the trends in health indicators show that:&#13;
(a)   Life expectancy in Bulgaria is low compared to most European countries, in&#13;
particular for men (67.6 in 1992), and has not improved since 1965.&#13;
(b)   Infant mortality has decreased from 45.1 per 1,000 live births in 1960, to&#13;
13.6 in 1988, it should be noted, however, that there has been a recent&#13;
significant increase in infant mortality (from 13.6 per thousand in 1988 to 16.9&#13;
per thousand in 1991 with a decrease to 15.9 in 1992 and to 15.5 in 1993).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 19&#13;
This level is high for Europe (the 22nd highest out of 27 European countries)&#13;
with prematurity and perinatal mortality being especially high.&#13;
(c)   In spite of a substantial decrease over the past 30 years, maternal mortality&#13;
(20 per 100,000 live births in 1980-90) is among the highest in Europe (25th&#13;
highest out of 27 European countries).&#13;
(d)   A rise in the mortality rate of the population in the 40 - 59 age group&#13;
(from 3.4 per thousand in 1960 to 4.6 in 1993 for the 40-49 age group, and&#13;
from 8.1 per thousand in 1960 to 10.6 per thousand in 1993 for the 50-59 age&#13;
group).&#13;
(e)   Rural Bulgaria presents very different demographic and health indicators than&#13;
the urban part of the country (see Table 8). Such differences may be due to:&#13;
(i) the migration of the active population to the cities; (ii) lower economic and&#13;
social development of rural areas; and (iii) lower access to quality health&#13;
services. Expectedly, an older rural population experiences a higher crude&#13;
death rate but there is also a real excess mortality in rural areas as evidenced&#13;
by the age specific death rates by causes for infants and children (see Tables 9&#13;
and 10).&#13;
B. Causes of Death&#13;
11.         The main causes of death, in 1993, were Cardiovascular diseases (62.7%),&#13;
Cancer (14.3%), Senility and other Ill-defined Conditions (5.1%), Accidents, Poisoning and&#13;
Violence (5.1 %), and Respiratory System diseases (5.6%) (see Table 11). This is not&#13;
unexpected in a country with an aging population. Among infants the main causes of&#13;
mortality are: (i) conditions related to the perinatal period; (ii) congenital malformation;&#13;
(iii) diseases of the respiratory system; (iv) Accidents, Poisoning and Violence; and&#13;
(v) infectious diseases.&#13;
Adult Mortality&#13;
12.         The mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria is among the highest&#13;
in Europe and in particular among males. The standardized mortality rate at age 0-64 for&#13;
diseases of the circulatory system was 160 per 100,000 population in 1990, thus placing&#13;
Bulgaria in the 25th position in the group of 27 European countries. Among circulatory&#13;
system diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, in Bulgaria, have the highest mortality in Europe&#13;
and ischemic heart diseases have the 20th highest mortality among the 27 European&#13;
Countries. This problem is most serious because, in contrast with the general trends in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 19&#13;
Europe, it has worsened in Bulgaria on an average of 2% per year during the 1980s.&#13;
Arterial hypertension is frequent, even in young adults.&#13;
13.         The cancer Standardized Mortality Rate (SMR) for age 0-64 was&#13;
91/100,000 population in 1990, which is below the European average, but rising. Under age&#13;
65, the standardized cancer mortality is 30.7 per 100,000 for digestive organs, 21.4 for&#13;
trachea/bronchus/lung, 15.6 for breast and 4.2 for cervix (see table 7). Mortality for&#13;
digestive organs and the uterine cervix are higher than the European averages, and are rising.&#13;
14.         The standardized mortality rate (SMR 0-64) for diseases of the respiratory&#13;
system was reported to be 70 in 1992 (24th highest among 31 European countries).&#13;
Respiratory infections are the second most frequent cause of hospitalization after delivery and&#13;
pregnancy. This may result from air pollution in some industrial areas, tobacco consumption&#13;
(4.1 kg per inhabitant as compared to 1.5 kg in Sweden, 2.3 kg in France and 3.0 kg in the&#13;
Netherlands in 1990), difficult living conditions, and inadequate health care services.&#13;
15.         Accidents and intoxications are a relatively important cause of morbidity and&#13;
mortality, especially in children (first cause of mortality in the 1-14 year age group), and in&#13;
the young adult male. In contrast with the regression noted in most other European countries,&#13;
mortality due to these causes was stable in Bulgaria over the last 10 years.&#13;
16.         Infectious and parasitic diseases are well controlled, with the exception of&#13;
respiratory infections among children. One should stress, however, that a deterioration of&#13;
the health system and/or of the socio-economic situation could easily reverse this process. A&#13;
case in point is the increased incidence of tuberculosis since 1990 and the epidemic of&#13;
measles in 1992.&#13;
Maternal and Infant Mortality&#13;
17.         Although enormous progress has been achieved in the last 30 years, indicators&#13;
of maternal and child health are still poor when compared with Western European countries.&#13;
Health status of children&#13;
18.         Perinatal mortality has fallen from 18.8/1.000 live births in 1960 to 10.8 in&#13;
1989, to rise again to 13.2 in 1992. In 1990 this was 7 in Sweden; 9 in France, and 10 in the&#13;
Netherlands. Infant mortality reached its lowest level in 1988 (13.6/1,000 live births) but&#13;
increased to 15.5/1,000 in 1993 (against 6 in Sweden, 7 in France, and 8 in the Netherlands&#13;
in the same year). Under-5 mortality rate is 21/1,000 (against 8 in Sweden, 9 in France&#13;
and 9 in the Netherlands in 1990).&#13;
19.         The main causes of infant mortality are, in decreasing order: (i) problems&#13;
related to the perinatal period (for instance delivery) (29%); (ii) congenital malformations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 19&#13;
(26%) (360 congenital abnormalities/100,000 live births in Bulgaria, 168 in France, 222 in&#13;
Sweden, 274 in The Netherlands, 346 in Hungary, 444 in Poland); and (iii) pneumonia&#13;
(24%). In children aged 1 to 5 years, the main causes of death are respiratory diseases and&#13;
congenital abnormalities. The first cause of mortality from age 1 to 14 are accidents and&#13;
poisoning (36%).&#13;
Maternal Health&#13;
20.         Maternal mortality, with 20 maternal deaths for 100,000 live births in the&#13;
1980s, remains one of the highest in Europe. This could be due in part to inadequate labor&#13;
and delivery services and to the persistence of non-medical abortions in spite of their&#13;
legalization (apparently many women are unable to obtain the procedure during the 12 week&#13;
limit). The causes for this situation are certainly multiple but the quality of perinatal care,&#13;
the management of high risk pregnancy, the emergency referral system, abortion legislation&#13;
and management, and the availability of blood products appear to play an important role.&#13;
C. Morbidity&#13;
21.         The number of cases of illness registered in 1992 in medical establishments&#13;
was above 12 million of which 37% were children under 15 years or 2.7 contacts per child&#13;
per year. There was on average 1.1 registered illness per year and per adult in 1992. In the&#13;
same year, there was 1.4 million discharges from hospitals (17% were children under 15).&#13;
Among communicable diseases, the five most frequent ones, in 1992, were influenza,&#13;
chicken pox, measles, hepatitis and rubeola. In 1991, insured working personnel were&#13;
absent from work an average 7.48 days per person.&#13;
22.         The major reasons for consulting the general health services in 1993 were:&#13;
(i) diseases of respiratory system (41.8%); (ii) diseases of the nervous system and of the&#13;
sense organs (12,6%); (iii) diseases of the circulatory system (7.3%); (iv) diseases of the&#13;
skin and cellular tissue (7%); and (v) genito-urinary system (5.4%). Again in 1993, the&#13;
principal causes for hospitalization were: deliveries and complications of pregnancy&#13;
(18.8%), diseases of the respiratory system (16.5%), diseases of the circulatory system&#13;
(11.6%), and diseases of the genito-urinary system (9.4%).&#13;
23.         While the high degree of environmental pollution in Eastern European&#13;
countries is well known, (especially industrial pollution) it is not easy to demonstrate a clear&#13;
linkage with the morbidity. One should, however, mention the elevated lead contents of&#13;
blood in children and adults in Pernik, Plovdiv, Asenovgard, and Vratsa. A high incidence&#13;
of lung cancer has also been reported in highly polluted areas, such as in Southern Bulgaria&#13;
and in the area of Burgas (oil refinery). The role of environmental pollution in the high&#13;
infant mortality due to respiratory diseases and congenital malformations is less clear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
A. General Organization&#13;
24.         The Ministry of health had been traditionally responsible for developing health&#13;
policy, plans and budget, preparing health legislation, and evaluating the health status of the&#13;
country, as well as delivering most services. Parallel health systems also exist for special&#13;
groups of workers under the responsibility of the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Internal&#13;
Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation and the Enterprise Medical Services. Most services&#13;
are, however, publicly financed and publicly provided at no charge to the user. In 199?, the&#13;
responsibility for the delivery of primary and secondary care was decentralized from the&#13;
Ministry of Health to the Municipalities, which receive their budget directly from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (see Annex 3). The Ministry of Health manages several National&#13;
Institutes and tertiary hospitals, paramedical schools, as well as a network of sanitary and&#13;
epidemiological centers (ex SANEPID in the Soviet system). The epidemiology and&#13;
sanitation centers have the responsibility , at the District level, for the quality of water, food,&#13;
control of communicable diseases, pollution and other pestilence. The organigram of the&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) is given in Chart 13. The National Center for Health&#13;
Informatics, under the Ministry of Health, gathers health statistics for the whole country.&#13;
25.         The private practice of medicine is presently authorized in Bulgaria but the&#13;
lack of a Medical Insurance system and the past reliance on "free" medical services as well&#13;
as the poor economic situation of the population have prevented the creation of a true private&#13;
sector. The present situation is characterized by the "after hours" participation in the private&#13;
sector of many publicly paid physicians but a total lack of incentives for them to forsake&#13;
their public positions.&#13;
26.         In 1993 the MOH gave high priority to addressing five main issues:&#13;
(a)    adopting a new mode of financing health services;&#13;
(b)    modifying the mode of practice of health care in particular the relationship&#13;
between medical specialties and between public and private sectors;&#13;
(c)   improving access to quality family planning services;&#13;
(d)    preparing and implementing a new pharmaceutical policy; and&#13;
(e)    restructuring some critical medical sectors such as emergency care,&#13;
transfusion services and oncology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92 -                  Annex 2&#13;
Page 9 of 19&#13;
B. Level of Services and Physical Infrastructure&#13;
27.         The front line of health services is made of Rural Health Centers and various&#13;
types of Polyclinics, according to the rural or urban status of the areas and their population&#13;
size. To a certain extent the ambulatory services of hospitals could also be included in this&#13;
basic category. In 1993, 3,393 Rural Health Centers, 51 public Polyclinics, 10 enterprise&#13;
Polyclinics and 93 dental clinics were operating. These basic structures refer their&#13;
complicated patients to 95 Community Hospitals, 30 District Hospitals, 11 Enterprise&#13;
Hospitals and to a large number of tertiary hospital structures (University, Institutes,&#13;
pediatrics, mental, maternity, pulmonary, sanatoria, etc.). At the top of the pyramid the&#13;
National Medical Institutes and the Medical Academy Hospital represent the ultimate&#13;
reference centers. In 1993 there were 88,910 hospital beds and 19,278 sanatorium beds.&#13;
28.         The health network provides a good coverage of the population. The quality of&#13;
the health services is however hindered by the lack of investment (lack of equipment), poorly&#13;
targeted recurrent budget (lack of consumables, low salaries of health professionals) and by&#13;
the lack of incentives in the primary health care sector. But in terms of quantity of&#13;
outpatient structures or hospital beds, Bulgaria with 1,056 beds per 100,000 population is&#13;
among the most richly endowed European countries (Belgium 830, Denmark 823, France&#13;
931, Ireland 385, Netherlands 594, Average for Europe 940). Many structures, however,&#13;
are old and have been poorly maintained. Many renovation will be needed in the next 20&#13;
years.&#13;
29.         The number of Government health facilities is more than adequate but these&#13;
structures are generaUly old, their technology obsolete and they lack modern management and&#13;
quality control. At the periphery, there have been shortages of (i) essential drugs which may&#13;
now be getting out of reach of some vulnerable groups because of costs; and (ii) diagnostic&#13;
and clinical medical equipment. Difficult working conditions and low salaries lead to low&#13;
morale among the health providers. As a result of these shortcomings, the PHC level has&#13;
deteriorated and the population tends to bypass the primary care level to seek care in&#13;
hospitals where free drugs and minimum standards of care remain available. The use of&#13;
secondary or tertiary care institutions to provide primary health care and, even at times,&#13;
social services increases unnecessarily the cost of health care delivery.&#13;
C. Human Resources&#13;
30.         A total of 28,457 physicians worked in the public sector in 1993 or 1/297&#13;
population. Between 1,500 and 2,000 physicians worked in the private sector. Eighty&#13;
percent of the physicians in the public sector are considered as specialists (20,000), including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3,641 pediatricians (1/466 children under 15 years), 1,594 gynecologists (1/1.350 women in&#13;
reproductive age), and 2,902 surgeons. The remaining 20% of the physicians that are not&#13;
specialists are not considered as general practitioners (this "specialty" does not exist in&#13;
Bulgaria) but rather are in transition toward some kind of specialization. The MOH&#13;
estimates that in 1993 12,700 physicians providing general medical services in ambulatory&#13;
settings. Data from the NCHI estimates at 3,900 visits per year for the "Generalist" and&#13;
3,700 for the pediatrician. To these activities should be added 562 home visits per year for&#13;
the "Generalist" and 575 for the Pediatrician. There were around 5,700 dentists and 2,400&#13;
pharmacistsin 1993, of which a large number were working in the national pharmaceutical&#13;
industry.&#13;
31.         The paramedical personnel working in the public sector numbered around&#13;
83,396 persons, of which 52,038 nurses (1.8/1 physician), 7,000 medical assistants&#13;
(Feldcher), 7,000 midwives, and 13,000 medical technicians (laboratory, radiology,&#13;
pharmacy and dental). The total number of employees in the health services (including&#13;
administrative and maintenance personnel) was 180.000. Wages of health professionals are&#13;
around 15% lower than the average national wages, a fact that does not motivate this&#13;
personnel.&#13;
32.         With one physician per 297 population in 1993 and one nurse per 101&#13;
population, the number of health providers is largely adequate. There are however serious&#13;
problems of adequacy of training, lack of quality continuing education and maldistribution&#13;
between GPs and specialists.&#13;
D. Utilization of Health Services&#13;
33.         Indicators of the utilization of health services show an increase of the services&#13;
activity until 1985/1986, followed by a progressive decrease. The total number of&#13;
consultations performed in public sector ambulatory structures was 46,219,500 in 1993 (5.5&#13;
visits for each inhabitant). This activity can be divided between the urban sector with 38.6&#13;
million visits, or 6.7 per inhabitant, and the rural sector with 7.7 million visits, or 2.8 per&#13;
inhabitant. One should note that the number of ambulatory visits has decreased by 29%&#13;
between 1985 and 1993 (by 28% in urban, and by 37% in rural areas). Ambulatory&#13;
consultations are provided in hospitals (approximately 55%), in polyclinics (30%), and in&#13;
Rural Health Centers (15%).&#13;
34.         The number of hospital admissions increased from 1.24 million in 1970 to&#13;
1.82 million in 1986. It then has fallen progressively to 1.58 in 1993. The ratio of&#13;
hospitalized cases to recorded cases of illness is relatively high, showing without doubt an&#13;
incapacity of the primary health services to treat many cases. This appears to be more&#13;
specific for adult (15% of the cases of illness in adults are hospitalized) than for children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(5.9% of the recorded cases of illness are hospitalized), pediatricians managing their charge&#13;
more efficiently. One should perhaps revise this evaluation in the light of factors that were&#13;
insufficiently known to the mission (such as "social" hospitalization of the aged and disabled,&#13;
gratuity of the drugs for hospital patients).&#13;
35.         Table 12 indicates that the decrease in the utilization of health services&#13;
involves the adult patients (-20% recorded cases of illness and -10% hospitalized patients&#13;
between 1986 and 1993) and children (-18% recorded cases and -9% hospitalized patients).&#13;
The decline is more noticeable for ambulatory visits (-29% between 1985 and 1993) than for&#13;
hospitalization (-14%).&#13;
36.         The occupancy rate of hospitals has decreased in the last years. It went down&#13;
from an average of 87% in 1985 to 74% in 1993. This decline has mostly affected District&#13;
and Community hospitals (-23% and -25% respectively). As is usual in most countries, the&#13;
data show in 1993, as in previous years, that the more peripheral and the more specialized&#13;
the structure the lower the occupancy rate becomes. Thus the Medical Schools Hospitals had&#13;
an occupancy rate of 85% in 1993, compared to 68% for the 30 District hospitals, 65% for&#13;
the 91 Community hospitals and only 26% for rural units. One should also note that the&#13;
occupancy rate is maintained at that level only because the average duration of the stay in&#13;
hospital is long (13.8 days).&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
ORGANIZATION AND FINANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.          The Bulgarian health system is characteristic of former socialist economies,&#13;
with: (i) tax-based financing; (ii) public sector provision of services; (iii) universal access to&#13;
comprehensive care; (iv) centralized planning and management; (v) extensive infrastructure&#13;
and staffing; and (vi) few incentives for consumers or providers to increase efficiency,&#13;
control costs and improve the quality of care. Recognizing the positive contribution of the&#13;
public health system to the improvement in health status over the past forty years&#13;
(particularly in combatting infectious diseases), it is nonetheless clear that inefficient&#13;
allocation of resources is limiting the effectiveness of the system in preventing and reversing&#13;
recent declines in health status. The country has embarked on a process of reform of the&#13;
health system, aimed at maintaining broad access to care, while developing alternative&#13;
inancing and reimbursement mechanisms, encouraging private sector health services,&#13;
decentralizing the management of public services, streamlining the public network and&#13;
introducing appropriate incentives for efficiency and quality of care. Reform to date has&#13;
been slow and tentative, as the country struggles to achieve political consensus on the&#13;
direction and pace of change. The Ministry of Health (MOH), responsible for development&#13;
and implementation of health policy, has a formidable task ahead in linking strategic options&#13;
to agreed objectives, and building a national consensus through public awareness and social&#13;
marketing of proposed reforms.&#13;
II. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEME    OF HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
2.          The public sector health system is organized along the lines of district and&#13;
municipal administration. The territory consists of 27 districts plus the capital city,&#13;
encompassing more than 270 municipalities. It has been decided to group the 27 districts&#13;
into nine larger regions, but no administrative structure is in place to operationalize this&#13;
decision. The hierarchy of public health facilities consists of: (i) rural health posts, district&#13;
health centers and urban polyclinics (freestanding and hospital-based) for ambulatory care;&#13;
(ii) municipal hospitals (250-300 beds each) and district hospitals (1,000 beds each) for&#13;
secondary care; and (iii) medical academies and a wide variety of specialized hospitals and&#13;
institutes for tertiary care. The public sector health system also includes an extensive, but&#13;
poorly performing, network of emergency medical services (EMS), and a network of 27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -           Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 16&#13;
district and four regional Blood Transfusion Centers. The health information system is&#13;
maintained by the National Center for Health Information (NCHI)and its 28 district offices,&#13;
while public health, environmental concerns and food safety are addressed through national&#13;
and district-based Sanitary and Epidemiologic Inspectorates. In addition, parallel health&#13;
systems, including both ambulatory and inpatient facilities, are maintained by the Ministries&#13;
of Transport, Interior, Labor and Defense. Although these systems are financed&#13;
predominantly out of general revenues, they are restricted to specific social or occupational&#13;
groups (e.g. transport workers). Private sector health services were authorized in 1991.&#13;
Private services have grown rapidly in the pharmaceutical sector (para. 12) and in dentristry,&#13;
with the establishment of approximately 1,700 private pharmacies and 6,000 private dentists.&#13;
The development of other types of private medical services has been slowed by, among other&#13;
factors, the lack of an appropriate financing mechanism.&#13;
3.          Thus far, the most fundamental reform of the Bulgarian health system is&#13;
contained in the 1991 Law on Municipal Autonomy which decentralized management and&#13;
financing of district-based health facilities to the municipalities in which they are located.&#13;
Even district hospitals and district-based, specialized institutes, both of which have catchment&#13;
areas extending beyond a single municipality, fall under the jurisdiction of the municipality in&#13;
which they are located. Many regulations hampering municipal management of facilities&#13;
have been abolished in recent years. A municipal Commission on Health Care, consisting of&#13;
health and social welfare personnel elected by the population, has responsibility for&#13;
management of the municipal health system, and reports directly to the Municipal Council.&#13;
District health authorities reporting directly to the MOH have a much diminished role&#13;
relative to the past, with the Regional Center for Health Information serving as a conduit for&#13;
information from the local level to the center. District-based health facilities have the legal&#13;
status of municipal enterprises, limiting their managerial and financial autonomy. For&#13;
example, while hospital directors have been granted some flexibility in staffing decisions,&#13;
they must work within a fixed wage envelope determined by municipal authorities which&#13;
cannot be reallocated to non-wage expenditures. National-level institutes and hospitals have&#13;
the status of autonomous public enterprises--with some falling under the supervision of the&#13;
MOH.&#13;
4.          District and municipal health services are financed almost exclusively from a&#13;
Municipal Budget (MB) which is distinct from the central, or Republican Budget (RB).&#13;
While municipalities do have a limited tax base of their own, tax administration in Bulgaria&#13;
is largely centralized, and the Municipal Budget is dominated by transfers from central&#13;
budgetary revenues. A key issue following the decentralization of health system management&#13;
has been the need to match resources at the municipal level with health care responsibilities,&#13;
particularly when catchment areas extend beyond a single municipality. Measures to ensure&#13;
this have thus far been inadequate (para. 19). Furthermore, economic contraction during the&#13;
initial stage of the transition has imposed severe resource constraints on the health system--&#13;
particularly at the municipal level. In many municipalities, more than half of the municipal&#13;
budget is allocated to health services. In a highly resource-constrained environment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -           Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
municipal authorities are seeling ways to consolidate and restructure the public system and&#13;
reallocate resources toward more cost-effective health interventions. However, structural&#13;
reform at the municipal level has been hampered by: (i) lack of clear policy directives from&#13;
the center; (ii) unclear legislative authority to take decisions on restructuring and&#13;
reallocation; and (iii) lack of experience in using financial and service utilization data to&#13;
make managerial decisions.&#13;
5.           Increasing the efficiency of resource use in the public health system will&#13;
require greater managerial autonomy for health facilities and the restructuring of financial&#13;
incentives through the development of new cost reimbursement mechanisms. The MOH&#13;
intends to promote these objectives through use of a contracting system between health&#13;
facilities and municipalities (in an initial stage) and among health facilities, the proposed&#13;
health financing administration and municipalities or client groups (in a later stage). Such a&#13;
system would require, inter alia, change in the legal status of health facilities and&#13;
development of cost parameters on which to base reimbursement. The NCHI has&#13;
spearheaded an effort to develop simple cost accounting in municipal and district hospitals&#13;
and determine the cost basis for health care reimbursement (para. 20). Pilot activities to test&#13;
contractual arrangements and develop reimbursement mechanisms are proposed, and should&#13;
be pursued in tandem with efforts to revise the legal and regulatory framework for&#13;
ownership, management and financing of public and private health services.&#13;
Public Sector Health Infrastructure&#13;
6.          Hospital Care. The public sector health system in Bulgaria is plagued with:&#13;
(i) excess capacity; (ii) poor differentiation of services for ambulatory, emergency and&#13;
inpatient care; and, in recent years; (iii) declining utilization rates. With 12.8 hospital beds&#13;
per 1,000 population (10.3 acute care beds and 2.5 sanitoria/rehabilitation beds), inpatient&#13;
capacity is high by European standards--and all the more so given Bulgaria's income level&#13;
(Tables 1 and 2). The situation has scarcely improved during the transition. Inpatient&#13;
capacity in sanatoria and other rehabilitation centers fell by 15 percent in the 1990-92 period,&#13;
but capacity in acute care hospitals fell by less than one percent. Bulgarian hospitals tend to&#13;
have more separate wards for sub-specialties than comparable hospitals in Western Europe,&#13;
and occupancy rates are frequently low. Although capacity is excessive, facilities tend to be&#13;
old and poorly maintained, with obsolete technology and--as the fiscal crisis deepens--&#13;
shortages of spare parts, medical supplies and drugs. This is especially true at the municipal&#13;
level and in rural areas, where budget constraints have been tightest. The resulting decline&#13;
in the quality of care is undoubtedly one factor accounting for the fall in average occupancy&#13;
rate, from 87 percent in 1985 to 73 percent in 1992. Occupancy rates have dropped furthest&#13;
for district and municipal hospitals (to 73 and 69 percent, respectively, in 1992), and are&#13;
extremely low for rural hospitals (22 percent). This is so, despite a long average length of&#13;
stay (13.8 days) in hospitals, which boosts occupancy figures but is indicative of&#13;
inefficiencies in inpatient care.&#13;
&#13;

7.          Outpatient Care. Although hospitalization rates have declined in recent&#13;
years, the ratio of hospitalizations to cases of illness remains relatively high, most probably&#13;
reflecting the failure of outpatient services to effectively treat patients. Indeed, utilization of&#13;
outpatient facilities has fallen far more dramatically than hospital use. Outpatient visits per&#13;
capita rose from 5.0 in 1970 to 7.3 in 1985, before declining steadily to only 5.3 in 1992.&#13;
Large disparities exist between use of outpatient services in urban areas (6.9 visits per capita)&#13;
and rural areas (2.9 visits per capita). The primary care network is extensive, with one&#13;
ambulatory care center per 2,300 population in 1992. However, nearly 60 percent of these&#13;
are rural health posts with limited access to essential drugs and supplies. In fact, primary&#13;
care services in Bulgaria tend to be poorly differentiated from emergency medical services,&#13;
and the country lacks effective "front line" family medicine, particularly in rural areas. As a&#13;
result, hospitals provide a disproportionate share of primary health services--one reason&#13;
hospitals account for 55 percent of all outpatient visits (urban polyclinics provide another 30&#13;
percent). In coming years, high priority must be accorded to the strengthening of "front&#13;
line" preventive and curative primary care services in both the public and private sector, in&#13;
order to reverse deteriorating health status and avoid using hospitals as costly providers of&#13;
routine primary care.&#13;
8.          Emergency Care. Strengthening the front line will depend on disentangling&#13;
routine primary health services from emergency care, and making emergency medical&#13;
services (EMS) a fast and reliable link between primary and secondary facilities. Among the&#13;
weaknesses of the existing EMS are:&#13;
a.    unclear mandate which covers emergency care, routine primary health care,&#13;
home visits and miscellaneous transport needs;&#13;
b.    decentralized administration;&#13;
c.    poor integration between mobile services and hospital emergency wards;&#13;
d.    lack of polyvalent emergency rooms;&#13;
e.    oversized, obsolete and unreliable ambulance fleet; and,&#13;
f.   inappropriate staffing patterns, with overspecialized physicians and&#13;
undertrained paramedical staff.&#13;
To rectify this situation, the MOH intends to strengthen EMS through: (i) recentralization of&#13;
EMS administration; (ii) development of an integrated telecommunications system;&#13;
(iii) downsizing and upgrading of the ambulance fleet; (iv) redeployment and retraining of&#13;
staff; (v) reorganization and reequipment of emergency rooms; and (vi) revising emergency&#13;
medicine curricula.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Health Personnel&#13;
9.          Table 3 summarizes the recent evolution of staffing levels in the public sector&#13;
health system. The total number of personnel (not including MOH personnel) fell by eight&#13;
percent in the 1990-92 period, to around 117,000. All categories of staff declined, with the&#13;
number of physicians falling least (5 percent) and the number of pharnacists and pharmacy&#13;
assistants falling most (40 and 23 percent, respectively). These figures are in keeping with&#13;
the establishment of approximately 1,700 private pharmacies in Bulgaria by end-1993. It is&#13;
also believed that most of the nearly 1,500 physicians to leave public service are in private&#13;
practice in Bulgaria or abroad.&#13;
10.         With 3.1 physicians per 1,000 population and 2.4 nursing persons (nurses,&#13;
midwives, feldchers) per physician, medical staffing levels are in the upper range for&#13;
European countries, and more than adequate to address the needs of the population (Table 2).&#13;
However, medical staff tend to be poorly and/or inappropriately trained to meet the basic&#13;
health care needs of the population. Eighty percent of physicians are specialists (including&#13;
14 percent pediatricians and 6 percent gynecologists), with most of the remaining generalists&#13;
studying towards their specialization. Medical education lacks a family medicine curriculum&#13;
and produces no general practitioners--although more than 40 percent of physicians work at&#13;
the primary care level. Likewise, nurses are not trained as nurse practitioners. Pre-service&#13;
and in-service training in family medicine, coupled with better supply of essential drugs to&#13;
peripheral areas, will be the key to improved quality of primary health care in coming years.&#13;
11.         Average wages for public sector health personnel have traditionally trailed&#13;
behind average wages in the formal economy, but rose by approximately 20 percent in real&#13;
terms between 1989 and 1992. Wage and employment policy is determined through&#13;
negotiation between the MOH and the trade unions representing health personnel. AR staff&#13;
reduction and redeployment must be negotiated with the trade unions, which are entitled to&#13;
participate in all management decisions of health facilities. The most recent Sector&#13;
Agreement (April 1993) establishes wage rates for five categories of health facilities based on&#13;
coefficients applied to an adjusted minimum salary. The base pay scale is quite flat, with a&#13;
maximum salary of only 2.7 times the minimum. However, bonuses for advanced degrees,&#13;
specializations, seniority and specific fields (e.g. surgery, anaesthesiology, emergency care)&#13;
add as much as 70 percent or more to base salaries. Within the framework of the Sector&#13;
Agreement, the MOH establishes an average gross wage for all municipally-funded facilites&#13;
which then determines the budgetary envelope for the MB wagebill. In addition,&#13;
municipalities have the right to increase the average gross wage for health (and education)&#13;
personnel by as much as 20 percent as an added incentive, using municipal resources or&#13;
savings generated within municipal transfers. For 1994, the average gross wage in force for&#13;
municipally-funded facilities is 3,344 BGL/month. For tertiary facilities funded by the&#13;
Republican Budget, the average gross wage established ranges from 4,300-4,800 BGL/month&#13;
depending on the facility. Including various bonuses, specialized physicians in tertiary care&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -          Annex 3&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
facilities may earn 7,000-10,000 BGL/month, which is 2.0-2.5 times that of a physician in a&#13;
primary health center.&#13;
Pharmaceutical MArket&#13;
12.         During the socialist era, the State had a monopoly on pharmaceutical&#13;
production, import-export and distribution in Bulgaria. In 1991, the market was liberalized,&#13;
including: (i) authorization of private sector importers, wholesalers and retailers;&#13;
(ii) dissolution of public sector production facilities into 20 independent, state-owned&#13;
factories; (iii) dissolution of public sector distribution facilties into 28 state-owned district&#13;
wholesalers; and (iv) authorization for health facilities to purchase drugs on the open market.&#13;
As a result of these measures, the private sector has grown quickly--a largely positive&#13;
development--albeit in a virtually unregulated manner. Procurement by the public sector has&#13;
become highly fragmented, resulting in inefficiencies due to small volume purchases, poor&#13;
market information and general inexperience at the facility level. The number of registered&#13;
substances and dosage forms has increased threefold (nearly 1,000 substances and 3,600&#13;
dosage forms by end-1993) due to a surge in imports, while domestic drug industries have&#13;
sought bigger profits and foreign exchange earnings by exporting 80 percent of their&#13;
production.&#13;
13.         Pricing policy for pharmaceuticals is evolving. Prices on domestic production&#13;
are loosely controlled in the domestic market (cost plus 20 percent margin). Price controls&#13;
in the domestic market add to incentives to export at uncontrolled prices. Import prices are&#13;
not controlled, but internal distribution margins for imported drugs were regulated (3 percent&#13;
for import handling, 25 percent for wholesale/retail distribution) starting in 1993. Use of ad&#13;
valorem margins, however, adds to incentives to market more expensive drugs and dosage&#13;
forms. Reimbursement policy has also fueled cost escalation. The state reimburses 100&#13;
percent of drug costs in inpatient facilites and 25-100 percent for drugs bought in public and&#13;
private pharmacies, depending on the substance. In addition, the state reimburses 100&#13;
percent of drug costs for households below the poverty line, and 50 percent of drug costs for&#13;
households between 100 and 130 percent of the poverty line. No cap is placed on state&#13;
reimbursement for specific drugs, encouraging the use of more expensive brands and dosage&#13;
forms. Reimbursement mechanisms have also not kept pace with development of the private&#13;
market: private pharmacies submit invoices for reimbursement through hospital pharmacies--&#13;
an inappropriate administrative burden for public hospitals.&#13;
14.         The National Drug Institute (NDI), charged with implementation of drug&#13;
policy, regulation of the market and drug registration, quality control and inspection,&#13;
suggests that existing reimbursement policy is both overly complex and fiscally&#13;
unsustainable. The state covered nearly 75 percent of the cost of the BGL 3.8 billion spent&#13;
on drugs in 1992, amounting to about 17 percent of public health expenditures. This is a&#13;
relatively high share by international standards, and fiscal contraction in 1993 and 1994 have&#13;
strained the capacity of the state to maintain drug expenditures, resulting in payment delays&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 1 1-           Annex 3&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
and drug shortages. Improving the cost-effectiveness of drug expenditures will be a high&#13;
priority for the NDI in coming years. A new Drug Law establishing the basic regulatory&#13;
framework for the pharmaceutical market has been submitted to Parliament, and awaits&#13;
action. In addition, the MOH intends to take measures aimed at: (i) capping drug&#13;
reimbursement rates; (ii) developing appropriate administrative mechanisms for&#13;
reimbursement; (iii) promoting rational drug use; and (iv) establishing a bulk procurement&#13;
capability within the public sector,&#13;
m. FINANCING OF HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
15.         Health services in Bulgaria are financed almost entirely from general tax&#13;
revenues allocated via the budget, with 2-3 percent of revenues deriving from out-of-pocket&#13;
user fees (mostly for pharmaceuticals). Budget allocations are based largely on historic&#13;
levels which tend to reflect fixed and quasi-fixed inputs: number of facilities, beds and staff.&#13;
Ailocations do not reflect anticipated service volume, nor have they been adjusted to take&#13;
into account shifting pattems of service utilization in recent years. At the municipal level,&#13;
municipal transfers have historically been the subject of political negotiation, and have not&#13;
necessarily reflected the changing needs of the health system, and shifting pattems of facility&#13;
use.&#13;
Revenue and Reimbursement Mechanisms&#13;
16.         Tax-based health systems offer the advantages of facilitating universal access&#13;
to care and minimizing financial risk for health care consumers. However, the existing&#13;
budgeting system for public health facilities in Bulgaria suffers from the following&#13;
weaknesses: (i) few incentives for cost consciousness among consumers, who pay no out-of-&#13;
pocket costs for care; (ii) no transfer of financial risk (or reward) to providers in order to&#13;
create incentives to improve efficiency, consolidate redundant services and improve quality to&#13;
attract clientele; and (iii) no reimbursement mechanism for private services which would&#13;
permit private sector development. Fiscal contraction in recent years has also sparked a&#13;
search for new sources of revenue to finance health services. Initially, adoption of&#13;
contributory national health insurance legislation tended to be viewed as a panacea for these&#13;
problems. Various interest groups compromised on draft legislation which was submitted to&#13;
Parliament in 1993. However, the initial draft raises two fundamental questions: (i) the&#13;
feasibility of a contribution-based insurance system in the present Bulgarian context; and&#13;
(ii) the administrative practicality of a decentralized institutional framework.&#13;
17.         The draft Health Insurance Law establishes a system which is ostensibly&#13;
financed predominantly from payroll contributions. However, payroll contributions in&#13;
Bulgaria already account for nearly 60 percent of gross wage payments--a very high rate&#13;
which significantly distorts the cost of labor in the economy. Increasing this rate to 68-72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -            Annex 3&#13;
Page 9 of 16&#13;
percent--a conservative estimate of the cost of health services--would be unacceptable in any&#13;
country, but all the more so in a country facing the social pressure of mounting&#13;
unemployment associated with the economic transition. Additional payroll taxation does not&#13;
represent a source of significant financing for the health system. Initially, the Health&#13;
Insurance Law proposed the establishment of 28 independent, non-profit insurance companies&#13;
with territorial monopolies for compulsory insurance. However, it was ultimately recognized&#13;
that their risk pools would be too small for optimal risk-sharing. Revised legislation has&#13;
subsequently proposed the establishment of one national insurance company, with 28&#13;
branches. However, the issue of excessive payroll taxation has not been adequately&#13;
addressed.&#13;
18.         The proposed insurance legislation provides a framework for health financing,&#13;
without defining specific reimbursement mechanisms. Some type of contracting between&#13;
providers and insurers is assumed, and yet, it is the development of new reimbursement&#13;
mechanisms which will determine the incentives for increased efficiency, improved quality of&#13;
care and development of private health services. Without first defining these reimbursement&#13;
mechanisms, it is difficult to assess the impact of introducing health insurance on the demand&#13;
and supply of services, and on public spending for health. Indeed, legitimate concerns about&#13;
uncontrolled cost escalation--particularly at a time of severe fiscal austerity--have reduced the&#13;
political urgency of adopting health insurance legislation. In the meantime, the Ministries of&#13;
Health and Finance, as well as the National Center for Health Information (NCHI) and the&#13;
National Insurance Research and Development Center (NIRDC) have begun to define and&#13;
test new reimbursement mechanisms for health services.&#13;
19.         In the absence of more fundamental financial reform, the Ministries of Health&#13;
and Finance have sought to improve the existing system of municipal budgeting by&#13;
developing "objective criteria" to determine municipal transfers. However, political&#13;
opposition to changing historic transfer levels has been strong, and the logic guiding the&#13;
chosen methodology is unclear. Furthermore, while the methodology determines the global&#13;
envelope of transfers to each municipality, it does nothing to change the incentives facing&#13;
health facilities and other municipal services--a change that can only occur through&#13;
development of new reimbursement mechanisms. According to the methodology, municipal&#13;
transfers are determined by: (i) historic levels adjusted for inflation; (ii) capital investments&#13;
(proposed by the municipality); (iii) per capita income in the municipality; and (iv) a&#13;
weighted set of 17 "objective criteria". The set of criteria is heavily weighted (63 percent)&#13;
toward three factors: population, number of settlements and number of secondary school&#13;
students. Ratios of patients per bed in municipal and district hospitals account for 13 percent&#13;
of the weighting. Overall, the rationale behind the numerous criteria and their weighting is&#13;
unclear. However, the objective criteria applied to only 11 percent of the aggregate&#13;
municipal transfer in 1994, resulting in little reallocation of resources relative to the past.&#13;
20.         Efforts to rationalize municipal transfers should be pursued, with an improved&#13;
methodology. In general, municipal budgets should be based directly on unit costs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113 -           Annex 3&#13;
Page 10 of 16&#13;
municipal services provided (e.g. cost of secondary education per pupil, per household cost&#13;
of trash collection, etc.). Similarly, for municipal health services, budgets should reflect&#13;
activity levels--reimbursing for services rendered--with phasing out of underutilized and/or&#13;
redundant facilities and services. In fact, the public health system has the necessary cost and&#13;
utilization data to develop a more flexible budgeting system based on services rendered and&#13;
identify necessary streamlining of the system. For the past few years, the NCHI has&#13;
introduced simple cost accounting (by ward and by expenditure category) in municipal and&#13;
district hospitals and polyclinics to complement patient and utilization data traditionally&#13;
collected for the health information system. While the financial accounting system is in an&#13;
early phase--with associated problems of data reliability and data processing capabilities-it&#13;
does provide a sufficient basis for calculating average costs, developing simple, cost-based&#13;
reimbursement mechanisms and making efficiency comparisons. The NCHI intends to carry&#13;
out pilot activities to improve district resource allocation, by using existing financial and&#13;
service utilization data to: (i) identify the potential for streamlining public health services;&#13;
and (ii) develop reimbursement mechanisms which create financial incentives for efficient&#13;
resource allocation.&#13;
21.         Building on the work of the NCHI, the NIRDC has outlined a medium-term&#13;
strategy to introduce a case-mix, diagnosis-related approach to hospital reimbursement,&#13;
based on grouping of patients according to ICD-9 categories. Initially, patients would be&#13;
grouped by ward only, with reimbursement based on average unit costs per ward.&#13;
Gradually, diagnostic groups would be separated from the ward groupings, with&#13;
reimbursement based on average cost of treatment. Successful implementation of such a&#13;
system will require refinement of the cost accounting system, strengthening of financial&#13;
analysis and development of more complex administrative mechanisms. Financial and&#13;
technical support from the international community is being sought for medium term&#13;
development of this reimbursement mechanism. At the same time, more attention should be&#13;
focused on the relatively easier task of developing a reimbursement mechanism for outpatient&#13;
family practice, in order to strengthen primary care and support the emergence of private&#13;
sector general practitioners.&#13;
Trends in Health EWenditures&#13;
22.         As in other former socialist countries, the initial phase of the transition has&#13;
entailed economic and fiscal contraction, with gross domestic product falling by 25 percent&#13;
and government spending by 40 percent in real terms between 1989 and 1993. Despite this&#13;
unprecedented contraction, the Government succeeded in maintaining--and even moderately&#13;
increasing (by seven percent)--aggregrate real spending for health during this period&#13;
(Table 4). This is in marked contrast to most other former socialist economies, where&#13;
economic contraction has resulted, to varying degrees, in compression of real health&#13;
expenditures. As a result, public spending for health rose as a share of GDP from 3.4&#13;
percent in 1989 to 5.4 percent in 1992--a level which is not high by Western European&#13;
standards, but is in the upper range for countries at Bulgaria's income level. Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -           Annex 3&#13;
Page 11 of 16&#13;
magnitude of the general fiscal contraction, health expenditures more than doubled as a share&#13;
of government spending, from 5.8 percent in 1989 to 11.9 percent in 1992. However,&#13;
Bulgaria could not sustain this level of health expenditures as the transition deepened. Fiscal&#13;
pressures have made spending cuts inevitable, with public spending on health falling as a&#13;
share of GDP to 5.1 percent in 1993 and 4.7% of GDP in 1994.&#13;
23.         All growth in real spending for health in the 1989-93 period was for current&#13;
expenditures. An initial surge in the wagebill was tempered in later years, while spending&#13;
for drugs, operating costs and other goods and services increased moderately, peaking in&#13;
1992. In contrast, capital spending, including rehabilitation and new investment, declined by&#13;
around 20 percent in real terms. Virtually all expenditure categories experienced cutbacks in&#13;
1993 and 1994. Reductions were ad hoc in nature, with little restructuring of the public&#13;
health system. The challenge for Government in the next few years will be to selectively&#13;
maintain public spending in those areas which have the greatest impact on the health status of&#13;
the population, while eliminating inefficient and ineffective uses of public resources.&#13;
24.         Of greatest concern for the health status of the population is the fact that all&#13;
growth in health spending in recent years has accrued exclusively to the Republican Budget,&#13;
which supports specialized tertiary care and health administration. Spending for the&#13;
Republican Budget increased by 60 percent in real terms between 1989 and 1992, while&#13;
spending for the Municipal Budget--which supports more cost-effective primary and&#13;
secondary care--virtually stagnated.Y As a result, municipal spending fell as a share of total&#13;
health expenditures from 81 percent in 1989 to 72 percent in 1992. This at a time when&#13;
resources need to be shifted into basic health services, which have the greatest impact on&#13;
health status and the greatest potential to protect vulnerable groups from disease and&#13;
premature death during the transition. Failure to restructure and streamline the public sector&#13;
health infrastructure at all levels has hindered the reallocation of resources toward more cost-&#13;
effective interventions. The trend in spending was reversed in 1993, with real expenditures&#13;
under the Republican Budget falling by eight percent, and municipal spending increasing by&#13;
seven percent. However, this reversal does not entirely compensate for past trends, leaving&#13;
relative spending for the Municipal Budget well below pre-transition levels.&#13;
25.         Given the severity of revenue shortfalls, it is remarkable that Government&#13;
maintained--and even modestly increased--real spending in health throughout the 1989-93&#13;
period. Investment spending alone suffered significant real declines--a not wholly&#13;
undesirable outcome, given the nature of the investments which have been selected. The&#13;
public investment program during the transition has been a hodge-podge of inappropriate&#13;
projects, not subject to objective economic and social evaluation criteria. The 1993 "priority"&#13;
investment program consisted almost entirely of construction and completion of specialized&#13;
I' This is true after adjusting for the transfer of certain health services (e.g. Regional Centers for Health&#13;
Information, Regional Sanitary Inspectorates) to the Republican budget, beginning in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -          Annex 3&#13;
Page 12 of 16&#13;
tertiary care hospitals and secondary hospitals for parallel health systems with restricted&#13;
access (e.g. transport workers only). If completed, the 1993 program would have added at&#13;
least 1,500-2,000 hospital beds to existing, underutilized inpatient capacity. New investment&#13;
needs to be linked to rationalization of existing infrastructure. As it now stands,the program&#13;
is an amalgam of special interest projects proposed by municipalities and the medical&#13;
community, with the Ministries of Health and Finance playing no role in the selection of&#13;
investments which are most cost-effective (i.e. produce the greatest improvement in health&#13;
status for the least cost). This is unfortunate, for the investment needs of the sector are&#13;
great, in order to strengthen front line primary care, rehabilitate emergency and blood supply&#13;
services and upgrade outmoded hospital equipment. Despite a justifiable tendency toward&#13;
decentralization in the management of the public health sector, it will be important in coming&#13;
years to recognize the legitimate role of the central government (in this case, the Ministries&#13;
of Health and Finance) in establishing public investment policy and applying objective&#13;
criteria for arbitrage among competing investment proposals.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
MINISTRY OF HEALTH&#13;
STATEMENT OF POLICY DIRECTIONS&#13;
FOR HEALTH SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Policy Objectives&#13;
1.   The health policy of Ministry of Health (MoH) will be directed&#13;
towards the achievement of the following priority objectives:&#13;
a.   Protect and improve the health status of the population with&#13;
regard to specific risk groups;&#13;
b.   Restructure the health care system based on primary health&#13;
care aimed at improving the health status and encourage a&#13;
healthy lifestyle as well as improve the health system&#13;
performance;&#13;
c.   Further develop the structural reform in the health sector in&#13;
conformity with the elaborated National Health Strategy;&#13;
d.   Guarantee equal access, equity and justice in the health care&#13;
for all citizens.&#13;
2.   Health care policy shall preserve its social character and it is aimed at&#13;
improving peoples' health , preventing diseases, improving the efficiency of&#13;
health care by improving the quality of services and achieving a just&#13;
allocation of resources. During the process of implementing it is essential to&#13;
maintain the political and social trust of the people in the health care&#13;
reform.&#13;
3.   In this respect the achievement of a balance between rapid and&#13;
tangible results in certain essential health care fields will be essential.&#13;
&#13;

Strategyfor reform&#13;
4.   To achieve the objectives of health policy MoH has finalized a&#13;
National Health Strategy based on in-depth analysis of the exsting&#13;
situation, problems and priority areas for action in the health sector. A&#13;
further step in this respect will be the development of a National Action&#13;
Plan for the implementation of the strategy. The MoH has focused its&#13;
activities based on the following priority areas:&#13;
* reduction of cardio-vascular diseases;&#13;
* improving the prevention and treatment of neoplasms;&#13;
* reduction of infant mortality;&#13;
. improving the care for the aged population, the handicapped and the&#13;
unemployed&#13;
* protecting the health of women in reproductive age&#13;
In order to achieve progress in the a.m. priority areas coordination action&#13;
will be taken in the prevention of diseases, health promotion, PHC,&#13;
environmental health, women's health, perinatal care, blood transfusion and&#13;
other fields.&#13;
5.   The MoH is undertaking a legislative initiative to provide legal&#13;
grounds and regulations of the health sector reform activities. This initiative&#13;
includes the elaboration of new laws, amendments to the existing legislation&#13;
and development of new regulatory acts related to:&#13;
* management of health system&#13;
* hospital management&#13;
* health care financing&#13;
* the status of non-governmental medical associations&#13;
* private practice&#13;
* health promotion and disease prevention&#13;
* drug policy&#13;
6.   The process of change in the health system is aimed at promoting&#13;
more efficient and effective utilization of the resources allocated to meet&#13;
health demands. In this sense the change should be perceived as an&#13;
adaptation and restructuring of the existing health care system, taking into&#13;
account new quantitative or qualitative requirements. It is essential that this&#13;
process covers the demand for new financial, technical or technological&#13;
resources.&#13;

Restructuring of the health system&#13;
The effectiveness and efficiency of health care will be improved through the&#13;
restructuring and upgrading of the health system in order to adequately&#13;
adapt the country's health care institutions' infrastructure in accordance&#13;
with the modified health and demographic status of the population, the&#13;
decentralization process and the introduction of a health insurance system.&#13;
With respect to the system as a whole, the following measures have been or&#13;
will be taken:&#13;
a.   Creation of Regional health authorities. Such regional bodies&#13;
have been created with the decree No. 145 of COM published&#13;
in State Gazette of 17.07.95 named as Regional Health&#13;
Centers.&#13;
b.   A uniform hospital management model was established aimed&#13;
at increased responsibility and accountability for performing&#13;
the management functions in an environment of greater&#13;
autonomy.&#13;
c.   Pilot projects started in 2 regions of the country (Smolyan and&#13;
Gabrovo) with the aim of introducing and testing basic&#13;
elements of a health insurance system.&#13;
d.   Re-establishment of the National Public Health Center and the&#13;
National Center for Health Promotion is foreseen in the near&#13;
future.&#13;
7.  In addition, the MoH will undertake other activities outlined in the&#13;
National Health Strategy (NHS) (a copy of which is supplied to the WB&#13;
administration). The sequence in order and time of those activities will be&#13;
given in the National Action Plan (NAP).&#13;
8.   Provision of high-priority, basic health services will be ensured&#13;
through restructuring and upgrading of the key networks outlined below.&#13;
Prim=r Health care&#13;
9.   On May 31st 1994, the MoH issued ordinance no. 10, distinguishing&#13;
primary health care services from emergency medical services and defining&#13;
their respective roles in providing 24-hour care. Starting this year the MoH&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -                  Amex4&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
will contract with the municipalities to upgrade basic equipment and&#13;
facilities for primary care and provide training in general practice medicine&#13;
and community health, contingent on municipal commitment to:&#13;
a.   rationalize PHC coverage through adjustments in infrastructure&#13;
and staffing, with particular regard for underserved areas;&#13;
b.  implement a standard PHC package including 24-hour curative&#13;
care, a range of freventive services related to maternal and&#13;
child health and other preventive and promotive activities&#13;
according to national disease priorities;&#13;
These commitments will be adapted to the needs of each municipality.&#13;
Commitment contracts will be signed with approximately 75 municipalities&#13;
to carry out these activities in the next 5 years.&#13;
Emergency Medical Services&#13;
10.  The COM  issued a decree on 17.02.1994 to create a centralized&#13;
emergency medical service (EMS) under national authority in an initial 7&#13;
districts (ordinance no. 37). A second decree was approved by COM on&#13;
29.09.1994 to extend this to an additional 7 districts, and Government&#13;
intends to progressively establish a centralized EMS administration nation-&#13;
wide. The MoH also issued ordinance no. 7 on 25.05.1994 to define the&#13;
structure and functions of EMS centers and establish the legal framework&#13;
for their operation. The MoH has begun signing separation protocols with&#13;
municipalities to transfer local EMS assets (vehicles, staff, equipment) to&#13;
central authorities. This is a prerequisite to an ongoing program for&#13;
restructuring and upgrading of EMS which will:&#13;
a.   eliminate non-emergency, routine primary care and home-visits&#13;
from EMS;&#13;
b.   set up a modem EMS telecommunications network;&#13;
c.   establish and equip polyvalent emergency rooms;&#13;
d.   downsize and modernize the ambulance fleet, and adjust staff&#13;
accordingly;&#13;
e.  improve integration of mobile services and hospital emergency&#13;
rooms;&#13;

Blood Transfusion&#13;
11. As a first step in a programme to improve the supply and safety of&#13;
blood and blood products, Parliament passed the law on Blood Collection&#13;
and Transfusion on 30.03.94, establishing standards for the collection,&#13;
processing and transfusion of blood. At the same time, the MoH improved&#13;
the safety of the blood supply and adopted more efficient technology for the&#13;
blood collection by replacing glass bottles with plastic bags throughout the&#13;
system. MoH is now prepariig a decree to establish a centralized blood&#13;
transfusion network and transfer associated assets from the municipalities to&#13;
the central authorities. This is a part of a planned strategy to restructure and&#13;
rehabilitate the blood transfusion network which will:&#13;
a.   concentrate most blood processing and quality control activities in 5&#13;
Regional Transfusion Centers, downsizing the network by lirniting&#13;
smaller centers to blood collection functions only (phasing out other&#13;
functions and adjusting staff accordingly);&#13;
b.   upgrade the equipment and technology for blood collection and&#13;
processing in line with Council of Europe standards;&#13;
c.   re-organize the National Donor Recruitment program with non-&#13;
governmental involvement, and improve public relations techniques.&#13;
Health Fian&#13;
12.  Reform of health financing will seek to mobilize and increase the&#13;
efficiency of the existing health resources by adapting the health sector to&#13;
the new conditions of a market economy and budgetary constraints. To&#13;
begin this process, amendments to the existing Public Health Law are&#13;
prepared.&#13;
13.  A new draft Law on Health Insurance establishing the broad outlines&#13;
for a contributory national health insurance system will be finalized soon&#13;
and presented to Parliament. In order to better define the modalities for the&#13;
implementation of such a system the following activities are underway:&#13;
a.   MoH has approved a proposal for various methods of contracting the&#13;
amount and quality of medical services and their payment between&#13;
the consumers and providers of health care;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
-126-                     Page 6 of 7&#13;
b.   a system of cost accounting by department and type of expenditure&#13;
has been introduced on a pilot basis in municipal level in-patient and&#13;
out-patient facilities;&#13;
c.   simple efficiency comparisons are being made on the basis of costs&#13;
data, and a link has been established between budgetary allocations&#13;
and service volume.&#13;
14.  In the next few years the capacity of MoH to analyze policy options&#13;
related to health finance and management will be strengthened while&#13;
reform will focus on:&#13;
a.   updating the existing health statistics information system and&#13;
facilities-based management information systems in accordance with&#13;
modern standards and streamlining the national health information&#13;
administration;&#13;
b.   short-term development of a flexible budgeting method to be adopted&#13;
by the Ministry of Finance for municipal and national level health&#13;
facilities which will explicitly link public resource allocation to the&#13;
volume of services rendered;   -&#13;
c.  longer-term development of case-mix, diagnosis-related method of&#13;
reimbursement for health services which will link resource allocation&#13;
to service volume as well as provide maximum incentives for&#13;
efficiency and cost-containment;&#13;
d.   defining the resource base (pay-roll contributions, budgetary&#13;
revenues, user fees etc.) expenditure (minimum package of insured&#13;
services) and contracting methods of a national health insurance&#13;
system;&#13;
e.   building the capacity and the authority of the MoH to evaluate and&#13;
select public investment proposals (at the central and municipal&#13;
levels) according to cost-effectiveness criteria;&#13;
f.   introduction of new postgraduate training system for experts having&#13;
higher or special medical education, which would include training in&#13;
health administration, management and marketing.&#13;
&#13;

Concluding Remarks&#13;
15.  The new health care strategy requires shared responsibilities for the&#13;
development of the health sector and the application of practical&#13;
mechanisms of real partnership between the state institutions, the public&#13;
organizations and the health experts. Implementation of the strategy must&#13;
be spearheaded by every department of the MoH, which must internalize&#13;
the strategic aims and objectives, and take responsibility for acting upon&#13;
them.&#13;
16.  It is oriented toward the maximum utilization of the experience of the&#13;
developed countries, international institutions and organizations in the field&#13;
of health care and the implementation of the financial resources and know-&#13;
how provided by the latter.&#13;
17.  The achievement of the above defined aims and the implementation&#13;
of a health insurance system should guarantee high quality and accessible&#13;
health services for the Bulgarian population with the possibility of free&#13;
choice of physicians and medical institutions, and professional fulfillment&#13;
and an honored position in society for the medical community.&#13;

            Bulgaria - Health Sector Restructuring Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Health Sector
            Restructuring Project is to prevent further deterioration in
            the health status of the population, while at the same time
            improving the efficiency of the health care delivery system.
            The project comprises four main components: (i) policy
            analysis and management which will primarily assist the
            Ministry of Health (MOH) in building up a capacity for
            policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited
            number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis
            and cost-effectiveness studies; (ii) primary health care
            which will improve the quality and scope of primary health
            care in selected municipalities; (iii) emergency medical
            services which will support ongoing efforts by MOH to
            restructure emergency medical services and improve the
            effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery; and (iv)
            blood transfusion which will assist current efforts to
            improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products
            by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood
            transfusion centers by introducing safer and more up to date
            technology and by actively promoting the recruitment of new donors.
