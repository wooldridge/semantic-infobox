&#13;
Objectives &amp; Description:   The objective of the proposed Emergency Road Rehabilitation&#13;
                            Project is to improve the condition of road assets by rehabilitating&#13;
                            highly damaged segments of the country's highway and rural road&#13;
                            networks, reestablishing critical river crossings, and restoring the&#13;
                            capacity to manage and maintain road assets.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits and Risks:         Benefits: The project will benefit road users throughout Iraq, as well&#13;
                            as promote the country's economic integration, facilitate trade, and&#13;
                            support reconstruction efforts across all sectors. Although the project&#13;
                             i s essentially an emergency operation, substantial benefits would be&#13;
                            derived from attempts to address medium- to long-term policy and&#13;
                             institutional issues, and by developing a vision for how road sector&#13;
                            assets should be managed and developed beyond the emergency&#13;
                            stage. The civil works and subsequent maintenance activities will&#13;
                            also provide local employment opportunities.&#13;
                            Risks: The project will be implemented in a high risk environment.&#13;
                            The unstable security situation and limited capacity o f the private&#13;
                            sector and government counterparts pose the greatest risks.&#13;
                            Contractors and consultants working in Iraq will face high risks, and&#13;
                            special arrangements may be needed to ensure a reasonable level of&#13;
                            protection. A presentation o f risks, including proposed measures to&#13;
                            mitigate their impact, is provided in Paragraph32.&#13;

                                           BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Country Background&#13;
&#13;
1.        Large oil reserves and abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status o f a&#13;
middle-income country in the 1970s. Years o f conflict, misdirected resources, and the effects o f Iraq's&#13;
centralized command economy stifled economic growth and development, prevented the proper&#13;
maintenance o f basic infrastructure, and negatively impacted social services. More recent conflicts have&#13;
resulted in looting and sabotage with direct damage to buildings, pipelines, and transportation and&#13;
communication links. As a result, Iraq's human development indicators are now among the lowest inthe&#13;
region. According to 2004 estimates, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at US$942 per person, and at&#13;
least two million Iraqis were unemployed, a figure that represents about 30 percent o f the overall&#13;
workforce. Access to basic services, such as power, water, affordable transportation, healthcare, and&#13;
education, are inadequate; and income inequality, which i s growing, may exacerbate social tensions. On-&#13;
going insecurity further increases poverty and vulnerability, while poor or unreliable access to work and&#13;
employment opportunities, markets and social services i s causing temporary hardship for a large segment&#13;
of the population, and could lead to increased long-term, chronic poverty.&#13;
&#13;
International Response&#13;
&#13;
2.        At the request of the international community, the World Bank and the United Nations&#13;
Development Group produced a joint United NationsiWorld Bank Iraq Needs Assessment in October&#13;
2003. The assessment estimated total reconstruction needs at US$35.8 billion, excluding oil and security&#13;
 expenditures. The report served as the basis for an international Donor Conference inMadrid in October&#13;
 2003.    Of the nearly USfi32.0       billion pledged by donors at the conference, most was earmarked for&#13;
bilateral distribution. The United States (US) was the single largest contributor to Iraq's reconstruction&#13;
 effort, and most o f the USS18.6 billion approved by the US Congress was for infrastructure.' Japan, the&#13;
 second largest contributor, allocated about US$5.0 billion, largely for electricity, and water supply and&#13;
 sanitation. Other major pledges came from the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, Spain&#13;
 and Canada, which together pledgedabout U S 3 . 0 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 International Reconstruction FundFacility for Iraq (TTCFFI) -- to provide coordinated donor financing for&#13;
 3.        The international community agreed in late 2003 to establish a multi-donor a t fimd -- the&#13;
&#13;
 priority investments identified       in the Needs Assessment, while reducing transaction costs for Iraqi&#13;
 authorities. The IRFFI encompasses two trust finds with a common governance structure: the World&#13;
 Bank-administered IraqTrust Fund(ITF) and the UnitedNations Development Group Trust Fund, which&#13;
 i s administered by the UnitedNations Development Programme. As o f the end o f January 2006, donors&#13;
 had deposited about USs1.4 billion in IRFFI, including about US$457 million to the World Bank ITF.&#13;
 ITF funds have been committed to ten projects, one o f which is completed, to build capacity, improve&#13;
 education and healthcare, rehabilitate water infrastructure, and facilitate private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
 Road Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
 4.        Once regarded as having one o f the Middle East's most comprehensive transportation systems,&#13;
 Iraq's transport infrastructure has suffered from more than two decades of neglect and underinvestment.&#13;
 Between 1980 and 2003, regional conflicts, the utilization o f public resources to support military&#13;
 initiatives, an extended period o f economic sanctions, and deferred maintenance contributed to a&#13;
 pernicious and general decline in the quality o f transport facilities and services, and to huge losses in&#13;
 rolling stock. With the onset o f the 2003 military intervention, many assets were damaged due to heavy&#13;
 bombing, while the looting that followed stripped ministries and transport facilities o f equipment,&#13;
 machinery, furniture and supplies. In addition to these challenges, Iraq must transition from a centrally-&#13;
 planned, command economy to one that is market based. As a result, the country faces enormous&#13;
  '  The allocations included: (i)electricity - USS5.56 billion; (ii)public works and water - USS4.33 billion; (iii)&#13;
     security, justice, and safety - USS4.56 billion; (iv) buildings, housing, and health sectors - USS1.33 billion; (v) oil&#13;
     infrastructure - USSl.89 billion; and (vi) transportation and telecommunications    - US$O.jO   billion.&#13;
                                                              - 1-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
challenges in reconstructing its transportation networks and facilities, as well as in re-establishing key&#13;
transport services.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Iraq's 42,000 hlorneter road network is classified as national highways, primary roads, secondary&#13;
roads, village access roads and special purpose roads (military and border roads). Although some 85&#13;
percent o f the network i s paved, damages sustained during numerous conflicts, inadequate repairs, and&#13;
deferred maintenance have rendered much o f the network to fair or poor condition`. As a result, a large&#13;
share o f roads i s in immediate need o f rehabilitation. There has also been a pronounced deterioration of&#13;
village access roads, which has diminished access to markets and social services in many rural areas. The&#13;
topography o f Iraq, with two inajor river systems along which most cities are located, makes bridges a&#13;
vital part o f the road network. As a result o f the first Gulf War and subsequent conflicts, many o f the&#13;
country's more than 1,000 bridges suffered damage, and several key river crossings were never provided&#13;
withreplacementbridges. Instead, temporaiy structures (floatingbridges)were put inplace.&#13;
&#13;
6.       With the exception o f municipal roads, responsibility for constructing and maintaining the&#13;
classified road network lies with the Ministry o f Construction and Housing (MOCH), and specifically, the&#13;
State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB). However, policy formulation and planning activities&#13;
for the road sector are the responsibilities of the Ministry o f Planning and Development Cooperation&#13;
(MOPDC). Local roads in cities and towns under the jurisdiction o fmunicipalities are the responsibility&#13;
of the Ministry o f Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW). In the northern Governorates, there i s a&#13;
regional Ministry o f Construction and Housing and a General Directorate o f Roads (GDRB) that mirror&#13;
the structure of, and have similar responsibilities as, the M O C H and the SCRB. This arrangement has&#13;
been inplace for more than ten years.&#13;
&#13;
7.       The consulting industry in Iraq encompasses four types o f public and private institutions: (a)&#13;
engineering offices in ministries; (b) consulting services offered by universities; (c) goveniment-owned&#13;
consulting corporations; and (d) privately owned consulting firms. Inthe 1970s, there were a number o f&#13;
private consulting firms in all fields o f engineering, but due to a change in policy requiring ministries to&#13;
rely on in-house expertise and parastatal consulting corporations, the quality and capacity o f the private&#13;
sector deteriorated to the extent that it no longer offers services in the transport sector. This i s partly&#13;
because the SCRB and the GDRB have developed and relied on its in-house capacity3 to design most of&#13;
the country's roads and bridges, and because the universities have been encouraged to cany out the&#13;
technically more difficult studies. The main parastatal consulting corporation i s the National Center for&#13;
Engineering Consultancy (NCEC), which has some capabilities in the area o froad and bridge design.Few&#13;
of these institutions .have experience in undertalung independent construction supervision as the&#13;
"Engineer" according to the Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs Conseils (FDIC) conditions o f&#13;
contract. The Iraqi EngineeringUnion classifies engineering firms and licenses professional engineers.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The road construction industry in Iraq can be classified in two main categories: (a) private&#13;
entrepreneurs; and (b) state-owned construction corporations. The capacity and capabilities o f the private&#13;
sector has been depleted due to years o f war and increased reliance on parastatal corporations. Presently,&#13;
it can only offer sub-contracting services to larger foreign companies. The Iraqi Contractors' Federation&#13;
has ten classifications for contractors, but only publicly owned coi-porations are in the top categoiy.&#13;
However, several have the experience and equipment to carry out works for roads, bridges, buildings and&#13;
other infrastructpe, and the local consulting and contracting industries have been instrumental in past&#13;
reconstruction efforts, particularly after the 1991 Gulf War. One can also expect that private sector&#13;
contractors, with some facilitation and opporhmities for road and bridge works, could expand their&#13;
capabilities and compete with the publicly owned corporations, as well as foreign contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Fifty percentof national highways, 70 percent o fprimary roads, 80 percent of secondaryroads, and90 percent of&#13;
   village access roads are consideredto be in fair or poor condition. Overall, it is estimatedthat just six percent of&#13;
   the roadnetwork is ingood condition, 56 percent is infair condition, and 32 percent is inpoor condition.&#13;
   The SCRB and the GDRB have local offices in each of the 18 Governorates, and used to have a well-developed&#13;
   collectioii of national laboratories for testing of materials and road works.&#13;
                                                            - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Key issues in the Road Sector&#13;
&#13;
 9.        Loss ofKey Rond Assets. In a large country such as Iraq, with a total land area o f about 432,000&#13;
 square Jan, and around 27 million inhabitants, roads play a central role in the movement o f people and&#13;
 goods. Estimates indicate that roads accommodate 70 percent o f all land transport in Iraq. Most o f the&#13;
. country's nearly 42,000 km` road network was developed in the 1970s and 198Os, and little, if any, new&#13;
 construction has taken place since. Although some S5 percent o f the network i s paved, maintenance has&#13;
 consistently been deferred. As a result, large backlogs of maintenance have accumulated over the years,&#13;
 pavementshave failed inmany areas, and a significant portion of the network i s in need o f rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
  10.      Deterioration of     Village Access Roads.            Inadequate repairs and maintenance have also&#13;
  contributed to a pronounced deterioration in village roads, which have been neglected to the extent that&#13;
  reconstruction, rather then rehabilitation, i s needed along much of the rural road network. This has&#13;
  diminishedaccess to markets and social services inmany rural areas, and contributes to isolation.&#13;
&#13;
  11.      Bridges Critical to Iraq's Road Network. The topography of Iraq, with two major river systems&#13;
  along which most cities are located, make bridges a vital part o f the road network, which includes more&#13;
  than 1,000 bridges. As a result o f the first Gulf War, many of the country's bridges' were damaged, and&#13;
  several key connections were never replaced. Instead, temporary structures (floating bridges)6were put in&#13;
  place. Because of the sanctions, iiiost rehabilitative works were stopped and only limited maintenance&#13;
  activities undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
  12.      Absence of Quality Control hfeaszires. Another key loss was the Government road laboratories,&#13;
  which were decimated by looting.            Not only were equipment and supplies stolen, but most o f the&#13;
  institutional capacity at the country's central and regional facilities was also negatively impacted. These&#13;
  laboratories played an important role in controlling the quality o f road constniction, and need to be&#13;
  reconstituted on an urgent basis.&#13;
&#13;
  13.      Weakened Capacitql to ibfanage Road Network. Historically, capacity to manage the country's&#13;
  network o f roads has been strong and adequate.                 However, reliance on outdated procedures and&#13;
  equipment has eroded skills and abilities, which are inneed o f updating and strengthening. The process&#13;
  of managing roads would also benefit froni re-engineering, including adopting modern techniques and&#13;
  delegating appropriate levels o f administrative and managerial autonomy to the provincial offices.&#13;
&#13;
  14.      Rapidly Expanding VehicleFleet. In 1970, there were just 122,200 vehicles registered in Iraq.&#13;
  By 1980, the number had grown to 463,000, and reached one million in 1989. Under the economic&#13;
  sanctions o f the 199Os, growth slowed sharply, however, various sources indicate that more than 500,000'&#13;
  used-vehicles were imported into Iraq between mid-2003 and early 2004. This represents an increase in&#13;
  excess of 40 percent in Iraq's vehicle fleet inless than a year. Due to extensive reliance on land transport&#13;
  and demand that has been suppressed for more than a decade, the size of Iraq's vehicle fleet i s expected to&#13;
  continue increasing rapidly, which will cause traffic to grow significantly. Already, several key arteries&#13;
  linkingmajor urban centers are experiencinghightraffic volumes' andhave reached saturation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There are approximately 1,084 km of national highways, 11,000 km o f primary roads, 15,200 km of secondary&#13;
    roads, 3,704 km of village access roads, and 11,000 km o f army roads along Iraq's borders (which account for&#13;
  ' more than 25 percent of the total network).&#13;
    There are about 1,156 bridges throughout Iraq, 148 main and 1,008 secondary bridges.&#13;
&#13;
  ' There are 69 pontoonbridges located throughout the central and southernparts o f Iraq.&#13;
    Several sources indicate that the figure is closer to 800,000 used-vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
    Recent traffic counts are not available, except for the Esbil- L41tunKopri Road.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                      BANKRESPONSE       AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
15.       Inresponseto a foniial request from theInterimGovernment inDecember2004,theWorldBank&#13;
agreed to extend Iraq up to US$500 million in International Development Association (IDA) Credits&#13;
between FY2005 and FY2007. This comes in addition to the funds available in the ITF. It i s expected&#13;
that the Bank Group's work program will represent a range o f potential IDA interventions based on three&#13;
objectives, which are to:&#13;
          (a) build institutional capacity, and especially to establish mechanisms o f transparency and&#13;
              accountability urgently needed for implementing the large amount o f external funding needed&#13;
              for Iraq's reconstruction;&#13;
          (b) prepare and implement, to the extent possible under the circumstances, emergency operations&#13;
              to generate employment and kick-start economic activity, and restore essential infrastructure&#13;
              and services; and&#13;
          (c) lay the groundwork for Iraq's medium-term reconstruction and development program, and&#13;
              begin assisting inthe transition from a centrally-planned economy to one that i s market-based&#13;
              through the provision o f policy advice and analytical work.&#13;
&#13;
16.       To date, the Bank has approved ten ITF-financed projects, one o f which has closed. Of the nine&#13;
projects currently under implementation, eight are being implemented by Iraqi authorities. This i s a&#13;
considerable achievement, considering that Iraq lacks recent experience with international donor&#13;
procedures and has not borrowed from the Bank for 25 years.g The Bank's implementing arrangements&#13;
seek to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional capacity, which contrasts with the&#13;
implementation arrangements usedby some donors.&#13;
&#13;
 17.      The Bank also prepared a Second InterimStrategy for Iraq (discussed by the Executive Directors&#13;
on September 15, 2005), which seeks to guide the development of efficient, transparent and accountable&#13;
institutions as a means of supporting economic activity. The Strategy stresses the need to restore basic&#13;
service delivery, and particularly to address transport bottlenecks that impede reconstruction and public&#13;
access to services and markets. Within this context, the Government has asked the Bank's financial&#13;
support for an Emergency Road RehabilitationProject ( E m ) .&#13;
&#13;
 18.-     As indicated in the Bank's Second Interim Strategy Note for Iraq, Government priorities for the&#13;
US$500 million IDA allocation are for education, electricity, transport and water supply. As per the&#13;
Government's declaration that 17 percent o f donor support be earmarked for projects determined by the&#13;
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), the KRG explicitly requested that its share of the US$500&#13;
million IDA allocation be concentrated in roads (US$45 million) and power (US$40 million).                 In&#13;
November 2005, Executive Directors approved the first IDA Credit to Iraq UStSlOO million for a Third&#13;
                                                                                 -&#13;
Emergency Education Project. The proposed ERRP would be the second IDA Credit for Iraq. In June&#13;
2006, the new fiill-term Government o f Iraqreconfirmed its support for the proposed ERRP.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
 19.      Inresponse to the tremendous need to rehabilitate and restore basic infrastructure facilities and&#13;
services throughout Iraq, initial donor support was primarily directed to finance priority investments in&#13;
the power and water sectors, as well as to improve key social services. While road sector assets have not&#13;
received the same level of attention, their condition has reached a critical stage where their rehabilitation,&#13;
essential to the reconstruction effort, can no longer be deferred. The preservation o f road assets was&#13;
identified  by the Government as a priority, and support for a project to rehabilitate key segments of the&#13;
network and prepare overall road rehabilitation and rural access programs was expressly requested to be&#13;
part o f the first IDA allocation. The civil works and subsequent maintenance activities associated with&#13;
the ERRPwill also create some muchneeded local employment opportunities inthe near-terni.&#13;
&#13;
-&#13;
  Iraq received six JBRD Loans between 1950 and 1973, the last o f which closed in 1979.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.      The rationale for significant IDA involvement at this stage in rehabilitating Iraq's highway and&#13;
rural road infrastructure is its comparative advantage in addressing immediate needs, while at the same&#13;
time strengthening the policy and institutional framework for the sector's long-term sustainability. In&#13;
addition, there i s a significant financing gap in the sector in the short- to medium-term (US$2.25 billion&#13;
for the transport sector, of which USO.575 billion i s earmarked for roads and bridges)." As noted above,&#13;
large donors, such as the United States and Japan, are channeling most o f their suipport to other&#13;
infrastructure investments, with little funding for the road sector, and there i s need for substantial&#13;
additional financing to address road transport bottlenecks and other inefficiencies in the sector. The Bank&#13;
has the resources, experience, and expertise to support new road sector operations, and to complement&#13;
ongoing investments through the regular Iraqi budget.&#13;
&#13;
21.       The Bank i s in a position to share international experience and best practices based on its&#13;
considerable involvement in implementing transport infrastructure projects and reestablishing capacity in&#13;
conflict-affected areas. The Bank's reconstruction efforts put a premium on early, but selective&#13;
engagement, flexibility in design and implementation, capacity restoration, coordination with donors and&#13;
other partners, and close monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
22.       Other factors are:&#13;
             Once operational, Bank-financed projects often attract resources from other. development&#13;
             agencies and Government budgets, and assist inmore efficient utilization and coordination of&#13;
             investments and technical assistance in the sector. In this context, an early output o f the&#13;
             ERRP will be to identify a road rehabilitationprogram, which can be used to seek additional&#13;
             fLinding from other donors. In this respect, the Islamic Development Bank has expressed&#13;
             interest inproviding parallel financing to rehabilitate and widen the road from Altun Kopri to&#13;
             Kirkuk,which would conipleinent Component B.l ofthe E W .&#13;
             Bank financing, in contrast to the financing offered by many other donors, would be&#13;
             implemented by Iraq through the country's own ministries and agencies, which would better&#13;
             ensure Iraqi ownership and build institutional capacity, both o f which are crucial for the&#13;
             country's longer-term development. In this case, the strategy would be to build on existing&#13;
             capacity by establishing dedicated project management teams.          The project management&#13;
             teams are viewed as necessaiy because o f the large financing requirements, and as a means to&#13;
             buildcapacity.&#13;
             The Bank will provide financing to the Government for rehabilitative works combined with&#13;
             policy advice, institutional development and reform assistance, all o f which are essential for&#13;
             the long-term sustainability o f investments inthe road sector. Focus should also be placed on&#13;
             increasing harmonization with other donors and, to the extent possible, laying the foundation&#13;
             for longer-term engagement.&#13;
             With the exception o f the Erbil to Altun Kopri Road sub-project, which will attract&#13;
             international contractors, components have been defined in an effort to allow local and&#13;
             regional contractors to fully participate in implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Applying Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
23.       The quality of sectoral analyses underpinning projects i s important. For emergency operations,&#13;
hasty needs assessments are often the only basis on which early Bank interventions arejustified. Inmany&#13;
instances, these operations then suffer subsequent delays, must be restructured, or have their&#13;
implementation periods extended to achieve a reasonable set o f objectives. For the proposed ERRP, an&#13;
international consulting finn with a local counterpart carried out a detailed assessment o f the Iraqi&#13;
transport sector over a one-year period, and this has served as a reliable instrument for structuring the&#13;
ERRP.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
24.      Early assessnients persistently overstate the absorptive capacity o f post-conflict administrations.&#13;
The inclination is to give benefit o f the doubt under such circumstances. Research indicates," however,&#13;
that during the first few post-conflict years, absorptive capacity for aid is n o greater than normal, and&#13;
typically well below expectations. The project will try to address this by keeping the structure simple,&#13;
and involving consultants to assist ministries at all stages o f the project cycle (design, tender documents,&#13;
bidding-award, and construction supervision).&#13;
&#13;
25.      Needs assessments sometimes lack ownership by new administrations. When this is the case,&#13;
they should be revalidated to ensure priorities are aligned with emerging changes o n the ground, and&#13;
associated costs revisited to ensure accuracy.        Each o f the investments proposed in the ERRP were&#13;
identified by counterparts, and subjected to the same selection criteria to help ensure quick and effective&#13;
implementation. This has provided a better foundation for agreement o n priorities and possible project&#13;
components.&#13;
&#13;
26.      The effectiveness of aid depends o n sector policies and institutions, the better the policies the&#13;
larger the potential for growth.       Project designs should reflect this and integrate policy advice and&#13;
institutional assessments (and training), something which is reflected in the proposed project. The E W&#13;
has sought to strike a carefLil balance between works and results o n the ground, and essential policy&#13;
advice that will add value without generating resistance from beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Donors often bypass weak government capacity by contracting out services directly and&#13;
providing assistance in kind. Bypassing local institutions is usually more expensive and can build&#13;
resentment when aid money allocated to the country is used to fund firms from donor countries,&#13;
international agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly when they have not been&#13;
selected through competitive or transparent processes. The strategy for the ERRP will be to begin&#13;
building capacity early on during implementation, while addressing short-term needs through temporary&#13;
an-angements. This approach should enable a quick start to reconstruction activities and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Recent experience in Iraq has highlighted the importance of professional due diligence o n&#13;
projects prepared by Iraqi professionals. Moreover, considering the rise incost o f doing business inIraq,&#13;
and the need for more accurate estimations of total project costs and realistic price contingencies,&#13;
comprehensive feasibility studies during project preparation are highly advantageous. To prevent delays&#13;
in implementation, consideration should be given to sequencing straight forward sub-projects for early&#13;
implementation, and allowing additional time to prepare more complex operations.              The ERRP will&#13;
einploy this approach by initially utilizing SCRB designs for simple road improvements, and bringingin&#13;
the services of engineering firms to prepare the ERRP's more challenging investments shortly after&#13;
project launch.&#13;
&#13;
29.      Experience has also shown that it is difficult to predict project costs in areas where prices are&#13;
affected by security risks, difficult mobilization, mine clearance actions, and supply/demand imbalances.&#13;
This is especially true for materials that are subsidized (for instance, fuel and bitumen), or when supplies&#13;
are subject to disruption. A flexible design i s needed that allows for a project's scope to be reviewed as&#13;
part of an Early Implementation Assessment (after about 12 months), when contracting rates and other&#13;
costs and implementation difficulties are better lmown.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Focusing on implementation arrangements during preparation i s important. The Project&#13;
Management Team (PMT) model utilized in previous projects has proven to be quite effective, and&#13;
apparently, other donors are considering using the same approach. Under this model, staff i s seconded,&#13;
on a full-time and/or part-time basis, from various departments within the implementing ministry and its&#13;
agencies to work in dedicated PMTs, which receive support from outside consultants.             In this regard,&#13;
high-level support for the concept is critical, as is the early appointment o f key members of the PMT.&#13;
K e y members o f the PMTs have been involved throughout the E m ' s preparation, including appraisal&#13;
and negotiations. They have also received training inthe Bank's fiduciary requirements.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3 1      An important lesson learned through implementationo fprojects supported by the IraqTrust Fund&#13;
   ~&#13;
&#13;
(ITF) is that fiduciary matters deserve special attention. Counterparts are unfamiliar with the Bank's&#13;
requirements, and have only limited capacity to procure, disburse and account for project-related&#13;
expenditures according to Bank procedures. Several ITF-financed grants have experienced significant&#13;
delays due to slow preparation and processing o f procurement documents, which usually require several&#13;
iterations, lengthy processes within ministries to approve bidding documents and sign contracts, and&#13;
delays in malung payments and disbursements, which has led to work stoppages. For more effective&#13;
implementation, continual and proactive support should be provided to implementing agencies to ensure&#13;
compliance with the Bank's fiduciary requirements, procurement plans should not be overly ambitious,&#13;
and assistance provided to ensure proper preparation o f documentation for direct payments.&#13;
&#13;

bottlenecks.&#13;

&#13;
33.      The ERRP has been flexibly designed to permit more rapid responses to changing circumstances&#13;
o n the ground, and to allow adjustments to the relative size and scope o f components as implementation&#13;
progresses.&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
34.      The main objective of the proposed ERRP i s to improve the condition o f road assets by&#13;
rehabilitating highly damaged segments o f the country's highway and rural road networks, reestablishing&#13;
critical river crossings, and restoring the capacity to manage and maintain road sssets. This would&#13;
contribute to the country's economic and social recovery.&#13;
&#13;
35.      The removal o f key road network bottlenecks would promote economic integration by facilitating&#13;
trade and reconstruction efforts in all sectors. It would also help to restore normal and safe traffic&#13;
operations on critical road corridors. In addition, the proposed civil works on highways and village&#13;
access roads.would provide local employinent opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
36.      The project i s considered an emergency operation because it seeks to restore road sector assets&#13;
and improve their productive levels of service. In turn, this will support more efficient movement o f&#13;
goods, increasemobility, and expand access to markets and social services, which are critical to economic&#13;
recovery.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Given the project's emergency nature, outputs, rather than outcomes, will be used to measure&#13;
success in achieving objectives. These outputs will include the timely rehabilitation o f critical roads&#13;
segments and bridges, the development o f road rehabilitation programs, and the provision o f essential&#13;
road management tools.&#13;
&#13;
38.      The proposed ERFV i s fi-illy consistent with the World Bank's Second Interim Strategy Note for&#13;
Iraq, which emphasizes the need for rapid rehabilitation o f critical infrastnicture services and institutional&#13;
capacity buildingas prerequisites for recovery and long-term development.&#13;
&#13;

central and southern Governorates; and (ii)Part B (US$45.0 million), which focuses on sub-projects in&#13;
Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaimanyah Governorates. Parts A and B wil! be implemented independently by the&#13;
State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB) in Baghdad, and the General Directorate for Roads and&#13;
Bridges (GDRB) o f the Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil, respectively. There will be only one&#13;

40.     Part A o f the proposed ERRP, which covers the 15 central and southern Governorates, will have&#13;
five components:&#13;
            A.I: Highway Rehnbilitatioii FVorks. This component consists of rehabilitating priority&#13;
            sections of the highway network (about 300 hi).The identified road sections, which are on&#13;
            highways connecting main cities, are in very bad condition and cause major travel delays.&#13;
            The works consist mainly o f pavement repairs and strengthening, but also shoulder&#13;
            stabilization, road fLimishings, including lane marlung and traffic signs, new guardrails, and&#13;
            drainage repairs.&#13;
            A.2: Village Access Roads. This component will upgrade about 150 km o f village access&#13;
            roads in several locations. It consists of reconstruction and rehabilitation o f numerous access&#13;
            roads between isolated villages in various Governorates. Improvements to these rural access&#13;
            roads will facilitate travel and commerce by reducing travel time and costs, andby facilitating&#13;
            the movement o f agricultural products from farms to markets.&#13;
            A.3: Bridge Replacemeiits. This component will provide a limited number o f critical river&#13;
            crossings (about three) by replacing their old decaying floating bridges with safer permanent&#13;
            concrete bridges. The amount available under this sub-component may limit to three the&#13;
            number o f bridges that can be constructed.&#13;
            .4.4:   Road Asset Ilfanagenient and Road Rehabilitation Programming. This initiative will&#13;
             develop road maintenance and management strategies and establish a road asset management&#13;
             system.      It will include support for preparing a multi-year national road rehabilitation&#13;
            program and a village access program, along with their associated financing plans, as well as&#13;
             capacity buildingmeasures.&#13;
            A.5: Project hfanagernent. Financial s~ipportwill be provided to manage project activities and&#13;
            provide on the job training in project management. The Credit will finance the costs of&#13;
             setting ~ i apProject Management Team within the State Commission for Roads and Bridges&#13;
             in Baghdad, including necessary office equipment, materials, technical assistance, training,&#13;
             and other related costs.&#13;
 Part B Project Components for the Three Northern Governorates&#13;
        -&#13;
41.     Part B o f the ERR' will be implemented inthe Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaimanyah Governorates and&#13;
have four components:&#13;
            B.l: Rehabilitation and Upgrading of the 38.5'ki?zlong Erbil - Altiin Kopri Road. This&#13;
             component will rehabilitate and widen the main road from Erbil to Altun Kopri (about 38.5&#13;
             hi)intheKurdistanRegion, whichisapriorityfortheRegionalGovernment. Thesection&#13;
             from Erbil to Altun Kopri i s part o f the Erbil to Baghdad highway that serves as a critical&#13;
            trade corridorI2 for the regional economy. Due to severe deterioration of the pavement and&#13;
             frequent overtaking, there are about twelve serious road crashes daily, resulting in numerous&#13;
             injuries and fatalities every year.&#13;
            B.2: VillageAccess Roads. The Project will rehabilitate up to 75 kmo frural roads connecting&#13;
            remote villages in the Kurdistan Region. Around 25 km o f roads in each o f the KRG&#13;
             Governorates will be upgraded.&#13;
            B.3: Road Asset hfanagemertt and Road Rehabilitation Propainning. This initiative will&#13;
            develop road rehabilitation and maintenance management strategies and establish a fully&#13;
             functioning road asset management system for the northern Governorates. This will entail&#13;
            preparing a highway rehabilitation and maintenance program, as well as a village access road&#13;
            program.&#13;

               B.4: Project khngeiitent. Financial support will be provided to manage project activities and&#13;
               provide o n the j o b training in project management.            The Credit will finance the costs o f&#13;
               setting LIP a Project Management Team within the General Directorate o f Roads and Bridges&#13;
               in Erbil, including necessaiy office equipment, materials, technical assistance, training, and&#13;
               other related costs.&#13;
&#13;
42.         The roads and bridges to be rehabilitated at the beginning of the project (for Parts A and B) were&#13;
selected based on: (a) for main roads, high traffic volumes and levels o f deterioration; (b) for village&#13;
roads, impacts o n rural accessibility; and (c) for bridges, linkages with main roads that will facilitate&#13;
commerce and traffic flows.            The selection o f the other main roads and village access roads to be&#13;
rehabilitated under the project will be subjected to the same criteria used for the project's first-year works&#13;
(i.e. traffic and level of deterioration for the main roads, and impact o f rural accessibility for the village&#13;
access roads).       Based o n the same criteria, substitution o f roads will be considered in response to&#13;
unforeseen circumstances (e.g., security conditions).&#13;
&#13;
Project Cost and Financing&#13;
&#13;
43.         The estimated cost of the E W i s SDR 93.2 million (US135.0 million equivalent). Of this&#13;
amount, approximately SDR 62.1 million (US$90.0 million equivalent) will go to the SCRB in Baghdad&#13;
to implement Part A, and around SDR 31.1 million (US$45 .O million equivalent) will go to the General&#13;
Directorate for Roads and Bridges in the Kurdistan Region t o implement Part B. The resources (IDA&#13;
Credit) will be providedto Iraqo n blend terms as provided for in the 2003 Board paper o n IDA lending to&#13;

                    INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
 Project Management Structure&#13;
&#13;
47.       The Bank's strategy for Iraq seeks to ensure local ownershi? and strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
by financing operations that are implementedby Iraqi instihitions. Based on experience gained through&#13;
the ITF-financed projects, the proposed management structure for the EIiRP will be similar. It adopts the&#13;
PMTmodel, whereby staff fromvarious departments withinthe implementing ministry and its agencies is&#13;
seconded on a full-time andor on a part-time basis to work in the PMT, with support from outside&#13;
consultants.&#13;
&#13;
48.       There will be two PMTs, one at the State Commission for Roads and Bridges within the Ministry&#13;
of Construction and Housing in Baghdad, and the other at the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges&#13;
inthe KRG. The PMT at the SCRB will be responsible for implementing sub-projects inthe central and&#13;
southern Governorates, while the PMT at the GDFS will implement sub-projects in the KRG&#13;
Governorates. The Ministry o f Planning and Development Cooperation will act as the coordinating&#13;
agency responsible for budgeting, counterpart funding and co-financing from bilateral donors or the ITF.&#13;
Appropriate mechanisms for donor coordination will be established through regular meetings among&#13;
donors supporting the road sector. These meetings will be coordinated by the MOPDC.&#13;
&#13;
49.       During preparation, the Bank Team worked through the implementing agencies to understand&#13;
other donors' plans for the transport sector, including the United States and Japan, in an effort to avoid&#13;
unnecessary overlap at the subproject level.&#13;
&#13;
50.      The two PMTs will be responsibIe for managing all project zctivities under their respective&#13;
jurisdictions, including contract management, supervision and quality control, reporting, and&#13;
administration o f project funds.''       Malung payments to suppliers, consultants and contractors, and&#13;
ensuring that funds are disbursed according to Bank guidelines and procedures will also be the&#13;
responsibility o f the PMTs. The PMT model will provide the skills needed for effective project&#13;

&#13;
51.      The structure and staffing o f the PMTs were definedand agreed with the relevant line ministries.&#13;
In addition to Project Managers, PMT staff will include senior technical staff (highway engineers),&#13;
procurement specialists, financial management specialists, accountants, environmental focal points, and&#13;
administrative support staff.      Support will be extended to both PMTs to implement their respective&#13;
components (including procurement, financial management and safeguard activities), and international&#13;
experts will assist them inthe review o f technical designs and quality enhancement activities.&#13;
&#13;
52.      There will be one Financing Agreement between the IDA and the Republic of Iraq (Recipient).&#13;
In the documentation for the Credit, fidl implementation responsibility, including procurement and&#13;
financial management, will be assigned to the SCRB for the fifteen central and southern Governorates,&#13;
and the GDRB for the three KRG Governorates.&#13;

  54.      Civil works for the first year's program will be based on SCRB designs. Engineering and design&#13;
  work for subsequent works will build on SCRB experience to develop more up-to-date technical&#13;
  specifications with the support of qualified engineering firms.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
  Procurement&#13;
&#13;
  56.      Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines:&#13;
  Procurement iaides IBRD Loans arid IDA Credits, dated May 2004, Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
  Enzployment of Coiisultnnts by World Bank Borrowers, dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in&#13;
  the-Financing Agreement. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the procurement methods or&#13;
  consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements,&#13;
  and time frame are reflected inthe ProcurementPlan (PP). The PP will be updated, as required, to reflect&#13;
  the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.                   A General&#13;
  Procurement Notice was published in the United Nations Development Business (UN Development&#13;
  Biisiness on-line) on February 1, 2006, and will be revised after the project i s approved by the Bank's&#13;
  Board o f Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
 Assessment of the iinpleinenting agency s capacity to implement procurement&#13;
  57.      An Operational Procurement Review for Iraq was completed in June 2005 and sent to the&#13;
  Government. The review highlightedthe need to clarify the legal framework for public procurement and&#13;
  enact appropriate legislation.      To ensure that Bank-financed projects are implemented under clearly&#13;
  specified procurement procedures, the Bank developed (in August 2005) a Master Implementation&#13;
  Manuel (MIM)for projects in Iraq. The MIMprovided guidance on fiduciary matters and served as the&#13;
 basis for developing the E m ' s Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
  58.      The SCRB has offices in all fifteen central and southern Governorates, while the GDRB has&#13;
  offices in the three northern Goveinorates o f Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaimanyah. The SCFU3 and the GDRB&#13;
  are responsible for iniplementingprojects funded by the national budget, as well as other sizable donor-&#13;
  financed infrastructure projects involving the rehabilitation o f existing, and construction o f new, roads&#13;
 and bridges throughout the country. There i s no centralized procurement department, and the SCRB and&#13;
 the GDRB provide administrative, h a n c i a l and technical support to each Governorate, and carry out&#13;
 procurement through specialized units.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       - 1 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59.     Procurement activities will be carried out by two PMTs." The SCRB-PMT in Baghdad will&#13;
focus on sub-projects in the 15 central and southern Governorates, while the GDRB-PMT in Erbil will&#13;
focus on sub-projects in the three Governorates o f the KRG. Although the SCRB and the GDRB have&#13;
sufficient implementation capacity, the ERRP would be their first experience with World Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines andprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Proczirenient risk assessineiit&#13;
60.      The procurement risk i s rated high. The risks associated with procurement were identified and&#13;
documented the MOCH's procurement capacity assessment, and include: (i)               inadequate procurement laws&#13;
and regulations, and of modem documentation practices; (ii)           entrenched procurement practices that will&#13;
take time to modernize; (iii)limited experience in the use o f Bank procurement guidelines and&#13;
international procurement practices; (iv) limited access o f international Bank procurement staff to&#13;
supervise the project in the field; (v) delays in implementing the procurement plan due to lack o f&#13;
experience in procurement planning and the volatile security conditions inIraq; (vi) increase in prices o f&#13;
raw construction materials due to high demand and unavailability o f these materials, which may impact&#13;
subproject completion due to contractors' unwillingness to continue work based on old contract prices;&#13;
(vii) possible looting of construction sites; and (viii) delays inbid submission and/or implementation due&#13;
to poor security conditions in some areas in Iraq. Measures to mitigate these risks are summarized in&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
61.      Implementation and procurement arrangements have also been established to help mitigate the&#13;
risks of fraud and corruption. These include, but are not limited to: (i)         publishing and regularly updating&#13;
procurement plans to ensure a level playing field for interested firms; (ii)staffing the PMTs with&#13;
procurement and financial management specialists; (iii)         subjecting all contract awards to the Bank`s prior&#13;
review; (iv) ensuring that only pre-qualified contractors are invited to submit bids for major works; (v)&#13;
applying post-qualification criteria for small and medium works contracts to avoid dealing with&#13;
unqualified contractors and/or intermediaries; (vi) involving an international qualified third party firm to&#13;
support the PMTs and assist inprocurement activities; and (vii) requiringall road and bridge works to be&#13;
supervised by qualified construction supervision firms. The thirdparty consultants (support to the PMTs&#13;
and construction supervision firms) will assist the PMTs to procure works, goods and services, review&#13;
project documentation, ensure that appropriate fiduciary arrangements are in place, and conduct site&#13;
visits.   The consulting fimis will also provide on-the-job training regarding World Bank procurement&#13;
procedures, the preparation of bidding documents, and evaluation of bids and proposals.                       Close&#13;
monitoring and advice from the Bank's local procurement consultants inIraqwill also be available to the&#13;
PMTs. Finally, the number G f contracts has been minimized to simplify procurement, and all payments&#13;
above US$20,000 will be made through direct payment uponreceipt o f required documentation.&#13;
&#13;
Prociirenient Plan&#13;
62.      A procurement plan, which provides information on procurement packages and methods, is&#13;
available in Annex 6, Appendix 6.2.            The initial Procurement Plan, dated February 16, 2006, was&#13;
finalized and agreed during negotiations. It will be available at both PMTs, in the Project Files, and on&#13;
the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated as required to reflect actual project&#13;
iniplementation and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
63.      Inaddition to the prior review of contracts (all proposed contracts are subject to prior review),&#13;
procurement supervision will be carried out from Bank offices. Where security conditions make travel to&#13;
Iraq impossible for international Bank staff, the Bank will employ an independent supervising agent&#13;
operating in Iraq to support the Bank in carrying out its supervision function. Inaddition, the Bank will&#13;
rely on reports from consulting firms, as well as the Bank's local procurement consultants working in&#13;
Iraq.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
64.      The Credit i s scheduled to close by June 30, 2010. The Disbursement Section o f Annex 7 shows&#13;
the allocation o f Credit proceeds by component and according to expenditure category, and provides a&#13;
disbursement schedule.&#13;
&#13;
65,      The Bank's strategy in Iraq i s to ensure ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by&#13;
financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient entities. Trained PMTs&#13;
will facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with the Bank's fiduciary and safeguards&#13;
requirements.     The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement, financial&#13;
management, and other areas, as needed.&#13;
&#13;
66.      As a further measure o f control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct payments.&#13;
Once authorized, direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly to contractors,' consultants,'&#13;
or suppliers' commercial bank accounts, or other financial intermediaries that are capable of receiving&#13;
funds transferred through the international banking system.       Retroactive financing o f eligible project&#13;
expenditures from M a r c h 1, 2006 until the expected date o f signing of the Financing Agreement will be&#13;
allowed up to an aggregate amount o f U S $ l O million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
67.      Project management support activities (under AS and B.4) and payments below the threshold o f&#13;
$20,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources, which will be&#13;
periodically reimbursed by the World Bank upon presentation of relevant supporting documents,&#13;
including proof o f payment, and signed withdrawal applications. Members o f both PMTs and the main&#13;
financial counterparts from the iniplementing agencies have been, and will continue to be, exposed to&#13;
training inthe Bank's disbursenient procedures.&#13;
&#13;
68..     Inaccordance withthe Country Financing Parameters approved for Iraqin September 2005, the&#13;
IDA Credit will finance 100 percent of project expenditures.                The MOCH's contribution to&#13;
implementation will include assigning staff to the P M T s and covering related operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
69.  .   The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) is the Representative o f the Recipient o f the Credit, and&#13;
accordingly, will sign the Financing Agreement. The MOF will make Credit proceeds available to the&#13;
SCRB and the GDRB through appropriate budgetary transfer arrangements under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the IDA.&#13;
&#13;
70.      Assessments o f the SCRB's and the GDRB's financial management systems were completed&#13;
during several meetings with SRCB and GDRB representatives in Amman, Jordan. The results o f the&#13;
assessments are available inthe Project Files.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The financial management risk i s rated as high. T o help diminish this risk, simplify financial&#13;
transactions, and ensure that the financial management systems at the SCRB and the GDRB are fully&#13;
responsive to the Bank's fiduciary requirements, measures will be taken t o support project accoiinting and&#13;
reporting functions. Direct payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants will be the primary tool for&#13;
financing  project activities. Reimbursements to the SCRB and the GDRB will also be made from time-&#13;
to-time for eligible expenditures paid from the Recipient's own resources. In addition, an international&#13;
financial management consultant will provide support to the P M T s to establish accounting systems for the&#13;
ERRP, prepare and subinit financial management reports (FMXs), and carry out relevant actions listed in&#13;
the Project Implementation Manuel. The project's financial statements will be audited annually by&#13;
external auditors in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards.          The international&#13;
auditor will b e hired at project launch and prior to any disbursements to certify that the ERRP's financial&#13;
management systems, processes, and functions meet the Bank fiduciary requirements and are fully&#13;
functional. The financial management arrangements and identified risks are detailed inAnnex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Bank Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
72.     Within twelve months of effectiveness, an Early Implementation Assessment review will be&#13;
undertaken to evaluate progress in implementing the ERRP, to reassess the relevance o f its design, and to&#13;
consider possible adjustments to address emerging priorities.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Untilsuch time as Bankteams are permittedto travel to Iraq, Bank supervision will becarried out&#13;
by local consultants hired under the Bank's budget for supervision. Direct input and feedback from the&#13;
PMTs will aIso play a central role in supervising implementation from a distance. Depending on the&#13;
availability and ability of Iraqi counterparts to travel, the Bank team will meet with relevant PMT&#13;
members inAmman, Jordan, preferably twice per year, or more frequently, as needed.&#13;
&#13;
74.     Since this i s an emergency operation, monitoring activities will focus on project outputs, rather&#13;
than outcomes. As such, the project will be monitored to ensure that basic tools for managing road assets&#13;
are restored, identifiedroads and bridges are rehabilitated, and lessons learned from road works supported&#13;
by the project are incorporated into multi-year road rehabilitation programs that will be developed under&#13;
the E W .&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
75.     The project was processed as an Emergency Recovery Project. Considering the emergency&#13;
situation and the current security conditions inIraq, the Environmental and Social Screening Assessment&#13;
FrameworkI6 (ESSAF) designed for Iraq will be used for this project. The main components of the&#13;
Project include rehabilitating highways, upgrading village access roads, rehabilitating and widening the&#13;
Erbil - Altun Kopri Road, replacing existing pontoon bridges with permanent structures, and providing&#13;
technical support. The environmental safeguard guidelines have been discussed with counterparts and the&#13;
requirements o f the various components defined.          Under Bank guidelines for emergency projects,&#13;
environmental management         plans   (EMP) including mitigation,         monitoring and institutional&#13;
strengthening-capacity building measures, are required for the road rehabilitation and village access roads&#13;
before construction begins. Full environmental impact assessments (EIAs) (Category A) will be prepared&#13;
for rehabilitating and upgrading the main road fiom Erbil to Altun Kopri, and for replacing existing&#13;
pontoon bridges with pennanent structures.&#13;
&#13;
76.     The PMT will develop the EMPs for the road rehabilitation and village access roads within the&#13;
context of the ESSAF, and with the assistance o f consultants (see Annex 8). Terms o f reference (TORs)&#13;
&#13;
Erbil - Allun Kopri Road were developed and assessments are on going and will be completed by June&#13;
for an independent environmental consultant to cany out full EIAs for rehabilitating and upgrading the&#13;
&#13;
15, 2006. An environmental consultant will also cany out a full EL4for any new bridges that will replace&#13;
existing pontoon bridges. The TORs for the EIA are based on World Bank safeguards provisions. The&#13;
EIAs shall be completed and be acceptable to the Bank before construction activities commence.&#13;
Environmental Specialists will be members o f the PMTs throughout the project's duration, and an&#13;
environmental consultant will be hiredfor a period o f about six months to prepare the EIAs, assist intheir&#13;
implementation, and train environmental specialists within the PMTs.&#13;
&#13;
77.     Land acquisition and resettlement is not anticipated. However, inthe event that it i s required, all&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement activities will be carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines set&#13;
forth inthe ESSAF, and no land or assets will be acquired outside o f the ESSAF guidelines. Sub-projects&#13;
that will require the demolition o f houses or the acquisition o f productive land will be carefully reviewed&#13;
to niinimize or avoid negative impacts by assessing alternative alignments.             A format for Land&#13;
Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet has also been prepared and i s part o f the ESSAF (see Annex 8,&#13;
Appendix 8.3 (i)).&#13;

&#13;
79.      Since its objective i s to help improve the reliability and efficiency o f road assets throughout the&#13;
country, and to strengthen management capacities, significant benefits will likely result from&#13;
implementing the ERRP. This will promote the country's economic integration, facilitate trade, and&#13;
support reconstruction efforts across all sectors.                          Although the ERRP i s essentially an emergency&#13;
operation, substantial benefits will also be derived from attempts to address medium- to long-termpolicy&#13;
and institutional issues, and by developing a vision for how road sector assets should be managed and&#13;
developed beyond the emergency stage. The civil works and subsequent maintenance activities will&#13;
provide local eniployment opportunities, and significant indirect benefits are anticipated as a result of the&#13;
E W .&#13;
&#13;
80.       Given the security conditions in Iraq, and the difficulty o f obtaining reliable traffic data and&#13;
information about the highway network, cost-benefit analyses would be difficult to complete for each of&#13;
the road sections identified for rehabilitation.                        Significant reconstruction i s not expected, and the&#13;
economic rate o f return (ERR) on road rehabilitation i s nonnally very high, typically inthe order of 30&#13;
percent. As an illustration, the economic ERR for a typical road segment was calculated, using the&#13;
HDM4model and the results show an ERR inexcess o f 25 percent."                                            For other components, including&#13;
the proposed village access roads and bridge improvements, economic analyses will be carried out to&#13;
demonstrate that ERRSare above 12 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     RISKS&#13;
&#13;
81,       In post-conflict situations, hostilities are often localized, which provides opporhinities for works&#13;
to be carried out in safer areas. However, contractors and consultants working inIraq will face highrisks,&#13;
and special arrangements may be needed to ensure a reasonable level o f protection. Specific measures&#13;
will be incorporated in contracts, ifneeded, to effectively reduce risks, and ultimately, associated costs.&#13;
&#13;
82.      The table on the following page identifies potential risks that could prevent the ERRP's&#13;
implementation, and proposes corresponding mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The HDM4 exercise will be recalculated at the time of the early iniplementatioii assessment review, or about one&#13;
  year after project launch, when better information on traffic counts should be available. This will contribute to&#13;
  more accurate results.&#13;

&#13;
        Since iniprovements to road assets are critical to the overall success of the E W , additional economic&#13;
        and social indicators focusing on the physical outputs (works) should be devised. Baseline indicators will&#13;
        be developed and then measured o n an annual basis. The additional indicators should not be overly&#13;
        complex or difficult to measure, and shouldbe based on readily available infomiation. The following are&#13;
        suggested indicators, which could apply to Parts A and B, were made:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                 Annex 3: Detailed Project Description&#13;
1.       The ERRP consists o f two parts: Part A, which covers the 15 central and southem Governorates;&#13;
and Part B, which focuses on sub-projects in the three Governorates o f the Kurdistan Regional&#13;
Government (KRG). Parts A and B will be implemented independently by the SCRB and the KRG-&#13;
GDRB respectively.&#13;
&#13;
Part (A) Project Components for the 15 Central and Southern Governorates&#13;
2.       Part A o f the proposed E W , which covers the 15 central and southern Governorates, has five&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
Component A.1: Highvny Rehabilitntioii works&#13;
3,       This component consists o f rehabilitating about 300 km of priority sections o f the highway&#13;
network. The works, which are located in different Governorates, involve critical road sections with&#13;
disintegrating pavements. The lengths o f road to be rehabilitated in each Governorate vary from ten km&#13;
to forty km. The identified road sections, which are on highways connecting main cities, are in bad&#13;
condition and cause major travel delays. The roads targeted are the most heavily trafficked and carry&#13;
more than 3,000 vehicles per day. The works consist mainly of pavement repairs and strengthening, but&#13;
also shoulder stabilization, road fLimishings, including lane marlung and traffic signs, new guardrails, and&#13;
drainage repairs.&#13;
&#13;
4.       It i s expected that about ten priority sub-projects will be launched in summer 2006 usingdesigns&#13;
and documentation prepared by SCRB staff.             These sub-projects, which counterparts identified as&#13;
priorities, were selected because they act as bottlenecks on high traffic volume roads, are located in areas&#13;
where security i s better, and are in the vicinity o f adjacent sections o f the same routes that were recently&#13;
improved. Later during implementation, additional sub-projects will be implemented based on designs&#13;
improved by outside consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.       Designs for each of the initial ten sub-projects are being elaborated and finalized by SCRB staff&#13;
based on a review by Bank staff. Designs are made flexible to allow different repairs and strengthening&#13;
measures to be included at a later date, should variation orders be neededduring construction. This i s due&#13;
to the rapid deterioration o f the road and the need to act quickly. For many the same reasons, the tender&#13;
documents o f the ten roads also require the contractor, duringmobilization and within a month o f order to&#13;
proceed, to carry out more detailed condition surveys o f the pavement o f project roads. The surveys will&#13;
include road roughness measurements, deflection, and test pits with new testing o f pavement layer&#13;
properties.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The sub-projects are expected to cost less than US$5.0 million each, and will not require pre-&#13;
qualification o f contractors. The SCRB will seek to establish pass-fail criteria for post-qualification in a&#13;
manner that will be easy to verify during bid evaluation. To the extent possible, the SCRB will try to&#13;
limit the number o f contractors duringthe start-up phase because of the complexity o f managing several&#13;
smaller projects at the same time, and to achieve economies o f scale through a reduced number o f&#13;
contracts. The first contracts are expected to be tendered and awarded by August 2006.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      - 2 1-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coniponent A.2: VillageAccess Rods&#13;
7.       This component will upgrade about 150 luii o f village access roads in several locations. It will&#13;
consist o f reconstniction and rehabilitation o f numerous access roads between isolated villages in various&#13;
Governorates. Improvements to these rural access roads will facilitate travel and commerce by reducing&#13;
travel times and costs, and by facilitating the movement o f agricultural products from farms to markets.&#13;
These roads will b e selected based on their level o f degradation and their highimpact on accessibility.&#13;
&#13;
8.       A first set o f roads (about 100 km)has been identified in four disadvantagedGovernorates. This&#13;
is based on several factors, including the: (i)conditions o f the roads compared to alternatives in other&#13;
Governorates; (ii)  security situation inproject areas; (iii)&#13;
                                                            importance of the selected roads as laid out in an&#13;
SCRB table of rural accessibility situation in all Governorates; (iv) volume o f expected traffic; and (v)&#13;
priorities o f each Governorate. D u e to the present lack o f appropriately detailed designs, and the need to&#13;
have the road rehabilitation component tendered first to get a better overview of available funds for&#13;
village access roads, the first half o f this component will be tendered six months after the road&#13;
rehabilitation component has been awarded (about October 2006). These will include reconstructing and&#13;
rehabilitating:&#13;
         (a) 25 lun of village roads in Maysan Governorate split in two sections o f 10 km and 15 kni to&#13;
              improve access to A1 Mushamh, Shuwaity, A1Magsood and Sayid Ahmed Refaee villages;&#13;
         (b) 30 km o frural roads in Diyala Governorate split into five road sections of varying lengths;&#13;
         (c) 30 km of village roads in Najaf Governorate (there are six road sections involved, and&#13;
              upgradingthese sections will benefit more that ten villages); and&#13;
         (d) 25 km o f village roads in Wasit Governorate involving the construction of an 18 km section&#13;
              from Zubaidiah to UmmSalim Road, and a 7 kmsection in Juwaimisa AI Sharqiah.&#13;
9.       Duringimplementation, a multi-year village access road improvement program will be prepared.&#13;
Those Governorates that were not covered by the first set o f road improvements will be given priority.&#13;
Evenhially, all Govemorates will b e covered through the road budget in an equitable manner based on an&#13;
approved program.&#13;
&#13;
Comporzeiit A.3: Bridge Replnceriie11b&#13;
10.      A limited number of critical river crossings (about three) will be provided with safer and&#13;
permanent structures. The A1 M a g i d Bridge, kvhich is located in A1 Magid Municipality in A1 Muthanna&#13;
Governorate, passes over the Euphrates River and links the t o w n of Chamcha. The existing bridge i s a&#13;
deteriorated one-lane floating bridge, 87 meters long, five meters inwidth, and supported by 15 pontoons.&#13;
It effectively blocks all river transport.     T h e niunicipality of A1 M a g i d and the sunounding large&#13;
agriculhiral areas located to the east o f the Euphrates River become largely isolated during the rainy&#13;
season. The planned improvements to the bridge will connect the area and its residents to Highway No.&#13;
8, thereby facilitating access to essential services and promoting trade and commerce.&#13;
11.      The existing structure will be replaced with a permanent 160 meters long, 12 meters wide,&#13;
permanent concrete bridge. The n e w structure will facilitate travel and commerce inthe A1 Magidregion&#13;
in general, and in Chamcha in particular. It will improve navigation on Iraq's inland waterways, and&#13;
facilitate the movement of agricult~iralproducts from farms t o markets.          Worlts associated with this&#13;
project include concrete piers and abutments, a 20 c m reinforced concrete deck slab paved with asphalt&#13;
concrete; pre-stressed concrete girders (20 meters long), and approach roads 140 meters long with asphalt&#13;
concrete surfacing, pipe culvert and other complementary works. SCRB has completed the bridge design&#13;
and tender docunients usinginternational standards.&#13;
&#13;
12.      A1IbrahimiaBridge passes over the Shatt A1HillRiver, a tributary to the Euphrates River, and is&#13;
located in Al Ibrahimia Municipality in the Governorate o f Babil. The existing bridge is a deteriorated&#13;
one-lane floating bridge that i s 5 meters in width. It effectively blocks navigational access to the area.&#13;
The new permanent two-way concrete bridge will be 90 meters long, 12 meters wide, and will facilitate&#13;
travel and commerce in A1 Ibrahimia and the Hillah Region. This bridge will link two main roads and&#13;
hv0 large agrarian areas. It will also link agricultural areas to the west o f the river with markets to the&#13;
&#13;
                                                     - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
east. The SC'RB has completed the design and tender documents. The construction o f the bridge will&#13;
also create eniploynient oppoi-tunities for the local people and therefore benefits the local economy both&#13;
directly and indirectly.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The A1Daraji Bridge is located in the Governorate o f A1Muthanna and passes over the Euphrates&#13;
River. The existing structure is a deteriorated one-lane pontoon bridge with a width of five meters. A&#13;
permanent two-way concrete bridge will facilitate travel and commerce between towns, such as A1Daraji&#13;
and A1 Sabkha located on the eastern side o f the Euphrates River, with agricultural lands and towns,&#13;
including UmmAr Rawj and Arbayin, to the west. It will also improve navigation on the river, and the&#13;
movement of agricultural products from farm to market. The project involves replacing the existing&#13;
structure with a new 245 ineter long, twelve meter wide permanent bridge in reinforced concrete. The&#13;
primary beneficiaries are the residents o f A1 Daraji and the area surrounding it. In addition, businesses&#13;
and workers engaged in the construction industry, mainly urban poor and local contractors, would also&#13;
benefit  from the construction o f the A1 Daraji Bridge. The SCRB has completed the design and tender&#13;
documents, and the project will be tendered locally with international consultants responsible for design&#13;
review and constructionsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
14.      As a measure o f effectiveness, the SCRB will inonitor traffic on the bridges and the nearby road&#13;
networksbefore and after iniplenientation o feachproject.&#13;
&#13;
Coinpoileiit A.4: Road Asset Maiingeinent aitd Road Rehabilitatioii Prograntniiizg.&#13;
15.      This component will help develop cost effective road rehabilitation and maintenance strategies&#13;
and establish a hlly functioning road assets management system for the 15 Governorates. This will entail&#13;
preparation o f a multi-year national highway rehabilitation and maintenance prograin with associated&#13;
financing     plan and capacity building measures. A village access road program will also be prepared to&#13;
guide rural accessibility improvements. These programs will be established in a manner that will allow&#13;
the road agency to update them annually, and make them instruments in the annual programming o f&#13;
works. The programs will also helpjustify spending levels.&#13;
 16.     For such systems to function w e l l and be sustainable, support i s also needed for:&#13;
          -   procuring equipment, including appropriate tools/softvvare, to regularly survey and monitor the&#13;
              performance o f roadpavements;&#13;
          ----setting-up a computerizedroad data base;&#13;

          - preparingaprogramfor rural accessibility improvements for all Governorates; and&#13;
          -   developing a strategy and detailed program for continual rehabilitation and maintenance o f the&#13;
              road network.&#13;
&#13;
Compoiient A.5: Project Mmtagement.&#13;
 17.     Project Management support will be provided to manage project activities and provide on-the-job&#13;
training in project management. The Credit will finance the costs o f setting up a Project Management&#13;
Team under the Ministry of Construction and Housing inBaghdad, including necessary office equipment&#13;
and materials, technical assistance and training, and other related costs.&#13;
&#13;
Part (B) ProjectComponents for the Three Northern Governorates&#13;
 18.     Part (B) o f the ERRP will be implemented in the three northern Governorates and have four&#13;
coniponents:&#13;
Coiiipoiteitt B.1:Rehabilitrrtioir and Upgradiiig of the 38.5 kin long Erbil- Altm Kopri Road&#13;
 19.     This component consists o f rehabilitating and widening the congested and accident prone Erbil-&#13;
Altun Kopri Road from a two-lane single carriageway with gravel shoulders to a four-lane dual&#13;
carriageway with sealed shoulders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          -23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.      The works involve rehabilitating the pavement and shoulders o f the current cai-riageway,&#13;
including drainage and structure improvements. In addition, the plan is to widen the road by adding a&#13;
second parallel carriageway in close proximity to the existing road within the prevailing right-of-way.&#13;
This will minimize the need for land acquisition and any resettlement o f project affectedpersons, as there&#13;
are no developments along the existing road within the right-of-way. The plan i s to continue upgrading&#13;
this critical trade corridor to Kirhik under a follow-on project. The environmental and social effects of&#13;
widening the road are mainly positive, and will: (i)lower road accidents by segregating traffic on two&#13;
physically separated carriageways, and by widening the shoulders to allow more space for non-motorized&#13;
transport; and (ii)reduce congestion and emissions from traffic. Any negative environmental effects&#13;
during construction will be addressed through an EL4 in line with the Bank's requirements and the&#13;
ESSAF.&#13;
&#13;
Comporieiit B.2: VillageAccess R o d s&#13;
21.      This sub-component will upgrade about 75 km of access roads in three locations connecting&#13;
remote villages in the Kurdistan Region. Improvements to these rural access roads will facilitate travel&#13;
and commerce by reducing travel times and vehicle operating costs, and by facilitating the movement o f&#13;
agricultural products from farms to markets. The amount available will be used to upgrade about 25 km&#13;
ineach of the three northernGoveniorates. Candidates for improvements include:&#13;
          (a) village access roads connecting the Walatey and Zherey villages in Erbil Governorate (28&#13;
              km);&#13;
          (b) reconstructing the Atrosh-Beboze-Kanybaska-Kharza Road, and upgrading the Bagirat-&#13;
              Galbok-Khirabyah-Bihiri-Khorpinyeh Road (both roads are located in the Dohtik&#13;
              Governorate) (22 km); and&#13;
          (c) upgrading the Chainchanial Sangaw Road, and reconstructing the Dolcan&#13;
                                          -                                              - Kelsa Road, both&#13;
              inSulaimanyahGovernorate (25 km).&#13;
&#13;
22.       Inthe three northern Governorates, the most urgent village access roads with significant levels of&#13;
traffic will be constructed using cost effective designs with a minimum of a six meter black top paved&#13;
surface using double bituminous surface treatment or graded gravel seals. The pavement design will be&#13;
carried out using TRL Road Note 31, or equivalent design standards. Inthe 15 Governorates, a six-meter&#13;
wide asphalt concrete pavement will be constructed initially with minimal shoulders. Roads with less&#13;
traffic will also be constructed with bituminous seals instead o f the usual 10 cni asphalt concrete, as was&#13;
customary before, in order to provide wider access to more communities and reach a larger geographical&#13;
area over a shorter time.&#13;
&#13;
Component B.3: Road.4sset itlirnageiiieirt nrid Road RehabilitationPrograiiiiiiiiig.&#13;
23.       This initiative will develop road rehabilitation and maintenance management strategies and&#13;
establish a fully fbnctioning road asset management system for the three KRG Govemorates. This will&#13;
entail preparation o f a highway rehabilitation and maintenance program, as well as a village access road&#13;
program. Support i s also provided for: (a) procuring needed equipment; (b) establishing a road data base;&#13;
(c) canyiiig out an inventory o f all roads and bridges to make the database operational; (d) completing&#13;
annual traffic counts and monitoring road conditions; (e) preparing a rural accessibility program; and (0&#13;
developing a strategy and program for rehabilitating and maintaining the road network.&#13;

                          Annex 4: Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
1.       The ERRP consists o f two parts: (a) Part A, which covers the 15 central and southern&#13;
Governorates and will be implemented by the State Commission for Roads and Bridges; and (b) Part B,&#13;
which focuses o n sub-projects in the three Goveinorates o f the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)&#13;
and will be implemented by the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Although the Project has been split into two parts, there will only be one Financing Agreement&#13;
between IDA and the Republic of Iraq. However, in the documentation for the Credit, full responsibility&#13;
for the works in the KRG Region, including procurement, financial management and safeguard activities,&#13;
will be assigned to the KRGGeneral Directorate for Roads and Bridges.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Based o n the ITF-financed projects, the proposed management structure for the ERRP will be&#13;
simple. It incorporates the Project Management Team model, whereby staff from various departments&#13;
within the implementingministry and its agencies is seconded on a full-time and/or on a part-time basis to&#13;
work in the PMT, and are supported by outside consultants from time-to-time and on an as-needed basis.&#13;
Experts financed under the proposed IDA Credit will support the PMT, at least initially, to ensure&#13;
appropriate fiduciary arrangements and independent audits, and to provide necessary training in this&#13;
respect. Funds will also b e available for short-term professionals providing on-the-job training in review&#13;
o f technical designs and quality enhancement activities. The PMT model will provide the slulls needed&#13;
for effective project implementation, yet permit the reintegrated o f seconded staff into their respective&#13;
ministry structures at project conipletion.&#13;
&#13;
4.       There will b e two PMTs, one at the State Commission for Roads and Bridges within the Ministry&#13;
of Construction and Housing in Baghdad, and the other at the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges&#13;
inthe KRG. The PMT at the SCRB will be responsible for implementing sub-projects inthe central and&#13;
southern Governorates, while the PMT at the GDRB will implement sub-projects in the three northern&#13;
Governorates. The two P M T s will also be responsible for managing all project activities under their&#13;
jurisdictions,  including contract management,        supervision and quality control, reporting,       and&#13;
administration o f project fiinds.  A key challenge initially will be to empower the two PMTs to make&#13;
effective decisions on procurement, and make payments efficiently to suppliers, consultants and&#13;
contractors.&#13;
&#13;
5.        The structure and staffing of the PMTs were defined and agreed with the relevant line ministries.&#13;
In addition to Project Managers, PMT staff will include senior technical staff (highway engineers),&#13;
procurement specialists, financial   management specialists, accountants, environmental focal points, and&#13;
administrative support staff.&#13;
&#13;
6.        The Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation will act as the coordinating agency&#13;
responsible for budgeting, counterpart funding and co-financing from bilateral donors or the ITF.&#13;
Appropriate mechanisms for donor coordination will be established through regular meetings between&#13;
donors supporting the road sector. MOPDC will coordinate these meetings.&#13;
&#13;

2.        The overall responsibilities of MOCH are to constnict roads, bridges, housing, and buildings&#13;
through state companies, state commissions, or foreign and local contractors. The main body involved in&#13;
the road sector is the State Commission for Roads and Bridges. SCRB staff also supervise projects and&#13;
cany out maintenance activities.            State construction companies are responsible for constructing most&#13;
M O C H projects. The total number of staff within the MOCH, including state contracting companies, i s in&#13;
excess o f 22,000, as indicated inTable 1.&#13;

4.      The involveinent of the SCRB inthe roads sector has a long history under different ministriesand&#13;
names. After Independence, the first Ministryresponsible for the roads sector was the Minishy o f Works&#13;
and Transportation. In 1957, the "Board o f Development" was established under the "Ministry of&#13;
Development."      The "Public Work Establishment" was then replaced by the "General Directorate of&#13;
Roads &amp; Bridges," which was responsible for constnicting rural roads and large bridges. The Public&#13;
Work Departments of the Governorates and municipalities took responsibility for principal urban and&#13;
village roads.    Construction o f major roads (arterial, expressway) and large bridges that cross the&#13;
Euphrates and Tigris Rvers, and the Shat a1 Arab Waterway and its tributaries were tendered ainong&#13;
international constructional finns. But after the formation of the "State Constructional Company"" and&#13;
the "State Organization of Roads &amp; Bridges" in 1976, both attached to the Ministry o f Construction and&#13;
Housing, several major projects of roads and bridges were executed departmentally using in-house&#13;
machineries and equipment staffed entirely by local manpower. In 1985, the construction functions of the&#13;
State Organization of Roads &amp; Bridges were transferred to several constructional state companies still&#13;
working at the present tinie.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
J .&#13;
C       The State Organization of Roads &amp; Bridges changed its name in 1957 to the State Conmission&#13;
for Roads and Bridges. Its activities limited to design and supervision o f road and bridge projects, and&#13;
maintenance and procurement of works. Inthe Kurdistan region, the equivalent of SClU3 in the regional&#13;
government is the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The SCRB terminated in-house construction activities in 1998, which led to establishment of&#13;
several private construction companies. Today, there are more than 300 contractors classified in the top&#13;
five categories. The SCRI3 classifies contractors on a scale from 1 to 10 based on capability o f handling&#13;
contracts. Table 2 categorizes the current nuinber of Iraqi contractors.&#13;

7.      Although there are numerous Iraqi consulting finns with specialized expertise in several&#13;
engineering fields, the consulting industry is not well developed. Table 3 lists finns that are registered&#13;
with the Iraqi Engineers Union.&#13;

8.      The SCRB has similar staffing problems as other ministries in terms o f numbers o f qualified&#13;
engineers. Nonetheless, the SCRB has an understandably higher ratio of engineers (22 percent) than the&#13;
MOT, which i s due to the direct involvement inthe design and supervision o f road projects. Table 4 lists&#13;
the numbers o f SCRB staff within each Governorate.&#13;

13.      Like its counterpart in Baghdad, the KRG-MOCH plays the dominate role in the road sector and&#13;
i s the principal entity responsible for roads, bridges, tunnels, and housing throughout the three northern&#13;
Governorates. It i s accountable for setting and implementing road sector policy, and for ensuring that&#13;
relevant laws andregulations are enforced.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The KRG-MOCH delegates responsibility for maintaining highways and roads, including road&#13;
sector assets located outside o f municipal boundaries, to the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges&#13;
(GDRB). Inthis capacity, the GDRB conducts feasibility and technical studies and prepares engineering&#13;
designs.    Through its provincial Directorates, it carries out works or contracts with contractors for&#13;
constniction and maintenance activities, and supervises works. It also has primary responsibility for&#13;
maintaining, operating and equipping bridges, tunnels, and weight stations. The total number o f staff&#13;
withinthe KRG-MOCK is showninTable 8, while staffing levels at the GDRB are shown inTable 9.&#13;

                                       Annex 5: Transport Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
  1.       Once regarded as having one o f the Middle East's most comprehensive transportation systems,&#13;
Iraq's transport infrastnicture has suffered from more than two decades o f neglect and underinvestment.&#13;
Between 19x0 and 2003, regional conflicts, the utilization o f public resources to support military&#13;
initiatives, an extended period o f economic sanctions, and deferred maintenance contributed to a&#13;
pernicious and general decline in the quality o f transport facilities and services, and to huge losses in&#13;
rolling stock. With the onset o f the 2003 militaiy intervention, many assets were damaged due to the&#13;
heavy bombing that occurred, while the looting that followed stripped ministries and transport facilities of&#13;
equipment, machineiy, furniture and supplies. Inaddition to these challenges, Iraq must transition from a&#13;
centrally-planned, command economy to one that i s market based.                           As a result, the country faces&#13;
enornious challenges in reconstructing its transportation networks and facilities, as well as in re-&#13;
establishingkey transport services.&#13;
Roads iirid Bt.ir1p.s&#13;
&#13;
2.         Iraq's 42,000 kilometer road network i s classified as national highways, primary roads, secondary&#13;
roads, village access roads and special purpose roads (military and border roads). Although some 85&#13;
percent of the network i s paved, damages sustained during numerous conflicts, inadequate repairs, and&#13;
deferred maintenance have rendered much o f the network to fair or poor condition18. As a result, a large&#13;
 share of roads i s in immediate need of rehabilitation. There has also been a pronounced deterioration o f&#13;
village access roads, which has diminished access to markets and social services in many niral areas. The&#13;
topography o f Iraq, with two major river systems along which most cities are located, makes bridges a&#13;
 vital part of the road network. As a result of the first Gulf War and subsequent conflicts, many o f the&#13;
 country's more than 1,000 bridges suffered damage, and several key river crossings were never provided&#13;
 with replacement bridges. Instead, temporary struchires (floating bridges) were put inplace.&#13;
&#13;
 3.        Responsibility for constructing and maintaining the classified road network, except for roads&#13;
within municipalities, lies with the Ministry of Construction and Housing (MOCH), and specifically the&#13;
 State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB). However, policy formulation and planning activities&#13;
 for the road sector are the responsibilities of the Ministry o f Planning and Development Cooperation.&#13;
 Local roads in cities and towns under the jurisdiction o f municipalities are the responsibility o f the&#13;
 Ministry o f Municipalities and Public Works. Inthe northern Governorates, there is a regional Ministry&#13;
 o f Construction and Housing and a General Directorate o fRoads (GDRB) that mirror the structure of, and&#13;
have similar responsibilities as, the MOCH and the SCRB. This arrangement has been inplace for about&#13;
ten years.&#13;
&#13;
4.         The consulting industry in Iraq encompasses four types o f public and private instihitions: (a)&#13;
 engineering offices in ministries; (b) consulting services offered by universities; (c) government-owned&#13;
 consulting corporations; and (d) privately owned consulting firms. Inthe 1970s, there were a number o f&#13;
private consulting firms in all fields of engineering, but due to a change inpolicy requiring ministries to&#13;
rely on in-house expertise and parastatal consulting coi-porations, the quality and capacity o f the private&#13;
sector deteriorated to the extent that it no longer offers services in the transport sector. This i s partly&#13;
because the SCRB and the GDRB have developed and relied on its in-house capacityI9 to design most o f&#13;
the country's roads and bridges, and because the universities have been encouraged to carry out the&#13;
technically more difficult studies. The main parastatal consulting corporation i s the National Center for&#13;
Engineering Consultancy, which has some capabilities in the area o f road and bridge design. Few of these&#13;
institutions have experience in undertaking independent construction supervision as the "Engineer"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~~       ~~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Fifty percent o f national highways, 70 percent of primary roads, SO percent of secondary roads, and 90 percent o f village&#13;
    access roads are consideredto be in fair or poor condition. Overall, it is estimated that just six percent of the road network is&#13;
    in good condition, 56 percent is infair condition, and 32 percentis inpoor condition.&#13;
&#13;
    The SCRB and the GDW have local offices in each of the I S Governorates, and used to have a well-developed collection of&#13;
    national laboratories for testing of materials and road works.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                - 3 8-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
according to the Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs Conseils (FDIC) conditions o f contract. The&#13;
Iraqi EngineeringUnion classifies engineering fimis and licenses professional engineers.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The road construction industry in Iraq can be classified in two main categories: (a) private&#13;
entrepreneurs; and (b) state-owned construction corporations. The capacity and capabilities o f the private&#13;
sector has been depleted due to years o f war and increased reliance on parastatal corporations. Presently,&#13;
it can only offer sub-contracting services to larger foreign companies. The Iraqi Contractors' Federation&#13;
has ten classifications for contractors, but only publicly owned corporations are in the top category.&#13;
However, several have the experience and equipment to carry out works for roads, bridges, buildingsand&#13;
other infrastructure, and the local consulting and contracting industries have been instrumental in past&#13;
reconstruction efforts, particularly after the 1991 Gulf War. One can also expect that private sector&#13;
contractors, with some facilitation and opportunities for road and bridgework, could expand their&#13;
capabilities and compete with the publicly owned corporations, as well as foreign contractors.&#13;

6.       Iraq has one o f the region's most extensive railway networlts with a total length o f 2,456 knithat&#13;
includes 1,905 km o f main lines and 551 km o f branch lines. The network connects the main activity&#13;
centers o f the country, and has four main standard-gauge lines: (i)   the single track Baghdad-Basra-Umm&#13;
Qasr Line (609 km, 43 stations); (ii)   the single track Baghdad-Mosul-Syrian Border Line (524 km, 20&#13;
stations); (iii)&#13;
               the mostly single track (double track on Baghdad-Ramadi) Baghdad-A1 Qaim-Akasat Line&#13;
(520 km, 30 stations); and (iv) the single track Kirkuk-Baiji-Maditha Line (252 km, 14 stations).&#13;
&#13;
7.       The North-South Axis, which includes the two main railway lines from Baghdad-Basra-Umm&#13;
Qasr and the Baghdad-Mosul-Ramadi Lines, represent the backbone o f the system. The North-South axis&#13;
connects the Port o f Umm Qasr with the country's three main cities (Baghdad, Basra and Mosul), and i s&#13;
the only existing international connection with Syria and Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Iraqi Railways Corporation (IRC), the state-owned operator, currently has about 350 main line&#13;
locomotives, some 8,800 freight wagons, and around 214 passenger coaches of various types. However,&#13;
n o more than 165 locomotives are in operational condition, while SO percent of wagons and less than 60&#13;
percent of coaches are reported as being available.         The combined effects of successive wars and&#13;
economic sanctions, which damaged facilities and assets, severely limitedbudgets, and prevented access&#13;
to spare parts, have rendered the network in poor condition. The condition o f tracks i s very poor, and&#13;
derailments are frequent, despite speed restrictions. Telecommunications and signaling systems are not&#13;
ftinctional, and train movements are presently controlled using "ad hoc" methods that do not adequately&#13;
enswe safety and hamper capacity o f the lines (there are presently about four trains per day on each o f the&#13;
networks main lines). Inaddition, the institutional structure o f rail operations i s concentrated inthe IRC,&#13;
which plans, undertakes construction and maintenance activities, and manages and operates all services.&#13;
Productivity i s low, and staff, while technically skilled, has only limited exposure to modem managerial&#13;
techniques and lacks the discipline o f commercially runorganizations.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Inview o f the present dismal situation o f the railway system, a stringent action plan is required.&#13;
It should not be limited to an emergency investment plan and should also cover technical and managerial&#13;
reorganization o f IRC. Selectivity and availability of adequate managerial capacity will be keys to the&#13;
success o f the action plan. The plan should include: (a) restructuring the IRC along business units and&#13;
intensive staff training program; (b) upgrading o f telecommunication, signaling and dispatching systems;&#13;
and (c) reorganizingmotive power and rolling stock maintenance.&#13;

 10.     Iraq has two international airports at Baghdad and Basra, and major domestic airports at Mosul,&#13;
Kirkukand Erbil. Years o fneglect and lack of fundingfor maintenance and spareparts havedramatically&#13;
reduced the usefulness o f these airports, and except for Baghdad and Basra, none i s capable o f supporting&#13;
commercial air operation.&#13;

11.      The Iraq Civil Aviation Authority, with a staff o f about 1,200, i s responsible for administering all&#13;
civil aviation activities in Iraq, and for managing and operating all airports and the country's nearly 100&#13;
airfields. Baghdad airport has two runways o f 4,000 nieters and 3,300 meters, and operates on visual&#13;
flight rules due to the lack o f an instrument landing system. Equipment is lacking in all areas, and only&#13;
one terminal can service air traffic. Basra airport has one runway o f 4,000 meters and a single passenger&#13;
tei-niinal. Most facilities are inpoor condition.&#13;

12.       The country's seaports situated along or inland from the short stretch o f coastline between the&#13;
borders o f Iran and Kuwait, include Um Qasr, Khor a1 Zubair, Basra, Abu Flus, A1 Khasib and Fao. The&#13;
seaports provide essential linksbetweenIraq's land and international maritime traiisport networks.&#13;
&#13;
13.       Located adjacent to Kuwait, the Port of UmmQasr i s Iraq's most significant and only deep-water&#13;
port, although approach channels suffer from heavy siltation and must be dredged regularly."                 It is&#13;
situated on one o f the most important transport corridors serving the CoLintry, and is a vital node for&#13;
importing and exporting goods. The Port has a rated capacity o f ten million tons per year, good inter-&#13;
modal road and rail connections, and the potential to become an engine for economic growth and&#13;
development.      While its infrastructure is generally in good condition, the Port's superstructure and&#13;
equipment, obtained from various sources over the years, i s not. Years o f neglect, minimal maintenance,&#13;
and curtailed budgets have created a situation whereby significant assets are in an abandoned state. The&#13;
equipment available is insufficient, obsolete and unreliable. Chronic siltation and wrecked vessels in&#13;
approach channels also pose significant challenges.&#13;
&#13;
14.       The port o f Khor a1 Zubair is an industrial port 20 lm inland from Um Qasr, constructed to&#13;
handle bulk cargo including fertilizer, iron ore imports and petrochemical exports. It has a total o f 11&#13;
berths with an overall length of 2,450 meters. In the past, Basra was Iraq's main port but now, like Abu&#13;
F~L~SSA1 Khasib, is unusable because o f the many sunken vessels blocking the Shatt el-Arab&#13;
        and&#13;
waterway.     Fao i s a loading jetty on the Gulf cost handling supply vessels for offshore oil export&#13;
terminals.&#13;
&#13;
15.       The state-owned Iraqi Ports Company (PC), under the Ministryo f Transport (MOT), administers&#13;
and operates all ports in Iraq.       The MOT'S Technical Department, in collaboration with the port&#13;
administrations, establishes overall policy for the sector, and maintenance activities are carried out by the&#13;
IPC. The IPC has a total workforce o f around 10,000, about half o f which are stationed at IPC's&#13;
headquarters in Basra. Local contractors are employed by the IPC for stevedoring and some coiistruction&#13;
works.&#13;
&#13;
16.       Presently, the Ports o f Umm Qasr and Khor Al-Zubair handle more than 1.5 percent o f total&#13;
imports into Iraq, but have the potential o f becoming major cargo and container handling facilities for&#13;
Iraq. If better managed, they could capture a much greater share o f cargo now entering and,exiting the&#13;
country through ports inJordan, Syria and Turkey. To that end, they mustjointly serve as the "gateway"&#13;
to Iraq, and become competitive, both in terms o f price and efficiency. The future role o f Iraqi ports&#13;
would need to be detailed ina proposed Master Plan, which should include an institutionalreview, give a&#13;
clear assessment o f available assets, and articulate their use along the lines o f the Landlord Model under&#13;
transparent arrangements with private sector operators managing and operating the ports.&#13;

17.       Iraqi vessels were not allowed to operate inteinationally after 1990, but in that year the maritime&#13;
fleet contained 2.5 vessels, including fourteen cargo ships and eight oil tankers. At that time, Iraqi vessels&#13;
carried about eleven percent o f exports and ninepercent o f imports.&#13;

percent o f inland cargo on barges. The infrastructure and all barges suffered greatly from war damages&#13;
and the system is now moribund. Rehabilitation is not a priority.&#13;

 19.      Commercial freight transport by road has played a crucial role in Iraq's economy over the past&#13;
twenty years, when seaport and railway capacity were constrained and international air traffic closed.&#13;
The looting that occurred in 2003 seriously affected the sub-sector and in particular, public operators&#13;
suffered heavy losses o f vehicles, spare parts and equipment. Public sector companies dominate in road&#13;
transport: the General Corporation for Land Transport and the Dhilal Transport Corporation are both&#13;
owned 100 percent by the Government, while the Jordanian Iraqi Corporation for Land Transport and the&#13;
Syrian Iraqi Corporation for Land Transport are ownedjointly by the respective governments. There are&#13;
also three companies with mixed private-public ownership, as well as about 400 private transport&#13;
companies, mostly owner operated. The MOT regulates land transport activities, while the Ministry o f&#13;
Interior is responsible for licensing vehicles and drivers, and collecting annual fees and charges. In the&#13;
past, freight tariffs were regulated by the Parliament, but today, no tariff structure i s enforced, and rates&#13;
are very low due to extremely low fuel prices and an old vehicle fleet. This has also affected the quality&#13;
o f services offered.&#13;

20.       The public transport system plays a major role inproviding inter-city bus transport throughout the&#13;
country and internationally, municipal bus services for Baghdad and Basra, and local and long distance&#13;
taxis and shared taxis for all citizens o f Iraq. Not only did the sanctions o f the 1990s significantly impact&#13;
the ability o f public operators to maintain and renew bus fleets, they also curtailed private vehicle&#13;
ownership, which i s low compared to neighboring countries. Similar to what happened in most other&#13;
sectors, the looting that followed the 2003 conflict devastated bus fleets, public transport offices, and&#13;
maintenance facilities. These events have exerted tremendous pressure on public transport systems and&#13;
services, which remain the only means o f transport that i s affordable to the majority o f Iraqis."&#13;
&#13;
21.       Currently, a viable system i s in place with a publicly-owned entity, the General Corporation for&#13;
Managing Passenger Transport, serving as regulator and operating the country's 165 bus terminals and&#13;
bus-stations, including those in Baghdad. Two large public sector bus operators provide long distance&#13;
bus services. Two companies with mixed private-public ownership run local services in Baghdad and&#13;
Basra, while several small private operators also provide services, although quite limited incritical areas.&#13;
&#13;
22.       The Government-owned General Corporation for Passenger Transport provides bus services ar,d&#13;
owns the country's largest fleet of buses. Prior to the war, they were operating 1,000 buses along 132&#13;
routes in Baghdad, but are now only operating 318 buses. A 2004 survey indicated the following number&#13;
of passengers utilized Government-ownedbus services:&#13;
          - insideBaghdad-6,200,000&#13;
          - betweenGovernorates-927,000&#13;
          - international-15,000&#13;
          -     inside the Governorates, excluding Baghdad- 2,164,000&#13;
&#13;
23.       Although private companies also provide bus services in Iraq, there is no reliable information on&#13;
the total number o f operators offering private services in the country. It i s estimated, however, that&#13;
60,000 private vehicles, mostly GMC, taxi, vans and small buses, offer services. The 2004 survey also&#13;
showed that the total number of passengers traveling between Govemorates was 15,000,000, which&#13;
includes passengers traveling to Karbala and Najaf duringholy occasions.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
24.    Inthe past, Baghdad's public bus operations were good, and the restoration of reliable services on&#13;
safe and energy-efficient buses should be a priority. Working within existing constraints, there i s a need&#13;
to evolve the cui-rent system following modern principals for managing urban bus services, whereby the&#13;
public sector sets policy and provides appropriate regulatory functions, and private operators deliver&#13;
adequate and affordable services.&#13;

               Annex 6: Procurement Arrangements and Procurement Schedule&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
1.       To simplify the procurement process, the number o f contracts will be minimized. To facilitate&#13;
project implementation, SCRB and GDRB will hire qualified consulting firms to assist them to implement&#13;
all project components, including procurement and project management training, supervision o f the first&#13;
package o f works, supervision of subsequent road packages and bridge construction, development of an&#13;
appropriate strategy, and establishment of a systemto manage road assets.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Support to procurement activities will be included in the technical specifications o f the main&#13;
technical assistance contract (see Procurement Plan-Contract No.: ERRP.CON.QCBS.TA).&#13;
&#13;
3.       Procurement of Works. Works procured under this project will include the rehabilitation o f roads&#13;
sections in different governorates, as well as replacement o f old decaying floating bridges with permanent&#13;
concrete bridges. Procurement o f works will be mainly carried out using National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures. Works estimated to cost more than US$5 million equivalent per contract will be&#13;
procured using International Conipetitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The NCB standard bidding&#13;
documents for procurement o f works, which were prepared as part of the MIM, will b e used. Shopping&#13;
procedures, when needed, will be used for procurement o f works o f small value estimated at US$lOO,OOO&#13;
or less per contract.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Procirrenzent of Goods. Goods procured under this project will include road laboratory&#13;
equipment, IT and office fuiiiiture, equipment and supplies needed for project implementation, as well as&#13;
vehicles. Procurement will b e done using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB.&#13;
The NCB SDB for procurement of goods, which were prepared as part o f the MIM, will be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000. Shopping procedures will be used for procurement of&#13;
goods o f small value estimated at US$lOO,OOO or less per contract.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Selection of Coizsiiltrrnts. Consultants' services procured under this project will include: (i)&#13;
selection o f consultants to provide engineering services, such as reviewing, updating and finalizing&#13;
detailed designs and preparing tender documents; and (ii)selecting a specialized consulting firm and&#13;
individuals t o assist the PMT in project implementation, and training staff in procurement, financial&#13;
management, project management and other technical fields, as needed.             The selection method will&#13;
mainly be a Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) and advertising for expressions of interest (EOIs)&#13;
in the UNDB and local newspapers.           International consulting firms may not be interested in some&#13;
contracts while the security situation is volatile. Accordingly, it is possible that shortlists for consultants'&#13;
services for some contracts m a y b e composed entirely o f nationalhegional consultants. It is also expected&#13;
that consulting offices associated with local universities m a y b e included in the shortlists. University-&#13;
based consultants will not be given preference over private consultants.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Operating Costs: The Credit will finance expenditures directly related to the management o f the&#13;
project, such as: (i)maintenance o f ofiice equipment; (ii)    transportation and travel, including per d i e m&#13;
allowances for project staff in travel status; (iii) rental of office space; (iv) office supplies, utilities and&#13;
office  administration, including translation, printing and advertising; (v) fuel costs; (vi) communication&#13;
costs; (vii) costs for production of bidding documents and drawings; (viii) commercial bank charges; and&#13;
(ix) any other project management support costs as agreed by the Recipient and IDA, but excluding&#13;
salaries of the Recipient's civil servants. These items will b e financed by the project and will be procured&#13;
usingthe SCRB and GDRB administrative procedures for shopping, satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Procurenient Risk Assessment: The procurement risk is rated high. The risks associated with&#13;
procurement were identified and documented inthe SCRB and GDRB procurement capacity assessments&#13;
(inproject files); they include: (i) lack o f adequate procurement laws and regulations, and o f inodein&#13;
                                     the&#13;
documentation practices; (ii)habits acquired by procurement staff from the previous era, which will take&#13;
time to modify; (iii)  limited experience o f procurement staff in the use of Bank procurement guidelines&#13;
and inteiiiational sound procurement practice; (iv) limited access o f international Bank procurement staff&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
to supervise the project in the i&lt;eld; (v) delays in implementing the procurement plan due to lack o f&#13;
experience inprocurement planning and the volatile security conditions in Iraq; (vi) increase inprices o f&#13;
raw construction materials due to high demand and unavailability o f these materials, which may impact&#13;
subproject completion due to contractors' unwillingnessto continue work based o n old contract prices;&#13;
(vii) possible looting/daniage o f construction sites; and (viii) delays in bid submission and/or.&#13;
implementation due to poor security conditions in some areas in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
8.              Corrective measures that have been agreed include: (i)                                                         assigning two procurement officers at the&#13;
PMTs on a fdl-time basis (one each per PMT); (ii)recruiting a consulting firm that will assist the PMTs&#13;
inprocurement matters, train PMT staff on procurement, establish procurement monitoring and reporting&#13;
systems in the SCRB-PMT, and GDRB-PMT, and conduct physical spot inspections; and (iii)                                                                                                                        usingthe&#13;

6.       ProcurementPackageswith Methods and Time Schedule. It i s expected that one civil works&#13;
contract will be procured using ICB procedures. Other works contracts will be procured using NCB.&#13;
However, given the security conditions in Iraq, international/regional contractors may be reluctant to&#13;
subinit bids, and local contractors, which do not have a history o f producing financial statements or&#13;
providing information on their financial performance, may not be in a position to satisfactorily respond to&#13;
bids' financial criteria. This may need to be taken into consideration during the preparation o f bidding&#13;
documents by, for example, reducing the financial requirements for qualifying bidders. Goods will be&#13;
procured using ICB, N C B or shopping, depending on contract value. There i s no domestic preference&#13;
under the project. A detailed procurement plan i s attached.&#13;

  Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
  Srllllnraly&#13;
  1.       The project is divided into two parts: Part A will be implemented by the SCRB and Part B by the&#13;
' GDRB. Boththe SCRB andGDRB will establisha Project ManagementTeams (PMTs)to facilitate and&#13;
  manage project implementation. The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) i s the representative o f the Recipient of&#13;
  the Credit, andaccordingly, will signthe FinancingAgreement, The MOFwill makethe Credit available&#13;
  to the SCRB andthe GDRB through budgetary transfer arrangements acceptableto the IDA.&#13;
  2:       The financial resources extendedthrough the IDA Credit will be managed within the framework&#13;
  of the MOCH's financial management system and additional World Bank procurement and financial&#13;
  management procedures. The public sector's legal fiamework in the KRG, as described by GDRB,&#13;
  MOPDC, and MOF representatives, is similar to the framework for the other 15 central and southern&#13;
  Governorates.&#13;
  3.       Assessments o f the SCRE! and the GDRB's financial management systems were completed&#13;
  during several meetings with Iraqi representatives in Amman, Jordan. The purpose o f the assessments&#13;
  was to detemne whether the financial management arrangements at both entities were acceptable to the&#13;
  IDA, andto help identify areasto be strengthened. The results ofthe assessments, which were carried out&#13;
  at the country andproject levels, are available inthe Project Files.&#13;
  4.       The financial management risk is rated as high. To help diminish this risk, simplify financial&#13;
  transactions, and ensure that the financial management systems at the SCRB and the GDRB are fully&#13;
  responsive to the Bank's fiduciary requirements, measures will be taken to support project accounting and&#13;
  reporting functions. Direct payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants willbe the primary tool for&#13;
  fmancing project activities. Reimbursements to the SCRB and the GDRE! will also be made from time-&#13;
  to-time for eligible expenditures paid fkom the Recipient's own resources. Inaddition, an international&#13;
  financial management consultant will provide support to the PMTsto establish accounting systems for the&#13;
  ERRP, prepare and submit financial management reports (FMRs), and carry out relevant actions listedin&#13;
  the Project Implementation Manuel. The project's financial statements wil             e audited annually by&#13;
  external auditors inaccordance with internationally accepted auditing standards.&#13;
&#13;
  5.       Details of the risk ratings andagreed mitigatingmeasures are described inthe following sections.&#13;

  6.       A Country Financial Accountability Assessment has not been completed for Iraq. However,&#13;
  numerous reports, including the International Monetary Fund-World Bank April 2005 report on Iraq&#13;
  Public Financial Management2' show a high inherent risk in almost all main functions of financial&#13;
  management systems (budgeting, internal controls, accounting, reporting). The security situation, the&#13;
  weaknesses in the banking system, which hamper the domestic payment system and the accuracy of&#13;
  budgetreporting, andthe manyyears o fisolation that Iraqhas endured, have contributedto this risk.&#13;
&#13;
  7.       While the Bankmaybenefit from the limited knowledge acquired through the ITFprojects about&#13;
  the public financial systems inthe central and southern parts o f the country, it is not possible to do so for&#13;
  the northern Governorates. There isnoBank or other donor reports or assessments addressing the KRG's&#13;
  publicfinancial system, bankingsystem, or auditingenvironment.&#13;

  8.   Critical riskfactors at the project level that are common to boththe SCFU3 andthe GDRl3 include: (i)&#13;
  splitting the project into two parts; (ii)  limited capacity to meet`the project's financial management&#13;
  requirements; (iii) security conditions that prevent the Bank team from physically supervisingthe project;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv) difficulty in accounting for Bank projects separately, as the MOCH is currently managing many&#13;
projects involving multiple financiers; (v) delays in issuing authorizations for payment leading to overdue&#13;
payments; (vi) possible low level of coordination and reporting arrangements between the technical units&#13;
 at the 1s Governorates and both the SCRB and the GDRB; and (vii) not being able to maintain project&#13;
 accounts for payment of small amounts (less than US$20,000) leading to shortages andor delays in&#13;
payments and reimbursements,&#13;
&#13;
 9.   Risks related to the GDRB Part B include: (i)the possibility o f additional delays in payment&#13;
 authorization caused by the need to translate payment requests and supporting documents to Kurdish; (ii)&#13;
 lack of knowledge about the banking payment system in the KRG and impact on timely payments to&#13;
 contractors and consultants; and (iii)lack of h o w l e d g e of the auditing sector, its capacity and quality of&#13;

Project Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
10.      The risks identified above will be partly mitigatedthrough dual implementation and management&#13;
o f the project by the SCRB and the GDRB. Each P M T has designated a qualified Financial Management&#13;
Specialist to undertake the responsibilities o f maintaining contracts, ensuring timely authorization o f&#13;
payments, submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank, and keeping financial records for its part o f&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Payment Authorization and Flow o f Information. Financial activities, including invoicing for&#13;
advance payments or for actual incurred expenditures, are subject to both SCRB and GDRB controls and&#13;
procedures, as well as both PMTs' verification and approval processes. Adequate monthly monitoring&#13;
reports, sent by the technical implementation units or resident engineers at the Governorate level to both&#13;
PMTs, and linkmg physical progress with financial and procurement reports will help to inanage risks&#13;
associated with the geographical spread o f the ERRP's many sub-projects. The flowchart below depicts&#13;
the flow of information and authorizations requiredto issue payments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
12.       Accounting System.     Spreadsheet applications will be used to record the project's financial&#13;
transactions and to generate reports. Based on the number of contracts and paymentterms, the SCRB will&#13;
handle about 900 payments transactions, while the GDRB will process some 300 throughout&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
13,       Budgeting and Disbursement Forecasts. Both PMTs will maintain quarterly project budgets and&#13;
detailed disbursement plans for their respective parts. These plans will be developed based on the initial&#13;
procurement plan, and revised continuously to remain current. They will be used as monitoring tools to&#13;
analyze budget variances.&#13;
&#13;
14.       Reconciliation of Project Records. Both PMTs will reconcile accounts of funds disbursed by the&#13;
Bank with accounting records on a monthly basis. The Bank will n o t i b the M O F when disbursements&#13;
under the ERRP are made, and the MOF will record expenditures against the budget allocated for the&#13;
project. It will also be essential that the financial records of both PMTs be reconciled with those o f the&#13;
M O F on a monthly basis.&#13;

&#13;
1.       As outlined above, the project will be processed as an Emergency Recovery Project. Considering&#13;
the emergency situation and the current security conditions in Iraq, the Environmental and Social&#13;
Screening Assessment Frai~ework'~     (ESSAF) designed for Iraq will be used for this project. The main&#13;
components o f the ERRP include financing to:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) rehabilitate highly damaged highway segments;&#13;
         (b) upgrade village access roads;&#13;
         (c) rehabilitate and widen the main road from Erbilto Altun Kopri;&#13;
         (d) replace existing pontoonbridges; and&#13;
         (e) provide technical support.&#13;
&#13;
-.3      Considering the nahire and magnihide o f potential environmental impacts associated with the&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction works, most works associated with Components A.1, A.2, and B.2 are&#13;
classified as Category "B," which requires the development of Environmental Management Plans (EMF'),&#13;
including mitigation plans (control measures to reduce or eliminate to the extent possible the expected&#13;
impacts), monitoring plans (consisting primarily of field visual inspections and photographic&#13;
documentation should be implemented at the construction phase and be maintained at least one year after&#13;
completion of constniction activities), and institutional strengthening-capacity buildings measures&#13;
(development o f an environmental training course to be attendedby personnel who will be involvedinthe&#13;
constniction, maintenance or monitoring activities during both construction and operation). The PMTs&#13;
will develop the EMPs for the road rehabilitation and village access roads within the context of ESSAF&#13;
and with the assistance of the Bank. A proposed checklist o f likely environment and social impacts to be&#13;
filled out by the PMTs for each sub-project or group of sub-projects i s included in Appendix S.l.             The&#13;

the Tigris and the Euphrates a n d o r their tributaries, there are no potential impacts in the international&#13;
context and therefore the safeguard policy or OP 7.50 i s not applicable.&#13;
&#13;
7.        Capacity Building: As part o f the capacity building to be provided under the ERRP, the SCRB&#13;
and the KRG-GDRBwill hire independent consultants to prepare the EIAs, which will be completed and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank before construction begins. Environmental Specialists will be hired to be part of&#13;
the P M T s throughout project implementation, and an environmental consultant will be hiredfor a period&#13;
of about six months to review the EMS,assist in implementing the actions detailed inthe EMPs, and train&#13;
the environmental specialists within the PMTs.&#13;

A.      INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.      The EmergencyRoadRehabilitationProject ( E N ) includes the following components:&#13;
         0 Component A.3. Bridge Replacements that will provide a limited number of critical river&#13;
             crossings (about three) with safer and permanent structures by replacing their old decaying&#13;
             floating bridges with permanent two-way concrete bridges. The bridges are expected to be&#13;
             between 100 meters and 250 meters long, and about 12 meters wide. The bridges identified&#13;
             so far are located in the Governorates o f A1 Muthanna, Babil, and Anbar, and cross the&#13;
             Euphrates River or its tributaries.&#13;
         0 Component 31.Rehabilitatingandwidening the mainroadfromErbilto AltunKopri inErbil&#13;
             Governorate in Kurdistan. The 38.5 km road segment i s part o f the Erbil-Baghdad Highway&#13;
             and serves as a lifeline for the economy o f the Kurdistan Region. The existing two-lane&#13;
             cairiageway has about 22,000 vehicles a day, and due to the deterioration o f the pavement&#13;
             and frequent overtaking, there are about twelve 12 serious road crashes each day, resultingin&#13;
             many injuries and fatalities every year.      The road connects a number of villages and&#13;
             secondary roads, and provides access to not less than 80 villages on both sides o f the road at&#13;
             various distances. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) intends to first widen the&#13;
             existingroad by constructing a parallel camageway alongside the existing road. When this&#13;
             new carriageway is completed, all traffic will be transferred to the new carriageway, while&#13;
             the old carriageway is repaired and rehabilitated.&#13;
2.      Eiivironnterrtal Screening. The project will be processed as an Emergency Recovery Project.&#13;
Considering the emergency situation and the current security conditicns in Iraq, the Environmental and&#13;
Social Screening Assessment Framework designed for Iraq will be used for this project. The above&#13;
mentioned components (A.3 and B.l) are rated as Category "A" projects with no direct adverse social&#13;
impacts or land acquisition, since the additional lanes are within the right of way of the exiting road and&#13;
no settlements or inhabitants are reportedly within the right o f way.          Under Bank guidelines for&#13;
emergency projects, the Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) will be prepared before initiation o f&#13;
construction activities by the State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB) for Component A.3 and&#13;
by the General Directorate for Roads and Bridges (GDRB) inthe Kurdistan Region (KRG-GDRl3) for the&#13;
Component B.1. The SCRB and the KRG-GDRE! are responsible for preparing details o f final designs&#13;
for their respective components.&#13;
3 .      Scope of Annlysis. Analyses shall include an evaluation o f alternatives to the proposed Project,&#13;
including "no-action alternatives" and an examination o f the direct and indirect effects of the proposed&#13;
action. It shall also include an Environmental and Social Management Plan (EMP) that provides a&#13;
proposed framework for mitigation, monitoring, and institutional strengthening actions to be integrated&#13;
into the design and implementation o f the Project. As part o f this process, it i s planned that public&#13;
consultation will be undertaken and that environmental studies be disclosed to the public.&#13;
4.       World Bank Emironniental and Social Safeguards Policies. Tenns o f Reference have been&#13;
prepared to support the preparation o f the ESAs that i s in compliance with the environmental and social&#13;
policies and procedures o f the World Bank. World Bank Safeguard Policies involve mechanisms for&#13;
integration of environmental and social issues into decision-malung and are complemented by a Policy on&#13;
Disclosure o f Operational Information. World Bank Safeguard Policies encompasses two main types o f&#13;
policies namely, environmental and social. Environmental policies include Environmental Assessment,&#13;
Natural Habitats,Forestry, Pest Management, Safety of Dams, and Projects involvinginternational&#13;
Waters, while social policies include Indigenous People, Cultural Property, Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement,andProjectsin DisputedAreas.&#13;

B. OVERVIEW OF APPLICAEiLE WOKLD BANK SOCIAL Sr ENVIRONAIENTAL SAFEGUm&#13;
    POLICES AND RELATEDREQUIREMENTS&#13;
5.      Preliminary review o f the proposed ERRP indicates that two World Bank Environmental Policies&#13;
might be triggered.&#13;
        OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment. Category "A" environmental assessments are required,&#13;
        since the project may be associated with diverse and significant environmental and social impacts&#13;
        during the construction and operation phases. The environmental assessments should include an&#13;
        analysis o f the potential positive and negative physical, biological, socio-economic, and cultural&#13;
        property impacts from the proposed ERRP. It should identify and evaluate direct, indirect and&#13;
         cumulative impacts from the proposed Project in the zone o f influence to be defined by the&#13;
         Consultant and may extend beyond the areas o f bridge replacements. Under current World Bank&#13;
        procedures, all environmental assessments for Category "A" projects require that the studies be&#13;
        prepared by an independent consultant that has no conflict o f interest resulting from having been&#13;
        the lead consultant andor member o f a consortium or joint venture responsible for undertahng&#13;
         the feasibility and design studies for the proposed project.&#13;
6.       Inaddition, another World Bank policy or consideration that is necessary in a project of this&#13;
scope include:&#13;
&#13;
         BP 17.50 - Disclosure of Operational Information. The proposed ERRP is subject to the&#13;
         provisions o f this policy and other related World Bank requirements concerning the disclosure of&#13;
         environmental and social information.          These requirements include making ESAs and their&#13;
         supporting studies available in draft and final versions at the World Bank, Washington, DC, and&#13;
         with involved governmental authorities within Iraq (for instance, the SCRB inBaghdad, and the&#13;
         KRG-GDRBinErbil). Key documents should be made available inbothArabic and English.&#13;
&#13;

described indetail below:&#13;
         -   Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan; and&#13;
         - EnvironmentalManagementPlan.&#13;
Task 9. Resettleineat a i d Larid Acqiiisitioit Policy Framework aiid Plait&#13;
48.      While no resettlement and land acquisition are expected, if OD 4.12 i s triggered, the Consultant&#13;
shall develop a project-specific Resettlement and Land Acquisition Policy Framework, as well as a&#13;
Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan (RLAP). This Policy Framework will provide a detailed review&#13;
of the potential need for involuntary resettlement and the general approach, procedures and general&#13;
principles o f compensation for residents, relocations, Compensation for the involuntary acquisition of&#13;
land, compensation for temporary disruption, compensation for damage to crops, and compensation&#13;
and/or costs for removal and replacement o f plantings. The RLAP shall also provide detailed involuntary&#13;
resettlement cost estimates (including entitlements o f different categories o f affected people) that need to&#13;

Tusk 10. Environinental Mmngement Plnrt&#13;
50.      The consultant shall prepare an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to identify: (a) the&#13;
mitigation measures that address the identifiedpotentially adverse impacts, (b) the monitoring program&#13;
that verifies compliance with the recommended mitigation measures and that monitors for unanticipated&#13;
impacts that might arise, and (c) the institutional structure, strengthening and training required to&#13;
implement the mitigationand monitoringplans.&#13;
&#13;
Task 10.1.Emiiro~inientnlMitigation P h i&#13;
5 1.     The primary adverse environmental impacts that are expected with the construction and operation&#13;
phases can be eliminated or minimized by careful planning and staging o f construction activities, the&#13;
adoption o f proper management practices during operation, and relying on effective environmental&#13;
monitoring and training to support management decisions. The consultant shall devise a mitigation plan&#13;
to propose several potential impact-mitigation or control measures that shall earn the project more&#13;
acceptability, by reducing or eliminating to the extent possible the expected impacts that were outlined&#13;
above. Mitigation measures are intended to reduce the effect o f potentially significant impacts on the&#13;
environment. Thus, they are highly dependent on the significance o f the predictedimpact, the nature o f&#13;
the impact (permanent vs. temporary), or the phase o fthe project (construction vs. operation).&#13;
52.      For each negative environmental and social impact (during both the construction and operation&#13;
phases), the consultant shall identify and describe (wherever applicable):&#13;
         -   Correspondingprotectionmeasures to mitigate or offset damaging impacts from project&#13;
             activities;&#13;
         -   Costs and benefits for each reconmended mitigation measure developed to resolve a&#13;
             significant environmental issue;&#13;
         -   Appropriateness and cost effectiveness o f mitigation measures;&#13;
         -   Technology used in each mitigation measure: including informationregarding its prior&#13;
             effective use, the range o f environmental conditions under which it i s effective, and the level&#13;
             of skills required to operate and maintainthe technology;&#13;
         -   Time schedule for implementation o f each mitigation measure, showing that it will be inuse&#13;
             before the project impacts are felt;&#13;
         -   Intervention location(s) for each o f the proposed mitigation measures (on an appropriately&#13;
             scaled map);&#13;
         -   Concernedparties responsible for implementing the mitigation measures and the required&#13;
             personnel; and&#13;
         -   Definingcompensation to affected parties for impacts which cannot be mitigated.&#13;
 Task I0.2. Environntental Monitoring Plan&#13;
53.      The development and implementation of a continuous, long-term monitoring plan i s a crucial step&#13;
towards ensuring the sustainability o f bridge replacements, road improvements, and associated&#13;
infrastructure within the surrounding environment. Establishing a database that will be continuously&#13;
updated will provide a clear indication o f potential environmental degradation that will allow remedial&#13;
action at an early stage thus limiting irreversible damage. The consultant shall develop monitoring plans&#13;
within ESA reports. The monitoring plans should be implemented at the construction phase and be&#13;
maintained at least five years after completion o f construction activities, and preferably, throughout the&#13;
life of the project. The main objectives o f the monitoring plan are to: (a) monitor the perforniance o f the&#13;
bridges, roads, and associated infrastnicture, and the effectiveness o f mitigation measures; (b) identify the&#13;
extent of the environmental and social impacts predicted in the ESA on sensitive receivers; (c) determine&#13;
project compliance with regulatory requirements; and (d) recommend further mitigation measures if&#13;
found to be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     -71  -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54.     Monitoring indicators o f water and sediment quality, river flow, air quality, noise and vibration&#13;
levels, vehicle and boat traffic, biodiversity, landscape, waste management practices, resource use, health&#13;
and safety, and socio-economics shall be proposedby the consultant. For certain indicators, sampling and&#13;
chemical analysis are necessary in order to assess the extent o f the impact, while other indicators require&#13;
visual inspections and photographic documentation by experienced and specialized personnel. As such,&#13;
indicators to be monitored, monitoring locations, analysis methods, equipment required, frequencies, field&#13;
procedures, responsibilities, implementing parties, as well as relevant standards and budgetary&#13;
requirements shall be definedby the consultant. Monitoring locations shall be illustrated on detailed scale&#13;
maps.&#13;
Task IO.3. Institutional Strengthening-CapacityBuilding Measures&#13;
55.      The consultant shall review the authority and capability o f institutions at local, provincial,&#13;
regional, and national levels and recommend steps to strengthen or expand them so that the management&#13;
and monitoring plans in ESAs can be iinplemented. Recommendations may include the preparation o f&#13;
new laws and regulations, new agency fhctions, inter-sectoral arrangements, management procedures&#13;
and training, staffing, operation and maintenance training, budgeting, and financial support.&#13;
56.      Appropriate environmental management, in the context o f the proposed project, dictates that&#13;
construction and operation be implemented in accordance to the current state of the art and knowledge&#13;
regarding environmental protection. This can be accomplished by hiring competent personnel with the&#13;
appropriate educational and professional background and instituting periodic and systematic training&#13;
programs with site-specific plans that are adequate for protecting the general public and the environment&#13;
contributing to the mitigation o f potential environmental impacts as well as raising environmental&#13;
awareness among contractors and operators.            For this purpose, the consultant shall develop an&#13;
environmental training course whereby personnel who will be involved inthe construction and operation&#13;
o f the various components o f the proposed project will be required to attend prior to the initiation of&#13;
project activities. Similarly, personnel involved in monitoring activities during both construction and&#13;
operation shall attend similar courses / workshops to ensure their ability to implement the monitoring&#13;
plan.&#13;

Appendix 8.3: Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and&#13;
                  Compensation&#13;
1.      Objectives. Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum,and will be carried out&#13;
in accordance with these guidelines. Subproject proposals that will require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefdly reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through&#13;
alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights o f way should be&#13;
carefully reviewed, and no land or asset acquisition may take place outside o f these guidelines. A format&#13;
for a Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet i s attached as Attachment 3(i).&#13;
2.       These guidelines provide principles and instnictions to compensate negatively affected persons to&#13;
ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income eaming or&#13;
production capacity to pre-project levels regardless of their land tenure status.&#13;
3.       Categorization. Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the ERRP, Project&#13;
Affected People (PAPS)and the magnitude o f impacts, projects will be categorized as follows:&#13;
         (a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition andor physical&#13;
             relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. If the RAP&#13;
             cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver can be provided by the World Bank&#13;
             Managing Director in consultation with the Resettlement Committee. In such cases, the&#13;
             Project Team (or Task Team) should agree with the Borrower on a timetable for preparation&#13;
             o f the RAP.&#13;
         (b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require the following documentation: (i)a land&#13;
             acquisition assessment; (ii)minutes or record o f consultations which assess the compensation&#13;
             claimed and agreement reached; and (iii)a record o f the receipt of the conipensation, or&#13;
             voluintaiy donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
         (c) Proposed sub-projects are not expected to require land acquisition or cause significant&#13;
             adverse social impacts. It i s likely that significant positive social impact and improved&#13;
             livelihoods can be expected from the interventions.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Eligibility. PAPSare identified as persons whose livelihood is directly affected by the project&#13;
due to acquisition o f the land owned or used by them. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation include&#13;
those:&#13;
         (a) who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structureshuildings, including&#13;
             recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
         (b) who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufnict rights rooted in&#13;
             customary law; and&#13;
         (c) whose claim to land and water resources or buildinglstnictures do not fall within (i) (ii)and&#13;
             above, are eligible to resettlement assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation. PAPs are eligible for replacement costs&#13;
for lost assets as describedbelow:&#13;
         (a) Voluntary corztribtitioits.   Individuals may elect to voiuntarily contribute land or assets&#13;
             provided the persons making such contributions do so willingly and are informed that they&#13;
             have the right to refiise such contributions; and&#13;
         (b) Coiztribirtioizs agciiirst compeizsntioiz. A contributorlasset loser considered "affected" will be&#13;
             eligible for compensation and other necessary assistance.&#13;
6.       Voluntary contribution should be clearly documented to confirm the voluntary nature o f the&#13;
transition. The documentation should specify that the land i s free of any squatters, encroachers or other&#13;
claims. A format i s shown in Appendix 8.3(i), which includes a schedule for assessing compensations&#13;
claimed and agreements reached.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
7.      Compensation Principles. The project implementation agencies will ensure timely provision of&#13;
the following means of conipensation to affected peoples:&#13;
        (a) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets with&#13;
            the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at a replacement&#13;
            cost for that portion o f land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost assets will be&#13;
            made according to the following principles:&#13;
                 (i)replacementlandwithanequallyproductiveplot,cashorotherequivalentproductive&#13;
                      assets;&#13;

                 (iii)replacement o f damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
                 (iv) other acceptable in-kindcompensation;&#13;
                 (v) incase o f cash compensation, the delivery o f compensation should be made inpublic,&#13;
                      i.e., at the Community Meeting; and&#13;
                 (vi) in case o f physical relocation, provision of civic infrastructure at the resettlement&#13;
                      sites.&#13;
         (b) Project affectedpeoples losingaccess to a portion o f their land or other economic assets&#13;

view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious&#13;
significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes cemeteries, graveyards and graves.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited risks o f&#13;
damaging cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community&#13;
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction o f existing structures, and minor public&#13;
works.   Further, the list o f negative subproject attributes, which will make a subproject ineligible for&#13;
support includes any activity that will adversely impact cultural property. Nevertheless, the following&#13;
procedures for identification, protectioii from theft, and treatment of discovered artifacts should be&#13;
followed and included instandard biddingdocuments as provided.&#13;
&#13;
Chance FindProcedures&#13;
-.&#13;

         (c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable&#13;
             antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local&#13;
             authorities and the Ministry o f Culture take over;&#13;
         (d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who inturn will notify the responsible local authorities and&#13;
             the Ministry o f Culture immediately (within24 hours or less);&#13;
         (e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry o f Culture will be in charge o f protecting and&#13;
             preserving the site before deciding o n subsequent appropriate procedures. This will require a&#13;
             preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists o f the Ministry o f&#13;
             Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance o f the findings should be assessed&#13;
             according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the aesthetic,&#13;
             historic, scientific or research; social and economic values;&#13;
         (f) Decisions o n how t o handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities and the&#13;
             Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when finding an&#13;
             irremovable remain o f cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,&#13;
             restoration and salvage;&#13;
         (8) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management o f the finding shall be&#13;
             communicated inwriting by the Ministry o f Culture; and&#13;
         (h) Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible local&#13;
             authorities and the Ministry o f Culture concerning safeguard of the heritage.&#13;
&#13;
4.       These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. Duringproject supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor the above regulations relating to&#13;
the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
 5.      Relevant findings will be recorded in W o r l d Bank Project Supervision Reports, and the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report will assess the overall effectiveness of the project's cultural property&#13;
mitigation, management, and activities, as appropriate.&#13;

            Iraq - Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Road
            Rehabilitation Project for Iraq is to improve the condition
            of road assets by rehabilitating highly damaged segments of
            the country's highway and rural road networks,
            reestablishing critical river crossings, and restoring the
            capacity to manage and maintain road assets. Part A (US$90.0
            million) will provide financing to the central and southern
            Governorates to rehabilitate about 300 km o f highways,
            reconstruct some 150 km of village access roads, replace
            about three floating bridges with permanent structures, and
            establish a road asset management system. Part B (US$45.0
            million) will provide financing to the three northern
            Governorates to rehabilitate the main road from Erbil to
            Altun Kopri (38.5 km), reconstruct around 75 km of village
            access roads, and establish a road asset management system.
