                               I.BACKGROUNDANDSTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.        AfghanistaninTransition&#13;
&#13;
1,        Afghanistan, ravagedby chronic conflict andpolitical instability for the last two decades,&#13;
i s on a surer but still slow path ofreconstruction. Despite limitedstate infrastructure,&#13;
Afghanistan InterimAdministration and its successors, the Transitional Islamic State of&#13;
Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan (IRA), have managed to restore basic&#13;
government, reverse the humanitariandisaster, prepare a National Development Framework,&#13;
adopt a new constitution, and implement it through the national development budget. The Islamic&#13;
Republic of Afghanistan i s creating an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
2.        Although the scarcity of economic statistics makes it difficult to assessthe state of the&#13;
economy, indicators show strong signs of recovery, albeit from very low levels o f activity.&#13;
Followingeconomic growth of 30 percent in2002, preliminary estimates indicate that real GDP&#13;
growth remainedstrong above and 20 percent in2003. The economic recoveryreflects the endof&#13;
hostilities and i s drivenby sizable donor assistance, sound economic policies and the end of a&#13;
prolonged drought. The impact of economic recovery i s most visible inservices and&#13;
construction, which are expanding rapidly inurban centers. Agricultural production rose sharply,&#13;
benefitingfrom increasedrainfall and expandedacreageunder cultivation. GDP (excluding&#13;
opium production) reached around US$4.8 billion in2002 equivalent to around US$200 per&#13;
capita.&#13;
&#13;
3.        However, growing security threats, a large opiumdrugbusiness, and slower than&#13;
expectedprogress onreconstructionare all threatening to undermine these achievements.&#13;
&#13;
4.        The Government o f Afghanistan recentlyreleased areport, SecuringAfghanistan's&#13;
Future: Accomplishments and the StrategicPath Forward (March 17,2004). The report,&#13;
prepared incollaboration with the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund,&#13;
the UnitedNations DevelopmentProgram, the UnitedNations Assistance Missionfor                      !&#13;
Afghanistan and the World Bank, sets out a comprehensive framework for the country's&#13;
development. The report goes beyond economic andhumandevelopment issues such as health,&#13;
education, infrastructure and private sector development, and also, for the first time, integrates&#13;
issues relatedto security, justice, counter-narcotics efforts and humanrights. It estimates costs to&#13;
support a 12-year investmentprogram. The US$27 billion price tag includes programs designed&#13;
to address the needs of Afghanistan's citizens and help create opportunities for them which could&#13;
lift the country to aper capita annual incomeofabout US$500 over the next sevenyears. At this&#13;
level Afghanistan would still be a poor nation but anation whose citizens couldbegin to see a&#13;
hopeful path forward to improving their livelihoods. Significantly, over US$7.5 billion of the&#13;
total i s needed for security, a cost not integrated into earlier assessments, and without which&#13;
Afghanistan's future would remain compromisedand undermined by forces opposed to the&#13;
nation's progress.&#13;
&#13;
B.        Power Sector NeedsandPriorities&#13;
&#13;
5.        Afghanistan's power sector i s severely constrainingthe development of the country.&#13;
Officially, access to power i s only about 6%, one o f the lowest inthe world; only 234,000&#13;
customers are connected to the public grid, of which approximately 30% are inKabul. The other&#13;
provinces have even less access, with rural areas beingvirtually unserved. The existing power&#13;
network is ina dilapidatedstate and inurgent needo frehabilitation. The provision o f an&#13;
expanded andreliable electric power service i s thus critical for future economic growth, social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
equity, and the political unityo f the country. Unless this occurs, it will not be possible to meet&#13;
the country's development goals.&#13;
&#13;
6.        The existing facilities provide an unreliable service for only a few hours each day. There&#13;
i s about 450 MW installed capacity ingeneration facilities, o f which only 271 MW are available&#13;
and most o fthe units require overhaul or replacement. (Appendix Iprovides more details on the&#13;
sector.) Distribution systems inthe country are destroyed due to insufficient investment, lack o f&#13;
maintenance, and outright theft o f materials over the last 23 years. The substations and low&#13;
voltage distribution networks are dismantled and overloaded; very few components o f this system&#13;
could be used inthe future. Inaddition, an unknown number o f unofficial consumers are&#13;
connected to individual meter boxes inan extended web o fpoorly-wired secondary circuits. This&#13;
results invery low supply voltages and hightechnical losses, which are an economic loss to&#13;
Afghanistan and, if saved, could be used to supply other customers. The distributionnetworks in&#13;
the provincial cities suffer from similar drawbacks. A comprehensive redesign and&#13;
reconstruction exercise i s needed.&#13;
&#13;
7.        The existing country-wide power utility,D a Afghanistan BreshnaMoassese (DABM),&#13;
does not have an appropriate governance structure, nor does it have the economic resources to&#13;
improve the service. Inspite o fbeing defined as an autonomous company, DABMdepends on&#13;
budget resources o fthe Ministryo f Water and Power (untilFY 2003 the salaries o f the staff were&#13;
paidby the MWP budget) and i s overstaffed (almost 7,000 employees). Inaddition, most o f the&#13;
staff lack the technical qualifications to runa modem system, having been out o f touch with the&#13;
world for the last two decades.&#13;
&#13;
8.        The financial situation o f the DABMi s desperate. Revenues are limited due to the lack&#13;
o f efficient billing and collection systems. The billing and collection o f the company i s based on&#13;
the customers' own readings. Each customer takes his own meter readingto the bank and the&#13;
teller bills and collects the amount due. There i s little or no control or supervision o f such&#13;
readings and theft and non-payment are rampant. Technical and non-technical losses are high-&#13;
on the order of 30-40 percent - due to overloaded facilities and lack o f customer supervision.&#13;
With the exception o fcities, which are supplied with diesel generators, electricity tariffs are well&#13;
below the cost o f supply. (See para 19 for a discussion on tariff cost-recovery.)&#13;
&#13;
C.        Government Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
9.        As describedinthe Government's SY1382 and SY1383 National Development Budget,&#13;
the vision of MWPi s that by 2010, DABMwill "evolve into autonomous, financially viable&#13;
enterprises providing reliable, l o w cost electricity supply service to all Afghan citizens inan&#13;
environmentallyresponsible manner, consistent with sound business practices." T o achieve this,&#13;
the Government plans to expandrapidly the availability o f electric power inthe mainregional&#13;
areas o f the country and will needto (i)  invest heavily inrehabilitationof the existing system, (ii)&#13;
increase supply, inpart byrelyingmore on power imports; and (iii) the country's&#13;
                                                                         expand&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. A key economic and social objective i s&#13;
to increase the number o f new connections. Historical rates o f connections are an inadequate&#13;
guide to future needs. Currently, Govemment plans to create an additional 730,000 connections&#13;
by2010. This would result inan increase ofthe accessratio inurbanareas fkom the current&#13;
estimated 27% to 77% by 2010, and an increase inthe access ratio countrywide from the current&#13;
6% to almost 25% by the same date. By 2015, the urban accessratio is expected to be almost&#13;
90% and overall access 33 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.      Investment Priorities. An estimatedUS$2,785 million wouldhave to becommitted&#13;
duringthe 2004-2010 periodingeneration,transmission and distributionas well as incapacity&#13;
buildingto meetthe sector objectives targeted for 2015. Approximately 50% o fthis amount&#13;
would be needed for new generating capacities. Over the 2004-2006 period, an estimated&#13;
US$700 million would need to be disbursed, distributed almost evenly between generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution. Investmentinnew generating capacity would focus on a small&#13;
number of priorities such as:&#13;
&#13;
e        Rehabilitationo f existing hydro-plants and conversion o f gas turbines plant to combined&#13;
         cycle inKabul;&#13;
e        Import of electric power from Uzbelustan to supplement shortfalls indomestic generation&#13;
         capacities;&#13;
e        Construction o fnew combinedcycle capacity inSheberghanbasedonnatural gas;&#13;
e        Construction o f the Baghdara hydro-plant, possibly followed by Sarobi 2;&#13;
e        Construction o f the Kajakai 2 hydro-plant; and&#13;
e        Installationo f small diesel generatorsinvarious cities for which no alternatives to&#13;
         electricity are available.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Major investment intransmission capacity inthe northem provinces i s neededto enable&#13;
import of additional power from Uzbelustanto Kabul and other neighboring provinces. Inthe&#13;
western provinces, investment i s also neededintransmission capacity to enable import ofpower&#13;
from Iranand Turkmenistan to meet future demand inHerat. Buildingon this import strategy,&#13;
the government i s exploring how further to develop the sector ina regional context inorder to&#13;
facilitate power trading betweenneighboring countries.&#13;
&#13;
12.      An intensive investment programindistributionis critical to meet the new connection&#13;
goals. This investment would focus on the main urbanareas andrequire a well-coordinated&#13;
implementation effort. Inparticular, large crews o f qualified electricians would have to be&#13;
trained inan extensive and sustainedprograminorder to render possible the timely installation&#13;
and maintenance o f the enormous quantities of low voltage materialthat would be funded under&#13;
the investment program. The number of connections which MWP intendsto bringup to an&#13;
acceptable standard in2005 and 2006 would be about 150,000 ineachyear, with a further&#13;
100,000 connections ineachof the subsequentyears.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Fundingunderthe ongoingIDAEIRPproject, and fundingfrom KfW,the European&#13;
Union and the Asian DevelopmentBank (ADB) i s beingusedto beginthe work o frehabilitating&#13;
some o f the transmission and sub-transmission networks inKabul. The EIRP i s also funding&#13;
similar work inseveral of the provincial cities. These funds (about US$16 million equivalent) are&#13;
only sufficient to cany out partial emergency recovery works that were identifiedearly in2002.&#13;
&#13;
14.      A substantial amount ofadditional funding(about US$250million) isrequiredinthe next&#13;
four years for the reconstructionand expansion o f the networks, ifthey are to be brought upto a&#13;
reasonable standard, with acceptablelevels of losses and satisfactory consumer supplyvoltages.&#13;
The proposed project will provide these additional funds to finance the supply and erection of&#13;
materials, plant and equipment (including metering andIT) that are requiredto rehabilitate and&#13;
expand the city networks.&#13;
&#13;
15.      FinancingRequirements. Most ofthe estimatedUS$2,800 millionneeded for the 2004-&#13;
2010 period still has to be committed. Aggregate commitments of approximately US$380 million&#13;
have already been made for the 2004-2006 period (to be compared with investmentneeds of&#13;
approximately US$700 million) as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
e        ADB: US$90 million (primarily focused on transmission);&#13;
e        KfW: unofficial target i s EURlOmillion (US$12 million) per year for the coming years&#13;
         (primarily focused onKabul generation and distribution);&#13;
e        USAID: estimated US$80 million (primarily focused on generation rehab inthe South,&#13;
         East and power sector reform);&#13;
e        IDA:US$l05 million(primarily focused on distribution); and&#13;
e        Government of India: estimated US$70 million (missinglinktransmission line).&#13;
&#13;
16.      The un-financedportion o fthis critical three-year investment programi s approximately&#13;
US$325 million. As most of the financing requirements for 2004 have beenmet, the gap applies&#13;
mostly to investments for 2005 and 2006. (The Technical Annex for the Power Sector prepared&#13;
for the re-costingexercise titled Securing Afghanistan 's Future contains more details. See&#13;
www.af/ for more information.)&#13;
&#13;
17.      ImplementationStrategy. Weak implementationcapacity is the single largest&#13;
constraint to achieving the sector goals o ftriplingthe number of connections and securing&#13;
increasedreliability of supply by 2010. The Government implementationcapacity i s very limited&#13;
with an ageing under-paidand technically poor equippedlabor force. A keyelement ofthe&#13;
Government's implementation strategy i s to adopt a "program management approach" within the&#13;
Ministryin-charge ofPower, that wouldinvolve the following elements:&#13;
&#13;
e        Establishing strong ownership within the Ministry, which would be responsible for the&#13;
         design and implementation o f the investment program; and&#13;
e        Settingup a Project Implementation Support Unit(PISU) within the Ministry, staffed&#13;
         with internationalandnational consultants. Steps have been taken to have the PISUin&#13;
         place by JuneIJuly 2004.&#13;
&#13;
18.   ,  InstitutionalReform. Although the future industrystructure hasnot yetbeendecided, it&#13;
i s understoodthat the standardhorizontal unbundlingmodelmay not be appropriate for a system&#13;
that may consist of isolatedgrids for several years to come. The government's immediate focus&#13;
on the institutional side i s to improve DABM'sperformance inbilling and collection. All key&#13;
donors (i.e. ADB, Germany, USA, and IDA) are working actively with MWPto coordinate their&#13;
assistanceand to prevent overlap.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Thenext step is to corporatize DABMandrestructure it to operatewith a more&#13;
commercially and financially viable orientation. The govemment i s takmg steps to appoint a new&#13;
Board of Directors andManaging Director for DABM. Inaddition, it tentatively plans to&#13;
establish four vertically integrated Business Unitsreflectingthe current andmediumterm&#13;
regional grid structures plus another unitto cover off-grid access as follows:&#13;
&#13;
e        Breshna East (covering Kabul, Nangarhar, Logar, Ghami, Paktia and Khost provinces);&#13;
e        Breshna North (covering Balkh, Faryab, Jowzjan, Saripul, Samangan, Kunduz, and&#13;
         Baghlanprovinces);&#13;
e        Breshna South(covering Kandahar, Helmand and Zabol provinces);&#13;
e        Breshna West (covering Heart, Baghdis and Faryab provinces); and&#13;
e        Off-Grid Access Unit (rural, urbanand peri-urban areas not covered by the four regional&#13;
         businessunits). This unitwill likely remain inthe Ministryof Water and Power for the&#13;
         immediate future and eventually a separateRural Electrification Authority may be&#13;
         formed with small, isolated electrified urbancenters beingrunby localmunicipal&#13;
         authorities, cooperatives, NGOsandprivate investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.       Eachregional Business Unit will operate on a commercial basis with separate accounts&#13;
and with its own tariff structure relevant to its source o f supply (hydro, diesel, and/or imports).&#13;
The groundwork to prepare these units to be spunoff as independent companies will be initiated&#13;
immediately, startingwith Breshna East which covers Kabul. However, it may take some time&#13;
for the government to identify new management teams and Boards o f Directors for eachunit&#13;
which would be required before they can be legally operated as separate corporations. Once each&#13;
o f the regional unitsare spun off, DABMwould be left to operate the highvoltage transmission&#13;
system which interconnects the regional companies, handle power trading with neighboring&#13;
countries, and ensure sufficient supply for the nationalpower system.&#13;
&#13;
21.       Private sector management may be contracted for one or several units down the line&#13;
under a performance-based contracts. However, any private sector participation(PSP) would not&#13;
be possible under the current situation, given the DABM's poor organisational systems related to&#13;
its personnel data, its accounting systems, technical information, billing and collection, and the&#13;
current level o frisks inAfghanistan. Preparatory work i s required to create the basic information&#13;
and support before any private participation scheme can be attempted. Inaddition, any private&#13;
participation that involves even limited financial risk i s likely to be constrained by current&#13;
perceptions o f security andpolitical risks.&#13;
&#13;
22.       Cost Recovery andPricingReform. Although data i s scarce and unreliable, it i s&#13;
estimated that the average tariff inAfghanistan i s approximately US$ 3.7 per kwh;however,&#13;
there i s no uniform national tariff and it varies widely depending on the source o fpower. In&#13;
Kabul (and other hydro-based systems such as Kandahar), the average tariff i s about US$2.0 per&#13;
kwh. Incitieswith importedpower anddiesel generator, such as Mazar-e Sharif, Kunduzand&#13;
Herat, average tariffs are US$ 5.2 per kwh,US$ 5.9 per kwh, andUS$ 9.1 per kwh,&#13;
respectively. The overall average cost o f supply i s estimated at US$ 7.0 per kwh, implyingcost&#13;
recovery o fjust over 50 percent.&#13;
&#13;
23.       The calculation o f the full cost recovery o f hydro-based electricity distributed inKabul&#13;
(even if seemingly fully depreciated) i s a priority on the political agenda. The minimum&#13;
objective i s to raise electricity tariffs to a level inline with energy carriers competing inthe&#13;
heatingsector (e.g., fuel wood, LPG, other liquidfuels). However, government shouldbe careful&#13;
to avoid pricing those that depend on electricity for heating out o f the market and into alternatives&#13;
which are either highlypollutingor have adverse environmentalimplications. Ifproper pricing o f&#13;
electricity i s neglected, no investment program would be able to cope with the load increase&#13;
fuelled by under-pricedand/or non-paid-for electricity. The Government has shown willingness&#13;
to raise tariffs by doubling them duringwinter over the last two years. However, defining a tariff&#13;
path to full cost recovery levels will need to be inline with improvements inthe quality o f&#13;
service. The Ministry o f Water and Power will retain a public relations advisor as part o f this&#13;
project who will assist them indeveloping a PR campaign, including stakeholder consultation in&#13;
order to buildconsumer consensus on service delivery and tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                       11. IDA'S RESPONSE&#13;
&#13;
A.       Bank Support and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
24.      The WorldBank Boardapproved a Transitional Strategy Support (TSS) for Afghanistan&#13;
inMarch2003, whichwas designedto beinplace for 18months to two years. Thisrepresented&#13;
the expected timeframe required for Afghanistan to develop anew Constitution and a stable&#13;
representative government under the new constitutional arrangements, inline with the process&#13;
mandatedby the Bonn Agreement. The Government's NationalDevelopmentFramework&#13;
provides the basis for the TSS. Withinthis Framework, it was agreedthat the Bankwill focus on&#13;
four broad areas:&#13;
&#13;
e        ImprovingLivelihoods: employment generation, community development, and the rural&#13;
         economy includingwater resourcesmanagement.&#13;
0        FiscalStrategy, Institutions, and Management:budget,role o fMinistry of Finance,&#13;
         revenue and expenditure arrangements, and central-local fiscal framework.&#13;
e        GovernanceandPublic Administration Reform:role of state, financial transparency,&#13;
         good governance of public administration, and civil service reform.&#13;
0        EnablingPrivate Sector Development:business climate, financial sector,&#13;
         infrastructure, regulation, trade, and reducingbureaucratic `red-tape' constraints.&#13;
&#13;
25.      The proposed Emergency Power Rehabilitation Projectwill support activities that are&#13;
designedto enableprivate sector development through the rehabilitation andexpansion ofpower&#13;
infrastructureinKabul andprovincial cities.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
26.      The project provides aresponseto Government's goal of rehabilitating and expanding the&#13;
power infrastructureinthe maincities o f the country, and for improving the operation o f DABM&#13;
inasustainablemanner. Theprojectis expectedto improve distributionnetworksinKabuland&#13;
the mainprovincial cities, rehabilitate the NaghluHydro Power Station locatedapproximately 50&#13;
miles east of Kabul and its corresponding transmission line, and support the commercialization of&#13;
DABM.&#13;
&#13;
27.      The Government hasrequestedthe Bankto take the leadrole inthe reformdialogue,&#13;
whichthe project will underpin, and is inline with the TSS for Afghanistan. The World Bank&#13;
acts as the focal point for the consultative group for energy, miningand telecommunications and&#13;
plays a leadrole indonor coordination andpower sector dialogue with the government, including&#13;
drafting the power technical annex for "Securing Afghanistan's Future".&#13;
&#13;
28.      There are four key donors assisting the Ministry o f Water and Power: Asian&#13;
DevelopmentBank (ADB), International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA), Germany (through&#13;
KfWandGTZ),andthe US (through USAID). Inaddition, Iranhas financed transmission lines&#13;
to interconnect the city o fHerat, and India i s expected to finance the detaileddesign and&#13;
constructionfor the critical transmission linkbetween Pul-e Khumriand Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from OngoingProjects&#13;
&#13;
29.     Underthe Emergency InfrastructureReconstruction Project, protracteddelays inthe&#13;
delivery of goods have been experienced. These have been for various reasons, including (a)&#13;
weak capacity inthe line ministry, (b) lack of arobust responsefrombidders, (c) problems with&#13;
technical specifications, (d) insufficient staffing inthe central procurement unit, (e) delays in&#13;
setting up letters of credit and the associatedspecial commitmentwhich i s requiredby the&#13;
correspondent bank for DAB for every letter of credit issued, and (0delays inKarachi customs.&#13;
Many of these issues have been addressedor arebeingaddressedby Govemment; however,&#13;
unacceptable delays for the emergency nature of the project are still occurring. The following are&#13;
some of the recommendations beingincorporated into the proposed project's design:&#13;
&#13;
9       Creating a the Program Implementation Support Unitto buildcapacity inthe ministry&#13;
        andwhich would assume responsibility for technical specifications, bidevaluations, etc.&#13;
        The PISUis not expected to be operational beforeJuly 2004, andtherefore, MWP will&#13;
        needto work closely with the ARDS P Uuntilthis time to ensure the procurement process&#13;
        moves smoothly.&#13;
&#13;
9       Designinglarger tender packagesinorder to have less contracts overall. Processing and&#13;
        managing 30 or more goods contracts under the power component o f EIRP severely&#13;
        taxed the capacity o f boththe govemment ProcurementUnit andMW.&#13;
&#13;
9       UsingIntemationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB) procedures as opposed to Intemational&#13;
        Shopping which (i)    provides for wider advertising and competition, and (ii)  avoids&#13;
        havingto split the packagesinto smaller lots (see point above).&#13;
&#13;
9       Usinga supply and erect contract for large-scale rehabilitation work, as opposedto&#13;
        separate and multiple contracts for goods and erection to ensure coordination andtimely&#13;
        installation of materials.&#13;
&#13;
P       Movingthe location of the Special Account ii-omthe Central Bank to one o f the newly&#13;
        opened commercial banks inKabul (i.e. StandardChartered, National Bank o f Pakstan&#13;
        and Habib Bank) to improve the turnaround time for letters of credit. A more general&#13;
        lesson is to address the issue o f commercialbanking ability inthe country at the outset of&#13;
        the reconstructioneffort.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Separategoods contracts are not envisaged under this project, as rehabilitation&#13;
components will be implementedunder integrated supply and erect contracts. However, to the&#13;
extent that separate goods contracts will needto be considered for future projects inAfghanistan&#13;
or inanother post conflict situation, especially where the country i s land-lockedand commercial&#13;
banlungi s not well established, the following additional recommendations may be applicable:&#13;
&#13;
9       Establishingan office inKarachi (one of the mainports of entry) to facilitate the&#13;
        clearance of goods intransit to Kabul to address one of the key bottlenecks inthe&#13;
        delivery o f goods. It i s understood that the Ministryof Commerce usedto have such an&#13;
        office inthe consulate inKarachi, andthe Govemment may wishto reinstate this to&#13;
        improve implementationof govemment and donor implementedprojects inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
9       Changingterms to DDU(delivered duty unpaid) as opposed to CIE'. DDUputs the onus&#13;
        on the supplier to insure the goods untilthey are deliveredto the buyer's premises.&#13;
        Therefore, it will be the supplier's responsibility to claim on insurance incase of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         damaged goods, for which the MWP has little capacity. DDUterms also specify that the&#13;
         supplier i s responsible for delivering the goods to the site statedinthe contract document&#13;
         (Kabul, say) and for transiting the goods through another country. Itneeds to be&#13;
         recognizedthat bidders will include intheir bids the cost o f these extra responsibilities.&#13;
         Government may wish to consider, whether such extra costs are worth investing in,inan&#13;
         attempt to avoid the risksmentionedabove.&#13;
&#13;
P        Modifying standard payment terms to encourage suppliers to accelerate delivery o f&#13;
         goods. This could includeback-loadingthe payment terms. For instance, the advance&#13;
         payment could be for 50% (against an irrevocable bank guarantee), with 50% on&#13;
         acceptance o f the goods. This method has been usedunder the water supply component&#13;
         o f EIRPwith some success where suppliers have forgone letters o f credit. Another&#13;
         method mightbe to advance 20-30% (against an irrevocable bank guarantee), 30% on&#13;
         shipment and 40-50% on delivery, instead of the more typical advance of lo%, with 80%&#13;
         on shipment and 10%on delivery.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A. ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
31,      The broad objective o f the Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project i s to provide an&#13;
improved and more reliable power supply to the people inKabul. Improvements inthe other&#13;
main provincial cities' o f the country will depend on the availability o f cofinancing.&#13;
&#13;
32.      This objective would be achievedby (i)      rehabilitating and enhancing the existing&#13;
dilapidatedgeneration, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and (ii)        developingthe&#13;
institutional capacity o f the M W P and DABMto initiate improved commercial operations.&#13;
&#13;
B. ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
33.      The project aims to improve supplies o f electricity to Kabul and other cities through the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion o f distribution networks, rehabilitation o f the largest generation&#13;
station supplyingKabul and the associated transmission line, commercialization o f the operations&#13;
o f the power utility inKabul, and capacity building for ministryand utility staff. The project&#13;
consists o f eight components as shown inthe Table 1below. Eachcomponent also includes the&#13;
project number from the Afghanistan Donor Assistance Database that shows it has been approved&#13;
as part o f the Afghanistan national budget for SY1383.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' Provincialcities to be covered under the project through cofinancing include Kunduz, Mazar-e Sharif,&#13;
BaghlanPule-khumri, Sheberghan, Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, Lashkargahand Griskh. These are the&#13;
cities which are connected to a transmission grid. Distributionrehabilitation and expansion incities which&#13;
are provided electricity through diesel generators and isolated networks is identifiedas a separate project&#13;
underthe Afghanistan Development Budget.&#13;
&#13;

34.     Cost Estimates. The cost estimated for components (a) and (b) are basedon calculations&#13;
performedby the Bank team usingmaterial costing from the ongoing Emergency Infrastructure&#13;
Reconstruction Project. The actual quantity ofmaterials and work relatedto network&#13;
rehabilitation and expansions for about 200,000 service improvements inKabul, etc. will be&#13;
revisedbythe design and supervision consultants, inaccordance with the funds available, and&#13;
basedon the data, which was gathered inKabul inMarch and April 2004 by a small team of&#13;
internationally recruited consultants. Cost estimates for components (c) and (d) will be updated&#13;
when the work to prepare the biddingdocuments hasbeen completed, again by internationally&#13;
recruited consultants, inthe secondquarter of calendar year 2004.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Cofinancing. At the Govemment's request, the project hasbeen designed for&#13;
cofinancing to capitalize on IDA'Sappraisal and project implementationreview capacity. The&#13;
cofinancing element has been structured around the distribution component, as it easiest to&#13;
incorporate and to expanddecrease depending on the amount of cofinancingmobilized. IDA&#13;
funds will beusedfor the Kabul area, andadditional cities will be addedas cofinancingbecomes&#13;
available to ensure regionalbalance. IDAunderstands that cofinancing for this component i s one&#13;
of the keypriorities for the Ministryo f Finance and financing fiom Gulf States i s beingsought.&#13;
Inaddition, 50percentco-financingisrequiredfortherehabilitationofthe100MWNaghlu&#13;
hydropower station for which the AbuDhabiFundhas expressedinterest infunding. Inthe&#13;
unlikely event that joint financing for Naghlui s not mobilized intime, the additional $15 million&#13;
required will bereallocated fiom other components.&#13;

36.      A descriptiono fthe projectbycomponent is providedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
(a)      RehabilitationandExpansionofDistributionNetworksinKabul(US%72 million)&#13;
&#13;
37.      The IDA-financed component will consist o f a supply and erection contract to rehabilitate&#13;
and extend the sub-transmission networks inKabul. The inadequate service wires, which have&#13;
been erectedhaphazardly and without metering, will be replaced with appropriately sized&#13;
conductors and meters for some 200,000 consumers. The contractor will be responsible for mine-&#13;
related risks including clearance ifrequired, incoordination with the UNMine Action Center&#13;
(MACA) and inaccordancewith IDAproceduresfor MineRiskManagement(Attachment 5 of&#13;
the Environment and Social Safeguard Framework inAppendix VQ.&#13;
&#13;
(b)      RehabilitationandExpansionofDistributionNetworksinOther ProvincialCities&#13;
(US%94 million)&#13;
&#13;
38.      This component will consist o f supply anderection contract(s), to rehabilitateandextend&#13;
the sub-transmission networks inthe provincial cities o f Kunduz, Mazar-e Sharif, BaghladPule-&#13;
khumri,Sheberghan, Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, LashkargahandGriskh and, for a targeted&#13;
200,000 consumers inthose cities, the provisiono f appropriate services wires andmeters, when&#13;
funding becomes available. As indicatedabove, the contractor will be responsible for mine-&#13;
related risks.&#13;
&#13;
(c)      Rehabilitationof Naghluhydro power station(US$30 million)&#13;
&#13;
39.      Naghluhydroelectric plant was constructed under USSR Techno-Economic Assistance in&#13;
1967 on the Kabul Rver, at the Naghlusite (about 50 miles east o f Kabul). Ithas four Francis-&#13;
type vertical turbines with a total capacity o f 100MW, the largest single plant inAfghanistan.&#13;
Due to deterioration andnon-availability o f spare parts, and lack o f servicing, the plant may stop&#13;
production at any time. With funds from the ongoing Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction&#13;
project, MWP has recentlyprocured, from the original plant manufacturer, the most urgently&#13;
required spares and replacement parts for Naghlu, at a cost o f US$ 1.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
40.      This component ofthe proposed projectwill consist o f a supply and erectioncontract,&#13;
which will be let following an ICB exercise. The objective will be to extensivelyrefurbishthe&#13;
mechanical and electromechanical equipment (turbine, generator), the hydro-mechanical&#13;
equipment (valves), and the control, regulation, and protection equipment. As indicated above,&#13;
the contractor will be responsible for mine-related risks.&#13;

41,      The power generated at Naghlui s conveyed to Kabul through a double circuit 1lOkV&#13;
transmission line to the East Substation (approximately 54.4 kilometers), and a single circuit 110&#13;
kV transmission line (circuit 143) connects East Substation to North Substation (approximately&#13;
27 lulometers). The lines are presentlyincommission, butthey have beenrepairedperfunctorily&#13;
many times inthe past. The quality o fthe repairs means that the lines are subject to frequent&#13;
faults, and often, extensive outages. This component will consist of a supply and erect contract to&#13;
restoringthese lines and replacing or repairing several o f the damaged towers. As indicated&#13;
above, the contractor will be responsible for mine-related risks.&#13;

objective of the PR campaign i s to disseminate the Government's vision, strategy andreform&#13;
program for the power sector to all stakeholders, undertake stakeholder consultation, and build&#13;
support for the reformprogram among those stakeholders. This PR campaign will also be critical&#13;
to informthe public about the benefitsto them o frationalizing the existingunofficial&#13;
connections, which will be replaced with proper connections and individual meters. The PR&#13;
campaign, by undertaking stakeholder consultation and educating the general public and the&#13;
consumers, will helpreduce opposition to these improvements, which are likely to come from&#13;
various parties, who have vested interests inthe status quo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Government has decided to eventually standardise the sub-transmission voltage at 20 kV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  11&#13;

&#13;
A.       DetailedImplementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
47.      The Ministryof Water and Power (MWP) will have overall responsibility for project&#13;
execution and implementation. However, it i s recognized that M W P has a weak implementation&#13;
capacity, and lacks qualified people as a result of the twenty-five years o f conflict when people&#13;
either fled the country or didnot have access to higher education. Many o f the sector's staff are&#13;
close to retirement, and because o f the conditions prevailing for the last twenty-five years, most&#13;
have been unable to remain current with modem methods o f management, engineering design,&#13;
and contract supervision.&#13;
&#13;
48.      Therefore, MWP i s inthe process o fretaining the services o f a firmto provide a team of&#13;
technical staff, who will form the core o f its ProgramImplementation Support Unit(PISU). The&#13;
overall goal o f the PISU team i s to accelerate implementationo f Afghanistan's power sector&#13;
development program. The team will consist of four resident professionals, who will variously&#13;
take the initiative and manage inthe areas o f project preparation; procurement, consultant and&#13;
contractor supervision; and information technology and training (see chart below). Inaddition,&#13;
the firm will provide short term specialists who may be required from time to time to deal with&#13;
environmental protection, social science, gas turbine and combined cycle plant, hydro-electric&#13;
plant, transmission line construction, geology, hydrology, etc.&#13;

systems, implementationof the project sub-components i s not expected to involve any significant&#13;
adverse environmental or social impacts. No specific assets (or land) are expectedto be acquired&#13;
for this Project. Specifically:&#13;
&#13;
0        The rehabilitation and expansion ofthe distributionnetwork inthe cities will involve the&#13;
         erection o f distribution lines, and consumer service lines. The location o f transformers&#13;
         and sub-stations will be either on at the location of the original substation or alongside&#13;
         existingroads, side streets or lanes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
73.       The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed on the basis o f an&#13;
overall Framework for World Bank-funded reconstruction operations which was prepared in&#13;
consultation with the principal NGOs and development partners participating inreconstruction&#13;
activities inAfghanistan. Prior to approval o fthe project by the World Bank Board, it will be&#13;
disclosed by IRA inbothDari and Pashto, as well as English,and it will also be made available at&#13;
the World Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
E.        MonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
74.       Monitoringarrangements include plans for intensive supervision by IDA to ensure that&#13;
any implementation difficulties are dealt with promptly. The to-be-created PISUwill also have&#13;
functional responsibility for monitoring and evaluation on behalf o f the client. As mentioned&#13;
previously, the PISU will also be responsible for preparingquarterly progress reports. The&#13;
selected performance indicators for the project are outlined inAppendix VIII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     V. BENEFITSAND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
A.        ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
75.       Given the very poor state o f the power sector -both interms o f the extent and quality o f&#13;
service, and the physical condition of the assets -investments for rehabilitating and upgradingthe&#13;
utilities' infrastructure or for expanding electricity supplies will entail large benefits for the&#13;
economy. Inparticular, investments to upgrade the asset base are expected to have short pay-&#13;
back periods, and yield high(economic and financial) returns. Improvements inthe quality o f&#13;
supply and greater access to electricity are also expected to yield substantial benefits. Benefits&#13;
will be attained both through a reductioninthe cost o f energy (relative to what most consumers&#13;
are currently paying) for households and an improvement inelectricity supply for productive&#13;
activities (industry, commercial, etc), thereby supporting the Government's growth and poverty&#13;
reduction objectives.&#13;
&#13;
76.       The economic analysis o f the Project i s based on incremental electricity sales to the&#13;
400,000 additional customers the Government aims to connect over the next four years as defined&#13;
inthe Power Sector ReformRoadmap(Appendix 11)andfinanced underthisProject. The value&#13;
o f the increased sales i s taken as a measure o f the benefits of the Project. The value of electricity&#13;
was derived from the cost o f alternate energy sources which consumers are currently using, and&#13;
therefore i s used as a proxy for consumers' willingness-to-pay price for electricity. (It i s noted&#13;
that a willingness-to-pay survey was not feasible to undertake given the emergency nature o f the&#13;
project.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77.      The investment program for the power sector (for FY 2004-2007) i s taken as the&#13;
economic cost of the Project. The investment programi s fundedentirely by donors, andthere are&#13;
no taxes on importedmachinery, equipment, or works contracts. The investment estimates can&#13;
therefore be considered as "border price equivalent", and no further adjustment i s required for&#13;
convertingthem to economic costs. Since benefits are definedas "the value of additional&#13;
electricity sales duringFYs 2004-2007", the entire investment program for the power sector (as&#13;
opposedto only the distribution investments -which account for the bulko f the program to be&#13;
financed by IDA) has to be considered as the cost of the Project. Ifgeneration andtransmission&#13;
costs were not included, the true economic cost of additional electricity suppliedwould be&#13;
understatedsince the incremental sales/supplieswill not be possible without them. The full&#13;
investmentprogram for the power sector - amounting to about US$ 920 million -i s therefore&#13;
taken as the economic cost o f the Project. Assuming a 10% discount rate, the economic rate of&#13;
retumfor the Project i s 23%, which i s considerably higherthan the current cost of capital for the&#13;
Afghan economy. (See Appendix VI1for more details on the Economic Analysis.)&#13;
&#13;
B.       Likely Risks&#13;
&#13;
78.      Therisks to achieving the sector goals arehighand canbe split into those that cannot be&#13;
mitigated(political, security) and those that can (implementation, cofinancing, etc.). A&#13;
deterioration o f the security situation or a reversal inthe political process will limit the ability of&#13;
the Govemment to implement the reconstructionprogram and to deliver services throughout the&#13;
country, which intum will create the ground for increasedinsecurity. Project risks include the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
79.      Reversal in thepoliticalprocess set out in the December 2001 Bonn accord or a&#13;
deterioration of the security situation inthe country are other major riskfactors whichmay&#13;
negatively impact the project and discourage bothcontractors and foreign consultants to&#13;
participate inthe project. The recent successful conclusion of the Constitutional Loya Jirga in&#13;
January 2004 has somewhat reducedpolitical risks; however, the coming elections present a&#13;
significant source of uncertainty. On the security side, progress has beenless steady, with&#13;
deterioration inthe last several months. MWP and the project can do little to mitigate this risk.&#13;
&#13;
80.      Lack of Incremental Power Supply. MWP plans to buildthe 220 kV double circuit line&#13;
from Hairatan to Kabul, so that it can be commissioned in2007. This will provide 150 MW of&#13;
imported power to Kabul from Uzbekistan. Ifthe commissioning of the line i s delayed it will&#13;
negatively impact the project outcomes, as there will notbe sufficient capacity to supply the&#13;
additional customers envisaged to be connected under the project. The critical nature of this issue&#13;
i s well known to the Minister o f Finance and Ministry of Water and Power who are closely&#13;
monitoring the situation. However, the project will initially focus onreplacingthe inferior wiring&#13;
connecting most customers to the networks, which will dramatically reduce the losses; but&#13;
conversely it will enable consumers to increasetheir demands on the gridfor greater supplies of&#13;
electricity.&#13;
&#13;
81.       Weak implementation capacity of the executing agency to implement the project i s one of&#13;
the major risks facing the project and requires a fundamental change inapproach. However, the&#13;
MWP with the support o f the donors has committed to creating a ProgramImplementation&#13;
Support Unitwithin the Ministry, which would beresponsible for the implementationof donor-&#13;
fundedprojects and wouldbe staffedwithadequately trained engineersandother specialists. The&#13;
PISUi s expected to be operational by June/July 2004 and would helpmitigate this risk. In&#13;
addition, the project has been designed to minimize the implementation complexity for MWP (i.e.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
smallnumber of integrated supply and erect contracts) with an oversight consultant for the largest&#13;
component.&#13;
&#13;
82.      Co-financing needs to be identifiedpromptly ifthe project i s to meet its objectives of&#13;
rehabilitatingand expanding the systems inthe cities other than Kabul andrehabilitating the&#13;
Naghlupower plant. Ifthe full $100 million of cofinancing for components (b) and         (0is not&#13;
mobilized, the project scope interms of number of cities will needto bereduced. The design and&#13;
supervision consultant will beresponsible to prepare detailed designs for all the cities, described&#13;
inthe project scope, so that once financingis available, procurement canproceedimmediately.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Customer dissatisfaction could also pose a risk, as the project will have an effect on their&#13;
electricity bills, not only for the necessarytariff increase, but also the change of the meters and&#13;
properreading andbilling. Inaddition, breaking the culture ofnon-payment will require&#13;
significant government resolve. The distribution component will break the current connection&#13;
arrangement with unofficial consumers and provide them with individual meters and standard&#13;
connections. This may antagonize certain vested interests who gain financially from the current&#13;
set-up. Thisriskwill bemitigatedby the execution of a public awarenesscampaign along with&#13;
stakeholder consultations, andby improving the quality o f the service.&#13;
&#13;
84.     Land Mines and Unexploded Ordinances (UXOs). Afghanistan i s one of the most&#13;
heavily minedcountries inthe world. The need for mine action surveys and possible clearance&#13;
has proven to be a cause o f delay inrehabilitation and reconstructionof infrastructure projects in&#13;
the country, typically incases where the cost for such service i s not included inthe cost o fproject&#13;
implementation. Thisrisk will be mitigatedunder the projectby having the supply and erect&#13;
contractors responsible for subcontracting these services through UNM A C A and its associated&#13;
de-miningNGOs. The SafeguardFramework (see Appendix VI) also contains clear guidelines&#13;
for mine action activities under Bankprojects.&#13;
&#13;
85.      Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements. Procurement and financial&#13;
management would be the responsibility of the new MWPProgram Implementation Support&#13;
Unit, with assistance from the A R D S Procurement Agent and the MOF FinancialManagement&#13;
Agent. Specific measureshave beenundertaken as a result of the lessonsthat have beenlearned&#13;
under the ongoing Emergency Infrastructure ReconstructionProject to avoid numerous contracts&#13;
for individual goods that are cumbersome to manage.&#13;

FaizabadMicroHydelstation. This plant wasbuilton the JouzenRiverwith Indiantechnical&#13;
and economicalco-operation in 1984, having 3 x 0.085 MW turbines. The plant was constructed&#13;
to provide electricity to Faizabad town. All the three turbines are now non-functional, due to lack&#13;
of spare parts. The government of India and the supplier Jyoti are prepared to provide parts. The&#13;
plant would require about US$400,000 for rehabilitation. It i s proposed that three machines&#13;
(0.085 MW), bereplaced by machines with a capacity of 0.25 MW each. Work began in2000&#13;
withthe helpof aUkranianfirm.&#13;

1985 by ABB (now Alstom) at Khair Khana with a capacity of 45 MW. The plant has two&#13;
turbines o f21.8 and 23.2 MW respectively. On full load eachturbine consumes 9000 l/hrof&#13;
diesel. Mucho fthe combined cycle unit has been supplied, but becauseo f war, contractor, ABB,&#13;
didnot remainon site to complete installation. Itis likely that the cost to complete the plant&#13;
would be about US$ 15 million. The combined cycle capacity i s 28.6 MW.&#13;

   Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan&#13;
        MinistryofWater andPower&#13;
&#13;
            Electricity Sector Policy&#13;
&#13;
                 August 2003&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.       Policy Vision&#13;
&#13;
Electricity i s a vital service inthe economy; it i s an input inthe production o f nearly all other&#13;
goods and services, and it i s also an important final good, consumed by households. The&#13;
TransitionalIslamic Government o f Afghanistan recognizes that the electric sector i s essential to&#13;
achieve the nation's reconstructionand development goals. Electricity i s the backbone o f the&#13;
economic recovery and availability o f reliablepower will help stimulate economic growth, raise&#13;
living standards andrestore the traditional sense o f community and common purpose that unites&#13;
the Afghan people. A reliable power systemi s essential to providing basic services, inattracting&#13;
new industries, retaining existing ones, and bringingback to the country those that have left.&#13;
&#13;
Today, only 4-6 % o f the country's population has electricity, and among those 4-6%, the&#13;
availability i s unreliable. Many o f the country's residents and businesses rely on diesel&#13;
generators placed on their premises. Afghanistanhas the lowest per capita consumption o f&#13;
electricity inthe world. After 23 years o f armed conflict that destroyed the country's electrical&#13;
infrastructure, the total consumption o f electricity has declined from 554 GWhper year in 1980 to&#13;
394,000 GWhin2000, reducingthe consumption by a third o f what it i s today. Similarly on the&#13;
generation side, even though the country's nameplate capacity remains at 454 MW, the actual&#13;
productioni s around 240 MW, due to the damage and lack o f maintenance o f the generation&#13;
plants.&#13;
&#13;
The vision o f the Ministryo f Water and Power (MWP)is:&#13;
&#13;
         By 2010, to evolve into autonomous,Jinancially viable enterprisesproviding&#13;
         reliable, low cost electric sewice to all Afghan citizens in an environmentally&#13;
         responsible manner, consistent with sound businesspractices&#13;
&#13;
To accomplish the above vision, the M W P has planned, over the next few years, ambitious&#13;
projects with the goals o frehabilitating its existing infrastructure, increasing its generation&#13;
capacity through the participation o f the private sector, steadily increasingthe number o f&#13;
customers it serves, establishing more appropriate tariffs, and increasingits revenue through&#13;
enhanced and effective billing and collection and loss reduction procedures. The MWP also&#13;
recognizes the pressing needto develop institutional capacity and tools that would allow itto&#13;
effectively manage the reconstructionefforts o fthe electric infrastructure. The purpose and&#13;
objectives o f this policy i s to provide the organizational structure and the legal andregulatory&#13;
framework which would allow the MWP to accomplish its vision, while at the same time&#13;
transformingthe power sector into a commercially viable and stable sector that attracts and&#13;
retains private investors.&#13;
&#13;
The Government supports the liberalization o f the electricity sector, through a combination o f&#13;
competition and regulations, as market forces. The government, where possible, will encourage&#13;
thejoint use o f its physical electric infrastructure to provide other services. Where joint use i s&#13;
possible, the MWP intends to competitively price the cost o fproviding and managingthese&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
To encourage and attract private sector involvement, and to provide for the safety o f customers&#13;
and environmental stewardship, the government will develop a regulatory framework and will&#13;
introduce law that would create an independent electricity regulatory entity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.      Role of the Government&#13;
&#13;
The Government's chief objective, as articulated and ledby the MWP,i s to set the overall vision&#13;
for the electricity sector, to create the organizational structure which would allow the transparent&#13;
execution o f all its policies and vision, and to enable the environment for private investment,&#13;
competition and rapid industrygrowth. The Government itself will no longer be the operator o f&#13;
the electric sector. The MWP would continue to have the sole responsibility for sector policy,&#13;
specifically including the drafting o f legislationand the development o f international competitive&#13;
tenders for private sector participation. More specifically, the MWP role would be to:&#13;
&#13;
e       Provide overall direction for electricity sector development and formulate broadpolicies&#13;
        and regulations for the benefit o f all o f Afghanistan that i s consistent with other national&#13;
        development plans and laws;&#13;
e       Initiate the establishment o f an independent electric regulatory entity;&#13;
e       Promote private sector participation and investment inthe electricity sector;&#13;
e       Encourage the expansion o f access to underserved andrural communities;&#13;
e       Stimulate the rationaluse o f new and renewable sources o f energy; and&#13;
e       Represent the government o f Afghanistan inelectricity matters pertaining to regional&#13;
        interconnections and international organizations.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Restructuringof the Electricity Sector&#13;
&#13;
The sector would be restructured by (i)     separating the utility functions (generation, transmission&#13;
and distributiodsale o f electricity) from sector policy andplanning functions; (ii)    strengthening&#13;
the role o f MWP inpreparingand implementing sector policies, coordinating donor programs,&#13;
and improving governance inthe sector; (iii)     establishing an independent regulatory entity, which&#13;
would set technical, financial and operational performance standards and regulate the power&#13;
sector; and (iv) developing feasible options for handling certainnon-core functions which are&#13;
currently being handledby MWPor by government enterprises controlled by MWP.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.    T h e M W P&#13;
&#13;
The MWP comprises nine (9) departments and has de facto responsibility for four (4) public&#13;
enterprises. These enterprises are:&#13;
&#13;
e       D a Afghanistan Breshna Mosssesa (DABM),which i s responsible for the operation &amp;&#13;
        maintenance for generation, transmission &amp; distribution, and sales o f electricity.&#13;
e       New &amp; Renewable Research and Development Center, which i s responsible for the&#13;
        research and introductiono f devices that use new andrenewable sources (solar, wind,&#13;
        biomass, micro hydros).&#13;
e        Spinghar ConstructionUnit, which i s responsible for the civil works for substations,&#13;
        power stations, and other facilities.&#13;
e       Power ConstructionUnit,which i s responsible for the erectiono fpower stations&#13;
        equipment, transmission and distribution lines, and substations.&#13;
&#13;
The role o f MWP will be redefinedto cover (i) preparation and execution o f sector policy and&#13;
                                                    the&#13;
planning; (ii) preparationo f the legal framework for the electricity sector (incoordinationwith&#13;
other Ministries); and (iii) coordinationo f donor programs and activities. MWP will no longer be&#13;
responsible for the day-to-day management and operation o f the public enterprises. MWPwill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
seek expert services and advice for strengthening its policy makingrole, as well as for enhancing&#13;
staff capabilities through training and other institutional development programs.&#13;
&#13;
3.2.     DABM&#13;
&#13;
DABMisresponsiblefor the generation, transmission, distributionofelectricity, operation and&#13;
maintenance o f assets, sales o f electricity, andrevenue collection. As a first step to separate these&#13;
utilityfunctions fromMWP,anew Boardo fDirectorswill be constituted. ThisBoardwould&#13;
include representative(s) o f the Ministryo f Finance, which i s the owner o f the enterprises, the&#13;
MWP, and other relevant stakeholders, and will ensure that the public enterpriseswill operate in&#13;
accordance with commercial principles.&#13;
&#13;
3.3.     Other Enterprises&#13;
&#13;
Presently MWP (and/or DABM) also perform some activities which are normally performedby&#13;
the private sector, and can be acquired on a competitive basis by the electricity sector entities.&#13;
These include Power ConstructionUnit, Spinghar Construction Unit,a Pole Manufacturing Plant,&#13;
Water and Power Electricity Consultants Authority (WAPECA), and the N e w &amp; Renewable&#13;
Research and Development Center       - which handles researchandpilot programs for promoting&#13;
new andrenewable sources. The Government intends to (ultimately) divest these functions to the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Creation of an Electric Regulatory Entity&#13;
&#13;
Today, no legal and regulatory fkamework exists inAfghanistan. Tariffs settings, one o f the basic&#13;
functions o f a regulatory agency, are done at the MWP. There i s no provision for private&#13;
participation inthe power sector.&#13;
&#13;
The government intends to create a legal andregulatory framework by establishing an electric&#13;
regulatory entity. This regulatory fkamework would: (i)     establish a licensing/ authorization&#13;
process that would regulate and attract private investments; (ii)  create and design electricity&#13;
tariffs, and (iii)&#13;
                 create a process that would ensure consumer safety, protection, and&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
&#13;
The scope of the regulatory entity duties will include, but shall not be limited to the following:&#13;
&#13;
e        Implement the national policy for the power sector that ensures a fair, transparent and&#13;
         competitive market environment according to international best practices;&#13;
         Providejust and reasonablerates and charges for electricity services and promote&#13;
         conservation o f energy;&#13;
         Create an enabling environment for competition andprivate sector participation;&#13;
         Ensure adequate, reliable, and economical utility service;&#13;
         Ensure least cost planning;&#13;
         Encourage and promote harmony between utility companies and their customers;&#13;
         Set technical standards regarding interconnection betweenutility companies to ensure&#13;
         open access on a fair and non-discriminatory basis; and&#13;
e        Ensure consumer protection, safety, and environmental stewardship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.       Implementation&#13;
&#13;
To implement this policy, the government will:&#13;
&#13;
e        Develop an updated electricity law (last revisedin 1984) to allow for, among other&#13;
         things, private sector participationinthe sector;&#13;
0        Create a Program Support Unitto ensure the accountable execution o f the reconstruction&#13;
         efforts and act as the main implementationinterface for donor-fundedprojects;&#13;
0        Appoint a Technical Advisory Board to advise the MinistedDeputy Minister when&#13;
         necessary; to advise the MinistedDeputy Minister when necessary; and&#13;
e        Establisha high-level ReformTask Force to lead the sector restructuringprocess.&#13;
&#13;
The ReformTask Force, chairedby the Deputy Minister for Power and reporting to the Minister&#13;
for Water and Power, would be establishedinMWP. It will engage consultants/experts to: (i)&#13;
advise on, prepare, and implement the restructuring o f DABMinto independent entities&#13;
responsible for the generation, transmission and distributiodsale o f electricity; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                     conduct public&#13;
relations and information campaigns to develop support for the restructuring and reformprogram&#13;
among employees, consumers, and other stakeholders; and (iii)   prepare policies and&#13;
recommendations for enhancing the commercialviability o f the new companies/entities.&#13;
&#13;
The Task Force will also identify the legal and other constraints (ifany) which preclude the&#13;
divestiture o fnon-core functions to private owners/operators, ascertain whether any staff o f these&#13;
entities can or should be accommodated within the MWP or DABM, and develop suitable social&#13;
programs (early retirement, training, outplacement, etc) for handling the remaining staff o f these&#13;
entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

transmission line from Naghluto Kabul. Most contracts will be procuredthrough ICB&#13;
procedures usingthe Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD) for Supply and Installation o f&#13;
Plant and Equipment. Whilst efforts will be made to avoid it, Direct Contractingmay be required&#13;
inthe case o fproprietaryequipment for the rehabilitation andrepairat the Naghluhydro power&#13;
station.&#13;
&#13;
Selectionof Consultants: The project will require services o fbothfirms and individuals. Major&#13;
consultants services through firms would include (i)   technical support for design o f distribution&#13;
networks and supervision o f installationinKabul, (ii)   technical support for design o f distribution&#13;
networks and supervision o f installationinthe provincial cities (non-Bank financed), (iii)&#13;
technical support for commercializationo f the DABM, and (iv) public relations campaign.&#13;
Individuals' services would be required for technical assistance to the MWP and DABM.&#13;
Consulting firms will be recruitedprimarily under the Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Assessmentofthe Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement&#13;
&#13;
Procurement activities will be carried out by the Ministryo f Water and Power (MWP). An&#13;
assessment o f the capacity o f the Mwp to implementprocurement actions for the project has&#13;
been carried out by the Bank. The assessment reviewedthe individual as well as the&#13;
organizational aspects pertaining to procurementresponsibilities under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
MWPnever hadaproperProcurementdepartment. Procurement underthe nationalbudgetare&#13;
processed through MWP's Administration department. MWP's Planning department previously&#13;
hadresponsibility for procurement under the development budget. Followingthe creation o f a&#13;
centralprocurement unit within the government, currently locatedwithin the Afghanistan&#13;
ReconstructionDevelopment Services (ARDS), procurement under the development budget i s&#13;
being carried out with the assistance o f the A R D S Procurement Unit and its consultant, Crown&#13;
Agents. Inthe last two decades o f severe conflict andpolitical instability, there were only limited&#13;
activities pertainingto procurement inthe Ministry, and the procurement staff were not exposed&#13;
to any internationalprocurement practices. Four MWP staff have participatedinthe procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
training course arrangedby the Crown Agents during the last few months. However, only three&#13;
remain inthe employ of MWP and are involved inminor procurement involving shopping&#13;
methods, apparently ina fairly unstructured fashion. Apart from weak procurement skills, the&#13;
procurement staff also lack capacity to communicate inEnglish language.&#13;
&#13;
Based onthe above information, and the overall public procurement environment inthe country,&#13;
the overall procurement risk for the project i s considered as "High".&#13;
&#13;
Actions agreed to mitigate the risks involved:&#13;
&#13;
e        The PISUconsultants team will include anintemationalprocurement consultant to assist&#13;
         the Ministryinexecuting procurement activities underdonor fundedProjects. The&#13;
        MWP procurement staff should be brought under the supervision of this procurement&#13;
         consultant, which would provide opportunities to all procurement staff to get on-the-job&#13;
        training and exposure to intemational procurement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
e       Untilsuchtime that the PISUis operational (expectedinlateJune/early July), all&#13;
         procurement under the Project would be carried out with the assistance o f the Central&#13;
         Procurement Consultant; i.e. the CrownAgents, within the ARDS PU.&#13;
&#13;
e        The procurement staffwill take part infuturetraining courses onprocurement, arranged&#13;
         under the govemment' s initiative for procurement capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
A Procurement Plan for project implementationwas developed duringappraisal whichprovides&#13;
the basisfor the procurement methods. Thisplanhasbeen agreedbetween the Borrower andthe&#13;
Project Team and i s provided inthe Table A o f Attachment 2 below. The Procurement Plan will&#13;
beupdatedinagreementwith the ProjectTeam annually or as requiredto reflect the actual&#13;
project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity. Table B o f the&#13;
Attachment 2 provides the format for procurement monitoring andreporting.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
Inadditionto thepriorreview supervision to becarried out byBankprocurementspecialists, itis&#13;
recommendedthat at least two field visits are carriedout annually to conduct post review o f&#13;
procurement actions giventhe weak capacity assessment of the implementing agency.&#13;

 APPENDIXV: FINANCIALMANAGEMENT&amp; DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
The WorldBank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial&#13;
management issues inAfghanistan from implementing several projects over the past 18 months.&#13;
The overall assessment i s that though the country's financial management system i s not fully&#13;
functional, appropriate mitigation measures, general and project specific, are being taken for this&#13;
project inorder to ensure fiduciary financial accountability for project funds. Inan effort to&#13;
strengthen key institutions, the World Bank i s financing a Financial Management Agent to assist&#13;
the Ministry o f Finance and an Audit Agent to assist the Control and Audit Office and an&#13;
Procurement Agent to assist inProcurementrelated activities, and the USAID and Indian Aid&#13;
Assistance Programme i s financing a team o f consultants/advisors to assist the D a Afghanistan&#13;
Bank inlocal as well as foreign currency operations.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The commitment of the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan (IRA) towards accountability and&#13;
transparency inits operations i s one o f the greatest strength, as itprovides confidence to IDA&#13;
management o f ensuring accountability and transparency inutilization o f funds. The institutional&#13;
mitigation measures referredto above reflect this commitment and will help inproper accounting&#13;
and auditing o f financial transactions. Itmay be further emphasizedthat through the engagement&#13;
o f the FinancialManagementAgent, the Government is now ina position to ensure proper&#13;
accounting for local payments. The Government has also put inplace additional mechanisms&#13;
such as (i) the Special Disbursement Unit(SDU) under the Treasury for disbursements and&#13;
maintenance o f Afghanistan Management Information System (AFMIS), (ii)          Development&#13;
Budget and External Relations (DBER)Unitunder the Budget for overall management and&#13;
reporting o f all donor projects, and (iii)the Cash Management Unit,to undertake accounting for&#13;
all income and manage cash resources, under the overall charge o fthe Treasury Department o f&#13;
the Ministryo f Finance. By engaging the services o f an international firm o f auditors to assist the&#13;
Country's Auditor General, IRA i s able to further satisfy the international donor community&#13;
regardingthe audit.&#13;
&#13;
The project specific measures include the mobilization o f a CCFO (Chief Financial Officer)&#13;
retained under the ARTF-financed Strengthening Financial Capacity project to support Ministry&#13;
o f Water and Power (MWP). The CCFO would be incorporated inthe Program Implementation&#13;
Support Unit (PISU) within MWPwhich i s being createdto strengthen the line ministry's&#13;
capacity to manage its reconstructioddevelopment program, including donor-financed projects.&#13;
MWPwouldberesponsible for appointingcounterpart stafffor the PISU. Thisincludes&#13;
identifying a counterpart manager for each of the functional areas, including financial&#13;
management, who would be "twinned" with the expatriate lead advisors inorder to ensure&#13;
capacity is built within the ministry. The availability o f the Financial Management Agent; the&#13;
government's commitment to transparent and accountable financial management; and the&#13;
appointment o f a CCFO to MWP; and the setting up o f PISU for assisting MWP with project&#13;
implementation and supervision, are the primary strengths o f the project's financial management&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
As i s typical for all projectsinAfghanistan, this project i s affectedby weaknesses inthe Afghan&#13;
institutions and systems for financial management, reporting, auditing, and banlung; and severe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
shortage of experienced and trained in-country finance professionals incentral agencies, such as&#13;
MOF, as well as inthe MWP.&#13;
&#13;
Fromthe perspective o f financial management, the main weakness inthe design of the project i s&#13;
non-involvement o f financial management (FM) capacities at the MWPlevel. One reason is that&#13;
FMsystem at the MWPis stillnot gearedto manageforeign grants andto deal withthe donor&#13;
agencies. However the creation of the PISU,appointment of a CCFO and counterpart manager&#13;
and staff will address this risk. It will be important for the CCFO to not only work with the PISU&#13;
butalso with the accounting/finance department inMWP to exposethemto international&#13;
financial management arrangements.It i s expectedthat by end o f the CCFO term, adequateFM&#13;
capacity would have beenbuildinMWP.&#13;
&#13;
Co-financing&#13;
&#13;
At the Government's request,the projecthasbeendesignedfor approximately50 percent co&#13;
financing to capitalize on IDA'Sappraisal and project implementationreview capacity. The co&#13;
financing element has beenstructured around the distribution component as it easiestto&#13;
incorporate and to expanddecrease depending on the amount o f co financing mobilized. IDA&#13;
funds willbeusedfor the Kabularea, andadditional cities will beaddedas co financingbecomes&#13;
available to ensure regional balance. IDA will finance the design and supervision consultant who&#13;
will beresponsible for detailed design of all cities underthe project and supervision of erection&#13;
works inKabul. As co financing becomes available for other cities, the supervision responsibility&#13;
of the consultant will be expanded. Inaddition, 50 percent cofinancing i s beingsought for the&#13;
rehabilitationofNaghluHydro Power Plant component. IDA understands that co financing for&#13;
thisproject is one ofthe keypriorities for the Ministry ofFinance andthat Gulf Statefinancing&#13;
has been tentatively identified.&#13;
&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
Project funds will be deposited inthe Special Account (SA) to be opened and maintainedat the&#13;
Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) or ina local commercial bank. Capacity interms o f delivery o f&#13;
service and charges for the services will have to be assessedby the Government (MOF) and&#13;
arrangements formalized before movingfrom the existing practice o fplacing this account inDa&#13;
Afghanistan Bank (DAB).The SA, inkeepingwith current practices for other projects in&#13;
Afghanistan, will be operatedby the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) inthe Treasury&#13;
Department of Ministryof Finance. Requests for payments out o f SA funds will be made to the&#13;
SDUbythe MWP.Inaddition to payments out of SA funds, MWP couldalsorequestthe SDUto&#13;
make direct payments to contractors and consultants, and special commitments for contracts&#13;
covered by letters of credit. Suchrequestswill follow the World Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
All projectpayments are expected to bemadeto either internationalfirms or local firms, which&#13;
have bank accounts ineither DAB,a local commercial bank or an overseas bank. Inaddition to&#13;
payments out of the SA funds, for highvalue payments, MWP could also request the SDUto&#13;
request the Bank to make direct payments to contractors and consultants, or to issue special&#13;
commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Bank account details o f contractors will&#13;
have to be obtained at the time o f finalization o f contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
At IRA'Srequest, the project will retroactively finance works, goods, consultants' services and&#13;
training for MWP o f US$5 million (5 percent o f total IDA credit amount ) for expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
incurred inaccordance withBank's procurement procedures after M a y 31,2004 up to the Credit&#13;
signingdate. The claimwould be admissible for any project component.&#13;
&#13;
MWPwillmaintainaproper accounting systemofall expendituresincurredinthe abovemanner&#13;
along with all the supporting documents for enabling IDA to verify these expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
As the MWP does not have adequate capacity for financial management, it has been agreed that a&#13;
full-time CCFO financed under the ARTF fundingand counterpart manager and staff will be in&#13;
place to oversee financial management aspects o f the project. The CCFO will work closely with&#13;
the staff inthe PISU, SDU and DBERinMOF, and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
Current practice inMWP i s governmental recording o f transactions based on a chart o f accounts,&#13;
usinga single entry, manually maintained, cashbasis o f accounting. MWP receives its&#13;
operational budget allotments on quarterly basis from MOF. MWPhas two major category o f&#13;
expenditures: payrolls andprocurements, mainly consumables. Uponpreparationand approval o f&#13;
necessary supporting documentation, MWP prepares a payment order (Form M16) and sends to&#13;
the Treasury Department inMOF which inturn issues a check after verification o f supporting&#13;
documents and approvals on the form. A committee consisting o f three members, named Cash&#13;
Trustee, receives the money from the bank, and disburses the monies to the intendedpayees. For&#13;
procurement expenditures, after receiving the money from the bank, all three trustee members&#13;
carry the cash physically to the market andpurchase the requesteditems. The accounting&#13;
department enters these transactions inan expenditures book (Form M20), and prepares a&#13;
monthly expenditures report on form M220.&#13;
&#13;
The Project also will follow standard government financial management policies and procedures,&#13;
including the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management Agent to record Project&#13;
expenditures. Inaddition, the CCFO will assist the PISU inMWP to record financial transactions&#13;
o f the project inan electronic format, usingsimple spread sheet andor database applications.&#13;
Suchrecording o f data should enable the PISU inM W P to retrieve financial information for&#13;
producing the FinancialMonitoringReports (FMR) informats to be agreed with the World Bank.&#13;
The use o f these procedures will allow for adequate recording andreporting of Project&#13;
expenditures. PISU will have simple andbrief financial guidelines on its FMresponsibilities&#13;
which will be done inclose conjunction with CCFO and counter part manager.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Currently the FMRs are prepared centrally in SDU inTreasury Department with DBER&#13;
(Development Budget and External Relations Department) beingresponsible for consolidating&#13;
the reports for Donors. These FMRs are beingproducedbased on records kept on Excel spread&#13;
sheets. The first set o f FMRs have beenproduced for ongoing projects inthe portfolio. A review&#13;
o f the FMRsreveals that SDU currently i s not ina position to provide the necessary information&#13;
relating to component-wise expenditure as well as correct category-wise breakdown as this&#13;
detailedknowledge lies with the implementing agencies. Inaddition, the SDU i s overstretched in&#13;
terms o f staffing to producemeaningful FMRs. Based on the FMarrangements envisaged inthis&#13;
project, the PISUwill be responsible for producingFMRs which will have adequate data, staff,&#13;
and systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i) and uses o f funds&#13;
                                                                           sources&#13;
by disbursement category and project component; (ii)physical progress; and (iii) o f        status&#13;
procurement activities. These will be submitted by the PISU in MWP to the DBER in MOF for&#13;
consolidation and IDA within 45 days o f the end o f the quarter. The government and IDA are&#13;
currently working on a proforma format for all Bank projects, and a final format will be agreed as&#13;
part o f project negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
Annual project accounts will be consolidated centrally inthe Ministry o f Finance, inparticular,&#13;
the Treasury Department, supported by the FinancialManagement Agent, and consolidated&#13;
Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f Project funds.&#13;
&#13;
FMRswill be prepared at PISUinMWP based on data itmaintains, and annual financial&#13;
statements will be prepared by the SDU at MoF, based on accounting it undertakes. To overcome&#13;
possibilitieso f variations between the two sets o f data independently maintained, a regular&#13;
reconciliation process on a monthly basis will be undertaken by PISUto avoid major variations&#13;
between FMRs and annual financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
The use o fthese procedures will allow for adequate recording andreporting o f Project&#13;
expenditures.&#13;

&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
The existing contract o f the FM, Audit and Procurement agent are finishing inAugust 2004. To&#13;
ensure fiduciary financial accountability for project funds it i s necessary that adequate and timely&#13;
arrangements are inplace and issues relating to transition are well addressed. The three agents are&#13;
being funded under World Bank EmergencyPublic Administration project which has been&#13;
extensively reviewed and assessedrecently, and subsequent discussions have been carried out&#13;
with the Governmentbothduringthe IDAPortfolio Review inFebruary 2004 and separately. Itis&#13;
expected that the recommendationswill be finalized soon and then acted uponintime.&#13;
&#13;
At one time DaAfghanistan Bankwas one o fthe weak points inthe chain o f foreign payments,&#13;
however with the support o f Indianadvisers on operation o f SWIFT and Letter o f Credits, this&#13;
area has improved. Alternatives for placing the SA ina commercial bank are being discussed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
any such change should be on the basis o f a briefassessment o f the service delivery capacity and&#13;
a formal MOUwith the commercial bank.&#13;
&#13;
Lack o f FMexpertise o f acceptable level inthe line ministries i s still a matter o f concern. It i s&#13;
expected that with the appointment of a CCFO to coordinate with PISU and MOF and nomination&#13;
o f FMstaff by the MWP, these risks will also be minimized to a large extent.&#13;
&#13;
With the above risks identified, the project appears to be highrisk; however, ifthe above&#13;
mitigating measures are taken the risk would be reduced to medium. A regular and effective&#13;
supervision o f the project, inparticular the role o f CCFO, PISUand o f SDU will further reduce&#13;
thisrisk.&#13;

&#13;
Financing Percentage. Since collection o ftax revenue hasjust begun and i s sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentages have been set at 100%with the understanding, however, that MOF will&#13;
submit withdrawal applications on anet-of-tax basis. The tax structure o fthe government will be&#13;
reviewed periodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages&#13;
needto be amended and financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA credit would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with&#13;
fulldocumentation or against statements ofexpenditures as appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
Useof statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made onthe basis o f SOEs for:&#13;
(i) contracts for goods and works costing less than USD 250,000 equivalent; (ii)       contracts for&#13;
individual consultants costing less than U S D 50,000 equivalent; (iii)  contracts for consultant&#13;
firms costing less than USD 100,000 equivalent; and (iv) all training.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactivefinance. Provision has been made to reimburse the Govemment o f Afghanistan for&#13;
payments it makes, up to U S D 5 million (SDR 3.5 million) for eligible project expenditures after&#13;
M a y 31,2004 up to credit signing. No disbursement shall be made until IDA has satisfied itself&#13;
that adequate supporting documentation i s available and Bank's procurement procedures have&#13;
been followed for expenses claimed under the retroactive financing provision.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account. A Special Account will be opened and maintained inD a Afghanistan Bank or a&#13;
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association; and would be operated&#13;
bythe Treasury DepartmentinMOF inaccordance with the Association's operational policies.&#13;
Allpaymentrequests for withdrawals to be made fi-om the Special Account will be initiatedby&#13;
the MWP. The Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account would be set not to exceed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
USD8,000,000. The initial advance will be limited to USD 4,000,000. Once cumulative&#13;
disbursements have reachedthe SDR equivalent o f USD 16,000,000, the remainingU S D&#13;
4,000,000 may be advanced to the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
Minimum Application Size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) at least monthly, regardless o f amount, or (2) when the Special Account balance i s&#13;
reduced by 40%, whichever comes first. The minimumapplication size for withdrawal&#13;
applications for reimbursement, direct payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is&#13;
10%ofthe Authorized Allocation o fthe Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
Authority to withdraw Creditfunds. MOF will retainthe rightto sign and submit withdrawal&#13;
applications to the Association, based on the requests receivedfrom the MWP.&#13;

    APPENDIX VI: ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDSFRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan's power sector i s severely constraining the development of the country. Officially,&#13;
access to power is only about 6%, one of the lowest inthe world; only 234,000 customers are&#13;
connected to the public grid, of which approximately 30% are inKabul. The other provinces&#13;
have even less access, withrural areas beingvirtually unserved.&#13;
&#13;
The existing facilities provide an unreliable service, and inmost places for a few hours a day&#13;
only. O fthe about 450 MW installedgenerating capacity, only 270MW are available, and most of&#13;
the unitsrequire overhaul or replacement. Distribution systems inthe country are dilapidated or&#13;
non-existent due to insufficient investment, lack of maintenance, and looting or theft over the past&#13;
25 years. The substations and low voltage distributionnetworks of Kabul and other cities are&#13;
totally inadequate, overloaded and mostly outdated. Substantial reconstructionand expansion of&#13;
the distribution systems, basedonmodem least cost design concepts, will be required.As soon as&#13;
the distribution systems are reinforced, transmission and generation will become even more&#13;
inadequate than they are today, due to rapid growing load and energy demand.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
The broadobjective of the Emergency Power Rehabilitation Projecti s to provide an improved&#13;
and more reliable power supply to the people inKabul and other mainprovincial cities of the&#13;
country, including Kunduz, Mazar-e Sharif, Baghlaflule-khumri, Sheberghan, Herat, Jalalabad,&#13;
Kandahar, Lashkagah and Griskh. This objective wouldbe achieved by (i)       rehabilitating and&#13;
enhancing the existing dilapidatedgeneration, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and by&#13;
(ii)developingthe institutional capacity of the MWP and DABMto initiate improved commercial&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
Theproject includes the following components:&#13;
         Rehabilitationand Expansion of DistributionNetworks inKabul-AFG/03 178 (US72&#13;
         million, IDA).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Potentialadverseimpactsof the project&#13;
&#13;
The majority of environmental and social impacts of power projects are generally relatedto&#13;
generation development andrehabilitation. Becausethe project will mostly finance the&#13;
rehabilitationand expansion of distribution systems, implementationof the project components i s&#13;
not expected to involve any significant adverse environmental or social impacts. Specifically:&#13;
&#13;
          The rehabilitation and expansion of distributionnetworks inthe cities involves the&#13;
          construction of distributionnetworks (erecting poles, stringinglines, and installing&#13;
          transformers and sub-stations) at current locations or along existing roads, streets or&#13;
          lanes. While some disruptions inday-to-day activities duringconstructionmay be&#13;
          inevitable, these impacts will be temporary. Furthermore, no land or other assets are&#13;
          expected to berequiredfor the distributionlines or sub-stations.&#13;
          The rehabilitation of the Naghlu Hydropower Station will involve procurement and&#13;
          installation o f electro-mechanical equipment (mainly to replace equipmentthat was&#13;
          damagedduringthe war) at the existing dam site. This i s not expected to have any&#13;
          impact on water flows inthe river.&#13;
          Rehabilitation o f the 110kV Naghlu-Kabul line (involving the reconstructionof&#13;
          transmission line towers, replacement o f insulators/conductor, etc.) will also be largely&#13;
          along the existing route of the line, and no additional land i s expectedto be required for&#13;
          tower locations, right-of-way, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Mostpotential environmental impacts are relatedto sitting of facilities (such as sub-stations),&#13;
constructionactivities and the possible presence of mines. Assessment and mitigation of&#13;
potential impacts will be addressedthrough the applicationof environmental codes o f practices,&#13;
mineriskand safetyprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Potential social issues include:&#13;
&#13;
0         Land ownership and land acquisition: No land acquisitionis expected for the&#13;
          rehabilitation of existing power facilities, includingright-of-way and sub-stations. The&#13;
          riskofinvoluntary resettlement or landacquisitionistherefore consideredto be&#13;
          extremely low.&#13;
&#13;
0         Riskof social tensions duringconstructionperiod: There are somerisks ofincreased&#13;
          social tensions relatedto the planning of the power rehabilitation project, and thehiring&#13;
          o f contractors andtheir relationswith the localresidents.&#13;
e         Riskof disruption to social patterns and safety issues: Forpower lines passing through&#13;
          populated areas, the constructiono f sub-stations could disruptregular patterns or&#13;
          introduce safety concerns for activities such as water fetching by women and children. In&#13;
          these cases, local consultations with women shouldidentifysuch concerns and design&#13;
          measures, such as marked crossings and speed reductionmeasures will be introduced.&#13;
          Local employment: Employment benefits are expected from the power rehabilitation&#13;
          works. Mechanisms to ensure that localpopulations are the beneficiaries will to be&#13;
          defined as much as possible andrealistic, within the social and ethnic context o f each&#13;
          component o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
While field reviewshave shownthat no direct impacts on archeological, burial or historical sites&#13;
are to be expected, the project will institute "chance find" procedures to ensure protection o f such&#13;
sites if found when openingborrow pits and material sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The project will not include capacity building andtraining for MWP andDABMon social and&#13;
environmental management ofpower sector projects, becauseit will be providedunder a separate&#13;
and parallel IDA-fundedactivity to be carried out during2004.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
&#13;
While no significant impacts are expected, an Environmentaland Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
has been developed for the Project. The key objective of this Frameworki s to ensure that all&#13;
activities underthe Project will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0        Protect human health;&#13;
0        Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
0        Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual sub-projects or their&#13;
         cumulative effects;&#13;
0        Enhance positive environmentaland social outcomes; and&#13;
0        EnsurecompliancewithWorldBank safeguardpolicies.&#13;
&#13;
General Principles&#13;
&#13;
Recognizingthe emergency nature of the power rehabilitation project, andthe relatedneed for&#13;
providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence inmanagingpotential&#13;
environmental and social risks, this Framework i s based onthe followingprinciples:&#13;
&#13;
(i)      The proposed project will support multiplecomponents -the -detailed designs of which&#13;
         may not be knownat appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's&#13;
         safeguardpolicies, the Framework provides guidance onthe approach to be taken during&#13;
         implementation.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)     All proposed components will be screenedto ensure that the environmentalandsocial&#13;
        risks can be adequately addressedthrough the application o f standardized guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)    Project design will aim to maintainregional balance, and equity between genders, and&#13;
         ethnic andreligious groups, considering variations inpopulation density. Employment&#13;
         opportunities withinthe projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis of&#13;
        professional competence, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. Inall&#13;
        projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries,&#13;
         consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of boththe male and the female&#13;
        population.&#13;
&#13;
(iv)     Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplifiedto meet the special needs of&#13;
        thisproject. Prior to approvalbythe World BankBoard, this Environmentaland Social&#13;
         Safeguards Framework will be disclosed inAfghanistan inDariandPashto, and inthe&#13;
        World Bank Infoshop.&#13;

            certified as low risk (see guidelines inAttachment 5).&#13;
&#13;
Land Acquisition&#13;
&#13;
While no land acquisition i s expected under the project, guidelines for land, asset acquisition,&#13;
entitlements and compensation as provided inAttachment 2 will be followed, shouldthe Project&#13;
require the acquisition of any landor other assets.&#13;
&#13;
Rehabilitationof the Naghlu Hydropower station&#13;
&#13;
The rehabilitationofthe NaghluHydropower station isnot expectedto have any impact on water&#13;
flows. However, the Contractor implementingthe works will be required to ensure that&#13;
environmental impacts, ifany, be adequately mitigated at bothconstructionand operation stages.&#13;
Special emphasis will beplaced on possible impacts on the riverine andreservoir ecosystems.&#13;
The Contractor's obligations vis-&amp;vis environmentalmanagement will be includedinthe&#13;

&#13;
     Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition,EntitlementsandCompensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Land acquisition will bekept to a minimumandno person will be involuntarily displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed by the proposed emergency reconstructionoperations. Subproject proposals&#13;
that would require demolishinghouses or acquiring land should be carefullyreviewedto&#13;
minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than&#13;
minor expansion alongrights of way should bereviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition&#13;
may take place outside o fthese guidelines. A format for LandAcquisition Assessment i s&#13;
attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructionsto compensate affected persons to ensure that&#13;
all suchpersons negatively affected, regardless of their landtenure status, will be assistedto&#13;
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to&#13;
pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
Basedonthe number of personsthat may be affectedby the project (Project Affected People,&#13;
PAPs) andthe magnitude of impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
&#13;
a.      S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement of more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
        where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) mustbeproduced. Such interventions will&#13;
        be ineligible for support under the proposed emergencyreconstructionoperations.&#13;
&#13;
b.      S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement of lessthan 200 persons. In&#13;
        such cases, the following documentation i s required:(1) a land acquisition assessment,&#13;
        (2) the Minutes or recordof consultations which assess the compensation claimed and&#13;
        agreementreached, and (3) a recordo fthe receipt of the compensation, or voluntary&#13;
        donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
&#13;
C.      S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisitionor any other significant adverse&#13;
        social impacts; onthe contrary, significant positive social impact and improved&#13;
        livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are identifiedas personswhose livelihood, land, structures or other assets are directly or&#13;
indirectly affectedby the project. PAPs deemedeligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
(1)     those who have formal legalrightsto land, water resourcesor structuresibuildings,&#13;
        including recognized customary andtraditional rights;&#13;
&#13;
(2)     those who do not have such formal legal rightsbuthave a claim to usufruct rightrooted&#13;
        incustomary law;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
( 3 )   those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall within (1)&#13;
        and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
Acquisition ofProductiveAssets&#13;
&#13;
Landacquisitionmay take place through the following methods:&#13;

                                 Protectionof CulturalProperty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Physicalculture includes monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropologicalpoint of view,&#13;
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposedpower utilityproject is unlikelyto pose ariskof damaging cultural property, as the&#13;
components involve rehabilitationo f existingpower facilities (Naghlu hydro power station,&#13;
Kabul and other urban distribution network) or expansion o f urban distribution networks only.&#13;
Further,the negative list ofattributes, whichwould make a sub-project ineligible for support&#13;
(Attachment l),   includes any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable cultural&#13;
property. Nevertheless, the followingprocedures for identification, protection from theft, and&#13;
treatment of chance finds shouldbe followed and included in standardbid documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance findprocedures are defined inthe law onMaintenance of Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities andresponsibilities&#13;
of cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered inthe course ofproject&#13;
implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural&#13;
artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
1.       The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment ofhistorical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministryof Information&#13;
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historicalartifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
         made the Archaeological Committee shouldbe informed. Should the continuation of&#13;
         work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
         untila solution is found for the preservation ofthese artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Ifamoveable or immovablehistoricalor cultural artifact is foundinthe countryside ofa&#13;
         province, the provincial governor (wali)or district-in-charge (woluswal)shouldbe&#13;
         informedwithintwo weeks, and they should informthe Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
         case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found ina city, the provincial branch&#13;
         o f the Department of Maintenance of Historical Values o f the Ministryo f Information&#13;
         and Culture shouldbe informedwithin two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find i s made within the&#13;
         center, the Archaeological Committee mustbe informed directly within one week (art.&#13;
         25).&#13;
&#13;
4.       Failure to report a chance find withinthe stipulated time limit will be punishedwith a&#13;
         fine or imprisonment for a period of one week or upto one month(art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
5.       Ifsomeone intentionally damagesahistoricalor culturalartifact, the culprit shallpay&#13;
         compensation inaccordance with the value of the artifact plusbe imprisoned for aperiod&#13;
         o f one monthto ten years depending on the gravity of the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   72&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Incase of achancefindofmoveable or immovablehistorical or cultural artifact, the&#13;
implementingagency is responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage&#13;
untiltheresponsibility hasbeentaken over bythe relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures mustbereferredto as standardprovisions inconstruction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. Duringproject supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will berecorded inWorld Bank Project Status Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation CompletionReports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness of the project's&#13;
culturalresources mitigation, management, and capacity buildingactivities, as appropriate.&#13;

 The most signiJicant environmental criterion for selecting or avoiding an alignment for the power&#13;
 line andor location o f sub-stations i s the presence of sensitive receptors close (within 50m on&#13;
 either side o f the proposed line) to the proposed alignment or proposed location of the substation&#13;
 (within -100m on all sides o fthe perimeter).&#13;
&#13;
 The negative list o f locations as part o f Attachment 1to the Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
 Framework under General Characteristics provides a starting point o f areas to be avoided. Other&#13;
 areas or locations that may be avoided include places o f water bodies, especially those usedfor&#13;
 supply o fdrinkingwater, locally important religiouslcultural sites, schools, play grounds, etc.&#13;
 For rehabilitation o f the facilities, the previous locations o f the structures shouldbe utilized as far&#13;
 as possible. This will not only save costs but may also be environmentally more desirable since&#13;
 change inland-use would be minimized.&#13;
&#13;
 Ifsuchlocations havebeenconvertedto other uses anditisnotpossibleto change the current&#13;
 use, the facilities shouldbe sited on government land as far as possible.&#13;
&#13;
 Route alignment selection can be carried out on historical maps or more recent satellite imagery&#13;
 as available supplemented with walk-throughs along the preferredalignment for such a stretch o f&#13;
 the alignment where it i s practically feasible. The walk-throughldetailed reconnaissance visit&#13;
 mustbe completed beforethe constructionphase begins to ensure that no sensitive environmental&#13;
 receptors are affected duringthe construction and operation stages o f the project.&#13;

                            Procedures for Mine Risk Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Procedures for MineRiskManagementinWorld Bank-FundedProjectshavebeen designedto&#13;
respondto the risks causedby the presence of mines inAfghanistan, inthe context of:&#13;
&#13;
e       Community rehabilitatiodconstruction works to be identified and implementedby the&#13;
        communitiesthemselves (for small projects of up to $100,000 each);&#13;
e       Small and medium-size works to be identifiedby local authorities and implementedby&#13;
        local contractors (for projects upto $5m each);&#13;
e        Works to be implementeddirectly by Government departments/agencies,without use of&#13;
        contractors;&#13;
e       Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m);&#13;
&#13;
For the power project, the relevant procedure i s the one applicable to large works using&#13;
contractors, which i s detailed below.&#13;
&#13;
General comment applying to all followingprocedures: All risk assessment and clearance tasks&#13;
shall be implementedincoordination with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).&#13;
These procedures may need to be amended inthe future dependingon evolving circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Large Works Using Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to large works to be implementedby large contractors&#13;
(projects above $5m).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: The maincontractor shouldberesponsible for dealing with mine-related&#13;
risks, incoordination with the UNMine Action Center.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1.      As part ofthe preparation ofthe biddingdocuments, a general survey shouldbe carried&#13;
        out by M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) on all the areas&#13;
        where contractors may have to work (broadly defined). This survey should provide&#13;
        detailed informationon mine-relatedrisks inthe various areas allowing for an un-&#13;
        ambiguous identification o f areas that have a nil-to-low risk of mine/UXO contamination&#13;
        and areas where the risk i s either higher or unknown. The survey should be financed out&#13;
        o f the preparationcosts of the biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
2.      All survey information shouldbecommunicatedto thebidders (with sufficient legal&#13;
        caveats so that it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning of their&#13;
        activities (e.g., location of campsites, access roads to quarries).&#13;
&#13;
3 .     Dependingon the nature and location o f the project and on the available risk assessment,&#13;
        two different options can be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Option 1-Mine-clearanceactivities are part of the general contract&#13;
&#13;
a.      Based on the general survey results, a specific budgetprovision for mine action during&#13;
        constructioni s set aside as a separate provisional suminthe tender documents for the&#13;
        general contract.&#13;
b.      As a separatelyidentified itemintheir bid, the biddersinclude aprovision for a further&#13;
        detailed mine assessment and clearanceduringconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
c.      On the instructionof the Supervision Engineer and drawing on the specific provisional&#13;
        sumfor mine actioninthe contract, the contractor uses one ofseveralnominated sub-&#13;
        contractors (or a mineaction organization accredited by MACA) to be rapidly available&#13;
        on call, to carry out assessment prior to initiation ofphysical works inpotentially&#13;
        contaminated areas, and to conduct clearancetasks as he finds may be needed. The&#13;
        Contractor may also hire an internationalspecialist to assisthiminpreparing and&#13;
        supervisingthese tasks. The Contractor is free to chose which ofthe accredited sub-&#13;
        contractors to use, and he i s fully responsible for the quality of the works and i s solely&#13;
        liable incase of accident after an area has beendemined.&#13;
d.      To avoid an "over-use" o f the budgetprovision, the Contractor i s requiredto informthe&#13;
        Supervision Engineer inwriting (with a clearjustification o f the works to be carried out)&#13;
        well inadvance o fmobilizingthe mine-clearing team. The SupervisionEngineer has the&#13;
        capacity to object to such works.&#13;
&#13;
Option2   -Mine-clearanceactivities      are carriedout under a separate contract&#13;
&#13;
a.      Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveyingandor clearingof&#13;
        areas with a not-nil-to-low risk(under the supervision o f the Engineer) by specialized&#13;
        contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The definition of the&#13;
        areas to be further surveyed / cleared should be limitedto those areas where any&#13;
        contractor would have to work, and shouldnot includeareas such as camp sites and&#13;
        quarriedmaterial sites which are to be identifiedby the Contractor duringand after&#13;
        biddingofthe works. As a result ofthese further surveys and possibly clearanceworks,&#13;
        mine-related risk inthe entire contract area i s downgraded to nil-to-low.&#13;
b.      The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent ofthe portion ofthe&#13;
        constructionsite o f which the Contractor is to be givenpossession from time to time,&#13;
        clearly indicating restrictions o f access to areas where the minerisk is not nil-to-low. It&#13;
        also indicates the target dates at which these areas will be accessible. Followingreceipt&#13;
        o f the notice to commence works from the Engineer, the Contractor can start work inall&#13;
        other areas.&#13;
&#13;
c.      The general Contractor is invited to include inits bidan amount for mine-security, to&#13;
        cover any additional survey/clearance he may feel necessary to undertake the works.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Incase ofanaccident, aBoardofInquiryis assembledbyMACAto investigate onthe&#13;
causes o fthe accident and determine liabilities. Large penalties should be applied on the&#13;
Contractor ifthe Boarddetermines that the accident resulted from a breach of safety rules.&#13;
&#13;
5.      All parties involvedinthisprocess arerequiredto closely coordinate withMACA andto&#13;
provide the Government, local communities, MACA, as well as any interested party the full&#13;
available information on mine-relatedrisks that may reasonably be required (e.g., maps of&#13;
identifiedminefields, assessments for specific areas).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          APPENDIX VII: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Giventhe very poor state ofthe sector -both interms o fthe extent and quality o f service, andthe&#13;
physicalcondition o f the assets- investments for rehabilitating and upgradingthe utilities'&#13;
infrastructure or for expanding electricity supplies will entail large benefits for the economy. In&#13;
particular, investments to upgrade the asset base are expected to have short pay-backperiods, and&#13;
yield high(economic and financial) returns. Improvementsinthe quality of supply and greater&#13;
access to electricity are also expected to yield substantial benefits -through a reductioninthe&#13;
cost of energy (relative to what most consumers are currently paying) for the populationat large,&#13;
and also for the industrial and commercial sectors -thereby supportingthe Government's growth&#13;
and poverty reductionobjectives.&#13;
&#13;
According to the DABM'sdata, only about 234,000 customers are directly connected to the&#13;
networks -of these, about 203,000 (around 87%) are ResidentialEamily customers; about 3,000&#13;
(1%) are Government customers-this includes ministrieddepartments, schools, hospitals, and&#13;
military establishments; and the balance (approximately 27,000 or about 12%) are classifiedas&#13;
Other Customers -these are mainly industrial and commercial consumers. This translates into an&#13;
overall access ratio o f about 6% - one ofthe lowest inthe world. However, the number of&#13;
consumers who have access to electricity i s generally acceptedto be muchlarger, and significant&#13;
numbers o f households, commercial establishments etc. are meetingtheir electricity needs&#13;
through small to medium sized generators, or as extensions from existing customers -though the&#13;
extent of the latter type of connections has not been quantified. Also, no formal effort has been&#13;
made to estimate the cost of electricity supply for such consumers.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Benefits&#13;
&#13;
A set of assumptions were used for computingthe benefits ofthis Project. The mainones relate&#13;
to the number of new connections to beprovided duringFYs2004-2007, average annual&#13;
consumption-by consumer category, and the value of electricity for those consumers.&#13;
&#13;
The Government's aim-as defined inthe Power Sector ReformRoadmap (Annex 11)-i s to&#13;
provide about 400,000 additional consumer connections over the next four years. About half of&#13;
these connections will be in(and around) Kabul, and the balance inother regions. Assuming the&#13;
existingratio between family/domestic, government, and other customers i s maintained, this&#13;
translates into about 348,000 domestidfamily connections, about 4,000 additional Government&#13;
connections, and roughly 48,000 Other Customer connections. The economic analysis of the&#13;
                                                                    1&#13;
Project i s based on incrementalelectricity sales to these new consumers, and the value of the&#13;
increased sales i s taken as a measure of the benefits o fthe Project.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
According to DABM,the average electricity consumption of domestidfamily consumers i s 2,400&#13;
kwhperyear. This isvery highfor acountry like Afghanistan, with aper capitaincome ofless&#13;
than US$200 (equivalent) per annum. Since a number of households are receiving electricity&#13;
through a single connection, the utilities' estimate of average household consumption (while it&#13;
may be basedon the actual amounts billed to such customer inrecent years) needs to be scaled&#13;
back. Assumingthat four households receive electricity through a single connection, the average&#13;
electricity consumption per householdwould be 600 kwhper year (50 kwhper month).&#13;
Considering the constrained supply, an assumption of 900 kwhper hear was adopted for the&#13;
economic analysis. The Master Plan estimatesthe averageconsumption o f industrial/commercial&#13;
consumers to be about 9,000 kwhper year        -  after adjusting for load sheddingand suppressed&#13;
demand. This estimate i s usedfor the current analysis. The average consumption of Government&#13;
customers has been assumedto be 2,000 kwhper year.&#13;

                                                         2,000         9,000&#13;

&#13;
The final assumption for the analysis i s the value of a unitof electricity for consumers, and for&#13;
the economy. A number ofproxies can be considered:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0        the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of electricity supply -which i s one measure o f the&#13;
         true value of electricity for the economy,&#13;
0        an "import price" (including some margin for in-country transmissioddistribution costs),&#13;
         or&#13;
0        the cost o f alternate energy which i s saved, by providing electricity.&#13;
&#13;
The first option was discarded since no estimate of LRMC hasbeenprepared for Afghanistan.&#13;
Usingan importprice i s also not very realistic, since imports are not an option for meeting&#13;
electricity requirements for the next few years at least. The value of electricity was therefore&#13;
derivedfromthe cost o f alternate energy sources which consumersare currently using-it&#13;
therefore i s usedas a proxy for consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) price for electricity.&#13;
&#13;
Willingness-to-Pay computations&#13;
&#13;
For domestic/familv consumers, the alternate source for lightingis a simple or pressurized&#13;
kerosene lamp, which are assumedto be equivalent to a 40-watt and a 100-watt bulb,&#13;
respectively. For cooking and space heating, the alternatives available are kerosene (or bottled&#13;
gas) stoves and heaters, while for other appliances (fans, ironing, water pumping, TV/radio,&#13;
fridge, etc) suchconsumers wouldhave to use smallto medium sized generators. Basedon&#13;
marketprices of kerosene lamps, cooking stoves etc, annual O&amp;M requirements of such&#13;
appliances, the retail price o f kerosene, etc., the cost of alternate energy i s computed to be&#13;
between Afghanis 9.8 and 10.6/kwh. The cost electricity from a small size diesel generator (1&#13;
KW) is muchhigher-inpart due to the currentmarketprice (around Afghanis 130,000 each) of&#13;
such units.Basedon current fuel prices and the quantum o f electricity requiredby&#13;
domestidfamily customers, the cost o f generation from a 1KW diesel set works out to Afghanis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     82&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27.2/kWh. For this analysis, the WTP price o f electricity for domestidfamily consumers is taken&#13;
as Afghanis lO/kWh,which i s the lower end o fthe range o f estimates listed above.&#13;
&#13;
The electricity needs o f small scale commercial and industrial users (shops, small restaurants,&#13;
cottage industry,etc) are similar to those o f family/domestic consumers - such enterprises require&#13;
a few bulbs for lighting for about 6 hours a day, and some seasonal requirements for space&#13;
cooling and heating. The cost o f alternate energy for such consumers, therefore, ranges between&#13;
about Afghanis l O / k W h (for kerosene lamps) and Afghanis 27.2kWh (for small size diesel&#13;
generators). The alternative source o f electricity for larger industrialhommercial establishments&#13;
(hotels, offices, factories, etc) wouldbe a medium-size (12 kW) generator. The purchase price o f&#13;
such unitsis assumed to be Afghanis 400,000 each, annual O&amp;M costs at Afghanis 100,000, and&#13;
fuel requirements at 5 litres per hour. Basedon these estimates, the cost o f generation for a&#13;
medium size generator works out to about Afghanis 15.5/kWh. The average WTP price for Other&#13;
Customers i s taken as Afghanis 15kWhfor this analysis.&#13;
&#13;
The alternate source o f electricity for Government customers (offices, schools, hospitals, and&#13;
other such establishments) i s mediumand large size generators, since kerosene lamps or small&#13;
diesel gen-sets cannot meet the needs o f such enterprises. The WTP price o f electricity for&#13;
large/medium sized commercial and industrial units-Afghanis 15AcWh-i s therefore taken as&#13;
the WTP price for Government customers also.&#13;

Economic Costs&#13;
&#13;
The investment program for the power sector (for FY 2004-2007) i s taken as the economic cost o f&#13;
the Project. The investmentprogram i s funded entirely by donors, andthere are no taxes on&#13;
imported machinery, equipment, or works contracts; the investmentestimates can therefore be&#13;
considered as "border price equivalent", andno further adjustment i s required for converting&#13;
them to economic costs. Since benefits are defined as "the value o f additional electricity sales&#13;
duringFYs2004-2007", the entire investment programfor the power sector (as opposed to only&#13;
the distributioninvestments -which account for the bulk o f the program to be financed by IDA)&#13;
has to be considered as the cost o f the Project. Incase generation and transmission costs were not&#13;
included, it would amount to understating the true economic cost o f additional electricity&#13;
supplies, since the incremental saleshpplies will not be possible without the generation and&#13;
transmission investments. The full FY2004-07 investment program for the power sector -&#13;
amounting to about US$920million-i s therefore taken as the economic cost o f the Project.&#13;

            The Emergency Power Rehabilitation
            Project aims to improve supplies of electricity to Kabul and
            other cities through the rehabilitation and expansion of
            distribution networks, rehabilitation of the largest
            generation station supplying Kabul and the associated
            transmission line, commercialization of the operations of
            the power utility in Kabul, and capacity building for
            ministry and utility staff. The project consists of eight
            components: Specifically, component 1 rehabilitates and
            expands distribution networks in Kabul. Component 2
            rehabilitates and expands distribution networks in up to 10
            provincial cities. Component 3 rehabilitates one 10 kV
            transmission line Naghlu-Kabul East-Kabul North. Component 4
            provides technical support for rehabilitation and expansion
            of the distribution networks in Kabul. Component 5 provides
            technical support for rehabilitation and expansion of the
            distribution networks in provincial cities. Component 6
            supports commercialization of Afghanistan's electricity
            utility (DABM). Component 7 provides technical assistance
            for the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) and the DABM.
            Component 8 provides contingency funds.
