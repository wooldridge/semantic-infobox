2.3.   The Bank will invest and reinvest the Contributions pending their disbursement in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank will credit all income from such investment to the Trust&#13;
Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
3.1.   In order to assist in the defrayment of the costs of administration and other expenses&#13;
incurred by the Bank's central units under this Arrangement, the Bank may deduct and retain for&#13;
its own account an amount equal to three fourth of one percent (0.75%) of each Contribution. In&#13;
addition, the costs of the Trust Fund management, administration and supervision by the Bank's&#13;
managing unit (including the establishment and operation of a permanent Trust Fund Secretariat)&#13;
will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis, up to a maximum of -i.e. not to exceed- one&#13;
and one half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Contributions. If the Contributions increase beyond&#13;
what was originally expected at the time of counter-signature of the first administration&#13;
arrangements, and the administrative costs increase as a result, the Donors acknowledge that an&#13;
additional administrative fee may be applied to such new contributions.&#13;
4.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
4.1.   The Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into&#13;
grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with eligible recipients selected in accordance with&#13;
the governance terms of Annex I (the "Recipients") consistent with the purposes of this&#13;
Arrangement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant&#13;
Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors&#13;
have decided to make available under the Administration Arrangements between the Bank and&#13;
the Donors. Upon request by a Donor, the Bank will furnish a copy of the Grant Agreements to&#13;
the Donors.&#13;
4.2.   The Bank will be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under the&#13;
Grant Agreements (other than those executed by a UN-FPA Signatory). Subject to the consent of&#13;
the relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be invited by the Bank to participate&#13;
in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
4.3.   The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms&#13;
of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under&#13;
any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the Donors the&#13;
opportunity to exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such&#13;
remedy. Modifications to the terms of any Grant Agreement or similar documents entered with a&#13;
UN-FPA Signatory will be governed by the FPA Standard Provisions.&#13;
5.     Procurement&#13;
5.1.   For Recipient-executed activities, the Grant Agreements will provide that the&#13;
Contributions shall be used by the Recipients to finance expenditures for goods and services, as&#13;
the case may be, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on "Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" and the Bank's Guidelines on the "Selection and Employment of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers," as in effect at the date of entry into the respective Grant&#13;
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, procurement activities for any project implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-13 -&#13;
by a UN-FPA Signatory shall be governed by the terms of the Grant Agreement entered with&#13;
such UN-FPA Signatory, in accordance with the FPA Standard Provisions.&#13;
5.2.   For Bank-executed activities, the employment and supervision of any consultants and the&#13;
procurement of any goods financed by the Contributions will be the responsibility of the Bank&#13;
and will be carried out in accordance with its applicable policies and procedures.&#13;
6.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
6.1.   The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the&#13;
Contributions deposited in the Trust Fund account and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
6.2.   The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in United States Dollars of the Trust Fund with respect to the&#13;
Contributions via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6)&#13;
months after all commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the&#13;
Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements&#13;
and fund balance in United States Dollars of the Trust Fund with respect to the Contributions&#13;
will be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure&#13;
website.&#13;
6.3.   The Bank will provide to the Donors, within six (6) months following the end of each&#13;
Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report, comprising (1) a management assertion together&#13;
with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (2) a combined&#13;
financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's&#13;
opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the Bank.&#13;
6.4.   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will decide on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following the decision on the scope and&#13;
terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit,&#13;
including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, will be paid by the requesting&#13;
Donor.&#13;
6.5.   The Bank will provide the Donors with copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;
reports received by the Bank from the Recipients pursuant to the Grant Agreements.&#13;
7.     Progress Reporting&#13;
7.1.   The Bank will provide the Donors with a semi-annual report on the progress of activities&#13;
financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the final disbursement date specified in&#13;
paragraph 8.2, the Bank will furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
7.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund. The Donor&#13;
and the Bank will agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will&#13;
provide all relevant information within the limits of its policies and procedures. All associated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 14-&#13;

8.1.   The Contributions may be used to retroactively finance payments for eligible&#13;
expenditures in accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures, including expenditures&#13;
incurred prior to the date of signature of this Arrangement, but on or after January 28, 2010.&#13;

December 31, 2020. The Bank will only disburse Contributions for the purposes of this&#13;
Arrangement after such date with the written approval of the Donors.&#13;

part of the Donor's pro rata share, of any remaining balance of the Contributions that is not&#13;
committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or&#13;
other third parties for the purposes of this Arrangement prior to the receipt of such notice,&#13;
including the Grant Agreements.&#13;
8.4.   Following the final disbursement date specified in paragraph 8.2, the Bank will return&#13;

Donors' paid Contributions. In the event of a cancellation the Bank will promptly return to the&#13;
Donors, the Donors' pro rata share of uncommitted Contributions in accordance with paragraph&#13;
8.3.&#13;
9.     Disclosure&#13;
The Bank may disclose this Arrangement and information on this Trust Fund in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's policy on disclosure of information, in effect at the time of such&#13;
disclosure. By entering into this Arrangement, Donors consent to disclosure of this Arrangement&#13;
and information on this Trust Fund.&#13;
10.    FPA Standard Provisions&#13;
Notwithstanding any provision of this Arrangement to the contrary, the terms and&#13;
conditions set out in the FPA Standard Provisions will apply to those proceeds of the&#13;
Contributions to this Trust Fund that are made available to any UN-FPA Signatory by the Bank&#13;
under a Grant Agreement that so provides.&#13;
