&#13;
    Contestation over the content of the human                The rapid growth in the number of ATI&#13;

    dural rules, and so onâ&#128;&#148;normally starts long           cure amendments are in progress. And we&#13;
    before an access to information (ATI) law is          now have an important track record of such&#13;
    first adopted. It continues, with varying de-         attempts and their outcomes. The present re-&#13;
    grees of intensity, more or less ever after. An       port is an initial effort to examine this issue. It&#13;
    important part of this contestation takes the         charts some emerging trends and draws some&#13;
    form of attemptsâ&#128;&#148;by civil society, by govern-         preliminary conclusions on the experiences to&#13;

    about these attempts: what they focused on,           who are promoting the right to information.&#13;
    who has motivated them, what the results                  When an ATI law has been adopted, a&#13;
    have been, and what the trends are.                   number of different actions affect the exercise&#13;

         One reason could be that the right to in-           in a constitutional challenge does, however, de-&#13;

Governance is one of seven priority themes in the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s recently launched renewal strate-&#13;
gyâ&#128;&#148;a strategy that responds to client demand for peer-to-peer learning by grounding WBIâ&#128;&#153;s work in the dis-&#13;
tillation and dissemination of practitioner experiences. The Institute is committed to building knowledge and&#13;
capacity on the â&#128;&#156;how toâ&#128;&#157; of governance reforms, with emphasis on supporting and sustaining multistake-&#13;
holder engagement in bringing about such reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WBIâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice works with partners, including networks of country and regional institutions, to&#13;
develop and replicate customized learning programs. Its programmatic approach aims at building multistake-&#13;
holder coalitions and in creating collaborative platforms and peer networks for knowledge exchange.&#13;

            Amending access to information legislation
            : legal and political issues
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper is about efforts to amend the
            legal framework for the right to information, with a
            particular focus on access to information (ATI) laws. It
            looks at the main substantive issues such reform attempts
            have targeted and what legal forms they may take. It also
            examines the role different actors - civil society, the
            media, oversight bodies, parliaments, and political leaders
            - can play in helping support the adoption of reforms that
            promote openness and defeat those that erect barriers. The
            paper is an initial attempt to examine this issue, based on
            the growing body of experience globally in this area. The
            rapid growth in the number of ATI laws globally means that,
            at any given time, a significant number of serious attempts
            to secure amendments are in progress. When an ATI law has
            been adopted, a number of different actions affect the
            exercise of the right to information. This paper is divided
            into two main parts. The first part provides an overview of
            some of the reform initiatives that have been achieved or
            attempted in countries around the world - law reform,
            constitutional reform, and reform of secondary legislation
            and with an analysis of their key thematic focuses and some
            legal process issues. The second part provides an assessment
            of the role of different players in these reform initiatives
            - players such as civil society, oversight bodies,
            parliaments, and political champions - with a particular
            focus on factors that promote the success of positive
            reforms. In general, an amendment that enhances transparency
            is described as a positive amendment, and an amendment that
            increases secrecy or creates obstacles to access is
            described as a negative amendment.
