. The Congolese economy posted strong growth of 6.4 percent in 2074 in a context of declining inflation owing to lower&#13;
oil prices, the deterioration of domestic demand, and the depreciation of the CFA franc in the second half of the year.&#13;
. The declining oil prices resulted in a fiscal deficit, in 2074, for the first time since 2003, measuring around 5.6 percent&#13;
of GDP as compared to a surplus of 78 percent in 2073.&#13;
. The Congolese economy could have grown more strongly had it not been for Operation on undocumented immigrants, which&#13;
significantly reduced domestic demand and caused an upheaval in commercial transactions between Congo and the DRC&#13;
. Another year of weak economic growth of about 7.3 percent is expected in 2075. This situation is likely to result in a&#13;
deterioration of some of the social indicators.&#13;
. The Government could cushion this slowdown by using its savings effectively for stabilization purposes in order to&#13;
maintain an adequate level of current and capital expenditure.&#13;
'According to preliminary figures that have not as yet been confirmed, the 2014 fiscal deficit is expected to be even higher, at around&#13;
7 percent to 8 percent of GDP.&#13;

BOX 1.1: Entry into Operation of the Maloukou Industries&#13;
In application of the economic diversification approach put forward in the 2012-2016 IND, which is the implementation&#13;
document for the President's social program entitled the Future Path, the Government launched the creation of a&#13;
commercial and industrial zone in Maloukou in August 2012. This is an integrative project, which in its first phase involves&#13;
the construction of 16 factories, a cooling plant, and four warehouses for the distribution of the industrial output.&#13;
At an estimated cost of CFAF 290 billion in government financing, Maloukou is intended to attract foreign investment.&#13;
This zone is specialized in the production of construction materials. An integral part of the Brazzaville special economic&#13;
zone, its aim is to make the products needed in the construction and public works sector and to establish the industrial&#13;
production of (i) tiles and metalwork; (ki) rotomoldingof galvanized sheeting(500 metric tons per month)and PVC(polyvinyl&#13;
chloride) tubes and pipes (1,000 metric tons per month); and (iii) ceramic cladding.&#13;
In 2014, the construction works were completed and 5 factories (metal tiles, sheeting, pipes, ceramic tiles, and bricks)&#13;
entered into production. Factoriesfor the manufactureof electric wiring and prefabricated concrete are expected to follow&#13;
shortly. In the end, the Maloukou industrial zone will include factories for the manufacture of galvanized sheeting, bricks,&#13;
ceramictiles, PVC tubes and pipes, electrical cables, metal tiles, plastic tanks and other containers, sanitation equipment,&#13;
mortar, cement beams and metal towers.&#13;
The 200,000 hectare area is projected tocreatel15,000 jobs by202C.The impacton NOGDP will be about US$700 million and,&#13;

of these works led to an upward adjustment in the&#13;
Government's capital budget by 25.7 percent, from&#13;
the CFAF 1,997.9 billion initially projected at end-&#13;
2013 to CFAF 2,494.8 billion in the June 2014&#13;
supplementary budget. Moreover, with the continu-&#13;

ï»¿BOX 1.2: Strategic Policy of Extractive Industry Companies in Congo&#13;
No cancellations of investments in the oil sector have been officially announced by oil-producingcompanies in Congo (Eni,&#13;
Chevron, Total, etc.). Recent information received from these companies shows that they are delaying their investment&#13;
commitments. If the price of oil remains low in the medium term, some may reduce their involvement.'&#13;
The drop in oil prices and the decline in the prices of major minerals, such as iron, that followed will have a greater negative&#13;
impacton mineral exploration. Low mineral prices reducetheirattractiveness,which makescompanies lessinclined to makethe&#13;
investments for producing or operating new sites. Moreover, loweroil prices reduce the Government's fiscal space, preventing&#13;
it from continuing the infrastructure investment needed for the operation of certain mining sites. For example, the start-up&#13;

is also a risk that could affect the fiscal indicators&#13;
between 2015 and 2017. Although the share of oil&#13;
revenues in total public revenues has declined over the&#13;
past three years, it still represented three-quarters of&#13;
revenues in 2013. Moreover, a price below US$40/b&#13;
could lead some oil companies to reduce or even stop&#13;
production, which would further decrease government&#13;
revenues and would threaten the jobs of a portion&#13;

Congo is currently preparing and implementing reforms that should result in its compliance with all of the CAEMC 2011&#13;
directiveson publicfinances by2020.The Ministryof Economy, Finance, Planning,the Public Portfolioand Integration set up&#13;
two entities in 2012 and 2014 to guide these complex reforms: a Steering Committee for the Integrated Government Revenue&#13;
and Expenditure System (SIDERE) and a Steering Committee for the Government's program budgets and appropriations.&#13;
The first committee aims to improve the program budget process. The reform of revenue procedures was launched&#13;
to supplement the current expenditure procedures (SIDERE), which do not yet produce all the expected accounting&#13;
documentation and do not include all cash flow operations and all services of the revenue agencies (tax, customs, etc.).&#13;
The second is responsible for aligning the general public accounting regulations (RGCP), the government chart of&#13;
accounts, the budget nomenclature and the TOFE with the principles set out in the CAEMC's2011 Code for Transparency and&#13;
Good Governance in the Management of Public Finances. To date, of all the implementing regulations for the 2011 CAEMC&#13;
directives to be transposed into national law, only the organic law on the financial regime of the Government has been so&#13;
transposed, in September 201-although some information and provisions remain to be improved. The provisional RGCP&#13;
documentsand budget nomenclature are being reviewed by expert technical and financial partners before final adoption.&#13;

KEY MESSAGES&#13;
" Over the coming three years, Congo can expect a sharp increase in its oil production in a context of record low oil prices.&#13;
" With public finances characterized by the absence of a general fiscal rule for the management of public revenues and&#13;
expenditures, a zero deficit fiscal policy in 2075 would be procyclical and likely to amplify the harmful effects of the&#13;
decline in oil prices.&#13;
. The Congolese Government would benefit from adopting a fiscal rule based on the non-oil fiscal balance and including&#13;
smoothing by means of the 8-year moving average for the price of oil to be budgeted and a rule for adequate growth&#13;
of public spending.&#13;
* Congo should implement this rule so as to accumulate sufficient reserves to play both a precautionary and an&#13;
intergenerational equity role. Anchoring to an NOPB/NOGDP ratio of -30 percent seems the most appropriate.&#13;
" The introduction of appropriate institutional mechanisms seems necessary to ensure transparency, efficiency, and the&#13;
strict implementation of the fiscal rules adopted.&#13;

ï»¿BOX 2.1: Decline in the Price of Oil and the 2015 Budget&#13;
The current period of low oil prices and the uncertainty regarding the average price in 2015 have led the authoritiesto revise&#13;
the budget submitted to Parliament in December 2014 downward. In the first version of the budget sent to Parliament&#13;
in October 2014, the Government worked with a price of USS95 per barrel in 2015. However, the sharp decline in prices led&#13;
the Government to revise the price downward and to consider a price of US$50 per barrel for 2015. In the budget finally&#13;
adopted, revenues and expenditures were 11 percent lower than in the October version. Compared with the 2014 budget,&#13;
this represents a 2.9 percent decline, or around 6 percent in real terms., Government oil revenues fell almost 25 percent&#13;
and account for 60 percent of its total revenues.&#13;
In this budget, current expenditures declined sharply, by 8.9 percent, from 2014 to 2015. Although the wage bill and&#13;
personnel spending continue to rise as the Government respects its commitments to civil servants, spending on goods and&#13;
services was cut more than 15 percent. As well, the Government reduced its transfers by more than 25 percent.&#13;
The capital budget also declined. The Government chose to slow its capital spending so as to complete some essential&#13;
infrastructure and the infrastructure for the first phase of the "accelerated municipalization" program, which this year&#13;
concerns two municipalities (Ouesso in Sangha Department and Madingou in Bouenza Department). The investments&#13;
related to the organization of the All Africa Games in September 2015 have been maintained. All necessary investments&#13;
to complete National Highway No.1 from Dolisie to Brazzaville and the construction of the new university in Brazzaville&#13;
(Sassou-Nguesso University at Kintel ) are also maintained.&#13;

Mongolia uses a 16-year moving average of mineral prices (prices of the past 12 years and projected prices for the current&#13;
and next3 years). The formula attaches a higher weight to previous years, providing stability in the revenue forecast while&#13;
allowing for a gradual incorporation of price expectations so that the revenue forecast adjusts gradually to new trends.&#13;
Mexico uses a weighted-average of the 10-year historical average of oil prices (25 percent weight), the short-term price&#13;
(50 percent weight but multiplied by a prudence factor of 0.84 determined on the basis of the standard deviation of oil&#13;
prices), and medium-term prices (25 percent weight). This specification places a higher weight on forward-looking market-&#13;

Fiscal transparency and good governance should&#13;
be given prominence when fiscal institutions are&#13;
established. Congo does not yet have relatively inclusive&#13;
political institutions, i.e., ensuring full participation of&#13;
communities or populations in the choice of local&#13;
investments. As a result, scaling up public investment&#13;
might be counterproductive because the budget process&#13;
does not necessarily reflect broader social preferences&#13;
(see World Bank, 2015, with the example of airports).&#13;

            Republic of the Congo - Report monitoring
            the economic and financial situation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This second edition covers the year 2014
            and the first quarter of 2015 and presents the economic
            outlook for 2015–2017. Beyond the review of recent economic
            developments, the report highlights the main results of the
            World Bank’s analytical work in the Republic of Congo with
            the aim to promote the consistency of the country’s economic
            policies in the medium and long term. This edition covers a
            variety of macroeconomic topics, from policies and economic
            indicators for the real sector to public finance, the
            monetary position and the external sector. It shows that
            Congo’s economy grew strongly in 2014 despite the
            significant decline in the price of oil. The lower oil
            prices will have an even greater impact in 2015 as they
            bring down domestic demand. Moreover, this edition looks in
            particular at the impact of volatile oil prices on the
            country’s economy, emphasizing the most appropriate fiscal
            policies in this context.
