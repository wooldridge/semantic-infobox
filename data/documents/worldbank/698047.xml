            Free-trade status for exporters
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Firms need to have easy access to inputs
            at world market prices to be internationally competitive.
            Free trade--with no tariffs, no indirect taxes, no import or
            foreign exchange restrictions--is the ideal policy goal.
            However, it takes time to achieve free trade. Therefore,
            giving free-trade status to exporters is a practical
            intermediate step for those countries that cannot make the
            move to free trade quickly. This Note reviews free-trade
            status schemes and raises some issues critical to more
            effective implementation of the economywide schemes. The
            specialized schemes--fenced private public export processing
            zones (EPZs), nonfenced EPZs, special bonded manufacturing
            warehouses (BMWs)--are more widely used than economywide
            schemes in countries at early stages of development.
            Economywide schemes--duty exemptions and drawbacks--are
            desirable complementary systems, especially as development
            advances. This Note suggests both schemes be offered in
            parallel so that foreign or private firms can choose
            depending on their particular needs. However, in many
            low-income countries, implementation of the economywide
            schemes has been flawed. Without the proper development of
            the necessary instruments, institutions, and mechanisms, it
            is hard to apply economywide schemes effectively.
