DE VRIES: I came to Washington in 1949 as a student from MIT. I started as a&#13;
                                                                                           policy situations in different countries. Irving had a very exciting group of people,&#13;
summer student with Jacques Polak in the Research Department of the IMF. There, I&#13;
                                                                                           including, of course, my later wife, Margaret Garritsen, and a small group of eight to&#13;
wrote a number of studies. At the end of the summer in 1949, I was offered a&#13;

pennanent position in the Fund. I became a member of the Research Department,&#13;
                                                                                           whom Itving was in close contact.&#13;
which is a very powerful group in the Fund. Then, after a short while (I believe in&#13;

1951), I went over to work in the Exchange Restrictions Department with Irving&#13;
                                                                                           DE VRIES: Well, Irving had a feud in particular with Jacques Polak. Itving was not&#13;
Friedman. In that Department I worked on multiple-currency and foreign-trade&#13;

particularly Nicaragua. The first head of state I met was Anastassia Somosa of&#13;
                                                                                           who was an outstanding monetary economist. Some of his work predated Lord Keynes&#13;
Nicaragua. I also went to Ecuador and Costa Rica. As I already told you in our&#13;

OLIVER: Before we leave the Fund altogether, do you have comments about living&#13;

DE VRIES: You mean the relationship between the two? No, not really. I have the&#13;

Burke Knapp. We had a very good, active group of economists and operators&#13;
                                                                                              When I came back, I was asked shortly thereafter to become an operating division&#13;
working. Unfortunately, Burke Knapp left very shonly after--1 think it was in '56.&#13;
                                                                                           chief for Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. After that, at my request, I became an&#13;

   I went to the Bank and worked in Latin America, and, in 1959, we adopted a baby.&#13;

for awhile. Meanwhile the Bank needed somebody in Colombia. I became an advisor&#13;
                                                                                           wheeling group that had a lot of influence. It was composed of the economic advisors&#13;
in the Colombian Planning Office which worked closely with the President They&#13;
                                                                                           of all the area departments at the time. They were called the economic staff. They&#13;
wanted me to stay for a long rime, but Burke didn't want me to go for a long time, so&#13;
                                                                                           were the remnant of the Economic Department, and Woods from the start was very&#13;

was when Colombia had again become democratic. The dictator, Rojas Pinilla, had&#13;
                                                                                           What you have nor mentioned in that chapter, which I think is very important, is the&#13;
been thrown out of office, and the Bank worked very closely with Colombia.&#13;
                                                                                           work that was done on creditworthiness and the debt problem.&#13;
Colombia had always been a critical test case for the World Bank. The Bank tried&#13;
                                                                                               The World Bank made a real breakthrough on the analysis of the debt problem in&#13;
many new approaches in Columbia.&#13;

   I worked with President Aberto Lleras Camaigo, who, I believe, is still alive today.&#13;
                                                                                           that chapter in your book, George Woods and the World Bank, was a very exciting&#13;

debated important issues.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Why do you think Irving was invited to come at all?&#13;
&#13;
DE VRIES: I think that Woods wanted to do new things. Gene Black was an&#13;
&#13;
international economic statesman. He did great things, like the Kariba Dam, the Indus&#13;
&#13;
River Basin, and the Suez Canal. He went way beyond commercial banking.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara never did anything like that. McNamara expanded and expanded and&#13;
&#13;
expanded, but you know that McNamara was a linear man. Woods was less linear&#13;
&#13;
primarily because he was an innovator.&#13;
&#13;
   At the end of the Black administration, Black had gotten ill and was not personally&#13;
&#13;
involved much any more. Burke Knapp in effect was running the Bank. Jeffrey&#13;
&#13;
Wilson was also V .P. but not as strong and substantive.   What Woods wanted to do&#13;
&#13;
was to break the stranglehold of the project people in the Bank, and that's what he did.&#13;

            On June 28, 1990, Barend de Vries was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Olivier. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1955 to 1984, Mr. de Vries worked in the
            following areas: in the western hemisphere department as a
            senior economist (1955-1959) and as an economic advisor
            (1963-1965); in the economic department as deputy director
            (1965-1967) and as senior advisor (1967-1970); as chief
            economist in the western Africa region (1970-1974) and in
            the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region (1974-1977); in
            the industrial development and finance department as an
            industrial policy advisor (1977-1982); and as policy and
            research advisor in both the industry department (1982-1983)
            and in the energy and industry staff department (1983-1984).
            His transcript concerns his work in Latin America,
            particularly Nicaragua and Brazil, his work with a
            consultative group for Ghana, and the ability of the World
            Bank to provide technical assistance to countries whose
            large projects were a very essential contribution of the
            World Bank.
