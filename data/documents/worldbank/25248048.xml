The Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE) is a multidonor facility established in 2012 to strengthen awareness,&#13;
knowledge, and capacity for gender-informed policy making. The UFGE promotes results by equipping policy makers&#13;
and development experts with data, knowledge, and evidence. This is all made possible with generous support from&#13;
the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain,&#13;
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value and Strategic Alignment&#13;
Value-added                  The UFGE seeks to maximize returns on investments by promoting â&#128;&#157;gender-smartâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
                             approaches in country-level policy dialogue, investment and lending, technical&#13;
                             assistance, and advisory services. It serves as a catalyst for innovation and explores the&#13;
                             frontiers of the gender equality agenda where evidence and data on what works is&#13;
                             lagging in areas such as gender based violence and the care economy. It complements,&#13;
                             but does not fund the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s gender mainstreaming activities.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic alignment          The UFGE plays a key role in providing predictable funding for investments that augment&#13;
                             implementation of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Gender Strategy and Regional Gender&#13;
                             Action Plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Advancing the Gender Equality Agenda&#13;
The UFGE recognizes the critical need for addressing knowledge and data gaps. In order to learn what works and&#13;
what doesnâ&#128;&#153;t, rigorous evidence is critical. By investing in these activities, and acting as a catalyst for work that&#13;
pushes the frontiers of knowledge on gender equality, the UFGE equips policymakers and development experts to&#13;
deliver effective advice and smart development solutions at the country level. The UFGE promotes results in three&#13;
main outcome areas:&#13;
&#13;
1) Influence policy dialogue at the country level by increasing the availability and use of gender data and&#13;
evidence in areas where gaps persist between males and females and in new areas where evidence about solutions&#13;
to address these inequalities is weak.&#13;
&#13;
2) Improve design of operations and programs through knowledge and evidence leading to better-designed&#13;
operations with a sharper focus on implementation and results. Activities aim to strengthen and expand successful&#13;
approaches and translate new evidence into results on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
3) Increase awareness and demand for gender equality interventions with efforts to broaden support across&#13;
a range of partners, and generating awareness and interest among country clients with new data, research and&#13;
evidence.&#13;
&amp;#12;How the UFGE Works&#13;
The UFGE leverages funding to support investments in areas with potentially transformational impact. It provides&#13;
enhanced opportunities for learning across regions and for facilitating cross-sectoral approaches, along with its&#13;
unified governing framework, consolidated results reporting and streamlined administration.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Block Grants&#13;
&#13;
Multi-year block grants to regions provide critical funding in support of priorities identified in Regional Gender&#13;
Action Plans. This work contributes to better diagnosis of binding constraints and increased understanding and&#13;
capacity among our clients to address them at the country and regional level. For instance:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    The UFGE supported the launch of a regional gender-based violence program in South Asia to raise&#13;
         awareness, share knowledge, and forge partnerships with civil society, donors, and governments. In Brazil,&#13;
         select train stations are being equipped with electronic kiosks to help women access legal and social services&#13;
         on topics such as violence, and community-based violence prevention approaches are being tested in&#13;
         Honduras and Guatemala.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Issues such as skewed sex ratios and unpaid care are being moved from the margin to the center of policy&#13;
         dialogue through new data and research in Europe and Central Asia.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Allocations&#13;
&#13;
Strategic allocations provide targeted funding for larger, multi-year activities that are identified as areas where&#13;
investments are likely to have large returns. These include:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Engaging the private sector by developing tools and cost-benefit analysis to help firms better analyze their&#13;
         workforces, procurement, and value chains from a gender perspective and develop steps to better integrate&#13;
         women into their business operations. This work is led by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Supporting Gender Innovation Labs in Africa, East Asia and South Asia, and expanding the model to&#13;
         remaining regions to stimulate cross-fertilization on key interventions to adapt and test in different&#13;
         contexts, and facilitate dissemination and uptake of the results at the global level.&#13;
&#13;
Governance&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Gender Leadership Council (GLC) comprises senior level representatives from each Regional&#13;
Vice Presidency, the Jobs Cross-Cutting Solutions Area, the IFC, Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC), and&#13;
Global Practices. It is the main decision making body for the UFGE.&#13;
&#13;
The UFGE Partnership Council provides upstream strategic guidance on the implementation of the UFGE, plays an&#13;
important role in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to harmonize funding for gender equality, and constitutes a forum for&#13;
collaboration among the donor community. All UFGE donors are represented on the Council.&#13;
