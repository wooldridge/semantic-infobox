PRIVATIZATION AND REGULATORY CAPACITY BUILDING&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK AND SITUATION&#13;
OF THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR&#13;
1.   Introduction.  A study of the parastatal sector conducted in June 1996 in&#13;
cooperation with the General Directorate of Economic Affairs and the Privatization&#13;
Authority (Commissariat general a la privatisation) identified the financial difficulties of&#13;
state-owned enterprises in Gabon and the burden they place on government finance. This&#13;
study confirmed the earlier results of a survey of the private sector and specific sectoral&#13;
studies. These studies have been particularly useful in devising strategies based on&#13;
opening the sectors concerned to competition and on developing plans to privatize public&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
2.    Following the financial crisis caused by the 1986 collapse of oil prices, Gabon&#13;
embarked on a policy to clean up its parastatal sector. Its objectives were to reduce the&#13;
sector's pressure--in the form of subsidies and the cost of government consumption--on&#13;
government finance, and to make the economy more competitive. A series of studies on&#13;
the enterprises was conducted as part of the Structural Adjustment Program concluded&#13;
with the World Bank, but the adjustment measures adopted were partially jeopardized by&#13;
the social unrest that occurred in the early 1990s.&#13;
3.    Starting in 1992, and even more so after the devaluation of the CFA franc, the&#13;
Government decided to recenter its role on its primary functions, a choice entailing a&#13;
move to divest itself of directly productive enterprises backed by a Development Strategy&#13;
Statement and an accompanying World Bank economic recovery loan. This new&#13;
approach was initiated under the adjustment program supported by the IMF's ESAF&#13;
(1995-98), which includes an ambitious program to restructure and privatize the&#13;
parastatal sector. The project presented in this document is in support of that program.&#13;
4.    Structure and Role of the Parastatal Sector in the Economy. The parastatal&#13;
sector comprises some forty enterprises doing business in all sectors of the economy.&#13;
These enterprises, listed in Annex I, are public establishments of an industrial and a&#13;
commercial nature, state-owned corporations, semi-public companies, or companies in&#13;
which the Government is a shareholder. Most of these enterprises have monopolies in the&#13;
sector in which they operate, whether it be telecommunications, water and electricity, or&#13;
the import and export of agricultural and forest products.&#13;
5.    The parastatal sector's contribution to national production accounts for 7.5% of&#13;
GDP. It employs 18,000 workers, or 20% of the formal sector work force, and its share&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of the Public Investment Program, an average of CFAF 8.82 billion a year from 1988 to&#13;
1994, is significant. This gives an idea of the disproportionate weight of the parastatal&#13;
sector in the country's economy.&#13;
Table 1. Republic of Gabon: Role of the Parastatal Sector in the Economy&#13;

V.A. Private Sector    74.7    76.0    74.0    73.1        73.5    78.6&#13;
6.    Performance and Burden on Government Finance.  From  a financial&#13;
standpoint, the net return on capital was -2.4% on average for the sector as a whole&#13;
during the period 1988-1995. Negative returns were seen primarily among enterprises in&#13;
the water and electricity, transportation and agribusiness sectors.  Positive results,&#13;
however, were on record in the telecommunications, oil, forestry, public works, and trade&#13;
sectors.&#13;
7.    The parastatal sector consists predominantly of companies in which the&#13;
Government is majority shareholder, as they account for over 80% of total capital and for&#13;
a majority of jobs. Because of their weight in the economy and the new opportunities&#13;
created by the change in the exchange rate and the introduction of the UDEAC's tax and&#13;
customs reforms, a number of these enterprises' has been identified by the Government as&#13;
priority candidates for reform of the sector. Moreover, an analysis has revealed that the&#13;
negative results declared by these enterprises are largely artificial, and are not related to&#13;
their cash flow. With the exception of HEVEGAB and CFG, the gross surplus of all&#13;
these enterprises is sharply reduced by depreciation and reserves often linked to sunk&#13;
costs, thereby generating losses purely on the books. This gives an indication of the gains&#13;
that could be anticipated once they are privatized. Table 2 below shows key performance&#13;
indicators by subsector.&#13;

8.    Constraints on the Parastatal Sector and the Projected Policy. The problems&#13;
encountered by the parastatal sector present a serious obstacle to the sustainable&#13;
development of the Gabonese economy.  Public enterprises greatly underuse their&#13;
production capacity, which generally ranges from 40 to 65%. This underuse is mainly&#13;
attributed to the following factors: (a) organizational constraints, such as quality of&#13;
management, technological choices, the organization of production, and the shortage of&#13;
capital for investment; and (b) a lack of competitiveness, along with rigid markets and an&#13;
inflexible business environment.&#13;
9.    To cope with this situation, the Gabonese authorities have decided to lighten the&#13;
heavy financial, economic, and social burden placed on the country by the public&#13;
enterprise sector, and to promote the development of a local private sector and private&#13;
foreign investment. To do this, the Government has adopted the program described&#13;
below, which focuses on setting up a legal and regulatory system that favors private&#13;
investment. This program is based on the following: (a) opening up the economy; and&#13;
(b) privatizing the major sectoral government enterprises and selling the Government&#13;
minority shareholdings.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.   Implementation of the privatization program  is based on a well-established&#13;
strategic choice. In the initial stage, the authorities intend to sell only their minority&#13;
shareholdings in a certain number of private companies and their majority shares in seven&#13;
major enterprises, each in a different sector. These include SEEG (electricity and water),&#13;
OPT/TIG (telecommunications, and the postal and financial services), OCTRA&#13;
(railways), AIRGABON (air transport), AGROGABON (palm oil), HEVEGAB (rubber),&#13;
and CIMENTGAB (cement production). This decision is based on lessons learned from&#13;
privatization programs conducted in Africa and other parts of the world, including the&#13;
following considerations: (a) the limits imposed by the administrative, technical, social,&#13;
and political capacity, but also the limited capacity of the market for privatization; and (b)&#13;
the need to have a successful, positive experience, and to ensure social and political&#13;
support for the process.&#13;
11.   Moreover, under a law passed in 1983, all companies setting up business in&#13;
Gabon must pay the Government 10 percent of their capital. This law, which was&#13;
suspended in 1989, also applied to the capital increases of these firms. A total of around&#13;
200 companies were affected by this law. About 150 of these firms are still operating,&#13;
but it is estimated that only 50 of them are of any significance in terms of the volume of&#13;
their business and the size of their profits. The Gabonese Government is also proposing&#13;
to sell the shares it acquired under a 1992 law beneficial to Gabonese investors, and&#13;
especially to small holders and institutional investors.&#13;
12.   Constraints to Developing the Private Sector and the Anticipated Policies.&#13;
The private sector is expected to play a decisive role in Gabon's prosperity and increased&#13;
standard of living. It is clear that the program to open up the economy and privatize will&#13;
spark new opportunities for the growth and development of the private sector. Many&#13;
reforms are still needed, however, to improve the business environment and to build the&#13;
country's institutional capacity.  Creation of an environment favorable to private&#13;
enterprise will in fact facilitate the privatization program and encourage private&#13;
investment. To accomplish this, the Government has undertaken a broad program of&#13;
institutional, legal, regulatory, fiscal, and financial reforms designed to overhaul the&#13;
environment in which the private sector operates. The main thrust of this program, whose&#13;
components are part of the adjustment program with the IMF, is based on the concepts of&#13;
facilitation, transparency, and equity. An Investment Charter, in the process of being&#13;
finalized, embodies the commitments and reforms being put in place. This Charter was&#13;
the subject of intensive consultations with local operators and the Bretton Woods&#13;
institutions.&#13;
13.   Gabonese businessmen view the high level of taxes and the tax administration as&#13;
the most serious threats to business and growth. Problems related to the exchange rate&#13;
are ranked in third place. This, however, may reflect the instability following the 1994&#13;
CFA franc devaluation. The fourth- and fifth-ranking problems are considered to be the&#13;
high cost of financing and the difficulty in gaining access to this financing, in that order.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.   To eliminate these problems, the Government will pursue efforts to revise and&#13;
harmonize the system of incentives, while stepping up the pace of fiscal and customs&#13;
reforms agreed in the context of the UDEAC.&#13;
15.   Benefits of the Project. The reforms advocated under this project are vital to&#13;
economic stabilization and renewed growth in several ways. From an economic&#13;
standpoint, they should produce the following results: (a) considerable reduction in real&#13;
terms of the average cost of production factors such as water and electricity ( 18%) and&#13;
telecommunications (35%); (b) improvement in the quality of services provided and&#13;
greater access to those services by the people; (c) improvement in the productivity of&#13;
labor, while maintaining employment levels, by developing the private sector; and (d)&#13;
substantial decrease in--or even the elimination of--subsidies to enterprises.&#13;
16.   The communications component, restructuring of social security, and the&#13;
possibility for small Gabonese investors to participate in the privatization process should&#13;
enhance the people's understanding and awareness of the country's need for these&#13;
reforms, and should therefore trigger their active participation in implementation of the&#13;
program, which is essential if the program of economic reforms is to succeed.&#13;
17.   Quantification of Project Costs and Benefits. The total financial costs of the&#13;
project are estimated at CFAF 9 billion, or US$16 million. They can be broken down as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* Building popular support for privatization: CFAF 567 million, or US$1 million;&#13;
* Establishing a regulatory system to govern competition and building the&#13;
Government's regulatory capacity: CFAF 1.7 billion, or US$3 million;&#13;
* Restructuring and privatizing the major public enterprises: CFAF 3.7 billion, or&#13;
US$6.5 million;&#13;
* Increasing the participation of nationals in privatization of the parastatal sector: CFAF&#13;
567 million, or US$1 million;&#13;
* Modernizing the legal and regulatory environment in which business operates: CFAF&#13;
850 million, or US$1.5 million;&#13;
* Ensuring adequate management of the program and project: CFAF 1.7 billion, or&#13;
US$3 million.&#13;
18.   A dynamic cost-benefit analysis of the project shows the following financing&#13;
needs during the first four years, from 1997 to 2000: the total cumulative amount of net&#13;
costs should not surpass CFAF 11.3 billion (US$20 million). These costs, however,&#13;
should gradually diminish, and the project should begin turning a profit around the year&#13;
2000. Over the entire period, from 1997 to 2010, the project's net cumulative profits are&#13;
estimated at over CFAF 96 billion, or US$172 million.&#13;
19.   There will also be economic and social benefits in the form of job opportunities,&#13;
estimated at CFAF 21 billion, or US$38 million, productivity gains, which are expected&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to amount to CFAF 32.3 billion, or US$57 million, and economies on the cost of capital&#13;
investment, of the order of CFAF 10.8 billion, or US$19 million.&#13;
20.   Finally, the project will also make it possible to realize unmeasurable indirect&#13;
economic benefits in terms of productivity gains and an improvement in the allocation of&#13;
public moneys. These benefits will come from the following factors: (a) increased&#13;
competition in the industrial and service sectors; (b) an improvement in the regulatory&#13;
structure and the elimination of price controls; (c) a reduction in poverty; and (d) a wider&#13;
distribution of the shares in corporate equity.&#13;
21.   Risks associated with the project. There are domestic and foreign political&#13;
risks, and institutional risks linked to the program.  The political risk stems from&#13;
pressures exerted on the Government by people who have not been properly informed of&#13;
the benefits to be derived from the program of reforms. The upcoming electoral period&#13;
also presents a risk of slowing down the pace of reforms. As for institutional risks, they&#13;
primarily have to do with the limits on the local institutional capacity to implement and&#13;
manage reforms in an effective way.&#13;
22.   Institutional aspects. During the past fifteen years, the Government's efforts to&#13;
pull out of the parastatal sector have gone through seven different institutional changes.&#13;
This is evidence that the implementing agencies are somewhat vulnerable to institutional&#13;
and organizational crises. The tangible effect has been confusion as to roles or a failure&#13;
to clearly define the powers and responsibilities of the various implementing agencies,&#13;
the relevant technical ministries, and the management of the enterprises. This state of&#13;
affairs has been aggravated by the absence of a regulatory and legal structure to govern&#13;
the Government's divestiture policy. This was the situation in February 1996 when the&#13;
Government promulgated a law on privatization and the organizational and functional&#13;
restructuring of the executive agency in charge of the privatization program.&#13;
23.   The new  institutional structure for implementing the privatization program&#13;
consists of two agencies: the Privatization Commission, the decision-making and&#13;
monitoring agency, headed by the Minister of Finance and Economy, with the ministers&#13;
of the relevant technical ministries related to the enterprises as members; and, the&#13;
Privatization Committee, the secretariat and implementing body for the Commission. At&#13;
the head of the Privatization Committee is a secretary, who is in charge of managing the&#13;
program and providing technical guidance for the privatization operations, while&#13;
maintaining a strategic view of the whole process. The Privatization Committee executes&#13;
the decisions made by the Commission on privatization strategy and procedures and plays&#13;
the role of permanent intermediary between the various actors and agents involved in the&#13;
privatization process. It is also in charge of preparing, monitoring, implementing, and&#13;
evaluating the operations carried out under the privatization program.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
SECTION B. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
24.   The Government's strategic objective, to which the project is expected to&#13;
contribute, is growth of private investment and an increased participation of the non-oil&#13;
private sector in the country's economic development. This project is designed to&#13;
achieve this object in the following ways: (a) by creating an environment favorable to&#13;
private investment; (b) by modernizing the legal and regulatory environment of the&#13;
business sector; and (c) by competent and adequate project management. To this end, the&#13;
project will comprise the following components:&#13;
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
A.   Communications&#13;
25.   For years, the lack of a communications plan and strategy has stood in the way of&#13;
popular support for the economic reforms. For instance, the reform of government&#13;
enterprises has become synonymous with an imminent increase in unemployment, a&#13;
further decline in living conditions, the sell-out of the nation's assets, and re-colonization.&#13;
26.   The purpose of the communications component is to gain the people's support&#13;
and political backing for privatization. To accomplish this, it will develop a local&#13;
institutional capacity, which will design and implement an information program aimed at&#13;
improving people's understanding of the issues involved in the economic reforms and at&#13;
initiating a dialogue to promote greater participation by the people in implementing the&#13;
economic program.  This information program  will at the same time allow the&#13;
Government to gain a better understanding of the need for greater public support for its&#13;
program of economic reforms and for using communications technology to this end. The&#13;
project will provide the means to do the following:&#13;
(a)   Set up a privatization information center and communications unit, as part&#13;
of the Privatization Committee;&#13;
(b)   Design and implement a training program to strengthen the Government's&#13;
capacity to make effective use of the media and to establish&#13;
communication and information links with labor unions, consumers, and&#13;
political institutions;&#13;
(c)   Conduct opinion polls and other targeted research to assess public opinion&#13;
on the projected reforms. The results of these studies will make it easier to&#13;
define a communications strategy and to monitor the social and political&#13;
environment of the reforms;&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)   Instruct journalists as to the objectives of the economic reforms; and&#13;
(e)    Make sure that information on privatization and the economic reforms is&#13;
distributed widely.&#13;
27.   A memorandum describing the program and the responsibilities of the&#13;
communications unit and its director was drawn up. This document, together with the&#13;
detailed plan of action and the performance indicators (Annex II), was finalized during&#13;
the appraisal mission.&#13;
B.    Regulatory Capacity Building&#13;
28.   In order to transfer the operations of public enterprises to the private sector, the&#13;
regulatory system must be revised. It is particularly essential to develop the capacity of&#13;
government officials to regulate operators, and especially in sectors such as&#13;
telecommunications, water and electricity, and transportation, where competition will be&#13;
introduced and where there will be dominant operators. In view of this, the purpose of&#13;
the regulatory capacity building component will be to establish the regulations governing&#13;
competition and to put in place the required regulatory capacity.&#13;
29.   To fulfill this mission, the project will provide the necessary support for the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)    Setting up a financially and legally independent, multisectoral regulatory&#13;
structure for the water, electricity, telecommunications, postal, and&#13;
transportation sectors;&#13;
(b)    Revising the sectoral codes and their implementing regulations to&#13;
liberalize economic activities; and&#13;
(c)    Providing outside experts in regulation during the stage devoted to local&#13;
capacity-building.&#13;
30.   A technical report analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the types of&#13;
regulatory structure, such as sectoral vs. multisectoral, or ministerial vs. autonomous, was&#13;
prepared. It enabled the Government to decide on an autonomous, multisectoral&#13;
regulatory agency. The plan of action and the critical stages of this component have been&#13;
finalized (Annex III).&#13;
C.    Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization&#13;
31.   This component is designed to help in restructuring/reorganizing and privatizing&#13;
the major government enterprises targeted. In fact, a law establishing the privatization&#13;
rules for public sector enterprises was promulgated in February 1996 (Law 0 1/96 dated&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
February 13, 1996), and a privatization program was attached to the supplementary&#13;
budget of June 1996. Eight major economic sectors have been targeted for reorganization&#13;
and privatization. They include the following sectors: agrofood, timber, industry and&#13;
trade, posts and telecommunications, water and power, transportation, real property&#13;
services, financial institutions, and computer services. Some of the enterprises were&#13;
identified as priorities on the basis of criteria such as unrealized potential, or an urgent&#13;
need to cut losses, and the like. Consequently, under this component: (a) five major&#13;
sectors2 will be liberalized and the Government enterprises will be restructured and&#13;
privatized; (b) evaluations and studies will be performed to prepare for implementation of&#13;
the second phase of the program; and (c) the Privatization Committee, which is in charge&#13;
of implementing the project, will be set up so that it can operate effectively.&#13;
Office of Posts and Telecommunications (OPT)&#13;
32.   In the summer of 1996, the Government adopted a sectoral policy statement that&#13;
sets the main guidelines for reform of the postal and telecommunications sector. Among&#13;
other things, this strategic document identifies the need to make the following changes, to&#13;
be supported by the project:&#13;
(a)   Total separation of the postal service and telecommunications;&#13;
(b)   Reorganization of the telecommunications sector to create one primary&#13;
telecommunications operator, grouping together TIG, OPT, and part of&#13;
GABTEL's operations;&#13;
(c)   Immediate liberalization of all services offered by the sector, other than&#13;
the basic service;&#13;
(d)   Immediate authorization of an expanded mobile telephone license;&#13;
(e)   Introduction of private capital by privatizing the principal operator;&#13;
(f)    Separation between operations and regulatory functions and introduction&#13;
of the new regulatory functions needed for the sector to operate on the free&#13;
market; and&#13;
(g)   Asystematic reorganization of the postal sector.&#13;
33.   Restructuring Strategy. Separation between the postal service and&#13;
telecommunications requires the two sectors to be reshaped and a specific strategy for&#13;
restructuring each of them to be drawn up. The existing institutions in the&#13;
telecommunications and postal sectors, including the TIG, OPT, GABTEL, and EMS&#13;
2   Telecommunications, water and electricity, comestible oils, rubber, and cement.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Delta Plus, will have to be reorganized and the status of the new companies to be created&#13;
will have to be defined. Thus, the separation and the restructuring plans will entail the&#13;
following:&#13;
For the OPT:&#13;
(a)   Establishing a strategy for each branch of activity beforehand;&#13;
(b)   Establishing an opening balance for each entity;&#13;
(c)   Designing new organization charts; and&#13;
(d)   Arranging for interim management of the residual OPT and the new&#13;
enterprises, until the telecommunications operator is privatized and the&#13;
heads of the postal company are appointed.&#13;
For the telecommunications sector:&#13;
(a)   Adopting a new telecommunications code;&#13;
(b)   Establishing a new set of regulations, including licenses, specifications,&#13;
and the like;&#13;
(c)   Establishing a new rate system and a specific timetable for adjusting the&#13;
rates;&#13;
(d)   Establishing a new system of link-ups among operators; evaluating and&#13;
revising allocation of the spectrum of frequencies; and&#13;
(e)   Privatizing the principal operator.&#13;
For the postal sector:&#13;
(a)    Creating a commercial-type public corporation, by grouping the&#13;
operations of the postal branch together with those of its subsidiary, EMS&#13;
Delta Plus, and with financial services, subject to BEAC regulations;&#13;
(b)    Preparing and implementing a cost reduction program and a social plan,&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   Implementing an active commercial development strategy and plan&#13;
throughout the various branches of activity.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34.   The assistance strategy determined under the project is presented in the following&#13;
action plan. Three teams of consultants will be hired, each of which will perform one of&#13;
the following tasks:&#13;
(a)    Establish the new legal and regulatory system, building the regulatory&#13;
institutional capacity, and awarding the mobile telephone license;&#13;
(b)    Develop a strategy for and implement the restructuring of the three&#13;
branches--posts, telecommunications, and financial services--and&#13;
supervise management during the interim period; and&#13;
(c)    Privatize the operator.&#13;
The first two teams will work at the same time, and the third team will begin its task once&#13;
the work of the first two has progressed sufficiently.&#13;
35.   During negotiations: (a) the implementation schedule was finalized (Annex IV),&#13;
and (b) the terms of reference of the consultants were finalized. Finally, an agreement&#13;
was obtained on appointing a qualified person on a full-time basis, to work on the&#13;
Privatization Committee to monitor and coordinate the work of the various advisors and&#13;
consultants assigned to this program.&#13;
National Water and Electricity Company (SEEG)&#13;
36.   The Government adopted a strategy to restructure the water and electricity sector&#13;
that would enable it to attract private investment, reduce the cost of supplying services,&#13;
increase the service area throughout the country, and limit the role of government to&#13;
defining the sectoral policy and regulation. To implement this strategy, the following&#13;
steps will be supervised and/or carried out with the support of this component:&#13;
(a)    Letting of concession contracts for water and electricity services;3&#13;
(b)    Preparation of the laws and the implementing texts for the new regulatory&#13;
system; and&#13;
(c)    Undertake a prospective study and determine a strategy for developing&#13;
production and bringing electricity to rural areas.&#13;
The Government has given IFC a mandate to carry out the concessioning of SEEG, using national&#13;
budget funds. The bidding for privatization took place in October 1996.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AGROGABON, HEVEGAB, and CIMENTGAB, and Others&#13;
37.   As part of the preparations for this project a study was conducted to determine&#13;
possible alternatives available to the Government to allow it to divest itself of the&#13;
subsidiary, while ensuring its sustainable development. A strategy and an action plan&#13;
(Annex IV) for privatization of AGROGABON were defined on the basis of the&#13;
conclusions of this study. The project will finance the studies on valuation, restructuring,&#13;
and technical assistance for privatization.&#13;
38.   Technical and financial studies will also be carried out to develop strategies and&#13;
action plans for privatization of HEVEGAB and Gabon Cement on the basis of the terms&#13;
of reference already agreed with the Government. As in the case of HEVEGAB, these&#13;
action plans include financial reorganization prior to privatization.&#13;
39.   This component will also provide support for preparation and implementation of&#13;
the second stage of the privatization program, which covers ten enterprises and should be&#13;
ready for implementation by 1998 (Annex I).&#13;
D.   Participation by Nationals in Privatization&#13;
40.   The Government is contemplating two procedures, which are not mutually&#13;
exclusive, for selling off the Government's minority shareholdings to the public:&#13;
(a)   Direct sale of securities to Gabonese investors. This option will apply&#13;
specifically to larger enterprises whose stocks can be sold--SEEG, and the&#13;
future telecommunications and agribusiness companies. To conduct the&#13;
sale of stocks on the market, a private commercial bank or a firm will be&#13;
selected by competitive bidding; and&#13;
(b)   The creation of private mutual investment trusts. This option consists in&#13;
transferring government shareholdings to various trusts. The stocks issued&#13;
by these trusts, managed by private financial institutions (commercial&#13;
banks), would be sold on the market. Shareholdings which are not&#13;
considered to have a high enough value and do not have a profit potential&#13;
would not be transferred to these funds.&#13;
41.   A system of intermediation would be put in place according to the market&#13;
structure set up with the support of the IFC, as part of efforts to organize a secondary&#13;
market for SEEG stock. This system could make it possible to purchase and sell stocks&#13;
under satisfactory conditions of transparency and security.&#13;
42.   To facilitate these arrangements, the project will finance the following:&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)   Preparation of laws and regulations authorizing the sale of the&#13;
Government's minority shareholdings, establishment of private mutual&#13;
investment trusts, a public offering, transactions on the secondary market,&#13;
and establishment of a dealer function, in cooperation with the BEAC, to&#13;
meet regional integration concerns;&#13;
(b)   Evaluation/valuation of shares held by the Government and determination&#13;
of procedures for selling them;&#13;
(c)   Selection by competitive bid of a local financial institution responsible for&#13;
managing the mutual investment trust and investing the stocks in that&#13;
trust;&#13;
(d)   Selection of one or several commercial bank(s) to handle the direct sale of&#13;
shares; and&#13;
(e)   Technical support for dealers in determining the compensation&#13;
arrangements with regard to the stocks.&#13;
The terms of reference and the plan of action with performance indicators have&#13;
been finalized and agreed with the Government.&#13;
E.    Modernizing the Legal Environment for Business&#13;
43.   This component will provide assistance in putting in place an institutional and a&#13;
legal environment conducive to development of the private sector, based on the&#13;
guidelines contained in the Investment Charter being prepared by the Government. The&#13;
project will finance the following activities in this area:&#13;
Business Law&#13;
44.   Gabon has initiated proceedings to ratify the treaty creating the Organization for&#13;
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). The project will support efforts to&#13;
incorporate the uniform acts in Gabonese legislation. It will provide the following&#13;
services to this end:&#13;
(a)   Legal technical assistance to legislative agencies, with a view to the future&#13;
entry into force of the uniform acts of OHADA, including (i) compiling a&#13;
list and computerizing all the applicable laws in Gabon, and (ii) analyzing&#13;
the laws affected by the OHADA project to identify existing laws that will&#13;
have to be abrogated, amended, or updated, and to identify and draft&#13;
supplementary laws that will prove necessary;&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   Support for efforts to disseminate the new business laws and the new&#13;
Investment Charter by printing, publishing, and distributing the texts, and&#13;
organization of both general and specific seminars for the various&#13;
economic operators and legal practitioners; and&#13;
(c)   Assistance in defining and implementing procedures for settling disputes&#13;
in business law by (i) a study concerning the type of structures to put in&#13;
place (for instance, establishing chambers specializing in business law in&#13;
the existing courts, or creating specialized courts, or introducing a national&#13;
commercial arbitration procedure, and (ii) support for setting up structures&#13;
to be used at the end of the study, including specialized training required&#13;
by judges and court employees, and seminars for other legal practitioners&#13;
and persons working in the business world.&#13;
Labor Code&#13;
45.   Preparation of the decrees required to implement the Labor Code following the&#13;
revision currently in progress. Once the standard OHADA act related to labor law comes&#13;
into effect, adaptation of national legislation and, if necessary, assistance in setting up&#13;
specialized courts.&#13;
Social Security&#13;
46.   Performance of an accounting and organizational analysis/audit of the National&#13;
Social Security Fund. Following that audit, social security laws will have to be amended&#13;
to make sure that the Fund's recovery is lasting. The project will provide the technical&#13;
support needed to relieve this.&#13;
47.    The action plans and implementation schedule for this project component were&#13;
finalized and agreed with the Government.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SECTION C. PROJECT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
I. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
48.   The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated at FF 90&#13;
millions, net of taxes. The Government's contribution to the project will be FF 34&#13;
million, or 37% of the total project cost. This contribution will take the form of provision&#13;
of personnel, premises, and the support for establishing and operating the structures&#13;
required by the project. This project will not finance termination grants and/or arrears in&#13;
wages or pensions. The Government, with the support of donors, as part of the flow of&#13;
funds, will therefore make sure that its annual budget includes the amounts needed to&#13;
implement the social plans linked to liquidation of the remaining enterprises and the&#13;
rights of workers. CFAF 10 billion has already been included in the Government's 1997&#13;
budget. The detailed project costs are presented in Annex V, and are summed up below&#13;
(net of taxes).&#13;

A.   Hiring of Consultants&#13;
50.   Agreement was reached on government requirements regarding consultants'&#13;
qualifications and experience, and on employment modalities and conditions for these&#13;
consultants. They will be selected in accordance with the IBRD's principles and&#13;
procedures, and on the basis of the Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers, published by the Bank in January 1997. As a rule,&#13;
consultants will be selected by competitive bidding from a restricted list of consulting&#13;
firms, which will be chosen on the basis of the quality of their offers and the cost of their&#13;
services. As for contracts with a value of less than the equivalent of US$200,000, the&#13;
restricted lists may consist entirely of local consulting firms, if there is a sufficient&#13;
number--at least three--available at competitive prices. However, if foreign firms have&#13;
made it known that they are interested, they will not be excluded. The Bank's standard&#13;
Letter of Invitation and the model Contracts drawn up by the Bank will be used for hiring&#13;
consultants. For audit services not exceeding the equivalent of US$50,000 each, and not&#13;
exceeding a total amount equivalent to US$200,000, the selection will be made on the&#13;
basis of the lowest cost.  For consultant services not exceeding the equivalent of&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$50,000 each, and a total amount equivalent to US$300,000, the selection will be&#13;
made on the basis of the qualifications of the consultants. Consultant services for&#13;
conferences and seminars or for small studies, which are no more than US$50,000 each,&#13;
or a total amount of US$300,000, and which may be provided by individual consultants,&#13;
will be contracted by comparing the qualifications of the candidates who expressed an&#13;
interest in the job or who have been identifiea. Simplified contracts will be used for&#13;
short-term jobs, that is, jobs not exceeding six months performed by individual&#13;
consultants. During negotiations, the new procedures were described to the Government,&#13;
and especially procedures applicable to publication of the invitation to bid and the public&#13;
opening of the bids.&#13;
B.   Purchasing&#13;
51.   Goods and equipment will be grouped together in lots in excess of US$100,000&#13;
per contract, and they will be purchased according to international competitive bidding&#13;
procedures, in conformity with the IBRD's procurement guidelines (January 1995,&#13;
updated in January and August 1996). The IBRD's model bidding documents will be&#13;
used for all international bidding. Goods with an estimated value equal to or less than the&#13;
equivalent of US$25,000 per contract, and up to a cumulative amount equivalent to&#13;
US$100,000 may be purchased following consultation with national suppliers.&#13;
C.   Bank Examination&#13;
52.   Contracts for supplies in excess of the equivalent of US$100,000 must be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for prior examination. The Bank's prior examination will cover&#13;
50% of the total amount of the transactions. A selective a posteriori examination will be&#13;
performed on every one out of three, for transactions that do not surpass the threshold&#13;
amounts. The Bank will examine the procedure for selecting consultants proposed by the&#13;
borrower. The borrower was reminded that for consultant contracts at a cost equivalent to&#13;
US$200,000 or more, financing offers will not be opened before receipt of the Bank's&#13;
"non-objection" notice regarding the evaluation of the technical offer.  The prior&#13;
examination by the Bank will not be required for contracts with consulting firms when&#13;
they are for less than the equivalent of US$100,000, or for contracts with individual&#13;
consultants, which are for less than US$50,000. However, the exception to prior&#13;
examination by the Bank will not be applied to the terms of reference of said contracts,&#13;
whatever their value may be. Nor will it be applicable in the case of critical work, as&#13;
defined by the Bank, or to codicils of contracts, when they cause the value of the contract&#13;
to increase above the threshold, thus requiring the prior examination of the Bank. In the&#13;
course of negotiations, a general procurement notice was agreed, and it will be published&#13;
in the "Business Development" magazine.&#13;

III. DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES&#13;
53.   Table 6 itemizes the amounts for each loan category.  The percentage of&#13;
expenditures to be financed, net of taxes or duties, is 100% for consultant services,&#13;
training, and equipment. The costs of operations and organization of local seminars will&#13;
be paid out of the counterpart funds.&#13;

Exchange rate = FF 5. 67/US$J&#13;
55.   To facilitate disbursements and make sure funds are available, the Government&#13;
will set up and keep a special foreign currency account with a commercial bank, in&#13;
accordance with procedures and conditions acceptable to the IBRD. This special account&#13;
will be managed by the Secretary of the Privatization Committee (Project Coordinator).&#13;
The amount authorized for this special account is FF 3 million.  Requests for&#13;
replenishment will be submitted to the IBRD every month, or at the intervals requested&#13;
by the IBRD. The Government must also open a project account separate from the&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
special account, to hold the contribution to be used to finance the project's operating&#13;
costs.&#13;
56.   Disbursements will be made using the IBRD's standard documents, except for&#13;
contracts of consultant firms in amounts less than the equivalent of US$100,000, and for&#13;
contracts with individual consultants in amounts less than the equivalent of US$50,000,&#13;
for which expense statements will be used. The vouchers for these statements will be&#13;
kept at the project office and will be checked by supervision missions and during periodic&#13;
financial audits. The minimum amount for a direct payment request on the loan account&#13;
will be the equivalent of US$100,000.&#13;
IV. ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT AND AUDIT&#13;
57.   Responsibility for accounts management for the project will be assigned to a local&#13;
accountant acceptable to the IBRD. This full-time accountant will keep the books and&#13;
accounts and, in accordance with international accounting standards and practices, will&#13;
duly reflect the project activities, resources, expenditures, and net worth position. A&#13;
procedures manual, and a computerized accounting and assets management system will&#13;
be prepared, maintained, and used.&#13;
58.   The project executing agency (Privatization Committee) will furnish interim and&#13;
annual financial reports reflecting the project's position and progress. These reports&#13;
should include the annual and total cost of the project, as well as the sources of financing.&#13;
59.   Signature of a three-year audit contract with a qualified audit firm acceptable to&#13;
the IBRD will be a condition for making the credit effective. During the appraisal&#13;
mission, agreement was reached on the following points:&#13;
(a)   To have the project's accounting documents and accounts audited by an&#13;
independent auditor accepted by the IBRD, pursuant to international audit&#13;
principles;&#13;
(b)   To provide the IBRD with an audit report for the fiscal year in question,&#13;
certified by the auditor, no later than six months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year;&#13;
(c)   To provide the IBRD with any other information regarding project&#13;
accounting documents, accounts, and audit it may request from time to&#13;
time; and&#13;
(d)   Without detriment to paragraphs (a) to (c) above, have the accounting&#13;
records of the special account, the project account, and the expenditure&#13;
statements audited in accordance with the procedures defined in the&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
preceding paragraphs (a) to (c): (i) every four months during the first&#13;
twelve months counting from the effective date and (ii) every six months&#13;
during the second twelve-month period, counting from the effective date,&#13;
and send these audits to the IBRD no later than two months following the&#13;
end of the audited period.&#13;
60.   For all expenditures for which withdrawals from the loan account were based on&#13;
expenditure statements, the borrower will do as follows:&#13;
(a)   Keep accounting documents and the related accounts;&#13;
(b)   For at least one year after the IBRD receives the audit report for the fiscal&#13;
period in which the last withdrawal from the loan account or the last&#13;
payment from the special account was made, keep all accounting&#13;
documents, including contracts, purchase orders, invoices, receipts, or&#13;
others relating to such expenditures;&#13;
(c)   Allow any IBRD representative to examine these documents; and&#13;
(d)  Have the account records and expenditure statements audited in accordance&#13;
with the procedures defined in the preceding paragraphs and ensure that the&#13;
report of these audits contains the auditor's specific opinion as to the&#13;
reliability of the expenditure statements submitted during the period under&#13;
review, as well as the internal control procedures used in preparing them to&#13;
support the withdrawals made.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SECTION D. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
I.    PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
61.   The Minister of Finance, Economy, Budget, and Shareholdings is the official&#13;
responsible for implementing the project.  Management of the loan and technical&#13;
guidance of privatization operations are the purview of the Privatization Committee&#13;
headed by a secretary, whose responsibility extends to all the components and all stages&#13;
of the project. To fulfill its mission effectively, the Privatization Committee will hire a&#13;
team of qualified nationals consisting of professionals in charge of operations--financial&#13;
analysts, economists, sectoral engineers or technicians and attorneys--and an accounts&#13;
manager, an administrative assistant, and a support person. The Privatization Committee&#13;
will also rely on the enterprises and sectoral ministries, and on one consulting firm for&#13;
advice on privatization and on another specializing in communications. The two resident&#13;
experts provided by these firms will work in close cooperation. Their primary function&#13;
will be to train and develop the capacity of the staff of the Privatization Committee. The&#13;
institutional plan for implementing this project, discussed and agreed with the&#13;
Government, is presented in Annex IX.&#13;
II.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
62.   A project implementation plan was drawn up with the assistance of a project&#13;
computer specialist (Annex VII). This plan will be used by the Project Coordinator and&#13;
by the heads of the various components as a tool for monitoring the project, and by the&#13;
Government and donors for monitoring the reforms. The plan observes all the IBRD&#13;
procedures, and time and resource constraints, and it makes it possible to draw up&#13;
periodic progress reports. It also reflects the action already taken by the Government.&#13;
The project will be implemented over a 48-month period, starting on the date it takes&#13;
effect, scheduled for June 30, 1997. The project will be completed by June 30, 2001.&#13;
III. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
63.   Every six months, starting on the date the loan takes effect, the Project&#13;
Coordinator will send the IBRD a detailed project implementation report. This report&#13;
will show the status of each privatization and liquidation process, and the status of each&#13;
of the other project components. It will highlight current or potential difficulties and&#13;
constraints that could hamper the progress of activities under the project and achievement&#13;
of the project objectives. It will indicate the corrective actions or measures envisaged by&#13;
the Government.  To indicate that a process has been effectively completed, the&#13;
consultant's report, the results of the account audit, and the auditor's certificate must be&#13;
provided. Finally, the report will include a financial statement of project expenditures by&#13;
component, a list and the subject of the contracts concluded during the period, and an&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
indication as to the extent to which the financial and legal obligations of the loan&#13;
agreement have been met.&#13;
64.   At the end of each quarter of the calendar year, beginning on the date the loan&#13;
takes effect, the Project Coordinator will submit to the IBRD a summary progress report,&#13;
with the computer support. This report will give information on implementation and the&#13;
progress made in realizing the structural reforms during the past quarter. The borrower&#13;
will submit a project completion report to the IBRD no later than six months following&#13;
the closing date of the loan.&#13;
IV. SUPERVISION&#13;
65.   In view of the diversity of the sectors and fields covered by the project, the IBRD&#13;
will make contributions to the following specialized areas:  regulatory system,&#13;
privatization, telecommunications, finance, agro-economics, power, communications,&#13;
procurement, and legal affairs. Project supervision will take the following form:&#13;
For the IBRD&#13;
(a)   Evaluation at headquarters based on procurement documents, terms of&#13;
reference, study report, financial audits and analysis, prequalification&#13;
documents, privatization documents, and laws; and&#13;
(b)   On-site missions to evaluate progress and results of technical assistance,&#13;
studies, the privatization process, and implementing of other project&#13;
components, and especially the status of structural reforms (Annex X).&#13;
For the Government&#13;
(a)   Sectoral units consisting of representatives designated by technical&#13;
ministries, members of the Privatization Committee, and a task manager&#13;
for each area will ensure regular monitoring of each component and will&#13;
provide periodic progress reports; and&#13;
(b)   The project coordinator and the component leaders will use the Project&#13;
management software to ensure planned management of project activities&#13;
and results.&#13;
66.   Annex XII presents the performance indicators that will be used for monitoring&#13;
the progress of each component.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V.   PROJECT REVIEW&#13;
67.   The first project review will be carried out by the Government and the IBRD&#13;
during the second quarter of 1998. The purpose of this review will be to determine the&#13;
following: (a) achievement of the objectives and the results of the project, in comparison&#13;
with the initial objectives and the agreed performance indicators; (b) the implementation&#13;
of privatization plans; (c) the implementation of reforms to liberalize the economy; and&#13;
(d) consultants' performance. The review will give the IBRD an opportunity to assess the&#13;
Government's commitment to pursuing the project objectives and the economic structural&#13;
reforms.&#13;

            Gabon - Privatization and Regulatory
            Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the
            Privatization and Regulatory Capacity Building Technical
            Assistance Project is to increase the level of private
            sector investment in Gabon. The current program calls for:
            (a) facilitating rapid divestiture from state enterprises
            with major spin-off effects on factor costs and employment,
            in transport, power, telecommunications, and the largest
            agro-businesses; and (b) improving the efficiency of state
            spending in core areas directly aimed at poverty reduction.
            The project has five components: (1) Public understanding
            and support of the reform program -obtained by: (a) setting
            up and operating an information unit; (b) building
            government capacity to use the media effectively and
            establishing contacts with influential constituencies; (c)
            researching public opinion; and (d) training journalists on
            reporting economic and governance issues. (2) Regulatory
            framework and capacity building -financing (a) a regulatory
            agency for the infrastructure subsectors; (b) implementing
            regulations and laws to attract private investment; and (c)
            the training of regulatory agency staff. (3) Privatizing
            selected large public enterprises in priority sectors with
            financing for consultant and advisory services. (4)
            Increasing local participation in privatization -preparing
            to sell the government's minority shares by: (a)
            drafting regulations on financial markets, trading
            activities, and financial intermediaries; and (b) passing
            laws to establish and regulate mutual funds; and (c)
            updating current laws on securities issuance. (5) Improving
            the business environment and promoting investment -by
            financing (a) computerizing legal texts; (b) repealing,
            amending, updating, or enacting applicable business laws;
            (c) reviewing existing and alternative business dispute
            resolution mechanisms; (d) revising the Labor Code; and (e)
            auditing and financially restructuring the national social
            security agency.
