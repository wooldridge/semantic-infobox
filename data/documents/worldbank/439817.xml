THE POLITICAL MARKET FOR PROTECTION IN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES:&#13;
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE&#13;
This work-in-progress report is part of an inquiry being undertaken&#13;
by the World Bank in conjunction with scholars from twelve industrial countries&#13;
into the penetration of the markets of industrial countries by exports of&#13;
manufactures from developing countries. The project seeks to establish the&#13;
shares of industrial country markets held by the developing countries, changes&#13;
in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among industry groups and&#13;
countries. The aim is to assist developing and industrial countries to&#13;
improve their policies through a better understanding of trade patterns and&#13;
protectionist pressures.&#13;
This paper applies the emerging economic theory of politics to&#13;
the questions of why some industrial country industries are more protected&#13;
than others and what triggers changes in the structure of protection. It&#13;
first integrates and extends somewhat the theory of the political market for&#13;
protection, from which various determinants of the incentives for interest&#13;
groups to demand protection and for governments to supply protection are&#13;
suggested. The paper then draws on a number of new empirical studies to show&#13;
that the statistical evidence generally supports the theory.   It suggests&#13;
that high barriers to imports of traditional labor-intensive manufactures&#13;
should be expected to prevail in industrial democracies and to be raised when&#13;
increased import penetration is coupled with a poor domestic performance in&#13;
terms of employment or output growth. The paper concludes by suggesting that&#13;
this should not necessarily drive developing countries to export pessimism.&#13;
Rather, newly industrializing countries could attempt to raise the political&#13;
cost of protection by pressuring developing countries directly and through the&#13;
CATT and could diversify their manufacturing exports by also producing new&#13;
labor-in'tensive products which do not compete with long established industries&#13;
in developed countries.&#13;
The authors are grateful to project participants for revising their&#13;
results so as to make them more comparable internationally, and to&#13;
Stephen Magee and other participants at the World Bank Workshop on Market&#13;
Penetration by LDC Manufacturers into Industrial Countries, Brussels,&#13;
November 14-16, 1980 for their helpful comments on an earlier draft. Of course,&#13;
the authors take responsibility for remaining errors in interpretation.&#13;

THE POLITICAL MARKET FOR PROTECTION IN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES:&#13;
NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE&#13;
During 1979-80 the World Bank commissioned a series of studies to&#13;
determine the causes of recent changes in import protection in industrial&#13;
countries and their effects in manufactured exports from developing&#13;
V           countries.  As part of that research, participants attempted to explain&#13;
the structure of protection in various industrial countries, and changes&#13;
to that structure, in terms of political as well as economic factors. /1&#13;
The purpose of the present paper is to integrate and extend somewhat the&#13;
theory underlying these studies and then to briefly survey the new empirical&#13;
results as well as other recently published studies on the subject in order&#13;
to see how well they support the theory and what conclusions can be drawn&#13;
from them as a collective. /2   In the theoretical section, various determinants&#13;
of the incentives for interest groups to demand protection and for governments&#13;
to supply protection are suggested on a priori grounds. The empirical section&#13;
/1   This research builds on a number of recent studies by trade economists&#13;
including Pincus (1972, 1975), McPherson (1972), Baldwin (1976), Fieleke (1976),&#13;
Brock and Magee (1978, 1979), Magee (1980), and Ray (1979) for the United States;&#13;
Caves (1976), Helleiner (1977) and Saunders (1980) for Canada; and Anderson (1978)&#13;
and Conybeare (1978) for Australia.   This list represents but one strand of a&#13;
growing interest by economists in 'public choice' or the economics of political&#13;
decisions (Mueller, 1976). Earlier tariff discussions in a similar tradition&#13;
include Cairnes (1874) and Kindleberger (1951).&#13;
/2   The new results are to be published in a forthcoming series of World&#13;
Bank monographs on Industrial Country Protection and the Developing countries.&#13;
Papers are currently available for Australia (Anderson, 1979, 1980; Anderson&#13;
and Snape, 1980); Belgium (Tharakan, 1980); Japan (Shouda, 1980); The Netherlands&#13;
(Koekkoek, Kol and Mennes, 1980); Sweden (Lundberg, 1980); the United Kingdom&#13;
(Cable and Rebelo, 1980); the United States (Baldwin, 1980) and the Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany (Glismann and Weiss, 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
then looks at how well these factors explain both the structure of protection&#13;
in various industrial countries and changes in those protective patterns over&#13;
recent years.   The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some implications&#13;
of the findings for developing countries.&#13;
I.   THE THEORY&#13;
A.   General Outline&#13;
One of the strongest conclusions following from neoclassical trade&#13;
theory is that protection of domestic industries from import competition&#13;
generally lowers average income in a country unless that country's trade&#13;
volume is so large that changes in it affect international prices.   Why,&#13;
then, is protection so pervasive?   Is it simply that the government is&#13;
reflecting the community's preference for protecting certain industries so&#13;
as to maintain employment in those otherwise declining industries or for&#13;
some other 'non-economic' reason? /3   Or is it because some individuals and&#13;
groups in society are more politically powerful than others and so are able&#13;
to influence policies in their favor despite the undesired cost to the&#13;
rest of the community?&#13;
A useful way of sorting out the determinants of protection (and&#13;
other forms of government assistance) in a democracy is to think of a political&#13;
market for protection policies in which import-competing producers are the&#13;
demanders of protection and the government is the supplier (Buchanan and&#13;
/3   The term 'non-economic' as used by Bhagwati (1971) refers to objectives&#13;
other than maximizing national income. Public support for protection as a&#13;
form of social insurance against severe income and employment losses for an&#13;
industry fits this definition.   Specifically, if a society is strongly risk&#13;
averse and faces uncertain terms of trade, a degree of trade restriction may&#13;
improve welfare even though it lowers average income (Jabara and Thompson, 1980).&#13;
Other 'non-economic' reasons for protection, most of which are cited by&#13;
Johnson (1960), include a collective desire to provide for such goals as&#13;
industrialization, self-sufficiency, a particular 'way of life,' military&#13;
preparedness, and an 'equitable' distribution of income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Tullock, 1968; Breton, 1974; Anderson, 1978).   Import-competing producers&#13;
are demanders of protection because restricting trade by means, for example,&#13;
of a tariff increases the producer surplus occurring to firms in the industry. /h&#13;
Consequently, these producers not only exert political pressure through the&#13;
ballot box, but also are prepared to utilize part of the expected increase in&#13;
income to influence other voters to support protectionist actions as well&#13;
as legislators who are willing to supply import protection. Such activities&#13;
are effective because knowledge about the economy is both imperfect and&#13;
costly to acquire.&#13;
The legislative and executive branches of government supply import&#13;
protection or other forms of assistance by enacting or implementing trade-&#13;
related laws.   In reaching their decisions, these officials are assumed to&#13;
be motivated ultimately by the desire to remain in office, and they balance&#13;
the political pressures .for and against protection with this goal in mind.&#13;
Those who tend to oppose higher import restrictions in a particular industry&#13;
are consumers of the industry's product, who suffer a reduction in consumer&#13;
surplus as the price of the item rises, firms who utilize the product as&#13;
an intermediate input into their productive processes, and exporters and&#13;
foreign investors who fear retaliation by other countries against their&#13;
products. As the tariff rises these groups manifest their opposition, like&#13;
the demanders of protection, by threatening to vote against elected officials&#13;
/A   It is assumed that workers and management base their attitudes toward&#13;
protection primarily on the associated short-run changes in income and,&#13;
moreover, that both groups benefit from protection in the short-run.&#13;
Increasing the degree of protection increases producer surplus until the&#13;
level of protection reaches the point where imports cease.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
and by providing funds for lobbying efforts against the trade restrictions.&#13;
However, even though consumer surplus losses due to Itariff increments exceed&#13;
the producer surplus gains, the existence of large numbers of consumers over&#13;
which these losses are usually spread, coupled with the high costs of&#13;
organizing such large groups, usually prevents lobbying activities by&#13;
consumers from being very effective.   Opposition from exporters and foreign&#13;
investors to protection for a particular industry is also likely to be weak,&#13;
since the likelihood of any particular exporter or investor being hurt by&#13;
retaliatory actions by a foreign government is very small. Consequently,&#13;
the industry seeking protection can -- up to a point -- offset this opposition&#13;
either by spending sufficient funds to elicit sympathy for the industry's&#13;
case on some 'non-economic' grounds or by providing elected officials (or&#13;
candidates competing for elective office) with campaign funds to persuade&#13;
voters that they merit election.   In other words, up to some level of&#13;
protection there exists a level of lobbying expenditures that will induce&#13;
elected officials to supply any particular tariff increase./5&#13;
If an industry is able to secure sufficient lobbying funds from its&#13;
members, it will select the level of lobbying expenditures which yields the&#13;
degree of protection that maximizes the difference between its producer surplus&#13;
gains and the costs of lobbying.  In other words, an industry seeking protection&#13;
tends to invest in lobbying activities up to the point where the marginal&#13;
cost of further lobbying equals the marginal gains from influencing policies&#13;
/5   It is assumed that these costs of protection increase at an increasing&#13;
rate as the level of protection rises until some level is reached beyond&#13;
which no outlay will be sufficient to offset the opposition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in their favor. Opposition to protection and the difficulties of organizing&#13;
an industry may be so great in many cases that lobbying is not profitable,&#13;
but there are also likely to be many instances where this activity is&#13;
worthwhile and particular industries are able to secure protection despite&#13;
its adverse effect on national income.&#13;
While the various factors determining the demand for and supply of&#13;
protection are stable, an equilibrium inter-industry structure and average&#13;
level of protection prevails.   Changes in any of these factors, on the&#13;
other hand, lead to changes in the structure and level of protection.&#13;
Since this paper is concerned primarily with explaining the structure rather&#13;
than level of protection, it is necessary to examine the various factors&#13;
that determine the nature of the demand and supply forces determining a&#13;
particular structure of industry protection.&#13;
B.   Inter-Industry Differences in the Demand for Protection&#13;
One important factor on the demand side concerns the ability of an&#13;
industry to organize its members and obtain the voluntary financial contri-&#13;
butions needed for effective lobbying.   Even though additional industry&#13;
benefits from further protection may exceed the additional costs of this&#13;
protection, an industry might not be able to raise the funds to pay these&#13;
additional costs because of the free-rider problem of collective action.&#13;
Mancur Olson (1965) points out that the free-rider problems seriously&#13;
undermines the incentive for a rational, self-interested person to contribute&#13;
to his interest group's seeking of a policy which, if adopted, would benefit&#13;
that individual regardless of whether he contributed. However, he argues&#13;
that the problem is likely to be less serious if the number of members in the&#13;
group is small and the benefits of the group's actions are unevenly distributed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Thus, one tends to expect an industry's rate of protection to be greater,&#13;
the smaller the number of firms in the ind.ustry, since with a given expected&#13;
industry gain in producer surplus the benefits per firm rise as the number&#13;
of firms decreases. One also expects to find mainly larger firms represented&#13;
in an industry's lobbying group(s), because for small firms the cost of&#13;
belonging may exceed the benefits they expect from the group's activities./6&#13;
The expected benefits to larger firms, on the other hand, may be so great in&#13;
absolute terms that it pays them to bear most or all of the costs of&#13;
lobbying, even though part of the benefits from their efforts would be shared&#13;
by many smaller firms. /7   This suggests that the rate of assistance to an&#13;
industry will tend to be greater, the more concentrated the industry's output&#13;
as measured by the share of output produced by the largest few firms.&#13;
However, Olson also points out a reason why these relationships may not hold.&#13;
/6   As noted previously, this point coupled with the preceding one&#13;
concerning large numbers, explains why consumers usually are not organized&#13;
effectively to oppose protection.&#13;
/7 This is not to say that small firms would not be at least nominal members&#13;
of their industry group, for membership may entitle them to some private&#13;
benefits such as discounts on merchandise, journal subscriptions, or whatever.&#13;
Indeed, such benefits may be subsidized by large firms in an attempt to boost&#13;
mecibership numbers.  These numnbers could then be used in lrobbying as apparent&#13;
evidence of wide industry support for any policy being sought by the group.&#13;
In addition, even a small menbership fee from a large number of firms can&#13;
amount to a sizeable lobbying budget, and may ena'ble ecorlomies of scale in&#13;
providing members with pri-ate bernefits such as an in.dustrial Journal   And as&#13;
Stigler (1974) has suggested. if smaller firms are more specialized, they may&#13;
feel their particular interests would not be best served uLnless they contribute&#13;
to the group's activity (or, if large firms make their own representation,&#13;
unless the-y form a smal-firms group), so adding to the demand for assistance&#13;
to concentrated industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Many interest groups produce private goods, e.g., magazines or journals that&#13;
provide useful technical information to their members, and collect funds for&#13;
lobbying purposes from the sale of these goods. Consequently, even though&#13;
there are many small firms in an industry and the level of seller concentration&#13;
is low, the industry may be well organized for this reason. Geographic&#13;
concentration is another variable whose relationship to levels of protection&#13;
is not clear. Pincus (1975) argues that one should expect geographic&#13;
concentration to be positively related to protection levels, since greater&#13;
geographic concentration improves the ability of an industry to coordinate&#13;
and monitor lobbying efforts. On the other hand, Brock and Magee (1974)&#13;
maintain that geographically dispersed industries will be more effective&#13;
politically because they will be able to influence a larger number of&#13;
elected representatives.&#13;
Olson (1979) also points out that, when a new common interest&#13;
emerges for a group, a lobbying organization may not be formed immediately or,&#13;
if in existence, resources may not be forthcoming in significant amounts from&#13;
the group's members. A crisis or repeated series of crises may be necessary&#13;
to shock the individual members sufficiently to form a lobbying organization&#13;
or increase their contributions to an existing organization. Sustained&#13;
periods of potential negative growth and potential rapid increases in import&#13;
penetration levels in the absence of rising protection would be indicators&#13;
of such crises.&#13;
It can be shown that, provided the supply of labor is more elastic&#13;
than that of capital, protection will boost incomes of the industry's workers&#13;
and capital owners relatively more, the more labor-intensive the industry and&#13;
the less important the industry's products in the consumption bundle of those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
workers (Anderson, 1980 Appendix).   urthermore, the benefits to factory&#13;
owners from a rise in the price of an industry's output will be relatively&#13;
greater, the smaller the value-added share of output.   These relationships,&#13;
i.e., a higher labor-intensity and a smaller value-added share, are likely&#13;
to make workers and managers more willing to contribute to lobbying&#13;
organizations in their industry.&#13;
The absolute magnitude of benefits (in the sense of losses foregone)&#13;
from protection to an industry's owners are larger if the industry is under&#13;
pressure to decline. This is because, if wages are sticky downwards,&#13;
capitalists have to bear the brunt of any declining profitability. Moreover,&#13;
if the industry succeeds in obtaining sufficient protection only to maintain&#13;
the status quo, there are no new firms attracted to the industry with whom&#13;
these rents would have to be shared. Losses in a declining industry may,&#13;
however, be reduced if firms in the industry also manufacture products of&#13;
other sectors and are able to shift some of their excess stock of capital goods&#13;
into these other product lines. Workers also have an incentive to add to&#13;
management's demand for protection because, if the assistance is not forthcoming&#13;
and the industry declines substantially, many of them would lose their jobs.&#13;
They would then be faced with the costly process (in psychic as well as&#13;
economic terms) of temporary unemployment, of finding another job, and of&#13;
transferring to another industry for a job which perhaps makes less use of&#13;
their specific skills and so pays a lower wage than they previously enjoyed.&#13;
Their income losses are likely to continue longer, the higher the unemployment&#13;
rate in the economy; and they are less likely to be recovered in the future,&#13;
-the older the employees. Of course, if industries under pressure to decline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
have been successful in securing sufficient direct assistance increases over&#13;
time to maintain the status quo, the expected negative relationship between&#13;
the change in employment in an industry and its rate of protection will be&#13;
weakened.&#13;
Two characteristics that tend to reduce an industry's benefits&#13;
from additional protection are increases in the ratio of exports to production&#13;
and in the ratio of foreign investment to total investment.   For export-&#13;
oriented industries the expected gains from greater protection may be more&#13;
than offset by the increased probability of foreign retaliation against the&#13;
exports of these industries. Similarly, if a firm's overseas subsidiaries&#13;
export back to the home country, a rise in import duties will lower the&#13;
profits of these companies. However, in this case the industry's domestic&#13;
workers will still favor greater protection from imports.&#13;
The magnitude of the factor benefits from a given increase in the&#13;
degree of an industry's protection is also affected by the elasticity of demand&#13;
for the product (provided foreign supply is not infinitely elastic) as well&#13;
as the foreign supply elasticity. As Ray (1980) has shown, the profitability&#13;
of protection will be negatively related to the absolute demand elasticity and&#13;
positively to the foreign supply elasticity. In effect, the less responsive&#13;
are consumers to price changes induced by protection and the more responsive&#13;
are foreign suppliers, the more profitable will be a given increase in the&#13;
degree of protection. /8&#13;
/8   If the foreign supply curve is infinitely elastic, as is usually&#13;
assumed, the domestic price always rises by the degree to which the tariff&#13;
is increased and the demand elasticity will be irrelevant as long as some&#13;
importation continues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
C.   The Supply of Protection&#13;
So much for the demand side of this model of the political market&#13;
for protection. The supply side is influenced by factors affecting the costs&#13;
to the government of providing an industry with protection. Following&#13;
Downs (1957), we assume that voters and their elected representatives pursue&#13;
their own self-interest in the political marketplace just as they do in the&#13;
economic marketplace. The costs of protecting an industry may be low or&#13;
even negative at some levels of protection if for some non-economic reason&#13;
consumers-cum-taxpayers do not mind assisting that industry and/or do not&#13;
realize that more efficient assistance instruments than import barriers are&#13;
available. /9   But more frequently costs will be positive and they always&#13;
rise as protection increases. They include the loss of votes and financial&#13;
support from consumers-cum-taxpayers and from members of other industries&#13;
who are affected adversely by the policy. As noted previously, they can be&#13;
measured by the level of campaign and informational expenditures required to&#13;
offset the loss of political support associated with a particular level of&#13;
protection. The less the government's popular support, the more carefully&#13;
it would have to weigh those costs against the political benefits obtainable&#13;
from supplying protection.&#13;
Since it is always possible for a small country to gain enough from&#13;
a move towards free trade to compensate any losers from that move, why do&#13;
governments supply protection policies rather than rely on more general&#13;
welfare re-distribution and regional assistance policies, assuming reduced&#13;
/9   A more formal discussion of this possibility in terms of a social&#13;
welfare function is provided in Baldwin (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
import dependence per se is not the objective being sought?   One reason is&#13;
that, given the free-rider problem of collective action, it may be uneconomic&#13;
for an individual consumer or taxpayer to become informed, organize and&#13;
contribute financially towards an anti-protection lobby. Another is that&#13;
taxpayers are likely to be more opposed to an assistance policy which is&#13;
listed in the budget each year as depleting treasury funds than to one which&#13;
requires no outlay (import quotas) or brings in revenue (import and export&#13;
taxes).   Thus one might expect a bias in assistance policies towards import-&#13;
competing industries and against exporting industries. To the extent that&#13;
this occurs, however, the statistical relationships between assistance and&#13;
import and export penetration ratios would be weakened.&#13;
If an industry is allowed to decline, then so too does the&#13;
governmerLt's campaign contributions and voting support from that industry. A&#13;
growing industry, on the other hand, is not necessarily going to expand its&#13;
political contributions over time, especially if it is growing in spite of&#13;
rather than because of government policies. /10 Therefore, a government is&#13;
likely to assist at least those declining industries that are significant&#13;
party supporters. (Politically inactive declining industries, however, are&#13;
more likely to be left to decline, as witnessed for example by the gradual&#13;
disappearance of corner butchers and grocers in industrial countries.)&#13;
Obviously, the larger the industry (and those other industries that are major&#13;
input suppliers) in terms of voting numbers and financial lobbying support,&#13;
the more likely is it that the industry will receive assistance from the&#13;
government.   Assistance to a declining industry can also be justified to the&#13;
/10 The explanation for this assistance bias toward declining industries&#13;
is elaborated on by Peltzman (1976, pages 222-26) using a formal model of&#13;
price regulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
public as being a social welfare measure -- especially if rapid change itself&#13;
if seen as undesirable, in which case more efficient adjustment policies&#13;
would have less appeal than policies that are believed to slow the pace of&#13;
structural change. Such justification on welfare grounds would be even&#13;
easier if the industry employed many low-wage workers whose lack of skills&#13;
or non-metropolitan locatioi. make alternative employment difficult to obtain.&#13;
So one would expect more aosistance to a declining industry, the larger the&#13;
number of employees in the industry and the lower their average wage. In&#13;
addition, if nationalism or xenophobia is strong, there may be less opposition&#13;
to assisting a declining industry if its problems were due to -- or at least&#13;
perceived to be due to -- increased import competition or deteriorating&#13;
export markets rather than to presumably more predictable domestic factors.&#13;
For this reason, industries isolated from foreign competitors because of high&#13;
transport costs are likely to receive less government assistance, ceteris&#13;
paribus. Thus one might expect rates of assistance to be negatively related&#13;
to a dummy variable identifying those resource-based industries -- processors&#13;
of food, timber and minerals -- that receive natural protection because of&#13;
the transport costs associated with exporting the locally available raw&#13;
materials.&#13;
On the other hand, voters are much more likely to disapprove of&#13;
assistance to industries that are not seen to be in serious difficulties.&#13;
If, for example, highly-concentrated industries are concentrated because&#13;
they have a few very efficient firms (the natural monopoly theory), one would&#13;
expect them to get a less-than-sympathetic hearing from the public. The&#13;
political costs to the government of assisting such industries would&#13;
therefore tend to be higher than those of assisting declining industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
This factor would reduce and may even reverse the earlier-mentioned expectation&#13;
of positive relationship between assistance and industry concentration.&#13;
The differential consumer effects of protecting different products&#13;
is another set of factors affecting the nature of the costs of protection.&#13;
For example, if the demand for an item is highly inelastic, e.g. it is a&#13;
'necessity', the political costs are likely to rise more rapidly than if&#13;
consumers can easily shift to substitute products or if the burden of the&#13;
price increase did not fall disproportionately on low income earners.&#13;
Similarly-, if expenditures on a product constitute a significant part of&#13;
consumer budgets or represent a major input cost to many other producers, /11&#13;
users may organize more readily into groups opposing protection. Finally&#13;
on the supply side, the more marginal the electorates in which an industry&#13;
is located and the more significant that industry in those electorates, the&#13;
more incentive the government has to assist that industry, ceteris paribus.&#13;
Thus geographically-concentrated industries which may directly employ only&#13;
a handfuL of people need not necessarily be assisted lightly (Pincus, 1975),&#13;
especial:Ly since the possibilities of 'log-rolling' amongst politicians in&#13;
the party room or in Cabinet helps to offset the disadvantage of supplying&#13;
few votes (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962, Chapter 10). Also, being geographically&#13;
concentrated makes it cheaper for producers to organize a lobby group (corner&#13;
butcher and grocery stores providing examples of the converse), and being&#13;
small ensures that assistance to such an industry will have little effect on&#13;
others and hence will stimulate little opposition.&#13;
/11 The potential opposition from other producers using the item as a&#13;
major input is often offset by tying tariff increases on their product&#13;
to a rise in protection of the supplying industry or, if they are exporters,&#13;
by exempting them from tariffs on inputs used to produce exports.&#13;

D.   Summary&#13;
To summarize, the preceding discussion suggests that, other things&#13;
being equal, an industry is likely to receive a higher rate of protection,&#13;
(1) the fewer the number of firms -n the industry, (2) the more concentrated&#13;
the share of output among the largest (say) four enterprises, (3) the lower&#13;
the rate of growth in either output or employment terms, (4) the more rapid&#13;
the rise in the import penetration level (and, perhaps, the higher this level),&#13;
(5) the more labor-intensive the industry, (6) the smaller its value-added&#13;
share of output, (7) the lower the average wage or average skill level of&#13;
employees in the industry, (8) the higher the average age of employees and&#13;
the greater the degree of industry specialization, if an industry is declining,&#13;
(9) the larger the industry in employment and financial terms, (10) the&#13;
larger and more concentrated the industries that are input suppliers compared&#13;
with industries that use the output as inputs, (11) the less important the&#13;
product in the budgets of users, (12) the smaller the share of output exported&#13;
and the less significant the extent of foreign investment, and (13) the lower&#13;
the natural resource protection provided by transport costs. The expected&#13;
signs for the number of firms and the seller concentration variable are in&#13;
doubt, however, as is the sign on the elasticity of product demand.&#13;
The above discussion also suggests that, if there were disruptions                a&#13;
in the political market for protection, then among the industries affected it&#13;
would be those whose characteristics had the above tendencies at the time&#13;
of disruption which would be likely to receive the largest assistance bcosts&#13;
subsequently.  A number of disruptions have in fact occurred in the 1970s,&#13;
most notably the recessioDn and the rapid increase in exports from developing&#13;
ccuntries5 of labor-intensive manufactured goods, which have adversely affected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
the low-wage, labor-intensive industries of industrial countries in recent&#13;
years. The industrial countries also engaged in a major multilateral tariff-&#13;
reducing negotiation, the so-called Tokyo Round of multilateral trade&#13;
negotiations. The extent to which different industries were able to moderate&#13;
these duty reductions should be related to the same variables that were&#13;
analyzed in the preceding discussion.&#13;
In trying to derive tests of these hypotheses, a number of problems&#13;
of interpretation arise. For example, might average wages and labor-intensity&#13;
(the ratio of which is value-added per employee) and the value-added share&#13;
of output have the signs suggested simply because they together provide an&#13;
index of votes per dollar of output, so supporting Caves' (1976) 'adding&#13;
machine' model rather than the model suggested here?   Do industrial countries&#13;
protect most highly those industries competing with developing country&#13;
imports because these industries happen to be the ones which have relatively&#13;
large incentives to demand assistance and for which the cost of supplying&#13;
assistance is low, or because developing countries are relatively weak&#13;
bargainers in multilateral trade negotiations and so do not raise the foreign&#13;
policy cost of supplying protection as much as other countries (Helleiner, 1977)?&#13;
Should declining industries be expected to be more protected because they are&#13;
declining, or should protected industries be expected to decline because&#13;
they spend relatively more effort on lobbying than in improving their efficiency?&#13;
These questions cannot, unfortunately, be resolved in the following statistical&#13;
analyses, in which ordinary least squares regression is used to see how well&#13;
the above factors are able to explain both the observed cross-sectional&#13;
patterns and the changes to those patterns of protection of the manufacturing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
industries of a number of OECD countries. /12&#13;
Finally, it should be emphasized that the various influences on&#13;
the demand for and supply of protection discussed above do not, of course,&#13;
cover all the forces likely to shape protection in a particular country.&#13;
Many other factors peculiar to a colr.ntry or a group of countries will also&#13;
affect the structure of protection. These include the particular governmental&#13;
form, for example, parliamentary versus federal; the nature of the division&#13;
of responsibility within the government for trade policy; the particular set&#13;
of trade-off relationships among various economic and socia§- goals desired by&#13;
the voters; the special relationships of key government leaders to various&#13;
industries; and various unique combinations of economic and political events.&#13;
For a thorough analysis of protectionism in a specific country during a certain&#13;
time period, the impact of these types of factors on the pattern of government&#13;
assistance would have to be analyzed on an industry by irdustry basis.&#13;
However, the objective of models of protectionism such as the one outlined&#13;
here is to search for general forces affecting protectionism that emerge&#13;
from the workings of representative democracies in an environment of imperfect&#13;
and costly information and that are common to a wide range of special&#13;
institutional and historical circumstances. In other words, the analysis&#13;
seeks to discover general protectionist tendencies based on widely shared&#13;
behavior patterns rather than to explain the precise level of protection&#13;
in any particular industry. It seens reasonable to assLme that the omitted&#13;
variables do not systematically bias the various hypcthesized relationships&#13;
discussed above.&#13;
/12 It is recognized that ordinary least squares may provide biased, incon-&#13;
sistent estimates if the relationships between some of the explanatory variables&#13;
(import penetration, industry employment or output growth) and protection levels&#13;
are interdependent (Rebelo, 1980). However, attempts tc also use two-stage&#13;
least squares to overcome this problem (Lundberg, Saunders, Ray) have not&#13;
resulted in substantially different results.&#13;

II. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE&#13;
Besides presenting new regression results for Belgium, Japan,&#13;
the United Kingdom, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany,&#13;
the Netherlands, and Sweden, the tables in this section also include for&#13;
comparative purposes results from previous studies covering Australia&#13;
(Anderson, 1979, 1980), Canada (Caves, 1976; Helleiner, 1972; and&#13;
Saunders, 1980), the United States (Cheh, 1974) and Federal Republic of&#13;
Germany (Riedel, 1977). With two exceptions, we concentrate on attempts&#13;
to explain differences in effective rates of protection to industries and&#13;
changes in those rates, although only the Australian, Japanese and Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany studies use an endogenous variable which also captures&#13;
protection via non-tariff barriers. The two exceptions are the United Kingdom,&#13;
where a 0-1-2-3 dummy variable was used to indicate the degree of industry&#13;
protection., /13 and the United States, where nominal tariff rates and an&#13;
index of the incidence of non-tariff barriers were each used to explain the&#13;
structure of protection in 1976 and 1970, respectively. One should also note&#13;
that for the EEC countries, the tariff rates on which their protection&#13;
estimates are based are set at the Community rather than the national level.&#13;
Thus the common tariff will be less representative of the outcome of the&#13;
political market for protection in each EEC member country insofar as the&#13;
political forces in those countries differ.&#13;
/13 Cable and Rebelo (1980) recognize that it is more appropriate to use&#13;
nonlinear probability models such as logit or probit rather than regression&#13;
analysis when the endogenous variable is a dummy (see Dhrymes, 1978,&#13;
Chapter 7 and Rebelo, 1980) but they run regression as well for comparative&#13;
purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The first set of results, summarized in Table 1, are concerned with&#13;
explaining the structure of protectio-ni at particular noints in time. Not&#13;
all the variables enumerated in the preceding discussion of the model are&#13;
included. Moreover, all authors used variables in addition to those shown in&#13;
the table, but they were either country-specific or not used by others and so&#13;
have been omitted for the sake of brevity.  A few of the results shown are&#13;
taken from more than one regression equation, hence the rate of adjusted R 2&#13;
and F values in certain cases.&#13;
Overall, the results in Table 1 provide a reasonable degree of&#13;
support for the theory, although the levels of statistical significance are&#13;
often not high and it is not known whether the variables omitted would have&#13;
been significant or had the hypothesized signs on the estimated coefficients.&#13;
With these qualifications in mind, it can be observed that (1) the usually&#13;
positive and significant coefficients for labor's share of value-added (LSH)&#13;
and significantly negative coefficients for average wage per employee (AWPE),&#13;
value-added per employee (VAPE), and value-added share of turnover (VASH)&#13;
confirm that it is the labor-intensive, low-wage industries with low value-&#13;
added shares of output that are most highly protected; (2) industries with&#13;
fewer firms (NOF) and large numbers of employees (NOE) tend to be protected&#13;
more; (3) import-competing industries (IMSH) tend to be more heavily assisted&#13;
than those receiving natural protection via transport costs (TC) or those&#13;
involved in exporting (EXSH); (4) industries whose output is mostly produced&#13;
by a few large firms (so4) tend of-ten to be protected less, suggesting&#13;
perhaps that despite the lower costs of lobbying collectively in oligopolistic&#13;
4ndustries, it may be politically costly to assist such industries overtly; /14&#13;
/14 This result was also reported for the U.S. in McPherson (1972) and&#13;
Stigler (1974).&#13;

and (5) the often insigniricant 8.-d iot iIays ne-Jat ve signs for ch anges&#13;
in employment (DNOE) and ir industry t'xrnover (DTO) may not mean that declining&#13;
industries are not protected more, blut rather that industries that would have&#13;
declined have been more suecessful in obtaining protection boosts than others.&#13;
This leads us to the second set of empirical results, summarized in Table 2,&#13;
which try to explain differing changes in industry protection.&#13;
The results in Table 2 are also generally supportive of the theory.&#13;
Again, they suggest that it is the low-wage, labor-intensive, low value-added,&#13;
declining industries facing strong and growing import competition that are&#13;
receiving the greatest protection boosts over time or the least cuts in&#13;
multilateral tariff-cutting negotiations, just as the theory would suggest.&#13;
In addition, the Australian results in column 2 of Table 2 suggest that,&#13;
even within the group of industries most under pressure to decline, these&#13;
same characteristics continue to distinguish the industries with the greatest&#13;
protection boosts.&#13;

Both the theory and empirical evidence suggest that manufacturers&#13;
in developing countries should expect high barriers to be maintained against&#13;
the importation of traditionally protected labor-intensive manufactures in&#13;
industrial democracies. Moreover, they should anticipate that a rapid rise&#13;
in an industry's level of import penetration, coupled with a poor performance&#13;
in output or employment terms, could trigger import protection in the&#13;
industrial countries for the industry, especially if the number of workers&#13;
that the industry employs is large, its average wage level is relatively low,&#13;
and its import penetration level is already comparatively high.&#13;
These conclusions should not be interpreted, however, as implying&#13;
that the prospects for export-oriented growth by developing countries are&#13;
bleak. As previously noted, the model utilized is incomplete; the exceptions&#13;
one can easily find to the broad relationships discovered between protectionism&#13;
and industry characteristics indicate that other factors can offset these&#13;
tendencies. The development of hypotheses and empirical tests for these&#13;
factors should be a priority research activity in this field. But even the&#13;
limited analytical and empirical framework used here indicates that the&#13;
developing countries can successfully expand exports of manufactures. There&#13;
are numerous labor-intensive manufacturing sectors in the industrial countries&#13;
where demand and output levels are rising rapidly, import penetration ratios&#13;
are still low, and aggregate employment levels are relatively small.&#13;
Consequently, both the economic and political prospects for increasing exports&#13;
in these product lines are favorable. Moreover, as the newly industrializing.&#13;
countries continue to upgrade the quality of their labor force and capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

infrastructure, opportunities open up for exporting goods that require higher&#13;
levels of labor skills and for which demand is rising briskly in the advanced&#13;
industrial nations. Shifts into these manufacturing areas also permits&#13;
the least developed countries to expand their exports of traditional labor-&#13;
intensive products to the industrial countries.&#13;

            The political market for protection in
            industrial countries : empirical evidence
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper applies the emerging economic
            theory of politics to the questions of why some industrial
            country industries are more protected than others and what
            triggers changes in the structure of protection. It first
            integrates and extends somewhat the theory of the political
            market for protection, from which various determinants of
            the incentives for interest groups to demand protection and
            for governments to supply protection are suggested. The
            paper then draws on a number of new empirical studies to
            show that the statistical evidence generally supports the
            theory. It suggests that high barriers to imports of
            traditional labor-intensive manufactures should be expected
            to prevail in industrial democracies and to be raised when
            increased import penetration is coupled with a poor domestic
            performance in terms of employment or output growth. The
            paper concludes by suggesting that this should not
            necessarily drive developing countries to export pessimism.
            Rather, newly industrializing countries could attempt to
            raise the political cost of protection by pressuring
            developing countries directly and through the GATT and could
            diversify their manufacturing exports by also producing new
            labor-intensive products which do not compete with long
            established industries in DCs.
