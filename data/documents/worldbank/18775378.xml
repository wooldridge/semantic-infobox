The MDF-JRF Working Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in&#13;
Indonesia was prepared by the Secretariat of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and&#13;
the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF). The World Bank serves as trustee of both funds. The series,&#13;
consisting of five working papers, was produced under the guidance of Shamima Khan, MDF and&#13;
JRF Manager. Anita Kendrick, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of the MDF and JRF, developed the&#13;
concepts and managed the production of the Working Paper Series and the Knowledge Notes&#13;
based on each paper.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 1 in the series, is entitled Adapting Community Driven Approaches&#13;
for Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia. The paper is based on research and&#13;
background text written by Puteri Natalie Watson and John Victor Bottini, World Bank consultants.&#13;
Shamima Khan provided general guidance, support and oversight of the entire writing and&#13;
production process. Anita Kendrick managed the development and preparation of the paper and&#13;
provided editorial oversight and guidance to the production and content. Scott Guggenheim (Social&#13;
Policy Adviser, AusAID) and Janmejay Singh (Senior Social Development Specialist, World Bank)&#13;
provided useful and extensive comments on the text as peer reviewers. Additional comments were&#13;
provided by Mary Ann Brocklesby and Helen Vanwel, MDF consultants. Sharon Lumbantobing&#13;
guided the production process, and Kate Redmond and Devi Asmarani provided editorial support.&#13;
&#13;
Other members of the MDF/JRF Secretariat team and consultants provided significant inputs to&#13;
the working paper on content, design, layout, and production: Safriza Sofyan, Deputy Manager&#13;
of the MDF, along with Shaun Parker, Akil Abduljalil, Deslly Sorongan, Inge Susilo, Eva Muchtar,&#13;
Inayat Bhagawati, David Lawrence, and Nia Sarinastiti. Olga Lambey and Amenah Smith provided&#13;
administrative support. Ola Santo and her team from Studio Rancang Imaji prepared the design&#13;
and layout of the Working Paper Series and accompanying Knowledge Notes.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF and JRF Secretariat would like to thank the many partners and stakeholders who&#13;
cooperated with the team during the preparation of the paper. These included representatives of&#13;
the Government of Indonesia, including line ministries, as well as local governments of Aceh, North&#13;
Sumatra, Nias, and Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta. In addition, we wish to thank&#13;
donors, partner and implementing agencies, and beneficiary communities in Aceh, Nias, Central&#13;

&amp;#12;THE MDF-JRF WORKING PAPER SERIES&#13;
&#13;
The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) are widely&#13;
recognized as having played a significant role in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias and Java,&#13;
following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia over the last decade.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF and the JRF, which is patterned after it, are each considered a highly successful model&#13;
for post-disaster reconstruction. Key factors in this success have been the leadership provided by&#13;
the Government of Indonesia and the strong partnership of multiple stakeholders in support of&#13;
the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reconstruction agenda. The two programs have produced impressive results,&#13;
both in terms of physical reconstruction, and in the less tangible but equally important benefits&#13;
such as community empowerment, strengthened governance, and communities that are more&#13;
resilient to future disasters. The experiences of the MDF and JRF have generated many useful&#13;
lessons and created effective models and approaches that can be adapted and replicated in other&#13;
reconstruction contexts.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat of the MDF and JRF, as part of its culminating activities, has prepared a series&#13;
of working papers to document these achievements and lessons learned. The MDF-JRF Working&#13;
Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in Indonesia consists of&#13;
five working papers covering five key areas. These are: 1) community driven approaches for&#13;
post-disaster recovery; 2) capacity building in a post-disaster context; 3) reconstruction of&#13;
infrastructure; 4) promoting gender equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment through post-disaster&#13;
reconstruction; and 5) multi-donor trust funds as a framework for effective partnerships for&#13;
reconstruction. Each Working Paper describes the strategy and approaches adopted by the MDF&#13;
and/or JRF across its projects, notes the achievements, and draws lessons that will be useful in&#13;
other post-disaster settings. In addition to the full working papers, a series of Knowledge Notes has&#13;
also been prepared, providing a short summary of the key lessons and conclusions from each of&#13;
the longer working papers.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 1 in the series, is entitled Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia. It presents the lessons from the MDF and&#13;
JRFâ&#128;&#153;s use of large-scale, government-implemented community driven development programs to&#13;
deliver reconstruction at the village level in Aceh, Nias and Java. This paper documents how local-&#13;
level recovery using a community driven approach can result in not only cost effective physical&#13;
outputs, but also empowered communities with greater capacities and more prepared to face&#13;
future disasters. Based on the MDF and JRF experiences, the paper draws lessons and conclusions&#13;
about adapting the community driven approach to reconstruction in other contexts.&#13;
&#13;
Collectively, the lessons and experiences from the MDF and JRF form a legacy of the remarkable&#13;
achievements of these two programs and the effective partnerships on which they were based.&#13;
We hope that the lessons captured in these papers will contribute to future reconstruction and&#13;
preparedness efforts in Indonesia and other disaster-prone countries around the world.&#13;

&#13;
                                     Indonesia is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world. It is vulnerable to earthquakes,&#13;
                                     tsunamis, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires. Between 2004 and 2010 Indonesia&#13;
                                     experienced a series of devastating natural disasters which attracted an outpouring of support&#13;
                                     from around the world.&#13;
&#13;
                                     December 2004â&#128;&#148;Earthquake and Tsunami in Aceh&#13;
&#13;
                                     The earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     region on December 26, 2004 was one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human history.&#13;
                                     The massive earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale was centered in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     about 150 kilometers off the coast of the province of Aceh on the northernmost tip of the island&#13;
                                     of Sumatra. Huge tidal waves fanned across the Indian Ocean, causing death and destruction&#13;
                                     across Southern Asia including Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and as far away as East&#13;
                                     Africa. No country suffered more than Indonesia. Waves towering ten meters high came&#13;
                                     crashing into the shoreline in Aceh. The scale of physical devastation and human suffering was&#13;
                                     enormous. In Aceh alone, 221,000 people were killed or missing, and over a half million were left&#13;
                                     homeless. As many as 750,000 people lost their livelihoods. At all levels, infrastructure was&#13;
                                     paralyzed or completely destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
                                     In minutes, human settlements along the coastline of Aceh and parts of North Sumatra were&#13;
                                     demolished. People, houses, boats, cars, and buildings were engulfed as the tsunami swallowed&#13;
                                     everything in its way. Villages were reduced to rubble where minutes before thriving communities&#13;
                                     had flourished. Many roads, bridges, communications systems, schools, hospitals and clinics&#13;
                                     collapsed or were severely damaged. Fishermen, farmers and others lost their livelihoods and&#13;
                                     many businesses were destroyed or could no longer operate.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The subsequent assessment of the impact of both disasters, conducted by the Government along&#13;
                                     with the World Bank and other partners, assessed the damage and needs to be US$4.9 billion.1 This&#13;
                                     figure was later revised to $6.2 billion.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The massive destruction in Aceh seriously affected provincial and local governments already&#13;
                                     weakened by years of conflict. The tsunami destroyed 21 percent of public buildings and 19 percent&#13;
                                     of the equipment in these buildings. Approximately nine percent of civil servants perished and at&#13;
                                     least 21 percent of surviving civil servants were severely affected, impacting their ability to function&#13;
                                     as a local government. Twenty-seven percent of public records were destroyed. The replacement&#13;
                                     value of these losses was estimated to be over $81 million.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Prior to the tsunami, governance in Aceh already faced numerous challenges, including lack of&#13;
                                     institutional capacity and inefficient delivery of public services such as health and education,&#13;
                                     especially in the rural areas. The tsunami exacerbated these challenges to say the least, and the&#13;

Many people were saved from the tsunami by taking refuge in Acehâ&#128;&#153;s Grand Mosque. They       Photo:&#13;
could only watch helplessly as the torrent raged through the streets, carrying debris and   Antara News&#13;
victims along with it.                                                                      Agency&#13;
&#13;
provincial and local governments were not in a position to manage the immense and extensive&#13;
recovery effort that would be required. The national government stepped in urgently to take the&#13;
lead in the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
March 2005â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in North Sumatra and Aceh&#13;
&#13;
Just three months later on March 28, 2005, another massive earthquake measuring 8.7 on the&#13;
Richter scale struck Aceh and the neighboring province of North Sumatra. This quake devastated&#13;
the Nias islands in the province of North Sumatra, located in the Indian Ocean 130 kilometers off&#13;
the western coast of Sumatra just south of Aceh. The island of Simeulue, part of the province of&#13;
Aceh off the western coast of the mainland, was also hard hit. This second disaster resulted in the&#13;
death of nearly 1,000 people and the displacement of nearly 50,000 survivors. The earthquake&#13;
wreaked more havoc on an already ravaged area. The physical damage was severe. Approximately&#13;
30 percent of buildings were destroyed. The destruction rendered transportation and other critical&#13;
infrastructure inoperative, including the major ports linking the remote island populations with the&#13;
mainland. Nias and Simeulue stood among the poorest areas of Indonesia prior to the disasters and&#13;
were only further isolated by the destruction of the earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
These two disasters devastated two areas of Indonesia that were already grappling with multiple&#13;
challenges. The province of Aceh was in the grip of an internal conflict between the Acehnese&#13;

                                     separatist rebel movement and the Indonesian military. This conflict, stretching over thirty years,&#13;
                                     had paralyzed development and economic growth, and had seriously weakened both public and&#13;
                                     private sector capacities. At the time of the December 2004 tsunami, poverty in Aceh was 28.4&#13;
                                     percent, substantially higher than the national average of 16.7 percent (Aceh Poverty Assessment,&#13;
                                     World Bank: 2008). The districts of Nias and South Nias on Nias Island ranked among the poorest&#13;
                                     districts in Indonesia. Poverty, largely attributable to the isolation of the island, was approximately&#13;
                                     31 percent at the time of the March 2005 earthquake.2 These dual challenges of poverty and&#13;
                                     isolation created an extremely difficult operating environment for reconstruction in Nias.&#13;

                                     The local governments, already weakened by the conflict in Aceh and isolation in Nias, were&#13;
                                     initially overwhelmed by the disasters. Recognizing this, and recognizing the magnitude of the&#13;
                                     reconstruction task at hand, the central government created the Agency for the Reconstruction&#13;
                                     and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (Badan Rekonstruksi dan Rehabilitasi Aceh dan Nias, widely&#13;
                                     known as the BRR) to manage reconstruction. This special agency was based in Aceh and led by a&#13;
                                     minister-level appointee who reported directly to the President.&#13;

May 2006â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in Java&#13;
&#13;
Disaster again struck Indonesia on May 27, 2006, when an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter&#13;
scale hit the island of Java, resulting in extensive damage in the province of Central Java and the&#13;
Special Region of Yogyakarta. The earthquake hit one of the most densely populated areas in Asia,&#13;
claiming more than 5,700 lives and destroying over 280,000 homes. Damage to private houses made&#13;
up more than 60 percent of the total destruction, which also affected small and medium enterprises,&#13;
a large number of them home-based industries. While infrastructure suffered comparatively less&#13;
damage, hundreds of thousands of homes and smaller structures were destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
Many houses in the area had been built without proper reinforcement and with low quality&#13;
building materials, resulting in more deaths and damage than would normally be expected from&#13;
an earthquake of this magnitude. Approximately 40,000 people were injured in the earthquake.&#13;
Thousands of people were trapped and buried beneath their toppled houses and buildings.&#13;
&#13;
A joint team led by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), with local governments&#13;
and the international community, prepared the preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment in order&#13;
to determine the overall needs for the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. Total damage and&#13;
losses from the earthquake were estimated at around $3.1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
The economic impact of the earthquake was particularly heavy because of the concentration of&#13;
home-based industries in the areas destroyed by the earthquake. More than 650,000 workers&#13;
were employed in economic activities directly affected by the earthquake with close to 90 percent&#13;
of damage and losses concentrated in small and medium enterprises. Many of the home-based&#13;
industries in the areaâ&#128;&#153;s important handicraft sector were severely affected. Rebuilding homes&#13;
would also support recovery of home-based businesses and livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
July 2006â&#128;&#148;West Java Tsunami&#13;
&#13;
Just two months later, on July 17, 2006, a second major submarine earthquake struck off the&#13;
southern coast of Java. The earthquake, measuring a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale,&#13;
triggered a tsunami that caused widespread damage. The tsunami hit the south coast of West&#13;
Java, taking more than 650 lives and displacing over 28,000 people. Almost 1,000 people died&#13;
or remained missing and more than 50,000 people were displaced. Damage and losses reached&#13;
an estimated $112 million. Ciamis district, West Java, was the worst affected. Along the coast of&#13;
Ciamis alone, close to 6,000 families were displaced. The tsunami caused economic destruction in&#13;
the fishing villages and tourist resorts along the south coast of West Java, where large numbers of&#13;
fishing boats were lost and the small fishing ports destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
October and November 2010â&#128;&#148;Mount Merapi Volcanic Eruptions&#13;
&#13;
On October 26, 2010, disaster hit Java once again when Mount Merapi, a volcano located on the&#13;
border between Yogyakarta and Central Java, erupted. This was followed by seven additional major&#13;
eruptions, with the last one occurring on November 11, 2010. For two long weeks, the eruptions&#13;

                                     spewed hot gas into nearby villages and hot lava accompanied by hot gas flowed into several&#13;
                                     rivers. The clouds of hot ash and poisonous gas combined with heat clouds at temperatures of 600&#13;
                                     to 800 degrees Celsius incinerated everything they reached, including livestock, crops and trees&#13;
                                     that were essential to the livelihoods of evacuees. Ash rain, which blanketed everything in fine&#13;
                                     volcanic dust, was found in cities across Java. All villages within 20 kilometers of the crater were&#13;
                                     evacuated. Along with massive damage to local infrastructure, approximately 2,900 houses were&#13;
                                     destroyed and 350,000 people were displaced and accommodated in evacuation camps. Due to&#13;
                                     timely evacuation, casualties were limited but still almost 300 people perished and more than 500&#13;
                                     were injured. The eruptions impacted areas in the province of Central Java and the Yogyakarta&#13;
                                     Special Region, including some communities that had been affected by the 2006 earthquake and&#13;
                                     were still in the process of rebuilding.&#13;
&#13;
                                     These eruptions resulted in widespread damage to housing and local infrastructure, as well as&#13;
                                     loss of livelihoods. During the eruptions, volcanic debris mixed with rain flowed down the slopes&#13;
                                     of Mount Merapi as massive mud flows. In Java this is known as â&#128;&#156;lahar dinginâ&#128;&#157; or cold lava and&#13;
                                     is made up of ash and sand from the eruption which when combined with rain turns into thick,&#13;
                                     slushy rivers of mud that gather up everything in the way. Cold lava surged down the mountain&#13;
                                     burying entire villages, farms and fields. Huge boulders, trees, houses, livestock, motor bikes, and&#13;
                                     cars were carried away by the mud. Several villages located in the danger zone near the volcano&#13;
                                     were relocated to safer areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Facing the Future&#13;
&#13;
                                     The numerous disasters since 2004 are a stark reminder that Indonesia is highly prone to natural&#13;
                                     hazards. Improvements in early warning systems are expected to save lives, as will ensuring that&#13;
                                     homes and other structures are built to seismic resistant standards. Many of the homes destroyed&#13;
                                     during the earthquakes were found to have used poor quality materials and building techniques,&#13;
                                     both of which contributed greatly to the number of lives lost and the high level of damage. Through&#13;
                                     the recovery and reconstruction efforts following these disasters, Indonesia has learned many&#13;
                                     lessons. It has created institutions and put systems in place for disaster risk reduction. As a result&#13;
                                     of the recovery and reconstruction process communities across Aceh, Nias, and Java are more&#13;
                                     resilient to face future disasters.&#13;

The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) was established in April 2005, in response to&#13;
the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s request to coordinate donor support for the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of affected areas following the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and the&#13;
subsequent March 2005 earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF pools $655 million in contributions from 15 donors. These funds amount to nearly ten&#13;
percent of the overall reconstruction funds. At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the&#13;
World Bank serves as Trustee of the MDF. Grant funds are provided to projects which are implemented&#13;
by government and non-government agencies and communities, with partner agencies providing&#13;
oversight. Partner agencies include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the&#13;
World Food Programme (WFP), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Under the MDF portfolio, 23 projects were financed in six outcome areas: (1) Recovery of&#13;
Communities; (2) Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Large Infrastructure and Transport; (3)&#13;
Strengthening Governance and Capacity Building; (4) Sustaining the Environment; (5) Enhancing&#13;
the Recovery Process; and (6) Economic Development and Livelihoods. These projects reflected the&#13;
priorities of the Indonesian government throughout the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Agency for&#13;
the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias (BRR), which was set up to manage the&#13;
reconstruction and recovery effort. After the BRR closed in April 2009, the National Development&#13;
Planning Agency, Bappenas, took on this critical role. The MDF is governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
with representatives from the government, donors, the trustee, and civil society. The Steering&#13;
Committee is supported in its work by a secretariat.&#13;

                                           Following a request from the Government of Indonesia, the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) was&#13;
                                           established to respond to the May 27, 2006 earthquake that struck near Yogyakarta, and the&#13;
                                           tsunami that hit the southern coast of West Java Province in July 2006. The JRF was later extended&#13;
                                           to respond to volcanic eruptions of Mount Merapi in October and November of 2010. The JRF&#13;
                                           program closed on December 31, 2012.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF is based on the successful model of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. Seven&#13;
                                           donors supported the JRF with contributions totaling $94.1 million. The donors are: the European&#13;
                                           Union, the Governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, the Asian Development Bank,&#13;
                                           Canada, Finland and Denmark. The World Bank serves as Trustee of the JRF. Following the&#13;
                                           governmentâ&#128;&#153;s priorities, the JRF supports the recovery of communities and livelihoods, and increases&#13;

                                           The JRF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                           National Coordinating Team (NCT) and the National Technical Team (TTN). After the mandate of&#13;
                                           the NCT and the TTN ended in 2008, the JRF worked with the National Planning Agency (Bappenas)&#13;
                                           and the Provincial Planning Agencies (Bappeda) for the overall coordination of the reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Using a governance structure similar to the MDF, the JRF was governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
                                           with representatives from the Government of Indonesia and donors. Bappenas co-chaired the&#13;
                                           Steering Committee, along with the European Union as the largest donor, and the World Bank&#13;
                                           as Trustee. The Steering Committee is supported by a secretariat. Through shared staffing and&#13;
                                           expertise with the MDF for Aceh and Nias, the secretariat achieved efficiencies of scale, resulting in&#13;
                                           reduced program administration costs.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF portfolio consisted of five projects which drew from the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s experience and used a&#13;

                                           Infrastructure; and (3) Restoring Livelihoods. The World Bank had a supervisory and oversight role&#13;

The JRF Portfolio&#13;
&#13;
The JRF portfolio followed a phased approach to reconstruction, adopting lessons learned from&#13;
the MDF. Early support focused on meeting housing and community recovery needs and&#13;
subsequent support focused on addressing economic recovery. The JRF prioritized disaster risk&#13;
reduction in all its programs. Five projects were supported:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Transitional Housing Projects (2 projects totaling $2.3 million). The JRF financed two transitional&#13;
housing projects, implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and&#13;
Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF) International and managed by the World Bank. The projects&#13;
provided nearly 5,000 transitional shelters.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Community-based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (1 project&#13;
totaling $75.1 million), better known as Rekompak, made up most of the JRF funding allocation.&#13;
Following the model established in Aceh, it used a community driven approach to rebuild homes&#13;
and local infrastructure in earthquake affected areas of Yogyakarta Special District, and Central&#13;
Java, and later, parts of West Java affected by a subsequent earthquake and tsunami. After&#13;
the 2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi, the project was expanded further. Implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and managed by the World Bank, the project rebuilt over 15,000&#13;
houses and completed over 4,000 local infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Livelihood Recovery Projects (2 projects totaling $17.1 million):&#13;
   -	The Livelihood Recovery in Yogyakarta Special District and Central Java project&#13;
   contributed to the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives to assist micro, small and medium&#13;
   enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses and re integrate&#13;
   affected low-income communities into economic life. The project provided access to finance,&#13;
   developed loan work-out strategies for defaulting borrowers, restored capacity and improved&#13;
   competitiveness of medium-sized companies in Yogyakarta and Central Java. The project&#13;
   was implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and&#13;
   managed by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  -	 The Access to Finance and Capacity Building for Earthquake Affected Micro             and Small&#13;
  Enterprises project, implemented by the IOM and managed by the World Bank,               supported&#13;
  the recovery of micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta and Central Java               to enable&#13;
  them to reach their pre-earthquake capacity. It provided asset replacement,              marketing&#13;
  support, and techical assistance. The project worked with over 4,000 micro               and small&#13;
  enterprises (MSEs), over 40 percent run or owned by women.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                          Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience following a series of devastating natural disasters between 2004&#13;
                          and 2010 clearly demonstrates the many benefits of using large scale, government-&#13;
                          implemented community driven development programs to deliver reconstruction&#13;
                          at the village level. In addition to tangible results in delivering quality, cost-efficient&#13;
                          physical outputs, the community-based recovery programs implemented in Aceh, Nias&#13;
                          and Java have demonstrated less tangible but exceptionally important social benefits&#13;
                          in extremely challenging circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
                          The evidence from Indonesia shows that community driven approaches can be&#13;
                          adapted effectively for post-disaster reconstruction to deliver cost-effective, equitable&#13;
                          and sustainable local level recovery. The experiences of community recovery projects&#13;
                          implemented under the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java&#13;
                          Reconstruction Fund (JRF) demonstrate that disaster-affected communities are able to&#13;
                          manage reconstruction resources and projects to high-levels of quality and satisfaction&#13;
                          while benefitting from increased confidence and capacities brought by the consultative&#13;
                          and participatory approaches. At the same time, the community driven approach&#13;
                          encouraged faster social recovery and built capacities that will last well beyond&#13;
                          the reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Overview of the MDF and JRF Community Recovery Projects&#13;
&#13;
                          After the December 2004 tsunami hit the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, the&#13;
                          Government of Indonesia scaled up and adapted its two ongoing national community&#13;
                          driven development (CDD) programs, the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP)&#13;
                          and the Urban Poverty Program (UPP), to meet post-disaster recovery needs. The&#13;
                          community-based approach of these programs was also extended to large-scale&#13;
                          housing reconstruction through a new program widely known by its Indonesian&#13;
                          acronym, Rekompak. Over the next few years the community driven model used&#13;
                          for reconstruction in Aceh was adapted for the purposes of local level reconstruction&#13;
                          in the wake of other disasters.&#13;
&#13;
                          Through the five projects in the MDF and JRF programs that adopted a CDD approach,&#13;
                          communities were empowered to implement physical reconstruction projects, forming&#13;
                          community level groups to design and build homes and local level infrastructure.&#13;
                          Building on pre-existing projects and institutional mechanisms, it was possible to begin&#13;
                          operations quickly following the major disasters that hit Indonesia between 2004 and&#13;
                          2010. Project outputs were on average of equal quality to those built by professional&#13;
                          contractors, and were delivered for the same or less cost. Reconstruction activities were&#13;
                          based on collective village mapping and spatial planning processes. The projects have&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   23&#13;

                                                                                          Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia&#13;
                                                                                          Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
been used to respond to multiple types of disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis,&#13;
landslides and volcanic eruptions, and in a post-conflict context, demonstrating that&#13;
they are flexible and adaptable to local needs. Other activities implemented by the&#13;
communities through these programs included disaster risk reduction and preparedness,&#13;
preservation of cultural heritage, and environmental awareness.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the impressive physical results constructed through these&#13;
projects, the MDF and JRF experiences have demonstrated many less tangible&#13;
social benefits. These include faster social recovery from the impact of&#13;
disasters and increased confidence and capacities of local actors to engage&#13;
in local level planning. Most importantly, the community driven approach to&#13;
reconstruction empowers victims of natural disaster to become key agents in&#13;
their own recovery.&#13;
&#13;
The CDD approach provided the backbone for the five community recovery projects of&#13;
the MDF and JRF. Together they accounted for more than US$260 million, representing&#13;
over one third of the total of the combined allocations of the MDF and JRF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Key Principles of Community Driven Reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
    All five projects applied the same key CDD principles for delivery of local&#13;
    level recovery and reconstruction. Most important among these principles is&#13;
    that a participatory and consultative approach is used by the communities&#13;
    themselves to:&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Identify needs and verify beneficiaries&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Develop community plans and make decisions&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Implement physical construction projects and provide project oversight&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Manage funds&#13;
&#13;
    Additional key Community Driven Reconstruction principles include:&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Facilitation by third party consultant facilitators, hired by government&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 On-going engagement with and oversight by local authorities&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Transparent accounting of funds and results&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Broad- based participation with a commitment to increasing the involvement of 		&#13;
   	 women and other marginal groups&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Demonstrating good governance by attempting to resolve issues at the most local 	&#13;
   	 level and providing robust mechanisms for handling complaints&#13;
&amp;#12;24&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          The community driven projects of the MDF and JRF faced a number of challenges&#13;
                          and obstacles, all of which provide lessons for future interventions. Some challenges&#13;
                          related to the difficult operating environments in post-disaster Aceh, Nias and Java,&#13;
                          such as the shortage of local facilitators and difficulties in accessing certain areas,&#13;
                          factors common to most post-disaster scenarios. Other challenges were related&#13;
                          to the community driven approach itself, including difficulties in ensuring the full&#13;
                          participation of women and marginalized groups, and in ensuring continued operations&#13;
                          and maintenance of project outputs after the projects close.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Strengths of the Community Driven Approach to Reconstruction&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Re-empowers communities devastated by disaster. By involving communities in the&#13;
                             planning and implementation, this approach allows communities to become agents&#13;
                             in their own recovery rather than remain simply as victims and recipients of aid.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Creates an entry point for local recovery. The institutional structure of community&#13;
                             boards and committees set up through the community driven model provides a&#13;
                             platform for communities to engage with outsiders (e.g., government, humanitarian&#13;
                             organizations, NGOs) about reconstruction. Other agencies supporting post-disaster&#13;
                             recovery were able to leverage the community driven model to engage with&#13;
                             communities to identify needs and coordinate resources and activities. Furthermore,&#13;
                             the pre-existing project funding arrangements gave central government a mechanism&#13;
                             to channel resources directly to local level to meet needs that had been identified by&#13;
                             the communities.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Serves as an effective tool for identifying beneficiaries and targeting resources.&#13;
                             Community identification of beneficiaries, while a lengthy process, results in the&#13;
                             general sense that resources are distributed fairly. This is a great advantage in&#13;
                             reconstruction settings where communities often experience sudden influxes of&#13;
                             resources at local level at a time when demand is high and coordination is difficult.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Leads to average lower cost of outputs. Community driven reconstruction makes&#13;
                             use of local resources, including information, expertise, materials and financial&#13;
                             contributions. Furthermore, communities are able to make use of salvaged materials,&#13;
                             where contractors are not, resulting in lower unit costs on average.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Creates efficiencies in dealing with corruption. Widely publicized complaint handling&#13;
                             systems, sophisticated Management Information Systems (MIS) and local level&#13;
                             oversight by elected committees can result in a speedy resolution of cases of alleged&#13;
                             corruption and fraud and return of misused funds.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢	 Offers a valuable reconstruction asset generated through facilitator networks.&#13;
                             The network of facilitators fielded through the projects can be used to collect local&#13;
                             information and data for needs assessments and other purposes benefiting the&#13;
                             overall reconstruction.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        25&#13;

Public information like this poster board, explaining about reconstruction       Photo:&#13;
programs at Girisuko village, Bantul, Yogyakarta ensures transparency and        Rekompak&#13;
encourages accountability, making the community driven approach more efficient   Team&#13;
in dealing with corruption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Promotes DRR and community preparedness. The Rekompak program&#13;
   demonstrates how community driven mechanisms can be used to build resilience&#13;
   to future disasters during the reconstruction process. Community processes enforced&#13;
   earthquake-resistant building standards and can bring communities together to map&#13;
   risks and plan for future disasters.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Builds local capacities. Communities can learn practical skills in planning, construction&#13;
   techniques and bookkeeping, and gain a familiarity in interacting with local&#13;
   governments. A more effective relationship between citizens and local government&#13;
   leads to improved local level planning beyond the reconstruction period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Community Recovery Achievements of the MDF and JRF:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Over 34,600 houses rebuilt or rehabilitated&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 More than 3,350 kilometers of roads repaired or constructed&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Nearly 1,900 kilometers of irrigation and drainage repaired/constructed&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 550 schools rebuilt or equipped&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Over 19,000 meters of bridges repaired or reconstructed&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 515 village halls and government offices rebuilt&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 7,000 loans distributed&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 9,500 scholarships distributed&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Over 3,800 villages involved&#13;

                    Addressing Challenges in the Community Driven Reconstruction&#13;
                    Approach&#13;
                          Long Startup Phase: Physical reconstruction of houses or local infrastructure could&#13;
                          only begin after communities were mobilized, beneficiaries were identified, facilitators&#13;
                          were in place and funds were available, meaning that reconstruction seemed to start&#13;
                          later when compared to other models of delivery of reconstruction. However, strong&#13;
                          involvement of the communities from the beginning of the process leads them to see&#13;
                          the dividends starting at the initiation rather than the completion of reconstruction.&#13;
                          Expectations of all stakeholders, including government and donors, need to be&#13;
                          managed in this process as well.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   27&#13;

                                                                                          Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
Recruitment of Facilitators: In any reconstruction program skilled technical assistance&#13;
and facilitation resources are in high demand and short supply. Good facilitators are&#13;
essential to the success of the community driven approach, with project evaluation&#13;
documentation reflecting a correlation between the quality of the facilitator and&#13;
the quality of outputs. This challenge was resolved by adapting the compensation&#13;
arrangements of facilitators to reflect the difficulties of the environment.&#13;
&#13;
Participation of Women: Despite a number of initiatives taken to increase the&#13;
meaningful participation of women, the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement remained&#13;
an issue. Obstacles included cultural roles and competing demands on womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
time including child care responsibilities. Project designs need to include very&#13;
practical, prescriptive measures, taking into account local behaviors and practical&#13;
realities to ensure the active and credible participation of women in all stages&#13;
of reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
Inclusion of Marginalized Groups: The consultative and participatory processes&#13;
of CDD lend themselves to consolidating a general, collective opinion of the&#13;
majority voice in communities. Special attention is therefore needed to identify&#13;
the specific needs of vulnerable, marginalized or minority groups.&#13;
&#13;
Operations and Maintenance: Physical assets created through the CDD model that&#13;
are in the public rather than private domain face challenges related to operations and&#13;
maintenance, as local governments often do not recognize these community assets&#13;
as their responsibility or allocate budgets for operations and maintenance. Clear&#13;
arrangements for ownership of newly-built community infrastructure and appropriate&#13;
handover of assets to local authorities after completion should be put in place at the&#13;
beginning of the reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
Rising Cost of Materials: A steep rise in the cost of materials during implementation&#13;
meant that the Rekompak Aceh project had to substantially reduce the total number&#13;
of units built. Taking a lesson from this experience, the Rekompak project shifted from&#13;
providing a completely finished house to providing assistance to build a â&#128;&#156;core houseâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
in response to the 2006 Java earthquake. Core houses were structurally complete and&#13;
sound houses that met seismic-resistant standards but lacked finishes such as paint,&#13;
plaster and tiles. Owners themselves then used their own resources to complete and&#13;
fine tune their houses.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Key Lessons Learned for Community Driven Reconstruction&#13;
                    1.	 Base the design of CDD mechanisms on sound analysis of the social&#13;
                        environment. Project design should consider questions such as: What&#13;
                        social units remain in the aftermath of the disaster that can lend themselves&#13;
                        to the CDD process? What are the capacities of affected communities&#13;
                        to work together and make decisions? How is money managed by local&#13;
                        communities? To what extent have local administrations been affected and&#13;
                        which local leaders are still in place, capable, and trusted?&#13;
                    2.	 Select a multidisciplinary operational team. A range of skills in community-&#13;
                        based approaches as well as technical expertise and knowledge of&#13;
                        government systems are needed by operational staff and facilitators.&#13;
                    3.	 Empower local communities to carry out planning and decision-making&#13;
                        processes for their own recovery. Providing hands-on opportunities through&#13;
                        community planning exercises and the identification and implementation&#13;
                        of physical reconstruction activities builds skills and capacity for continued&#13;
                        community development.&#13;
                    4.	 Invest in good facilitators and support their work. A network of good&#13;
                        facilitators who are available on call is very much worth the investment in&#13;
                        human capital, for use in different circumstances and disasters.&#13;
                    5.	 Develop clear and simple systems, procedures and guidelines. It is&#13;
                        important to facilitate understanding of how the entire process works, in&#13;
                        terms of steps, scope and timing, for all actors, in particular communities&#13;
                        themselves.&#13;
                    6.	 Develop good communication systems. Communication helps ensure&#13;
                        projects, results, roles and responsibilities, and accountabilities are widely&#13;
                        publicized and understood.&#13;
                    7.	 Ensure timely distribution of funds. Minimizing unnecessary delays in&#13;
                        disbursing funds to community groups is critical for maintaining motivation&#13;
                        to participate and keeping commitment and satisfaction levels high.&#13;
                    8.	 Establish systems for ensuring transparency and accountability. The&#13;
                        credibility of the CDD program depends on simple and transparent systems&#13;
                        for financial and information management shared widely and openly&#13;
                        among stakeholders.&#13;
                    9.	 Develop a highly visible and robust complaint handling mechanism.&#13;
                        Systems should be simple and accessible to all, highly publicized, and&#13;
                        responsive, and information on resolution provided in a timely and&#13;
                        consistent manner.&#13;
                    10. Include prescriptive measures for ensuring full participation of women&#13;
                        and marginalized groups. Setting targets for womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation is a&#13;
                        good first step but does not address the quality of participation. Separate&#13;
                        groups for women help encourage and support leadership.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        29&#13;

                                                                                               Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
Adapting Community Driven Reconstruction in Other Settings&#13;
      A key lesson from the experiences of the JRF and the MDF is that pre-existing CDD&#13;
      mechanisms are very easily adapted for the purposes of local level reconstruction and&#13;
      can bring significant immediate, short, medium and long-term benefits for communities&#13;
      that have suffered from a natural disaster. In Indonesia, the government is now taking&#13;
      this approach beyond the MDF and JRF and adapting the community driven approach to&#13;
      post-disaster recovery, especially the Rekompak approach to housing reconstruction,&#13;
      into its national disaster response program and ongoing community empowerment&#13;
      program. Even when pre-existing mechanisms are not in place, community driven&#13;
      approaches to reconstruction can be implemented to support local recovery.&#13;
      	&#13;
      Establishing mechanisms for community driven reconstruction in the aftermath&#13;
      of a disaster may not appear to deliver immediate benefits due to the investment&#13;
      of time required. However, by engaging communities from the beginning of the&#13;
      process, community driven reconstruction mechanisms allow them to experience&#13;
      the reconstruction dividends even before physical works are completed, and are&#13;
      beneficial throughout subsequent stages of reconstruction and beyond. Therefore, the&#13;
      establishment of community driven reconstruction mechanisms should be considered&#13;
      in any major reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
      The MDF and JRF experiences have shown that local level recovery using a community&#13;
      driven approach can result not only in cost-effective physical outputs, but also&#13;
      empowered communities, with greater capacities and more prepared to face future&#13;
      disasters. Based on Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience, community driven reconstruction should&#13;
      be considered by policy makers in other contexts as an efficient and effective option&#13;
      for delivering local level recovery and achieving sustainable social benefits for&#13;
      communities affected by disasters.&#13;

                                                                                                             Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
                   Community Driven Development and Reconstruction in Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
                   In the aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami, communities in Aceh, haunted by&#13;
                   thirty years of conflict and weak governance and further devastated by the disaster,&#13;
                   were empowered to take control of the reconstruction to rebuild their own houses&#13;
                   and villages. Through government reconstruction projects based on community driven&#13;
                   approaches, they were able to build physical assets that were on average cheaper than&#13;
                   other methods of reconstruction, and achieved high levels of user satisfaction. This&#13;
                   community driven approach to reconstruction was considered so successful that it&#13;
                   was subsequently used by the Government of Indonesia to reconstruct housing after&#13;
                   other natural disasters in the country, including in Java and West Sumatra.&#13;
                   	&#13;
                   This working paper is intended to bring together experiences of community driven&#13;
                   reconstruction from the Community Recovery Programs of the Multi Donor Trust Fund&#13;
                   (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF). The strengths and achievements as well&#13;
                   as challenges and obstacles are examined in order to draw out lessons that might inform&#13;
                   policy and decision makers in both government and development agencies involved in&#13;
                   disaster response planning and reconstruction management. This paper looks at the&#13;
                   experiences of the MDF and JRF programs which channeled funds through programs that&#13;
                   made use of community driven mechanisms to understand how the community driven&#13;
                   approach can be applied to other reconstruction programs. These are consolidated to&#13;
                   produce a number of guiding principles and key elements for replicating and adapting&#13;
                   the community driven processes to support more effective local level recovery in the&#13;
                   aftermath of any future disaster.&#13;
&#13;
                   The lessons captured in this paper present a strong argument for taking a community&#13;
                   driven approach to local level recovery, and suggest ways in which this approach can&#13;
                   be integrated into disaster recovery planning.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Community driven approaches to reconstruction empower&#13;
communities to rebuild their own houses and villages,&#13;
encouraging faster social recovery in the process. These&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                            What is Community Driven Development?&#13;
&#13;
                                            CDD, broadly defined, is an approach that gives control over planning decisions&#13;
                                            and investment resources to community groups and local governments. CDD&#13;
                                            programs operate on the principles of local empowerment, participatory&#13;
                                            governance, demand responsiveness, administrative autonomy, greater&#13;
                                            downward accountability, and enhanced local capacity. Experience has shown&#13;
                                            that given clear rules of the game, access to information, and appropriate&#13;
                                            capacity and financial support, poor men and women can effectively organize in&#13;
                                            order to identify community priorities and address local problems, by working&#13;
                                            in partnership with local governments and other supportive institutions.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s definition of CDD moves beyond the idea of a mechanism that&#13;
                                       involves only community groups towards one that includes other local level actors,&#13;
                                       such as local government. The CDD programs of the MDF and the JRF fit within this&#13;
                                       definition in that, as well as working with local communities, they also engaged the&#13;
                                       government in local level recovery, strengthening local government capacities to&#13;
                                       interact and respond to communities. However, while local government is included&#13;
                                       in this definition, it is important to underscore that CDD is primarily a mechanism&#13;
                                       through which communities are entrusted with funds and authority and facilitated&#13;
                                       and empowered to interact with other local stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The community driven approach to reconstruction used in the JRF and MDF programs&#13;
                                       provided a platform for all stakeholders to come together and make use of each&#13;
                                       otherâ&#128;&#153;s respective strengths. The central government provided policy and guidance,&#13;
                                       donors provided funds, local governments provided oversight and facilitators, and&#13;
                                       crucially for CDD, the existing social assets of affected communities were leveraged to&#13;
                                       make decisions and manage reconstruction resources. While providing a framework&#13;
                                       that brought together different actors involved in local level reconstruction, the CDD&#13;
                                       mechanisms first and foremost empowered communities to become leading agents of&#13;
                                       their own reconstruction and to engage more effectively with other stakeholders, in&#13;
                                       particular with local government.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Community Recovery in the MDF and JRF Programs&#13;
&#13;
                                       The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) and Urban Poverty Project (UPP) had&#13;
                                       already established networks in Aceh before the tsunami hit in December 2004. Soon&#13;
                                       after the disaster, the Government of Indonesia cited the community driven model&#13;
                                       of these programs as an example for local level recovery, the damage and needs&#13;

            Document, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
            In May 2005, the Steering Committee of the MDF approved a package of projects for&#13;
            community recovery, which included a dramatic scale up of KDP and UPP and the&#13;
            development of a large-scale housing reconstruction program based on the same&#13;
            community driven model.2 This decision recognized the potential of the CDD approach&#13;
            to channel funds directly to community level, leveraging pre-existing networks of&#13;
            facilitators, program architecture and the hard-earned trust of communities in these&#13;
            projects. It also drew on experience following the Asian financial crisis, which had&#13;
            already demonstrated the ability of the KDP and UPP programs to respond quickly to&#13;
            crises. With the expansion of these programs and the development of the community&#13;
            driven housing called Rekompak underway, the CDD model became a key vehicle for the&#13;
            reconstruction of Aceh and Nias at local level.&#13;

	 The formal name of the housing reconstruction program is Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project&#13;

                           The total amount of MDF and JRF funds channeled through these projects was&#13;
Chapter 1 - Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           $262.48 million, approximately 35 percent of the total combined MDF and JRF funds&#13;
                           of $739.58 million.&#13;
&#13;
                           All five projects applied the same key principles of CDD for delivery of local level&#13;
                           reconstruction. These included:&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Identification of needs and targeting of beneficiaries by communities themselves&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Planning and decision making by communities&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Project implementation and oversight by communities&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Fund management by communities&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Facilitation by third party consultant facilitators, hired by government&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Ongoing interaction with and oversight by local authorities&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Accounting for funds used and results locally, downward to community members as&#13;
                              well as to governments and donors&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Broad-based participation, including requirements for minimum levels of&#13;
                              participation by women&#13;
                           â&#128;¢	 Transparent and robust complaint handling mechanisms to give credibility to the&#13;
                              governance of the project, based on the principle of â&#128;&#152;subsidiarityâ&#128;&#153; (attempting to&#13;
                              resolve issues at the most local level before aggregating, passing complaints up to&#13;
                              higher levels of the program or to the formal legal system).&#13;
&#13;
                           Adapting CDD for Local Level Post-Disaster Recovery&#13;
&#13;
                           In response to the tsunami, the on going national KDP and UPP projects were&#13;
                           expanded and adapted to the reconstruction context. Based on these models,&#13;
                           new projects designed specifically for the post-disaster reconstruction context&#13;
                           were developed. The Rekompak projects in Aceh and Java and the KRRP in&#13;
                           Nias were able to successfully learn from the experience of preceding projects&#13;
                           and were further adapted and evolved to become increasingly efficient vehicles for&#13;
                           local level recovery.&#13;
&#13;
                           KDP and UPP in Aceh and Nias&#13;
                           As mentioned earlier, the KDP and the UPP both existed in Aceh before the tsunami&#13;
                           struck. At the time the KDP covered 2,923, or 45 percent of villages in Aceh. The MDF&#13;
                           funds allowed a massive scaling up of both projects, which were also adapted to&#13;
                           accommodate post-disaster needs of communities. They included, for example, social&#13;
                           funds that could be channeled to meet the most urgent needs of the community,&#13;
                           as defined by the communities themselves, and which were not being met by other&#13;
                           agencies. The KDP program also hired subdistrict level Information Facilitators, who&#13;
                           helped channel reconstruction information to communities and helped communities&#13;
                           coordinate with donors and agencies working locally on community reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                           Rekompak Aceh&#13;
                           While the UPP program itself was scaled up, it was also used as the basis for a pilot for&#13;
                           the Rekompak housing project. Using facilitators and manuals already in the field, a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                               35&#13;
              UPP â&#128;&#156;bridging teamâ&#128;&#157; started to modify the program in order to focus on housing. As it&#13;

                                                                                                                                      Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia&#13;
                                                                                                                                      Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
              expanded into a program that would build houses across affected areas of Aceh, UPP&#13;
              funds were utilized initially pending the availability of the MDF funds.&#13;
&#13;
              The community decision-making processes of the UPP were adapted for Rekompak&#13;
              to better fit the nature of the needed outputs which were private houses rather than&#13;
              public infrastructure. Groups consisting of about ten households worked together&#13;
              and managed funds in one joint account, encouraging collaboration and collective&#13;
              oversight. The consultative processes of Rekompak were used to support communities&#13;
              in preparing Community Settlement Plans (CSP) to guide the reconstruction of&#13;
              settlement infrastructure. Based on the CSP, support for small-scale infrastructure was&#13;
              provided to rebuild the settlements.&#13;
&#13;
              In line with the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s housing assistance policy, the project provided&#13;
              IDR 10 million ($1,100) for partially damaged houses, and IDR 28.8 million&#13;
              ($3,200) for fully destroyed houses, both based on a structure with a floor space&#13;
              of 36 square meters.3 Due to rapidly escalating construction costs in Aceh, this&#13;
              was later revised to IDR 15 million ($1,660) for a damaged house and IDR 53&#13;
              million ($5,880) for a destroyed house.4 The project also financed block grants for&#13;
              the rehabilitation of small-scale priority infrastructure (mainly secondary and&#13;
              tertiary networks, such as access roads and drainage) to enhance effectiveness of&#13;
              the shelter repairs and reconstruction program, based on CSPs formulated by the&#13;
              communities themselves.&#13;
&#13;
              KRRP Nias&#13;
              Two years into the post-tsunami reconstruction program, housing reconstruction&#13;
              in Nias Island was at a critical stage. Professional contractors used by the&#13;
              government and international reconstruction partners were found to be lacking&#13;
              in capacity, resulting in delays, substandard construction and complaints from&#13;
              beneficiaries.5 International non-governmental organizations and development&#13;
              agency housing commitments were greatly scaled back as the realities of the&#13;
              challenging operating environment became clear. Because of the increasing&#13;
              complaints from the public, challenging logistics, and rising costs of materials, in&#13;
              June 2006 the BRR adopted a different approach to housing reconstructionâ&#128;&#148;an&#13;
              approach based on community participation in housing design and construction. At&#13;
              the request of the BRR, the KDP model was adapted for Nias, and the Kecamatan&#13;
              Based Recovery and Planning Project (KRRP) was created. For the remainder of the&#13;
              reconstruction program, the BRR combined its remaining funds for housing with&#13;
              $25.75 million from the MDF in the KRRP community-based housing program,&#13;
              abandoning the contractor approach entirely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
 	 This was later revised to IDR 15 million ($1,660) for a damaged house and IDR 53 million ($5,880) for a destroyed house. Amounts&#13;
   were different for each disaster due to variations in costs over time and between regions.&#13;

 	 Sabandar 2009.&#13;
&amp;#12;36&#13;
                           Initially targeted at building 5,000 houses, the KRRP combined elements of both the&#13;
Chapter 1 - Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           KDP and the Rekompak projects in Aceh and Java. In doing so, it became a flexible&#13;
                           project that could respond to the specific and unique needs and challenges of the&#13;
                           island. Learning from the Rekompak approach of building houses through small&#13;
                           community groups, it evolved to also include projects to reconstruct local level&#13;
                           infrastructure, including schools and village halls. KRRP was also adapted to provide&#13;
                           assistance for environmental awareness and to promote preservation of the unique&#13;
                           cultural heritage of Nias. KRRP played an important â&#128;&#152;gap-fillingâ&#128;&#153; role, working with&#13;
                           communities that were hardest to reach, and which were not being served by other&#13;
                           agencies. This of course had an impact on the speed and cost of the project.&#13;
&#13;
                           Rekompak in Java&#13;
                           When Yogyakarta and parts of Central Java were hit by a major earthquake in May&#13;
                           2006, the Government of Indonesia was quick to identify the Rekompak model as its&#13;
                           main vehicle for delivering housing assistance. The lessons learned from Rekompak in&#13;
                           Aceh informed the design of the project in Java, and it evolved and adapted to become&#13;
                           more efficient, supporting the reconstruction and rehabilitation of over 15,000 houses&#13;
                           and over 3,000 low-cost temporary shelters with JRF funding.&#13;
&#13;
                           Directly after the disaster struck, the national government stated that housing&#13;
                           reconstruction would be done through the Rekompak program. Again, the pre-&#13;
                           existing UPP network was leveraged, facilitators were trained to implement housing&#13;
                           reconstruction, and government funds were used to start the housing program while&#13;
                           waiting for donor funds from the JRF to be channeled thorough the government&#13;
                           treasury. This initial phase of the Rekompak program was referred to as P2KP Peduli&#13;
                           (UPP Cares). Learning from the experience in Aceh and scaling up the pre-existing&#13;
                           UPP project, Rekompak constructed 6,000 houses in the first six months after the&#13;
                           earthquake while testing and adapting the model for Yogya. The resulting design was&#13;
                           used as the basis for reconstructing 300,000 houses using funds from the Government&#13;
                           of Indonesia, in addition to the 15,000 built with JRF funding.&#13;
&#13;
                           The major change in the program design was that rather than providing assistance&#13;
                           to build complete houses, communities were instead promised assistance towards&#13;
                           building or renovating a â&#128;&#156;core houseâ&#128;&#157;, a basic structure of exterior walls and roof,&#13;
                           with the owners encouraged to contribute their own funds to complete construction.&#13;
                           This allowed the number of beneficiaries of the project to remain constant, and the&#13;
                           projectâ&#128;&#153;s objective of building 15,000 houses was somewhat protected from inflation&#13;
                           and rising reconstruction costs.&#13;
&#13;
                           The program in Java also had a stronger focus on disaster risk reduction (DRR),&#13;
                           with both the houses and the Community Settlement Plans developed according to&#13;
                           strict DRR criteria. Communities had to agree to have their houses inspected during&#13;
                           reconstruction to ensure they adhered to DRR construction methods, a requirement&#13;
                           for transfer of funding tranches to the group accounts. The project also provided funds&#13;
                           for community disaster preparedness activities.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       37&#13;

                                                                                              Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
Rekompak project was extended to cover these areas. In 2010, 88 villages that were&#13;
affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi were also added to the project. In this way,&#13;
the Rekompak project was able to respond quickly to the needs of communities hit&#13;
by different types of disaster, proving to be a robust model for reconstruction. The&#13;
consultative processes of the project were also put to use in designing the settlement&#13;
plans for communities that were relocated outside the Merapi danger zone.&#13;
&#13;
By the close of the MDF and JRF programs in 2012, the CDD mechanisms of the UPP, first&#13;
adapted for reconstruction purposes in Aceh, had evolved into a dedicated government&#13;
mechanism for housing and settlement reconstruction in disaster prone areas.&#13;
&#13;
CDD within the Wider Reconstruction Context&#13;
&#13;
The experiences of the MDF and JRF in using the community driven approach for&#13;
reconstruction demonstrate the effectiveness of the model as a vehicle for post-&#13;
disaster recovery at the local level. The approach is particularly effective in local level&#13;
reconstruction for a number of reasons. Firstly, engaging affected and traumatized&#13;
populations contributes to the psychological recovery of communities. Secondly, the&#13;
CDD model is able to mobilize local information that is not readily available to external&#13;
actors, such as government and relief and reconstruction agencies. It also provides&#13;
forums for negotiating disputes, which are more likely in the context of a sudden influx&#13;
of reconstruction resources. And channeling government funds through community&#13;
driven reconstruction programs provides a clear demonstration of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
attention to the most localized needs in the aftermath of a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
It is important to point out that the community driven reconstruction approach cannot&#13;
be used to address all post-disaster reconstruction needs. The approach should be used&#13;
to complement and work in parallel to functions fulfilled by other actors. Large-scale&#13;
infrastructure projects, such as major roads, ports, airports and telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure, were implemented by government agencies or professional contractors&#13;
who are best suited to do so. The community driven model also does not address&#13;
many of the other needs during reconstruction, such as provision of temporary basic&#13;
services through the deployment of teachers and nurses, or provision of security.&#13;
&#13;
Clearly, in any reconstruction program different actors are needed to fulfill different&#13;
functions and deliver on different needs. The CDD model facilitated and empowers a&#13;
key group of actorsâ&#128;&#148;the affected communities themselvesâ&#128;&#148;to fulfill an important set&#13;
of needs by rebuilding housing and supporting local level recovery.&#13;

APPROACH TO RECONSTRUCTION&#13;

                                                                                                                      Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
                           The CDD approach provided the backbone for the five community recovery projects&#13;
                           of the MDF and JRF. Through these five projects, communities were empowered to&#13;
                           implement physical reconstruction, building homes and local level infrastructure.&#13;
                           Project outputs were on average of equal quality to those built by professional&#13;
                           contractors, and were delivered for the same or less cost.&#13;
&#13;
                           In addition to the impressive physical results constructed through these projects,&#13;
                           the MDF and JRF experiences have demonstrated many less tangible social benefits.&#13;
                           These include faster social recovery from the impact of disasters, and increased&#13;
                           confidence and capacities of local actors to engage in local level planning. Most&#13;
                           importantly, the community driven approach to reconstruction empowers victims&#13;
                           of natural disaster to become key agents in their own recovery, which has important&#13;
                           psychological benefits.&#13;
&#13;
                           This chapter outlines the strengths of the community driven approach as used in a&#13;
                           post-disaster reconstruction context and provides examples from MDF and JRF&#13;
                           experiences in implementing this approach in Indonesia.&#13;

       2.1	 The Consultative and Participatory Processes&#13;
                     Each of the CDD programs under the MDF and JRF portfolio followed a similar&#13;
                     participatory cycle consisting of:&#13;
&#13;
                     1.	     Socialization of the projects and registration of local volunteers&#13;
                     2.	     Election of community representatives&#13;
                     3.	     Formation of oversight/monitoring committee(s)&#13;
                     4.	     Identification of beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; and local level reconstructionâ&#128;&#153;s needs and priorities&#13;
                     5.	     Preparation of reconstruction plans and project designs and budgets&#13;
                     6.	     Implementation of projects&#13;
&#13;
                     The programs were all dependent on good facilitators to ensure the processes&#13;
                     were followed and that meetings were attended by as many villagers as possible.&#13;
                     Communities were brought together to collectively identify needs and/or beneficiaries,&#13;
                     plan projects, manage and account for funds, oversee quality, and sign off on delivery.&#13;
                     A key principle was to be as inclusive as possible, seeking to actively include women,&#13;
                     poor families and marginalized individuals in the participatory processes.&#13;

                                                                                 financially motivated to support each other and ensure quality across all households.&#13;

                                                                                                                 Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
                reconstruction. During a reconstruction program, when international public scrutiny&#13;
                is high, governments, international NGOs and donors have a renewed aversion to risk.&#13;
                For international NGOs that have embarked on highly visible fund raising campaigns&#13;
                and operate in high profile reconstruction environments, it is often seen as a big a risk&#13;
                to hand over the management of funds and control of projects to villagers themselves.&#13;
                Aside from the risk that funds may be mismanaged, there is also the risk that projects&#13;
                may not deliver. Donors channeling aid to reconstruction programs, answerable to their&#13;
                parliaments and public, feel the pressure to deliver fast, visible results. On the face of it,&#13;
                this would seem to favor the use of professional contractors for reconstruction programs.&#13;
&#13;
                The MDF and JRF community driven projects not only challenged this perception,&#13;
                they also allowed affected communities to become key agents in the recovery efforts.&#13;
                Drawing on the experiences of donors such as the Netherlands, a long time supporter&#13;
                of CDD projects in Indonesia, the donors of the MDF and JRF were encouraged to&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;take the riskâ&#128;&#157; in the belief that communities were able to fully participate in all&#13;
                aspects of reconstruction. The projects approved reflected the belief that, given&#13;
                the right mechanisms and facilitation, communities could manage all aspects of&#13;
                local level reconstruction, including fund management, and could do so as well&#13;
                as professional contractors. As a result, the communities affected by disaster in&#13;
                Aceh, Nias and Java were no longer viewed as victims of disaster and beneficiaries&#13;
                of assistance; through the CDD projects they also took the lead in the reconstruction&#13;
                of their own lives.&#13;
&#13;
                The collective nature through which communities worked had a direct and positive&#13;
                impact on the quality and sustainability of project outputs. It also as promoted a general&#13;
                sense that reconstruction aid was being distributed in an equitable manner at village&#13;
                level. The KDP, UPP, KRRP and Rekompak projects organized communities into groups&#13;
                and forums which allowed them to plan, design, manage and oversee reconstruction&#13;
                at the village level. Most importantly, the consultative and participatory processes&#13;
                provided a platform for communities to give inputs to the reconstruction process at&#13;
                the local level, not only to the MDF and JRF programs but to projects implemented&#13;
                by other agencies as well. In this way, the programs were able to achieve the type&#13;
                of empowerment of communities that Robert Chambers, a pioneer of participatory&#13;

                capture in the form of collusion between social elites and possibly corrupt facilitators&#13;
                who sought to extort money from beneficiaries of the projects. Even in Nias, an area&#13;
                known to have serious governance challenges, KRRP beneficiaries were empowered to&#13;
                make an open and public challenge of any facilitators seeking to extort funds, resulting&#13;
                in the prosecution of the facilitators.&#13;
&#13;
                The participatory monitoring process used in the projects has been recognized&#13;
                as especially effective for monitoring at village level. Under the KDP and UPP, local&#13;
                monitoring committees were elected by the community members. The committee&#13;
                actively monitored all stages of the projects, from supply of goods, distribution of&#13;
                benefits and financial bookkeeping, to the quality and progress of infrastructure&#13;
                implementation. Teams implementing projects were required to report at public village&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;accountability meetingsâ&#128;&#157; where monitoring committees could assess the quality of&#13;
                the report and comment.&#13;
&#13;
                Social Benefits of the Participatory Processes&#13;
&#13;
                Beyond providing effective mechanisms to plan and implement projects, the&#13;
                participatory processes of the MDF and JRF community driven programs also supported&#13;
                affected communities to rebuild social capital, to strengthen social ties and restore&#13;
                the confidence of individuals affected by the disasters. This was confirmed through&#13;
                a study conducted by the Aceh Community Assistance Research Project (ACARP),&#13;
                which documented social benefits associated with active community involvement in&#13;
                the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦The availability of conducive facilities for community meetings and deliberation is an&#13;
                important early priority for communities recovering from disasterâ&#128;¦Communities that&#13;
                have successfully undertaken collective endeavors benefit from the confidence and&#13;
                momentum that this instills. Locally planned and executed small-scale infrastructure&#13;
                block grants can significantly contribute to the strengthening of social capital in&#13;
                recipient communities.â&#128;&#157;4&#13;

2.3	 Creating Cost Effective and Quality Physical Results&#13;
                Offsetting Unit Costs by Leveraging Local Resources&#13;
&#13;
                Another distinct characteristic of reconstruction projects based on the community&#13;
                driven approach is their ability to leverage resources from other sources. The MDF&#13;
                and JRF projects were able to leverage co-financing from government and also in-&#13;
                kind contributions from community members, helping to keep down costs. After the&#13;
                earthquake in Java, members of the communities were able to use materials salvaged&#13;
                from the earthquake to rebuild their houses. In Nias, the community contributions&#13;

            optimum use of funds.7&#13;
&#13;
            Community Driven Housing Reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
            The CDD approach to housing reconstruction proved effective in delivering housing&#13;
            assistance in difficult operating environments where other agencies were unable or&#13;
            unwilling to operate. In areas that presented a logistical challenge, such as remote&#13;
            areas of Nias and the island of Simeulue in Aceh province, it was the communities&#13;
            themselves that transported materials to villages with little or no access. The&#13;
            community driven model was also successful in rebuilding in areas that presented&#13;
            social and other challenges. In Lambung, Aceh, in a village that was avoided by other&#13;
            agencies because of social and land issues, the Rekompak project was able to â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦.re-&#13;
            plan the urban ward, consolidate the land ownership, rebuild the houses and became&#13;
            a model of development.â&#128;&#157;8&#13;
&#13;
            These experiences demonstrate the strength of the CDD approach in navigating and&#13;
            negotiating not only logistical challenges but also complex social and land issues. In&#13;
            this way, the CDD approach is able to deliver assistance in areas were other actors,&#13;
            including contractors and NGOs, are not.&#13;
&#13;
            The higher levels of involvement of communities through the community driven&#13;
            reconstruction approach also resulted in higher occupancy rates and higher satisfaction&#13;
            levels. Given control over the construction processes and substantial training and&#13;
            support from facilitators, communities were able to play a strong oversight and quality&#13;
            assurance role. As a result, the quality of housing reconstruction was often beyond&#13;
            required standards and occupancy rates, and satisfaction levels exceeded the targets&#13;
            in the project design documents. Taking Rekompak in Java as an example, out of the&#13;
            15,153 earthquake-resistant houses built in the first phase, 99.6 percent are still&#13;
            occupied. The percentage of beneficiaries satisfied with the quality of their houses&#13;
            was particularly high at 83 percent for those whose homes were rehabilitated.9&#13;
&#13;
            These figures indicate that the levels of satisfaction correlate directly to the level&#13;
            of involvement of owners in the reconstruction of their own houses. Based on this,&#13;
            the conclusion can be drawn that housing reconstruction models that involve the&#13;
            communities themselves in the building of houses are more likely than alternative&#13;
            models to result in high levels of satisfaction.&#13;

                 KDP, UPP and Rekompak were more likely to be appropriate for the local context, and&#13;
                 therefore of most benefit to those within the community, taking into account needs,&#13;
                 capacities, resource endowments and cultural settings. This is again a divergence&#13;
                 from the alternative model for reconstructing infrastructure whereby outside forces,&#13;
                 such as NGOs and government agencies, identify needs and design projects that are&#13;
                 implemented by external actors, such as contractors who are brought in from outside&#13;
                 the community. Infrastructure changes introduced with no or little involvement of the&#13;
                 local community are more likely to be exploited by, and of benefit to, external actors,&#13;
                 as often they do not take into account the local contexts.12 The participatory processes&#13;
                 of the MDF and JRF CDD projects leveraged local knowledge, accurately identified local&#13;
                 needs and therefore resulted in locally appropriate infrastructure projects that fully&#13;
                 reflected the local contexts.&#13;

2.4	 Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction and Preparedness into&#13;
     Local Level Recovery&#13;
                 DRR in the Reconstruction of Physical Assets&#13;
&#13;
                 The experience from the MDF and JRF programs demonstrate that CDD mechanisms can&#13;
                 lend themselves well to the implementation of disaster risk reduction and preparedness&#13;
                 initiatives at the local level, if this is included in the original project design. These&#13;
                 mechanisms can be a channel for educating individuals on DRR building standards,&#13;
                 raising awareness among communities and local governments and thus embedding&#13;
                 DRR and disaster preparedness in the institutional memory of communities living with&#13;
                 the risk of natural disaster. But perhaps the most important lessons related to disaster&#13;
                 preparedness is that having CDD mechanisms already in place when a disaster strikes&#13;
                 may be the most effective mechanism for helping communities to recover.&#13;
&#13;
                 In the aftermath of a disaster, when the reality of the risk is still tangible, development&#13;
                 partners, governments and communities all have a high interest in embedding risk&#13;
                 reduction and preparedness into reconstruction. It is at this time that the incentive&#13;
                 for channeling resources to risk and preparedness activities is most keenly felt. The&#13;
                 challenge is to ensure any reconstruction program addresses DRR at all levels and that&#13;
                 DRR principles and practices are continued beyond the initial momentum brought by&#13;
                 the project.&#13;

CDD structures that are in place when a disaster hits provide the most effective,&#13;
efficient and sustainable mechanism for communities to respond to and recover&#13;
from natural disasters. They provide a readily available mechanism to channel funds&#13;
and expertise. They also provide a framework for communities to manage their own&#13;
recovery and a platform to negotiate with external reconstruction actors. Aside from&#13;
being a channel for reconstruction funds, the structures can also be used to channel&#13;
emergency assistance directly to the local levelâ&#128;&#148;as was demonstrated by the social&#13;
funds channeled through the KDP in Aceh.&#13;

    Intregating DRR in Rekompak:&#13;
    The Case of Gesikan Village in Klaten District, Central Java&#13;
&#13;
    The village of Gesikan in Central Java was badly hit by the earthquake in May&#13;
    2006. Almost all the houses were badly damaged or totally destroyed. The&#13;
    Rekompak Peduli program facilitated the reconstruction of 10 houses while a&#13;
    further 49 were rebuilt by the JRF-funded Rekompak program that began in&#13;
    the village in early 2007.&#13;
&#13;
    The Rekompak program also supported the community of Gesikan to develop&#13;
    Community Settlement Plans (CSP) that incorporated DRR considerations. The&#13;
    CSP for Gesikan included evacuation routes using private land donated by&#13;
    the community and identified â&#128;&#152;safe areasâ&#128;&#153; for the community to gather in the&#13;
    event of a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
    Another aspect of the Rekompak program in Gesikan was the focus on&#13;
    community preparedness. With the help of the village facilitator, members of&#13;
    the community were trained to identify the hazards to which the village was&#13;
    exposed and to develop mitigation and preparedness measures.&#13;
&#13;
    In 2010, the community put together a Disaster Preparedness Group, tasked&#13;
    with implementing DRR and preparedness activities. This group regularly&#13;
    conducts training and simulations in which the whole village participates. Each&#13;
    simulation reinforces the evacuation drills with which all community members&#13;
    are familiar. They include special procedures for assisting children, pregnant&#13;
    women and elderly members of the community. In this way, regardless of&#13;
    the accuracy with which the drills are followed, DRR and preparedness are&#13;
    embedded in the institutional memory of the community and will endure well&#13;
    beyond the lifetime of the project.&#13;

                                                                                           practice, this meant a commitment that all elements of the project should be widely&#13;
                                                                                           publicized and highly visible and that all information should be accessible to the public.&#13;

                                                                                           was explained to communities, which helped encouraged their participation.&#13;

Rekompak promoted transparency through clear communication and widely distributed          Photo:&#13;
information. This banner asks the public to help supervise JRF community grants, stating   JRF&#13;
that no bribes are to be paid and that there is to be no collusion or nepotism. Phone      Secretariat&#13;
numbers are provided in case of complaints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Transparency laid the foundations for achieving high levels of accountability between&#13;
all actors. Because of transparent access to information, communities were able to&#13;
hold project actors accountable for what the programs promised to deliver, be they&#13;
government, facilitators, village heads or members of village committees. The high&#13;
levels of transparency across the projects meant that all those involved understood&#13;
their rights and entitlements, whether this was entitlements to private and public&#13;
goods, or rights to participate and influence decision making. It also meant they had&#13;
access to project information, and were aware of channels to voice their concern if&#13;
they felt their entitlements were not being met.&#13;
&#13;
Project Design&#13;
&#13;
The design of the projects themselves reduced opportunities for corrupt behavior in a&#13;
number of ways, including devolution of decision making to the local level and direct&#13;
transfer of funds from treasury to village level accounts. The final assessments of the&#13;
projects suggest that collective, local level decision making curbed corrupt practices&#13;
to some degree. While incidents of local actors misusing funds, using substandard&#13;
materials or attempting to extort money still occurred in projects, the reports suggest&#13;
that the participative and collective decision making and the strong sense of ownership&#13;
deterred local actors from engaging in corrupt activity.&#13;
&#13;
The direct transfer of funds to village level accounts served to mitigate against&#13;
corruption by circumventing multiple layers of bureaucracy and also by putting funds&#13;
in the hands of those with the least incentive to misuse them. Communities were&#13;
in this way able to have clear oversight over how funds were used. The Rekompak&#13;
communities in Java, for example, formed Collective Purchasing Groups (Kelompok&#13;
Belanja Bersama) that took collective responsibility for buying building materials. This&#13;
collective action ensured better oversight of the use of funds.&#13;

       and inaccurate targeting of beneficiaries. The approach of the projects was to seek&#13;
       resolution of the issue at village level first, before aggregating to higher levels of&#13;
       authority. In some cases, community projects were stopped while issues of corruption&#13;
       were investigated, further strengthening communitiesâ&#128;&#153; motivation to seek resolution.&#13;
       The MIS systems of the projects record high levels of resolution to complaints received&#13;
       and incidents of corruption identified.&#13;
&#13;
       All projectsâ&#128;&#153; final assessments highlight the importance of the facilitators in reducing&#13;
       corruption. They were instrumental in supporting greater transparency by publicizing&#13;
       the complaint handling systems, in actively encouraging citizens to report complaints,&#13;
       and in bringing communities together to collectively resolve issues when identified.&#13;

       The strength of the CDD model as a vehicle for local level recovery lies in the long-term&#13;
       benefits of the projects that go well beyond their lifetime. Not only do private and&#13;
       public assets continue to benefit communities beyond project completion, but also&#13;
       the community driven approach results in sustained capacities at local level that&#13;
       benefit village level development planning processes long after the project ends.&#13;
&#13;
       Maintenance of Houses&#13;
&#13;
       The extensive involvement of home owners in housing reconstruction contributed&#13;
       to the sustainability of the MDF and JRF housing projects. The KRRP and Rekompak&#13;
       programs produced houses with high occupancy rates, high levels of satisfaction and&#13;
       strong sense of ownership by beneficiaries. This contributed to the houses being well&#13;
       maintained beyond project closure. Indeed, homeowners often went beyond simply&#13;
       maintaining the quality of the houses they were provided by adding and improving&#13;
       the structures over time. This was particularly true in Java, where the approach of&#13;
       providing â&#128;&#152;coreâ&#128;&#153; housing units rather than complete houses encouraged individual&#13;
       owners to invest their own resources. As a result of the CDD approach, the quality&#13;
       of the houses constructed under the JRF and MDF was not only sustained but also&#13;
       improved over time.&#13;
&#13;
       The high occupancy rates of Rekompak houses also demonstrate that giving&#13;
       communities the choices and responsibilities for building their own homes contributes&#13;
       to higher levels of satisfaction.&#13;

                                                                           conflict in Aceh had left many of the affected communities fractured and individuals&#13;

                                                                           to work together and negotiate differences through public discussions.&#13;

                                                                           encouraged more positive interaction between citizens and their local governments.&#13;
                                                                           Communities became familiar with their local government institutions and their functions,&#13;
                                                                           and learned how to interact constructively with them. These capacities continue to be&#13;

                                                                                                            Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
                the ability to collectively recognize and prioritize development needs and elect local&#13;
                leaders and representatives. The projects helped communities to identify their&#13;
                reconstruction needs, and then to prioritize them through a participatory process. They&#13;
                also required communities to elect representatives for village committees and working&#13;
                groups. These skills, developed during reconstruction, are of continued value for local&#13;
                level development, particularly in the context of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s decentralization process.&#13;
&#13;
                Community Driven Mechanisms Beyond Reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
                Perhaps the most important lesson that has been learned from the community&#13;
                recovery projects of the MDF and JRF is that the CDD mechanisms can evolve with&#13;
                communities as they move from emergency to early recovery through reconstruction&#13;
                to routine development. In the immediate stage after a disaster, community driven&#13;
                mechanisms can be leveraged to disburse cash or social funds to households. In the early&#13;
                recovery stages, they can be used to identify beneficiaries and needs, target resources&#13;
                to needs, and manage reconstruction actors at local level. During reconstruction, they&#13;
                can be used to manage and oversee reconstruction of physical assets and to develop&#13;
                settlement plans. As reconstruction ends, the community driven mechanisms can be&#13;
                used to help communities and local governments interact constructively. One such&#13;
                example is in Aceh, where the provincial village level development program, known&#13;
                as Bantuan Keuangan Gampong or BKPG, leveraged the PNPM structures to allocate&#13;
                development funds to every village.&#13;
&#13;
                As communities of Aceh, Nias and Java have moved beyond reconstruction into&#13;
                routine development, the CDD projects have laid the foundations for improved local&#13;
                level social contracts. One of the most significant findings related to social capital in&#13;
                the ACARP report was that â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦frequent and regular village meetings help build trust in&#13;
                the community, and engender increased trust of local government leaders as well.â&#128;&#157; 14&#13;
                In this way, the design of the CDD projects of the MDF and JRF contributed to longer-&#13;
                term sustainable relationships between local level actors, including local government.&#13;
                Like elsewhere in the country under the PNPM program, the CDD mechanisms play an&#13;
                important part in the evolutionary process of decentralization. They strengthen local&#13;
                governments to be responsive and strengthen civil society to hold local government&#13;
                accountable. In this way, community driven reconstruction projects can support the&#13;
                journey towards decentralized, democratic governance long after the post-disaster&#13;
                reconstruction program ends.&#13;

                        The MDF and JRF projects that used a community driven reconstruction approach&#13;
                        can point to remarkable achievements. The projects faced a number of challenges&#13;
                        and obstacles along the way, however, which provide important lessons for future&#13;
                        interventions. Some challenges related to the difficult operating environments in&#13;
                        post-disaster Aceh, Nias and Java. Many of these factors are common to most post-&#13;
                        disaster scenarios. Other challenges were linked to the community driven approach&#13;
                        itself. These are not unique to post-disaster settings but are challenges that&#13;
                        projects using the CDD approach have experienced elsewhere, such as difficulties&#13;
                        in ensuring the full participation of women and marginalized groups, and in making&#13;
                        arrangements for continued operations and maintenance of project outputs after&#13;
                        projects close. This chapter examines the challenges and obstacles faced by the MDF&#13;
                        and JRFâ&#128;&#153;s community recovery projects, looks at the steps taken to overcome them&#13;
                        in Indonesia, and makes suggestions for addressing them in future reconstruction&#13;
                        scenarios.&#13;

       3.1	 Challenges in the Crucial Start-up Phase: Investing Time and&#13;
            Resources&#13;
                    The community driven approach requires significant investment of time in the early&#13;
                    stage of project implementation, but the experiences of the MDF and JRF show that&#13;
                    the up-front investment is worth it. In a post-disaster reconstruction context, a high&#13;
                    premium is placed on speed and all agencies involved are under enormous pressure&#13;
                    to deliver visible results quickly. This sometimes deters donors and governments from&#13;
                    channeling reconstruction aid through CDD channels, as there is an impression that&#13;
                    community driven programs are slow to set up and disburse funds. CDD programs&#13;
                    require an investment of time and effort in the initial stages: to hire and train facilitators,&#13;
                    establish community committees, put in place monitoring, oversight and complaint&#13;
                    handling mechanisms, and make local communities familiar with the programs and the&#13;
                    entitlements they bring. However, once these are in place, the programs then quickly&#13;
                    disburse large amounts of funds across multiple villages simultaneously. Furthermore,&#13;
                    as the programs mature and communities and local governments become comfortable&#13;
                    with the mechanisms, CDD programs can be adapted to new needs, thus increasing their&#13;
                    overall cost effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;

are always in high demand and short supply.&#13;

                                                                                    was particularly acute in the aftermath of the tsunami. Despite initial low disbursement&#13;

                                                                                    setting up the projects and identifying beneficiaries through consultative processes&#13;

Finding and retaining good facilitators is crucial to the success of any CDD program but&#13;
is difficult when demand is high and circumstances are challenging. In a post-disaster&#13;
scenario, local facilitators are in high demand by NGOs and donors. In Aceh and Nias&#13;
the competition for facilitators was compounded by the uncommonly high levels of&#13;
funds at the disposition of reconstruction actors. Competition for skilled facilitors was&#13;
keen, with the result that reconstruction agencies increased the salaries of facilitators,&#13;
particularly those required to work in remote and challenging areas such as Nias. The&#13;

KRRP in Nias experienced a particularly extended period of low disbursement, largely&#13;
attributed to the difficulties of working in Nias. The problem was further compounded&#13;
by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s initial reluctance to adapt the pay scale to the difficult nature&#13;
of the operating environment, making it difficult to recruit and retain facilitators. The&#13;
compensation packages and travel allowances for facilitators in Nias were eventually&#13;
adjusted to reflect Niasâ&#128;&#153; state as a hardship post.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Escalating Construction Costs&#13;
&#13;
In Aceh and Nias, program costs, including materials and human resource costs,&#13;
increased during implementation due to inflation and lack of supply coupled with high&#13;
demand. Unit costs across KDP, UPP and Rekompak therefore increased, meaning that&#13;
in most cases the number of units to be built was revised downwards. Learning from&#13;
this experience, the Rekompak program of the JRF changed its approach and, instead&#13;

                 MDF and JRF Rekompak projects promoted womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment and participation in                        Photo:&#13;
                 all aspects of community planning and decision making. Here a group of women discuss                   Rosaleen&#13;
                 a model for the proposed reconstruction of their settlement based on the Community                     Cunningham&#13;
                 Settlement Plan (CSP), which they helped their community develop after the eruptions of&#13;
                 Mount Merapi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 In Aceh, most of the affected villages experienced higher death rates in the tsunami&#13;
                 among women than men. Psychosocial stress also undermined womenâ&#128;&#153;s capacities to&#13;
                 participate meaningfully in project activities. Further, in Aceh, Nias and Java, cultural&#13;
                 factors impeded womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in public meetings. One woman, quoted in the&#13;
                 JRF 2009 annual report, stated â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦Wives in Javanese society are known as the husbandâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                 friend in the back.â&#128;&#157; This suggests that while women in Java may play a significant role in&#13;
                 influencing decisions in private forums, they are unaccustomed to contributing in public&#13;
                 forums. Other factors limiting the ability of women to participate in public meetings&#13;
                 were purely practical. Women JRF beneficiaries interviewed in Central Java said their&#13;
                 daily tasks of running their households and looking after their children left them little&#13;
                 time to participate in lengthy meetings.1&#13;
&#13;
                 Another challenge related to womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation was the quality of the contributions&#13;
                 from those women who did attend public meetings. All programs found that even when&#13;
                 women were encouraged to attend meetings, they were often reluctant to contribute to&#13;
                 the discussions. All of the MDF and JRF CDD projectsâ&#128;&#153; final assessments identified the&#13;
                 quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation as an issue early in project implementation. Some of&#13;
                 the projects adapted their consultative processes to include special forums, formal or&#13;
                 informal, specifically for women, in environments where they would feel comfortable&#13;
                 to give their opinions and inputs. Despite these adjustments, however, the challenges&#13;
                 remained throughout the lifetime of the projects.&#13;

                                                                                               implementation stage.&#13;

                                                                                               was for women to make up 30 percent of the representation on village boards and in&#13;

                                                                                               methods, using quotas, for example requiring one of the positions of each Housing&#13;
                                                                                               Group, (e.g. secretary, chairperson, treasurer) to be occupied by a woman, with no&#13;

                                                                                               also were required to include women. In Aceh, Rekompak meetings where rescheduled&#13;

                                                                                               conjunction with the general meetings.&#13;

             of proposals from womenâ&#128;&#148;were effective in increasing the participation of women.&#13;
             The MDF-JRF working paper on mainstreaming gender in post-disaster reconstruction&#13;
             programs concluded that higher levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation benefitted the whole&#13;
             community and led to changes in priorities, design and delivery of projects. As one&#13;
             man interviewed in Nias put it, â&#128;&#156;Itâ&#128;&#153;s good to have their (womenâ&#128;&#153;s) ideas; their thinking is&#13;
             different and it helps us make better decisions.â&#128;&#157;4&#13;
&#13;
             Specific Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Empowerment Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
             The UPP project faced difficulties in ensuring the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation despite&#13;
             initially meeting the required 30 percent attendance of women in meetings. A notable&#13;
             adjustment made to the program to address this issue was to reserve $2.35 million of&#13;
             the block grant funds for sub-projects developed through a womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment sub-&#13;
             project activity.5 This had considerable impact and resulted in a noticeable improvement&#13;
             in the participation and financing of activities proposed by women. Women-only&#13;
             meetings helped build confidence and provided a space for women to develop the skills&#13;
             and confidence to engage actively in mixed public fora.6&#13;
&#13;
             Public Goods, Public Interests&#13;
&#13;
             One key weakness of the CDD approach is that the consultative and participatory&#13;
             processes are not designed to meet the needs of specialized groups within the&#13;
             community, such as the disabled and elderly. The community driven reconstruction&#13;
             processes are designed rather to deliver public goods to address the needs of the general&#13;
             public. The result is that while the reconstruction assets delivered by these programs&#13;
             benefitted the community as a whole, the programs for the most part were not able to&#13;
             accommodate specialized needs. The consultative and participatory processes of CDD&#13;
             lend themselves to consolidating a general, collective opinion of the majority voice in&#13;
             communities. Special attention is therefore needed to identify the specific needs of&#13;
             vulnerable, marginalized or minority groups.&#13;
&#13;
             KDP and UPP went to some lengths to address this constraint by including a provision&#13;
             to allocate 25 percent of each block grant for â&#128;&#152;social fundsâ&#128;&#153;. These funds were intended&#13;
             to help meet the needs of the poorest tsunami-affected households that were not&#13;
             being met in a timely manner by other agencies or projects. According to the project&#13;
             Implementation Completion Report, these grants contributed greatly to relieving poverty&#13;
             in the immediate post-disaster context by providing either cash or household essentials&#13;
             to households identified as most in need. However, allocations for social funds are not&#13;
             included in the current national PNPM program.&#13;

                                                                                        decision making included very practical issues, such as lack of time in the daily&#13;
                                                                                        schedules of women and reluctance to use public transport late at night. These&#13;
                                                                                        were compounded with behavioral patterns, such as women being more likely&#13;
                                                                                        to participate in decision making in the private, rather than, public domain.&#13;
                                                                                        The solutions, therefore, had to be very practical in response and also adjust&#13;

                                                                                        program designed a number of practical innovations to encourage women to&#13;

                                                                                        which the women were then able to pool to hire private transport to and from&#13;
                                                                                        meetings and providing incentives to give input by providing lottery tickets to&#13;

                                                                                        improving their self-awareness of their own gender biases.&#13;

                                                                                        highlights a common challenge in project implementationâ&#128;&#148;that projects do&#13;
                                                                                        not lend themselves to learning and innovation during the implementation&#13;
                                                                                        phase. Therefore, it is crucial that during either the design or evaluation&#13;
                                                                                        phase, lessons can be learned and transferred for better implementation of&#13;

                                                                                    were being made. This excluded internally displaced people (IDPs) by default from&#13;
                                                                                    participating in planning and decision making while displaced. This was particularly&#13;
                                                                                    an issue in Aceh, where the extent of the devastation made it impossible for many&#13;
                                                                                    villagers to remain on the land they had once occupied. To overcome this challenge,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                65&#13;

                                                                                                       Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
       village heads to locate IDPs and to hold meetings in their temporary camps. They also&#13;
       brought together IDPs residing in different locations to make decisions related to the&#13;
       reconstruction of a village. The flexibility of the KDP project also allowed project funds&#13;
       to be used to improve the temporary living facilities of IDPs. Such funds were often&#13;
       used to make improvements related to water and sanitation. KDPâ&#128;&#153;s flexibility to find&#13;
       ways to accommodate IDPs contributed to rebuilding not just community infrastructure,&#13;
       but the communities themselves. However, there were also criticisms that while this&#13;
       element of flexibility was positive in helping to restore social cohesion among displaced&#13;
       communities, the efforts to meet the immediate needs of IDPs detracted attention and&#13;
       resources from the principal objectives of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3	 Capacity Challenges&#13;
       The Link Between Quality and Capacities&#13;
&#13;
       In some cases where capacities of communities and their facilitators were weak, quality&#13;
       control issues arose that resulted in project delays. The Rekompak project found that&#13;
       there was a link between the quality of housing and the capacities of both community&#13;
       beneficiaries and the facilitators. Particularly in cases where facilitators were required to&#13;
       cover a disproportionately large area, quality control suffered. This points to the central&#13;
       role of facilitators in project implementation success, and underscores the need to have&#13;
       an adequate number of skilled facilitators to ensure the quality of outputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4	 Ensuring Continued Operations and Maintenance&#13;
     of Public Assets&#13;
       The design of the community driven projects did not allow for the use of community&#13;
       block grants for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) of assets produced under the&#13;
       program. This meant that communities had to look for resources elsewhere. However,&#13;
       the limited budgets of local governments made finding these resources difficult. Funds&#13;
       for operations and maintenance of private goods such as houses were across the&#13;
       responsibility of the individual owners, but finding sources of funding for the operations&#13;
       and maintenance of local level infrastructure proved a challenge.&#13;
&#13;
      The nature of the challenge of ensuring sustainability and good operations and&#13;
      maintenance of assets created through community driven reconstruction projects&#13;
      varied with the type of asset. In general, a number of factors influence the degree to&#13;
      which assets rebuilt through the CDD processes are well maintained. These include the&#13;
      following:&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The link between user and assetâ&#128;&#148;the stronger the link between the user and the&#13;
          asset, the easier it is to ensure continued operations and regular maintenance and&#13;
          sustained project outcomes.&#13;

                                                                                    local governments lacked a strong sense of ownership for some of the public assets&#13;
                                                                                    created through the community driven project and in other cases it was difficult to&#13;

                                                                                              Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
local level actors and ensuring the appropriateness of assets mitigates this risk to some&#13;
degree. In most casses under the MDF and JRF, the communities were willing and able to&#13;
manage the operational costs of most of the local level infrastructure developed through&#13;
the CDD projects. This meant that most of the assets built under these projects did not&#13;
require a formal hand over to local government.&#13;
&#13;
Principles for Encouraging Better O&amp;M&#13;
&#13;
In principle, community driven mechanisms are best applied to the development of&#13;
local, village level infrastructure. In the case that this principle is applied, the O&amp;M of&#13;
the infrastructure is more likely to be within the means of the communities themselves.&#13;
Local communities are not equipped to operate and maintain larger infrastructure, which&#13;
should fall under the jurisdiction of local government. The link between the two levels&#13;
of infrastructure, whereby community driven infrastructure is linked to distric, provincial&#13;
and national networks under higher level government administrations, is important to&#13;
support good O&amp;M. While the O&amp;M of assets generated through the CDD approach&#13;
continues to be a challenge, some principles for future post-disaster situation can be&#13;
drawn from the KDP, UPP, REKOMPAK and KRRP projects. These include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 ensure a genuine need for the assets and demand from the communities by properly&#13;
   applying the principles for CDD planning and decision making;&#13;
â&#128;¢	 socialize operations and maintenance to all stakeholders throughout the project;&#13;
â&#128;¢	 ensure that local government and local communities are aware of O&amp;M challenges&#13;
   throughout implementation;&#13;
â&#128;¢	 ensure project planning includes discussions on operations and maintenance, and&#13;
   asset transfer;&#13;
â&#128;¢	 identify possible institutions for hand-over early on and keep them engaged;&#13;
â&#128;¢	 provide practical training and ideas for O&amp;M to communities and local governments&#13;
   to ensure O&amp;M is planned for and budgeted.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF and JRF experience points to the need for clear arrangements for ownership&#13;
of newly built community infrastructure and appropriate handover of assets to local&#13;
authorities to be put in place at the beginning of a reconstruction program.&#13;

                                                                                                               Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
                    The evidence from Indonesia clearly underscores the many benefits of using large-scale&#13;
                    CDD programs implemented through goverment systems to deliver reconstruction at&#13;
                    village level. Beyond delivering quality, cost-efficient physical outputs, the community&#13;
                    driven reconstruction programs in Aceh, Nias and Java have demonstrated less tangible&#13;
                    but exceptionally important social benefits. These include greater social cohesion,&#13;
                    strengthened local institutions, and improvements in the social contract between&#13;
                    government and civil society at local level.&#13;
&#13;
                    The clearest lesson from the Community Driven Reconstruction experiences of the&#13;
                    JRF and the MDF is that the pre-existence of community driven mechanisms can&#13;
                    greatly increase the speed of local level recovery. The MDF was able to build on the&#13;
                    existing KDP and UPP programs, making use of the existing guidelines and manuals,&#13;
                    the networks of facilitators including engineers, and the existing delivery mechanism&#13;
                    for channeling funds to the local level. The KDP and UPP programs were able to quickly&#13;
                    scale up while the Rekompak model was able to make use of KDP and UPP experience&#13;
                    at central level, and their structures and facilitators at subnational level. KRRP was&#13;
                    able to adapt the Rekompak model for the specific needs of Nias, while the Rekompak&#13;
                    project in Java was able to evolve further again based on experiences in Aceh and Nias&#13;
                    and adapted to the local circumstances.&#13;
                    	&#13;
                    However, it is important to recognize that different enabling environments will&#13;
                    have their impacts on project implementation, and as much as possible, it is worth&#13;
                    capturing this in project design. This chapter discusses factors that influenced&#13;
                    the success of project implementation in Indonesia and looks at a number of&#13;
                    considerations that are useful for future project design.&#13;
&#13;
                    The Enabling Environment&#13;
&#13;
                    Strong Political Support&#13;
                    Political support for the CDD programs existed in Indonesia before the Asian tsunami&#13;
                    in 2004. The well known KDP program had been in existence since 1998, and the UPP&#13;
                    since 1999, so the Indonesian government had a full appreciation of the community&#13;
                    driven development approach including its benefits and its weaknesses. When the&#13;
                    tsunami hit, there was political support for the use of community driven mechanisms&#13;

                                                                   it will require a very clear description of how the CDD program would function with&#13;
                                                                   a strong results framework and simple, appropriate implementation mechanism that&#13;

                                                                   be possible in the absence of political support. However, this type of program may not&#13;
                                                                   deliver many of the benefits of a large-scale, government-implemented program, such&#13;

                                                                   At the time of the tsunami, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the ministry of Public&#13;
                                                                   Works were both already engaged in the implementation of KDP and UPP. While it took&#13;
                                                                   some time to scale up the projects and then adapt the approach to create Rekompak,&#13;
                                                                   the existing experience and capacities within these ministries greatly reduced the start&#13;
                                                                   up time of the projects. By the time the Rekompak model was adapted for the&#13;

                                                                   the start up time was considerably reduced. In a scenario where the government&#13;
                                                                   counterpart has no existing capacities to deliver community driven reconstruction&#13;

                                                                                                Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
the case with the JRF transitional housing program implemented by the International&#13;
Organization of Migration (IOM) in Java, which provided emergency shelter while the&#13;
Rekompak program was in the process of scaling up.&#13;
&#13;
Investing in Facilitators&#13;
As CDD programs rely heavily on good facilitators, the availability of human resources&#13;
skilled for the role can affect the set-up time. All the programs under the MDF and JRF&#13;
suffered delays of some degree due to the time taken to hire and train facilitators. This&#13;
was particularly the case in KRRP in Nias. Therefore, the time that will be needed to recruit&#13;
and train facilitators needs to be considered in the program design. In difficult or remote&#13;
locations, even more so those affected by disaster, facilitators will have to be&#13;
remunerated competitively and operational allowances will have to be set at rates&#13;
appropriate for prevailing costs, which can be greatly inflated and frequently&#13;
changing. It is interesting to note that largely based on its CDD experience, Indonesia&#13;
is now in the process of establishing recognition for â&#128;&#152;Community Facilitatorâ&#128;&#153; as a legally&#13;
recognized and certified profession.&#13;
&#13;
A number of additional measures were taken by the projects to hire and retain good&#13;
facilitators. They include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 More facilitators were allocated to the projects, reflecting the substantially higher&#13;
   workload and pressures to deliver in a reconstruction context.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 A different mix of facilitators was hired, including information facilitators,&#13;
   engineers, and social workers, reflecting the greater complexities that exist during&#13;
   a reconstruction effort.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Facilitators were given higher compensation to reflect the difficult working&#13;
   environments.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Additional training and other support were given to ensure high levels of motivation&#13;
   during difficult times and in difficult working environments. This included additional&#13;
   travel allowances and additional support for improving living conditions. In cases&#13;
   where facilitators themselves were also impacted by disaster, as was the case in&#13;
   Aceh, facilitators may need support to overcome personal trauma or distress.&#13;
&#13;
Legal Frameworks&#13;
In Aceh, Nias and Java, the programs benefitted from legal frameworks that could&#13;
recognize community adjudication. Therefore, communities could develop settlement&#13;
plans and identify plots with their owners in the knowledge that they would be&#13;
legally recognized. Regarding the transfer of block grants to community accounts,&#13;
this mechanism existed already in Indonesia at the time of the tsunami, saving&#13;
significant time.&#13;
&#13;
Such legal frameworks may not exist in other countries hit by natural disaster.&#13;
Therefore, when applying CDD principles to reconstruction it is important to consider&#13;
the legal constraints. Addressing legal constraints does not necessarily require new&#13;
laws; decrees and regulations that are program specific or are related to disaster&#13;
response can suffice, at least in the interim.&#13;

                                                                         long-term benefits of implementing local level reconstruction through a community&#13;
                                                                         driven process. A number of lessons have emerged from Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience that&#13;
                                                                         would assist those setting up future community driven reconstruction programs in the&#13;
                                                                         aftermath of a disaster. They include the following:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         1.	 Base the design of CDD mechanisms on sound local analysis of the social make-up&#13;
                                                                             environment. For the design of a CDD program to be successful, it must be founded&#13;
                                                                             on a full understanding of the local situation. Beyond the local level damage and&#13;
                                                                             needs assessment, an appropriate analysis is required to look at questions such as:&#13;
                                                                             What social units remain in the aftermath of the disaster that can lend themselves to&#13;
                                                                             the CDD process? What are the capacities of affected communities to work together&#13;
                                                                             and make decisions? How is money managed by local communities? To what extent&#13;
                                                                             have local administrations been affected? And which local leaders are still in place,&#13;
                                                                             capable and trusted? In the case of a major disaster such as the December 2004&#13;
                                                                             tsunami, this analysis must take into account the possibility that the disaster may&#13;
                                                                             have dramatically changed the nature in which social units operate. A village level&#13;
                                                                             post-disaster assessment should therefore include a rapid but thorough analysis of&#13;
                                                                             social conditions if a community driven reconstruction program is to be considered.&#13;
                                                                             Again, having a CDD program in place before disaster strikes that can be scaled up and&#13;
                                                                             adapted for reconstruction is a big advantage.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         2.	 Select a multidisciplinary operational team. A range of skills in community-based&#13;
                                                                             approaches as well as technical expertise and knowledge of government systems&#13;
                                                                             are needed by operational staff and facilitators. Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s positive experience in&#13;
                                                                             implementing CDD programs has been due to a large extent to the ability of the&#13;
                                                                             operational teams to navigate a path between social capital and the unstated ways&#13;
                                                                             in which local institutions form and function on the one hand, and the formal&#13;
                                                                             bureaucratic procedures by which donors and state channel funds on the other. In a&#13;
                                                                             post-disaster reconstruction program, the picture becomes more complex with the&#13;
                                                                             addition of more funds, more actors, greater urgency, and less clarity. Therefore, it is&#13;
                                                                             crucial that a multi-disciplinary team is created that can understand the full complexity&#13;
                                                                             of the post-disaster environment, and has the ability to bring together formal state&#13;
                                                                             and donor institutions with the local institutions in disaster affected communities.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         3.	 Empower local communities to carry out planning and decision making processes for&#13;
                                                                             their own recovery. Providing hands-on opportunities through community planning&#13;
                                                                             exercises and the identification and implementation of physical reconstruction&#13;
                                                                             activities builds skills and capacity for continued community development. Whatever&#13;
                                                                             the design, the planning and decision making processes must be localized with broad&#13;
                                                                             decision making authorities. Furthermore, there should be little intervention from&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      73&#13;
   higher-level authorities beyond facilitation and oversight. This approach has been&#13;

                                                                                             Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia&#13;
                                                                                             Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
   shown in the cases of the JRF and MDF projects to lead to greater levels of local&#13;
   ownership, more appropriate selection of local level reconstruction projects, and&#13;
   more accurate targeting of funds.&#13;
&#13;
4.	 Invest in good facilitators and support their work. All five MDF and JRF community-&#13;
    driven projects concluded that good facilitators; were crucial to the success of&#13;
    the projects. Therefore, they need to be recruited early, continuously trained and&#13;
    supported to do their job. They need to be given the flexibility to adapt to the local&#13;
    environment in which they work, and held accountable for their performance. In&#13;
    difficult conditions, such as heavily impacted or remote areas, additional incentives&#13;
    will be needed to attract and retain good facilitators. This will be the case in any&#13;
    reconstruction program where the demand for local facilitators is high. A network&#13;
    of good facilitators who are available on call is very much worth the investment in&#13;
    human capital, for use in different circumstances and disasters.&#13;
&#13;
5.	 Develop clear and simple systems, procedures and guidelines. Invest in establishing&#13;
    systems as early as possible. Systems, procedures, and guidelines need to be&#13;
    transparent and simple in order for them to be understood by all actors at local&#13;
    level. Facilitating clear understanding of how the entire process works, in terms of&#13;
    steps, scope and timing is important for all actors and will ensure that communities&#13;
    are empowered to participate in the processes.&#13;
&#13;
6.	 Ensure systems, guidelines, and procedures are widely publicized and understood.&#13;
    This will ensure transparency and support greater accountability. Facilitators need&#13;
    to know what to do and communities need to know what their entitlements are.&#13;
    A simple Operations Manual can support greater transparency as does the wide&#13;
    dissemination of information via public information boards. In cases where a pre-&#13;
    existing CDD mechanism is used for post-disaster reconstruction, it is better this is&#13;
    done on the basis of a pre-prepared manual or pre-agreed adjustments for disaster&#13;
    situations.&#13;
&#13;
7.	 Ensure timely distribution of funds. Minimizing unnecessary delays in disbursing&#13;
    funds to community groups is critical for maintaining motivation to participate and&#13;
    keeping commitment and satisfaction levels high. Funds need to be available to&#13;
    disburse to villages in order to build credibility and encourage individuals to invest&#13;
    time and energy in the CDD processes. The best-case scenario is un-earmarked block&#13;
    grants that villagers can plan and prioritize the use of. Once the systems are set up,&#13;
    minimizing unnecessary delays in disbursing funds to community groups is critical&#13;
    for maintaining motivation to participate, and keeping commitment and satisfaction&#13;
    levels high. This is particularly the case in post-disaster reconstruction where&#13;
    responses need to be speedy and where NGOs and donors offer other choices.&#13;

                                                                      up early on. The MIS needs to be able to account for funds used and results achieved,&#13;
                                                                      and show progress during planning and implementation as well as problems&#13;

                                                                      address the quality of participation. Separate groups for women help encourage&#13;
                                                                      and support leadership, and other mechanisms to increase the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

4.3	 Conclusions: Adapting Community Driven Reconstruction in&#13;

                                                                                              Post-Disaster Recovery: Experiences from Indonesia&#13;
                                                                                              Adapting Community Driven Approaches for&#13;
     Other Settings&#13;
      	&#13;
      A key lesson from the experiences of the JRF and the MDF is that pre-existing CDD&#13;
      mechanisms can be adapted for the purposes of local level reconstruction and can&#13;
      bring significant immediate, short, medium and long-term benefits for communities&#13;
      that have suffered from a natural disaster. In Indonesia the government is now taking&#13;
      this approach beyond the MDF and JRF and adapting the community driven approach to&#13;
      post-disaster recovery, especially the Rekompak approach to housing reconstruction,&#13;
      into its national disaster response program and ongoing community empowerment&#13;
      program. Even when pre-existing mechanisms are not in place, community driven&#13;
      approaches to reconstruction can be easily implemented to support local recovery.&#13;
      	&#13;
      Establishing mechanisms for community driven reconstruction in the aftermath of&#13;
      a disaster may not appear to deliver immediate benefits due to the investment of&#13;
      time required. However, by engaging communities from the beginning of the process,&#13;
      community driven reconstruction mechanisms allow communities to experience&#13;
      the reconstruction dividends even before physical works are completed, and are&#13;
      beneficial throughout subsequent stages of reconstruction and beyond. Therefore,&#13;
      the establishment of community driven reconstruction mechanisms should be&#13;
      considered in any major reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
      The MDF and JRF experiences have shown that local level recovery using a community&#13;
      driven approach can result not only in cost-effective physical outputs, but also in&#13;
      empowered communities, with greater capacities and more prepared to face future&#13;
      disasters. In Aceh, Nias and Java, the community driven reconstruction model&#13;
      delivered quality physical outputs and important social benefits, ranging from faster&#13;
      social recovery to more empowered, more resilient communities in the long term.&#13;
      Based on Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience, community driven reconstruction should be&#13;
      considered by policy makers in other contexts as an efficient and effective option&#13;
      for delivering local level recovery and achieving sustainable social benefits for&#13;
      communities affected by disasters.&#13;

          Background to Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s National CDD Experience&#13;
                The concept of using CDD as a part of the government program for poverty reduction&#13;
                in Indonesia was first introduced as part of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s development planning by&#13;
                Presidential Decree by President Soeharto in 1992. However, it was not until 1998,&#13;
                in response to the Asian financial crisis that this principle of involving communities&#13;
                in their own development was captured in a government development program. The&#13;
                Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) started in 1998, and covered over 500 sub-&#13;
                districts. It provided a flexible platform through which the government was able to&#13;
                quickly respond to the stresses and shocks of the Asian financial crisis at local level.&#13;
                After the financial crisis, the KDP program and its urban counterpart, the Urban Poverty&#13;
                Program (UPP), became important elements of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s poverty reduction program.&#13;
                These programs were able to deliver tangible services at local level in a context of&#13;
                large-scale institutional change. Since 2009, under the new name of Program Nasional&#13;
                Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM or Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Community Empowerment&#13;
                Program), the national CDD program is present in all sub-districts, rural and urban,&#13;
                covering all 78,000 villages in Indonesia. The programâ&#128;&#153;s rural component alone&#13;
                encompasses approximately 77.1 million active participants this year and accounts for&#13;
                approximately 1 percent of the national budget (US$1.5 billion).&#13;
&#13;
                The principles behind the PNPM include;&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 A national commitment to a â&#128;&#152;rights-basedâ&#128;&#153; approach to development â&#128;&#147; support at the&#13;
                   highest level of government for involving communities in their own development.&#13;
                   This support has been further strengthened since the December 2004 tsunami and&#13;
                   the multiple disasters in Java.&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Streamlining bureaucracy from central to local government in the disbursement of&#13;
                   funds, thus reducing possibility for corruption of pro-poor programs.&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Increasing community participation through open forums.&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Strengthening traditional community institutions.&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Balancing a top-down approach of development to allow people a voice in directing&#13;
                   development in their locality.&#13;
&#13;
                Use of Direct Transfers&#13;
&#13;
                Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s CDD programs, including those of the MDF and the JRF, make use of&#13;
                government mechanisms to transfer funds directly to community accounts. This&#13;
                mechanism transfers funds directly from a regional office of the national treasury,&#13;
                upon endorsement of the local government project officer, to these local level&#13;
                accounts and to villages when the funds are needed. In this way, funds bypass multiple&#13;
                layers of government bureaucracy and reduce the potential for misuse and corruption&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                         83&#13;

of funds and significantly reduce delays. To give an idea of the amount of funds the&#13;
government channels through this mechanism, the national CDD program, PNPM, in&#13;
2010 channeled approximately US$740 million to roughly 61,000 villages in the fiscal&#13;
year 2009-2010. Roughly US$139 million of these block grant funds was contributed&#13;
by district level governments.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Facilitators&#13;
&#13;
The decision to recruit consultant facilitators, rather than using only local civil servants,&#13;
was initially met with some reluctance. Indeed, facilitators are today still referred to as&#13;
an â&#128;&#152;overheadâ&#128;&#153; cost rather than an investment in local development, capacity building&#13;
and empowerment. However, experience has shown that the independent nature of&#13;
facilitators and their dedicated, full-time service are key factors in the success of CDD&#13;
programs in Indonesia, even more so in disaster recovery situations. Furthermore, the&#13;
PNPM program has created employment for a large number of young graduates and&#13;
has also resulted in a resource base of highly trained individuals who are competent in&#13;
interacting with both civil society and government and improving the social contract.&#13;
&#13;
Initial Stages of KDP and UPP&#13;
&#13;
CDD as a mechanism to deliver local level development became quickly popular with&#13;
local government, many of them adding funds from local budgets to complement&#13;
the block grants coming from central government. A mandatory local government&#13;
contribution was also introduced; and this is now set at between 5-20 percent,&#13;
depending on local fiscal capacity. These funds provide co-financing for village&#13;
investments. This along with program requirements such as the need for the signature&#13;
of the sub- district head for release of funds and mandatory monthly monitoring&#13;
meetings chaired by local officials have ensured that the program is fully integrated&#13;
with government administration at all levels and its results and challenges are well&#13;
known.&#13;
&#13;
The initial stages of KDP and UPP required intense supervision on the part of both&#13;
the World Bank and also the Ministry of Home Affairs, the implementing agency, and&#13;
focused on short-term choices for village level interventions. This focus on delivering&#13;
tangible outputs early on in the program helped to build the credibility at local level&#13;
and encourage communities to invest time, effort and resources. Now additional&#13;
efforts are made to ensure villagers plan for a number of years and that project&#13;
generated priorities and plans are integrated into official local development plans,&#13;
allowing village priorities to better link up to district level local government priorities,&#13;
investments and services.&#13;

            Adapting community driven approaches for
            post-disaster recovery : experiences from Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias
            (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) have played
            significant roles in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias
            and Java, following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia
            in recent years. The MDF and the JRF, which is patterned
            after it, are each considered a highly successful model for
            post-disaster reconstruction. This paper presents the
            lessons from the MDF and JRF's use of large-scale,
            government-implemented community driven development programs
            to deliver reconstruction at the village level in Aceh, Nias
            and Java. It documents how local level recovery using a
            community driven approach can result in not only cost
            effective physical outputs, but also empowered communities
            with greater capacities and more prepared to face future
            disasters. The MDF and JRF experiences have demonstrated
            many less tangible social benefits. These include faster
            social recovery from the impact of disasters and increased
            confidence and capacities of local actors to engage in local
            level planning. Most importantly, the community driven
            approach to reconstruction empowers victims of natural
            disaster to become key agents in their own recovery.
