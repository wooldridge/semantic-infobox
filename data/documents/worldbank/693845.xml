AGRICULTURAL CENSUS AND INFORMATION SERVICE TA PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   In 1996, the agricultural sector (comprising crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries)&#13;
contributed 17 percent of Ecuador's GDP, 47 percent of total exports and provided&#13;
employment for 31 percent of the economically active population. Sector growth responded&#13;
well to the major efforts of the eighties to reform the economy. The abandonment of import-&#13;
substitution industrialization and the liberalization of the exchange rate help explain why&#13;
agricultural GDP grew at 4.0 percent annually from 1982-93, up from only 2.5 percent p.a.&#13;
from 1973-81. However in recent years growth has slowed. The average growth rate for&#13;
1993-1996 was 3.4 percent p a., ranging from -1.7 percent in 1992-93 to 3.9 percent in 1993-&#13;
94. The years of strong growth are associated with booms in banana and shrimp. Increasing&#13;
domestic production problems and external market difficulties cloud the outlook for both.&#13;
Sector growth is currently falling short of its potential. Productivity growth has remained low,&#13;
and production increases are largely derived from an expansion of area under cultivation. The&#13;
key to addressing this broad problem of unrealized sector growth lies in improving&#13;
productivity.&#13;
1.2   Improvements in sector productivity require a sound policy environment. In this&#13;
context, parallel to the Government's stabilization program, which commenced in 1992, a&#13;
reform program was initiated in the agricultural sector. This has advanced satisfactorily: the&#13;
Agricultural Development Law was passed, price controls on all agricultural products were&#13;
eliminated, entrance to the OMC was approved, import restrictions on agricultural&#13;
commodities were reduced and rationalized, and the Ministry of Agriculture was restructured&#13;
and reduced in size. While these measures tend to provide the correct incentives for the&#13;
adoption of productivity increasing technologies by the private agricultural sector, a widespread&#13;
improvement in productivity requires the government provide key public goods. One of these&#13;
vital public goods is information, upon which farmers, traders, processors, and financial agents,&#13;
and the government itself can make decisions. This becomes particularly important as the&#13;
Government moves away from its past broad programs of investments to more targeted&#13;
interventions aimed at helping poor and indigenous people. Unfortunately, the information&#13;
base for public policy and investment decision making in the agricultural sector in Ecuador is&#13;
out-of-date, not disaggregated, and frequently inaccurate. For private decision- makers the&#13;
situation, if anything, is even worse. Sound, basic information for establishing price&#13;
expectations is practically nonexistent.&#13;
1.3    Need for Good Analysis and Reliable Information. While there has always been a&#13;
need for reliable data on which to base decisions, this need is much stronger in today's global&#13;
economy. In a system of open trade, economies become more vulnerable to external shocks&#13;
from, say, an appreciation of the exchange rate or a sharp fall in commodity prices. Based on&#13;
the experiences of other countries, such as Colombia and more recently Peru and Chile,&#13;
Governments in newly opened economies can face enormous pressures, especially in the&#13;
agricultural sector, to reinstate protection and backslide on reforms following shifts in the terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
of trade. Even though all sections of the agricultural community are not affected adversely, one&#13;
needs to avoid the buildup of potential pressure that can lead to backtracking by initiating a&#13;
program of highly targeted interventions, and implementing policies directed at the affected&#13;
groups. This requires accurate pinpointing of the problem for a certain region and/or&#13;
commodity and presupposes the existence of reliable disaggregated data. Data available in&#13;
Ecuador are not up to this task.&#13;
1.4   Poverty alleviation interventions by Government also require such targeting. In spite of&#13;
the substantial progress in macroeconomic and sector policies, underperformance of the&#13;
economy in recent years has worsened the structural problems of rural poverty. Preliminary&#13;
results from the recent poverty assessment mnission indicate that reduction in aggregate&#13;
spending has involved cutbacks to the poor. Moreover, studies also show that the indigenous&#13;
people continue to derive fewer benefits from govemment programs. Although some changes&#13;
in the pattem of public spending have been introduced to protect the vulnerable poor, mainly in&#13;
the from of matching grants such as through FISE, public funds have not been systematically&#13;
directed at poverty and the needs of the indigenous people. One of the reasons behind&#13;
inefficient targeting and formulation of public sector strategy is the lack of reliable information&#13;
necessary for effective interventions.&#13;
1.5    The last Agricultural Census was conducted in 1974 and the data set no longer&#13;
provides a sound basis for decision making. Currently, many public programs rely on small-&#13;
surveys but the quality of all small-surveys, including LSMS, depends on the frames upon&#13;
which their sampling is based. Existing frames render most of these surveys unreliable at best.&#13;
Large-surveys and censuses are required to improve the quality of the frames so that&#13;
subsequent small-samples can be representative of the "population"(the group of households,&#13;
farms, or individuals from which samples are drawn for statistical measurement). To retain the&#13;
efficiency of small surveys in their representation, even in a stable environment, information on&#13;
the structure of the population has to be updated every five to ten years. As such, the&#13;
Government is unable to plan targeted interventions or to develop policies to benefit selected&#13;
group in society. As Ecuador's economy becomes more sophisticated, targeted interventions,&#13;
as opposed to subsidies to large groups, will become more important. Finally, the weak data&#13;
on rural areas adversely affects private sector decision making as well. The lack of reliable&#13;
data on planting intentions and agro-climatic trends leads to wrong decisions and higher costs&#13;
of operation than would be the case with improved information.&#13;
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.6    The project would be the first Bank project to strengthen the rural information systems&#13;
in Ecuador. Because of the Bank's long experience in helping developing countries in&#13;
economic policy making, including agriculture and rural poverty alleviation in countries&#13;
opening their economies, it is uniquely positioned to help Ecuador develop its capability. The&#13;
Bank is particularly concerned about protectionist interests undoing reforms. Similarly, it is in&#13;
the Bank's interest to target public interventions efficiently. The proposed project would&#13;
provide the data, analyses, and the framework for further inquiry on agricultural policy issues&#13;
and issues involving the disenfranchised rural poor.&#13;
1.7    The proposed project is also consistent with the 1996 Bank Poverty Report and the&#13;
1993 Bank Agricultural Sector Review. They recommended: (i) redesigning public programs&#13;
to focus on the needs of the marginal population, particularly the rural poor, and indigenous&#13;
peoples, and (ii) developing an information service to irnprove the public sector's strategy&#13;
formulation, sector plan development, and investrnent planning and execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.8    The private agricultural sector is embarking on a period of uncertainty. Trade&#13;
liberalization and the reduction in government intervention in agricultural markets make the&#13;
sector more vulnerable to conditions on the international and regional markets, fluctuations in&#13;
the exchange rate, and trade policies. Private sector uncertainty is increased by a general lack&#13;
of information on variables of interest to it. Information distribution is biased toward large&#13;
producers and agroindustrialists. The project would significantly increase the dissemination of&#13;
timely and accurate information targeted to the private sector.&#13;
1.9    Participatory Approach. The preparation effort used a " Data User's Requirement&#13;
Study" which helped define the needs of the potential users of the data (see Attachment 3).&#13;
During this study, the challenge was to help the participants--from both the public and private&#13;
sectors-translate their business understanding into articulated information requirements.&#13;
Direct interviews were used over questiomaires since they tend to be passed down to staff&#13;
assistants. These interviews focused upon critical success factors: existing priority information,&#13;
enhancements to existing information, and unmet requirements.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.10   The proposed technical assistance project aims to improve availability, consistency,&#13;
validity, and timeliness of agricultural information to facilitate the decision-making process in&#13;
both the public and private sectors. Information quality and accessibility would be improved&#13;
through: (i) the standardization of collection and processing methodologies to allow&#13;
comparability, cross-examination and verification; (ii) an efficient and user-friendly&#13;
dissemination network, and, (iii) production of demand-driven data analysis.&#13;
1.11   Reliable and up-to-date information would provide a solid base for Government's&#13;
policies by improving (i) policy analysis capacity; (ii) the formulation of sector strategies; (iii)&#13;
programs implementation through a better planning, monitoring and evaluation system; and,&#13;
(iv) the estimation of behavioral relationships in the agricultural sector. Inter-institutional&#13;
coordination is also an important project objective.&#13;
1.12   Timely and accurate relevant information would develop the private sector by (i)&#13;
promoting competition; (ii) reducing bias generated by powerful groups; (iii) lowering&#13;
transaction costs; and, (iv) improving resource allocation&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
1.13   The project will provide technical and financial support to two governmental&#13;
institutions- the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) and the National Statistics and Census&#13;
institute (INEC). The project will support the conceptualization, collection, processing,&#13;
analysis and dissemination of agricultural and rural information through activities under five&#13;
project components:&#13;
(a)    Agricultural Policy Process (MAG, US$3.2 million,14% of base costs). This&#13;
component will: (i) strengthen sector policy analysis capacity; and, (ii)&#13;
strengthen the budget analysis and investment monitoring and evaluation&#13;
process at MAG.&#13;
(b)    Agricultural Information and Dissemination Service (MAG, US$3.0&#13;
million, 13% of base costs). This component will improve: (i) information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
services on crops and livestock; (ii) market prices and news services of MAG,&#13;
(iii) agroclimatic impact evaluations; and (iv) MAG Computer Center services.&#13;
(c)   Agricultural Sample Census (INEC, US$11.6 million, 50% of base costs).&#13;
This component will support the design, preparation, and execution of the&#13;
national ASC and strengthen INEC's data processing capacity.&#13;
(d)   Agricultural Farm Production Survey (INEC, US$1.6 million, 7% of base&#13;
costs). This component will improve the national agricultural production&#13;
survey methodologically, speed processing turn-around, conduct two&#13;
production surveys per year to improve relevance for decision making, and&#13;
execute two farm expenditure surveys during the life of the project.&#13;
(e)    Project Management (US$3.8 million, 16% of base costs). This component&#13;
will design and implement the overall information service and establish and&#13;
operate the project management and implementation units, responsible for&#13;
coordination, planning, financial administration, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
1.14   The combined output of these separate components leads to a sector information&#13;
service for policy analysis and decision making. The information requirements for policy&#13;
analysis and decision making are largely determined from economic theory, country&#13;
experience, and the Data-User's Requirements. The primary classes of data and information&#13;
required are:&#13;
*  Dynamic Economic Variables. These include economic variables that can change&#13;
in the very short-term. Prices are the main element, and include macroeconomic&#13;
prices such as exchange and interest rates, and sector prices such as border prices,&#13;
international prices, domestic prices at the farm, wholesale, processor, consumer&#13;
levels, input prices. These are collected from secondary sources and by direct&#13;
observation, processed and organized by the Price and Market News Service,&#13;
under Component B.&#13;
*  Stock Variables. Changes in quantities are primary factors for explaining price&#13;
changes These include macroeconomic variables such as intemational reserves,&#13;
balance of payments, and monetary emission, and sector variables such as&#13;
commodity production and stock levels, area planted and harvested, yields,&#13;
commodity imports and exports in volume and value, fertilizer use, supply of&#13;
credit, area under irrigation, livestock numbers, etc. Intemational and regional&#13;
production and stocks of relevant commodities are also important. Changes in&#13;
weather conditions are an important factor in explaining commodity production and&#13;
yield changes. This data and information is collected from secondary sources and&#13;
from surveys, processed and organized, under Components B and D.&#13;
*  Structural Variables. These variables change but slowly overtime and describe the&#13;
characteristics of the production and marketing systems. They include such&#13;
variables as average farm size, number of farms by farm size, technology levels by&#13;
farm size, tenure characteristics, social and educational characteristics of farm&#13;
families, number and capacity of processors, sources of rural income, marketing&#13;
channels, income and expenditure pattems. This sort of data is provided by&#13;
relatively large sample surveys or census. Much of this data and information will&#13;
be supplied by the ASC, Component C of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.15   The above classes of information, well organized and timely, provide analysts and&#13;
decision makers with the data required to describe and understand a problem, forecast&#13;
alternative scenarios, and evaluate the impact of alternative interventions on target groups.&#13;
Public and private decision-makers rarely use data; they use the analysis of data. Data is&#13;
transformed into useful information by analysis. Thus, the project will strengthen the technical&#13;
capacity of the analytical units in the MAG, under Component A, as an essential feature of an&#13;
effective and useful information service.&#13;
COMPONENT A: AGRICULTURAL POLICY PROCESS&#13;
(US$3.24 million, 14 percent of base costs)&#13;
1.16   This component will finance equipment, technical assistance, training and incremental&#13;
operating costs for three MAG directorates: (i) Policy Analysis, (ii) Intemal and Extemal&#13;
Trade, and (iii) Planning, Investment and Budgeting. The component will strengthen the&#13;
capacity of MAG to appraise and evaluate the impact of sector policies and to disseminate the&#13;
results of these analyses. It will comprise the following two sub-components.&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT:                    A1-Sectoral and Trade Policy&#13;
IMPLEMENTING UNITS:               SICA/MAG and Policy Undersecretary&#13;
BASE COST:                        US$2.7 million&#13;
1.17   The sub-component will strengthen the capacity of the Policy Undersecretary to&#13;
evaluate, analyze, and provide the public and private agricultural sectors with information&#13;
relevant to the market situation and agricultural policies. The analyses and mformation will&#13;
include (i) market situation and outlook, (ii) macroeconomic, including exchange rate policy,&#13;
related to agriculture, (iii) sector, such as price and trade policy, and (iv) sub-sector and&#13;
product-specific policies related to market efficiency. It will produce and disseminate various&#13;
types of products, including situation and outlook, sector reviews, policy memoranda and&#13;
market analyses. These reports and analytical documents will be distributed to a wide audience&#13;
in the public and private sectors through publications, seminars, the press, and Internet.&#13;
1.18   This sub-component will be user oriented and will promote a dialogue between the&#13;
public and private sectors. The Data User's Requirements Study (see Attachment 3) indicates&#13;
that the private sector needs, in addition to data, the interpretative analysis of the same. Data&#13;
must be accompanied by a descriptive analysis that helps decision-makers understand the&#13;
impact of a policy or of market changes. Although the existing information system covers&#13;
some of these requirements, it is incomplete. The chief technical limitation is the capacity of&#13;
the team responsible for preparing policy memoranda and sector and sub-sector reviews. A&#13;
higher level of economic reasoning and application of analytical techniques is required. The&#13;
methodologies needed for policy memoranda include a policy analysis matrix, linear&#13;
programming, and analysis of single and multiple markets. Specifically, it is important to&#13;
understand the limitations of these techniques, to decide which is appropriate in each case, and&#13;
interpret the results. The project will provide training and technical assistance to the staff of the&#13;
Project to develop this capacity.&#13;
1.19   Similarly, dissemination of information will be significantly improved. Private&#13;
institutions (such as associations of producers, agroindustrialists, agricultural centers and&#13;
boards) will be used to distribute the reports among their members and a continuing and&#13;
systematic series of seminars will be held with these institutions. In addition to being venues&#13;
for providing the private sector with information and analysis, seminars also provide analysts&#13;
with feedback from the private sector, allowing an improved dialog between analysts and&#13;
clients. The demand for seminars, particularly by agricultural associations on the coast, on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
topics related to the market oudook for products and trade liberalization, now outstrips the&#13;
response capacity of MAG.&#13;
1.20  The sub-component requirements include: (i) 34 person months of short-tem tecmical&#13;
assistance in economic trade policy, economic modeling and analysis, and extension&#13;
economics; (ii) short-term training courses; (iii) incremental staff and salaries; (iv) upgraded&#13;
1T facilities, including the purchase of 30 micro-computers and network installation; (v)&#13;
funding for seminars, publications, and information disseminaion to the private sector; (vi)&#13;
incremental operating costs; and (vii) support to extemal MS degree training in agricultural&#13;
economics.&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT:                   Sector Public Investment&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION UNITS             SICA/MAG, Sector InvestmentlMAG&#13;
Budget and Public Credit, Ministry of Finance&#13;
BASE COST:                       US$0.53 million&#13;
1.21   The purposes of this sub-component are to provide the GOE with the information and&#13;
analysis required to: (i) increase the capacity of MAG and the Finance Ministry to effecfively&#13;
monitor and evaluate the performance of MAG investments in programs, projects, and&#13;
services; (ii) link investment policy more closely to sector policies and priorities, (iii) target&#13;
policy and investments to vulnerable groups that require public support, and (iv) make greater&#13;
use of nongovenmnental agencies in agricultural and rura services. To attain these goals, the&#13;
project will set up a small budget analysis unit with staff capable of conducting the required&#13;
analysis.&#13;
1.22  The main products of this unit will be (i) annual analysis of the investment budget,&#13;
monitored according to sub-sector, region, target group, and type of investment; (ii) anmual and&#13;
semiannual analysis of MAG's budget (programming versus execution, region and beneficiary&#13;
groups); (ii) periodic reports on the cost-effectiveness of programs and projects; and, (iv)&#13;
periodic evaluations of the impact of programs and projects.&#13;
1.23   The sub-component requirements include: (i) 96 person months of long-term technical&#13;
assistance (national); (iii) short-term training; (iv) upgrading of IT facilities and purchase of 4&#13;
microcomputers; and (v) assistance with incremental operating costs; and (vi) incremental&#13;
salaries.&#13;
COMPONENT B: AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION AND DISSEMINATION&#13;
SERVICE&#13;
(USS2.99 million, 13 percent of base costs)&#13;
1.24  This component will provide support for the collection, processing, and organtion of&#13;
the basic agricultural statistics regarding crop and livestock production, area, yield, market&#13;
prices, production costs and weather. Four divisions of the MAG's Agricultural Information&#13;
Directorate are involved in the collection and processing of this information: (i) Agricultural&#13;

1.25 The Project will support the Agricultural Stafistics Division (ASD) in the design,&#13;
implementation, and maintenance of the sector database. The database will be composed&#13;
largely from secondary sources: macroeconomic data from the Central Bank; agricultural&#13;
production data from INEC; price and weadter data from other sections of the MAG, etc. The&#13;
data and infonnation from the sector database will be diseminaed through vaious means,&#13;
including Intemet, publications, and statistical buletins.&#13;
1.26 The ASD will organize and disseminate this information through periodic statistical&#13;
buletins and reports. In addition, funding is provided for three specialized surveys for needs to&#13;
be determined during project implementatiorL&#13;
1.27 The sub-component requirements include: (i) 36 person months of a long-term&#13;

1.28 The Market Price and News Service will provide relevant and timely informafion&#13;
services including the following: (i) summary reports of daily prices for a selected group of&#13;
important products; (ii) summary of weekly and monthly process for a full range of products;&#13;
and, (iii) a price consultation service that allows users to specify the markets and products in&#13;
which they are interested. Price information will also be provided through the Intemret&#13;
1.29 To improve the quality and timing of the information provided by the Market Prices&#13;
and News Service, the project will provide support in the following areas:&#13;
* Supervision and training of field personnel to improve the quality of the data.&#13;
* Standardization of methodologies and criteria for weights and measures of farm&#13;
produce to improve comparability.&#13;
* Collection and dissemination of non-price news that is relevant for understanding&#13;
the market situation. For example, weather conditions, strikes and communicatons&#13;
problems can affect the flow of produce to the market&#13;
* Improved dissemination of information through the use of radio and mass media to&#13;
reach small farmers. Radio is the most cost-effective dissemination method,&#13;
particularly in remote and mountainous areas.&#13;
* Upgrading of computer and communications equipment most of which has not&#13;
been upgraded since 1987, particularly in the field offices.&#13;
&#13;

BASE COST:                       US$1.37 million&#13;
1.31 This division receives weather data, principally precipitation and temperature, from the&#13;
National Meteorology and Hydrology Institute (INAMI, and organizes and analyzes the data&#13;
in conjunction with crop phenology to determine the likely impact of weather anomalies and&#13;
variability on crop production. Because of the relatively low use of modern production inputs&#13;
and the small area under irrigation, weather and rainfall are primary determinants of crop&#13;
yields. The project will provide support to improve the collection, processing, analysis and&#13;
dissemination of this information. Specifically the project will:&#13;
*  Analyze, plan, and design the expansion and upgrading of the network of&#13;
meteorological stations in a cost-effective manner to increase geographical&#13;
coverage, accuracy and tifeliness. In a phased manner, up to 30 additional agro-&#13;
meteorological stations may be brought into the network. Initial installations would&#13;
take place in pnority agricultural areas, and expansion will depend upon the&#13;
evaluation of the effectiveness of the new system and the demonstrated capacity of&#13;
INAMH to maintain and operate the installations.&#13;
* Evaluate the purchase of a new satellite receiver system, which will permit the&#13;
transmission of data automatically collected by the meteorological stations through&#13;
the GOES-8 satellite.&#13;
*  Data elaboration with modem technologies, such as thematic maps.&#13;
* Implementation of an early warning service on climatic phenomena, such as frosts,&#13;
floods, or pests.&#13;
*  Monitoring and evaluation of information related to climatic anomalies, such as&#13;
droughts and El Ninlo.&#13;
*  Timely dissemination of results that are relevant to users' requirements.&#13;
1.32  The sub-component requirements include: (i) 8 person months of short-term technical&#13;
assistance in ago-meteorology; (ii) 36 person months of long-term technical assistance&#13;
(national); (iii) 4 short-term training courses in agro-meteorology; (iv) installation of up to&#13;
additional 35 automatic meteorological stations and a satellite antenna; and, (v) assistance with&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;

IMLEENTING UNITS: SICA/MAG and Agricultural nformation Directorate&#13;
BASE COST:                 USSO.38 million&#13;
1.33   The computer center will provide tecmical asistnce, traiing, data processing&#13;
systems development and maintenance and repair services. Presenty, the lack of appropriae&#13;
equipment and technical capacty impede the effective accomplishment of these sevices. lhe&#13;
project uill help the Computer Center to improve the following services:&#13;
*  Mainace and repair. The division will maintain a reserve of the basic parts th&#13;
are needed to reduce equipment downtime.&#13;
* Training for computer users. A small and adequately equipped training center will&#13;
offer courses in standard software packages such as Windows, Excel, Word,&#13;
graphical packages, databases, network, and other special applications. Advanced&#13;
courses will also become available.&#13;
* Technical assistance for users. Direct support for all PC users in solving specific&#13;
hardware and software problems is a key factor to help MAG staff perform their&#13;
functions.&#13;
*  Systems development. The Computer Center has programmers able to devlop&#13;
and install specific systems. The project will provide technical assistance to update&#13;
the Center's capability to respond to the new demands that will arise with the new&#13;
equipment, software, and particularly with networks.&#13;
* Publications production. This service will graphically format and edit reports and&#13;
publications. By doing so, the technical staff of other divisions wiU be discharged&#13;
from these responsibilities, allowing them to dedicate more attention to the&#13;
technical detail of their tasks.&#13;
1.34   For technological modernization, the installation of Intemet and Intranet is paramount&#13;
Its justifications include lowered costs due to: (i) shared peripheral equipment; (ii) shared&#13;
software and reduction of license requirements and costs; and, (iii) an efficient multi-user&#13;
system for transferring ffles and information sharing. The project will provide equipment and&#13;
haning to install and operate this technology.&#13;
1.35   The sub-component requirements include: (i) 3 person/months of short-term technical&#13;
assstance in information admiation tion and management; (ii) 8 short-term training courses on&#13;

1.36  This component will provide technical and financial support for the Agricultural&#13;
Sample Census in all its stages, from design and preparation, through implementation and data&#13;
processing, to result dissemination. The component is divided into two sub-components: (CI)&#13;
Agricultural Sample Census, which covers preparation, implementation and result&#13;
dissemination and (C2) Data Processing, to strengthen and modernize the data processing&#13;
capabilities of INEC's computer center.&#13;

BASE COST:                        US$10.66 million&#13;
1.37  The purpose of this sub-component is to support the collection of structural data on&#13;
Ecuadorian agriculture. These data include (i) production systems; (ii) on-farm resource use&#13;
(land, labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure), (iii) land tenancy; and, (iv) socio-economic&#13;
characteristics of the farm household.&#13;
1.38  The major preparation activity under this component is updating and completing the&#13;
Area Sampling Frame for the whole country. Satellite imagery will be used to update areas of&#13;
the country for which aerial photography is not available or not current, particularly the eastern&#13;
lowlands. Aerial photographs will be required for selected areas to complement the satellite&#13;
image. For cities and towns, cartographic information from the recent population and housing&#13;
census will be used to locate segments in these strata. Moreover, the use of a multiple&#13;
sampling frame that takes into consideration lists of producers will provide adequate coverage&#13;
of special products and/or producers.&#13;
1.39 The sample census will compile information from approximately 250,000&#13;
questionnaires administered throughout the country, out of a total of approximately 897,000&#13;
farms or Agricultural Production Units (UPAs) in Ecuador. The sample size has been&#13;
designed to optirnize data significance and mmimize costs by balancing sampling and non-&#13;
sampling error.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
1.40   To reduce sampling errors, the information already available will be used to stratify the&#13;
sample. Accordingly, the sampling methodology will be based on a multiple sampling frame.&#13;
This methodology is a combination of the area sampling frame (where the population is&#13;
grouped in geographical units or strata) with a list of population (where the grouping is based&#13;
on different criteria, such as farm area, or type of land ownership). The use of the lists of&#13;
population is necessary when the sampling errors with the area frame are too large. This is the&#13;
case, for example, when one individual accounts for a large percentage of the total population,&#13;
or when the surveyed product is specialized, such as flowers, mangos, etc. The list of&#13;
population will be kept as short as possible to be manageable. The frame will be designed so&#13;
that it could also be used for other surveys. In fact, an important project objective is to unify&#13;
the methodologies used in all agricultural surveys.&#13;
1.41   The main results expected from the sub-component are: (i) an updated and complete&#13;
area sampling frame to be used for all agricultural surveys; (ii) data on agricultural production,&#13;
practices and farm structure, desegregated at canton level; (iii) documentation on surveying&#13;
methodology and execution; (iv) publication and dissemination of the results; (v) wide&#13;
availability of data series in electronic formats; (vi) seminars for policy analysts and other data&#13;
users to explain how to use the data sets; and, (vii) seminars for the general public and&#13;
farmers.&#13;
1.42   The project will provide technical assistance to INEC in the following areas: (i)&#13;
updating the sampling frame and designing and selecting the sample; (ii) design the&#13;
questionnaire and tabulation formats; (iii) pilot test of questionnaires, field procedures and data&#13;
entry process; (iv) data collection; and, (v) dissemination of results through publication of&#13;
reports as well as through electronic media. The technical assistance requirements in data&#13;
processing (C2) and for AFPS (D) are included under the Census Component because of the&#13;
interrelationships among the components.&#13;
1.43   The sub-component requirements include: (i) 42 person months of short-term technical&#13;
assistance in survey planning and management, mathematical statistics, survey statistics, and&#13;
systems analysis and data processing; (ii) 12 short-term training courses in survey design,&#13;
sampling, and survey statistics; (iii) incremental staff and salaries; (iv) 3 5 vehicles; (v) 45&#13;
micro computers; (vi) service contracts to procure temporary cartographers for updating maps&#13;
and area frame; (vii) service contracts to procure interviewers, enumerators, and transport to&#13;
the field (car rental); and, (viii) logistical support in the field and other operating costs.&#13;

SUB-COMPONENT:                  C2- Data Processing&#13;
IMPLEMENTING UNIT:              Computer Division (INEC)&#13;
BASE COST:                      US$0.920 million&#13;
1.44   Processing the information collected from the Agricultural Sample Census will require&#13;
substantial effort from INEC. Presently, INEC's processing capability is weak. This sub-&#13;
component will boost INEC's processing capacity, to the benefit of the entire institution, not&#13;
just for the project activities. The project will also support the efforts underway to decentralize&#13;
INEC, particularly in the data processing area.&#13;
1.45   The project will significantly improve the operations of INEC's data processing unit to&#13;
provide the following services: (i) data processing,; (ii) training and technical assistance for&#13;
computer users; (iii) systems development for survey processing; (iv) maintenance and repair;&#13;
(v) information technology monitoring; and, (vi) publications production. The main&#13;
characteristics of this sub-component are similar to those described for the support of MAG's&#13;
computer center. To avoid the high employee turnover due to the attractive salaries paid by the&#13;
private sector to computer technicians, young professionals fresh from universities and&#13;
technical schools will be hired.&#13;
1.46   The sub-component requirements include: (i) 30 computers and software; (ii)&#13;
equipment for the installation of a network; (iii) 6 short-term training courses; (iv) assistance&#13;
with operating costs,; and, (v) incremental salaries.&#13;
COMPONENT D: AGRICULTURAL FARM PRODUCTION SURVEY (AFPS)&#13;
(US$1.6 million, 7 percent of base costs)&#13;
Implementing Unit: INEC&#13;
1.47   This component will provide technical and financial support to incorporate the results&#13;
of the Agricultural Sample Census in the area frame of the Agricultural Farm Production&#13;
Survey (AFPS), which is carried out annually by MEC. The AFPS provides estimates of&#13;
production for a wide array of agncultural products, including livestock. INEC has been&#13;
implementing this survey since 1981. Approximately 70,000 UPAs are surveyed each year&#13;
between September and November. The results, which are available the following March,&#13;
estimate national production, yields and area for 33 crop and livestock products during the&#13;
previous year.&#13;
1.48   The Agricultural Farm Production Survey (AFPS) is particularly important for the&#13;
MAG and the agricultural sector, as the survey provides the only objective annual data on crop&#13;
production, area and yields. However, its usefulness is significantly limited because the results&#13;
only become available eight months after the major winter harvest. In recent years the MAG&#13;
has conducted a survey of Coastal agricultural production in the July-August period,&#13;
immediately following the harvest, to estimate the winter harvest of principal commodities&#13;
(rice, corn, soybeans, coffee, cacao, and banana), however this survey has suffered from major&#13;
difficulties due to the MAG's human resource constraints for survey work and supervision.&#13;
Therefore, under the project, NEC will conduct a small Coastal Production survey each July-&#13;
August during the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
1.49 A recent evaluation of the AFPS survey has identified the following additional&#13;
shortcomings:&#13;
*  Incomplete sampling frame. The frame in use was created in 1981. Since its&#13;
creation, the agricultural frontier has expanded significantly around roads and&#13;
urban areas. Moreover, the sampling frame methodology is of limited use for&#13;
specialized products such as flowers, mangos, etc. Additionally there has been&#13;
inadequate sample rotation.&#13;
*  Excessively prolonged process. The 8-9 weeks presently used for data collection,&#13;
plus the 10-11 weeks for data processing, are excessive.&#13;
*  Insufficient use of sampling frame. The construction and maintenance of the frame&#13;
represents a significant investment, yet it is used for but one survey per year and&#13;
for only one class of data, agricultural production data.&#13;
1.50  The project will address these limitations by providing technical assistance and&#13;
financial support to obtain:&#13;
*  An improved sampling frame that will incorporate new areas and specialized crops,&#13;
using the updated area sampling frame that will be created in the Agricultural&#13;
Sample Census component.&#13;
*  More timely data. The time elapsed for fieldwork and processing will be reduced&#13;
through improved survey design and stratification and through the improvement of&#13;
data processing systems (described in sub-component C2).&#13;
*  Improved utilization of the sampling frame. In addition to improvements in the&#13;
AFPS, the AFPS unit in INEC will design and execute an annual survey of Coastal&#13;
production following the winter harvest, based upon a sub-sample of the AFPS&#13;
sample and will design and execute every two years a survey to determine farm&#13;
expenditures and costs of production.&#13;
1.51   The sub-component requirements include: (i) 8 person months of short-term technical&#13;
assistance in mathematical statistics, sampling, and area frame construction (included under the&#13;
Census component); (ii) service contracts to construct the frame, including satellite imagery,&#13;
aerial photography, and data collection; and, (iii) 4 short courses in statistical sampling and&#13;
survey design.&#13;
&#13;

COMPONENT E: PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
(US$3.8 million, 16 percent of base costs)&#13;
Implementing Units:    Technical Secretariat and INEC Implementation Unit&#13;
1.52 The purpose of this component is to establish the management structures responsible&#13;
for the direction, coordination, planiing, financial administration, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the project (see next chapter on Project Management). A Technical Secretariat,&#13;
headed by a Director, International Technical Advisor and a small managerial and financial&#13;
staff will be responsible for overall project management and guidance, including direct&#13;
management and administration of the activities in the MAG. A small Implementation Unit in&#13;
INEC will administer implementation of the INEC components, under the direction of the&#13;
Director of Economic Studies/Director of Census. In addition, this component will develop&#13;
managerial slills within the government essential for the implementation of any kind of activity;&#13;
and further develop the inter-institutional collaboration between MAG and INEC.&#13;
1.53   The component requirements include: (i) 48 person months of a Project Director,&#13;
managerial, administrative and financial staff of the Technical Secretariat and the INEC&#13;
Implementation Unit; (ii) 48 person months of an Intemational Technical Advisor in&#13;
agricultural economics, statistics and project management assigned to the Technical&#13;
Secretariat; (iii) 4 vehicles; (iv) funds for monitoring, evaluation, and audits; and, (v) support&#13;
for operating costs. The Technical Secretariat will be funded entirely by Loan funds.&#13;

per diems, trainng facilites rentals, and matenals required for traimng acvites. The&#13;
institios will follow Bank's gdelines to recruit private consulting firms, oher institutions,&#13;
mdividual consultants and specialists. Consultng services would be procured in accorde&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
with the 1997 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Moreover, QCBS would be used&#13;
in all cases except where individual consultants would provide the type of services indicated in&#13;
Section 5.1 of the above Guidelines, including work on surveys and post-survey work. During&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that MAG and INEC will use standard Letters of Invitation and&#13;
Contracts for simple assignments and the Bank's standard form of Contract for complex time-&#13;
based assignments.&#13;
2.7   Service Contracts (US$8.4 million). Service contracts will be used to procure&#13;
temporary workers for implementing the surveys. These services will be procured through&#13;
NCB when a firm or an organization can supply them. For instance, the filling of&#13;
questionnaires for a certain area could be contracted to a private firm or NGO that will train&#13;
and supervise temporary interviewers. In other cases, INEC and MAG will directly contract,&#13;
train and supervise the temporary interviewers. The services of survey work and post-survey&#13;
work in Components C and D would be procured in accordance with the 1996 Bank&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and Works.&#13;
2.8   Equipment (US$0.7 mnillion). Procurement procedures would be applied according to&#13;
the following thresholds: (i) contracts costing less than US$50,000 (aggregate US$500,000):&#13;
local shopping through direct invitation of at least three suppliers; and (i) contracts costing&#13;
above US$50,000 (aggregate US$3,500,000): national competitive bidding (NCB). NCB&#13;
procedures would use the Bank's standard bidding documents, modified as necessary to meet&#13;
project requirements.&#13;
2.9   Vehicles (US$1.7 million). ICB will be normally used for the procurement of this&#13;
category. In most cases, procurement will be grouped in packages costing above US$250,000.&#13;
Only during the start up phase will the project be allowed to purchase through national&#13;
shopping of a maximum of 5 vehicles for a total value of US$114,000 or less.&#13;
2.10 Civil Works (US$23,000). Only small works (all estimated to be below US$30,000&#13;
per contract) are expected to be financed under lump sum contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors.&#13;
2.11   Reviewing Procedures. Procedures, documents, procurement evaluation, and award of&#13;
contracts are subject to prior review by the Bank according to the following thresholds: (i) all&#13;
procurement through ICB; (ii) NCB for contracts costing above US$50,000; (iii) procurement&#13;
of consulting firms for contracts costing above US$100,000 (above US$200,000 would also&#13;
require an additional review of Evaluation Report); and, (iv) procurement of individual&#13;
consultants for contracts costing above US$25,000. Total prior review by the Bank will cover&#13;
at least 80 percent of procurement. The terms of reference for the auditing services will&#13;
require the auditors to certify that procurements have been made using bid documents agreed&#13;
upon with the Bank, and that the documents submitted to the Bank for prior review are&#13;
representative. Moreover, the Bank will review local procurements and tendering procedures&#13;
on the basis of an ex post sample. If it is found that the procedures agreed upon have not been&#13;
followed, the Bank will not finance the purchase in question and will cancel the amount from&#13;
the loan.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
2.12   The loan of US$20.0 million is expected to be disbursed over a period of four years,&#13;
beginning the first quarter of CY 1998 through the end of the first quarter of CY2002. The&#13;
project completion data will be March 31, 2002 and the closing date will be September 30,&#13;
2002. The disbursement profile presented below (and in attachment 7) is consistent with the&#13;
Bank's standard disbursement profile for technical assistance projects.&#13;

technical assistance, vehicles and equipment, training, and service contracts. The loan will&#13;
contribute to finance incremental recurrent costs such as incremental salaies and incremental&#13;
operation and maintenance costs which would progressively decrease during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

2.14   Special Account. A Special Account (SA) in US dollars will be opened at a qualified&#13;
commercial bank. The SA will have one sub-account, for INEC. The total initial deposit will&#13;
be US$1.5 million, corresponding to about four months of average disbursement. The&#13;
Technical Secretariat (as part of MAG) will prepare and submit requests for withdrawals on&#13;
account of eligible expenditures for the Borrower. The TS Director will be responsible for&#13;
preparing replenishment applications.&#13;
2.15   Statement of Expenditure. Withdrawal applications will normally be supported by full&#13;
documentation. However, all expenditures for a contract value below the prior review, will be&#13;
made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOE). The related supporting documents will&#13;
be maintained by the TS and will be available for Bank staff and auditors review. All other&#13;
expenditures would require full documentation.&#13;
2.16   Retroactive Financing. Reimbursement of up to US$1.5 million-less than eight&#13;
percent of loan amount-will be permitted for eligible expenditures and that follow Bank&#13;
procedures for procurement, processing and clearance. The period to be covered under&#13;
retroactive financing starts on September 1, 1997. If the Loan Agreement is signed after&#13;
September 1, 1998, the initial date for eligibility of expenditures for retroactive financing will&#13;
be modified so that the period covered by retroactive financing will be no more than 12 months&#13;
before date of loan signing. Retroactive financing is recommended to ensure the technical&#13;
assistance necessary for those activities already undertaken by the implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
Project Management&#13;
2.17   The Project will be implemented by two public sector institutions, the Policy and&#13;
Sector Investment Under-Secretariat of the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Statistics&#13;
and Census Institute. While MAG is responsible for agricultural policy, INEC is in charge of&#13;
the national statistics system (Ley de Estadistica No. 323, Mayo 7, 1976). In Attachment 2&#13;
there is a comprehensive description of the two implementing institutions.&#13;
2.18   To ensure collaboration between the two institutions, the project management structure&#13;
(see Figure 1) will be composed of the following: a Technical Secretariat (TS), a Consultative&#13;
Council, and a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in INEC. The Technical Secretariat, located&#13;
in the MAG, will also manage the implementation of the MAG components. A detailed&#13;
agreement between the Technical Secretariat and INEC describing project management&#13;
functions and responsibilities under the PPF has been signed. The agreement defines (i)&#13;
functions, responsibilities, and organization of the INEC/PIU; (ii) procurement responsibilities&#13;
for consultants, goods, and services; (iii) responsibilities for monitoring; (iv) accounting and&#13;
disbursement responsibilities; and, (v) auditing arrangements. The signing of a similar&#13;
agreement between the TS and the INEC describing project management functions and&#13;
responsibilities under the Loan Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of&#13;
Components C and D.&#13;
2.19   The Consultative Council will be composed of the Minister of Agriculture, the&#13;
Director General of INEC, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, and representatives&#13;
from the private agricultural sector. The Council must approve any changes in the Directorship&#13;
of the Technical Secretariat that may be requested by Minister of Agriculture, as well as review&#13;
project annual plans and strategies.&#13;
2.20   The Technical Secretariat will be responsible for overall project management,&#13;
including: (i) establishment of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and auditing activities; (ii)&#13;
establishment of project strategies and implementation guidelines; (iii) facilitating coordination&#13;
between project institutions; (iv) contracting extemal technical assistance and offshore&#13;
procurement of goods in accordance with Bank guidelines; (v) establishment of administrative&#13;
and financial systems and procedures; (vi) management and administration of the MAG&#13;
components; (vii) management and technical support to the institutions; (viii) documentation&#13;
and reporting to the Consultative Council and to the World Bank regarding project status; and&#13;
(ix) project accounting, disbursements, and reporting to the World Bank. The Technical&#13;
Secretariat has been established and the TS director has taken office.&#13;
2.21   The INEC Project Implementation Unit (INEC/PIU) will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of Components C and D of the project, including: (i) administration and&#13;
accounting of local expenditures and local procurement; (ii) planning, monitoring, and&#13;
supervising the implementation of Components C and D; (iii) reporting technical and financial&#13;
documentation to INEC management and to the Technical Secretariat; (iv) local procurement&#13;
of consultants, goods, and services in accordance with Bank guidelines and TS instructions;&#13;
and (v) internal auditing. Establishment of the INEC/PIU is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
2.22   The project components are tailored to the existing institutional structure (see Figure&#13;
1). By doing so, responsibilities for implementation of individual components are clearly&#13;
demarcated among the existing institutional units.&#13;

Project Implementation&#13;
2.23  Implementation Plan. An implementation plan and schedule have been jointly prepared&#13;
during appraisal (see Attachment 8 and Attachment 9), and was agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations. During negotiations it was also agreed that TS and INEC-PIU will annually&#13;
present a detailed implementation schedule for the following year for Bank review. The&#13;
detailed implementation schedule of the first year (with particular care on ASC preparation),&#13;
has already been review during appraisal.&#13;
2.24   Operations Manual. The TS will prepare a detailed project Operations Manual. This&#13;
manual will contain: (i) internal procedures for procurement of civil works, goods, services,&#13;
and for recruitment of consultants; (ii) terms of reference for the consultants, sample&#13;
consulting contracts, and samnple bidding documents; (iii) disbursement procedures. The Bank&#13;
will review the manual. A draft Operations Manual was prepared before negotiations and the&#13;
adoption of the agreed manual will be a condition of project effectiveness.&#13;
2.25 Agricultural Sample Census. The ambitious plan to implement this activity in 1998&#13;
requires a special implementation effort from INEC. The PPF is necessary to further proceed&#13;
in the preparation of the ASC and to have access to the required technical assistance.&#13;
Therefore, the preparation and submission to the Bank of the terms of reference estimated&#13;
budget, and draft contract for contracting Technical Assistance is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
2.26   The Technical Secretariat and INEC/PIU will establish and maintain separate project&#13;
accounts to record all project transactions from the commencement of project execution. Each&#13;
institution will be responsible for establishing the accounts. The TS will consolidate all project&#13;
accounts. Such accounts shall be maintained in accordance with internationally and locally&#13;
recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. The accounting&#13;
system will be divided by sub-component, expenditure category, disbursement account,&#13;
implementing institution, and will consolidate these accounts to prepare financial reports. The&#13;
supporting documentation will be kept in the INEC/PIU and TS and will be available at any&#13;
time for review by the Government, Bank Missions, and/or independent auditors.&#13;
2.27 The TS will ensure that the INEC/PIU uses standard operating, administrative and&#13;
accounting procedures (set out in the Operations Manual) on: accounting, accounting plan,&#13;
budgeting, administrative and financial reports. The TS will provide-within three months&#13;
after the close of the fiscal year-annual financial statements to reflect the financial&#13;
performance of the project. An independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank will be&#13;
competitively selected by the TS and hired to provide an opinion on such statements. The&#13;
auditor's report will be provided within four months of the close of the fiscal year and will&#13;
include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting system and intemal controls, the&#13;
reliability of financial statements and SOEs as a basis for loan disbursements. The auditing and&#13;
accounting arrangements was agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
2.28  Project implementation will be monitored by the TS. The Government and the Bank&#13;
will monitor project progress during joint supervision missions. A Mid-Term Review and an&#13;
Implementation Completion Review will be held at appropriate times during the life of the&#13;
project. Project monitoring and supervision arrangements was agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
2.29  Monitoring. The TS will provide semester reports to the Minister of Agriculture, the&#13;
Director of INEC, and the Bank. The reports will contain information on progress, collection,&#13;
processing, analysis, and distribution of information and an evaluation of the effects on&#13;
decision-makers. The semester reports will be furnished to the Bank no later than two months&#13;
after the completion of each semester. The key monitoring indicators are detailed in&#13;
Attachment 8 and described in the Operations Manual.&#13;
2.30 Regular Supervision. Twice a year, the Bank and the Government will organize joint&#13;
supervision missions. Before each mission, the Government and the Bank will agree on the&#13;
major substantive issues to be dealt with. These missions will always include an evaluation of&#13;
project progress based on the monitoring indicators, compliance with legal covenants, and&#13;
procurement and financial management supervision. At the end of each mission, the&#13;
Government and the Bank will sign an Aide Memoir that will contain the major agreements&#13;
reached during the mission.&#13;
2.31  Mid-Term Review (MTR). Two years after the effectiveness date the Government and&#13;
the Bank will carry out a Mid-Term Review. Three months before this review the Government&#13;
and the Bank will agree upon the detailed terms of reference and staffing of the MTR team. In&#13;
particular, the MTR will evaluate: (i) the quality of surveys carried-out; (ii) use of data and&#13;
information by the private sector; (iii) institutional strengthening and financing by the&#13;
Government of MAG and INEC operating costs; and, (iv) procurement, disbursement and&#13;
financial aspects. The Mid-Term Review arrangements was agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
2.32  Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Within six months after project completion,&#13;
the Government and the Bank will carry out a joint project completion review and produce an&#13;
Implementation Report. A team composed of project staff, Bank-representatives and&#13;
independent specialists will carry out this review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
2.33   Measurable benefits/outputs would be in the form of improvements in rural data&#13;
consistency, validity, timeliness, and availability. This would encompass:&#13;
* Increase in data collection activities. The project will finance 11 data collection&#13;
activities for a total of 626 thousand questionnaires, including one Agricultural&#13;
Sample Census (ASC), four Planting Intention Surveys (PIS), three annual&#13;
Agricultural Farm Production Surveys (AFPS), one Farm Expenditure Survey&#13;
(FES), and three Ad Hoc Surveys.&#13;
*  Reduced elapsed time for processing and dissemination. For example, the 1974&#13;
Agricultural Census Results were first available three years after the data was&#13;
collected. For the Agricultural Sample Census, data processing and publication is&#13;
expected to take only eight months. For the AFPS, the time needed for processing&#13;
data will fall from 11 -.13 weeks to 8 weeks (see Attachment 8),&#13;
-  Increased quality, number, circulation of statistical abstracts, descriptive and&#13;
analytic reports, bulletins, and studies produced. Utilization of local languages,&#13;
user-friendly publications and data.&#13;
-  Implementation of a series of seminars and media broadcasts. The project will&#13;
support 8 national seminars to present the key findings of the surveys and 18&#13;
regional seminars to present the results of the sample census.&#13;

2.34   The benefits would come not only from the activities financed under the project, such&#13;
as the Agricultural Sample Census (ASC), but also from improvements in the quality of other&#13;
small-sample surveys, such as the LSMS, whose sampling frames are based on the ASC. (In&#13;
the recent past, the results from such small-sample surveys were questionable since the basic&#13;
sampling frame was based on dated information, and, consequently, the samples were&#13;
unrepresentative.)&#13;
2.35   The improvement in rural data consistency, validity, timeliness, and availability is&#13;
expected to cause a rnore sound decision-making process in both the public and private sector.&#13;
The project will improve the efficiency of both MAG and INEC. Both institutions will receive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
technical assistance and training in data collection, processing, analysis and dissemination.&#13;
Through improved access to quality information, better public policies can be designed leading&#13;
to improved rural productivity and hence to higher overall growth. Public sector decision&#13;
making and the formulation of sector policies would benefit from: (i) a clear description and&#13;
understanding of a problem situation; (ii) projections of alternative scenarios; and (iii) estimates&#13;
of responses of consumers and producers to interventions and changes in external parameters.&#13;
Furthermore, improved infornation would lead to better targeting of government's programs&#13;
thereby helping the rural poor and the indigenous people. Finally, in the event of a shift in the&#13;
terms of trade against agriculture, it will be possible to design and implement policies that can&#13;
impact positively on those most affected thereby reducing political pressure to introduce&#13;
protection (measured by nominal protection rates for major commodities) and hence undermine&#13;
reform efforts.&#13;
2.36   The provision of quality mformation and analysis would improve private sector&#13;
decision making as well. This is all the more important today as Ecuador moves away from the&#13;
certainty that used to accompany fixed prices established by the Government to prices that&#13;
reflect day-to-day market conditions. Farmers, traders, and agro-businesses should benefit&#13;
from the project through: (i) reduction in transactions costs by accessing to up-to-date and&#13;
relevant information on production, stocks, prices, and weather; and (ii) reduction in risk by&#13;
having the data for reliable cost and price projections. Furthermore, market efficiency would&#13;
be improved from (i) greater price stability (for example, from stock adjustments made in&#13;
response to future expectations); and (ii) reduction in asymmetrical information between rich,&#13;
well-informed traders and their poorer counterparts (who cannot invest in the search for data).&#13;
For example, in the past, rice traders operated with prices set by the state. Now, post-&#13;
liberalization of the sector, traders need to know both the domestic and international price and&#13;
supply situation, the exchange rate, tariffs, and the interest rate. If many people have this&#13;
information better sectoral investment and trading decisions will be made benefiting both&#13;
producers and consumers.&#13;
2.37   Quantitative economic analysis for the project is attempted only for the calculation of&#13;
benefits from higher sectoral growth, and not of benefits from improved targeting of&#13;
Government programs which would lead to poverty reduction. Given the difficulties in&#13;
measuring the benefits of policy reforms in advance, it is necessary to examnine the break-even&#13;
point to determine the minimum benefits required to justify expenditures under the project and&#13;
examine the probability that project activities would attain that level of benefits. In 1995, value&#13;
added in the Ecuadoran agricultural sector was around US$2.0 billion. Assumng a discount&#13;
rate of 10 percent, and a 1 0-year benefit horizon, an increase of just 0.25 percent in value&#13;
added in the sector would justify the project. It is expected that the contribution from measures&#13;
included in the sectoral reform would be much larger particularly because benefits would&#13;
accrue to non-agricultural activities as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
2.38   Beneficiaries. Project beneficiaries could be separated in two groups: the first group&#13;
encompasses those who will participate in project implementation, such as staff of MAG and&#13;
INEC, as well as the staff of contracted companies, who will benefit from the institutional&#13;
development, technical assistance, and training provided by the project. The second group&#13;
encompasses those decision-makers that will use project outputs such as data, information,&#13;
analysis, etc. They could be further divided in the following five sub-groups: (i) economic&#13;
analysts within the central Government, sector ministries, and public agencies, such as&#13;
decision-makers in the Ministry of Agriculture, the Fund for Social Emergency Investments&#13;
(FISE), or the Banco de Fomento; (ii) managers of projects and public enterprises, such as&#13;
managers of rural development projects, or the National Organization for Agricultural&#13;
Marketing (ENAC); (iii) researchers and analyst in universities and research institutions; (iv)&#13;
private sector institutions, private enterprises, and farmers, such as private banks, or producer&#13;
associations; and, (v) external multilateral and bilateral institutions, such as external donors,&#13;
development institutions, etc.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
2.39   Ecuador's increasing fiscal deficit could reduce financial support for project activities&#13;
leading to a reduction of capabilities in both MAG and INEC. Even if funding and capabilities&#13;
remain, the political environment may derail the reforms. The risk of reduced public funding is&#13;
addressed by a modular project design that will retain considerable flexibility in project&#13;
implementation, whereas, the risk of diminished political support is addressed with specific&#13;
design measures to improve information service to high-level public officials and private sector&#13;
interests. Moreover, it should be noted that the proposed project is largely built on a base of&#13;
activities that have been and are continuing to be carried out. This is particularly true in MAG,&#13;
where the project will expand, improve, and strengthen activities already being carried out by&#13;
the SSPI. In INEC, both the Agricultural Sample Census and the Rural Income and&#13;
Expenditure Survey will be new activities, although the institution has a long and effective&#13;
professional history of conducting surveys.&#13;
Environmental Category&#13;
2.40   The project's environmental category is B. The project will contribute to providing&#13;
information to environmental and social policy makers, promoting a sound policy process.&#13;
Among social policies, the Government of Ecuador is recently paying increasing attention to&#13;
indigenous people issues, and the Census should contribute significant information on issues&#13;
relevant to the rural indigenous people. To ensure this, the project will finance technical&#13;
assistance of experts in this field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ATTACHIENT I&#13;
ECUIADOR&#13;
AGRICULTURAL CENSUS AND INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Data Collection Activities&#13;
1.    A series of data collection activities are contemplated under the present project.&#13;
Each of these activities, while complementing the others in a variety of ways, is designed&#13;
for a distinct purpose and would collect different data. The purpose of this annex is to&#13;
clarify the differences as well as demonstrate the connections that exist among the&#13;
activities.&#13;
2.    Overview of Usual National Data Collection Structure. Most countries carry&#13;
out two main census activities: a Population Census and an Agricultural Census. The&#13;
purpose of any census, in general termns, is to measure specific characteristics of the total&#13;
population. In a Population Census, the population is all persons living in the country,&#13;
therefore the individual is the unit of observation. In an Agricultural Census, the&#13;
population is all farms or Agricultural Production Units (UPAs), and the farm or UTPA is&#13;
the unit of observation&#13;
3n.    Due to the extremely expensive and logistically complex nature of a census, such&#13;
exercises are usually carried out once a decade and the types of data collected are very&#13;
limited. Surveys are carried out in the interim period to satisfy the need for more frequent&#13;
and/or more in-depth data. Samples or subsets of the population are created based on the&#13;
sample frames of the census. Researchers then interview only those units of observation in&#13;
the sample and extrapolate the findings to the national level or total population. While&#13;
surveys suffer from greater sampling error, the small size and the ability to increase&#13;
supervision and training help to lower non-sampling error. Also, it is possible to collect&#13;
more in-depth data or cover more categories in a survey.&#13;
Project Data Collection Activities&#13;
4.    There are six separate data collection activities that would be carried out under the&#13;
project (see Table 9):&#13;
(a)   Agricultural Sample Census (ASC);&#13;
(b)   Agricultural Farm Production Survey (AFPS);&#13;
(c)   Planting Intention Survey (PIS);&#13;
(d)   Farm Expenditure Survey (FES); and&#13;
(e)   Ad hoc Surveys (AS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
5.    In addition, a sixth survey--the LSMS--is included in Table 9. This survey is&#13;
financed under a different World Bank project (3425-EC) and, as of 1995, will also be&#13;
implemented by INEC. The main relationships and differences among these surveys are&#13;
described below.&#13;
6.    Sample Unit: Given that the sample frames created for the Population Census&#13;
(carried out in 1991) and the Agricultural Sample Census (ASC, to be carried as part of&#13;
the proposed project) are different, the frame to be used for the individual surveys is a&#13;
function of the unit of observation and the type of data required. For all surveys where the&#13;
unit of observation is the UJPA, the ASC sample frame would be used. The data collection&#13;
activities under this project that would be included here are: the Agricultural Farm&#13;
Production Survey (AFPS), the Planting Intention Survey (PIS) and the Farm Expenditure&#13;
Survey (FES).&#13;
7.    Purpose and Types of Data Collected. The ASC would collect data on overall&#13;
agricultural land use and production. The geographic coverage of the ASC would allow&#13;
data to be disaggregated to the canton level (196 cantons in Ecuador). To provide data on&#13;
the agricultural production of each year, the AFPS would be carried out. This survey&#13;
would use a smaller sample of UPAs (see Table 9) and would provide data at the&#13;
provincial level (20 provinces in Ecuador).&#13;
8.    The PIS collects similar data to that in the AFPS with two important distinctions.&#13;
First, the survey is designed to provide data on which to make projections of agricultural&#13;
production. This is a key tool for agricultural planning and forms part of the MAG analysis&#13;
program. The other difference is that the PIS is geared solely to the large export crops of&#13;
the coastal region. Given the large size of the UPAs in this region and the predominance&#13;
of a few export crops it is possible, with a fairly small sample, to make reasonably accurate&#13;
projections of agricultural production in the region and, hence, potential exports.&#13;
9.    The FES, while also using the UPA as the unit of analysis, has very distinct aims.&#13;
Unlike the other surveys that address the characteristics of the agricultural sector and&#13;
overall production, the FES would gather data on how this production is achieved. The&#13;
data collected in this survey would provide information on prices, costs of different&#13;
technologies and the overall cost structures in the agricultural sector.&#13;
10.   The Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) is a different data collection&#13;
activity which has been carried out in 1994 and 1995 under another project (3425-EC).&#13;
The LSMS provides data on all facets of individual and household welfare and allows: (i)&#13;
the measurement of poverty; (ii) policy relevant data on the characteristics of the poor and&#13;
non-poor; and (iii) the analysis of the determinants of poverty and other social sector&#13;
outcomes. None of the other surveys would provide the amount of data on different&#13;
topics, nor the same social sector data and analysis capabilities.&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Implementing Institutions&#13;
1.    The project implementing institutions are the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Livestock (MAG) and the National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC). INEC&#13;
concentrated on data collection, processing, and dissemination, and MAG concentrated on&#13;
the analysis and dissemination of data and policies. This annex describes the two&#13;
institutions and their relationships.&#13;
TE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AN) LIVESTOCK (MAG)&#13;
2.    MAG is responsible for sector policies and advice on macroeconomic and&#13;
multisectoral policies that affect the agricultural sector. It is also responsible for providing&#13;
objective information to the private sector and other public sector agencies fitted to meet&#13;
of their decision making requirements. The recent restructuring of MAG (see Figure 3&#13;
page 3 3)provides an institutional focus for the analysis of agricultural policies and&#13;
information. Other MAG offices and other public agencies also compile, process, and&#13;
analyze information that can make a positive contribution to the informnation system.&#13;
3 .    The recently-created Office of the Under-Secretary for Sector Policy and&#13;
Investment (SPIS) replaced the Office of the Under-Secretary for Marketing. SPIS is&#13;
composed of four directorates: (i) Policy Analysis, (ii) Internal and External Trade,&#13;
(iii) Agricultural Information, and (iv) Planning, Investments and Budgeting The&#13;
Agricultural Sector Program of the Inter-American Development Bank works closely with&#13;
SPIS Objective of this program is the agricultural sector adjustment and includes a&#13;
component of institutional support for MAG. However, this component does not cover&#13;
the information system The main functions and responsibility of SPIS's directorates are&#13;
described below.&#13;
4.    Directorate General Of Policy Analysis. This directorate is responsible for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating sector performance, identifying sector problems, conducting&#13;
economic analysis of policy problems, evaluating policy altematives for decisionmakers,&#13;
and informing the private sector about the situation and prospects for the main staple&#13;
crops. It publishes a monthly report on the "Situation and Outlook for Staple Crops",&#13;
which is widely distributed in the public and private sectors. It is distributed to MAG staff&#13;
for use in their analysis reports (policy memoranda), which deal with a wide variety of&#13;
policy problems ranging from the impact of the European Economic Community&#13;
restrictions on bananas, to the impact of rnilk imports on domestic prices and production.&#13;
The Directorate of Policy Analysis also compiles, organizes, and analyzes macroeconomic&#13;
and trade data, using secondary sources. The reports on the "Situation and Outlook for&#13;
Staple Crops" are more directly oriented to monitoring the dynamic variables (prices,&#13;
trade, production, etc.)&#13;

5.       Internal And External Trade Directorate. This directorate is responsible&#13;
internally for grain marketing policies related to the National Marketing Corporation, and&#13;
externally for the price range policy, tariffs, and problems related to entry into GATT,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
NAFTA, and the Andean Free Trade Zone. In the near future, external trade problems&#13;
would dominate the work of this directorate, which also provides continuous monitoring&#13;
of international prices and market conditions through a computerized international&#13;
network.&#13;
6.    Agricultural Information Directorate. This directorate is divided in the&#13;
following four divisions:&#13;
(a)   Agricultural Statistics Division. This division conducts small surveys,&#13;
based on a sub-sample of the national agricultural frame managed by&#13;
INEC. It conducts two types of surveys: (i) the Agricultural Farm&#13;
Production Survey (AFPS), and the Planting Intention Survey. It also&#13;
conducts one or two targeted surveys a year, such as the survey to&#13;
determine livestock parameters. AFPS is highly important for decision&#13;
making. Other activities performed by this directorate include: estimates of&#13;
livestock slaughtered, estimates of balanced feed, and compilation of&#13;
secondary data from the Central Bank. The division has learned how to&#13;
design and conduct surveys, but still suffers from some shortcomings in&#13;
statistical methods, use of descriptive statistics, and sampling.&#13;
(b)   Market Prices and News Service. The main responsibility of this division&#13;
is the operation of an information system on wholesale market prices for&#13;
staple farm crops and dissemination of the results. It systematically&#13;
compiles, processes, and disseminates wholesale prices from the country's&#13;
20 largest markets, including border markets with Peru and Colombia.&#13;
This system alerts analysts to changes in prices on the main wholesale and&#13;
border markets. Price reports are produced daily, weekly, and monthly.&#13;
With the reorganization, this area would also be responsible for providing&#13;
price information on the farm level (or the first purchaser). The operation&#13;
is based on a chain of computerized telex machines, supplemented with fax&#13;
communications with the markets. Inadequate supervision and training for&#13;
personnel in the field has been causing problems in controlling the quality&#13;
of the data.&#13;
(c)   Agroclimatic Impact Evaluation Unit. Ecuador's farming area suffers&#13;
serious climatic risks, ranging from low precipitation in the sierra to flood&#13;
in the coastal region. The climate is an important factor in making&#13;
decisions on planting, crop development, yield, and production. This unit&#13;
monitors rainfall and other weather variables, through 50 stations, to enable&#13;
it to evaluate the possible impact of climate factors on planting, crop&#13;
maturity, and projected yield. This information is used by policy makers to&#13;
decide when a climate phenomena has to be considered a natural disaster.&#13;
These activities are carried out in cooperation with the National&#13;
Meteorology and Hydrology Institute (INAMHI).&#13;
(d)   Computer Center. The computer center is organized as a service center&#13;
for PC users in MAG. It processes surveys, carries out basic repairs and&#13;
maintenance, provides training in software applications and technical&#13;
assistance for users, and develops user-ready systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
7.    The Directorate General Of Planning, Investment, and Budgeting. This&#13;
directorate is responsible for preparing the annual budget for the entire sector and fnr&#13;
monitoring and evaluating sector programs and projects. The current budgeting process is&#13;
apparently a mere exercise in adjusting the past budget to an inflation factor, within the&#13;
widespread budgetary constraints. Investment planning is not linked to budget priorities.&#13;
Monitoring is based on inputs, and solid evaluations have been scarce There is very little&#13;
real analysis of cost effectiveness, distribution, or the impact of public spending and&#13;
investments in the sector.&#13;
8.    One major problem that has become apparent in MAG is its lack of capacity to&#13;
monitor its main programs and investments. This can be put down to the absence of a&#13;
formal budgeting system that includes the establishment of objectives, priorities,&#13;
programming, and budget execution and monitoring. It is also necessary to institute&#13;
organized and structured planning of activities with the formal participation and support of&#13;
all areas in MAG. In this process MAG's budget should be framed in the context of the&#13;
objectives and goals of a program tailored to its institutional realities and limitations,&#13;
which should form part of a long-term strategy. Another crucial area where support is&#13;
needed in MAG is for more effective monitoring of agricultural programs and projects, to&#13;
determine whether the Ministry's different programs and investments are achieving the&#13;
expected impact Other countries have made similar efforts and their applicability to&#13;
MAG should be evaluated.&#13;
NATIONAL STATISTIC AND CENSUS LINSTITUTJE (INEC)&#13;
9.    The National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) is the other main institution&#13;
that would participate in the compilation, processing, analysis, and dissemination of&#13;
agricultural information under the proposed project INEC has also been reorganized to&#13;
gear its structure to policies for modernization of the State and decentralize it&#13;
administratively to enable it to carry out its responsibilities in a more efficient and timely&#13;
manner&#13;

10    INEC's mandate is to direct the national statistics system (NSS), and to produce&#13;
and disseminate, with high quality standards, national statistical information that can be&#13;
used to gain an adequate understanding of the economic and social situation Its main&#13;
activities that are relevant for the agricultural sector stem from the studies and surxeys it&#13;
conducts They include periodic surveys of manufacturers, industries and the service&#13;
sector, the national population and housing census (1990), the monthly survey of the&#13;
consumer price index, the Agricultural Farm Production Survey (part of the National&#13;
Agricultural Statistics System) performed at the end of the year using a relatively large&#13;
area sample INEC is currently making a significant effort to provide data, information,&#13;
and analysis of the problem of poverty in the country, the distribution of public&#13;
investment, regional standards of living, and a survey to identify and locate the very poor.&#13;
11    INEC has made important headway, including a complex series of survey and&#13;
census operations that produce crucial information for the agricultural sector This&#13;
progress has been made through intensive work and complex national logistical systems&#13;
for data collection However, the strategy has led to very long elapsed time between data&#13;
collection, processing, tabulation, publication, and distribution. Moreover, the work has&#13;
been done despite the typical problems afflicting the public sector which include the need&#13;
for better quality, reliability, and timeliness, the lack of adequate experience and technical&#13;
know-how on the part of the agents responsible for collecting and processing data,&#13;
analysis methodologies, and commitment by individuals to the information for which they&#13;
are responsible, including such things as quality control, descriptive analysis,&#13;
understanding of user requirements, etc Improvement in these areas would require&#13;
further training and technical assistance  NTEC also suffers from traditional public-sector&#13;
problems with regard to shortages of resources and logistical support, and inadequate&#13;
salaries and incentives for technical personnel in the field and at the provincial and central&#13;
levels&#13;
12    In the past, period of one or two years in rNEC's processing of surveys were&#13;
traditional and even acceptable. With the revolution in data-processing technologies, user&#13;
expectations have become more demanding and less tolerant of delays in both the&#13;
processing and publication of results Although INEC has improved its elapsed time, it&#13;
has been very difficult for it to step up its already intensive processing activities The state&#13;
of the art in information processing has undergone revolutionary changes in the last few&#13;
years INEC's information technologies have rapidly become obsolete, as for example its&#13;
dependence on a UNISYS system which operates with COBOL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
13.   INEC is organized in the following five directorates (see Figure page 38):&#13;
(i) Statistical Development And Planning, (ii) Economic Statistics, (iii) Socio-demographic&#13;
Statistics, (iv) Computer Systems, and (v) Statistics Distribution.&#13;

inventory of strategic natural resources), and the Industrial Statistics Department&#13;
(processing and services sectors, informal sector)&#13;
16    Socio-demographic Statistics Directorate This directorate is responsible for&#13;
demographic and social aspects in Ecuador, and it obtains its data through censuses,&#13;
surveys, and administrative records It has three departments the Household Statistics&#13;
Department (household surveys), the Social Statistics Department (studies on the nature&#13;
of communit- assistance), and the Population Statistics Department (population, housing,&#13;
and habitat in general)&#13;
17    Computer Systems Directorate. It is responsible for the development, regulation,&#13;
and productive use of computerized information on the institutional level, under the&#13;
framework of computerized information policies. It includes the following departments:&#13;
Systems Development Department (creation and maintenance of computer systems),&#13;
Operations and Production Department (productive use of computerized information&#13;
through good service to the users of computer systems and equipment, completeness of&#13;
data and information files), and the Expansion and Maintenance Section (maintenance of&#13;
equipment and planned growth of computer equipment and communications)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

18.   Statistics Distribution Directorate. This directorate is responsible for creating a&#13;
statistical culture in the country, formulating dissemination policies, and maintaining the&#13;
institutional image through communication of the results of the different investigations and&#13;
studies. It has a Promotions, Communications, and Protocol Department (applies&#13;
dissemination policies through magnetic, optical, and mechanical media, and programs&#13;
actions for the communication and promotion of national statistical activities), and a&#13;
Technical Services Department (provides institutions, national and international agencies,&#13;
and general users with information and data using magnetic, optical, and mechanical&#13;
means, either free of charge or at cost).&#13;
19.   Other agencies also play a role in generating and processing information of&#13;
relevance for sector policies. They must be taken into account (although not for financing&#13;
under this project). They include institutions reporting to MAG, other public sector&#13;
agencies (Central Bank, Ministry of Social Welfare, etc.), certain intemational projects,&#13;
and different private sector entities. Efforts would be made to include them all in the&#13;
process of disseminating agricultural information. As a minimum, the efforts by these&#13;
agencies to generate, process, and analyze agricultural information should be coordinated&#13;
to reduce the likelihood of redundancy and improve the compatibility and consistency of&#13;
their information.&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Data User Requirements Study&#13;
1.    A Data User Requirements Study (DIURS) was undertaken in Ecuador during&#13;
February, 1993. Purpose of this study was to identify data needs of users, such as&#13;
decisionmakers, policy analysts, producers associations, etc., in both public and private&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
2.    The study was conducted through a double phased unstructured interview to 74&#13;
data users from 19 public and private institutions. The results of the fist phase of&#13;
interviews was reviewed by the same interviewees to: (i) allow to double check their&#13;
responses and consider the questions more thoroughly; and (ii) review responses of other&#13;
data users.&#13;
3 .    One objective of the DURS was to train MAG and INEC personnel to continue&#13;
the interviewing process. These institutions are prepared to conduct additional interviews&#13;
as required. Future interviews should also contact again initial interviewees in order to&#13;
confirm data requirements which have been revealed in this study. The users' answers&#13;
have been counted treating each response equally. Further analysis should weigh&#13;
responses according to the importance of the data user.&#13;
The interviewed sample&#13;
4.    A total of 74 persons were interviewed. They were staff of the following 19&#13;
institutions: (i) Public Sector. Thirty-two high level staff of fifteen different institutions in&#13;
MAG, four persons in The Ministry of Social Welfare, two persons in the Instituto&#13;
Nacional de Empleo (INEM), three persons in CONADE, and four persons in the Banco&#13;
Nacional de Fomento. Three persons from INEC and the Statistics Division of MAG&#13;
reported for institutions that wish to generate data; (ii) Private Sector. Sixteen people&#13;
from the Camara de Agricultura de la Primera Zona, the Association of Livestock in the&#13;
Sierra and the Oriente, and Banco del Pacifico. Five staff of Fundaci6n IDEA reported&#13;
for private institutions that analyze data generated by themselves or by others;&#13;
(iii) Projects/Programs. Five staff from the Rural Development Project (PRONADER),&#13;
CEDEGE, and PROTECA. Two persons from the project of Rural Household Surveys&#13;
(USAID) reported for institutions that wish to generate data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
Results&#13;
5.    The result of the study shows that there is a multitude of data requirements in&#13;
Ecuador. The diversity is impressive given the variability of the agricultural activities that&#13;
are of concern: they range from rural poverty alleviation to environmental protection, from&#13;
investment selections to marketing decisions. The DUJRS pointed out that raw data is not&#13;
as helpful for the majority of the users, who require an analysis providing alternative&#13;
decisions and possible impacts of their choices.&#13;
6.    Twenty-one different items were identified as data requirements. Some contained&#13;
multiple elements. For example, "livestock requirement" contains: (i) type of livestock,&#13;
(ii) time between births; (iii) culling rates; (iv) death rates; (v) age at weaning,&#13;
(vi) weight at weaning; (vii) age sold; (viii) weight sold; (ix) diseases; and (x) vaccines.&#13;
Other items were simply identified. For example, "land tenure" was the first item identified&#13;
by the Sub-secretary of Technology/MAG to be of critical importance.&#13;
7.    The summary of interviews result is as follows (see Table 1):&#13;
(a)    Farm Production Expenses was identified most frequently. 68.4 % gave&#13;
high priority reflecting the need for cost of production analyses;&#13;
(b)   Rural Income was identified by 52.6 % as high priority. Rural income is&#13;
difficult to obtain from farmers who feel this is private information.&#13;
Therefore, data are obtained on related items, and an extensive analysis is&#13;
required;&#13;
(c)   Land Tenure was identified by 47.4 % as high priority.&#13;
(d)   Crop Yields/Production was identified by 42.1 % as high priority. Much of&#13;
this requirement is being satisfied by current data.&#13;
(e)    Rural Ernployment was identified by 42.1 % as high priority. Employment&#13;
is a critical element in the analysis of determining rural income.&#13;
(f)    Farm Management was identified by 36.8 % as high priority. Many projects&#13;
have farm management as a key component.&#13;
(g)   Crop Hectares was identified as high priority by 31.6 %. Crop hectares&#13;
like yields are provided by both SEAN and the Division of Statistics/ MAG&#13;
sub-sample surveys.&#13;
(h)    Small Grains were identified as high priority by 31.6 %. Presently, 95 % of&#13;
the small grain used in Ecuador is imported. This may increase to 100 %.&#13;
Social and economic information on the native small grain producers was&#13;
one highlighted area of interest.&#13;
(i)    Mechanization was identified as high priority by 31.6 %. Mechanization is&#13;
a means to increase production in projects and programs.&#13;
(j)    Soils/Conservation was identified as high priority by 26.3 %. Soils&#13;
conservation is paramount to the future of sustainable agriculture in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
Ecuador. The interviewees of this DURS were interested primarily in&#13;
commercial agriculture.&#13;
(k)    Social Data were identified as high priority by 26.3 %. Social issues are&#13;
important to projects and programs which educate to change behavior.&#13;
(1)    Credit was identified as high priority by 26.3 %, as it is thought to be&#13;
critical to increase productivity of the land.&#13;

Note: the total sample comprises 19 public and private institutions&#13;
8.     The level of data disaggregation was another important question: are national,&#13;
provincial, cantons or parochial level data required? The consequences of this are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
fundamental for the design of data collection activities. On one hand, MAG and other&#13;
public institutions do not require data below the provincial level. On the other hand, the&#13;
private sector, projects and programs required a lower level of data disaggregation, such&#13;
as the canton and parochial levels. CONADE also indicates the need for accurate data at&#13;
these levels.&#13;
9.    From the 19 institutions, projects, and programs there were 113 different&#13;
infornation needs mentioned. Of these 113 information requirements, there were four&#13;
that did not require an analysis of the raw data. The remaining 109 data requirements&#13;
need some type of analysis in order for the decision makers to interpret data for&#13;
applications in decision-making.&#13;

            Ecuador - Agricultural Census and
            Information System Technical Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Agricultural Census and Information
            System Technical Assistance Project for Ecuador aims to
            improve availability, consistency, validity, and timeliness
            of agricultural information to facilitate the
            decision-making process in both the public and private
            sectors. The project has five components. The Agricultural
            Policy component 1) strengthens sector policy analysis
            capacity; and 2) strengthens the budget analysis and
            investment monitoring and evaluation process at the Ministry
            of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). The Agricultural
            Information and Dissemination Service component improves 1)
            information services on crops and livestock; 2) market
            prices and news services of MAG; 3) agroclimatic impact
            evaluations; and 4) MAG Computer Center services.  The
            Agricultural Sample Census component supports designing,
            preparing, and executing the national Agricultural Sample
            Census; and strengthens the data processing capacity of the
            National Statistics and Census Institute.  The Agricultural
            Farm Production Survey component improves the national
            agricultural production survey methodology, speeds
            processing turn-around, conducts two production surveys per
            year, and executes one farm expenditure survey during the
            life of the project. The fifth component is project management.
