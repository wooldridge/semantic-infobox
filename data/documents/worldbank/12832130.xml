Specific studies. In response to emerging questions from                              are several communications agencies in Senegal, the early&#13;
the performance monitoring process, the project team initiated                        stages of the procurement process (carried out in accordance&#13;
specific studies. In early 2010, a survey of approximately 400                        with World Bank regulations) attracted mostly consulting firms&#13;
households was conducted to determine the level of satisfaction                       from the water and sanitation sector with little experience in&#13;
with existing handwashing stations. Research findings indicated                       creative design and media production. Lacking this expertise,&#13;
the need to conduct spot research among community relays.                             the lead consulting firm sub-contracted for media production&#13;
A follow-up learning event to share findings with implementing                        and considerable negotiations were needed to maximize the&#13;
agencies is also planned.                                                             production budget allocated to the sub-contracted firm.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to monitoring activities or outputs, the project team                     Changing the mind-set of advertising agencies. The initial&#13;
will monitor outcomes as follows:                                                     concepts received from the firm selected used a negative&#13;

"Doer/non-doer" studies. A second "doer/non-doer" study                               for a positive message. Changing the mind-set of advertising&#13;
will assess if determinants targeted through the intervention are                     agencies designing behavior change communications in&#13;
moving in the "right" direction, particularly access and availability                 general--and hygiene promotion communications in particular--&#13;
to soap and water. Positive changes in targeted determinants                          requires considerable hand-holding. Monthly meetings with the&#13;
are assumed to mean that behavior change will follow.                                 agency were held to ensure they were part of the journey.&#13;

surveys are planned. Though the main purpose of these surveys                         time a handwashing study segmented those who practice&#13;

Transforming community relays into community                       Having a tangible product supports behavior change&#13;

tap into a robust network of community relays that operates        sample handwashing station to distribute to women makes the&#13;

traditionally used to convey information. The second phase         planning process to ensure handwashing with soap occurs&#13;
of the project requires outreach workers to facilitate mothers'    in the household. Discussion with mothers can then focus on&#13;
problem-solving abilities and to fortify their intentions to       where to place the handwashing station and how to ensure&#13;
handwash with soap. Performance monitoring, particularly           that the station is always stocked with soap and water. As&#13;
just-in-time coaching, has proved critical to transforming         mentioned above, a handwashing station provides a stable&#13;
relays into community resources. To reflect their enhanced         context in which the behavior can take place and provides&#13;
role, community relays are now referred to within the project      environmental cues. The project team will investigate the&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 2003, the Public-Private Partnership
            for Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW) was created in Senegal
            with technical assistance from the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP). Housed initially within the Office Nationale
            de L'Assainissement, the government unit overseeing
            sanitation within the Ministry of Health, the PPPHW's
            main objective was to catalyze and coordinate multi-sectoral
            involvement in the promotion of handwashing with soap. This
            learning note serves to document the behavior change
            component of the project in Senegal, including key
            strategies, results, challenges, and lessons learned.
