VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Mali has requested IDA assistance in financing a project to improve the&#13;
quality, supply and relevance of its vocational education and training (VET) services, in order to increase&#13;
the responsiveness of such services to labor market demand for skilled workers. This increased coherence&#13;
between training and emplovment is a key factor for achieving Mali's overall development objectives of&#13;
growth and poverty reduction, and is an essential aspect of human resources development, a cornerstone of&#13;
IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali.&#13;
1.2   The project would improve the quality, supply and relevance of VET services through&#13;
consolidation of pre-service VET training streams, and creation of a Vocational Training Support Fund for&#13;
in-service skills upgrading. In addition, the project would improve labor market information analysis and&#13;
dissemination through the establishment of an Employment and Training Observatory at the National&#13;
Manpower and Employment Office.&#13;
1.3   Project investments would include hardware and software investments in both pre-service and in-&#13;
service VET to improve training capacity and quality. This would include civil works, equipment,&#13;
pedagogical materials, training of trainers, teacher upgrading, curriculum and examination reforms, and&#13;
institutional capacity-building. A revision of all legal texts pertaining to VET would be completed before&#13;
project effectiveness, in order to improve Government's capacity to allocate training resources as a function&#13;
of labor market demand, and to increase the involvement of the private sector in the management, provision&#13;
and financing of VET. The total project would cost US$ 22.9 million (including taxes and duties), with a&#13;
foreign exchange component of US$ 14.8 million. Of this, Government and employers would contribute&#13;
US$ 5.8 rmillion, IDA wvould finance US$ 13.4 million, and the Fonds dAide et de Cooperation (FAC)&#13;
would provide US$ 3.7 million.&#13;
1.4   This project was prepared in-country, with the task manager located in the Resident Mission. This&#13;
enabled extensive beneficiary participation, near exclusive use of national consultants for preparatory&#13;
studies, and close collaboration with Government officials and other donors. In addition to a three-person&#13;
Government preparation team, a "consultative group" for the project was established, including the&#13;
National Federation of Malian Employers, the National Federation of Malian Artisans, NGOs, women's&#13;
associations, private training centers, and recent school graduates. Weekly meetings with the task manager&#13;
during preparation resulted in firm ownership and commitment to the project among the Borrower and&#13;
intended project beneficiaries. In particular, the Operations Manual for the proposed Vocational Training&#13;
Support Fund was drafted, revised and finalized in concert with the consultative group. A Japanese PHRD&#13;
Grant for US$300,000 and a Project Preparation Facility for US$ 350,000 financed the necessary&#13;
consultants and other project preparation activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
A.  MACROECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT&#13;
Macroeconomy&#13;
1.5    Mali is a vast, landlocked and resource-poor country located in the Sahelian zone of westem&#13;
Africa. About 75 percent of the population, estimated at about 9 million in 1995, is engaged in the&#13;
agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 50 percent of GDP. Per capita income is estimated at&#13;
just US$250 (1994) and social indicators (such as life expectancy, literacy and infant mortality) are among&#13;
the lowest in the world (Mali ranked 167 out of 173 countries in the UNDP rating of human resources&#13;
development in 1994).&#13;
1.6    Mali's potential for long-term growth is subject to harsh resource constraints. Growth in the&#13;
agricultural sector is largely conditioned bv variable rainfall, fragile soils and low-productivity traditional&#13;
technologies. Secondly, extremely low literacy and schooling rates, and scarce technical skills, pose&#13;
additional obstacles to agricultural and industrial development. These problems are compounded bv high&#13;
population growth (2.7%), which puts severe pressure on both the limited natural resource base and the&#13;
resources available for basic public services (such as education) and other productive investments, in tum&#13;
restricting employment opportunities.&#13;
1.7    On the bright side, real GDP grew an average of 3.1% annuallv between 1992-1994 (following&#13;
stagnant GDP growth between 1980 and 1991), and the devaluation of the West African Franc (CFAF) in&#13;
early 1994 offers the country the possibility to exploit its comparative advantages in agriculture, agro-&#13;
processing, and production of low-technology import substitutes, thereby increasing incomes for both rural&#13;
and urban populations. Furthermore. recent macroeconomic management has been largely positive, with&#13;
all macroeconomic objectives achieved in 1994 and 1995. Inflation has been contained, exports have&#13;
increased significantly, and fiscal and current account deficits in 1994 were lower than projected. Private&#13;
capital reflows have picked up and private consumption is shifting to local products. The three-year public&#13;
investment program for 1995-1997 is being satisfactorily implemented, and real GDP is expected to grow&#13;
at an average annual rate of 5.0% between 1995 and 1997. The overall picture which emerges is one of&#13;
opportunity, which must be supported by investments to generate the needed supply response, particularly&#13;
in the area of human resources.&#13;
Labor Force and Employment&#13;
1.8    Supply. Mali has one of the least-skilled labor forces in the world. The vast majoritv of the active&#13;
labor force has had no schooling whatsoever, the adult literacy rate is estimated at 20%, and the mean&#13;
years of schooling for adults aged 25 years or more is just 0.3 years. The gross primary enrollment rate is&#13;
35% (1995), and only 25% for girls. (For more complete statistics on school enrollments, see Annex 4.1).&#13;
Development of primarv education is therefore the first priority for improving the quality of Mali's labor&#13;
force (which will be supported with IDA financing through a recently-identified Education Sector&#13;
Investment Program). Beyond primarv education, the labor force needs basic professional and technical&#13;
skills - literacy and numeracy alone are not enough.&#13;
1.9    The active labor force is estimated at 3.6 million workers (45% of the population is under 15). The&#13;
agriculture sector absorbs the greatest proportion of labor (about 75%), but this sector is characterized by&#13;
significant underemployment, often leading to urban migration. Manufacturing, construction and artisanal&#13;
occupations represent about 10% of the labor force, with the services sector accounting for another 15%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.10   The modem sector is estimated at 14.000 private sector workers, 11,000 parastatal employees and&#13;
37,000 civil servants. The Government's reform program has resulted in a near-freeze on hiring in the&#13;
public sector, voluntary civil servant departures and public enterprise lay-offs. Under the most optimistic&#13;
assumptions, growth over the short-term of formal private and public sector employment (currently around&#13;
1,300 jobs per year) will be unable to absorb the stock of already unemployed and the annual inflow of&#13;
80,000 newcomers into the labor market. Due to the momentum of population growth, this annual inflow&#13;
into the labor market will rise to 110,000 by 2005 and 140,000 by 2015.&#13;
1.11   The informal sector of the economy is, and will remain for the near future, the primary source of&#13;
non-agricultural employment. Of the non-agricultural labor force, approximately 90% (or 700,000&#13;
workers) are in the informal sector. With limited capital, the informal sector relies on high-intensity, low-&#13;
skill, low-cost labor, which obevs a mix of competitive market laws and tradition. Hiring, pay and&#13;
dismissals are flexible and determined bv market considerations (supply and demand for specific skills as&#13;
derived from goods markets), and familv/ethnic relations.&#13;
1.12   Between 1976 and 1988 registered. open unemployment doubled, and since then has remained at&#13;
the current level of around 20%. Youth unemployment (ages 15-29) makes up about two-thirds of open&#13;
unemployment, and 85% of registered jobseekers are young. The primary causes of this unemployment are&#13;
slow economic growth and general job scarcity. worsened by training programs which are poorly adapted&#13;
to labor market demand. Migration remains a popular response - approximately I million Malians work&#13;
abroad, although job opportunities in destination countries have declined.&#13;
1.13   Demand.       A series of 7 labor market and training surveys were conducted during project&#13;
preparation to ascertain labor market demand (in both formal and informal sectors, in Bamako and in the&#13;
regions), and to identifv vocational training streams most likely to lead to employment. A synthesis of these&#13;
studies indicates important labor market growth opportunities in certain sectors after the CFAF&#13;
devaluation, increasing demand for skilled manpower, and heightened employer concern over the quality of&#13;
trained staff available. (These studies included: a tracer study of recent VET graduates, a studv of private&#13;
sector training needs in Bamako, an analysis of the apprenticeship/production system in the informal sector,&#13;
A survey of economic growth and employment trends in the regions. an analysis of data from the Annual&#13;
Manpower Survey for the years 1988-1993; a reverse tracer study of recent VET graduates; and a study of&#13;
women's constraints to training and their training needs. For more information see Annex 2.2).&#13;
1.14   More specifically, significant growsth in production and employment are expected over the medium&#13;
term in the following areas: basic industries (principally textiles, agro-industrv and simple import&#13;
substitution), construction, public works, transport, hotels and tourism, crafts, and small and medium&#13;
enterprises. (Note that similar conclusions regarding promising economic sub-sectors were reached in the&#13;
World Bank's 1994 Private Sector Assessment for Mali.) This will require technically qualified specialists&#13;
in maintenance, mechanics (general, auto and truck). metalwork, electricity, construction and accounting.&#13;
Mid-level skilled workers will be most in demand (i.e. people willing and able to perform skilled tasks&#13;
themselves and, if necessary, to supervise others). Geographic centers for employment growth include&#13;
Bamako and the regional capitals of Sikasso, Segou and Kayes. These regional capitals correspond,&#13;
respectively, to the cotton, rice and mining production areas, which are developing rapidly following the&#13;
1994 CFAF devaluation. Currently, mid-level technical skills are often imported to meet this demand from&#13;
Senegal, Togo, Ivorv Coast, even the Philippines (for example, for construction of the Selingue Dam and&#13;
the West African Central Bank, routine mechanical repair jobs in industry, and development of the mining&#13;
sector).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.15   Labor Market Policy. As part of the World Bank-financed Structural Adjustment Program, the&#13;
Mali Labor Code was substantially revised in 1992, liberalizing important aspects of the code pertaining to&#13;
employee hiring and dismissal, the role of the National Manpower and Employment Office, and leave&#13;
policies (see Annex 5. 1). However, the legal texts required to apply the revised Labor Code were never&#13;
approved by the Government, due to opposition from national unions. As part of the 1995-1997 Policy&#13;
Framnework Paper signed with the Bretton Woods Institutions, the Government has agreed to review the&#13;
implementation of the revised code with the aim of identifying further areas of reform to allow more&#13;
flexibility in the functioning of the labor market. Following this, the legal framework of the revised Labor&#13;
Code will be strengthened to ensure full application.&#13;
B.    THE BANK'S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.16   The goal of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Mali is the alleviation of poverty through a&#13;
3-pronged approach: (i) sustained broad-based economic growth, (ii) human resources development, and&#13;
(iii) a special focus on the needs of the most vulnerable. Sound macroeconomic management and local&#13;
institutional capacity-building are essential to achieving these goals. In operational terms, this strategy&#13;
requires lending in education, training, health, agriculture, infrastructure, and urban job creation. The&#13;
proposed VET project responds to all three aspects of the Bank's strategy - by developing skills which&#13;
correspond to new employment opportunities, particularly among individuals in the informal sector and/or&#13;
outside of the formal education system, the Bank would contribute to economic growth, human resources&#13;
development and target the needs of relatively disadvantaged groups in urban areas.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
A.    VET SERVICES&#13;
Pre-Service VET&#13;
2.1    Structure and Administration. Mali currently offers three pre-service VET programs to prepare&#13;
youth for entry into the labor market, all at the upper secondary level (10th grade): (a) 2-year VET offering&#13;
the Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnel (CAP) in 13 specialties; (b) 3-year technical training leading to the&#13;
Baccalaureat Technique (BTN) in three specialties; and (c) four-year VET training for the Brevet&#13;
Technicien (BT) in 20 specialties. In 1995 the CAP was offered to 7,680 students, 30% of whom attend&#13;
the Vocational Training School (CFP) in Bamako, with the rest enrolled in 5 small regional vocational&#13;
training institutes (IFPs) and 13 private schools (which receive public subsidies on a per student basis).&#13;
The BTN was provided to 1,430 students at the Lycee Technique, while the BT was offered to 3,000&#13;
students at ECICA (Ecole d'Industrie, Commerce et Administration), plus another 1,300 students spread&#13;
out in the IFPs and 9 private training centers. Overall, the VET system enrolled 16,950 students in 1995,&#13;
while output has averaged 2,300 graduates per year. Public pre-service VET services are administered by&#13;
the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training (DNETP) within the Ministry of&#13;
Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research, while private schools are independently&#13;
managed.&#13;

\1: This is publicly-financed, privately-managed VET The State pays between 60,000-90,000 FCFA per student per year to the&#13;
school. With few exceptions, only tertiary sector training is offered.&#13;
2.2    Five other ministries operate their own training institutes, including the Ministry of Rural&#13;
Development (which runs a Forestry Training Center, the School for Veterinary Nursing, Agricultural&#13;
Apprenticeship and Skills Upgrading Centers), the Ministrv of Health (School for Communitv&#13;
Development Training, School of Pre-School Education, and three Nursing Schools), the Ministry of Youth&#13;
and Sports (National Sports Institute) and the Ministry of Conimunication and Culture (National Institute&#13;
of Art). These training institutes are not considered under this project, because of the focus on training for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
the private sector, particularly in industrial skills and the informal sector, as opposed to training for&#13;
government emplovees.&#13;
2.3    Formal pre-service apprenticeship training as part of VET does not exist in Mali, although an&#13;
embryonic apprenticeship progran for recent graduates is developing. Under this program the employer&#13;
agrees to hire the apprentice for a period of six months at 50% of normal wages, in return for which the&#13;
employer can deduct from taxable income what is paid in wages. However, early results from this program&#13;
are not encouraging, as few employers find the fiscal incentives sufficient and prefer to arrange informal&#13;
apprenticeship training without government intervention.&#13;
2.4    Financing of pre-service VET. In 1995 Government recurrent expenditures on pre-service VET&#13;
were estimated at 10% of total education expenditures, an increase from an average of 7% of total&#13;
education expenditures between 1987-1992 (compared to 14% for general secondarv). 47% of public VET&#13;
financing went to private VET providers in 1995, based on per student subsidies for teaching personnel and&#13;
educational materials. Annual per student costs for pre-service VET were an estimated US$325 in 1994,&#13;
varying by stream from US$170 for administration/finance to US$220 for accounting, US$450 for auto&#13;
mechanics. and US$600 for civil works. Cost recovery is not practiced. About 50% of VET expenditures&#13;
goes to personnel, 35% for equipment, materials, and maintenance. and 15% for student scholarships.&#13;
There has been no significant investment financing since the 1970s. except for minor foreign assistance in&#13;
auto mechanics, air conditioning and electricity in the mid-1980s.&#13;
In-Service VET&#13;
Apprenticeship Training&#13;
2.5    Traditional apprenticeship training has a long historv in Mali, and consists of learning practical&#13;
skills from a master artisan in more than 70 professional trades in the informal sector, including&#13;
construction, metalwork, auto mechanics, woodworking, dressmaking, soapmaking, food preparation,&#13;
jeatherwork, hairdressing and artwork. It has both economic and social rationales: the apprentice provides&#13;
cheap labor in exchange for learning practical skills, and in the process acquires traditional values of&#13;
solidanrty and respect for one's elders, which are essential to Mali's social fabric. An estimated 45,000&#13;
apprentices work and train in Bamako alone, and outside the capital this is the only form of non-tertiary&#13;
vocational training available. Apprenticeship training is thus more important than formal pre-service&#13;
VET, in terms of numbers of trainees and preparation of youth for immediate entry into the labor&#13;
market.&#13;
2.6    Training is a bv-product of production, not an activity undertaken for its own sake in preparation&#13;
for a job. Typicallv. one craftsman employs 4-5 apprentices, who varv in seniority and sophistication of&#13;
tasks assigned. Apprentices may spend the first year simply cleaning the workshop, observing others and&#13;
preparing tea. Practical tasks are assigned once the apprentice has demonstrated obedience and respect.&#13;
Depending on the trade, training lasts from I -10 years, although the average is 3-5 years. The long&#13;
apprenticeship period, the market requirement that the work performed be worthy of sale, and the emphasis&#13;
on practical skills means that trainees are often more skilled in their trade than their counterparts who&#13;
attended formal pre-service VET.&#13;
2.7    Apprenticeship training is not structured nor effectively regulated. In most cases, masters pay&#13;
apprentices a subsistence wage (US$1- 1.25 per day), although sometimes parents pay a token amount to&#13;
the master, or the exchange of labor for training is simply bartered. But changes in economic and social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
realities are changing apprenticeship training, as well. The demand for training is increasing (due to&#13;
demographic growth, rural to urban migration, and the stagnation of the education svstem and civil&#13;
service), the number of trades is increasing with modernization, and the reservation of specific trades to&#13;
certain ethnic groups is disappearing. The level of schooling before apprenticeship is also increasing: 68%&#13;
of apprentices surveved in 1994 were literate, whereas 10 years ago apprentices typically had no schooling&#13;
whatsoever. This means that apprentices are increasingly able to read diagrams and learn theoretical&#13;
principles to support their practical training, although few master artisans are able to provide this kind of&#13;
instruction (60% of artisans never attended primary school).&#13;
Skills Upgrading&#13;
2.8    24 public and 13 private skills upgrading centers exist, almost all in Bamako. Public centers are&#13;
associated with specific ministries and train mainly civil servants and parastatal employees, while private&#13;
centers offer training in management, computing and office skills, but rarely technical/industrial skills. To&#13;
finance skills upgrading and employment services for formal private and parastatal enterprises, employers&#13;
pay an "employment services tax", equal to 1% of the payroll, which generates about 450 million CFAF&#13;
per year (roughly 20% of public pre-service VET expenditures). In practice, however, this money is&#13;
simply allocated to the National Employment and Manpower Office (ONMOE) and used for financing of&#13;
administrative costs. job placement, labor market surveys, and the operation of a small secretarial and&#13;
accounting training center used primarily by public and parastatal sector workers.&#13;
2.9   In the informal sector. considerable skills upgrading goes on, although this is difficult to distinguish&#13;
from the informal apprenticeship system. The more successful master artisans may have three classes of&#13;
workers under them: full-time skilled workers who perform a wide range of tasks, third- or fourth-year&#13;
apprentices who perform a limited range of tasks, and newly-recruited apprentices who are confined to&#13;
observing, cleaning and other non-skilled activities. Many artisans now belong to craft guilds, which offer&#13;
limited training in both technical and managerial aspects of their businesses to regular employees. Lastly,&#13;
Mali's NGOs provide significant skills upgrading opportunities in management, accounting, project&#13;
feasibilitv analvsis, etc., but very little in terms of industrial/technical skills.&#13;
B.    CONSTRAINTS TO DEVELOPMENT OF VET SERVICES&#13;
Constraints to Pre-Service VET&#13;
2.10   Summary:    The pre-service VET training system, designed to prepare youth for entry into the&#13;
labor market, is poorly adapted to labor market demand, of low quality, inefficient, inequitable.&#13;
inappropriatelv administered, inadequately financed, lacking in diversity and flexibility, and insufficiently&#13;
informed. However, this is due primarily to neglect - the system retains considerable potential to contribute&#13;
to Mali's economic development, provided that appropriate reforms and investments are carried out.&#13;
2.11   Pre-service VET is poorly adapted to labor market demand, mainly because it has been driven&#13;
bv the logic of student flow management, a response to the Government's obligation to enroll all graduates&#13;
from basic education at the secondary level. [Note: a new policy of access to secondary education, based on&#13;
academic performance and enrollment capacity, is being implemented as of school year 1995/96, under the&#13;
Mali Education Sector Adjustment Loan.] That is, the gradual expansion of basic education has resulted in&#13;
more graduates than public secondary and higher education institutions can accommodate, which has led&#13;
the Government to orient "surplus" students to private, tertiary VET institutions, which receive public&#13;
subsidies on a per student basis. While a good idea in principle, these private schools offer almost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
exclusively tertiary sector training (because it is cheaper), and systematically overstate their capacity in&#13;
order to receive as many students as possible, which results in serious overcrowding and poor instruction.&#13;
Tertiary VET (which enrolls 75% of all VET students) has become a kind of "release valve" to move&#13;
students out of the education system, and produces graduates with skills for which the labor market is&#13;
largely saturated.    Meanwhile, labor market studies show increasing demand for skilled mechanics,&#13;
metalworkers, electricians, builders and accountants, but current capacity allows just 25% of VET&#13;
students to pursue industrial/technical training. Furthermore, the programs which exist are too theoretical&#13;
and designed to produce supervisors and foremen, not skilled workers. In fact, many employers are&#13;
reluctant to hire VET graduates who believe they are "above" performing skilled manual labor.&#13;
2.12   The quality of pre-service VET is very low, whether assessed in terms of equipment, instruction,&#13;
curricula, examinations or employer opinions. Particularly at the CAP level, training facilities are obsolete&#13;
(the Vocational Training Center was last equipped by the Soviets in 1962), while minimal operations and&#13;
maintenance budgets cannot maintain what little remains. Most buildings are old and in need of repair and&#13;
renovation to protect equipment from theft and weather. The quality of instruction is poor: 40% of VET&#13;
instructors are uncertified contractors, most of whom are recent graduates of BT and CAP programs, with&#13;
little practical experience in the private sector. There are few qualified trainers and inspectors. The content&#13;
and duration of VET programs are rigid, reflecting educational goals and academic concerns rather than&#13;
labor market skills requirements. Examinations are mainly theoretical and academic, rather than&#13;
assessments of practical competencies. The average repetition rate among CAP students is 30%, and&#13;
failure rates on the CAP exam average 65%. Most importantly, poor quality is revealed in the opinions of&#13;
modem sector employers, many of whom express dissatisfaction with pre-service VET trainees and&#13;
consequent reluctance to employ them. The low quality of VET thus defeats its purpose.&#13;
2.13   Pre-Service VET services are inefficient and inequitable. Teaching workloads are low: the full-&#13;
time load is just 18 hours per week, but the average instructor works only 14 hours per week. The average&#13;
student:teacher ratio is 14: 1, but this varies from 3:1 to 23: 1, depending on the institution and training&#13;
stream. Girls are underrepresented, accounting for only 26% of VET enrollments, in part due to extremely&#13;
low girls' enrollment rates at the basic education level (about one-third of primary enrollnent). 83% of&#13;
girls are enrolled in tertiary sector training (secretarial skills, accounting, office/administration skills, etc.).&#13;
Finally, access to VET is geographicallv inequitable - with 90% of all training places in Bamako, youth&#13;
outside the capital have verv limited access to VET services, even though 40% of the formal labor market&#13;
and most of the informal labor market is outside the capital.&#13;
2.14   Management of VET is inflexible and inadequate. Insufficient leeway is accorded to school&#13;
directors to administer, recruit trainers and students, mobilize resources, and adapt curricula. There is little&#13;
or no participation by employers, artisans or the ONMOE in curriculum design, student orientation,&#13;
financing or practical training activities. At the central level, institutional capacity of the DNETP is weak,&#13;
with few qualified staff and inadequate resources to efficientlv allocate student places, teachers, materials,&#13;
etc., and monitor their utilization.&#13;
2.15   VET is underfunded and its financing is mismanaged. Not enough resources are allocated to&#13;
materials and maintenance expenditures, while too much is spent on student scholarships and other&#13;
subsidies (uniforms, notebooks, etc.). Investment financing is negligible, and cost recoverv in the public&#13;
system is not practiced. Almost 3/4 of public VET expenditures go to tertiary training, although the&#13;
demand in the labor market is primarily for industrial training. The informal sector receives no public&#13;
financing whatsoever, although it trains three times as many youth as the formal system. (Additional details&#13;
on sector financing, budgetarv allocations and actual VET expenditures are provided in Annex 4.1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.16   Inadequate labor market information limits the ability to adapt VET services to labor market&#13;
demand. Labor market statistics are only collected in the modem sector, providing an inadequate basis for&#13;
analyses of employment trends, earnings, labor mobility and detection of skills shortages. At the ONMOE,&#13;
job vacancy data is sporadically collected, employer surveys are rarely conducted, job counseling is&#13;
minimal, placement services are slow and unreliable, and few enterprises inform the ONMOE of manpower&#13;
needs. Coordination with other agencies collecting labor market information is poor. Beyond collection of&#13;
labor market information, there is little analvsis and dissemination of information for policvmakers, training&#13;
institutions, and the public at large (especiallv parents and students), which means labor market&#13;
information is not used for VET planning and resource allocation.&#13;
Constraints to In-Service VET&#13;
Apprenliceship Training&#13;
2.17   Non-fornal apprenticeship training suffers from pedagogic, economic and social constraints, each&#13;
of which is discussed below.&#13;
2.18   Pedagogic: Apprentices learn through observation, imitation, and trial and error. While effective&#13;
in developing practical skills, such training offers few opportunities to learn the basic principles and theory&#13;
behind the practical skills. Secondly, innovation and the acquisition of new technologies are not favored by&#13;
simple repetition of tasks - current apprenticeship training locks the informal sector in a low-technology&#13;
loop. Thirdly, there is no logical sequence or structure to the training and skills acquired, no conmnon set&#13;
of standards for each trade, nor any certification procedure (an important labor market signal), so trained&#13;
apprentices have difficulty establishing themselves on their own. Finally, training is almost exclusively in&#13;
national languages and most master artisans are illiterate, which means little use of instruction manuals,&#13;
blueprints or other written materials, even though almost 70% of apprentices surveyed in 1994 stated they&#13;
were literate and numerate. This limnits the extent of instruction and lengthens the training period.&#13;
2.19   Economic: In the informal sector, the daily struggle is simply to survive - the evening's meal is&#13;
often paid for from the receipts of the day. This means few resources are available for training per se.&#13;
Because apprenticeship training is a by-product of production, it is a function of the contracts gained by the&#13;
master artisan. The more orders placed and the greater their diversity, the faster and broader is the training&#13;
acquired by apprentices; on the other hand, during slow periods apprentices may learn nothing at all.&#13;
Thirdly, because of limited client purchasing power, demand is often for final products of very low quality,&#13;
which restricts the skills apprentices can acquire. Finally, the master artisan must guard against future&#13;
competition, and so may withhold certain trade secrets to prevent the apprentice from setting up his or her&#13;
own business.&#13;
2.20   Social: Apprenticeship training depends on the personal relationship between the master artisan&#13;
and the apprentice (and often the apprentice's family). It is unregulated, with no written contracts. The&#13;
process is long, on average about 5 years, but lasting up to 10 years. Apprenticeship typically ends when&#13;
the master decides the apprentice has learned all the master can teach. Because the master artisan has an&#13;
interest in retaining the apprentice's cheap, skilled labor (and preventing competition), this decision is often&#13;
delayed - the apprentice must defer to his elders and can be locked into a form of social bondage. Secondly,&#13;
apprenticeship training is not valued by society as a whole. While within the trade it has a time-honored&#13;
place and is essential for the trade's continuity, it is often described as the "wastebasket" for youth outside&#13;
the formal education system (which offers diplomas and social status). Until recently, governnent cadres&#13;
(most of wvhom have formal education degrees and middle class status) showed little interest in supporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
apprenticeship training with public resources. This results in a vicious circle of poor training quality, weak&#13;
trainee marketability, and low status of apprenticeship training.&#13;
Skills Upgrading&#13;
2.21   Skills upgrading services are simnply inadequate, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Employers&#13;
in the formal and nonformal private sectors invest little in skills upgrading, in part because many of them&#13;
function on the edge of bankruptcy and cannot afford to invest for medium-term pay-offs. In addition,&#13;
because the modem sector and the average size of firmns are small, there is little demand to develop&#13;
enterprise-based training capacity. Poorly organized trade associations are another inhibiting factor, as is&#13;
Mali's history of state domination of the means of production. Although the Governent maintains skills&#13;
upgrading centers for public employees in civil works, electricity, transport, textiles and construction, these&#13;
facilities have not been available to the private sector. From the employee perspective, there is little&#13;
incentive to invest in skills upgrading which does not lead to a government-sanctioned diploma, because the&#13;
administered wage system in the modern sector is based on diplomas and seniority, not on productivity, and&#13;
because promotions are often based on family and social relations.&#13;
2.22   While recent surveys suggest that private sector employers consider product quality and&#13;
productivitv as the key factors in their competitiveness in national and regional markets, few employers&#13;
make the link between these factors and skills development. Those that do cite the poor quality of existing&#13;
training services in Mali and the excessively high costs of sending workers abroad as constraints to&#13;
investments in skills upgrading. On the other hand, they indicate a willingness to pay for quality, local&#13;
training adapted to their specific needs.&#13;
2.23   Women's access to skills upgrading opportunities is particularly restricted. Not only are they&#13;
subject to the same constraints as men (e.g. the cost of training, distance to training sites, lack of employer&#13;
concern, etc.), but they also must overcome additional constraints related to their domestic responsibilities.&#13;
Simply put, working women have less disposable time in Mali than most men, because they must also take&#13;
care of the children, cook, clean, wash, fetch water, etc.. In a recently conducted survey, many women also&#13;
complained of reluctance on their husbands' part to let them participate in training activities, much less use&#13;
household money to pay for such training. Finally, these additional constraints to training should be viewed&#13;
in light of women's relatively greater training needs: working women's literacy, numeracy, technical and&#13;
managerial skills are far below those of their male counterparts.&#13;
C. THE GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.24   The Government's education and training strategy is articulated in an Education Sector&#13;
Development Policy Letter issued in December 1994 (included as part of the Mali Education SECAL).&#13;
The two principal objectives of this strategy are to (1) improve the access and quality of primary education&#13;
and (2) adapt the education system to labor market demand, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The first&#13;
objective is being pursued through the Education SECAL and the recently-identified Education Sector&#13;
Investment Program. The second objective includes inter alia the consolidation of vocational education and&#13;
training.&#13;
2.25   In the VET sub-sector, the Government's strategy is based on extensive sector work undertaken by&#13;
the MESSRS with support from the World Bank, ACDI, UNDP, ILO and UNESCO, complemented by&#13;
nearly constant policy dialogue with the Bank since the summer of 1993. The Government intends to: (a)&#13;
restore the quality of pre-service VET; (b) transform public VET institutions into full-service VET centers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Il&#13;
offering pre- and in- service training; (c) improve the system's links and responsiveness to labor market&#13;
demand; (d) develop training for the informal sector; (e) expand private sector participation in financing&#13;
and management of training programs; (f) enhance management autonomy of VET institutions; (g) increase&#13;
recurrent cost financing for equipment, maintenance and materials; (h) phase out obsolete training streams&#13;
and (i) respect enrollment capacities of training streams. Overall, this sub-sector VET strategy&#13;
corresponds closely to the Bank's institutional policy with respect to VET. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that, at all times during project implementation, it would limit enrollment&#13;
in VET institutions to a level compatible with the capacity of practical trainingfacilities, which is based&#13;
on the number offiznctional work stations for each training stream (para 7. I-a).&#13;
2.26   The Government's employment strategy defines the private sector as the engine of economic&#13;
growth and labor demand. In addition to maintaining a favorable macroeconormic environment and&#13;
liberalizing the agricultural and industrial sectors, the Government intends to lower the costs of doing&#13;
business (fiscal and regulatory reform) and to strengthen intermediary institutions which link producers&#13;
with markets, finance and training services. Related to this is the recent adoption of legal texts creating the&#13;
Employment and Training Observatory, to be linked with the National Manpower and Employment Office&#13;
(ONMOE). The Observatory's role will be to collect, analyze and disseminate labor market information&#13;
for policymakers, VET administrators, employers, students and investors, in order to promote a more&#13;
efficient labor market.&#13;
2.27   In addition. the Government has a specific strategy for developing the informal sector, which&#13;
includes a strengthened institutional framework, promotion of local handicrafts, and improved access to&#13;
credit, public bidding and training. In 1992 the National Federation of Malian Artisans (FNAM) was&#13;
established, comprising 104 artisan associations, followed bv the creation of the Chamber of Trades&#13;
(distinct from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry) in 1993. In 1994 a new Code d'Artisanat was&#13;
passed, which officially recognizes the rights and obligations of the informal sector, and provides a legal&#13;
structure which should help informal artisans develop into formal sector employers. A key aspect of this&#13;
strategy is the development of a sustainable skills upgrading capacity adapted to informal sector needs.&#13;
2.28   These strategies are spelled out in a signed Letter of VET and Employment Development Policy&#13;
(see Annex 1.1), a draft of which was discussed during negotiations.&#13;
D.    THE BANK GROUP'S EXPERIENCE AND ROLE&#13;
2.29   Experience. Since 1973 the Bank has financed five education projects in Mali, one of which is&#13;
ongoing. The first two projects (Cr. No.420-MLI, for US$5 million, signed in July 1973 and closed in&#13;
August 1980, and Cr. No. 733-MLI, for US$10 million, signed in September 1977 and closed in June&#13;
1983) targeted science and technology in lower secondary schools, rehabilitation/expansion of an upper&#13;
secondary-level VET institution (ECICA), agricultural education, and the development of low-cost basic&#13;
education. The third project (Cr. 1442-MLI, for US$9.5 million, signed in July 1984 and closed in&#13;
September 1990) aimed at improving access and quality of basic education, developing VET management&#13;
capacity, expanding non-formal adult education, and improving agricultural extension skills. The fourth&#13;
education project (Cr. No. 2054-MLI, for US$26 million, signed in 1989 and closed in December 1995)&#13;
aimed to develop basic education, quantitatively and qualitatively, while laying the groundwork for&#13;
restructuring of secondary and higher education. Finally, the Education Sector Adjustment Loan (Cr. No.&#13;
2673-MLI for US$50 million, signed in January 1995 and expected to close in December 1996), targets&#13;
reforms to correct sector resource allocation distortions in order to develop basic education and improve&#13;
educational quality at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.30   The PCR for the First Education Project (March 1982) concluded implementation was satisfactory&#13;
overall, with most project objectives achieved. Regarding the VET component, the PCR stated in the&#13;
project outcomes section that ECICA was fully operational, providing improved and more relevant&#13;
vocational education and training. The PCR for the Second Education Project (September 1985) was&#13;
largely unsatisfactory, citing problems with physical implementation, project management, and counterpart&#13;
funding. The Performance Audit for the Third Education Project (August 1995) found that the project&#13;
objectives of improving the DNETP's VET management capacity were achieved, while those for basic and&#13;
agricultural education were only partiallv attained, due primarily to underutilization of facilities and lack of&#13;
maintenance. As for the Fourth Education Project, its investment component (consisting of teacher&#13;
training, curricula revision, educational materials supply, classroom construction, etc.) was satisfactorily&#13;
implemented and its primary education enrollment rate target was reached, while the second and third&#13;
tranches of the adjustment component were canceled in 1993 due to the Government's inability to&#13;
implement the agreed-upon reforms. These reform measures were integrated into the Education SECAL, of&#13;
which the first tranche was released in March 1995 following satisfactory implementation of the initial&#13;
reforms. The second tranche of the Education SECAL has not yet been released, pending completion of&#13;
several outstanding sector reforms.&#13;
2.31    Lessons Learned. The Bank's expenrence suggests numerous lessons to be incorporated in the&#13;
Bank's education and training strategy for Mali. (i) Quality pnrmary and lower secondary education are&#13;
critical to success in vocational training programs. This lesson is reflected through IDA's IV Education&#13;
Project, the Education SECAL, and the recently-identified Education Sector Investment Program. (ii)&#13;
Public pre-service training in secondary vocational schools may be justified when employer and private&#13;
training capacity is weak, but these programs require sufficient recurrent cost funding and a strong market&#13;
orientation in planning and institutional responsiveness. For example, the PCR of the Mali First Education&#13;
Project found the VET component particularly successful and stated that additional IDA inputs would have&#13;
been helpful, especially if employers contributed more to the design of practical training programs, and&#13;
adequate public funds were budgeted for ECICA's operational costs. During preparation of the proposed&#13;
VET project, emplovers were involved in both research and project design, and seven labor market studies&#13;
were undertaken to ensure VET/market orientation. Under the project, recurrent cost funding norms would&#13;
be increased, emplovers would be included in both pre- and in-service VET management, and labor market&#13;
studies would be continued through the Employment and Training Observatory. (iii) Practical&#13;
apprenticeship programs mav be cost-effective complements to theoretical training. The project proposes to&#13;
provide structure, certification and extensive financing for the expansion of apprenticeship training. (iv)&#13;
Public and private training and skills upgrading institutions must function in the marketplace, and be adept&#13;
at changing enrollments and curricula to adjust to employment opportunities for trainees. This would be&#13;
ensured through application of flexible, labor market-based criteria for the financing of skills upgrading&#13;
activities, which would be managed primarily by private sector employers and artisans. (v) Diversification&#13;
of financing is important for both sustainability and equity in sharing of costs and benefits. Under the&#13;
project, the introduction of a Vocational Training Tax (equivalent to 0.5% of the private and parastatal&#13;
payroll), plus the 25% counterpart contribution for all VTSF-financed training (paid by the trainees, their&#13;
employers or their sponsors), would ensure sustainability and introduce VET cost recovery for the first&#13;
time in Mali. (vi) The impact of training programs should be carefully monitored, to ensure cost-&#13;
effectiveness of public funds and to verify that course content and training modalities are responsive to&#13;
labor market needs. Annual graduate tracer studies and mandatory evaluation of all skills upgrading&#13;
activities would be financed under the project.&#13;
2.32   The Bank's experience over time in financing vocational training funds is quite limited, although&#13;
numerous funds are currently being financed (Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Togo, Albania, and&#13;
Macedonia). Specific advantages offered by such funds are flexibility, private sector governance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
demand-driven training. Implementation problems witnessed so far have included both demand and supply&#13;
constraints to meeting the proposed training and disbursement targets. including insufficient public&#13;
awareness, the level of beneficiarv contribution required, the ability of training sponsors to prepare training&#13;
requests, and the limited variety and supplv of training service providers. The project's Vocational&#13;
Training Support Fund would provide specific resources for promotional activities, the preparation of&#13;
training requests, and expansion/diversification of skills upgrading capacity. Project mid-term review&#13;
criteria would include an examination of performance benchmarks for the Training Fund, and corrective&#13;
action would be taken if necessarv.&#13;
2.33   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Human resources development is one of the pillars of the Bank's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in Mali, and will remain so over the medium-term, complementing&#13;
efforts to generate sustained broad-based economic growth while focusing on the needs of the most&#13;
vulnerable. Without a dramatic improvement in education attainment and skills development, Mali cannot&#13;
hope to generate or sustain rates of growth needed to overcome poverty. The proposed project addresses&#13;
this need directly and is included as an essential investment operation in the CAS, discussed by the Board&#13;
on January 5, 1995.&#13;
2.34   Secondlv, the Bank's long experience in Malian education, training and labor market issues, and&#13;
the proposed project's links to ongoing projects, gives the Bank a comparative advantage in this sub-sector.&#13;
Under the IV Education Project, several labor market and training studies. and the identification for the&#13;
proposed project, were financed. Under the Education SECAL, sectoral reforms regarding educational&#13;
quality, student scholarships, and student flow controls are being implemented and would be complemented&#13;
by investments under the proposed project. As for labor market issues, the Bank's first Structural&#13;
Adjustment Loan included the revision of the Labor Code in 1992, and further implementation of this Code&#13;
is foreseen under the 1995-97 Policv Framework Paper agreed to by the Bank, the IMF and the&#13;
Government. The VET project would build on these labor market reforms and facilitate labor mobilitv and&#13;
flexibility through improved information and feedback into programming of VET resources. Finally, the&#13;
VET project would complement the Bank's industrv. infrastructure and agriculture projects in Mali, such&#13;
as AGETIPE. Private Sector Promotion, Transport Sector, and Agro-processing.&#13;
2.35   Thirdly, the Bank has plaved a lead role in defining and operationalizing VET and labor market&#13;
policies, which are now shared amongst all donors active in the sector. Indeed, French Cooperation (FAC)&#13;
has agreed to parallel finance certain project activities, and has proposed funding kev technical assistance&#13;
of this project. Since 1993, the Canadians and the Bank have worked closely regarding their financing of&#13;
VET curriculum reforms, which would be integrated and extended to other training streams under the&#13;
project. Thirdly, a Swiss-financed NGO (SwissContact) and the Bank developed a close working&#13;
relationship, particularly in the design of the proposed Vocational Training Support Fund and including the&#13;
co-financing of certain project preparation activities. Finallv, the Bank and the ILO collaborated in the&#13;
design of the proposal for the Employment and Training Observatorv.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
3.1    Development Objectives: The proposed project aims to contribute to economic growth and human&#13;
resources development, targeting in particular the skill requirements of relatively poor urban groups in the&#13;
informal sector. Related objectives are to improve local capacity to allocate training resources as a function&#13;
of labor market demand, and to increase the involvement of the private sector in the management, provision&#13;
and financing of VET.&#13;
3.2   Implementation Objectives: The project's implementation objectives are to develop labor force&#13;
skills and productivitv through improved quality. supply and responsiveness of vocational education and&#13;
training services, adapted to labor market demand. Over the life of the project, approximately 40,000&#13;
workers and apprentices would benefit from in-service skills upgrading, while another 6,000 youth would&#13;
benefit from pre-service vocational training. It is expected that at least 75% of project trainees would be&#13;
employed within three years of training, with incomes sufficient to generate at least a 16% social rate of&#13;
return to project investments.&#13;
3.3    Project Scope: To achieve these objectives, the project would finance: (a) the consolidation of&#13;
pre-service VET services, by upgrading facilities, revising curricula, improving teacher quality, and&#13;
increasing management capacity; (b) the establishment of a Vocational Training Support Fund, to develop&#13;
demand-driven, employer-financed skills upgrading and apprenticeship training; and (c) the establishment&#13;
of an Employment and Training Observatory, to improve labor market information analysis and&#13;
dissemination. This investment programn would be executed within a Policy Franework for VET services&#13;
and employment (described in paras. 2.24-2.28). The following table sunmmarizes the components.&#13;
VET Consolidation Project Components (including taxes and contingencies)&#13;
1.    Pre-Service VET Services (US$ 9.2 million)&#13;
(i)    upgrade training facilities;&#13;
(ii)   improve quality and skills of instructors and revise curricula; and&#13;
(iii)   develop management capacity at school and central levels.&#13;
2.     Vocational Training Support Fund (US$ 12.0 million)&#13;
(i)    finance and develop demand-driven skills upgrading and apprenticeship training; and&#13;
(ii)   develop national certification standards for apprenticeship training.&#13;
3.    Employment and Training Observatory (US$ 1.7 million)&#13;
(i)   finance necessary equipment, materials and infrastructure;&#13;
(ii)   train Observatory staff in labor market analysis and its links to VET,&#13;
(iii)   conduct labor market and training surveys; and&#13;
(iv)   disseminate labor market information to policymakers and potential training&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
COMPONENT 1 -    PRE-SERVICE VET SERVICES (US$ 9.2 MILLION)&#13;
3.4    Objectives: The objectives of this component are to improve the quality, supply, efficiency and&#13;
relevance of pre-service VET services. in order to provide young trainees with the knowledge and skills&#13;
demanded in the labor market, therebv irnproving their employment prospects. Approximately 1,200 youth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
would benefit each year from this training. Related objectives are to increase the responsiveness and&#13;
flexibilitv of the formal training system to adapt to changing labor market needs, to expand employer&#13;
involvement and to ensure maximum utilization of existing VET capacity.&#13;
3.5    Project Support: For each training stream selected for reinforcement, the project would finance&#13;
civil works, equipment, didactic materials, training and technical assistance. Training programs would be&#13;
revised and instructors re-trained before hardware investments are made, in order to introduce modular,&#13;
competency-based training programs which emphasize mastery of practical skills and flexibility. At the&#13;
same time, training programns for skills which are less in demand in the labor market would be downsized or&#13;
completely phased out.&#13;
3.6    As part of project preparation all legal and administrative texts concerning pre-service vocational&#13;
training are being revised. This revision includes changes in the management, roles, financing and services&#13;
of pre-service VET institutions, involving private sector employers and enabling VET institutions to&#13;
provide (and charge for) in-service and apprenticeship training. Texts concerning curricula, duration of&#13;
training programs, assessment, instructor recruitment, etc., are also being revised for greater flexibility and&#13;
responsiveness to the labor market. The enactment of all revised legal and administrative texts concerning&#13;
pre-service vocational training would be a condition of project effectiveness (para. 7.2-a).&#13;
Sub-Component 1.1 - Upgrade Training Facilities (US$ 5.4 million)&#13;
3.7    Five training facilities have been selected for upgrading. The five training facilities are: the&#13;
Vocational Training Center (CFP). the School for Commerce, Industry and Administration (ECICA), and&#13;
the Institutes for Vocational Training (IFPs) in Sikasso, Kayes and San. These facilities offer two-year&#13;
training programs (grades 10/11) leading to the Certificat d Aptitude Professionnel (CAP), with the&#13;
exception of ECICA which offers the 4-vear Brevet Technicien (BT). Such programs correspond to mid-&#13;
level skilled workers, able and willing to perform skilled tasks with the possibility of supervising others.&#13;
The five facilities were selected for their proximity to capital and regional labor markets: Sikasso is in the&#13;
cotton-growing region and a major transportation hub; San covers the rice-growing regions and is nid-way&#13;
between the regional capitals of Segou and Mopti; Kayes is the primary mining region and is expected to&#13;
grow substantially over the next 5-10 years. w-ith development of the Manantali Dam area, electrification,&#13;
cotton. and road construction.&#13;
3.8    The training streams selected for project support include: mechanics (general and vehicle),&#13;
construction, metalwork, electrical contracting, woodworking, electro-mechanics and accounting. These&#13;
were identified based on the seven labor market and training surveys conducted dunrng project preparation&#13;
(see Annex 2.2 for more details), which indicate significant growth in production and emplovment over the&#13;
medium term in textiles, agro-industry, simple import substitution, construction, public works, transport,&#13;
hotels and tourism, crafts, small and medium enterprises. Seven training specialties would be reinforced at&#13;
the CFP, two at ECICA, two at the IFPs in Kayes and San, and one at the IFP in Sikasso. All training&#13;
would be at the CAP-level, with the exception of electro-mechanics and accounting, which would be at the&#13;
BT-level. In addition, studies would be conducted for the development of two new training streams in agro-&#13;
processing and mining.&#13;
3.9    In conjunction with new investments, Government gave assurances that as of school year 1995-&#13;
1996 it would phase out training streams in customs, workers' rights, and taxation, and would reduce the&#13;
size of training streams for geometry and industrial chemistry by 50% (all at the BT level) (para 7. 1-b).&#13;
These training streams remain from when the Government recruited all BT graduates into the civil service;&#13;
current surveys of private sector training needs indicate virtually no demand at this time for graduates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
trained in these areas at this level. In parallel, the DNETP would consolidate four CAP-level tertiary sector&#13;
training streams into two: accounting and office work. The IFPs would gradually phase out BT-level&#13;
tertiarv training, and would focus on the CAP. By investing in training streams demanded in the labor&#13;
market, closing or downsizing others, and merging overly specific training to increase flexibility, the project&#13;
would truly consolidate pre-service VET training in the fullest sense of the word.&#13;
Sub-Component 1.2 - Improve Quality of Instruction (US$ 3.3 million)&#13;
3.10   Curriculum Reform. For each training stream selected for reinforcement, the curniculum would be&#13;
revised to adopt a modular, competency-based approach, emphasizing transferable practical and&#13;
entrepreneurial skills. The modular approach would increase flexibility and could be used for skills&#13;
upgrading and apprenticeship training, as well. The DNETP has already revised two training programs&#13;
(auto and electrical mechanics) with Canadian support over the past two years. Extensive training and&#13;
technical assistance provided over this period means the DNETP is now capable of revising other trang&#13;
programs with only limited external assistance. By 1999 all curricula revisions would be completed (see&#13;
Project Implementation Plan for details). A total of 3 months of training and TA per training stream would&#13;
be financed under the project to revise curricula.&#13;
3. 11   Training.    The revision of training programs would require a major investment in the re-&#13;
training of instructors. All instructors would receive three months of intensive training during school&#13;
vacations in the competency-based, modular approach, as well as in the use of new equipment and&#13;
materials. Training of trainers would be provided by specialists from the National Department of&#13;
Vocational and Technical Training of the Ministrv of Education of Quebec through a twinning arrangement&#13;
(see para. 3.15). These specialists would be senior technical support staff, with extensive experience and&#13;
training in the competencv-based, modular approach and familiaritv with the equipment which would be&#13;
financed under the project. Instructors in each training stream would also benefit from two months of&#13;
technical assistance during the school vear, for each of the first three years using the revised programs.&#13;
Training both before and during the school year should enable teachers to fully absorb and apply the&#13;
revised training programs. A comprehensive personnel utilization-rotation plan was submitted to IDA&#13;
before negotiations. to ensure adequate and appropriate staffing of regional IFPs, particularly for training&#13;
streams to be strengthened under the project.&#13;
3.12   Training and Enterprise Support Units.     An important aspect of imnproving the quality and&#13;
relevance of VET instruction is ensuring that instructors know and understand the labor market and private&#13;
sector enterprises for which their students are being trained. One mechanism for ensuring these links&#13;
between training and employment would be the creation of training and enterprise support units ("unites de&#13;
formation et d'appui aux entreprises") within VET institutions. This unit would be composed of VET&#13;
instructors who, in addition to their normal teaching workload, would market their services on a partial&#13;
cost-recoverv basis to private and parastatal enterprises for the identification of training needs and the&#13;
development of training programs for their employees. (Note: enterprises could then submit these training&#13;
programs for funding to the Vocational Training Support Fund, see Component 2.) FAC financing wvould&#13;
provide training and 5 long-term technical assistants to assist VET instructors in job functional analysis,&#13;
skills identification, and modular training program development. Limited equipment and furniture needs&#13;
for the training and enterprise support units would also be financed by FAC under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Sub-Component 1.3 - Develop Management Capacity at Central and School Levels (US$&#13;
0.5 million)&#13;
3. 13   At the central level, the DNETP would be strengthened under the project, with new offices,&#13;
equipment, training and technical assistance in the following areas: curricular reform; pedagogical support;&#13;
utilization/rationalization of capacity (buildings, equipment and instructors); labor market analysis;&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; and management decentralization. A total of 20 person/months of international&#13;
short-term TA would be financed under the project. Proof that the Government has obtained all&#13;
necessary authorizations for the works to be carried out under the project would be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for this component (para 7.3-a).&#13;
3. 14   At the school level, directors would receive training in the transformation of pre-service VET&#13;
facilities into full-service training centers (offering skills upgrading, apprenticeship trai ing. and enterprise&#13;
support, in addition to pre-service VET). In addition, directors and supervisors ("chefs des travaux")&#13;
would participate in training for instructors.&#13;
3.15   Given the range of VET instructor and management training required, the project would support an&#13;
"institutional twinning" arrangement between the DNETP and the Department for Vocational Education&#13;
and Training Nvithin the Ministry of Education of Quebec. Since 1986 Quebec's VET institutions have&#13;
undertaken a major reform, significantly improving their quality, efficiency, flexibility, and responsiveness&#13;
to the labor market. The Government of Mali has expressed to the Ministry of Education in Quebec its&#13;
interest in learning from the Quebec experience, to which the Ministrv of Education in Quebec has&#13;
responded favorably in writing. While such an arrangement would ensure a certain consistency and&#13;
svnergy in training and technical assistance activities, Mali would nevertheless be free to recruit necessary&#13;
trainers and technical assistants elsewhere. The objective would be to put at the DNETP's disposal a&#13;
coherent pool of talent and experience in VET reform which could be easily accessed. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the Government submitted to IDA draft TORs for TA to be provided to the DNETP under the&#13;
project.&#13;
COMPONENT 2 - VOCATIONAL TRAINING SUPPORT FUND (VTSF) FOR SKILLS UPGRADING&#13;
(US$ 12.0 MILLION)&#13;
3.16   Objectives: The objectives of this component are to improve the quality and capacity of skills&#13;
upgrading services, in order to enhance labor force skills and productivity among formal and informal&#13;
sector workers. In addition, the VTSF aims to involve employers in financing and managing training for&#13;
their workers, expand private training capacity, develop apprenticeship training certification criteria, and&#13;
provide incentives for adopting more cost-efficient modes of training for critically needed skills areas. Over&#13;
the five years of the project (1997-2001), annual through-put of in-service trainees is expected to rise from&#13;
3,000 to 10,000. The medium-term objective is to establish a sustainable "market" for skills upgrading in&#13;
Mali.&#13;
3.17   Project Support: Through the establishment of a Vocational Training Support Fund (VTSF), the&#13;
project would finance demand-driven skills upgrading and retraining of workers in both formal and&#13;
informal sector enterpnrses, and would support apprenticeship training for young school leavers already&#13;
active in the informal labor market. The VTSF would also help enterprises to identify their training needs,&#13;
and translate those needs into viable training requests and programs. Promotional and other IEC activities&#13;
regarding the VTSF would be financed to specific target groups (e.g. women), to ensure wide participation&#13;
in VTSF activities. The project would also finance equipment and materials to develop private skills&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
upgrading capacity and diversity. An important feature of the VTSF would be the Government's&#13;
introduction of a Vocational Training Tax which would ensure a sustainable source of employer financing&#13;
long after the project ends. This would be equivalent to 0.5% of the private and parastatal sector payroll,&#13;
and would be accompanied by a reduction of other payroll taxes so the net fiscal burden on employers and&#13;
labor costs would be unchanged. (The National Federation of Malian Employers was closely involved&#13;
during project preparation and has officially stated its support for this measure in a letter to the Minister of&#13;
Finance and Commerce.) The VTSF would be a non-profit agency whose financing would be exempt from&#13;
taxes. As a condition of effectiveness, the Government would establish the kTSF and procedures for the&#13;
transfer of Government funds to the VTISF through a Subsidiary Grant Agreement (para 7.2-b). Adoption&#13;
of all necessary legislative and regulatory texts, acceptable to the Association, relating to the financing&#13;
by employers of VTSF activities would be a condition of disbursement for this component (para 7. 3-b).&#13;
3.18   The project would finance start-up and operating costs of the VTSF, including: recruitment of&#13;
personnel, renovation of offices, purchase and operation of office equipment and vehicles, training,&#13;
promotional activities, studies, contractual services and 3 long-term technical assistants (under FAC&#13;
financing). A total of 16 staff would be hired, including the General Director, eight technical specialists in&#13;
training, financial administration and procurement, two secretanres, an IEC/documentation specialist and&#13;
four service personnel. Total operating costs of the VTSF would not exceed 11% of total VTSF&#13;
expenditures. Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted to IDA for review the draft TORs for the&#13;
General Director and all technical personnel to be hired under the VTSF.&#13;
3.19   VTSF performance criteria and benchmarks (e.g. number of person-months of training, number of&#13;
training requests processed, level of employer contributions through the Vocational Training Tax, actual&#13;
versus projected disbursement, etc.) are included in the terms of reference for the project's mid-term review&#13;
which were agreed to during negotiations.&#13;
Sub-Component 2.1 - Skills Upgrading and Retraining (US$ 11.6 million)&#13;
3.20   The project would finance skills upgrading and retraining sub-projects, submitted by individuals,&#13;
private and parastatal firms, or organizations (such as NGOs). referred to here as "sponsors". Sponsors&#13;
would be responsible for identifying and expressing training needs of beneficiaries, and would typically&#13;
have direct links to them (e.g. as employer, master artisan or community organizer). Alternatively,&#13;
beneficiaries could simply organize themselves to present training requests. Two types of training sub-&#13;
projects wvould be financed: those for individual enterprises and those for groups of workers in either the&#13;
formal or informal labor market. The submission by the Government to IDA of the draft Operations&#13;
Manual for the VTSF, as part of the Project Implementation Plan, was a condition of negotiations. During&#13;
negotiations the Government gave assurances that it would operate the VITSF in accordance with the&#13;
VTSF Operations Manual, which would be acceptable at all times to IDA (para 7. 1-c).&#13;
3.21   The VTSF would contribute to financing of both recurrent and development costs of training&#13;
activities. In most cases it would finance 75% of training expenses (curriculum development, instruction,&#13;
materials, etc.) of each approved sub-project, with training beneficiaries and/or their sponsors contributing&#13;
the remaining 25%. Of this VTSF financing, employers and Government would provide one-third through&#13;
the Vocational Training Tax equivalent to 0.5% of payroll, while IDA and the FAC would provide the&#13;
other two-thirds. (In other words, of total training expenses, 25% would be financed by beneficiaries, 25%&#13;
by employers and Government, and 50% by IDA and the FAC.) For training of apprentices under 21 years&#13;
of age, the VTSF would finance 90% of training expenses, with 10% financed by apprentices and/or their&#13;
sponsors. In order to expand and upgrade private sector training capacity (commercial and non-profit), the&#13;
VTSF would also finance up to 50% of the cost of new equipment and materials through a combined grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
(25%) and 2.5%-interest loan (25%), with the training centers contributing the balance. The interest on&#13;
the loan would pay for loan administration and collection, and repayments would go into a revolving fund.&#13;
The Executive Secretanrat of the VTSF would verify that the balance of funds for each sub-project were in&#13;
fact contributed by the sponsors or other financing partners, and its verification would be subject to audit.&#13;
3.22   Training of private and public training center instructors would also be financed under the VTSF,&#13;
but under the same terns as those applied to other training beneficiaries, on the principle that public and&#13;
private training institutes should be willing to invest in their human resources like any other enterprise.&#13;
a.    Management of the VTSF&#13;
3.23   The VTSF would be administered by a Management Committee (MC), and operated on daily basis&#13;
by an Executive Secretariat (ES). The MC would be composed of 16 members, 12 from the private sector&#13;
and 4 from the Government. Industry, mining, agriculture, artisan, construction, services, NGOs and&#13;
unions would be represented, with representatives elected by the General Assemblies of their respective&#13;
professional associations. On the Government side, the Ministry of Industry, Crafts and Tourism, the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Commerce, the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service, and the Ministry of&#13;
Secondary and Higher Education, and of Scientific Research, would be represented, with the Ministry of&#13;
Industrv, Crafts and Tourism assuming overall Government supervision of the VTSF. A president and first&#13;
vice-president would be elected by the MC from among private sector representatives, with a second&#13;
permnanent vice-presidencv assumed bv the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. (The only responsibility of&#13;
the first vice-president would be to replace the president in case of the latter's absence.) The MC would&#13;
meet at least 4 times a year, or every three months, to review the Fund's activities and their correspondence&#13;
with financing criteria and guidelines, and to vote on training proposals in excess of US$50,000 submitted&#13;
by the Executive Secretariat.&#13;
3.24   The Executive Secretariat (ES) would (i) help enterprises and other beneficiaries identifv and&#13;
express their training needs. (ii) review, approve and, if needed, propose to the MC, training proposals, (iii)&#13;
select training providers through competitive bidding, and (iv) ensure appropriate monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of training activities. In addition, it would conduct targeted research into promising economic&#13;
sub-sectors worthy of training investments, carry out IEC and promotional campaigns, and handle all&#13;
administrative and financial aspects of the VTSF (procurement, accounting, etc.). A General Director&#13;
would oversee the activities of 4 Divisions: Skills and Apprenticeship Training; Enterprise-Based&#13;
Training; Promotion, Research and Evaluation; and Administration/Finance. In addition, the General&#13;
Director would be responsible for preparing and supervising the implementation of an annual work&#13;
program and budget. To promote the participation of women in training activities, the VTSF would have a&#13;
Women's Training Specialist, responsible for reaching out to women's groups, explaining how to access&#13;
VTSF resources, assisting in the preparation of training requests and ensuring that training activities are&#13;
adapted to women's specific needs.&#13;
3.25   In terms of financial management, the General Director of the ES and the permanent vice-president&#13;
would ensure the financial integrity of the Fund and authorize transfers of tax revenues to the VTSF.&#13;
Following registration at the National Tax Department, tax revenues would be deposited in a holding&#13;
account at the National Treasury on a daily basis. Each month the permanent vice-president (from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Commerce) would authorize the transfer of these funds to the VTSF's operating&#13;
account, provided that the previous month's actual cash flow reached at least 80% of projections and/or&#13;
operational account funds were less than 80% of estimated financing needs for the ensuing three months.&#13;
Revenues not transferred to the VTSF before June 30 and December 31 each year would be handed over&#13;
permanently to the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
b.     Criteria for VTSFfinancing&#13;
3.26   Each training sub-project would be evaluated for eligibility according to economic, pedagogic and&#13;
financial criteria. Economic criteria would include the training's relation to labor market demand, its likely&#13;
impact on productivity and employ-ment creation, and its targeting of priority populations. Labor market&#13;
demand would be substantiated through labor market studies, quantitative or qualitative, and/or willingness&#13;
to provide counterpart financing. Pedagogic criteria include the quality and adequacy of training in terms&#13;
of methodology, organization, duration, levels of skills targeted, instructional materials required, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation design. Financial critena would include the training's projected costs and their&#13;
comparison to reference unit costs for similar training, and the counterpart contribution proposed by the&#13;
sponsor. If the training sub-project is deemed eligible, the training provider would be selected through&#13;
local competitive bidding, open to previously qualified trainers and training institutions. Training would be&#13;
provided by private sector training centers (commercial and non-profit), consulting firms and public VET&#13;
institutions.&#13;
3.27   Within the ES, training information (costs, sectors of intervention, impact, qualified trainers, etc.)&#13;
would be collected and analyzed through an MIS. Training activities would be monitored and evaluated&#13;
according to specific criteria applied to: the training institutions (quality, internal efficiency, etc.); trainees&#13;
(percentage of trainees who acquired necessary skills, placement rate, etc.); firms (changes in product&#13;
quality, production costs, employment, etc.) and economic environment (overall skill levels, productivity,&#13;
exports, technology adaptation, etc.). In turn, this information would be used to refine financing criteria.&#13;
Sub-Component 2.2 - Apprenticeship Certification (US$ 0.4 million)&#13;
3.28   The project would support the development of a national system of apprenticeship certification,&#13;
providing an objective set of standards bv which to evaluate worker skills and develop apprenticeship&#13;
training programs. Standards would be established for 10 prioritv occupations/trades by Competency&#13;
Committees made up of employers, masters, qualified workers, and ministry of education personnel,&#13;
facilitated by experts in competencv-based functional analysis. For each trade the Competency Committee&#13;
would analyze the basic competencies that an apprentice should master for certification. These&#13;
competencies would then be translated into a modular, sequential apprenticeship training program. After&#13;
field tests and revisions, the final list of competencv standards would be submitted to the Competency&#13;
Committee for approval, along with a suggested training program. The project wvould finance technical&#13;
assistance, training and workshops for the competency committees, publishing and promotion of the&#13;
standards established. As part of project preparation, this process is being extensively tested and validated&#13;
for one trade (in collaboration with a Swiss NGO, SwissContact), which would then be applied to other&#13;
trades during the project.&#13;
CoMPONENT 3-EMPLOYMINT AND TRAINING OBSERVATORY (US$1.6 million)&#13;
3.29   Objective: The objective of this component is to increase employment and earnings through&#13;
improved functioning of the labor market and enhanced effectiveness of vocational training. This would be&#13;
achieved by establishing the Employment and Training Observatory (ETO), for monitoring, analysis and&#13;
dissemination of labor market information, with a special emphasis on the links between employment and&#13;
training policies and programs.&#13;
3.30   Project Support: The project would finance 4 sub-components to achieve this objective: (i)&#13;
establishment of the ETO (renovated offices, office equipment, furniture, etc.), as a quasi-autonomous&#13;
structure linked to the ONMOE, (ii) training in the collection and analysis of information pertaining to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
labor market and vocational training; (iii) studies and surveys to further understand the structure and&#13;
evolution of the formal and informal labor markets: and (iv) the development of institutional capacity for&#13;
the dissemination of this information to policvmakers and the public at large. During negotiations, the&#13;
ONMOE gave assurances that it would transfer to the ETO by May 31 of each year, commencing with&#13;
May 31, 1996, at least CFAF 95 million for the ETO 's operating costs (para 7.1-d). Evidence that&#13;
ONAMOE has transferred CFAF 95 million in 1996 to the ETO would be a condition ofproject&#13;
effectiveness (para 7. 2-c).. This would be equivalent to about 20% of ONMOE's annual revenues of&#13;
CFAF 450 million, generated by the "'employment services" tax (equivalent to 1% of payroll). In addition,&#13;
during negotiations the ONMOE gave assurances that it would furnish to IDA by May 31 of each year,&#13;
beginning in 1996, its Annual Activity and Budget Execution Report for the previous year (para 7. 1-d).&#13;
Sub-Component 3.1 -Establishment of Employment and Training Observatory (US$0.44&#13;
million)&#13;
3.31   The project would finance minor rehabilitation of offices at the ONMOE to permit the installation&#13;
of the ETO. Office equipment, furniture. computers, telephones, fax and mobylettes would also be&#13;
financed. The ETO would be staffed by six specialists: two economists (macro and micro), two&#13;
statisticians, one training specialist and one communications/IEC specialist. These individuals would&#13;
gather existing labor market information from other sources, oversee complementary labor market and&#13;
training surveys, analyze and synthesize data. and prepare dissemination materials in both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative formats. The ONMOE would no longer perform these functions and would eliminate its&#13;
Statistics and Information Division, restncting itself to job placement counseling, training, civil service&#13;
recruitment and special programs related to former public and parastatal employees and recent school&#13;
graduates who are currently unemployed. In December of each year an annual report of ETO activities&#13;
would be sent to IDA for review, including an evaluation of the vear's activities and the ETO work&#13;
program and budget for the upcoming year. Prior to negotiations the Govenmment submitted to IDA for&#13;
review the draft TORs for the ETO Director and all ETO technical personnel. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness the Government would transfer all designated staff to be redeployed to the Employment and&#13;
Training Observatory (para 7.2-d).&#13;
3.32   To support the ETO, a network and database would be developed of consultants and other resource&#13;
people for employment and training issues. This %vould include a wvide range of individuals and institutions&#13;
(local and intemational) which could supply, collect. analyze and/or use information relating to the labor&#13;
market and training. Partner institutions would include the National Department for Statistics and&#13;
Information (DNSI), the National Institute for Social Security (INPS), the National Department for&#13;
Planning, the National Federation of Employers. the National Federation of Artisans, the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce. the Chamber of Trades, the national unions and private placement services.&#13;
Sub-Component 3.2 - Training of ETO Staff (US$ 0.40 million)&#13;
3.33   The project would finance TA and staff development according to a seven-module program&#13;
developed in collaboration with the Intemational Labor Office (ILO). These modules would include: (a)&#13;
basic training in statistical analysis of labor markets and training programs for all ETO staff; (b) basic&#13;
training in use of computers and standard software, (c) advanced training in the use of computers for&#13;
statistical analysis of survev data for up to 14 ETO staff and other "network personnel"; (d) a training&#13;
seminar covering all qualitative labor market information and monitoring of VET trainees; (e) a workshop&#13;
for all ETO and DNETP personnel. including practical case studies, on the preparation and execution of&#13;
labor market surveys, the job repertoire, informal sector analysis, and the use of labor market information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
for programming of VET resources; (f) advanced training abroad for 3 high-level ETO staff in labor&#13;
market statistics and VET planning; and (g) a study tour for 2 ETO staff to examine employment&#13;
observatories in neighboring countries (e.g. Ivory Coast and Benin).&#13;
Sub-Component 3.3 -Surveys of Labor Market and Training (USSO.42 million)&#13;
3.34   Each year the project would finance a series of labor market and training surveys, including: (i) a&#13;
survey of employers' skill requirements, based on stratified sampling of modem and informal sector firns&#13;
in Bamako and the regions; (ii) tracer studies of recent VET and higher education graduates; and (iii) the&#13;
evolution and structure of the modem labor market. Recruitmnent and training of surveyors, development of&#13;
survey methodology, production of questionnaires and supplies for survey analysis would be financed.&#13;
Sub-Component 3.4 - Dissemination of Labor Market Information&#13;
(US$ 0.44 million)&#13;
3.35   The project would promote the dissemination of labor market information through strengthening of&#13;
the ETO Documentation Center, with audio-visual and computer equipment, subscriptions and relevant&#13;
reference materials. The ETO would publish on a periodic basis (not less than annual): (a) a report on&#13;
employment trends in both formal and informal sector, and their impact on VET services; (b) projections of&#13;
trades and occupations experiencing employment growth and the training streams which correspond to&#13;
them; (d) a policy brief for Governnent decision-makers, proposing steps to better adapt VET services; and&#13;
(e) simple, 1-2 page color brochures presenting labor market and training statistics in easy-to-understand&#13;
graphic form for wider audiences. Beyond printed materials, the Documentation Center would also&#13;
organize national and regional seminars for DNETP and VTSF personnel to present labor market trends&#13;
and their impact on VET services, and would conduct job counseling seminars and for secondary and&#13;
higher education students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. PROJECT COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
4.1    Total project costs are estimated at US$ 22.9 million, including taxes and duties, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$ 14.8 million (67%). Base costs are estimated at US$ 19.6 million (86%) and&#13;
total contingencies at US$ 3.3 million (14%). Price contingencies, estimated at US$ 2.0 million, assume an&#13;
annual domestic inflation rate of 4 % and a foreign inflation rate of 3 %. Physical contingencies, estimated&#13;
at US$ 1.3 million, are based on rates of 10% and 5% for goods and for services, respectively. Detailed&#13;
project costs and financing estimated are summarized in Annex 6.1.&#13;
4.2    The project would be financed by an IDA credit of US$ 13.4 million equivalent (59% of total&#13;
project costs), a grant from the FAC of US$ 3.7 million equivalent (16% of total costs), and contributions&#13;
from Government, employers and beneficiaries for an estimated US$ 5.8 million equivalent (24% of project&#13;
costs), including 100% of taxes and duties.&#13;

4.3    The cost estimates for training provided under Component 2 are based on an average of US$ 140&#13;
per person-month of training, calculated from a variety of existing skills upgrading programs in Mali.&#13;
Actual costs would vary considerably with the level of training required, the specialty involved, nature of&#13;
the training, the equipment and material required, the number of persons participating in the training&#13;
session, etc.&#13;
B.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
4.4    The project would be managed through two structures: a Component Coordination Unit (CCU) and&#13;
the Vocational Training Support Fund. The CCU would be responsible for project activities concerning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
pre-service VET (component 1) and the ETO (component 3), including management of project resources&#13;
and the preparation of financial statements for audit for these two components. It would be staffed by a&#13;
Coordinator (nominated by the MESSRS), two specialists in accounting and procurement, and a secretary,&#13;
and would be integrated at the Cabinet level of the MESSRS. Execution of pre-service VET activities&#13;
(component 1) would be the responsibility of the DNETP, while the Director of the ETO would be&#13;
responsible for execution of component 3 (under the oversight of the ONMOE, which is governed in&#13;
tripartite fashion by employers, unions and the Government). As for the VTSF, it would be managed by a&#13;
16-member Management Committee (12 from the private sector, 4 from the public sector), with daily&#13;
execution responsibilities delegated to an Executive Secretariat headed by a General Director, who would&#13;
be responsible for management of project resources pertaining to the VTSF and the preparation of VTSF&#13;
financial statements for audit. Its staff of eight professionals should be fully adequate for reviewing&#13;
training requests, procuring training providers and handling project finances. Prior to negotiations, the&#13;
Government submitted to IDA for review a draft inter-ministerial arrete to be signed by all ministers&#13;
concemed, which specifies the roles and responsibilities of all ministries involved in project execution, the&#13;
CCU, the VTSF, the DNETP and the ETO. The TORs for the Coordinator and technical support staff of&#13;
the CCU were submitted prior to negotiations. During negotiations the Government gave assurances that&#13;
the positions of CCU Coordinator and VTSF General Director would be maintained and staffed by&#13;
qualified personnel, acceptable at all times to IDA, (para 7. 1 -e). Prior to Board presentation, the&#13;
Government nominated the CCU Coordinator and General Director of the VTSF, acceptable to IDA. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, the Government will: (i) recruit qualified technical personnel acceptable to&#13;
IDA in adequate numbers to the CCUand VTSF(para 7.2-e); (ii) submit to IDA work programs for the&#13;
CCUand JISF, and a set ofproject implementanon benchmarks for the first year ofproject&#13;
implementation (para 7.2-fr; and (iii) provide evidence that the VTSF has been allocated appropriate&#13;
offices, acceptable to IDA (7. 2-g).&#13;
4.5    Following pre-appraisal, the Government Project Preparation Team prepared a Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP), which includes: an Operations Manual for the VTSF; the project's institutional&#13;
framework; specific responsibilities by executing agency; estimated activity and disbursement plans for the&#13;
project; terms of reference for all project personnel and short-term technical assistance to be financed under&#13;
the project; a procurement plan for the five years of the project, and the principal draft procurement&#13;
documents for the first year of project execution. The Operations Manual for the VTSF includes: (i)&#13;
definitions of beneficiaries, training sponsors and training providers; (ii) eligibility and evaluation criteria&#13;
for proposed training sub-projects; (iii) processing steps, including sample forms and documents; (iv)&#13;
selection criteria and standard forms for selection of trainers; (v) monitoring and evaluation procedures and&#13;
criteria; and (vi) administrative information governing VTSF personnel and other operations. The adoption&#13;
by the Government of the PIP, including the revisions agreed to during negotiations, would be a&#13;
condition of Credit effectiveness (para 7. 2-h). Meanwhile, the revision of all legal and administrative texts&#13;
concerning VET is well underway (the revised texts are scheduled to be introduced to the Council of&#13;
Ministers in early 1996), and the Government has begun preparation of first-year workprograms for the&#13;
three components, which would be incorporated into the final version of the PIP, as discussed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Project Procurement Arrangements, Management and Review&#13;
4.6    Procurement Arrangements: Table 4.2 below summarizes the project elements and their&#13;
estimated cost and proposed method of procurement. Procurement procedures under the project would be&#13;
undertaken as follows:&#13;
(a)    Works: The bulk of civil works consists of rehabilitation and extensions of five training&#13;
centers in Bamako, Sikasso, Kayes and San. In addition, offices would be constructed for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
the DNETP, and those for the VTSF and ETO would be renovated. All civil works (US$&#13;
1.5 million equivalent, including taxes and duties) would be delegated to AGETIPE,&#13;
through a legal agreement signed between the CCU and AGETIPE. AGETIPE would be&#13;
responsible for all bid preparation, evaluation, award and payments for contracts for&#13;
architectural services and civil works. AGETIPE would use NCB procedures satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, including local advertising, public bid opening, clarity in evaluation criteria and&#13;
award to the lowest evaluated bidder. Due to their small size and geographic spread, these&#13;
civil works contracts are unlikely to attract foreign bidders, although foreign bidders would&#13;
not be precluded from submitting bids. The average size of works are estimated at US$&#13;
92,000. Any contract above US$ 250,000 would go through ICB and require prior review&#13;
of the Bank before signature, although no such contract is expected.&#13;
(b)    Goods: Goods financed under the credit (US$ 4.5 million equivalent) include pedagogical&#13;
equipment for workshops and classrooms, didactic materials and tools, office equipment&#13;
and supplies, school and office furniture, and vehicles. Goods would be grouped into&#13;
packages of at least US$ 100,000 each and procured through ICB in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines and using Standard Bidding Documents developed by the&#13;
Bank. When ICB procedures are used, domestic manufacturers of goods would be allowed&#13;
a preference of 15 percent over the CIP price of competing foreign suppliers or the existing&#13;
applicable rate of import duties, whichever is lower, in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Contracts for equipment and furniture costing more than US$ 50,000 but less than US$&#13;
100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of NCB, up to an aggregate amount not&#13;
to exceed US$ 0.22 million, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. Small&#13;
quantities of goods such as office supplies, pedagogic equipment, consumable materials&#13;
and spare parts, which are normally available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into&#13;
packages of at least US$ 50,000 may be procured through prudent international shopping,&#13;
based on price quotations of at least three reliable suppliers, or through UNDP's Inter-&#13;
Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO), especially for office equipment and&#13;
vehicles, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.20 million equivalent. Goods estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$40,000, which are available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into&#13;
packages of at least US$50,000 may be procured through local shopping, based on price&#13;
quotations of at least three reliable suppliers, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.20&#13;
million. All bids would be submitted on CIP basis for imported goods and on an ex-&#13;
factory basis for locally manufactured goods.&#13;
(c)    Training: Labor force skills upgrading through the VTSF constitutes the bulk of the&#13;
Project, with a total estimated amount of US$ 6.3 million equivalent, and includes the&#13;
development and financing of in-service training and apprenticeship sub-projects, which&#13;
would be procured in accordance with the VTSF Operational Manual's procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. However, bidding would be permitted only to pre-qualified'&#13;
trainers, consulting firms and training institutions. The criteria for their pre-qualification&#13;
were finalized during appraisal - an initial list of pre-qualified training firms for the VTSF,&#13;
subdivided on the basis of areas of expertise, were submitted to IDA and discussed during&#13;
negotiations. Additional training services for the DNETP and ETO, for a total estimated&#13;
amount of US$ 0.9 million, would be selected in accordance with principles and&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981).&#13;
(d)    Consultancies: Specialists Services for technical assistance, studies and other services&#13;
(approximately 124 person-months, all short-term) for a total estimated amount of US$&#13;
1.2 million equivalent, would be selected in accordance with principles and procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
acceptable to IDA on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). For&#13;
complex, time-based assignments, consultants would be employed under contracts&#13;
acceptable to the IDA and prepared on the basis of the standard contracts for consultants'&#13;
services issued by the Bank. Draft terms of reference (TORs) for short-term international&#13;
technical assistance to be financed under the project were prepared during appraisal and&#13;
reviewed by IDA during negotiations.&#13;
(e)    Miscellaneous Contractual Services: Approximately 420 person-months of contractual&#13;
services would be selected (for a total estimated amount of US$ 1.1 million equivalent), for&#13;
the preparation and evaluation of VTSF training sub-projects, labor market studies,&#13;
promotional campaigns and audits. In addition, 20 project staff would be hired under&#13;
fixed-term contracts (for a total estimated amount of US$ 0.85 million equivalent). This&#13;
would include the CCU Coordinator, the VTSF General Director, two procurement and&#13;
three financial administration specialists, five training experts, an IEC specialist, three&#13;
secretaries, a driver, a maintenance man and two guards. Hiring procedures, work&#13;
contracts and salary levels are spelled out in the VTSF Operational Manual.&#13;
4.7    Procurement Management: The CCU would be responsible for handling procurement of&#13;
equipment, vehicles and consultants for components I and 3. It would be important to ensure that CCU&#13;
staff recruited have extensive experience in implementing World Bank projects, including participation in&#13;
Bank-sponsored training in procurement, disbursement and financial management. The use of the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents would be the norm. AGETIPE, the delegated agency for procurement of civil&#13;
works, is fully versed in Bank procurement procedures and is supervised by Bank staff on a regular basis.&#13;
Moreover, a standard contract for AGETIPE's services has been elaborated, approved by the Bank and is&#13;
used routinely in on-going projects. As for the VTSF, staff recruited to handle procurement of training&#13;
services and consultants would have previous procurement experience and would participate in&#13;
procurement training as part of the project launch seminar. Furthermore, the VTSF's Operational Manual&#13;
procedures for training follow the Bank's guidelines for services and would be used for all training&#13;
contracts.&#13;

4.8    Procurement Review: For Components 1 and 3, contracts awarded for IDA-financed works&#13;
above US$ 250,000 and for goods above US$ 100,000, would be subject to IDA's prior review. In&#13;
particular, the CCU-AGETIPE contract would be reviewed and approved by IDA before signature. The&#13;
prior review process would cover 80 % of the total value of the amount contracted for goods. Selective&#13;
post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold level would be carried out, for about one in five&#13;
contracts, during project supervision. Prior review and/or approval by IDA for consultants contracts&#13;
would include budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports&#13;
and contracts. IDA prior review would not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and&#13;
individuals estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 and US$ 50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the&#13;
exception to IDA prior review would not apply to the terms of reference for contracts, regardless of value,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
to single source hiring, to assignments of critical nature as determined by IDA, and to amendments raising&#13;
the contract value above the prior review threshold.&#13;
4.9    For Component 2, the VTSF training contracts in excess of US$50,000 and all sole source&#13;
contracts would be subject to prior review by IDA. In order to enhance the supply of labor force training&#13;
at a competitive cost, the VTSF would prompt and invite applications of local and foreign training firms to&#13;
be included in a list of pre-qualified training providers based on their previous experience, qualifications&#13;
and specialties. The list, which would be subject to prior review by IDA, would be regularly updated and&#13;
subdivided on the basis of areas of expertise. After IDA has given its no-objection to the list, the VTSF&#13;
would establish shortlists of three or four firms for each of the specialties and proceed, with no further&#13;
approval by IDA, to the award to contracts on the basis of (a) TORs, letters of invitation and standard&#13;
contracts previously agreed with IDA and (b) evaluation of proposals based on economic, pedagogic and&#13;
financial criteria, as defined in the letters of invitation.&#13;
4.10 Procurement information would be collected and recorded by the CCU and the VTSF General&#13;
Director on a quarterly basis and transmitted to IDA. Quarterly reports would include: (i) revised cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts; (ii) timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award and completion time for individual contracts, and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on&#13;
specified methods of procurement. During supervision missions, a detailed statement of all procurement&#13;
undertaken to date, together with a forecast of procurement actions and estimated disbursements to be&#13;
undertaken in the coming year, would be provided to IDA.&#13;
Project Disbursements&#13;
4.11   The project is expected to be completed over a 5-year period with IDA credits disbursed over six&#13;
years according to the categories shown in Table 4.5. The estimated disbursement profile is shown in&#13;
Annex 6.2. Disbursement from the IDA Credit would be fully documented. However, the Borrower&#13;
would be permitted to submit withdrawal applications on the basis of certified SOEs for contracts of less&#13;
than US$ 100,000 equivalent for goods and consultant firms, US$ 250,000 equivalent for works, and US$&#13;
50,000 equivalent for individual consultants. For training programs, the Vocational Training Support Fund&#13;
(VTSF) would establish financing conventions with the training providers specifying the purpose,&#13;
beneficiaries, expected outcomes, monitoring responsibilities and costs estimates. Contracts would be&#13;
signed between the VTSF and the training providers consistent with Bank guidelines and procedures,&#13;
specifying the responsibilities, monitoring and evaluation procedures, disbursement conditions and&#13;
schedule. Disbursements would be made by the VTSF on this basis, and final payment granted following&#13;
positive evaluation and the clearance of both the training sponsor and the VTSF. Disbursements against&#13;
eligible expenditures would be audited semi-annually. Documents for withdrawals under SOEs would be&#13;
retained by the executing agencies for review by IDA supervision missions and for project auditors.&#13;
Withdrawal applications would be approved and accounted for by the VTSF.&#13;

Upon credit effectiveness IDA would make initial deposits of US$ 500,000 equivalent for each account,&#13;
equivalent to four months of estimated project expenditures. Later, if project execution and disbursements&#13;
so justify, the special accounts would be topped out to US$ 750,000. IDA would replenish the accounts&#13;
upon receipt of appropriate documentation satisfactory to IDA for incurred eligible expenditures.&#13;
Replenishment requests would be made by the VTSF General Director for Special Account (A) and by the&#13;
CCU Coordinator for Special Account (B), accompanied by supporting Special Account statements and&#13;
reconciliations. Applications for direct payments or reimbursement would apply to contracts above&#13;

4.13   Government, employer and beneficiary counterpart funding for the project would be provided&#13;
through various channels. For civil works and furniture counterpart funding, the Government would&#13;
allocate through the Budget Special dInvestissement (BSI) at least CFAF 40 million in 1996 and at least&#13;
CFAF 110 million in 1997. For financing of VTSF training activities, the Government would transfer to&#13;
the VTSF earmarked revenues from the Vocational Training Tax paid by employers (estimated at CFAF&#13;
300 million per year). For financing of the ETO, the Government would ensure the transfer by the&#13;
ONMOE of at least CFAF 95 million per year, from revenues generated by the 1 % "employment services"&#13;
tax paid by employers. Finally, beneficiaries would make their 25% contribution to VTSF-financed&#13;
training activities directly to the VTSF, and these contributions would be verified and subject to audit.&#13;
During negotiations Government gave assurances that it would provide necessary counterpart funding&#13;
through the BSIfor civil works andfurniture (para 7.1 -.J). Draft statutes for the introduction of a&#13;
Vocational Training Tax, accompanied by draft statutes for the reduction of other payroll taxes were&#13;
submitted to IDA prior to negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
Project Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
4.14   Project accounts would be maintained by the CCU and VTSF in accordance with International&#13;
Accounting Standards. The CCU and VTSF would maintain separate special and subsidiary accounts to&#13;
reflect their operations, with each submitting and accounting for their own credit withdrawal applications.&#13;
Each agency would be responsible for preparation of their annual financial statements and both sets of&#13;
accounts would be audited annually, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the CCU and VTSF&#13;
would submit audit reports and auditedfinancial statements of reasonable scope and detail within six&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year (para 7.1-g). SOEs would be subject to a documentary verification&#13;
by a local accounting firm in association with the external auditor before their submission to IDA for&#13;
reimbursement. The external auditors would be appointed on an annual basis, with the contract renewed as&#13;
necessary, until notice to the contrary is given by the project. The terms of reference of the consultants to&#13;
be recruited to establish the accounting and financial management system for the VTSF, and the terms of&#13;
reference, the shortlist of firms and the selection procedures for audit contracts were submitted to IDA&#13;
prior to negotiations. As conditions for effectiveness, the Government agreed to submit proof that: (i) an&#13;
external auditor has been appointed, acceptable to IDA, to conduct annual audits of both the CCU and&#13;
the VTSF, and of the project accounts; and (ii) the financial administration and accounting systems of&#13;
both the CCU and VTSF are fully operational, as certified by the appointed external auditor (para 7.2-i).&#13;
Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.15   Monitoring and evaluation of project performance would be carried out by the CCU and VTSF,&#13;
both of which would establish project monitoring procedures (including MIS) to track project&#13;
implementation relative to project performance indicators (see Annex 6.4), which include both process and&#13;
impact evaluation criteria. An annual program review would assess project performance against these&#13;
benchmark indicators, and corrective actions would be taken as required. In addition, a mid-tern review&#13;
would be undertaken to make an in-depth analysis of the efficiency of training activities and of their impact&#13;
on beneficiaries. The evaluation criteria for the mid-term review were established and agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations. During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the CCUand VTSFwould:&#13;
(i) transmit semesterly project implementation progress reports to IDA; (ii) submit annual work&#13;
programs and budgets no later than January 31 of each year; (iii) organize and carry out with IDA&#13;
during the fourth quarter of each calendar year a review ofprogress in project implementation; (iv)&#13;
carry out with IDA a mid-term review ofproject implementation progress no later than December 1998&#13;
(para 7. 1-g). Based on the review, the CCU, VTSF and executing agencies (DNETP and ETO) would&#13;
prepare and implement an action plan, acceptable to IDA, for further implementation of project activities.&#13;
Details of the Bank's supervision plan and annual and mid-term reviews are provided in Annex 6.4 Within&#13;
six months after the closing of the Credit, the CCU and VTSF would transmit to IDA a joint&#13;
Implementation Completion Report, prepared in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para 7. I -g).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.1    Project appraisal included a full-scale economic analysis of the proposed project. (See Annex 2.1&#13;
for the full report). This analysis included 8 dimensions: (a) the placement of the project in the larger&#13;
macro-economic context, considering the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Mali and future growth&#13;
trends: (b) qualitative and quantitative results from employer and manpower surveys; (c) calculations of&#13;
the rate of return to vocational education and training services, based on unit costs, wages and probability&#13;
of employment by training stream, and sensitivity analyses of these rate of return calculations to determine&#13;
key variables for scrutiny during implementation; (d) the development of a least-cost alternative for VET&#13;
investments; (e) fiscal impact analysis, which examines the recurrent cost impact of proposed project&#13;
investments and compares this to current spending levels, and addresses cost-recovery issues; (f)&#13;
institutional analysis, which assesses the capacity of the National Department for Technical and Vocational&#13;
Training, the Vocational Training Support Fund and the Employment and Training Observatory to&#13;
implement this project; (g) poverty analysis, which specifies which benefits would go to the poor and&#13;
examines the project's impact on beneficiaries' incomes; and finally (h) the identification of economic&#13;
performance indicators for monitoring and feedback during implementation (for indicators see Annex 6.4).&#13;
Viewed together, the economic analysis of the Mali VET Consolidation Project permits a positive overall&#13;
assessment and argues for the project's financing.&#13;
5.2    As mentioned in Chapter 1, Mali's macroeconomic performance and expected growth augur well&#13;
for the project, which is fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. Labor market&#13;
demand for technical and vocational skills (also discussed in Chapter 1) is expected to grow principally in&#13;
textiles, agro-industry, simple import substitution, construction, public works, transport, hotels and&#13;
tourism, crafts, and small and medium enterprises. Similar conclusions regarding promising economic sub-&#13;
sectors were reached in the World Bank's 1994 Private Sector Assessment for Mali. This will require&#13;
technically qualified specialists in maintenance, mechanics (general, auto and truck), metalwork, electricity,&#13;
construction and accounting/management.&#13;
5.3    Economic rates of return (both private and social) to 2- and 4-year vocational education and&#13;
training were calculated, overall and by training stream. (Note: the economic rate of return is the rate of&#13;
interest that equates the discounted present value of expected benefits and the present value of costs. The&#13;
private rate of return measures the relationship between the costs and benefits of education for the&#13;
individual, and the social rate of return measures the relationship between all the social costs of training&#13;
that must be bome by society as a whole, and the benefits that are expected to accrue to society.) These&#13;
rates are relative to 9 years of basic education leading to the Basic Education Diploma (the prerequisite for&#13;
entry into formal VET training institutions), and were calculated using data from the Annual Manpower&#13;
Surveys regarding salaries by education and training levels, unit cost information by training stream, and&#13;
hypotheses with respect to the probability of VET trainees obtaining jobs in their field, derived in part from&#13;
the VET tracer study discussed above. For 2-year VET, the private and social rates of return are estimated&#13;
at 27% and 13%, respectively. For 4-year VET, the private and social rates of return are estimated at 33%&#13;
and 21%, respectively. Note that these calculations are based on wages in the modern sector and so may&#13;
overestimate average trainee eamings. On the other hand, quite conservative estimates were used with&#13;
respect to the probability of employment (a maximum of 75% three years after graduation), and extemal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
benefits to training such as technological innovations, social cohesion, better health, reduced fertility,&#13;
intergenerational benefits, etc. were not calculated into the social rate of retum.&#13;
5.4    Sensitivity analysis suggests that to achieve at least a 10% social rate of return among CAP&#13;
trainees overall, at least 70% need to find ajob within three years of graduation, which pays at least&#13;
60,000 FCFA per month (about US$110). For BT trainees overall, at least 75% need to be employed&#13;
within three years of graduation, and eaming at least 90,000 FCFA per month (about US$180). (See&#13;
Annex 2.1 for sensitivity analyses of individual training streams.) This seems quite plausible given current&#13;
employment and salary trends. For example, in 1993, average monthly eamings for CAP-level modem&#13;
sector workers were CFAF 61,475, while those for BT-level employees were CFAF 114,500 (see Annex&#13;
2.2 for trends in monthly salaries by economic sector and training level). These average salary levels have&#13;
increased an estimated 15% since the devaluation of the CFAF in 1994.&#13;
5.5    For in-service training, a rate of return was calculated using estimates of unit costs and of trainee&#13;
salaries before and after training. Assuming a unit cost of US$ 140 per month of training (the figure used&#13;
in the Project Cost Tables), a US$ 10 increase in monthly earnings 12 months after training, and a slight&#13;
increase in the probability of being employed after training, the social rate of return to VTSF training&#13;
activities would be 34%. To achieve a minimum 10% rate of retum, trainees would have to be at least as&#13;
likely to be employed after the training as before, and would have to be eaming at least US$ 7 more per&#13;
month after the training. Assuming the training financed meets certain economic, financial and pedagogic&#13;
criteria, this minimum rate of return appears likely to be achieved.&#13;
5.6    A least-cost altemative approach was used during project appraisal, which attempted to reduce&#13;
VET unit costs through the design of multi-use, full-time training facilities which can be shared between&#13;
CAP and BT training institutions. An in-depth needs assessment, based on an extensive inventory of&#13;
existing training equipment, coupled with continued labor market demand and training supply analysis,&#13;
ensured that the project would only finance essential training equipment. The result of this approach was&#13;
to reduce final estimates for civil works and equipment required for consolidating pre-service VET services&#13;
from US$ 6.2 million (pre-appraisal) to US$ 3.8 million (appraisal).&#13;
5.7    Additional recurrent costs linked to investments in pre-service VET are estimated in nominal tenns&#13;
at CFAF 150 million, beginning in 1998, primarily for equipment maintenance, repairs and raw materials.&#13;
Relative to 1995 expenditures, this would be equivalent to an increase in real terms of 9% for pre-service&#13;
VET materials, of 4% in total VET expenditures, or 0.5% in total education spending. During&#13;
negotiations Government provided assurance that as of 1998 it would increase educational materials&#13;
financing to CFAF 60, 000 per VET student, and maintain this as a minimum for the duration ofproject&#13;
implementation (para 7. 1-h); this increase should be covered primarily by reducing scholarship&#13;
expenditures, although some additional resources may be required. Total VET unit costs (both investment&#13;
and recurrent) would increase to about US$750 per year, equivalent to approxinately two times general&#13;
secondary unit costs. This 2:1 ratio of VET to general secondary unit costs conforms to international&#13;
norms and reflects the added costs for equipment, materials, practical training and smaller classes.&#13;
5.8    For the first time in Mali, employer contributions and beneficiary cost recovery for in-service VET&#13;
services would be institutionalized. Employers would contribute approximately CFAF 300 million per year&#13;
to the Vocational Training Support Fund, through the 0.5% payroll tax for vocational training, Training&#13;
beneficiaries (or their employers or sponsors) would also pay 25% of the cost of VTSF-financed training&#13;
(10% for young apprentices). As for pre-service VET, while the economic rationale for increased cost-&#13;
recovery is apparent, this issue needs to be addressed for the sector as a whole, particularly at the higher&#13;
education level, before it can be introduced in the context of this project (the recently-identified Education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
SIP will address this issue). In addition, employers and workers would contribute CFAF 95 million each&#13;
year for financing of 100% of the estimated operating costs of the ETO and mobilized through the 1%&#13;
employment services tax.&#13;
5.9    The proposed project would primarily address skill deficiencies among urban workers, a large&#13;
proportion of whom are poor, working in the informal sector, with little general or vocational education and&#13;
training. Under the project, through the Vocational Training Support Fund, approximately 8,000 workers&#13;
and apprentices would benefit from one month of in-service training each year for five years, with relatively&#13;
poor informal sector workers and apprentices constituting approximately 50% of all beneficiaries. In other&#13;
words, the project would provide approximately 20,000 poor workers with skills upgrading. These workers&#13;
should demonstrate improved vocational and entrepreneurial skills, thereby improving productivity, labor&#13;
mobility, employment prospects, and earnings.&#13;
5.10   Women, in particular, have very low levels of literacy, basic education and training, and very little&#13;
access to training opportunities. On the other hand, they represent a large share of workers in the informal&#13;
sector, engaged in agro-processing, dressmaking, soapmaking, dyeing, commerce, and other trades. The&#13;
proposed project would reach out and support the training of female workers in small and micro-&#13;
enterprises, in both formal and informal sectors, and would provide women with greater opportunities to&#13;
enhance their skills, productivity and earnings. To ensure this, the VTSF would recruit a women's training&#13;
specialist (see para 3.24), and set a target of 40% female participation in VTSF-financed activities.&#13;
5.11   The preceding analysis suggests a series of project performance indicators which should be&#13;
monitored and evaluated during project supervision, the mid-term review and upon project completion.&#13;
Please refer to Annex 6.4 for the table of proposed indicators.&#13;
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    PRoJEcT BENEFITS&#13;
6.1    The first benefit would be economic. As discussed above, approximately 8,000 workers and&#13;
apprentices would benefit from one month of in-service training each year for five years, plus another&#13;
1,200 pre-service VET students per year for five years. VET trainees should demonstrate improved&#13;
vocational and entrepreneurial skills, thereby improving productivity, labor mobility, employment&#13;
prospects, and economic growth. The second benefit would be institutional. The project would strengthen&#13;
the key strategic functions of the DNETP, and put in place efficient procedures for the allocation and use of&#13;
public funds for both pre-service VET and skills upgrading. Government would be better able to&#13;
administer the VET system, while stimulating the provision of training through the private sector. Direct&#13;
involvement of employers in management of both pre-service and in-service VET training would improve&#13;
the system's responsiveness to demand in the labor market. The third benefit would be social. By targeting&#13;
the training and development needs of youth and workers outside of the formal education and training&#13;
system, with a special effort aimed at women, the project would increase the productivity of the poor's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
principal asset, labor. This would improve equity, reduce social tensions linked to unemployment,&#13;
contribute to the alleviation of urban poverty.&#13;
B.    PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.2    The greatest risk to this project is the possibility that growth of the economy and of labor market&#13;
demand for the skills to be developed under the project will be insufficient. While current economic&#13;
indicators provide grounds for optimism, Mali's economy is extremely vulnerable to changes in climate and&#13;
externally-defined commodity prices. Quite frankly, there is little the proposed project can do to minimize&#13;
this risk, except to diversify training activities to cover a range of economic sectors - slow growth in one&#13;
sector may be offset by rapid growth in another, and so overall project performance would be satisfactory.&#13;
The second risk is political and social pressure arising from increased numbers of basic education&#13;
graduates, which hinders the control of VET enrollment growth and the Government's ability to reduce&#13;
and/or phase out training streams no longer demanded in the labor market. This is being addressed&#13;
through: revised, transparent admissions policies being applied for the school year 1995-1996; a clear&#13;
definition of what constitutes VET's enrollment capacity; and the Government's ongoing public&#13;
communications program linked to execution of the Education SECAL. The third risk is resistance within&#13;
the MESSRS to execute curricula reforms, and to involve employers in VET management. This is being&#13;
addressed by an ongoing, participatory training program for VET administrators and teachers which covers&#13;
labor market demand, curriculum requirements, teacher training, and school management. The fourth risk&#13;
is weak implementation capacity and delays in project start-up, which are being addressed through a&#13;
Project Preparation Facility to finance the recruitment and training of project staff, the installation and&#13;
training for both financial and project implementation monitoring systems, the pilot testing of a range of&#13;
training sub-projects under the VTSF, the development of in-service training curricula, promotional&#13;
activities to inform targeted groups about the project, advance preparation of procurement documents and a&#13;
project launch seminar. Finallv, employers may not be willing to play an active role in managing either&#13;
pre-service or in-service VET. This risk has been minimized through private sector involvement in the&#13;
preparation and design of this project, in particular with respect to the Vocational Training Support Fund&#13;
(the private sector would assume the presidency of the VTSF Management Committee).&#13;
6.3    Environment. The project is not expected to pose any environmental risks nor have any&#13;
significant environmental impact and is proposed for Category C.&#13;
7. CONDITIONS, AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    During negotiations, Government gave assurances that:&#13;
(a)    At all times during project implementation, the Government would limit the enrollment in&#13;
VET institutions to a level compatible with the capacity of practical training facilities,&#13;
which is based on the number of functional work stations for each training stream (para.&#13;
2.25);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;

To:           Mr. James D. Wolfensohn&#13;
President, The World Bank&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
USA&#13;
The purpose of this letter on training and employment policy is to express the desire of the Government&#13;
of Mali both to proceed with a thorough reforrn of its system of technical education and vocational training and to&#13;
improve the productivity of enterprises and artisans, as well as data collection related to employment. To this&#13;
end, the Govemrnment intends to:&#13;
re-establish the quality of pre-service vocational training;&#13;
transform vocational training and technical education facilities into true service centers dedicated to both&#13;
pre-service and in-service training;&#13;
*      improve the relevance of training to employrnent from both the quantitative and qualitative points of&#13;
view;&#13;
*      correct the imbalance in the supply of training from both the geographic and sectoral points of view;&#13;
promote private sector participation in the financing and management of vocational training;&#13;
*      improve apprenticeship training in the informal sector;&#13;
develop in-service training for employees of enterprises;&#13;
*      improve mechanisms for assessing the labor market;&#13;
the student flow in accordance with the absorptive capacity of specific training streams;&#13;
eliminate obsolete training streams;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
*      increase the management autonomy of technical education and vocational training institutions;&#13;
*      provide increased recurrent cost financing for the purchase and maintenance of equipment and material.&#13;
As it exists today, vocational training is not sufficiently focused on labor market demand, resuling in a&#13;
significant disparity between employers' expectations and the ability of the training system to meet such&#13;
expectations. Vocational training and technical education are primarily oriented toward the tertiary sector and&#13;
need to be re-oriented toward basic occupations of strategic importance to the economic development of our&#13;
country.&#13;
A shift in the focus of vocational training thus appears necessary, in order to better respond to the diverse&#13;
needs and cienteles that such training is designed to serve.&#13;
Reform in this area cannot be implemented and supported unless certain conditions are satisfied. We&#13;
also agree that these conditions must not be considered as separate factors, but rather as integral components of a&#13;
comprehensive strategy for change. In our judgment, these conditions include:&#13;
A greater understanding of needs, which requires:&#13;
*      an up-to-date frame of reference on occupations and jobs;&#13;
*      the capacity to gather and maintain data on enterprises and employment generating sectors;&#13;
*      a minimum of knowledge on the approximate number of jobs in different categories of trades,&#13;
occupations and activities, as well as their geographic breakdown;&#13;
*      the ability to adapt to the environment;&#13;
*      the ability to monitor and anticipate technological trends affecting certain types of trades and&#13;
occupations.&#13;
'Training programs that meet labor market demand, which requires:&#13;
*      orienting programs toward skills development;&#13;
*      the capacity to adjust these programs on a regular basis in accordance with employment trends;&#13;
ensuring that these programs remain flexible so that they can be adapted to the specific needs of&#13;
the various cienteles.&#13;
Competent teachers and training staff, which requires:&#13;
up-to-date information on existing personnel;&#13;
defining criteria for hiring staff to be recruited in the future;&#13;
ensuring the pedagogical monitoring of trainers;&#13;
establishing appropriate training plans;&#13;
organizing study courses for trainers both within Malian enterprises and abroad.&#13;
Implementation of a training plan that is appropriate to the requirements of training programs and the&#13;
manpower to be trained, which requires:&#13;
*      qualitative and quantitative knowledge of labor market demand;&#13;
*      knowledge of program requirements in terms of basic equipment, accessories and tools, raw&#13;
materials and, finally, space;&#13;
the financial capacity to support implementation of this plan.&#13;
Development of standards for financing vocational training, which requires:&#13;
*      Knowledge of costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
full command of equipment and machinery renewal flows, as weUl as raw material consumpon&#13;
rates;&#13;
knowledge of the requirements of related programs, in order to share certain equipment or&#13;
machinery,&#13;
knowledge of the rate of use of each type of equipment or nachine by each target group.&#13;
Adjustment of enrollment to absorptive capacity, which requires:&#13;
*      knowledge of the actual absorptive capacity of training facilities, including the number of&#13;
available work stations and rates of use;&#13;
*      regulation of student inflows and outflows.&#13;
Development of standards for evaluating skills, which requires:&#13;
*      the availability of skills-based programs consistent with the requiremets of the labor market;&#13;
*      knowledge of the skills evaluation approach.&#13;
Monitoring student performance and progress, which requires:&#13;
setting up a computerized information system on students;&#13;
*      transmitting and compiling results for the purpose of monitoring, certification and statistics.&#13;
Monitoring the entry of graduates into the labor market, which requires:&#13;
*      setting up a centralized file of graduates of public and private schools;&#13;
*      conducting follow-up surveys of graduates in the labor force.&#13;
,Adequate financing to cover the recurrent costs of vocational training, which requires:&#13;
*       ithat long-term financing be available;&#13;
*      that objective criteria be established for allocating resources;&#13;
*      that the system display the necessary flexibility and transparency;&#13;
*      that the mechanisms set in place ensure partial cost recovery.&#13;
The desire of public and private partners to act in synergy to generate the capacity for constant change&#13;
and adaptation, which requires:&#13;
that the roles and responsibilities of the various partners be redefined;&#13;
*      that mechanisms be identified to seek out and share information on the labor market;&#13;
*      that the private sector be involved in:&#13;
defining needs;&#13;
*      designing the content of programs;&#13;
*      managing training centers;&#13;
financing vocational training;&#13;
*      evaluating future graduates&#13;
* assessing the quality and relevance of available training;&#13;
*      absorbing trainees, both trainers and students.&#13;
Consolidation of pre-service vocational training: measures to be taken.&#13;
No country can aspire to sustainable development in the absence of an adequately trained labor fbrce that&#13;
is capable of adapting to the increasingly frequent changes that must be constandy confronted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
Aware of this reality and of the shortcomings that have been identified, the Government intends to adopt&#13;
a series of measures to ensure a lasting recovery.&#13;
Measure 1&#13;
All of the measures that the Government intends to adopt in order to rehabilitate vocational training and&#13;
technical education depend on prior revision of the legal and regulatory texts governing this type of activity.&#13;
Accordingly, all texts pertaining to vocational training and technical education will be reviewed and&#13;
revised in order to ensure their conformity to the new orientation envisioned by the Government, which entails:&#13;
*      greater decentralization of budgets and responsibilities, thereby enabling institutions to play a more&#13;
active role in the community;&#13;
*      administrative and pedagogical guidance in order to better serve the targeted client, i.e. the student;&#13;
the capacity to regenerate the system and manage change effectively.&#13;
Measure 2&#13;
Vocational training and technical education curricula, as they exist today, do not provide students with&#13;
the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for smooth integration into the labor market and subsequent progress&#13;
within a trade or profession.&#13;
A new framework for designing curricula, based on the principle of skills development, will therefore be&#13;
adopted in order to ensure that all new curricula designed in the future reflect this approach. Such curricula will&#13;
be broken down into modules and will regularly be brought up-to-date in line with trends affecting the trades and&#13;
professions for which students are being prepared. They will be sufficiently flexible to be adapted to pre-service&#13;
training, as well as to the upgrading of skills and retraining of the labor force.&#13;
The private sector will be closely involved in defining training needs, designing program content and&#13;
evaluating the quality and relevance of training activities.&#13;
During the period from 1996 to 2001, it is anticipated that curricula will be revised on the basis of ten&#13;
selected training streams: auto mechanics, metalwork, electrical mechanics, carpentry, woodworking, electricity&#13;
in the building trade, maintenance mechanics, office skills, masonry and plumbing.&#13;
Measure 3&#13;
The current supply of technical education and vocational training is concentrated almost exclusively in&#13;
the capital. The physical facilities are inadequate and poorly adapted to program requirements, particularly with&#13;
respect to the new curricula to be introduced. The new curricula have specific requirements in ternns of space and&#13;
the layout of machinery and equipment.&#13;
Accordingly, the Government proposes to rehabilitate a certain number of existing facilities and&#13;
construct other, new facilities. Two institutions in Bamako, the Secondary School for Business, Industry and&#13;
Administration (ECICA) and the Vocational Training Center (CFP), would be affected. A Vocational Training&#13;
Institute (IFP) would be developed or converted in each of the cities of Sikasso, San and Kayes.&#13;
Construction should begin in the second half of 1996 and be completed by the end of 1997.&#13;
Measure 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
The low level of professionalization of teachers and the absence of measures to upgrade their skills have&#13;
been noted in studies conducted on technical education and vocational training in Mali. The Ministry of&#13;
Secondary and Higher Education and of Scientific Research (MESSRS), which is responsible for technical&#13;
education and vocational training, intends to correct this situation, which pertains to both the pedagogical and&#13;
technical skills of active teachers, by setting new requirements for recruitment of future teachers.&#13;
The implementation of new training curricula, the creation of Enterprise Support and Training Units&#13;
(UFAEs) and better personnel management will make it possible to improve the average student-teacher ratio by&#13;
raising it from 14 to 20 midway through the project.&#13;
It is anticipated that each teacher of vocational training who will be involved in any of the programs&#13;
affected by the project will participate in intensive skills development activities and receive technical pedagogical&#13;
support during the period when the new programs are introduced.&#13;
Measure 5&#13;
Greater management autonomy for institutions requires that managers increase their capacity to manage&#13;
budgets, as well as the material and pedagogical aspects of training.&#13;
Skills development and training sessions, as well as study courses abroad, will be provided for directors&#13;
of institutions, program directors and inspectors. The emphasis will be on skills-based training methods,&#13;
preparation and supervision of teachers, administrative and pedagogical management and opening institutions to&#13;
the surrounding environment and to enterprises.&#13;
Measure 6&#13;
Developing the institutional capacity of the National Department of Technical Education and Vocational&#13;
Training (DNETP) is one of the major goals of our efforts to restructure vocational training. Thus, the DNETP&#13;
will be called upon to undertake a series of measures that relate to various aspects of the reform:&#13;
*       ldevelopment of curricula and instructional aids;&#13;
analysis of the impact of introducing new curricula;&#13;
rehabilitation of existing space and addition of new space;&#13;
linkages between the DNETP and its network of institutions;&#13;
*      linkages between the DNETP and the Employment and Training Observatory;&#13;
linkages between apprenticeship training and pre-service vocational training;&#13;
*      evaluating and approving courses of study;&#13;
*      establishment of an information system on clienteles and student monitoring;&#13;
responsibility for organizing teacher training and skills development.&#13;
Insofar as tie National Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training is at the very center&#13;
of the reform that we seek to introduce, it is critical that it be provided with appropriate physical facilities and&#13;
equipment. It is therefore anticipated that a separate building, capable of accommodating the entire DNETP&#13;
staff, will be built.&#13;
Computer equipment will facilitate the work of managers and support staff and will improve the&#13;
efficiency of their work. Such equipment will contribute not only to the administrative and financial management&#13;
of the DNETP but also to project management and to data collection on institutions and students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
Technical assistance, study courses abroad and computer equipment will all serve to strengthen the&#13;
institutional capacity of the DNETP.&#13;
Measure 7&#13;
Because vocational training must respond to labor market demand, the Ministry of Secondary and&#13;
Higher Education and of Scientific Research agrees to exert tight control over student flows in accordance with&#13;
the absorptive capacity of training facilities, not only for students in public institutions of vocational training but&#13;
also students in private institutions.&#13;
Measure 8&#13;
Training streams no longer consistent with government needs that lead to a professional technician&#13;
diploma (BT) will be reduced and restructured in order to make training more appropriate to employment&#13;
(customs, finance, labor).&#13;
Measure 9&#13;
Vocational training of quality is expensive. It is not enough to secure financing for the initial costs of&#13;
constructing buildings and purchasing equipment on a one-time basis. It is also necessary to anticipate and&#13;
provide for the recurrent costs associated with the purchase of raw materials, as well as equipment maintance&#13;
and renewal.&#13;
Aware of the importance of developing vocational training of quality, the Government is prepared to&#13;
make additional efforts to assume its share of the recurrent costs required for skills- based vocational training.&#13;
Beginning in 1998, the Government will increase the funds allocated for reparative materials and&#13;
equipment used in technical education and vocational training. The amount per student will rise from CFAF&#13;
50,000 to CFAF 60,000 and will then remain at this level throughout the life of the project.&#13;
The Government agrees to provide counterpart funds for civil works and the purchase of furnire,&#13;
amounting to CFAF 40 millionin 1996 and CFAF   10 millionin 1997.&#13;
The Government also intends to develop mechanisms designed to open the tra;ning centers to the&#13;
surrounding environment and enterprises, in order to increase the number of funding sources and ensure that the&#13;
social contract covers not only pre-service vocational training but also in-service training and apprenticeships.&#13;
Setting up Enterprise Support and Training Units (UFAEs) within training institutions is an effective&#13;
way to bring schools and enterprises closer together. The units' role will be to offer services to enterprises,&#13;
particularly in the areas of training needs assessment, the development and implementation of individualized&#13;
training programs and technical support for enterprises.&#13;
Measure 10&#13;
The development of entrepreneurial capacity can play an important role in furthering the economic&#13;
development of our country. We must therefore estimate the interest of both youth and adults in going into&#13;
business and must facilitate their path by integrating into each of the new curricula a module on the&#13;
entrepreneurial opportunities of a given trade and the necessary steps to be taken in order to become an&#13;
entrepreneur.&#13;
Measure 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
It appears that the areas of food processing and mining will play an important role in the future of the&#13;
Malian economy. To avoid a situation of embarking on training programs that are inconsistent with the needs of&#13;
enterprises, the Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education and of Scientific Research plans to carry out two&#13;
complementary studies, with the objective of identifying:&#13;
windows of employment opportunity in each of the areas;&#13;
*      specific tasks for which enterprises are seeking particular skills;&#13;
*      the order of magnitude of recurrent labor requirements associated with the specific tasks that are&#13;
identified.&#13;
Reinvigoration of in-service vocational training and apprenticeship training: measures to be taken.&#13;
Aware of the fact that there is no coherent national policy on vocational training and that the absence of&#13;
such a policy affects the competitiveness of enterprises and the quality of services provided by artisans, the&#13;
Government has decided to establish a Vocational and Apprenticeship Training Support Fund (VTSF) in&#13;
collaboration with its extemal and local partners.&#13;
This fund will serve to ensure that the supply of training is consistent with the needs for skilled staff&#13;
expressed by various sectors of the economy and will have the followving objectives:&#13;
*      to develop and implement an appropriate national policy on vocational training;&#13;
*      to finance training activities;&#13;
*      to contribute to strengthening the infrastructure of training institutions.&#13;
The fund will thus play a role in financing training activities, as well as equipment for training&#13;
institutions, the flow of information to all parties involved in vocational training and, lastly, assistance and advice&#13;
for sponsors, trainers and the beneficiaries of vocational training.&#13;
Support for training in formal sector enterprises will embrace the following objectives:&#13;
*      to improve worker skills and thus the performance and competitiveness of enterprises;&#13;
to involve them in apprenticeship training.&#13;
Particular attention will be given to enterprises in the artisanal sector and micro-enterprises in the&#13;
informal sector. The objectives of training activities in these sectors will be to promote increased production and&#13;
improvements in quality, productivity and financial position.&#13;
The support to be provided w ill consist of&#13;
*      multiple short-term training, conducted in specialized centers or pre-service vocational training centers;&#13;
*      practical training in the field, i.e. in workshops or wNithin enterprises.&#13;
The VTSF will support those actively involved in the economic life of rural areas in order to improve&#13;
their income levels. The role of the fund will be to provide such groups with the support required to more fully&#13;
master the techniques employed in their environment.&#13;
The fund will provide training support to target groups that have obtained financing in order to assist&#13;
them in more fully achieving their project objectives or more effectively managing their enterprises.&#13;
The fund will give particular attention to youths who have chosen to enter apprenticeship training. It will&#13;
cover 90% of apprenticeship training costs for those aged 21 years or under.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
The VTSF will help women more effectively manage their projects and better understand the various&#13;
aspects of the life of an enterprise. The objective is to ensure the harmonious development of enterprises created&#13;
by women and thereby to promote fuller integration of women into the country's economic and social&#13;
development process.&#13;
Measure 12&#13;
To ensure that the fund remains autonomous and is replenished on a continual basis, the following&#13;
measures are planned:&#13;
a Vocational Training Tax equivalent to 0.5% of the payroll of private, mixed and statwned&#13;
enterprises (deducted from their standard tax assessment), to be accompanied by regular and rigorous accountiz&#13;
procedures;&#13;
a cost recovery policy requiring that beneficiaries or sponsors contribute 25% of the costs of trag&#13;
financed by the VTSF (10% in the case of young apprentices aged 21 or below).&#13;
Measure 13&#13;
Training of skilled trainers is of critical importance in achieving the vocational training objectives (in-&#13;
service training, apprenticeship training). Efforts will focus on&#13;
trainers in VTSF-approved private vocational training institutions&#13;
*      trainers in qualified training centers recognized by VTSF&#13;
*      heads of workshops and micro-enterprises who agree to collaborate with the VTSF in apprenticeship&#13;
training;&#13;
*      human resource managers in formal sector enterprises, specifically for the purpose of encouraging them&#13;
to design training plans and improve personnel management;&#13;
*      officials of NGOs and professional organizations who are responsible for designing training projects&#13;
and/or training economic operators in the infonnal sector.&#13;
Beneficiaries shall contribute to the cost of their training on the basis of the criteria set by the VTSF.&#13;
Measure 14&#13;
The VTSF will provide financial support to training centers and institutions through the equipment and&#13;
investment programs to be implemented in accordance with the fund's objectives. This support shall not exceed&#13;
50% of the total cost of any investment proposed by a training institution and breaks down as follows:&#13;
a grant equivalent to 25% of the investment cost&#13;
an interest-free loan equivalent to 25% of the investment cost, i.e. with an interest rate of zero. However,&#13;
the beneficiary will be charged a fee equal to 2.5% of the total loan amount.&#13;
Measure 15&#13;
The Ministry of National Education cannot, in and of itself, meet all training needs in Mali. Informal&#13;
training, based on the principle of acquiring knowledge of a trade through on-the-job training, is the most&#13;
widespread method and reaches a large number of youths. However, this type of training requires follow-up&#13;
training in order to make new technologies accessible to youth who have participated in an apprenticeship.&#13;
To this end, the Govemment has taken the following steps:&#13;
requirement for validation of skills covered by recognized modules;&#13;
establishment of a certification mechanism that will be gradually expanded to include all trades within&#13;
the District and in other areas of the country;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
mobilization and involvement of concerned public and private sector structures in order to ensure that the&#13;
required follow-up training is conducted;&#13;
design of training content for specific skills and organization of training content for specific modules.&#13;
Acquiring fuller knowledge of the labor market: measures to be taken.&#13;
The lack of reliable statistical data on employment and training today represents a major obstacle to&#13;
formulating an employment policy in Mali. Employment data, if they exist at all, often are not collected,&#13;
processed and disseminated. Moreover, they are not treated as a tool for promoting and generating employment,&#13;
or for ensuring an appropriate linkage between training and employment. To correct these deficiencies, the&#13;
Government has established the Employment and Training observatory and intends to provide it with the&#13;
necessary means to accomplish its mission.&#13;
Measure 16&#13;
The Government has set the objectives of promoting employment through human resource development,&#13;
promoting enterpnrses and promoting decentralized development. To meet these goals, the National Manpower&#13;
and Employment Office (ONMOE) will provide the Employment and Training Observatory with the sum of&#13;
CFAF 95 million per year throughout the life of the project.&#13;
Beginning 1996, the ONMOE agrees to submit to IDA its progress and budget implementation report&#13;
for the previous fiscal year by May 31.&#13;
The Government of Mali is confident that these measures, taken as a whole, will meet the goal of&#13;
upgrading technical education and vocational training by restoring all of the qualities needed to train skilled&#13;
workers who are well adapted to the requirements of the labor market, thereby serving to increase the&#13;
competitiveness of enterprises, improve the quality of services provided by artisans and strengthen the capacity of&#13;
the structures responsible for promoting employment.&#13;

ANNEX 2.1&#13;
MALI&#13;
Vocational Education and Training Consolidation Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The following economic analysis of the Mali VET Consolidation Project comprises&#13;
several aspects: (a) the placement of the project in the larger macro-economic context,&#13;
considering the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Mali and future growth trends,&#13;
particularly in light of the devaluation of the CFAF: (b) qualitative and quantitative results&#13;
from employer and manpower surveys, which indicate difficulties in finding skilled labor in&#13;
certain trades on the Malian labor market; (c) calculations of the rate of return to&#13;
vocational education and training services, based on unit costs, wages and probability of&#13;
employment by training stream, and  sensitivity analyses of these rate of return&#13;
calculations, to determine key variables for scrutiny during implementation; (d) the&#13;
development of a least-cost alternative for VET investments; (e) fiscal impact analysis,&#13;
which examines the recurrent cost impact of proposed project investments and compares&#13;
this to current spending levels, and addresses cost-recovery issues; (f) institutional&#13;
analysis, which assesses the capacity of the National Technical and Vocational Education&#13;
Division, the Vocational Training Support Fund and the Employment and Training&#13;
Observatory to implement this project; and (g) poverty analysis, which specifies which&#13;
benefits would go to the poor and examines the project's impact on beneficiaries' incomes.&#13;
Based on this analysis, economic performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation are&#13;
included in Annex 6.5.)   Viewed together, the economic analysis of the Mali VET&#13;
Consolidation Project permits a positive overall assessment and argues for the project's&#13;
financing.&#13;
A.   Macroeconomic Context and the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy for Mali&#13;
Mali is a vast, landlocked and resource-poor country located in the Sahelian zone&#13;
of western Africa. Per capita income is estimated at just US$250 (1994) and social&#13;
indicators (such as life expectancy, literacy and infant mortality) are among the lowest in&#13;
the world. More than 75 percent of the population, estimated at about 9 million in 1995,&#13;
is engaged in the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 50 percent of&#13;
GDP. Growth in this sector is conditioned by variable rainfall, fragile soils and low-&#13;
productivity traditional technologies. The weak human resource base and scarcity of&#13;
technical skills pose a formidable obstacle to both agricultural and industrial development.&#13;
These problems are compounded by high population growth (2.7%) which puts severe&#13;
pressure on both the limited natural resource base and the financial resources available for&#13;
basic public services and productive investments, which in turn restricts employment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 2 of 10&#13;
On the bright side, real GDP grew an average of 3.1% annually between 1992-&#13;
1994 (following stagnant GDP growth between 1980 and 1991), and the devaluation of&#13;
the West African Franc (CFAF) in early 1994 offers the country the possibility to exploit&#13;
its comparative advantages in agriculture, agro-processing, and production of low-&#13;
technology import substitutes, thereby increasing employment and incomes for both rural&#13;
and urban populations.  Furthermore, recent macroeconomic management has been&#13;
largely positive, with all macroeconomic objectives achieved in 1994 and through June&#13;
1995. Inflation has been contained, exports have increased significantly, and fiscal and&#13;
current account deficits in 1994 were lower than programmed. Private capital reflows&#13;
have picked up and private consumption is shifting to local products. The three-year&#13;
public investment program for 1994-1996 is being satisfactorily implemented, and real&#13;
GDP is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.0% between 1995 and 1997. The&#13;
overall picture which emerges is one of opportunity, which must be supported by&#13;
investments to generate the needed supply response, particularly in the area of human&#13;
resources.  The Mali VET Consolidation Project represents an example of such&#13;
investments.&#13;
The goal of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Mali is the alleviation&#13;
of poverty through a 3-pronged approach: (i) sustained broad-based economic growth, (ii)&#13;
human resources development and (iii) a special focus on the needs of the most vulnerable.&#13;
Sound macroeconomic management and local institutional capacity-building are essential&#13;
to achieving these goals. In operational terms, this strategy requires investment and&#13;
adjustment lending in education, training, health, agriculture, infrastructure, and urban job&#13;
creation. The proposed vocational education and training project responds to all three&#13;
aspects of the Bank's strategy: by developing skills which correspond to new employmnent&#13;
opportunities, particularly among individuals working in the informal sector, the Bank&#13;
would contribute to economic growth, human resources development and target the needs&#13;
of relatively disadvantaged groups in urban areas.&#13;
B.    Labor Market Demand&#13;
A series of 7 labor market and training surveys were conducted during project&#13;
preparation to ascertain labor market demand in both formal and informal sectors, in&#13;
Bamako and in the regions, and to identify vocational training streams most likely to lead&#13;
to employment. These studies included: an analysis of employment and salary trends using&#13;
the Annual Manpower Survey for the years 1988-1993; a tracer study of recent VET&#13;
graduates; a study of private sector training needs in Bamako; an analysis of the&#13;
apprenticeship/production system in the informal sector; an analysis of economic growth&#13;
and employment trends in the regions; a reverse tracer study of recent VET graduates; and&#13;
a study regarding women's constraints to training and training needs. A synthesis of these&#13;
studies indicates important labor market growth opportunities afler devaluation, increasing&#13;
demand for skilled manpower and heightened employer concern over the quality of trained&#13;
staff available (for more information see Annex 2.2).&#13;
More specifically, significant growth in production and employment are expected&#13;
over in the medium term in the following areas: basic industries (principally textiles, agro-&#13;
industry and simple import substitution), construction, public works, transport, hotels and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 3 of 10&#13;
tourism, crafts, and small and mediun' enterprises.  Siiiilai conclusions regarding&#13;
promising economic sub-sectors were reoche(d in the World Baank's 1994 Private Sector&#13;
Assessment for Mali. This will require technically qualified specialists in maintenance,&#13;
mechanics (general, auto and truck), metalwork, electiicity, construction and&#13;
accounting/management. Mid-level skilled workers will be most in demand (i.e. people&#13;
willing and able to perform skilled tasks themselves and supervise others, if needed).&#13;
Geographic centers for employment growth include Bamako and the regional capitals of&#13;
Sikasso, Segou and Kayes. These regional capitals correspond, respectively, to the&#13;
cotton, rice and mining production areas, which are developing rapidly following the 1994&#13;
CFAF devaluation. Currently, mid-level technical skills are often imported to meet this&#13;
demand from Senegal, Togo, Ivory Coast, even the Philippines (for example, for&#13;
construction of the Selingue Dam and the West African Central Bank, routine mechanical&#13;
repair jobs in industry, and development of the mining sector).&#13;
An analysis of trends in monthly salaries by economic sector and training level&#13;
between 1990 and 1993 suggests an increasing scarcity of skilled manual labor in agro-&#13;
processing, mining, construction, transport and banking industries (See tables in Annex&#13;
2.2). For example, in the construction sector, average salaries for all levels of workers&#13;
increased 26% per year on average between 1990 and 1993, while average salaries for&#13;
skilled manual laborers in the construction industry increased by almost 80% per year. In&#13;
agro-industry, average salaries for all workers rose by 14% per year, while those for&#13;
skilled manual laborers in the same industry increased by 41%. Siniilarly, skilled manual&#13;
laborers in the mining sector increased their salaries by 40% per year on average. These&#13;
figures compare most favorably to average annual increases in salaries for all levels of&#13;
workers in all economic sectors over this period (6%), and to average salary increases for&#13;
all skilled manual laborers (14%). For comparison's sake, skilled workers in commerce&#13;
saw their salaries decline by an average of 12% per year, while those in the utilities sector&#13;
experienced just 2% annual growth over this same period.&#13;
The VET trainee tracer study yielded somewhat less er'couraging results. Fifteen&#13;
months after graduation approximately one-half of graduates had worked or participated&#13;
in additional training, although at the tinme of the survey only 20% of trainees with a&#13;
Brevet Technicien (BT) and 28% of trainees with a Certificat d'Aptitud Professionnel&#13;
(CAP) declared they were employed. (It is important to note that in many cases graduates&#13;
who declared themselves unemployed were working in the informal sector and earning&#13;
money; they did not have a formal sector job and so considered themselves unemployed.)&#13;
By comparison, 40% of individuals surveyed from the control group stated they were&#13;
employed (although this group had more time to find a job). Among CAP graduates,&#13;
those with training in accounting, woodworking, mechanics, plumnbing, banking and&#13;
building design were most successful in finding a job, while those in masonry, electricity,&#13;
and agricultural mechanics were least likely to find a job. Amonig BT graduates, the most&#13;
successful graduates had degrees in civil works, maintenance, general mechanics,&#13;
secretarial skills and accounting. The least successful graduates had degrees in customs,&#13;
taxes, metal work and refrigeration. The vast majority of graduates f ere working in fields&#13;
which corresponded to their training. TIhis was particularly tl-oe .S ang BT graduates,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 4 of 10&#13;
and the control group. Regionally, graduates in Sikasso and Segou did as well or better&#13;
than their counterparts in Bamako.&#13;
These results must be interpreted in light of the fact that the survey was&#13;
undertaken shortly before the devaluation of the CFAF. Before devaluation few firms&#13;
were hiring, the private sector was stagnant, fraudulent and legal importation of&#13;
undervalued goods discouraged local production and employment.  Shortly after&#13;
devaluation, many firms found themselves in serious financial difficulties as external debts&#13;
doubled in value, local purchasing power declined and consumers waited until prices&#13;
stabilized. It is only recently (end of 1994/early 1995) that local production and&#13;
investment have rebounded (new investments in textiles, agro-processing, mines,&#13;
construction, etc.). It would be very useful and illuminating to conduct the same survey of&#13;
the same graduates in December of 1995.&#13;
Nevertheless, some conclusions regarding training streams can be drawn, however&#13;
tentatively. CAP graduates do slightly better than BT graduates, in large measure because&#13;
they are more willing to accept whatever job they can find. Accounting, civil works,&#13;
general and auto mechanics, woodworking, and secretarial training programs are relatively&#13;
successful. VET graduate success in the regions (such as Sikasso and Segou) suggest&#13;
opportunities for additional VET investments outside of Bamako&#13;
The regional survey of 222 employers and artisans focused primarily on&#13;
growth, employment and salary trends in the informal sector. Employers provided&#13;
estimates of total sales ("chiffres d'affaires") for the years 1992-94, and forecasts for the&#13;
years 1995-1997. The most promising economic sub-sectors appear to be construction,&#13;
civil works, metalwork, maintenance/repair and hotel/restaurants, all of which, according&#13;
to the employers interviewed, experienced at least 20% growth between 1992-94 and are&#13;
projected to increase by at least 30% between 1995-97. Sales in textiles were sluggish&#13;
between 1992-94 but are projected to increase by 44% between 1995-97.&#13;
Relative to their existing workforce, employers forecast an increase in new hires&#13;
equivalent to 43% between 1995-1997. By economic sub-sector, construction, transport,&#13;
and agro-industry account for 68% of the anticipated new hires, while employment in&#13;
woodworking and commerce is projected to remain stable. Employers justified new&#13;
recruitment on the grounds of expanded production and the search for more qualified&#13;
workers. Skilled workers are expected to be the professional category most in demand,&#13;
representing 44% of projected demand (relative to apprentices, 33%, and highly skilled&#13;
workers, 6%).   Skills in accounting/management, construction and civil works, and&#13;
mechanics will be most in demand.&#13;
Interestingly, employers' assessments of the potential for agro-industry were less&#13;
promising, with a 15% average annual growth forecast in sales and just an 8% growth&#13;
forecast in employment. This relatively pessimistic assessment of agro-industry prospects&#13;
is perhaps surprising, considering its recent growth following devaluation and its&#13;
assessment from the macroeconomic perspective as one of the most economic sub-sectors.&#13;
But this can be explained by the regional nature of the survey, in areas where purchasing&#13;
power for processed agricultural products is limited, food self-sufficiency is preferred, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 5 of 10&#13;
food conservation and transportation is difficult. The same survey in Bamako would&#13;
probably reveal a different perspective.&#13;
C.    Rate of Return and Sensititivity Analyses&#13;
Private and social rates of return to 2- and 4- year vocational education and&#13;
training were calculated, overall and by training stream. These rates are relative to 9 years&#13;
of basic education leading to the Basic Education Diploma, the prerequisite for entry into&#13;
formal VET training institutions. These rates were calculated applying data from the&#13;
Annual Manpower Surveys regarding salaries by education and training levels, unit cost&#13;
information by training stream (both investment and recurrent), and hypotheses with&#13;
respect to the probability of VET obtaining jobs in their field, derived in part from the&#13;
VET tracer study discussed above.&#13;
For 2-year VET (corresponding to the Certificat d'Aptitud Professionnel), the&#13;
private and social rates of return are estimated at 30% and 11%, respectively. For 4-year&#13;
VET (corresponding to the Brevet Technicien), the private and social rates of return are&#13;
estimated at 33% and 17%, respectively. (See tables in back of annex for calculations.)&#13;
Note that these calculations are based on wages in the modem sector and so may&#13;
overestimate average trainee earnings. On the other hand, quite conservative estimates&#13;
were used with respect to the probability of employment (a maximum of 75% three years&#13;
after graduation).&#13;
Sensitivity analysis suggests that to achieve at least a 10% social rate of return&#13;
among CAP trainees overall, at least 60% need to find a job within three years of&#13;
graduation, which pays at least 60,000 FCFA per month (about US$110). For BT&#13;
trainees overall, at least 75% need to be employed within three years of graduation, and&#13;
earning at least 90,000 FCFA per month (about US$180). This seems quite plausible&#13;
given current employment and salary trends, as discussed above.&#13;
Not surprisingly, rates of return vary considerably by training stream. CAP-level&#13;
training in construction suggests private and social rates of return of 51% and 16%,&#13;
respectively. To achieve a minimum 10% social rate of return, at least 65% of&#13;
construction trainees would need to be employed and earning at least 75,000 FCFA per&#13;
month within three years of graduation. With respect to training in agro-mechanics, CAP-&#13;
level training indicates private and social rates of return of 33% and 10%, respectively. At&#13;
least 70% of trainees would need to be employed within 3 years and earning at least&#13;
70,000 FCFA per month to achieve a 10% social rate of return. Finally, CAP-level&#13;
training in auto mechanics for the transport sector appears to offer private and social rate&#13;
of returns of 44% and 12%, respectively, with a 10% social rate of return contingent upon&#13;
at least 55% of trainees employed and earning at least 65,000 FCFA within 3 years of&#13;
graduation. Once again, these minimum requirements appear attainable given growth in&#13;
employment and earnings in these sectors.&#13;
Training in accounting at the BT-level suggests private and social rates of return of&#13;
34% and 24%, respectively, with a minimum of 55% of graduates employed and earning&#13;
at least 70,000 FCFA per month within three years of graduation in order to achieve a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 6 of 10&#13;
10% social rate of return. Meanwhile, VET training in electro-mechanics for the&#13;
manufacturing sector indicates private and social rates of return of 26% and 10%,&#13;
respectively.  At least 70% of all trainees in this stream would need to be working and&#13;
earning at least 90,000 FCFA per month within 3 years of graduation to ensure a 10%&#13;
social rate of return. This same training for the mining sector indicates private and social&#13;
rates of return of 27% and 18%, respectively.&#13;
For in-service training, rate of return calculations are more conjectural, as&#13;
empirical information concerning unit costs and trainees salaries is not available.&#13;
Nonetheless, it is possible to estimate both unit costs and salaries before and after training,&#13;
in order to calculate a hypothetical rate of return. Assuming a unit cost of US$ 140 per&#13;
month of training (the figure used in the Project Cost Tables), a US$ 10 increase in&#13;
monthly earnings 12 months after training, and a slight increase in the probability of being&#13;
employed after training, Bank staff estimated the social rate of return to the Vocational&#13;
Training Support Fund at 34% (see attached tables). To achieve a minimum 10% rate of&#13;
return, trainees would have to be at least as likely to be employed after the training as&#13;
before, and they would have to be earning at least US$ 7 more per month after the&#13;
training. Assuming the training financed meets certain economic, financial and pedagogic&#13;
criteria, this minimum rate of return appears likely to be achieved.&#13;
Commentary: Great care must be taken in interpreting these results. Relative&#13;
salaries of BT, CAP and basic education graduates, differientiated by training stream and&#13;
economic sector, must be evaluated loosely in a country such as Mali. For example, the&#13;
VET Tracer Study discussed above, which used a much smaller sample relative to the&#13;
Annual Manpower Survey and covered only an 18-month time span, found much smaller&#13;
salary differences between training levels. Results from this study indicated average&#13;
private sector salaries of 40,000 CFAF per month for BT graduates, 37,200 CFAF per&#13;
month for CAP graduates and 35,500 CFAF per month for the control group, although&#13;
the standard variations were quite large. Looking only at salary levels of graduates and&#13;
the control group and using a simplified calculation which ignores training costs and future&#13;
differences in earnings, rates of return averaged just 3%. In another example, the Reverse&#13;
Tracer Study (discussed in Arunex 2.2) indicates much greater variation in average salaries&#13;
by training levels. Using thie same methodology used in the Tracer Study but the salary&#13;
levels found in the Reverse Tracer Study. rate of rcturns to CAP and BT training averaged&#13;
18% and 21%, respectivel,.. This shows that a vanlety of surveys and studies are needed -&#13;
when several studies point to tdie same conclusion, the results are much more robust.&#13;
D.    The )evelopictent of a Least -Cast Alternative for Formal VET&#13;
Services&#13;
The Bank's experience in financing the development of VET programs around the&#13;
world clearly demonstrats that quality vocational training is expensive relative to general&#13;
education. Equipment costs, raw material expenses, the need for small classes to ensure&#13;
adequate practical training, etc., all increase unit costs. In this context, the preparation of&#13;
this project adopted a least-cost alternative approach which attempted to reduce these unit&#13;
costs and included the following elements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 7 of 10&#13;
*     The design of multi-use facilities, so that different training streams can use&#13;
the same equipment and workshops, for maximum utilisation of training capacity.&#13;
For example, joint training facilities were designed for masonry and plumbing;&#13;
general and auto mechanics; carpentry, woodworking and cabinet-making.  In&#13;
addition, under this system, the recruitment of students varies each year by training&#13;
stream, which avoids over-saturating the labor market.&#13;
The sharing of training facilities for the CAP and BT in the following&#13;
training streams: auto mechanics, metalwork and electrical contracting. Until now,&#13;
both CAP- and BT- level training institutions maintained their own facilities, which&#13;
resulted in unnecessary duplication.  Project preparation resulted in plans to&#13;
rearrange the present location of training facilities so that both institutions can&#13;
access them.&#13;
*     Full-time use of training facilities.  VET institutions in Mali have&#13;
traditionally operated according to the school calendar, open for nine months a&#13;
year and only during the day. Under the project, the legal texts regulating public&#13;
VET institutions would be modified, so that VET centers can operate twelve&#13;
months a year and in the evenings, offering both pre-service and in-service training.&#13;
*     An in-depth needs assessment of training equipment, conducted with VET&#13;
instructors themselves, which included an inventory of all existing equipment and&#13;
material for all 8 training streams considered under the project, complete with&#13;
qualitative judgements as to the condition and appropriateness of the equipment&#13;
for the training to be offered.  This ensured that the project would not finance&#13;
equipment which already exists or which is not absolutely necessary for the&#13;
training.&#13;
*     The development of training links between VET centers and private&#13;
enterprises, to facilitate the participation of instructors and students in enterprise-&#13;
based apprenticeship programs, using on-site equipment for training rather than&#13;
purchasing the equipment for the VET center.&#13;
*     Continued analysis of labor market demand and assessment of existing&#13;
private training capacity.  In this case, the appraisal mission discussed with&#13;
Government authorities the new construction of a privately-operated Catholic pre-&#13;
service training center in Sikasso.  Based on mission estimates of future labor&#13;
market demand, the mission decided that certain investments in pre-service VET&#13;
training in Sikasso (proposed during pre-appraisal) were no longer justifiable.&#13;
Applying this approach during the appraisal mission resulted in significant savings.&#13;
Relative to estimates made during pre-appraisal, the final estimates for civil works and&#13;
equipment required for consolidating formal VET services declined from US$ 6.2 million&#13;
to US$ 3.8 million.  It is argued that this is the lowest cost alternative for ensuring&#13;
adequate quality pre-service VET training in Mali, covering 5 training institutions and 8&#13;
training streams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 8 ofl0&#13;
E.    Fiscal Impact Analysis and Cost-Recovery Issues&#13;
Additional recurrent costs linked to investments in pre-service VET are estimated&#13;
in nominal terms at CFAF 150 million, beginning in 1998, primarily for equipment&#13;
maintenance, repairs and raw materials. Relative to 1995 expenditures, this would be&#13;
equivalent to an increase in real terms of 9% for pre-service VET materials, of 4% in total&#13;
VET expenditures, or 0.5% in total education spending. Assurances would be sought&#13;
from the Government that as of 1998 it would increase educational materials financing to&#13;
CFAF 60,000 per VET student (from its current level of CFAF 50,000 per student), and&#13;
to maintain this as a minimum for the duration of project implementation; this increase&#13;
should be covered primarily by reducing scholarship expenditures, although some&#13;
additional resources may be required.  Total VET unit costs (both investment and&#13;
recurrent) would increase to about US$750 per y;  equivalent to approximately two&#13;
times general secondary unit costs. This 2:1 ratio 4f9BET to general secondary unit costs&#13;
conforms to international norms and reflects the acded costs for equipment, materials,&#13;
practical training and smaller classes.  Additional recurrent costs linked to project&#13;
investments in the Employment and Training Observatory are estimated at 85 million&#13;
CFAF per year, equivalent to about 14% of the National Manpower Office's total&#13;
expenditures in 1994. These costs would be financed from re-allocations of the National&#13;
Manpower Office's budget (which is primarily financed by a 1% payroll tax on private and&#13;
parastatal employers), and would not have an impact on the Government budget.&#13;
Personnel needs would be covered through redeployment and training. Finally, if needed,&#13;
funds from the Vocational Training Tax could go to finance pre-service VET recurrent&#13;
costs, as well, with the approval of the VTSF Management Committee. In summary, the&#13;
expected fiscal impact should be manageable and dealt with primarily through re-&#13;
allocations of existing resources, rather than additional monies.&#13;
For the first time in Mali, employer contributions and beneficiary cost recovery for&#13;
VET services would be institutionalized. Employers would contribute approximately&#13;
CFAF 300 million per year to the Vocational Training Support Fund, through a 0.5%&#13;
payroll tax for vocational training, while informal sector artisans would be expected to&#13;
contribute about CFAF 50 million per year through the payment of a registration tax&#13;
("patente"). Combined with World Bank financing, this would allow the Training Fund&#13;
to finance up to 75% of the cost of individual training sub-projects. The remaining 25%&#13;
would be paid by the training beneficiaries themselves, or by their sponsors and/or&#13;
employers. In this way the Bank would be leveraging additional resources for vocational&#13;
training, and ensuring that the beneficiaries of this training contribute, rather than the&#13;
State. Based on the differences between estimated private and social rates of return to this&#13;
training, such an arrangement is entirely justified.&#13;
F.    Institutional Analysis&#13;
There would be three primary institutions involved in the implementation of the&#13;
VET Consolidation Project: the National Division for Technical and Vocational Training&#13;
(DNETP), the Vocational Training Support Fund, and the Employment and Training&#13;
Observatory under the National Manpower Office.  Only the first of these institutions&#13;
exists at this time and it is weak; the second two would be created under the project. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
page 9 of 10&#13;
this sense, institutional capacity or the lack thereof, may present the greatest economic&#13;
risk to this project.&#13;
This issue is being addressed under the project in a variety of ways. With respect&#13;
to the National Division for Technical and Vocational Training, it was created just two&#13;
years ago and lacks the personnel required and the minimum basic working conditions&#13;
(adequate offices, office equipment, etc.) to be effective.  Given macroeconomic&#13;
constraints, personnel needs would have to be addressed through training and technical&#13;
assistance, and the project envisions approximately 160 person-months of such assistance,&#13;
in the areas of financial and personnel management, private/public sector relations,&#13;
curriculum development, in-service teacher training and student assessment. The project&#13;
would also ensure that DNETP personnel have adequate offices and equipment to enable&#13;
them to carry out their mission. (See the SAR for a full description of this support.) In&#13;
other words, the project would attempt to strengthen the key strategic functions of the&#13;
DNETP, and put in place efficient procedures for the allocation and use of public funds for&#13;
both pre-service VET and skills upgrading.  Government would be better able to&#13;
administer the VET system, while stimulating the provision of training through the private&#13;
sector.  Direct involvement of employers in management of both pre-service and in-&#13;
service VET training would improve the system's responsiveness to demand in the labor&#13;
market, a vital aspect of the project's economic benefits.&#13;
As for the Vocational Training Support Fund, it is a new structure to be put in&#13;
place, and as such, is likely to experience "institutional birthing pains". To reduce these&#13;
pains, project preparation focused on building a strong consensus around the Fund among&#13;
all actors concerned, including Government, employers, artisans, NGOs, private training&#13;
centers and certain potential beneficiary groups. This exercise led to the development of a&#13;
highly-detailed Operations Manual, complete with all legal texts, application forms,&#13;
evaluation criteria, financial administration, procurement and disbursement procedures,&#13;
etc.. A first draft of this Operational Manual was widely shared among the groups&#13;
identified above and, following the incorporation of their comments, a second version was&#13;
validated and finalized with World Bank assistance.  In addition, project design envisions&#13;
considerable support to Fund personnel, especially during the start-up phase. Training,&#13;
technical assistance, vehicles, office equipement, etc. are all to be financed under the&#13;
project.&#13;
With respect to the Employment and Training Observatory (ETO), few&#13;
institutional problems are anticipated. The ETO would operate under the guidance of the&#13;
National Manpower Office and would be staffed by specialists, most of whom already&#13;
have training in labor market information collection and analysis. The project would&#13;
support this personnel with a 7-module training program and 16 person-months of&#13;
technical assistance overseen by the International Labor Office. In addition, the project&#13;
envisions the renovation of offices and the provision of computers, other office&#13;
equipement, means of transportation, and essential reference materials. Viewed in their&#13;
ensemble, this project financing should develop the necessary institutional capacity within&#13;
the ETO to fulfill its mission and achieve the project's objectives.&#13;

G.   Poverty Analysis&#13;
The Mali VET Consolidation Project would primarily address skill defiiciencies&#13;
among urban workers, a large proportion of whom are poor. In general, the urban poor&#13;
have very little general or vocational education and training. This, in turn, limits their&#13;
access to employment and revenue-generating activities. Under the project, through the&#13;
Vocational Training Support Fund, approximately 8,000 workers and apprentices would&#13;
benefit from one month of in-service training each year for five years, with relatively poor&#13;
informal sector workers and apprentices constituting approximately 50% of all&#13;
beneficiaries. In other words, the project would provide approximately 20,000 poor&#13;
workers with skills upgrading. These workers should demonstrate improved vocational&#13;
and entrepreneurial skills, thereby improving productivity, labor mobility, employment&#13;
prospects, and earnings.&#13;
Among students reaching upper secondary education, those oriented to pre-service&#13;
VET training demonstrate lower academic achievement at the basic education level than&#13;
those oriented to general secondary. Such lower achievement is positively correlated in&#13;
Mali with socio-economic status, meaning that pre-service VET students, in general, come&#13;
from poorer households than students oriented to general secondary. In addition, many&#13;
students now request to be oriented to pre-service VET training, rather than to general&#13;
secondary. Typically, these students come from households which cannot afford the&#13;
opportunity costs of education through the highest levels, and so they choose training&#13;
which can enable them to find a job as quickly as possible.  Under the project,  1,120&#13;
students per year (for approximately fifteen years) would benefit from pre-service VET&#13;
investments.  It is not unreasonable to expect that at least 50%  of these 17,000&#13;
beneficiaries will come from relatively poor households.&#13;
Women, in particular, have very low levels of literacy, basic education and&#13;
training, and very little access to training opportunities. On the other hand, they represent&#13;
a large share of workers in the informal sector, engaged in agro-processing, dressmaking,&#13;
soapmaking, dyeing, commerce, and other trades. Through the Vocational Training&#13;
Support Fund, the project would reach out and support the training of female workers in&#13;
small and micro-enterprises, in both formal and informal sectors, and would provide&#13;
women with greater opportunities to enhance their skills, productivity and earnings. To&#13;
ensure this, project design calls for the appointment of a Womens' Training Specialist to&#13;
the Training Fund, who would be responsable for initiating contacts among womens'&#13;
groups, explaining the Fund, providing technical assistance to women interested in&#13;
applying for Fund financing, and ensuring that Fund-financed training activities are&#13;
adapted in content, location and cost to womens' needs.&#13;
In summary, approximately one-half of project beneficiaries are expected to come&#13;
from relatively poor households, with the rest coming from the lower-middle and middle&#13;
classes. The project would make special efforts to see that women represent at least 40%&#13;
of all in-service trainees, although specific quotas with respect to Fund financing for&#13;
women would not be applied.&#13;

Annex 2.2&#13;
Synthesis of Mali Labor Market and Training Studies&#13;
As part of preparation for the Vocational Education and Training Consolidation&#13;
Project a series of 7 labor market and training studies were commissioned. These&#13;
studies were financed by a Japanese PHRD grant and were carried out between&#13;
November 1994 and September 1995. The preparation of terms of reference for these&#13;
studies, the selection of consultants and the review of preliminary reports were&#13;
undertaken jointly by the Mali Project Preparation Team ('Groupe de Pilotage') and&#13;
the World Bank. The studies included:&#13;
*     A Tracer Study of recent VET graduates&#13;
*     A Survey of New Employment Opportunities and Vocational Training&#13;
Needs in the Regions outside of Bamako&#13;
*     A Study of Nonformal Vocational Training and Apprenticeship&#13;
Training&#13;
*     A Reverse Tracer Study of VET graduates&#13;
*     A Private Sector Employer and Artisan Survey of Training Needs in&#13;
Bamako&#13;

In addition, an eighth study was commissioned, analysing employment and earnings as&#13;
discerned from a national household survey conducted in 1994. Unfortunately, the&#13;
consultant hired to do this study was unable to complete his work in time for the&#13;
preparation of the Yellow Cover SAR..&#13;
Studv 1: Tracer Study of 1993 VET Graduates:&#13;
Methodology&#13;
This study was undertaken by the National Directorate of Technical and Vocational&#13;
Education and the National Manpower and Employment Office, with close support&#13;
provided by the Institute for Education Research (IREDU) in Dijon, France. A sample&#13;
of 422 CAP-level graduates and 18 1 BT-level graduates was composed, reflecting the&#13;
distribution of 1993 VET graduates by level, specialty, school of training, and&#13;
constituting 25% of all VET graduates. Graduates were surveyed approximately 18&#13;
months after receiving their diplomas, and were located on the basis of their home&#13;
addresses indicated on their school enrollment forms. A second '"ontrol group" was&#13;
established, consisting of graduates of basic education (Grade 9) or of primary&#13;
education (Grade 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
Results&#13;
The majority of graduates were male, single, 23 years old, and residents of Bamako.&#13;
One-third of graduates' fathers worked for the Government (civil servant, teacher,&#13;
health worker, army, police, etc.), one-fifth worked in the agriculture sector, with the&#13;
rest working in business, services, transport, professional trades, etc..&#13;
Since graduation approximately one-half of graduates had worked or participated in&#13;
additional training, although at the time of the survey only 20% of BT graduates and&#13;
28% of CAP graduates declared they were employed. By comparison, 40% of&#13;
individuals surveyed from the control group stated they were employed.&#13;
Among CAP graduates, those with training in accounting, woodworking, mechanics,&#13;
plumbing, banking and building design were most successful in finding a job, while&#13;
those in masonry, electricity, and agricultural mechanics were least likely to find a job.&#13;
Among BT graduates, the most successful graduates had degrees in civil works,&#13;
maintenance, general mechanics,  secretarial skills and accounting.  The least&#13;
successful graduates had degrees in customs, taxes, metal work and refrigeration.&#13;
Average private sector salaries were 40,000 CFAF per month for BT graduates,&#13;
37,200 CFAF per month for CAP graduates and 35,500 CFAF per month for the&#13;
control group, although the standard variations were quite large. Looking only at&#13;
salary levels of graduates and the control group and using a simplified calculation-&#13;
which ignores training costs and future differences in earnings, rates of return averaged&#13;
about 3%.&#13;
The vast majority of graduates were working in fields which corresponded to their&#13;
training. This was particularly the case among BT grraduates, who were more likely to&#13;
wait for a job corresponding to their training than CAP graduates and the control&#13;
group.&#13;
Regionally, graduates in Sikasso and Segou did as well or better than their&#13;
counterparts in Bamako.&#13;
Interpretation of Results&#13;
Great care must be taken in interpreting these results, as the temptation is strong to&#13;
look only at the general numbers and decide pre-service VET is not worth the&#13;
investment.  It is important to note that in many cases graduates who declared&#13;
themselves unemployed were in fact working in the informal sector and earning money&#13;
- they did not have a formal sector job and so considered themselves 'Unemployed".&#13;
Indeed, a follow-up survey of BT graduates in metal work and refrigeration revealed&#13;
that ALL graduates were earning income in the informal sector. Furthermore, given&#13;
the number of CAP and BT specialties (13 and 18, respectively), sample sizes were&#13;
often too small to draw meaningful conclusions.&#13;
Thirdly, the devaluation of the West African Franc occurred about 7 months after&#13;
graduation and surely had a short-term  negative impact on employment.  Before&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
devaluation few firms were hiring, the private sector was stagnant, fraudulent and legal&#13;
importation of undervalued goods discouraged local production and employment.&#13;
Shortly after devaluation, many firms found themselves in serious financial difficulties&#13;
as external debts doubled in value, local purchasing power declined and consumers&#13;
waited until prices stabilized.  It is only recently (end of 1994/early 1995) that local&#13;
production and investment have rebounded (new investments in textiles, agro-&#13;
processing, mines, construction, etc.). It would be very useful and illuminating to&#13;
conduct the same survey of the same graduates in December of 1995.&#13;
Finally, relative salaries of BT, CAP and basic education graduates must be evaluated&#13;
loosely. As the Reverse Tracer Study indicates (Study 4 below), average salaries by&#13;
training levels can vary much more than is suggested by this study. Using the same&#13;
methodology used in the Tracer Study but the salary levels found in the Reverse Tracer&#13;
Study, rate of returns to CAP and BT training averaged 18% and 21%, respectively.&#13;
This shows that a variety of surveys and studies are needed - when several studies&#13;
point to the same conclusion the results are much more robust.&#13;
Nevertheless, some conclusions regarding training streams can be drawn, however&#13;
tentatively. CAP graduates do slightly better than BT graduates, in large measure'&#13;
because they are more willing to accept whatever job they can find. Accounting, civil&#13;
works, general and auto mechanics, woodworking, and secretarial training programs&#13;
are relatively successful. VET graduate success in the regions (such as Sikasso and&#13;
Segou) suggest opportunities for additional VET investments outside of Bamako.-&#13;
Finally, the accent must be placed on the quality of the training provided, rather than&#13;
the quantity.  In Bamako an expansion of VET capacity does not appear to be&#13;
justified. Efforts should go to improving the quality of existing VET capacity.&#13;
Studv 2: Survey of New Emplovment Onportunities and Vocational Trainin2&#13;
Needs in the Re2ions&#13;
Methodology&#13;
A survey of employers and artisans was conducted of 222 firns in 5 capital cities and 3&#13;
economically active towns in Mali. The sample was roughly representative of 11&#13;
economic  sub-sectors  (agro-industry,  textiles, wood, construction  materials,&#13;
metalwork, basic industries/maintenance, construction/civil works, transport, business,&#13;
hotelUrestaurants, and others). 75% of employers surveyed were in the informal sector,&#13;
in part because the formal private sector is virtually non-existent outside of Bamako.&#13;
Average firm size was just 3-5 workers.&#13;
Results&#13;
With respect to economic growth and employment opportunities, employers provided&#13;
estimates of total sales ('chiffres d'affaires') for the years 1992-94, and forecasts for&#13;
the years 1995-1997.  The most promising economic sub-sectors appear to be&#13;
construction, civil works, metal work, maintenance/repair and hotel/restaurants, all of&#13;
which experienced at least 20% growth between 1992-94 (according to the heads of&#13;
firms surveyed) and are projected to increase by at least 30% between 1995-97. Sales&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
in textiles were sluggish between 1992-94 but are projected to increase by 44%&#13;
between 1995-97. Agro-industry appears less promising, which is explained below.&#13;
Relative to their existing workforce, employers forecast an increase in new hires&#13;
equivalent to 43%  between 1995-1997.  By econornic sub-sector, construction,&#13;
transport, and agro-industry account for 68% of the anticipated new hires, while&#13;
employment in woodworking and commerce is projected to remain stable. Employers&#13;
justified new recruitment on the grounds of expanded production and the search for&#13;
more qualified workers. Skilled workers are expected to be the professional category&#13;
most in demand, representing 44% of projected demand (relative to apprentices, 33%,&#13;
and highly skilled workers, 6%).  Skills in accounting/management, construction and&#13;
civil works, and mechanics will be most in demand.&#13;
As for training needs, employers clearly identified the quality of their product as the&#13;
principle factor in their competitiveness. Interestingly, despite the generally favorable&#13;
attitude of employers towards basic and vocational education, very few employers&#13;
invested in training of their workers, mainly because there is no capacity for vocational&#13;
training adapted to enterprise needs close to the employer. Few employers cited the&#13;
risk of losing the trained employee or the opportunity costs of training as factors.&#13;
Interpretation of Results&#13;
Regional VET investments in construction, civil works, mechanics, metal work and-&#13;
accounting/management appear to be justified, given the projected increases in labor&#13;
market demand for these skills. Training should be adapted to economic realities; most&#13;
new hires will be in small, informal sector enterprises using relatively low-technology.&#13;
Note that this project labor market demand corresponds to the conclusions of the&#13;
World Bank Private Sector Assessment, which cited construction as a prime&#13;
opportunity for small investments for the domestic market. Two-year VET appears to&#13;
respond better to employment possibilities than four-year VET.&#13;
The 'poor assessment" of agro-industry prospects is perhaps surprising, considering its&#13;
recent growth and its assessment from the macroeconomic perspective as one of the&#13;
most economic sub-sectors. But this can be explained by the regional nature of the&#13;
survey, in areas where purchasing power for processed agricultural products is limited,&#13;
food self-sufficiency is preferred, and food conservation and transportation is difficult.&#13;
The same survey in Bamako would probably reveal a different perspective.&#13;

Studv 3: Nonformal Vocational Traininif and ADDrenticeshin Training&#13;
The objective of this study was to better understand the sociological, econornic and&#13;
pedagogical aspects of inforrnal sector vocational and apprenticeship training, to assess&#13;
the social demand for apprenticeship training, its cost effectiveness and the feasibility&#13;
of a Vocational Training Fund.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
500 apprentices, 300 master artisans and 200 apprentices' families were surveyed,&#13;
covering a wide and representative range of professional trades. The survey covered&#13;
Bamako, Segou, Sikasso and two secondary cities (Niono and Koutiala).  Close&#13;
consultation with artisan associations ensured easy access to artisans and their&#13;
apprentices.&#13;
Results&#13;
Sociological.   An estimated 65,000 apprentices participate in informal sector&#13;
vocational training, 45,000 in Bamako alone. This makes apprenticeship training&#13;
the primary source of vocational training in Mali. 63% of artisans surveyed stated&#13;
they employed apprentices, on average between 3-5. 60% of artisans never attended&#13;
primary school, and only 20% stated they had ever participated in organized vocational&#13;
training. Among apprentices, 68% declared to have attended primary school, and their-&#13;
average age was 23 years old (90% were between 15-30). 80% of apprentices stated&#13;
their intention was to set up their own business.&#13;
Apprenticeship training is based on informal agreements between the artisan, the&#13;
apprentice and his/her family. This social contract has the advantage of being simple&#13;
and flexible, and is based on respect for the artisan's professional skills and seniority.&#13;
On the other hand, apprentices have no objective means of '"raduating" and often end&#13;
up as cheap labor for the master artisan for many years. 70% of apprentices surveyed&#13;
stated they would be in favor of standardized apprenticeship certification procedures&#13;
which would allow them to "graduate" and market themselves more easily.&#13;
Pedagogv    Instruction is a function of production, on-the-job learning by doing.&#13;
Knowledge, skills and appropriate behavior are all passed on to the apprentice, through&#13;
observation, imitation, and trial-and-error. While effective in transmitting practical&#13;
skills, very little theoretical or written explanations are offered, in large part because&#13;
most of the artisans are illiterate themselves. Furthermore, training depends entirely on&#13;
the orders/contracts gained by the artisan, such that training may be very slow or&#13;
limited in range. An average, training lasts from 3-5 years, but up to 10 years.&#13;
Equipment is limited and generally of low quality, and artisans are typically traditional&#13;
and resistant to new technologies.&#13;
Well aware of apprenticeship's weaknesses, the vast majority of apprentices stated&#13;
they would be interested in complementary, theoretical training, such as might be&#13;
provided through a Vocational Training Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
Economic    Most artisans pay their apprentices a daily subsistence wage equivalent&#13;
to US$1-1.50: artisans get inexpensive labor and apprentices earn the opportunity to&#13;
learn practical skills. Parents rarely pay the artisans for training services, although they&#13;
do ensure medical care and food for their children. Apprentices may also earn a little&#13;
extra money on the side through their own production or from client tips.&#13;
The cost of establishing one's own business was estimated by apprentices at 100,000&#13;
CFAF, to be raised through personal savings and family assistance. According to 80%&#13;
of artisans and 79% of apprentices, the informal sector and their particular trade&#13;
offered additional employment opportunities. On the other hand, artisans expressed&#13;
reservations about training too many young people in their trades, as this would create&#13;
serious competition.&#13;
Interpretation of Results&#13;
The informal sector in Mali is changing rapidly. Artisans are organizing themselves&#13;
into trade associations, the Government is encouraging an institutional and legal&#13;
framework to promote informal sector development, the education system is unable to&#13;
respond to the education, training and employment aspirations of young people and&#13;
their families. New trades are appearing, and the link of certain ethnic groups to&#13;
certain trades is disappearing.&#13;
The fact that a majority of apprentices are literate and numerate, while most of their&#13;
masters are not, means that their training is limited to purely practical, low-technology&#13;
skills acquisition. An opportunity exists to provide complementary general skills and&#13;
theoretical training to apprentices, which would build on the practical skills acquired&#13;
through apprenticeship. A Vocational Training Fund could be an ideal vehicle to&#13;
provide this training. The development of apprenticeship certification procedures and&#13;
standards, which are accepted by artisans, employers and the Ministry of Education&#13;
would be an important step in improving the marketability of apprentices and the&#13;
respectability of the informal sector in general.&#13;
Studv 4: Reverse Tracer Study of VET 2raduates&#13;
The objective of this study was to follow the path of basic education and VET&#13;
graduates (CAP and BT) in the labor market, and to analyze for the three levels&#13;
relative success in the labor market (revenue, employment, security of employment,&#13;
application of training, opportunities for advancement, etc.), in order to determine the&#13;
most promising training streams in terms of employment and/or self-employment.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
A total of 450 graduates were surveyed, 121 basic education graduates, 196 from CAP&#13;
training and 13 1 from BT training. Graduates were simply identified through visits to&#13;
randomly selected work sites in Bamako, Segou, Sikasso and Kayes, primarily in the&#13;
modem  sector.  Unfortunately, selection of graduates was inconsiderate of their&#13;
distribution by training specialty, year of graduation, and economic sub-sector. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
means that the sample surveyed was not representative of the training system or of the&#13;
labor market. In general, the survey teams encountered considerable resistance from&#13;
the inforrnal sector which limited the sample to formal sector workers.&#13;
Results&#13;
Most graduates surveyed were male (83%), aged 20-29 years (80%), and products of&#13;
VET public institutions (rather than publicly-financed private VET centers). Two-&#13;
thirds of graduates were working in the formal sector, mainly in commerce (15%),&#13;
electricity/gas (14%), industry (13%) and construction (13%).  Basic education&#13;
graduates were most numerous in transport and business, while CAP et BT graduates&#13;
were found most in enterprises engaged in construction, civil works and electrical&#13;
supplies/services. The higher the training level the more likely graduates were to be&#13;
working in the fornal sector.&#13;
On average, basic education graduates needed 12 months to find a job, compared to 13&#13;
months for CAP and BT graduates.&#13;
Average salaries for BT graduates were 51,420 CFA per month, compared to 37,748&#13;
CFAF per month for CAP graduates and 27,847 CFAF for basic education graduates,&#13;
with large standard deviations. Graduates with degrees in accounting and electricity&#13;
had relatively high salaries.   43%  of graduates worked under contract, and the&#13;
probability of having a contract rose from 25% among basic education graduates, to&#13;
45% for CAP graduates and 56% among BT graduates. In general, graduates were -&#13;
very favorable about the quality of the training they received, and in its utility in finding&#13;
ajob.&#13;
24% of working CAP graduates had created their own job, compared to 33% of&#13;
working BT graduates and 19% of working basic education graduates. Training&#13;
streams most favorable for self-employment were construction, metalwork, electricity,&#13;
woodworking and refrigeration.&#13;
At the CAP level, the most promising training streams were judged to be accounting,&#13;
electricity, secretarial skills and mechanics. At the BT level, the most promising&#13;
streams were accounting, mechanics, electricity, commerce and construction/civil&#13;
works.&#13;
Interpretation of the Results&#13;
Given the rather weak survey methodology used for this study it is difficult to&#13;
generalize the results, much less use them to predict future results. Nevertheless, to&#13;
the extent that these results correspond to results obtained through more rigorous&#13;
survey methodology, they can be used for substantiation.&#13;

Study 5 - Training Needs of Private Sector EmDlovers and Artisans&#13;
Methodology&#13;
A survey of training needs for skilled workers was conducted among 156 private&#13;
sector enterprises, employing almost 6,750 skilled and highly skilled workers. The&#13;
survey covered 7 major economic activity branches: manufacturing, construction and&#13;
civil works; commerce and hotels; transport and communications; banking and&#13;
insurance; personal services and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). With the&#13;
exception of the NGOs surveyed, the number of enterprises surveyed in each branch&#13;
roughly correspond to the distribution of enterprises by branch in Bamako, so the&#13;
sample is fairly representative of the situation overall. The survey questionnaire was&#13;
examined and approved by the National Federation of Employers, which sent an open&#13;
letter to all employers requesting their participation in the survey. In most cases the&#13;
owners or directors of the enterprises themselves responded to the questionnaire. The&#13;
survey addressed: the structure of enterprise employment by training level; training&#13;
needs by level and stream;  skilled worker recruitment patterns, projections and&#13;
methods; employer attitudes about the quality of workers hired;  and employer&#13;
recommendations for vocational training. Employers were very interested in the&#13;
study and most of them stated that it was the first time a survey of their training&#13;
needs had ever been conducted.&#13;
Results&#13;
The most obvious finding of this survey is that there is very little contact between&#13;
vocational training institutions and employers. Very few employers are familiar with&#13;
the vocational and technical training centers operating in Bamako; more than 60% of&#13;
employers stated they did not know what vocational training programs were offered in&#13;
Bamako, at either pre-service or in-service levels. They are not involved in any way in&#13;
the programming, management, or financing of pre-service VET, and very few of them&#13;
participate in in-service training.  In general, employers do not value vocational&#13;
training graduates, whom they describe as lacking practical skills, disciplne,&#13;
responsibility and knowledge of machines.&#13;
Thirdly, because of cultural considerations and/or the priority for employee loyalty (as&#13;
opposed to productivity), most employers recruit workers based on family and other&#13;
social contacts, rather than on training and skill levels. This means that in many cases&#13;
positions for skilled workers are occupied by individuals who are illiterate or untrained.&#13;
The study juxtaposes thiis attitude of employers with respect to vocational trainees&#13;
with employers' training and recruitment needs.  Approximately one-quarter of&#13;
enterprises stated they had difficulty recruiting skilled workers with the requisite&#13;
training and experience, particularly in the areas of manufacturing, construction and&#13;
civil works, and hotels. Furthermore, over the last three years, almost two-thirds of&#13;
new skilled labor employment has been for manufacturing, construction, civil works&#13;
and transportation, with three times as many CAP-level graduates hired than BT-level&#13;
graduates. In the future, 65% of enterprises surveyed forecast significant investments&#13;
over the next 18 months, the vast majority to either modernize, increase production or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
improve product quality.  Almost 80%  of new hires (and replacement of existing&#13;
workers) linked to these investments are expected to be for skills which correspond to&#13;
training streams in construction/civil works, metal work, masonry, electricity and&#13;
mechanics. Investments in vocational training would seem, therefore, to be justified, if&#13;
the quality and relevance of such training were increased.&#13;
The study concludes that the devaluation of the West African Franc in early 1994&#13;
should increase the potential for import-substitution industrialization, using local inputs&#13;
and products, and improve the competitiveness of Malian products in both local and&#13;
regional markets.  Furthermore, the study identifies the lack of technical and&#13;
managerial skills as a critical constraint for developing the manufacturing sector in&#13;
Mali, along with the oppressive regulatory and fiscal framework, the dfficulty to obtain&#13;
credit, the weak tranport and energy infrastructure, and the dependency on imported&#13;
inputs&#13;
In order to bridge the gap between employers and training institutions, the study&#13;
recommends that pre-service training institutions offer in-service training services to&#13;
employers and their workers. This would be through the development of Enterprise&#13;
Support Units in each school, staffed by vocational instructors, who would offer their&#13;
services to employers on a partial cost-recovery basis for the analysis and identification&#13;
of enterprise training needs.&#13;
Interpretation of Results&#13;
The survey indicates that there will be increased labor market demand for&#13;
industrial/technical and managerial skills, but whether employers will hire pre-service&#13;
VET trainees for these skills, or attempt to train existing or new, unqualified workers&#13;
through in-service training, is not clear.  A critical factor in employers' decision-&#13;
making will be the quality of VET graduates and the extent to which pre-service&#13;
training is adapted to their needs.&#13;
In conclusion, the labor market demand justification for expanded VET capacity in&#13;
Bamako is difficult to establish through this study at this time, given the low quality of&#13;
VET trainees and the lack of communication between training institutes and&#13;
employers. On the other hand, there appears to be a justification for improving VET&#13;
quality and adaptation to employer needs. To improve the quality of training it will be&#13;
important to upgrade vocational training programs, instructors, equipment, teaching&#13;
materials, etc., and to limit student orientation to enrollment capacity. Meanwhile, the&#13;
establishment of business relations between vocational training instructors and&#13;
employers for the development of enterprise training programs should considerable&#13;
improve VET responsiveness to employer needs.&#13;

Study 6: Analysis of the Annual Declaration of Manpower Surveys, 1991-1993&#13;
Methodology&#13;
The Annual Manpower Declaration (DAMO) is carried out each year by the&#13;
Statistics and Information Division of the National Manpower and Employment Office.&#13;
It is sent out to all modem sector enterprises (public, private and parastatal) and covers&#13;
the structure of skills and qualifications by firm and economnic sector; the salary&#13;
structure of firms, according to qualifications, gender and nationality; employment of&#13;
temporary workers; and overall changes in hiring and dismissals, by firm and economic&#13;
sector. In 1993 the DAMO survey covered 650 enterprises, representing 28,600&#13;
permanent workers.&#13;
The problem faced by this survey was lack of resources for analysis and&#13;
dissemination. In 1992 the World Bank provided assistance to the Governrment of&#13;
Mali for the analysis of data collected as part of the DAMO for the years 1988-1990.&#13;
As part of preparation for the VET Consolidation Project, additional support was&#13;
provided for the updatinor of this analysis for the years 1991-1993. This provided the&#13;
preparation team with a consistent data series pertaining to modem labor market&#13;
statistics for the years 1988-1993. This information is the only longitudinal labor&#13;
market information which exists at this time.&#13;
Results&#13;
In 1993 the public sector remained the largest employer, with 42% of salaried&#13;
workers (note that this covered public enterprises, not the civil service). The private&#13;
sector employs 31% of all permanent workers, but represents 74% of all enterprises&#13;
surveyed. The capital, Bamako, provides jobs for 65% of all permanent workers in the&#13;
country. Skilled workers (corresponding to 2- and 4- year VET) make up almost 60%&#13;
of all permanent workers, while 30% have more advanced trainnig and 14% have no&#13;
formal training at all. Fully 90% of all modern sector jobs are occupied by men.&#13;
An analysis of trends in monthly salaries by economic sector and training&#13;
level between 1990 and 1993 sucgests an increasing scarcity of skilled manual labor in&#13;
agro-processing, mining, constrLction, transport and banking industries (See tables at&#13;
the end of this annex). For example, in the construction sector, average salaries for all&#13;
levels of workers increased 26% per year on average between 1990 and 1993, while&#13;
average salaries for skilled manual laborers in the construction industry increased by&#13;
almost 80% per year. In agro-industry, average salaries for all workers rose by 14%&#13;
per year, while those for skilled manual laborers in the same industry increased by&#13;
41%. Similarly, skilled manual laborers in the mining sector increased their salaries by&#13;
40% per year on average. These figures compare most favorably to average annual&#13;
increases in salaries for all levels of workers in all economic sectors over this period&#13;
(6%), and to average salary increases r,r all skilled manual laborers (14%). For&#13;
comparison's sake, skilled workers in commerce saw their salaries decline by an&#13;
average of 12% per year. while those in the utilities sector experienced just 2% annual&#13;
growth over this same period.&#13;

Study 7: Women and Vocational Training: Analysis of Constraints and Needs&#13;
Methodology&#13;
This study attemped to identify the specific constraints faced by women with&#13;
respect to participation in vocational training activities, both formal and nonformal, as&#13;
well as assess women's vocational training needs.&#13;
The initial phase of the study consisted of a full documentary analysis of&#13;
women's vocational training, analysing female enrollment data in formal training&#13;
institutions in Mali, in addition to completing a full review of the international literature&#13;
concerning vocational training, particularly for the informal sector. The second phase&#13;
of this study consisted of a survey of women's vocational training constraints and&#13;
needs among women, primary informal sector training institutes and experts working in&#13;
the public, private and non-profit sectors. The survey reached 200 women, 100 in&#13;
Bamako and 50 in the regional capitals of Segou and Sikasso.&#13;
Results&#13;
The survey identified numerous constraints to women's participation in&#13;
vocational training activities, some of which are shared with men and some of which&#13;
are specific to their status as women.  First off, in the formal vocational training&#13;
system, women constitute just 26% of the total student population, and are enrolled-&#13;
almost exclusively in services sector training (office and secretarial skills, accounting,&#13;
administration, etc.). Females make up less than 5% of student enrollment in industrial&#13;
skills training, which is the most promising area for employment growth in the near&#13;
future. Low female participation in formal VET is related to low participation in basic&#13;
education, where girls make up just one-third of all students, and where girl's&#13;
enrollment is estimated at just 25% nationwide.&#13;
Limited access to formal training means most women who find work do so in&#13;
the informal sector, and must seek out nonformal training opportunities to improve&#13;
their skills. Again, women face severe constraints. The high cost of training (relative&#13;
to their monthly earnings in the informal sector) is major factor, followed closely by&#13;
the lack of time available for training. Women who work full-time, with families who&#13;
expect them to simultaneously fulfill their "normal domestic responsibilities"(cooking,&#13;
cleaning, child-rearing, etc.) simply do not have the time and energy to participate in&#13;
most training activities. The distance to training centers is another factor, as many&#13;
women do not want (or are forbidden) to travel alone, particularly in the evening.&#13;
Finally, many husbands object to their wives' participation in training, for a variety of&#13;
economic, social and cultural reasons.&#13;
In terms of training neeeds, women identified technical skills/crafts training&#13;
('techniques artisanales') as most important, followed by training in management,&#13;
accounting and marketing. Equally important, almost all women expressed the need&#13;
for basic literacy and numeracy training, as the vast majority of working women have&#13;
never been to school and remain illiterate.&#13;
&#13;

Interpretation of Results&#13;
From the outset of their lives, females confont unequal access to education and&#13;
training, which continues as they grow older. Special efforts are required to ensure the&#13;
participation of women in vocational training activities, both formal or nonformal. It is&#13;
particularly important to expand outreach activities to women's groups to inform&#13;
women of training opportunities and explain how to participate in them. This training&#13;
must be adapted to women's educational levels, to their daily working lives in the&#13;
informal sector, and to their hours of 'free time"1 It would be better to promote the&#13;
development of numerous, small training facilities which are close to women's homes&#13;
than the creation of large, centralized training facilities which are too far away to&#13;
permit women's participation.&#13;

Mali's Labor Code&#13;
The adoption of Mali's revised labor code in September 1992 provides a more transparent&#13;
framework for the operation of labor markets. The transparency has been achieved by&#13;
introducing deadlines in enforcement procedures, which, in principal, would reduce the&#13;
uncertainty facing employers regarding planned personnel action, and by establishing limits&#13;
on damages that can be assessed for violations of the code. Prior uncertainty regarding the&#13;
period of time require for approval of personnel actions by labor inspectors added to the&#13;
expected cost of labor and reduced the incentive for employment creation. Steps have been&#13;
taken in the revised labor code to reduce this uncertainty for employers, while retaining&#13;
due process procedures for such actions as individual or collective dismissals.&#13;
The code contains a number of features that enhance flexibility in the use of labor as a&#13;
resource. Fixed-term contracts are legal as is part-time employment (Art. 133) in the face&#13;
of economic downturns. Premiums paid for overtime are low by international standards&#13;
(Art. 137). These features of the labor code enable employers to adjust labor costs in&#13;
response to economic shocks and are favorable to employment growth. From an&#13;
institutional perspective, the monopoly on job placement held by the state has been&#13;
removed and the entry of private placement agencies is permitted (Art. 303). The&#13;
competition this provides to the National Manpower Office (Office National de Ia Main-&#13;
d'oeuvre et de l'Emploi) will improve labor intermediation.&#13;
Against this favorable background of reforms, there remain a number of features in labor&#13;
code that act as impediments to labor tiexibility and add to labor's cost. More important&#13;
perhaps is the uncertainty that exists in the present environment regarding implementation&#13;
of the revised labor code. Covering the impediments first, fixed-term contracts are&#13;
available as an alternative to continuous or permanent contracts, but fixed-term contracts&#13;
can only be renewed twice, after which the individual must be given a continuous contract&#13;
(Art. 20). The latter brings with it the administrative cost of dismissals. Moreover, the&#13;
fixed-term contract may be offered for a maximum of only two years in contrast to five&#13;
years as found in many countries (Art.2 1). Fixed-term contracts along with reduced hours&#13;
of work, flexible wages, profit-sharing, and sub-contracting have become instruments in&#13;
industrialized countries for achieving labor flexibility; these instruments are not as&#13;
developed as they could be under the revised code..&#13;
Other impediments remain which affect wage tiexibility. Rather than setting an economy-&#13;
wide minimum wage, Mali sets minimum wages for different occupations (Art. 96). This&#13;
adds to the risk of binding minimum wages, which discourages employment creation. In&#13;
addition, seniority benefits are specified in the code (Art. 97), adding to wage rigidity.&#13;
Although the increments mandated do no&amp;#2; appear onerous, they are specified independent of&#13;
productivity gains. Other dispositions intluencing labor cost and employment creation&#13;
involve benefits. Annual leave of 30 days per year after a year of service, including non-&#13;
working days, is high by international standards (Art. 151). Maternity leave for women of&#13;
14 weeks is generous and the number of times it can be used is not restricted (Art. 197),&#13;
which discourages female employment given that Mali has one of the world's highest&#13;
fertility rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
page 2 or 2&#13;
Mali's Labor Code (continued)&#13;
At the same time as the cost of labor is raised for women, women are excluded from night&#13;
work (Art. 186). Labor disputes for individuals and groups, while more transparent, are&#13;
nevertheless encouraged by a labor tribunal process that is free to the plaintiff. No cost&#13;
sharing or risk acceptance is required to discourage frivolous complaints (Art. 202).&#13;
The effect of these measures and others is unclear in the present environment because many&#13;
of the measures require that decrees and ministerial arretes be issued in order to fully&#13;
implement the revised labor code. In fact, the Labor Code makes at least 27 references to&#13;
such decrees and ministerial arretes. Most of these decrees have not yet been issued, in&#13;
part due to opposition from the national unions, and thus, it is difficult to determine what&#13;
impact the revised labor code is having on employment.&#13;
In the final summary, the full effect of any labor code on economic activity and&#13;
employment creation, either positive or negative, depends on its enforcement. In many&#13;
developing countries, enforcement is weak, The uncertainty underlying this enforcement,&#13;
however, remains a factor in the investment decisions of employers. Some measures of&#13;
enforcement might be developed by an enterprise survey inquiring about such matters as&#13;
the difficulty they face in getting permits to hire foreign labor to fill skill shortages, the&#13;
number of labor inspections they have faced dluring the past 12 months, the outcome of&#13;
these inspections and the time and resources required to settle claims, and the number of&#13;
labor disputes that have been taken by employees to conciliation and arbitration.&#13;
As part of the 1995-1997 Policy Framework Paper signed with the International Monetary&#13;
Fund and the World Bank, the Government has agreed to review theimplementation of the&#13;
revised labor code with the aim of identifying further areas of reform to allow more&#13;
flexilibty in the functioning of the labor market. Following this, the legal framework of the&#13;
revised Labor Cocde will be strengthened to ensure full application.&#13;

Vocational Education Consolidation Project&#13;
Project Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation Plan&#13;
1.1   IDA Supervision Input:  Supervision needs are described in Table 1 of this&#13;
Annex. In addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports, terms of reference,&#13;
annual work plans. audits and procurement and disbursement actions, are estimated to&#13;
require 12 staff-weeks during the first year of project execution and 8 staff-weeks of&#13;
various specialists per subsequent year. The supervision of each component, including the&#13;
review of procrement decisions and of progress reports, will be carried out by the task&#13;
manager and procurement specialist under the responsibility of AF5PH.&#13;
1.2   Borrower's Contribution to Supervision&#13;
(a)    Semesterly Progress Reports would be submitted in April and October of&#13;
each project year by the executing agencies, the Component Coordination&#13;
Unit (CCU) and the Vocational Training Support Fund (VTSF). They&#13;
would include a summary of implementation under each project&#13;
component, financial statements on project expenditures, updated project&#13;
implementation and records of contract advertising, bidding, and awards&#13;
with indications of methods of procurement.  The VTSF would also&#13;
indicate the evolution of its financing of informal sector training sub-&#13;
projects,&#13;
(b)   An implenmentation review workshop (annual review), convened by the&#13;
CCU Coordinator in collaboration with the General Director of the VTSF,&#13;
would be held in November of each project year. This would involve the&#13;
participation of all project agencies and donors (the World Bank, the FAC,&#13;

            Mali - Vocational Education and Training
            Consolidation Project

        <abstracts>
            The Vocational Education and Training
            (VET) Consolidation Project aims to contribute to economic
            growth and human resources development, targeting the skill
            requirements of relatively poor urban groups in the informal
            sector. Related objectives are to improve local capacity to
            allocate training resources as a function of labor market
            demand and to increase the involvement of the private sector
            in the management, provision and financing of VET. The
            project will finance three components: a) the consolidation
            of pre-service VET services, by upgrading facilities,
            revising curricula, improving teacher quality and increasing
            management capacity; b) the establishment of a Vocational
            Training Support Fund to develop demand-driven,
            employer-financed skills upgrading and apprenticeship
            training; and c) the establishment of an Employment and
            Training Observatory, to improve labor market information
            analysis and dissemination.
