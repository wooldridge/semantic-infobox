&#13;
                                      I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
 1.      Although the democratic and economic transformation in Albania began later than in&#13;
 other Central and Eastern European countries, the implementation o f the initial phase o f reforms&#13;
 was rapid. GDP grew at about 9 percent per annum inreal terms from 1993 to 1996, inflation&#13;
 was brought down substantially and current account balance and the fiscal deficit improved&#13;
 significantly. Reforms inthe public administrationand financial sectors, however, advanced at a&#13;
much slower pace. By early 1996, structural reforms had stalled, especially inthe critical area o f&#13;
banking, evident in the lack o f progress in resolution o f the problems inthe state-owned banks,&#13;
 and infurther development and enforcement o fbankingregulation and supervision.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The inadequacy o f the financial system, especially its regulatory and supervisory&#13;
 framework, led to the proliferation o f informal financial arrangements including pyramid&#13;
 schemes, the collapse o f whch triggered the civil crisis o f 1997, causing the fall o f the&#13;
government and precipitating new elections. The economic fallout from the crisis was severe,&#13;
with GDP contracting by 7 percent and inflation increasing to over 40 percent in 1997. The&#13;
government, which took office after the elections o f July 1997, quickly re-established&#13;
macroeconomic control and started implementation o f a broad-based program o f reforms in the&#13;
public administration and financial sectors, including institution-building, civil sector reform,&#13;
and divestiture/privatization of state-owned banks. Successive governments maintained this&#13;
commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, with support from the&#13;
internationaldonor community led by IDA and the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The FSAC i s a continuation o f support for the Government o f Albania's financial sector&#13;
reforms as elaborated inthe Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy. It was designed to support&#13;
the implementation o f the final phase o f the State's divestiture from the financial sector and to&#13;
change the State's role from an owner to a regulator. The FSAC supported this transition by&#13;
helping to improve the legal and institutional framework necessary for functioning o f a market&#13;
based financial sector, which i s critical for sustaining the long-term impact o f the structural&#13;
reforms and growth. Reforms outside o f the financial sector were supported by a series o f&#13;
Poverty Reduction Support Credits the first ,of which was approved by the Board at the same&#13;
time as the FSAC.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The implementation o f the FSAC-supportedprogram started well, but faced an early set&#13;
back due to the failed first attempt to privatize the Savings Bank o f Albania, largely due to the&#13;
unfavorable state o f internationalfinancial markets. Progress was, however, made inother areas,&#13;
including in the establishment and operation o f the Deposit Insurance Agency and in the&#13;
strengthening o f banking regulation and supervision. Progress gained further momentum in&#13;
2004, following privatization o f the Savings Bank, which allowed the authorities to refocus their&#13;
energies on other elements o f the program. The Government has met its obligations under the&#13;
FSAC and has indicated its intention to continue with the overall reforms beyond the FSAC&#13;
Closing Date o f December 3I,2004.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           11.    RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 5.     Albania experienced high levels o f economic growth over recent years with real GDP&#13;
growing at an average 7 percent annually over the period 1999-2003. After a slowdown in2002,&#13;
causedby electricity shortages and floods, growth recovered to 6 percent in2003 and i s expected&#13;
to reach the same level in2004. The major contributing factor to the growth momentum was the&#13;
gradual increase in domestic demand. Consumption and investment were supported by growing&#13;
real incomes generated by external flows o f aid, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI).&#13;
The recent pick-up in output growth also resulted from an acceleration in merchandise exports,&#13;
which increased by 25 percent in 2001-2003, with a noted expansion in exports o f textiles and&#13;
footwear. A growing demand for Albania's exports in EU markets contributed to the growth&#13;
momentum over the last two years. Improvements in power supply resulting from favorable&#13;
weather conditions and progress in the restructuring o f the power sector have also helped to&#13;
support output growth.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Low inflation has complemented Albania's good macroeconomic performance, due to the&#13;
BOA'Stight monetary policy. The annual inflation rate has not exceeded the 2-4 percent target&#13;
range since 2002. There has been a steady appreciation o f Albania's national currency (Lek). In&#13;
addition to the tight monetary policy, high volumes o f remittances, large inflows o f external&#13;
financial assistance, and foreign direct investment have contributed to the strengthening o f the&#13;
Lek.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Economic growth i s projected to remain strong in the medium term, with GDP growing&#13;
at an annual rate close to 6 percent on average during 2004-07. Inflation will be maintained in&#13;
its current 2-4 percent target range through sound fiscal and monetarypolicies. The fiscal deficit&#13;
will be reduced to below 5 percent o f GDP in2007. Provided that substantial improvements are&#13;
made inthe business environment, and that the energy sector reforms are pursued, an increase in&#13;
exports and private sector activity i s expected to sustain growth in the next three years. Total&#13;
investment i s expected to reach about 28 percent o f GDP in2007.&#13;
&#13;
8.      The current account deficit i s expected to improve over the medium term. Large public&#13;
and private investment needs suggest, however, that improvements in the current account may&#13;
come only slowly, and would mainly result from further fiscal consolidation. Reforms aimed at&#13;
enhancing the efficiency o f public expenditures and curtailing general subsidies in the utilities&#13;
sector could improve public savings and thus reduce the savings-investment gap. Depending on&#13;
progress in governance and the improvement o f the business climate, sustained FDI inflows&#13;
would keep external debt at moderate levels.&#13;
&#13;
      111.    PROGRESSAGAINST SECOND TRANCHE RELEASE CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
9.      DCA, Section 2.02(d)(i). The progress achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out of&#13;
theProgram is satisfactory to the Association. This conditionhasbeen met.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Although implementation has taken longer than anticipated, satisfactory progress has&#13;
been made in the overall implementation o f the program, thereby meeting the condition o f&#13;
second tranche release. With the recent privatization o f the Savings Bank, Albania boasts a&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 healthy, 100 percent privately owned, competitive banking sector poised to provide improved&#13;
  services to businesses and households Lending to the private sector has been increasing at a&#13;
 healthy rate, with a low level o f non-performing loans. Intermediation increased from Lek 35&#13;
 billion at end-2001 to about Lek 55 billion at end-June 2004. Going forward, intermediation i s&#13;
  expected to expand more rapidly, as, following privatization, the seven-year moratorium on&#13;
  Savings Bank lending has been lifted and the new owners have indicated plans to rapidly&#13;
 increase lending and other banking services. Other major banks are also expected to pursue&#13;
 more aggressive lending activities and newproduct development.&#13;
&#13;
  11.    Inparallel with these developments, the Bank o f Albania has substantially strengthened&#13;
 its supervisory capacity through the implementationo f a more risk-based supervision process. A&#13;
 Deposit Insurance Agency has beenestablished and i s functioning properly. Substantial progress&#13;
 has been made in improving the payments system. The new interbank settlement system for&#13;
 large payments has been fully operational since January 2004 and the fully automated bulk&#13;
 clearing systemi s expected to be completed by mid-2005. Inaddition, efforts are well underway&#13;
 to strengthen the legal framework for bankruptcy and secured transactions and a collateral&#13;
 registry for movableproperty has been functioning well for over three years. Efforts have gained&#13;
 momentum in addressing the insurance regulation and supervision and satisfactory new&#13;
 legislation has been approved by Parliament and enacted per Presidential decree on December&#13;
  16,2004.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     DCA, Section 2.02(d)(ii).    The macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower is&#13;
 satisfactory, as measured on the basis o f indicators agreed between the Borrower and the&#13;
 Association. This conditionhas beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
 13.     The IMF approved a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program&#13;
in June 2002, to assist Albania in maintaining macroeconomic stability and financial&#13;
 sustainability.  The IMF's structural conditionality focuses on three main categories: fiscal&#13;
management and control; payments discipline; and privatization. The Government has a good&#13;
track record in maintaining macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal and monetary&#13;
policies, as confirmed by the latest IMFreview inAugust 2004.&#13;
&#13;
 14.    DCA, Schedule 2, Para I. The Borrower has signed a contract with strategic investor(s)&#13;
to finalize the sale o f at least 50 percent plus one share of the Savings Bank o f the Borrower.&#13;
This conditionhas beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The contract for the sale o f 100 percent o f the Savings Bank o f Albania to Raiffeisen&#13;
Zentralbank Austria was signed in January 2004, and the final handover o f the Savings Bank&#13;
took place in April 2004. The privatization process went smoothly and benefited from the&#13;
commitment and cooperation o f all parties involved. This sale was the biggest privatization to&#13;
date in Albanian history and the revenues from the sale provided an important boost to the State&#13;
budget. I t was successful not only from the point o f view o f price, but also since the new owner&#13;
i s a major, reputable European bank whose presence in Albania would increase competition and&#13;
provision o f better banking to the business community, as well as households. The new owners&#13;
have already begun to invest substantially in IT improvements, and development o f new&#13;
corporate and consumer products, including lending andpayments services.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 16.     DCA, Schedule 2, Para 2. The Borrower has established its Deposit Insurance Agency&#13;
 and made satisfactory progress in implementation o f its financing program. This conditionhas&#13;
 beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     The Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA, "Agency") was established under the Deposit&#13;
 Insurance Law which became effective on October 18, 2002. The model o f deposit insurance&#13;
 agency inAlbania i s the so called "payment box" where the functions o f the Agency are limited&#13;
 to collection o f admission contributions and annual premiums, the prudent management of the&#13;
 assets, and the prompt reimbursement o f insured depositors in case o f a bank failure. With 13&#13;
 employees, including the Managing Director, the DIA i s adequately staffed and appropriate rules&#13;
 and procedures are inplace for its effective operation. An initial capital o f Lek 400 million was&#13;
provided from the State budget. In addition, member banks paid a one time admission fee and&#13;
pay an annual premium of 0.5 percent o f insured deposits towards further capitalization of the&#13;
 DIA. By June 2004, the total accumulated assets were about Lek 1.7 billion, representing a&#13;
 fund-to-insured deposit ratio o f about 1.1 percent. Given the generally healthy state of the&#13;
banking sector inAlbania, it i s envisaged that there will be no major demands on these funds and&#13;
that the total assets o f the DIA will, over time, reach the prudent 5 percent ratio prescribedby the&#13;
Deposit Insurance Law. The 3-year financing plan for DIA, including the investment guidelines&#13;
 and the operating budget, has been approved and i s being implemented satisfactorily.          The&#13;
investmentpolicy, management o f financial assets, and conduct o f administrative expenses o fthe&#13;
agency are very conservative as prescribedby the Deposit Insurance Law.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     DCA, Schedule2, Para 3. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress inimplementing&#13;
its Supervisory Development Plan (SDP) for banking supervision. This condition has been&#13;
met.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Fulfillmentof this condition has been assessed based onthe agreed indicators established&#13;
to measure compliance with the SDP. The SDP was adopted by the BOAon March 13, 2002,&#13;
prior to Board presentation o f the Credit, and sets out the BOA'Slong-term strategy and&#13;
institutional development program for banking supervision. An overall mission statement which&#13;
captures the overarching goal o f banking supervision was approved by BOA. A Supervisory&#13;
Operating Policy, outlining and discussing the method o f bank supervision, and its roll-out over&#13;
the course o f a supervisory cycle, has also been approved. Supervisory strategies have been&#13;
prepared for all banks and have become increasingly robust.             Risk analysis, management&#13;
evaluations, and supervisory plans have improved in quality and comprehensiveness. BOA'S&#13;
communication and dialogue with the banking industry and extemal auditors has improved. The&#13;
initial implementation o f a more risk based, ongoing supervision process i s timely given the&#13;
current stage (expected increased intermediation) o f banking system evolution.&#13;
&#13;
20.      The SDP i s designed to be a living document that guides longer-term process&#13;
development. Therefore, the BOAhas indicated that while meaningful compliance with the SDP&#13;
has been achieved, it intends to continue efforts to implement the SDP and improve supervision&#13;
beyond the FSAC as part of its long-term goals.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 21.     DCA, Schedule2, Para 4. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress inimplementing&#13;
 the InstitutionalDevelopment Program (IDP) for bankruptcy enforcement and secured financing.&#13;
 This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
 22.     Fulfillment o f this condition has been assessed based on two sets o f agreed indicators: (a)&#13;
 completion o f no less than three pilot cases to test the operation o f the IDP framework; and (b)&#13;
 fulfillment o f indicators specified in the IDP. The IDP was approved on April 30, 2002 by the&#13;
 Ministry of Finance and the Ministryof Justice, prior to Board presentation of the Credit, and&#13;
 sets out a program for improving enforcement o f insolvency and secured financing legislation.&#13;
&#13;
 23.     The authorities have met this condition by providing evidence o f three cases which have&#13;
 been successfully concluded using the Secured Transaction Law. The satisfactory&#13;
 implementation o f the IDP hinged on availability o f donor financing which despite&#13;
 understandings did not materialize. Therefore, implementation was initially delayed but has&#13;
 recently picked up momentum.            A working group was established early on to oversee&#13;
 implementation o f the IDP. This group includes members from the Ministries o f Finance and&#13;
 Justice, as well as management o f the Magistrate School. An insolvency manual has been&#13;
 completed with World Bank Group grant funding. Based on this, manual training materials for&#13;
judicial seminars on the insolvency law have been prepared, and, inDecember 2004, a first set o f&#13;
judges have received training on liquidation and reorganization. The training material will be&#13;
 used by the magistrate school to develop a curriculum that will become a standard part of its&#13;
program for trainingjudges. The IDP i s a long-term tool and its implementationwas designed to&#13;
 continue beyond the Closing Date o f the FSAC. To this end, the authorities have reached&#13;
agreement with a bilateral donor for public dissemination o f the insolvency manual and the&#13;
provision o f training for bankruptcy administrators.      This will be an important element o f&#13;
continuing the implementation o f the IDP.&#13;
&#13;
24.      DCA, Schedule 2, Para 5. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress inimplementing&#13;
a strategic and business plan for the Bank Asset Resolution Trust (BART), including resolution&#13;
o f at least 15 percent invalue o f its portfolio. This conditionhas beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Fulfillment o f this condition has been assessed based on figures provided to IDA by the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance at Negotiations, adjusted to reflect the figures in BART's 2003 financial&#13;
statements. The adjustments made reflect the value of the actual transfer o f the Savings Bank&#13;
portfolio, and reduce the amount o f the portfolio originally transferred from Lek 21 billion to&#13;
Lek 19.8billion. The 2003 IASaudit report reflectsthe exact amount.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Since early 2003, BART has made substantial progress in implementing the agreed&#13;
business and strategic plan. This includes structural and organizational changes, improved&#13;
procedures, and the introduction o f a "Global Scheme" for divestiture o f its assets. BART&#13;
continues to implement the Global Scheme and good progress i s being made in collection and&#13;
divestiture activities. During the last few years, BART has collected about Lek 2.9 billion in&#13;
cash which has contributed to the Government's general revenue. Inregard to divestiture, as o f&#13;
October 2004, a total o f Lek 7.8 billion, representing 39.4 percent o f the adjusted value o f the&#13;
transferred portfolio (or 37.1 percent o f the earlier reported amount o f Lek 21 billion), was&#13;
divested in a transparent manner and associated claims have been removed from BART's books.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.       In addition, about 44 percent o f the portfolio has been submitted to the courts for&#13;
resolution.    BART'Ssuccess inworking out claims and enforcing its rights as a creditor has had&#13;
a positive impact on the development o f a credit culture that was previously lacking. One&#13;
indicator o f this i s the very low level o f non-performing loans being reported by the banking&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
28.      DCA, Schedule 2, Para 6. Satisfactory insurance legislation has been enacted. This&#13;
conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
29.      New Laws on Insurance, Reinsurance and Brokers and on the Operation o f the Insurance&#13;
Supervisory Agency (ISA) were approved by Parliament and enacted into law by Presidential&#13;
decree in September 2004. For the most part, these two laws substantially comply with the&#13;
minimum requirements of modem good practice. However, four key areas of the Law on&#13;
Insurance and Reinsurance needed to be amended to make the law satisfactory to IDA. These&#13;
amendments, which related to reinsurance qualifications, fit and proper rules for owners and&#13;
management o f insurance companies, allowing foreign representation on management and&#13;
supervisory boards, and limitations on the general manager's ownership stake in an insurance&#13;
company, were approved by Parliament and enacted into law by Presidentialdecree inDecember&#13;
2004.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Substantial improvement has been made in the development and use o f basic financial&#13;
and statistical reports, and the ISA has been using these for corrective action purposes.&#13;
However, there i s a need to develop more comprehensive statistical reporting so that technical&#13;
reserves and solvency can be monitored by ISA. Inregard to the Third Party Liability system&#13;
(TPL), an actuarially basedpremiumrating system establishing transparent guidelines for setting&#13;
premiums and reserving for TPL insurance was introduced. However, compliance with the&#13;
regulations i s weak. To remedy this situation and further strengthen supervision o f insurance&#13;
companies, the Minister o f Finance has issued orders (regulations) to enforce prudent&#13;
reinsurance practices and steps have been initiated to review the entire TPL system with a view&#13;
to implementing long-term reforms and improving enforcement. With the above amendments&#13;
and ministerial regulations, the insurance legislationi s satisfactory to IDA&#13;
&#13;
31.      DCA, Schedule 2, Para 7. The Borrower has established an insurance regulatory agency&#13;
with budgetary and operational independence. This conditionhas been met.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The Law on the Operation of the Insurance Supervisory Agency (ISA, formerly known as&#13;
the Albanian Insurance Supervisory Commission - AISC) i s in line with relevant requirements&#13;
o f the Intemational Association o f Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) in regard to budgetary and&#13;
operational independence. The ISA Supervisory Council, working with the State Audit Bureau,&#13;
has signed off on a business plan for the next two years. Inaddition, the Ministryo f Finance has&#13;
provided written confirmation that arrangements will be put inplace to ensure adequate funding&#13;
o f the ISA, incompliance with the Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       IV.     CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
33.      Inview ofthe overall performance andprogress with the implementationof the program&#13;
supported by the Credit, and incompliance with the specific conditions o f release as described in&#13;
Section 2.02 (d) and Schedule 2 to the DCA, the Bank has informed the Borrower o f the&#13;
availability of the second tranche o f SDR 6 million.&#13;

            Albania - Financial Sector Adjustment
            Credit Project - release of the second tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit
            Project (FSAC) continues the support to Albania's
            financial sector reforms as elaborated in the Growth and
            Poverty Reduction Strategy. Designed to support the
            implementation of the final phase of the State's
            divestiture from the financial sector, and to change the
            State's role from an owner to a regulator, the project
            supports this transition by improvements to the legal and
            institutional framework, necessary for functioning of a
            market based financial sector, and so critical for
            sustaining the long-term impact of the structural reforms
            and growth. In view of the overall performance and progress
            with the implementation of the program supported by the
            Credit, and in full compliance with the specific conditions
            of release as described in Section 2.02 (d) and Schedule 2
            of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the second
            tranche is released.
