&#13;
&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Country Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Following the recent parliamentary elections in Iraq ­ only the second democratic&#13;
election process in the last 30 years ­ the country is at a crucial juncture for its future economic&#13;
and social development. While precise figures are lacking, it is estimated that nearly 10 percent of&#13;
the population lives on less than US$1 per day, with another 30 percent vulnerable to falling into&#13;
this category. Up to a quarter of the Iraqi population depends on monthly food rations through the&#13;
Public Distribution System (PDS). Unemployment and underemployment are anywhere between&#13;
25 and 60 percent, depending on the estimate and definition, all indicating most severity among&#13;
youth. Two decades of intermittent conflict have produced large numbers of disadvantaged and&#13;
vulnerable groups. Providing adequate social protection mechanisms for the poor and vulnerable,&#13;
including social safety nets and affordable pensions, is important in its own right and is critical to&#13;
the implementation of broader economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Beginning in late August 2005, the Interim Government adopted an ambitious reform-&#13;
focused fiscal strategy, including, inter alia, reducing some commodity subsidies, particularly&#13;
relating to petroleum products and strengthening the social safety net in order to offset the impact&#13;
of future price increases on the poor.&#13;
&#13;
3.       In part to counter the effects of higher prices on the poor, the Government has allocated&#13;
ID 500 billion (US$330 million equivalent) in 2006 to strengthen the existing targeted cash-based&#13;
safety net program administered by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA).&#13;
Resources for the program will come from a reduction in the PDS budget, the nation's primary&#13;
social safety net providing universal in-kind food transfers. Savings are expected primarily&#13;
through improved administrative control over procurement. The reduction also signals a longer-&#13;
term shift away from in-kind subsidies toward targeted cash transfer assistance mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
4.       A parallel and related development involves pension policy. There is concern from both&#13;
the Government and international donors, led by the International Monitoring Fund (IMF) and the&#13;
World Bank, that the mandatory pension system is accumulating large and unsustainable pension&#13;
liabilities. In addition, a new civil service pension law (Law No. 27) has been passed which&#13;
would provide even more generous pension benefits. Implementing the law, however, would&#13;
increase pension payments across the board ­ by some estimates doubling expenditures. The&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOLSA have established a Pension Reform Steering Committee&#13;
(PRSC), chaired by the MOF, which has requested the Council of Ministers to delay the&#13;
implementation of the law until the formation of the new government. The Government therefore&#13;
has a strong interest in designing and implementing a new pension system that reduces current&#13;
expenditures and improves coverage and long term sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
&#13;
5.       Reform of subsidies and pensions has potentially huge consequences for the poor. How&#13;
alternative safety net mechanisms and pensions are designed and implemented will be critical to&#13;
the success of the overall economic reform effort in Iraq, both in welfare and political economy&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The existing information base is insufficient to support social protection policy reforms.&#13;
Designing safety nets and pension systems that meet basic norms in terms of efficiency, equity&#13;
and financial sustainability requires detailed information on program costs and beneficiaries.&#13;
Unfortunately, information systems in Iraq are severely underdeveloped. There is currently no&#13;
comprehensive database of safety net program recipients or of contributors to and beneficiaries of&#13;
the pension system.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Cash-based safety nets have been small and not well-targeted to the poorest. The&#13;
dominant safety net in Iraq is the PDS, accounting for more than 14 percent of GDP in 2005. The&#13;
incidence of benefits would be expected to be virtually neutral between poor and non poor since&#13;
the ration is uniformly available, with the lack targeting both raising the cost of the PDS and&#13;
limiting the concentration of resources on the very poor. Other safety nets, including the cash-&#13;
transfer based mechanisms administered by MOLSA, are small in comparison, roughly 2 percent&#13;
of GDP.1 In the context of scaling up the Social Safety Net (SSN) program, MOLSA has revised&#13;
the payment structure of the program with technical assistance from USAID, with an expectation&#13;
that over 1 million families would receive benefits by the end of 2006. Good progress has been&#13;
made soliciting applications, with about 429,000 applications received by the beginning of April&#13;
2006. However, targeting criteria have not fundamentally changed from the older program and&#13;
there has been no assessment of how MOLSA will cope with the enlarged administrative burden.&#13;
Scaling up the SSN program effectively remains a huge challenge.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The current pension system is financially unsustainable, benefit formulas and eligibility&#13;
conditions do not respect basic norms in terms of design, and coverage is limited. Iraq has two&#13;
earning-related pension systems, one for civil servants and one for private sector workers,&#13;
covering approximately 15 percent of the labor force. Beginning in April 2003, the Coalition&#13;
Provisional Authority replaced regular pensions with emergency "flat" payments to cope with the&#13;
depreciation of the Iraqi Dinar and resolve problems related to individual records that emerged&#13;
following the armed conflict. Flat payments are estimated to cost around 5 percent of GDP,&#13;
among the highest level in the region, and are being financed from the general budget. The&#13;
Government is now under pressure to implement the new civil service pension law passed in&#13;
December 2005 (Law 27/2005), that would bring expenditures from about 5-5% to between 4.5-&#13;
7% of GDP. However, implementing the more generous pension formulas is not a feasible option&#13;
in the long run, as the system design compromises financial sustainability, damages incentives,&#13;
and opens the door to adverse distributional transfers. The Bank's advice is to stop the&#13;
implementation of the new civil servants law and focus as an immediate priority on developing a&#13;
new law that meets minimum design standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1 Additional programs include: (i) cash transfers of ID 375 billion provided to the approximately 300,000&#13;
demobilized military personnel under the Demobilization and Reintegration Program; (ii) the previous&#13;
Social Safety Net program, given as a monthly cash transfer, regardless of family size, to those unable to&#13;
work, including those with children; and (iii) in-kind assistance provided to about 6,300 individuals,&#13;
primarily through approximately 130 facilities maintained by MOLSA, including orphanages, institutes for&#13;
the disabled, cooperative workshops and homes for the elderly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.       Administrative and institutional capacity to implement reforms is weak. Despite strong&#13;
efforts to provide services and assistance under extremely difficult conditions, the lack of&#13;
institutional capacity remains a major weakness. MOLSA has only recently begun to reassert its&#13;
position as the lead institution for government-provided social protection policy and services.&#13;
Administration and management of programs must be strengthened, along with the capacity to&#13;
analyze and develop sector policy. Facilities and other infrastructure are insufficient to support a&#13;
major scaling up of services, despite assistance from donors. Further, pension records maintained&#13;
by the MOF and MOLSA are not complete and do not capture adequate information essential for&#13;
financial projections and policy design.&#13;
&#13;
Government Strategy and Donor Involvement&#13;
&#13;
10.      National Development Strategy. In July 2005, the Iraqi Transitional Government&#13;
presented a National Development Strategy (NDS) aimed at placing Iraq on a course toward a&#13;
diversified market-based economy. The strategy focuses on good governance, private sector-led&#13;
growth, and strong social safety nets. The four pillars of the NDS are: (i) strengthening the&#13;
foundations of economic growth; (ii) revitalizing the private sector; (iii) improving the quality of&#13;
life through, among other things, investing in the social sectors; and (iv) strengthening good&#13;
governance and improving security. The NDS gives priority in the short terms to restoring basic&#13;
services and creating employment. Although donors pledged US$32 billion at the International&#13;
Conference for Iraq in Madrid in October 2003, continued lack of security has complicated&#13;
delivery of donor assistance and lessened its impact on the ground. At the Iraq International&#13;
Conference in Brussels in June 2005, donors were urged to find ways to expedite project&#13;
implementation and, if necessary, to re-allocate funds to faster disbursing activities. Donors have&#13;
deposited about US$1 billion in the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI),&#13;
which consists of two trust funds, one administered by the World Bank and another by the United&#13;
Nations. Nearly all donor deposits to IRFFI have been allocated to projects that are ongoing.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Government Strategy for Social Protection. The GOI has begun to develop social&#13;
protection policies that are consistent with the NDS. In particular, for 2006, MOLSA has placed&#13;
priority on expanding and implementing programs targeted to the poor. In particular it is: (i)&#13;
putting in place a social safety net program to reach 1 million needy families by the end of 2006;&#13;
(ii) rehabilitating employment and training centers with a goal of re-training some 20,000&#13;
individuals during 2005-06; (ii) rehabilitating social service centers and increasing assistance to&#13;
the poor unemployed and former military and their families; and. (iii) finalizing the draft labor&#13;
code governing working conditions and general terms of employment. In addition, pension&#13;
reform continues to be a top concern of both MOLSA and MOF. A new civil service pension law&#13;
has been approved by the Transition Government which will adversely impact implicit liabilities&#13;
and fiscal sustainability (Law No. 27). However, longer term policy development and strategic&#13;
planning remains limited. The World Bank is providing technical assistance to GOI and&#13;
specifically MOLSA to formulate an integrated social protection strategy incorporating labor&#13;
market programs, safety nets, and broad old-age pension policy. This effort complements the&#13;
current project and the companion World Bank project "Strengthening Policy Making for Poverty&#13;
Reduction, Employment Generation and Safety Net Development."&#13;
&#13;
12.      Partnerships with Other Donors and Stakeholders. The project will involve key&#13;
donors and Government stakeholders throughout implementation. The key donors involved in&#13;
supporting social protection in Iraq are USAID, DFID and the UN, including the World Food&#13;
Program (WFP) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) (see Annex 8). Of these, USAID&#13;
has been most directly engaged with MOLSA in providing policy advice and supporting the&#13;
design of the revised Social Safety Net Program. WFP has played a role in studying food security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and food markets in relation to reform options of the PDS subsidy, while the ILO has&#13;
concentrated on capacity building in labor market issues. DFID supports the coordination of&#13;
reform efforts motivated by the Stand-By Agreement with the IMF through the Economic&#13;
Support Project (ESP), and to that end provides policy guidance on safety net issues in the&#13;
context of subsidy reform in close coordination with the Bank. Both USAID and DFID have a&#13;
limited physical presence in Baghdad, which has facilitated the development of the proposed&#13;
project. They welcome the involvement of the World Bank in supporting the policy development&#13;
effort on both safety nets and pensions and are ready to partner with the Bank by using their&#13;
presence on the ground to facilitate policy dialogue and implementation of Bank-financed&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The coordination between the Bank and the set of key donors has been and is expected to&#13;
remain productive. Regular discussion and updates of conditions in Iraq are held, and information&#13;
has been exchanged on mutual policy advice and program activities. Donors have been included&#13;
in most policy and capacity building training activities sponsored by the Bank, and the Bank has&#13;
helped to identify potential consultants for DFID's ESP. Donor expertise will be sought where&#13;
relevant and expedient in the execution of the proposed project, and DFID is placing a consultant&#13;
in Baghdad to support the project.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Other Government stakeholders will play an important role in the project. The MOF is&#13;
intimately involved in budget and policy decisions both with respect to safety nets and to&#13;
pensions, and will benefit from capacity building for policy development. Similarly, MOPDC and&#13;
other ministries and agencies with a role in policy design will be consulted on issues of interest.&#13;
&#13;
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
15.      The World Bank Second Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Iraq was presented to the&#13;
Bank's Board of Executive Directors in September 2005. The strategy builds on the achievements&#13;
of the First ISN, and is aligned with the Iraqi Transitional Government's NDS. The Bank's&#13;
overarching objective is to help Iraq build efficient, inclusive, transparent and accountable&#13;
institutions as needed for stability, good governance, and sustainable economic prosperity. Better&#13;
institutional frameworks, policies and systems will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
both national expenditures and international aid. The proposed project is fully consistent with the&#13;
Bank's Second ISN. The project's two components address three of the Second ISN's four pillars,&#13;
namely: (i) restoring basic services delivery (Pillar 1); (ii) strengthening the social safety nets&#13;
(Pillar 3) and public sector governance (Pillar 4).&#13;
&#13;
16.      The strategy relies on the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and IDA to finance projects,&#13;
and on the Bank budget for the economic and sector work and policy advice that is needed. The&#13;
ITF is currently financing ten projects for US$385 million, nine of which are still under&#13;
implementation. The World Bank is one of the few donors that finance recipient-executed&#13;
projects. The vast majority of donor-financed projects in Iraq have been implemented by the&#13;
donor agencies, consulting firms or NGOs on behalf of the Government. A major benefit of&#13;
recipient execution, apart from greater ownership and sustainability, is the institutional capacity&#13;
building that is developed through project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
17.     The World Bank is responding to a direct request from the Minister of Labor and Social&#13;
Affairs in October 2005, followed up by an official letter in January, 2006, for support in social&#13;
safety net and pension reform design and implementation processes within the context of the&#13;
Government's NDS. The MOLSA, the MOF and the Bank see the proposed project as the first&#13;
phase of a longer term Bank engagement to tackle the key issues outlined above, and to help the&#13;
government move towards the implementation of a fiscally sustainable social protection system.&#13;
The ultimate goal is to provide vulnerable populations with the support they need to sustain&#13;
themselves and to springboard back into economic activity where possible, and to reform the&#13;
pension system using benefit formulas and eligibility conditions that respect basic norms in terms&#13;
of design, expansion of coverage and fiscal sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The proposed project builds on Bank engagement with the Government and MOLSA in&#13;
particular over the past 18 months in providing technical assistance and capacity building on&#13;
social protection. This has included a policy note on social protection, covering safety net, labor&#13;
market, and pension issues, together with a series of policy workshops involving major&#13;
stakeholders within government (MOF, MOPDC, Ministry of Defense and others) as well as&#13;
international donors. In addition, the Bank is supporting the preparation of a social protection&#13;
strategy under the direction of MOLSA with inputs from other government stakeholders. The&#13;
request for more in-depth support in safety nets and pensions is therefore a natural extension of&#13;
the ongoing relationship. In addition, strengthening social safety net and pension reform design&#13;
and implementation processes will contribute directly to helping the Government implement its&#13;
NDS.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The project will also complement the "Strengthening Policy Making for Poverty&#13;
Reduction, Employment Generation and Safety Net Development" project (SPM) also under&#13;
preparation by the Bank. The primary focus of the SPM project is to conduct a household&#13;
expenditure survey and a poverty assessment based on analysis of this data; and a poverty and&#13;
social impact analysis report. The SPM project will also involve a multi agency effort on the GOI&#13;
side supported by the Bank to produce a poverty reduction, employment and SSN strategy as an&#13;
output. In contrast, this project will focus on building technical capacity within the MOLSA so&#13;
that MOLSA can contribute to the development of the overall SSN strategy and to making&#13;
operational the new programs for which it is responsible. It will also similarly support the MOF&#13;
and its State Pension System (SPS) organization on the pensions side.&#13;
&#13;
20.     The Bank has a comparative advantage relative to other donor institutions in social&#13;
protection, given both the ongoing Iraq involvement and the program experience accrued in a&#13;
variety of country settings in and outside of the region. Economic sector work and projects in&#13;
safety nets have been carried out in most countries in MENA, including difficult post-conflict&#13;
settings such as the West Bank and Gaza. Pension assistance has been provided to these same&#13;
countries, typically involving design and assessment of reform options. Experience from outside&#13;
the region will also inform the capacity building and advice, customized to the Iraq context and in&#13;
partnership with the Government.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Lessons Learned from Prior Operations. The World Bank has now had active projects in&#13;
Iraq for two years. Together with projects in other conflict-affected regions, including&#13;
Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the West Bank and Gaza, a number of important lessons&#13;
derived from these recent experiences are reflected in the design of this project, namely:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Technical assistance projects are difficult to implement successfully. Therefore, the&#13;
       project should be limited in scope and have a very simple design that can be quickly and&#13;
       visibly implemented;&#13;
    · The project should be part of a programmatic framework based on a needs assessment&#13;
       and close collaboration with other donors;&#13;
    · In situations where international Bank team members cannot be on the ground directly&#13;
       supervising the project, it is essential to rely on local Bank consultants, with adequate&#13;
       intensive training in Bank procedures and practices, to carry out the supervision of the&#13;
       project activities;&#13;
    · If many donor organizations are involved in the country's recovery process, it is&#13;
       important for the implementing agency to have an effective coordinating mechanism in&#13;
       place to ensure complementarities of donor support. In addition, the Bank should&#13;
       maintain frequent and effective collaboration with involved development partners.&#13;
&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
22.    The overall objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the policy, management and&#13;
administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension and Social&#13;
Safety Net (SSN) reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be&#13;
implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final outcomes. One&#13;
intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information&#13;
generated by the new systems for social safety net and pension decision making.&#13;
&#13;
23.    Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following outcomes:&#13;
&#13;
    · Establishment of a basic information system within MOLSA to record and process&#13;
       information on safety nets as a foundation for policy design;&#13;
    · Consolidation and expansion of the information base for the SSN program managed by&#13;
       MOLSA to permit development of targeting strategies;&#13;
    · Design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for the expanded SSN&#13;
       program;&#13;
    · Development of an updated digitized database on beneficiaries, contributors and&#13;
       employers in the pension system;&#13;
    · Building of technical capacity within MOLSA and MOF for policy analysis and design in&#13;
       the area of safety net and pensions; and&#13;
    · Development of a draft pension reform strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description&#13;
&#13;
24.    The proposed project will support two areas of social protection ­ safety nets and&#13;
pensions ­ and will comprise three components.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Safety Nets (estimated total cost US$6.36 million). This component will have&#13;
two subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
25.    Subcomponent A: Information Systems Development. This subcomponent of the project&#13;
will support: (i) supply and installation of IT systems and equipment to assist in scaling up the&#13;
SSN Program; (ii) establishing a basic information infrastructure within MOLSA, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development of an integrated database of safety net applicants and beneficiaries; and (iii)&#13;
developing a monitoring and evaluation system for the program based on a central management&#13;
information system (MIS).&#13;
&#13;
26.      Subcomponent B: Institutional Capacity Building for Safety Nets Policy Development.&#13;
This subcomponent will focus on three areas of safety nets policy: (i) capacity building in data&#13;
analysis and program monitoring; (ii) development of sustainable safety net program designs that&#13;
can replace generalized subsidies; and (iii) targeting and eligibility options. Activities would&#13;
include technical assistance and training for MOLSA staff inside Iraq as well as in other countries&#13;
within and beyond the region to acquire needed skills.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Pensions (estimated total cost US$ 0.81 million).&#13;
&#13;
27.      This component will finance the preparation of baseline information and IT support for&#13;
record-keeping and policy analysis. It will include: (i) conducting a representative survey of&#13;
beneficiaries and contributors to the SPS; (ii) providing IT technologies to support digitization of&#13;
pension records, record-keeping, and pension policy analysis; (iii) training on data entry, database&#13;
management (record-keeping), and data analysis for pension policy making.&#13;
&#13;
28.      As a complement to this component, the Bank will finance Institutional Capacity&#13;
Building for Pension Policy Development. This would fund the preparation of a short term policy&#13;
note assessing options for the MOF on how to address the negative fiscal effects of the recently&#13;
approved Pension Law #27 together with a policy workshop for the PRSC, and technical support&#13;
to underpin their drafting of a revised pension law. Over the medium term it will provide&#13;
technical assistance and training to improve the capacity of MOLSA and MOF staff in the&#13;
following areas of pension policy: (i) evaluation of system design (including assessment of&#13;
financial sustainability and fiscal implications); (ii) pension system management and&#13;
administration; and (iii) pension reform design for public mandatory systems, including the&#13;
preparation of a draft strategy for pension reform and the assessment of fiscal and welfare&#13;
implications of the reform. Activities would include consultant studies and training for selected&#13;
staff from MOLSA and MOF in pension design and financial modeling.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Project Management (estimated total cost US$0.83 million).&#13;
&#13;
29.      This component is to finance goods, technical assistance, training and operating&#13;
expenditures necessary to manage project activities and ensure compliance with the grant&#13;
fiduciary requirements.&#13;
&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
30.      Project Duration. Although the MOLSA and MOF will work on an accelerated schedule&#13;
to have all project activities implemented as soon as possible, the project's implementation&#13;
schedule (Annex 7) reflects a more cautious approach to take into account the risks outlined in&#13;
Section F, and assumes that the ITF termination date (currently set at December 31, 2007) will be&#13;
extended by two years. Should the ITF termination date not be extended, the Recipient would&#13;
seek additional sources of financing for the remaining activities.&#13;
&#13;
31.      This section describes in detail the implementation arrangement for the ESPP which will&#13;
provide urgent support in the areas described above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
32.     Coordination of the project will be the responsibility of the already established PMO&#13;
located within MOLSA in Baghdad, while implementation will be the responsibility of the&#13;
respective departments of MOLSA for the Safety Net component, and of the PRSC in MOF for&#13;
the Pensions component. The PMO will report directly to the Minister of Labor and Social&#13;
Affairs and will manage the core functions needed to administer the project, namely: (i)&#13;
Administration, (ii) Financial Management, (iii) Procurement, and (iv) Monitoring, Evaluation&#13;
and Reporting. It will also assume the function of donor coordination. PMO functions will be&#13;
carried out by assigned MOLSA staff or, as assessed and agreed during project implementation if&#13;
needed, by Iraqi consultants selected on a competitive basis. The PMO will serve as the main&#13;
point of communication with the World Bank on matters relating to implementation of the&#13;
project. Technical assistance and training will be provided to PMO staff in project management&#13;
and planning, procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation to ensure&#13;
proper functioning of the unit. Project implementation will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
Master Implementation Manual (MIM) that was prepared in early 2005 for all World Bank or&#13;
ITF-financed projects in Iraq. A Project Implementation Manual (PIM) specifically tailored to&#13;
this project will be prepared by the PMO by Project Launch, and will be used in conjunction with&#13;
the MIM.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Because this is an emergency project to be implemented in a period of about 3 years in an&#13;
unstable and unpredictable environment, monitoring and evaluation will focus on short term&#13;
outcomes rather than longer term outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation of Component 1: Safety Nets&#13;
&#13;
34.     The SSN program is already being implemented across Iraq. Applications for welfare&#13;
benefits are submitted to the Social Welfare Offices (SWO) within each Governorate, which will&#13;
enter the information into the database. This information will then be collected in one of the 5&#13;
hubs (Baghdad, Erbil, Najaf, Basra and Mosul), to be aggregated and sent to the Social Welfare&#13;
Directorate (SWD) in Baghdad. It is expected that in the near future, applications will be&#13;
approved at the local level. Benefits will be paid in cash through some 40 post offices and some&#13;
local MOLSA offices in some cases.&#13;
&#13;
35.     The project is taking an integrated approach to information and communication&#13;
technology (ICT) for MOLSA. ICT infrastructure will be established through the project, while in&#13;
parallel the key SSN information systems will be developed and deployed to all Social Welfare&#13;
Centers in Iraq. Infrastructure requirements have been detailed, both at the MOLSA offices in&#13;
Baghdad, as well as connectivity and equipment requirements at the SSN Centers in Baghdad and&#13;
the other 18 governorates. In addition, progress has been made by BearingPoint/USAID on&#13;
detailing the technical and functional requirements for a pilot SSN information system, and has&#13;
initiated the development of this system through an international firm (Jordan-based) for a pilot at&#13;
MOLSA and two Baghdad SSN Centers.&#13;
&#13;
36.     There are several core principles that will drive ICT investments under the project:&#13;
&#13;
     · All ICT investments need to be guided by business requirements and processes of&#13;
        MOLSA, and the need to have ICT Architectural and Strategic Plan to guide investments;&#13;
     · The strategic goal is to be able to conduct "horizontal" integration amongst the various&#13;
        functions that MOLSA would be engaged in (i.e., social safety net, pensions, labor&#13;
        markets information, training, etc.), leading to integrated social services;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · For infrastructure, investments should be conducted within a general framework that&#13;
         would allow the system to scale as needs are expanded, and as more functions are added;&#13;
    · The establishment of a framework and a platform in which building blocks can be added&#13;
         at the right time, with an expected measure of integration across functions and processes;&#13;
    · Capacity building is a key goal, and investments are to be made in professional&#13;
         development for MOLSA staff (professional, technical, operational);&#13;
    · Focus in applications will be on operational systems (the Social Safety Net application),&#13;
         as opposed to administrative/back-end systems (Human Resource, Finance, Asset&#13;
         Management).&#13;
&#13;
37.      Project Management Teams (PMTs) have been established in each Governorate within&#13;
the Social Welfare Offices (SWOs). The role of the PMTs is to monitor the social safety net&#13;
component on behalf of the PMO and provide input to be used in quarterly progress reports.&#13;
&#13;
38.      The grant will finance IT equipment for the SWOs, the 5 hubs and the SWD in Baghdad.&#13;
Computer training will be provided to master-trainers based in the SWD in Baghdad and the&#13;
hubs, who will provide intensive training to SWOs' data entry staff (train-the-trainers model).&#13;
&#13;
Implementation of Component 2: Pensions&#13;
&#13;
39.      This component will include four main activities: (i) a survey of beneficiaries of the state&#13;
pension system, (ii) a survey of contributors of state pension system; (iii) installation of IT&#13;
infrastructure for storing individual records of contributors and beneficiaries for the MOF, the&#13;
SPS and the SSS; (iv) training of technical staff from MOF, SPS and SSS on data entry, database&#13;
management (record-keeping) and data analysis for pension policy-making. The MOF will be in&#13;
charge of the implementation of the first two activities in close coordination with the SPS, and&#13;
will coordinate the implementation of the IT system that will be financed by ESPP. The PMO in&#13;
MOLSA will be responsible for all project management aspects related to the implementation of&#13;
this component.&#13;
&#13;
40.      A small Project Implementation Team (PIT) headed by the Manager of Budget&#13;
Operations from MOF (who is also a member of the PRSC) will be the focal point for all&#13;
activities implemented by MOF or SPS. The PIT will coordinate on a routine basis with the PMO&#13;
in MOLSA and will also provide input to progress reports. Specific terms of references for the&#13;
PIT are being developed by MOF and will be included in the PIM.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Inter-ministerial implementation arrangements. Several coordinated implementation&#13;
arrangements have been planned for the different activities included in this component: (i)&#13;
development of the questionnaires and the sample frames for both surveys, the database&#13;
application software design for the MOF, the SPS and SSS, printing of the questionnaires and&#13;
data entry for survey outputs will be done through one contract by the same company; (ii) training&#13;
of MOF, MOLSA, SPS and SSS staff in data entry and database management and data analysis&#13;
will be done at the same time for the technical staff from all institutions; (iii) the purchasing of IT&#13;
equipment will be packaged with the SSN component to gain efficiencies. The IT specifications&#13;
for the pension component equipment might be developed separately to meet MOF specification&#13;
requirements. These implementation arrangements will ensure consistency throughout&#13;
implementation of the pension component (the survey production, collection,&#13;
administration, and usage cycle).&#13;
&#13;
42.      Representative survey of pension beneficiaries and contributors of the SPS. The&#13;
objective of these surveys is to construct an accurate baseline of the current system and allow for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial projections of pension policies. The survey form will be designed such that it could be&#13;
used by the MOF and SPS as a data reporting form to continue the collection of information and&#13;
expand the digitized data-base of contributors and beneficiaries. It is expected that the training of&#13;
MOF and SPS staff financed through this project will built the necessary skills and knowledge&#13;
needed for the MOF and the SPS to take the process of up-dating contributors and beneficiaries&#13;
records forward. Both surveys will be sent to the field by the MOF, preceded by specific&#13;
instructions to public servants in state banks and public companies.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Digitization of records of Beneficiary's records in the SSS. The project will finance the&#13;
establishment of a data center in the SSS to capture beneficiary's data for the SSS. A team from&#13;
the SSS and MOLSA IT department will be designated to conduct the process of migrating data&#13;
from the current system (FoxPro database in the Employment Center in MOLSA) onto the new&#13;
system financed through the project. Upon conversion, all electronic records will be audited&#13;
against paper records to ensure accuracy. The application will be developed by the same&#13;
consultant providing similar services to the SPS. It is expected that the training of SSS and&#13;
MOLSA staff that will be financed from this project will allow the SSS to keep computerized&#13;
records of all new beneficiaries enrolled in the SSS.&#13;
&#13;
44.      Set-up of Core Information Technology System in MOF, SPS and SSS. Agreement was&#13;
reached to develop a core information technology system that would serve as support for the data&#13;
generated by the surveys of beneficiaries and contributors to the SPS, as well as for continued&#13;
digitization of beneficiaries' records and capturing of individual contributors' information. The&#13;
project will also finance appropriate training of staff needed for data entry and analysis. The&#13;
technical specifications for the IT hardware and database application as well as the connectivity&#13;
arrangements will be designed to support a future unified database of pension contributors and&#13;
beneficiaries consistent with MOF's and MOLSA's requirements for data integration and&#13;
information exchange.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
45.      Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May&#13;
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement. The general description&#13;
of various items under different expenditure categories is given below. For each contract to be&#13;
financed by the Grant, the procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs,&#13;
prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank project&#13;
team in the Procurement Plan (PP). The PP will be updated at least annually or as required to&#13;
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A&#13;
General Procurement Notice was published in Dg Market on May 11, 2006 and in UNDB on May&#13;
15, 2006 and will be revised at least annually. In addition procurement procedures and sample&#13;
bidding documents can be found in the MIM and the PIM.&#13;
&#13;
46.      To expedite the implementation of the project, the first bidding documents for the first&#13;
year of project implementation will be finalized by June 15, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Procurement of Goods: For International Competitive Bidding (ICB), the Bank standard&#13;
bidding documents (SBD) for the Procurement of Goods, and Procurement of IT (with&#13;
appropriate modifications) will be used. For procurement of Goods under National Competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bidding (NCB), the MIM standard bidding documents in Arabic or English will be used.&#13;
Shopping of Goods will be used as presented in the procurement plan using the MIM Request for&#13;
Quotations and Purchase Order Standard Forms.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Selection of Consultants: Consultants' services procured under this project will include:&#13;
(i) Beneficiary Assessments, (ii) Review of targeting and eligibility determination, (iii) Survey&#13;
design that includes review, update, and finalization of the survey design detailed forms including&#13;
printing, software, and data entry; and (iv) selection of individuals to assist the PMO in project&#13;
implementation in the areas of training and support of MOLSA staff in procurement, financial&#13;
management, project management and other contract administration as needed. Most of the&#13;
selection for consulting firms will be based on Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
49.     Operating Costs: The Grant will finance expenditures directly related to the management&#13;
of the project, such as: (i) maintenance of office and IT equipment; (ii) transportation and travel,&#13;
including per diem allowances for Project staff in travel status; (iii) office supplies, utilities and&#13;
office administration, including translation, printing and advertising; (iv) fuel costs; (v)&#13;
communication costs; (vi) costs for production of bidding documents; and (vii) commercial bank&#13;
charges. No salaries of the Recipient's civil servants will be financed under the project. The&#13;
operating costs that will be financed by the project will be procured using the MOLSA&#13;
administrative procedures for shopping satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
50.     In 2005, the World Bank conducted an Operational Procurement Review (OPR) of the&#13;
public procurement system in Iraq to help enhancing the Bank's knowledge of the overall&#13;
procurement system in Iraq. The OPR revealed that procurement environment which prevailed in&#13;
Iraq during the last two decades was different from the norms of acceptable international practice.&#13;
The major issue facing public procurement now in Iraq is the current uncertainty of public&#13;
procurement laws and regulations that causes high risk within weak control environment. The risk&#13;
essentially roots in the lack of good laws and regulations, modern standard documentation, lack&#13;
of trained concerned staff in procurement using Bank guidelines and international sound&#13;
procurement practice, and the lack of law enforcement which would increase the risk&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
51.     In addition an assessment of MOLSA's capacity to implement project procurement was&#13;
conducted in March 2006 by the Bank's local procurement consultant through discussion with&#13;
MOLSA staff in Baghdad before the pre-appraisal/appraisal mission and reviewed by the team's&#13;
Senior Procurement Specialist. Subsequently, the assessment included staffing, organization,&#13;
record keeping, and procurement management cycle and contract administration. Based on the&#13;
assessment related measurements would be taken to manage and mitigate the identified risks.&#13;
&#13;
52.     The assessment showed that MOLSA have no specialized or centralized department for&#13;
procurement and it implements procurement through it's different departments:&#13;
&#13;
        · The Commercial Department is responsible for importing goods from outside of Iraq&#13;
             and for international contracting. This department dealt with the UN oil for food&#13;
             program ­ the tenth stage in 2001 where the ministry procured goods for a value&#13;
             superior to US$17 million (16 contracts). No other contract was signed since the&#13;
             invasion in 2003;&#13;
        · The Information and Technology Department is responsible for local procurement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             IT equipment. During the year of 2005, the department procured for the value of&#13;
             US$1.5 million (one contract);&#13;
        · The Maintenance and Construction Department is responsible for civil works&#13;
             contracts for rehabilitation. During the year of 2005, the department implemented&#13;
             more than 18 contracts in the value of ID 1,500,000,000 (more than US$1 million&#13;
             equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
53.     Based on the existing information on the overall environment for procurement in Iraq and&#13;
in particular within MOLSA, the overall procurement risk assessment is judged to be high, which&#13;
therefore requires the assignment of a dedicated and qualified procurement officer to the project,&#13;
as well as the provision of intensive formal and on-the-job training to the PMO on procurement&#13;
and project management. In addition, the MIM and PIM are expected to provide significant&#13;
guidance to PMO procurement staff.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Basic procurement training was already provided to the PMO team and MOLSA Head of&#13;
Commercial Department by the Bank in Baghdad and Amman, to enhance the capacity of the&#13;
implementing entity. Further training will be provided throughout project implementation and&#13;
during the project launch workshop.&#13;
&#13;
55.     Annex 4 provides further detailed analysis of the Recipient's institutional capacity to&#13;
implement procurement, as well as the procurement plan and arrangements for the project.&#13;
&#13;
Iraq: High Risk ­ Weak Control Environment&#13;
&#13;
56.     Iraq's ability to manage public resources is undermined by poor security and outdated&#13;
practices. Moreover; Iraq is ranked poorly on Transparency International's Corruption Perception&#13;
Index, the lowest of all countries in the Region. There are reports from the auditors of the US&#13;
Government Accountability Office and the auditors of the Office of the Commission on Public&#13;
Integrity (published in the media) that significant amounts of funds cannot be accounted for, and&#13;
that other reported spending could not be backed up with sufficient documentation. The audit also&#13;
found that its efforts were hampered by rampant disorganization and poor bookkeeping and that&#13;
contract files were "unavailable, incomplete, inconsistent and unreliable." As part of risk&#13;
mitigation in the project, the following measurements were considered in the design of the&#13;
operation and for the implementation of the project:&#13;
&#13;
    · Design the operations and procurement packaging with increased attention to mitigate the&#13;
        risk of weak control environment;&#13;
    · Greater supervision attention would be devoted at the project level; e.g. lower the prior&#13;
        review threshold and conduct ex-post procurement reviews frequently;&#13;
    · A Fiduciary Monitoring Agent is hired by the Bank and will also be conducting fiduciary&#13;
        monitoring of this project including spot physical inspection;&#13;
    · Ensuring that the client from the start establish a good record keeping for all procurement&#13;
        and contract management and develop a good filing system;&#13;
    · Train PMO and the designated procurement officer in particular on sound procurement&#13;
        practices following the ethics and code of conduct required by the implementing agency;&#13;
    · Educate the PMT as well as private sector on the procedures the Bank takes in case of&#13;
        allegations of corruption;&#13;
    · A Bank local procurement consultant who is on the ground will closely supervise&#13;
        procurement activities;&#13;
    · Limit the use of non competitive procedures in procurement of goods and services as well&#13;
        as in consultants' selections;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · The Bank is now engaged with the government in supporting the government in the&#13;
         reform of the public procurement sector which will include as part of the reform drafting&#13;
         a unified public procurement law.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
57.      MOLSA, at pre-appraisal, prepared a PP (Annex 4) for project implementation which&#13;
provides the basis for procurement packages and methods to be used in this Project. This plan has&#13;
been agreed on between the MOLSA, MOF and the Bank at negotiations, and will be available in&#13;
the project's database and on the Bank's external website. The PP will be updated in agreement&#13;
with the Project Team as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
58.      In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, and based&#13;
on the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency, at least one supervision mission is&#13;
planned every three months to ensure the agency following the Procurement guidelines and&#13;
procedures during the implementation. Until security conditions make travel to Iraq possible for&#13;
international Bank staff, the Bank employed a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA), an&#13;
independent firm that operates within Iraq and supports the Bank in carrying out its supervision&#13;
function, including spot physical inspection. In addition, the Bank will rely on reports from the&#13;
local procurement consultant who is working for the Bank from within Iraq. During the interim&#13;
period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement staff will meet outside Iraq to carry out&#13;
off-site supervision as well as using audio conference to maintain effective communication on the&#13;
progress of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to Build the Agencies Capacity&#13;
&#13;
    · A procurement officer was assigned to the PMO with the support of the head of the&#13;
         Commercial Department at MOLSA to be responsible for all procurement aspects during&#13;
         implementation. Those two officers will receive both formal and ad-hoc procurement&#13;
         training on efficient handling of the procurement activities under the project;&#13;
    · A series of training sessions and workshops were carried out during pre-appraisal and&#13;
         will continue throughout project implementation. The target audience is PMO and PMT&#13;
         staff, and other employees of the MOLSA involved in procurement;&#13;
    · A PIM will be prepared on the basis of the MIM to provide standard procurement&#13;
         documents, evaluation reports, progress reports, filing requirements that will be followed&#13;
         throughout project implementation;&#13;
    · The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank staff to&#13;
         provide hands-on training to staff of the PMO;&#13;
    · A Project Launch Workshop, attended by all project stakeholders, will be held in Arabic&#13;
         (or with Arabic translation) soon after Grant signing.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
59.      The proposed Grant of US$8.0 million is expected to be disbursed by June 30, 2009.&#13;
Annex 5, Table C describes the allocation of the Grant proceeds according to each expenditure&#13;
category. A four-month grace period for payments of contracts completed by June 30, 2009 may&#13;
be granted by the Bank, if needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60.      The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient&#13;
entities. Trained Project Management Teams (PMTs) (or in the case of MOLSA, a PMO) are&#13;
established to facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other&#13;
safeguards. PMO staff are employed and paid by the implementing agency at regular salary&#13;
levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of stand-along Project Implementation Units, which&#13;
can erode civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term. The Project will&#13;
finance specialized technical support in procurement, financial management and other areas, as&#13;
needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds are used for the purposes intended and to help&#13;
carry out project supervision on the ground in Iraq, the Bank has hired an independent firm as a&#13;
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) (see Annex 5 for more details on the role of the FMA).&#13;
&#13;
61.      As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct&#13;
payment by the Bank to the consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the MOLSA, direct&#13;
payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the consultant, or vendor&#13;
in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred internationally. The Special&#13;
Commitment method will also be used for importing goods, whereby, the Bank will issue special&#13;
commitments to commercial banks to reimburse them for payments made to suppliers against&#13;
Letters of Credit issued at the request of MOLSA for eligible expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
62.      Disbursements for the project management component and payments below the threshold&#13;
of US$20,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources.&#13;
These payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic&#13;
basis, by the Bank to the MOLSA upon presentation of full supporting documents, proof of&#13;
payment and a signed withdrawal application. The Bank may later require the use of Statements&#13;
of Expenditure (SOE) for payments below US$20,000. The PMO and the main financial&#13;
counterparts from the MOLSA will be provided intensive training in Bank disbursement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
63.      The project financial resources are extended through the ITF and will be managed within&#13;
the framework of the MOLSA systems, regulations and controls. A financial management&#13;
assessment was undertaken, remotely, through meetings with MOLSA representatives to assess&#13;
the MOLSA financial management system and to determine the arrangements to be adopted in&#13;
order to enhance the existing controls and fulfill the reporting requirement of the project.&#13;
&#13;
64.      Iraq has been defined as one of the "high risk-weak control environment countries" that&#13;
require special attention at the Country, sector, and project level. Major reasons for this&#13;
categorization are the security conditions, the glaring weaknesses of the banking system, which&#13;
hamper the domestic payment system and the accuracy of the budget reporting, the many years of&#13;
isolation that Iraq endured, and the very low ranking in the Corruption Perception Index for 2005.&#13;
Based on the results of the assessment, the factors mentioned above and the outcome of the&#13;
various reports issued by independent auditors and other donors, the fiduciary risk of the Grant&#13;
not being used for the intended purposes, with due regard to economy, efficiency and the&#13;
sustainable achievement of the project's development, is considered as high. The financial&#13;
management risk as an element of the fiduciary risk is also high. The Bank will however benefit,&#13;
to a certain extent, from the limited knowledge acquired from the implementation of the ongoing&#13;
ITF-financed projects to help mitigate these risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65.     The financial management risk will be partly managed through: (i) reinforcing the present&#13;
controls as applied by the MOLSA; (ii) the engagement of a dedicated financial officer and an&#13;
accountant, if needed, to manage the project financial activities; (iii) payments to most&#13;
consultants and vendors will be made through direct payment method, while payments below the&#13;
threshold of US$20,000 will be reimbursed to the MOLSA upon presentation of supporting&#13;
documentation and proof of payment; (iv) maintaining a fixed assets register and spreadsheet for&#13;
purchased and delivered equipment; (v) setting clear roles and responsibilities of PMO, PTI,&#13;
PMTs and defining the input content and periodicity needed for the PMO to process the payment&#13;
request; (vi) using a spreadsheet application to keep track of the project accounts and to generate&#13;
the project reports; (vii) having a FMA inside Iraq to monitor the project activities and support&#13;
the PMO; (viii) the timely engagement of an independent auditor, with international experience&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, to perform the project audit and issue an independent auditor's opinion;&#13;
and (ix) documenting FM arrangements in a chapter of the PIM.&#13;
&#13;
66.     In addition, the residual risk, where possible, will be managed during project&#13;
implementation through close monitoring and supervision by the Bank FMS. A brief introduction&#13;
to project FM requirements was made to the PMO financial officer and further training will be&#13;
provided during the project launch workshop and throughout the project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
67.     The project financial management arrangements, the financial management risks and&#13;
related mitigating measures are disclosed in Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
&#13;
68.     Project activities will be completed by March 31, 2009. The Bank, as the ITF&#13;
Administrator, will supervise the project in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures. While staff travel to Iraq is restricted, supervision of recipient-executed operations&#13;
will be carried out through consultants and the FMA. It will include visits to the MOLSA, MOF,&#13;
MOPDC as well as the project sites for the purpose of reviewing implementation progress, impact&#13;
of project activities, and related documentation. This supervision will be backed by quarterly staff&#13;
supervisions to meet with MOLSA at a third country location. Each ITF-funded operation is&#13;
required to include a results-based supervision plan that reflects realities on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
69.     The PMO will prepare and send to the Bank a quarterly progress report. The first report&#13;
will be due starting at the end of the first quarter following the initial disbursement. The format&#13;
of the report will be agreed by Project Launch.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in&#13;
respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90) days&#13;
of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the Bank will&#13;
prepare, on a cash basis, an un-audited statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance&#13;
with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such statement will be expressed&#13;
in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds will b e maintained by the Bank. In&#13;
addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements&#13;
relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an un-audited&#13;
financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and&#13;
forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71.      The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the ITF&#13;
             (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress in the&#13;
             preceding six months; and&#13;
         (b) on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from the&#13;
             Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
             financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
72.      The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal&#13;
costs of the Bank with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank will provide&#13;
each donor with a copy of the auditor's report.&#13;
&#13;
73.      The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The Bank&#13;
will provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of&#13;
the activities undertaken by the FMA. Within six months of completion of the activities, or of full&#13;
disbursement of the contributions, whichever comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress&#13;
report to each donor, together with a copy of the independent review of the performance of the&#13;
FMA. Upon request by any donor, the Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports&#13;
received by the Bank from the FMA on the activities financed by the contributions.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
74.      No Environmental and Social Safeguards are triggered by this project.&#13;
&#13;
E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
75.      This project is a part of the interim strategy of the World Bank and addresses the&#13;
immediate needs of the social protection sector. The project's primary economic justification is&#13;
institutional capacity building and the enhancement of governance in the GOI's social safety net&#13;
and pensions programs, which are set to expand. If done well the public welfare gains to the&#13;
economy will be significant, and the cost effectiveness gains to GOI will be substantial as the&#13;
project should enable reduction over time in the PDS program. The project addresses the GOI's&#13;
need for better information and capacity to improve safety net and pension programs management&#13;
within an environment where assistance and services to the vulnerable are lacking and resources&#13;
are constrained. The quick and accurate implementation of social protection programs,&#13;
particularly the safety net, will foster a degree of social stabilization, improve the targeting of&#13;
resources to the poor and assist with the realization of broader economic reforms designed to&#13;
stimulate long term growth. The reform of expensive and regressive energy subsidies are tied to&#13;
the success of the safety net. Providing adequate income for the old-age population while&#13;
maintaining fiscal discipline requires reforms of the current retirement income provision&#13;
framework. Adequate information, management, and technology are keys to improving policy&#13;
making, strategy development and program management.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The size of the project grant is small at US$8 million. Yet the potential financial returns&#13;
on the investment are substantial. The cash transfer social safety net program is estimated to cost&#13;
US$330 million annually in benefits to 1 million families across Iraq. Putting in place the&#13;
technology and mechanisms to accurately assess eligibility and determine benefits can mean&#13;
millions of dollars in improved efficiency. Errors of inclusion are common in cash-based&#13;
assistance programs for the poor and up to 80% of benefits go to the non-poor in some areas of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Middle East. With even moderate improvements in targeting and supporting technology and&#13;
management mechanisms, these leakages can be brought down by 20 percentage points. If such a&#13;
situation were to prevail with the Iraq safety net program, the project would contribute to a&#13;
doubling of the benefits that go the very poor, or up to US$66 million. While not based on hard&#13;
data or employing formal rate of return calculations, the discussion suggests a significant&#13;
efficiency return just from the safety net component. This does not include the benefits from&#13;
better pension data, improved monitoring and evaluation capability, or technical assistance to&#13;
improve program design. The activities funded though this grant to support pensions will&#13;
contribute to increased policy making capacity and governance of the current pension schemes.&#13;
This could enable the Government to make informed policy decisions to reform pensions that&#13;
would improve their cost-effectiveness, equity and financial sustainability over the longer term.&#13;
&#13;
F. RISKS&#13;
&#13;
77.     The project will be implemented in a high-risk environment. Iraq's security environment&#13;
is unstable in some regions, and the country is undergoing a major political transition. The table&#13;
below provides a summary of the key project risks that have been identified, and the measures to&#13;
be taken to mitigate those risks.&#13;

               contract documents. A contractor's or a supplier's performance security shall apply&#13;

          ANNEX 5: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
&#13;
Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       The project is implemented by both the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA)&#13;
and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Each ministry is responsible for a separate project&#13;
component that would be executed by relative ministry's directorates and committees. The&#13;
overall coordination of the project will be undertaken by the Project Management Office (PMO)&#13;
in MOLSA, who will be responsible for facilitating and managing the project implementation,&#13;
including the financial management activities. The Project Implementation Team (PIT) in MOF&#13;
will serve as a focal point and coordinate with the PMO.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Assessment of the financial management arrangements for MOLSA was undertaken&#13;
through meetings with their representatives in Jordan. Results of the assessments are available in&#13;
Project files. The purpose of the assessment is to determine whether the financial management&#13;
arrangements available are acceptable to the Bank, and to help identify areas that need additional&#13;
arrangements or controls. Based on the information provided, the existing financial management&#13;
systems are based on principles and procedures defined by the public legal framework. The&#13;
financial resources extended through the ITF will be managed within the framework of the&#13;
MOLSA's financial management system and additional World Bank procurement and financial&#13;
management procedures.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The financial management risk of the project was assessed as high at both the country&#13;
level and the project level. In order to mitigate a number of weaknesses identified in the financial&#13;
management system, the Bank, MOLSA and MOF have introduced additional arrangements for&#13;
the project, including: the establishment of a centralized FM function at the PMO represented by&#13;
a financial officer; the use of direct payments; use of parallel accounting records to reflect project&#13;
activities, submission of quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs), the engagement of the&#13;
fiduciary monitoring agent responsible for monitoring the ITF-financed projects, and appointment&#13;
of an external auditor with international experience to review the FMRs and undertake the project&#13;
audit. Despite of the introduced mitigating measures, there will still be risks that might hamper&#13;
the execution of the project.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Details of the ratings and the agreed mitigating measures are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Country Financial Management Risk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.       A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) has not been undertaken for&#13;
Iraq. However; numerous reports, including the International Monetary Fund-World Bank April&#13;
2005 report on Iraq Public Financial Management show a high inherent risk in almost all the&#13;
main functions of a financial management system (budgeting, internal controls, accounting,&#13;
reporting). The security situation, the glaring weaknesses of the banking system, which hamper&#13;
the domestic payment system and the accuracy of the budget reporting, the many years of&#13;
isolation that Iraq endured, and the very low ranking of Iraq in the Corruption Perception Index&#13;
for 2005 have all contributed to this risk. For all those factors and more, Iraq has been defined by&#13;
the Bank as one of the "high risk ­ weak control environment countries" that require special&#13;
attention at the Country, sector and project level. Nevertheless, the Bank would benefit from the&#13;
limited knowledge acquired from the implementation of the ongoing ITF-financed projects.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Financial Management Risk&#13;
&#13;
6.       Critical risk factors at the project level that need attention of all stakeholders and very&#13;
close monitoring are: (i) lack of a fixed assets management system to maintain purchased and&#13;
delivered goods (equipment and furniture) financed by the project; (ii) MOLSA not being able to&#13;
maintain project account for payment of small amounts (less than US$20,000) throughout the life&#13;
of the project leading to interruption of the project execution; (iii) possible low level of&#13;
coordination and reporting arrangements between MOLSA, MOF and the governorates through&#13;
the PMO, PIT, and other ministries' directorates, leading to incomplete information to support&#13;
payment requests; (iv) delays of receipt of Bank disbursement experienced in Iraq due to the&#13;
inefficiencies of the banking payment system; (v) delays in issuing authorizations for payments&#13;
leading to overdue payments; and (vi) limited capacity to meet the project's financial&#13;
management requirements.&#13;

7.       MOLSA is comprised of four directorates: Social Welfare, Labor and Social Security,&#13;
Employment and Vocational Training, Youth Rehabilitation, in addition to the Secretary General&#13;
Office (Diwan) and the Inspector General Directorate. Each governorate of the 18 existing&#13;
governorates has both a Social Welfare and Labor and Social Security directorates. All MOLSA&#13;
directorates follow the central accounting system that is financed through budget allocations from&#13;
MOF, except the Labor and Social Security directorate that is a revenue-generating entity&#13;
following the unified accounting system. The financial Affairs Department at the Diwan, having&#13;
12 employees, has four sections: Accounting, Payments, Payroll, and Fixed Assets. Its main&#13;
responsibilities are preparing the annual budget for the Diwan and consolidating all other&#13;
directorates' budgets, accounting records maintenance, payroll processing, and inventory control.&#13;
The Internal Control Department at the Diwan, having nine employees, is responsible for ex ante&#13;
and post audit of expenditures, performance of periodical banking and advances reconciliations,&#13;
periodical stock-take, and review of reports before submission to MOF. Each directorate in&#13;
MOLSA has an IQD current account in Rafidain Bank. A combination of the Financial and&#13;
Internal Control verification ensures the regularity of the payment in all aspects of compliance&#13;
with the enforced rules, allocation with the budget, and existence of proper signature before&#13;
disbursement or replenishment of advances.&#13;
&#13;
Project FM Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
8.       MOLSA has designated the Head of the Financial Department as the Financial Officer&#13;
(FO) of the PMO. The FO undertakes the responsibilities of maintaining contracts, acquiring&#13;
complete and accurate data from the PIT and governorates, ensuring timely payments&#13;
authorization, submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank, and keeping financial records of&#13;
the project. The PMO would be supplemented with an accountant if the FO is not able to provide&#13;
sufficient time to the project.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Payment Authorization and Flow of Information. Financial activities are subject to&#13;
MOLSA controls and procedures, as well as the PMO verification and approval processes.&#13;
Agreed upon documents supporting the execution of the activity or receipt of the service, need to&#13;
be periodically submitted by the PIT for the component implemented by the MOF to the PMO,&#13;
which will send the payment requests to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Accounting System. Based on the relatively small number of payments transactions&#13;
(about 200 over the project life), spreadsheet applications will be used to record the project's&#13;
financial transactions and generate reports. Backup procedures for protecting the data and&#13;
preventing losses will be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Budgeting and Disbursement Forecasts. The PMO FO will maintain a project budget and&#13;
detailed disbursement plan per quarter.      This plan will be developed based on the initial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement plan and estimated payments cycles, and revised upon need. It will be used as a&#13;
monitoring tool to analyze budget variances and manage cash.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Project Records Reconciliation. The PMO FO will monthly reconcile accounts of funds&#13;
disbursed by the Bank to accounting records. In addition, the FO will also reconcile the project&#13;
account balance granted by MOLSA with reimbursements made by the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
Reporting&#13;
&#13;
14.     Quarterly: The PMO will be responsible for generating the interim quarterly financial&#13;
reports/Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), and submitting to the Bank within 45 days from&#13;
quarter then ended. They will be integrated within the project quarterly progress reports. The&#13;
proposed format of the reports is in the Project files. These reports consist of:&#13;
&#13;
   · Financial Reports: will include a statement of sources and uses of funds by component,&#13;
        use of funds/expenditure report by category and governorate comparing actual and&#13;
        planned expenditures. In addition, a narrative report explaining all variances that exceed&#13;
        15 percent when compared to planned and proposed corrective actions should be included&#13;
        as an annex to the financial reports.&#13;
   · Contracts Reports: will provide information on contracts, including information on all&#13;
        authorized contract variations, and showing financial status of contracts against plans.&#13;
&#13;
   · Goods (Equipment and Furniture) Reports: will provide information on goods purchased&#13;
        and delivered under the project.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed format of the reports will be agreed upon by the project negotiation.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Annually: The PMO will be responsible for preparing the Project Financial Statements&#13;
(PFS), and have them audited by the external auditor, and submitted to the Bank not later than six&#13;
months after the end each fiscal year. The PFS include:&#13;
   · Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds by component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures by category and governorate&#13;
         showing cumulative balances.&#13;
    · List of commitments or signed contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Audit&#13;
&#13;
16.      An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to perform&#13;
the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements (PFS) and&#13;
compliance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines and terms of the grant agreement. The&#13;
external audit report will encompass all of the Project's activities and will be in accordance with&#13;
internationally accepted auditing standards. MOLSA will remit a project audit report to the Bank&#13;
not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor selection process will be&#13;
launched directly after the grant agreement is signed, as experience of other projects has shown&#13;
that this process tends to take much more time than expected due to limited PMO procurement&#13;
capacity, the lack of local audit capacity, security conditions that hamper the willingness of&#13;
regional and international audit firms to work in Iraq, and exaggerated the audit fees. An Escrow&#13;
account will be used to pay the auditor after the project closing date. In addition to the audit&#13;
reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying any observations, comments,&#13;
and deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers pertinent, and will provide&#13;
recommendations for their improvements.&#13;
&#13;
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA)&#13;
&#13;
17.      The Bank has engaged an independent firm that will operate in Iraq as FMA for ITF-&#13;
financed projects. This FMA has dual roles:&#13;
&#13;
    · Verifying and validating to the Bank the projects' financial management and procurement&#13;
        arrangements and internal controls agreed upon with the implementing agencies.&#13;
    · Providing advisory services and technical support to the Iraqi government and the ITF-&#13;
        financed projects relating to the projects' financial management and procurement&#13;
        arrangements and the generation of periodical and reliable financial reports.&#13;
&#13;
18.      To perform his responsibilities, the FMA will be granted regular access to the project&#13;
documents at MOLSA, MOF and the other governorates.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation Manual&#13;
&#13;
19.      The PMO will draft and use a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) based on the Master&#13;
Implementation Manual (MIM) prepared for all Bank projects implemented in Iraq. Needed&#13;
training would be provided to the PMO FO in order to complete this task.&#13;
&#13;
Bank Financial Management Supervision&#13;
&#13;
20.      Where security conditions make travel to Iraq impossible for Bank staff, supervision&#13;
missions (not less than three a year) will be undertaken from Amman, Jordan. Close monitoring&#13;
of financial management arrangements will be conducted the through out the project life.&#13;
&#13;

Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
21.      The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to implement projects through the Iraqi Ministries (rather&#13;
than through project implementation units outside Government structures), ensuring that&#13;
appropriate and effective financial controls are in place over the use of funds provided by the&#13;
Bank, while at the same time working together to strengthen the Ministries' own financial control&#13;
processes and procedures. Taking into consideration the high risk environment assessed for the&#13;
project, including the assessed high financial management risk, the disbursement arrangements&#13;
will compensate by continuing to use conservative disbursement methods, namely:&#13;
&#13;
(i)      Direct Payments to suppliers and consultants for eligible expenditures for disbursements&#13;
over US$20,000.&#13;
(ii)     Reimbursement to the MOLSA for eligible expenditures under US$20,000 paid from&#13;
the MOLSA resources.&#13;
(iii)    Special Commitments to a commercial bank to reimburse the commercial bank for&#13;
payments made to a supplier against Letters of Credit issued at the request of the MOLSA for&#13;
eligible expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
22.      These are the disbursement methods that have been used for the existing World Bank ITF&#13;
projects currently under implementation and which have proven to be effective. Extensive&#13;
training will be provided to the PMO on the Bank's disbursement procedures. Supporting&#13;
documentation, e.g., copies of invoices and receipts, is required to be provided with all requests to&#13;
disburse funds. The original copies of the supporting documentation will be maintained by the&#13;
MOLSA and made available for review by Bank representatives upon request.&#13;
&#13;
23.      The agreements with the Donors to the World Bank ITF allow for the financing of 100&#13;
percent of project expenditures. The MOLSA would contribute implementation support,&#13;
including the assignment of MOLSA staff to the PMO and some related operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
24.      The allocation of the proceeds of the Grant by expenditure category is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
