&#13;
To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
 of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of changes in fund balance and the related statement&#13;
of composition of fund balance present fairly, in all material respects, the changes in fund balance&#13;
of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for the years ended June 30, 1992&#13;
and June 30, 1991, and the composition of fund balance at June 30, 1992 and 1991, in conformity&#13;
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with International Account-&#13;
ing Standards, and in accordance with the Administrative Arrangements between the International&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Centre for Settlement of Invest-&#13;
ment Disputes. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank and the Centre's&#13;
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on&#13;
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards, including International Auditing Guidelines, which require that we plan and&#13;
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free&#13;
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the&#13;
amounts and disclosures in the fmancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presen-&#13;
tation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;

            This is the annual report on the
            operation of the International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) required by Article 6(1) (g) of
            the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
            between States and Nationals of Other States. This annual
            report covers the fiscal year July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992.
            The report includes the audited financial statements of the
            centre, presented pursuant to administrative and financial
            regulation 19. During fiscal year 1992, membership in ICSID
            continued to grow with the ratification of the convention by
            five more countries. A further three countries signed the
            convention during the year, bringing the total number of
            signatories to 113. The new signatories include the Russian
            Federation, which signed the convention on June 16, 1992.
            The year also saw continued expressions of interest in
            membership by Latin American countries with two new
            signatories from that region. A major activity of the centre
            in the year was its preparation of background studies for
            and collaboration in other work on a World Bank Group report
            on the legal framework for the treatment of foreign
            investment. This report was requested by the Development
            Committee of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and
            International Monetary Fund. It may result in the issuance
            of guidelines that could contribute to the progressive
            development of the law relating to foreign investments.
