1. ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME&#13;
COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    With nominal per capita income of US$140 (1994), Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the&#13;
world. According to the recent Poverty Profile (1995), thirty percent of the population have incomes&#13;
which do not assure basic caloric needs. Malawi's population of about 11 million is growing at about 3.0&#13;
percent, and population density, at 170 inhabitants per km2, is among the highest in the region. The&#13;
population is predominantly rural (85%), dependent largely on subsistence agriculture, with over 55&#13;
percent having less than I hectare of arable land. Agriculture is mostly rainfed, and is highly susceptible&#13;
to climatic variability. Drought has occurred during three of the last four years. Malawi's social&#13;
indicators also reflect the level of poverty. Life expectancy is only 45 years, 7 years less than in&#13;
countries with similar income levels, and appears to be declining due to the impact of HIV/AIDS&#13;
prevalence which is one of the highest in the world. As much as 59 percent of the population is illiterate.&#13;
Water and sanitation and rural infrastructure are also inadequate with only half of the population having&#13;
access to safe water.&#13;
1.2    Malawi enjoyed healthy growth during the first years of independence, with per capita incomes&#13;
increasing between 1966 and 1980 at an annual average rate of 3 percent. However, during the last 15&#13;
years, Malawi has suffered from a series of shocks in the form of droughts, increases in oil prices and&#13;
interest rates, decreases in tobacco prices (Malawi's major export), and civil war in Mozambique which&#13;
significantly increased transport costs and brought more than I million refugees. Recent years have seen&#13;
a series of structural adjustment programs aimed at stabilizing the economy and removing impediments&#13;
to growth, including measures to enhance trade, improve agricultural pricing and marketing to increase&#13;
returns to smallholders, and most recently to tackle the pressing demand for land reform.&#13;
IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.3    Malawi is endowed with a diversified natural resources base which includes some of the most&#13;
fertile soils for agriculture in Southern Africa. The country has substantial forest and water resources,&#13;
and a remarkably rich flora and fauna. If properly utilized, these resources can provide the basis for&#13;
sustainable development of the country. The total land area of Malawi is 9.4 million hectares. Of this,&#13;
about 3 million hectares is suitable for rainfed agriculture using traditional methods of management. At&#13;
present about 50 percent of the total land area is under cultivation, indicating that a significant proportion&#13;
of marginal land is being exploited. Malawi's forests and woodlands occupy about 35 percent of the&#13;
country's land area. Forest resources are vital in the Malawi economy, providing over 90 percent of the&#13;
country's energy needs in addition to timber and many other non-wood forest products.&#13;
1.4    The surface water resources of Malawi comprise a network of river systems and lakes covering&#13;
20 percent of the country's territorial area. Surface water is totally dependent on rainfall, with the river&#13;
systems drying up to a large extent in the dry season. Malawi contains some of the world's most&#13;
important wetland ecosystems, including the shoreline plains of Lakes Malawi, Chiuta and Chiulwa, a&#13;
diversity of dambo ecosystems, and the marshes of the Lower Shire River. The country's electricity is&#13;
derived almost exclusively from a series of hydroelectric schemes on the Shire River, and is vulnerable&#13;
to prolonged drought which can cause the level of Lake Malawi to fall with lower flows into the Shire&#13;
River. Lake Malawi has a rich biodiversity with 500-1000 endemic species of fish, and its fish catches&#13;
provide 70 percent of the animal protein consumed in the country. Endowed with a rich flora and fauna&#13;
-I-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Malawi has five National Parks and four wildlife reserves accounting for 11 percent of the country's&#13;
area, and in 1980 established the world's first fresh water national park at Lake Malawi.&#13;
1.5    The Government of Malawi has become increasingly concerned about the deterioration of the&#13;
country's environment, and the associated loss of natural resources. A participant in the Earth Summit in&#13;
1992, Malawi subsequently launched the preparation of a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)&#13;
which was adopted in late 1994. Malawi's new Constitution, adopted in May 1994, reflects the&#13;
commitment of the country to address its environmental problems. Chapter III, section 13 (d) calls upon&#13;
the State:&#13;
"To manage the environment responsibly in order to:&#13;
(a)    prevent the degradation of the environment;&#13;
(b)    provide a healthy living and working environment for the people of Malawi;&#13;
(c)    accord full recognition to the rights of future generations by means of environmental&#13;
protection."&#13;
ISSUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.6    The National Environmental Action Plan identified nine key environmental issues: soil erosion,&#13;
deforestation, water resources degradation, high population growth, depletion of fish stocks, threats to&#13;
biodiversity, human habitat degradation, climatic change and air pollution. The underlying causes of&#13;
environmental degradation in Malawi are poverty and the growing imbalance of population to land&#13;
resources. Traditional land use practices that once helped preserve the integrity of natural resources are&#13;
no longer able to cope with the additional stresses placed upon them. With very limited access to land,&#13;
the poor place heavy demands on the natural resources base for subsistence and survival, and generally&#13;
lack the resources to intensify agricultural production. Forest products of all types (including charcoal,&#13;
fuelwood, bushmeat) are one of very few sources of cash income for the rural poor. The poor and&#13;
especially poor women are particularly vulnerable to the degradation of natural resources which provide&#13;
supplementary foods, medicines, water, and fuel. Women play a critical role as custodians of the&#13;
resources and educators of children. One quarter of the households in Malawi are headed by women.&#13;
About 42% of these female headed households cultivate under 0.5 hectares of land, and endure the&#13;
problems of the smallholder sector, such as limited land holdings, declining agricultural productivity and&#13;
low earnings and difficulties unique to women farmers. These include limited access to agricultural&#13;
extension services, differentials in wage rates for agricultural labor and more household tasks such as&#13;
gathering wood and water.&#13;
Land&#13;
1.7   Soil erosion is one of the principal types of land degradation, posing a threat to soil fertility, crop&#13;
production, food security and sustainable agricultural production. In Malawi, soil erosion is a major&#13;
cause of siltation with potentially disastrous consequences for hydro-electricity production. A lack of&#13;
reliable data and monitoring systems make it difficult to do a thorough quantitative analysis of the&#13;
impacts of land degradation and estimates vary considerably. The NEAP does single out soil erosion as&#13;
the first among nine important environmental issues.&#13;
Forest Resources&#13;
1.8    The rapid expansion of agriculture from the mid 1970s has led to extensive deforestation,&#13;
estimated at an annual rate of about 3.5 percent. Total forest cover is estimated to have declined by&#13;
- 2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about 40 percent during the period 1970-90. Although clearing for agriculture has been the main source&#13;
of deforestation, this has been exacerbated by the increasing demand for woodfuels and timber products.&#13;
The legal and policy framework in the forestry sector has also contributed to uncontrolled exploitation of&#13;
woodland and forest resources. With all rights to these resources vested in the State, local communities&#13;
have lacked the appropriate incentives to manage and protect them. Weak public sector institutions such&#13;
as the Forestry Department, reinforced by often antagonistic, "command and control" policies, have led&#13;
to high levels of distrust between communities and public authorities.&#13;
Water&#13;
1.9    Although total water resources in Malawi are considered adequate to meet the needs of the&#13;
growing population, these resources are becoming increasingly degraded through sedimentation,&#13;
biological contamination and effluents. Silt loads in surface water runoff leads to significant problems in&#13;
water quality, including turbidity, increased suspended solids, water flow problems and water treatment&#13;
costs. As indicated above, high sediment loads have caused siltation of rivers and reservoirs, requiring&#13;
costly dredging to maintain water and electricity production.&#13;
1.10   Almost 50 percent of all illness in Malawi is attributed to water borne diseases. As a result of&#13;
inadequate sanitation facilities and other sources of organic pollution, the bacteriological condition of the&#13;
rivers is poor throughout the year. Three quarters of the rivers show fecal coliform counts in excess of&#13;
500 per 100 ml. in the dry season which is dangerously above WHO standards. In urban areas,&#13;
groundwater resources are becoming increasingly contaminated through poor sanitation facilities. The&#13;
chemical contamination of stream water in urban and peri-urban areas is becoming a common problem&#13;
due to the improper disposal of industrial waste. Eutrophication of water bodies and the growth of water&#13;
weeds including water hyacinth threaten fish resources and other economic uses. Bilharzia, long&#13;
endemic in parts of Malawi, has recently appeared in some locations along Lake Malawi, which could&#13;
threaten tourism in the country.&#13;
Fisheries&#13;
1.11   Although reliable data are not available, evidence suggests that Malawi's fish resources are&#13;
under threat from overfishing and declining water resource quality. Increased fishing efforts and&#13;
deteriorating water resources quality are associated with declining catch rates. In Lake Malombe fish&#13;
production dropped from 10,000 tons per year in 1986 to 200-300 today. Localized declines are being&#13;
observed in Lake Malawi, although it is difficult to assess the overall production potential of the entire&#13;
lake. The degradation of breeding areas and overfishing has also threatened entire species, such as the&#13;
Ntchila spp., which, abundant in the 1950s, is now almost extinct.&#13;
Biodiversity&#13;
1.12   Malawi's rich biodiversity, which includes more that 6000 species of flora of which many are&#13;
endemic or near-endemic, is under threat from forest and land degradation. The scientific, agricultural&#13;
and medicinal values of this biodiversity is only beginning to be appreciated. Many species are now only&#13;
found in forest reserves and conservation areas, although these too suffer from encroachment and&#13;
degradation. Wild fauna are also threatened by loss of habitat and poaching and this degradation of the&#13;
wildlife estate undermines efforts to develop and expand the tourism industry. In this sector, similar to&#13;
that of forestry, local communities have borne most of the cost of wildlife and conservation activities,&#13;
and yet legally have received only very limited benefits. Only recently has this begun to change with&#13;
much greater emphasis being placed on the role and rights of communities living in or near protected&#13;
areas.&#13;
-3 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Human Settlement&#13;
1.13  In the rural areas, about 40 percent of the population do not use pit latrines, which has an impact&#13;
on surface and other water resources. Although predominantly rural, Malawi has annual urban growth of&#13;
about 7-10 percent in the four main urban areas - Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Zomba. These cities&#13;
are facing enormous problems in the face of this very rapid growth. Typical problems include:&#13;
inadequate waste disposal and water systems (with severe endemic and epidemic disease hazards) - only&#13;
30 percent of the urban population is connected to waterborne sewerage or septic tanks; few established&#13;
solid waste landfill sites; high degrees of informal settlement or "squatting"; rapid degradation of forest&#13;
resources in urban and peri-urban areas due to energy demand; a lack of recreational facilities; degraded&#13;
and polluted water courses, and above all, virtually no resources to tackle these urgent problems.&#13;
Institutional (community-based) structures to help address these problems are virtually non-existent. The&#13;
solutions currently being financed by the donors are often high cost - e.g., water borne sewerage systems&#13;
for Lilongwe when water availability is a major problem for many parts of the city. Also the general&#13;
ability to pay for operation and maintenance is very limited, particularly in the poorer areas. The&#13;
problems are serious and the situation is expected to deteriorate even further over the next several years&#13;
due to even more rapid population growth. Tackling these issues and planning for the future will require&#13;
a significant investment in capacity development at the local level, and a highly paLrticipatory process of&#13;
urban environmental planning.&#13;
Climate Change&#13;
1.14   As an agricultural economy, principally dependent on rainfed subsistence farming, Malawi is&#13;
highly vulnerable to drought and other extreme climatic events. If, as suggested by the&#13;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climatic variability increases over the coming&#13;
decades, Malawi will suffer from an increased incidence of drought and changing weather patterns.&#13;
Meteorological monitoring and drought proofing will become essential tools in helping Malawi to adapt&#13;
to longer term trends, and will also have short term benefits in helping to smooth out fluctuations in&#13;
agricultural output and GDP.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK&#13;
Background&#13;
1.15   The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), adopted in December, 1994, was prepared&#13;
using a highly participatory approach involving government, the private sector, non-government&#13;
organizations (NGOs) and traditional leaders. The NEAP identified the critical environmental issues&#13;
facing Malawi, and outlined a series of actions that should be taken in order to redress the problems of&#13;
resource degradation. The NEAP represented a crucial step towards establishing a policy and&#13;
institutional framework for environmental management, and identified the following elements necessary&#13;
to facilitate its implementation:&#13;
(a)    clearly defining institutional responsibilities and strengthening capacity;&#13;
(b)   formulating guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and instituting a&#13;
mechanism for their implementation; and&#13;
(c)    developing an Environmental Policy and Framework Law.&#13;
1.16   The NEAP, while identifying a list of priorities for investment and capacity building, did not go&#13;
into great detail or adequately address the tradeoffs between different interventions. The Government of&#13;
-4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Malawi therefore decided to develop the Environmental Support Programme (ESP) which would have as&#13;
its overall objective to "integrate environmental concerns into the socioeconomic development of the&#13;
country". The ESP is intended to support the umbrella framework incorporating strategies, policies and&#13;
priority programs to address environmental problems. The ESP covers the actions of many different&#13;
actors (government, non-government, community level) all of which play a crucial role in environmental&#13;
management in Malawi. The ESP is also designed to solicit resources to tackle Malawi's key&#13;
environmental issues, while providing a framework to help reduce duplication of effort.&#13;
1.17   The design of the ESP has taken place in a highly participatory fashion, involving a number of&#13;
Task Forces, a series of consultative exercises for community-based pilot activities, technical inputs from&#13;
a broad array of local and foreign sources including expertise from other African countries. Successive&#13;
drafts of a synthesis report for the ESP have been prepared and used to define more precisely the policy,&#13;
institutional and investment priorities which can be supported by the Government and by the&#13;
international community. Although not covering every activity falling under the broad category of&#13;
environment and natural resources management, the ESP document (copy on file) includes the main&#13;
elements of policy reform and institutional development, and itemizes an investment program valued at&#13;
over US$120 million (over 5 years). In May 1996, an ESP Roundtable held in Lilongwe, brought&#13;
together a broad range of Government departments and agencies, including members of municipalities&#13;
and local government, NGOs and donors, to discuss the strategy contained in the draft report on the ESP&#13;
and provide feedback on program priorities and focus.&#13;
1.18   The brainstorming and priority setting exercises undertaken during the Roundtable underscored&#13;
the following three themes: (i) the need for community participation and involvement in any effort to&#13;
improve environmental management and encourage the sustainable development of natural resources;&#13;
(ii) the need for capacity building, at the community level, and in the agencies and NGOs charged with&#13;
improving environmental management; (iii) the need to improve coordination amongst the different&#13;
actors involved in improving environmental management. In addition, participants ranked the following&#13;
topics very high in designing interventions: (iv) environmental education, (v) land degradation; (vi)&#13;
water resources management; and (vi) pollution in urban settlements. Annex 2 contains a summary of&#13;
the workshop. Subsequent workshops have been held on watershed degradation in the Shire River&#13;
catchments, on environmental education for which a national strategy has been prepared, and on&#13;
community-based natural resource management.&#13;
Policy Framework and Legislation&#13;
1.19   The National Environment Policy (NIEP) (copy on file) was adopted by the Cabinet in February&#13;
1996. The NEP seeks to:&#13;
(a)    promote the efficient utilization and management of natural resources;&#13;
(b)   facilitate the restoration and maintenance of essential ecosystems and ecological&#13;
processes;&#13;
(c)   enhance public awareness of the importance of sound environmental management; and&#13;
(d)    promote cooperation between government, local communities, women's groups, NGOs,&#13;
and the private sector in the management of the environment.&#13;
1.20   To provide a sound basis for environmentally sustainable development, the NEP specifies&#13;
guiding principles and strategies for both national and sectoral policies. At the national level, the NEP&#13;
recognizes that poverty is one of the root causes of environmental degradation. Poverty alleviation is&#13;
therefore critical for natural resource conservation and sustainable utilization. Proper economic&#13;
incentives are more effective than enforcement to induce people to undertake sustainable resource use&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and improved environmental management requires an enabling economic framework in which the&#13;
opportunity cost of using natural resources is reflected in their market prices. A key element in the NEP&#13;
is the recognition that communities have a right to benefits from sustainable utilization of natural&#13;
resources on all public and customary land.&#13;
1.21   The NEP sets out the principles for institutional coordination, focusing on advocacy, policy&#13;
formulation, authority to oversee compliance, and legal status derived from appropriate legislation. The&#13;
NEP outlines the generic requirements for improved environmental management, including framework&#13;
legislation, environmental planning, impact assessment, environmental education and public awareness,&#13;
private sector and community participation, demographic planning, and land tenure focusing on&#13;
empowering local communities to manage common property resources while protecting their rights. The&#13;
Policy also provides overall guidance on policies for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, parks and wildlife,&#13;
water resources, energy, industry, mining, and tourism.&#13;
1.22   The Environmental Management Act (EA-) (copy on file) was approved in June 1996. This&#13;
environmental framework law establishes the institutional and legal framework for environmental&#13;
management in Malawi. The Act sets out the duties and responsibilities of the Minister, the Director of&#13;
Environmental Affairs, the National Environmental Council, the Technical Committee and District&#13;
Environmental Officers. The EMA provides for the introduction of Environment Impact Assessment&#13;
(EIA) together with appropriate powers for the Minister and the Director of Environmental Affairs.&#13;
Other key elements of the legislation include: a series of provisions on environmental management,&#13;
pollution control, and legal sanctions, and; provision for the establishment of the Environmental Fund for&#13;
the "protection and management of the environment and the conservation and sustainable utilization of&#13;
natural resources".&#13;
1.23   Under the NEP and embodied in the EMA, provision is made for a review cf all sectoral policies&#13;
and legislation. To the extent that there are inconsistencies between sectoral legislation and the EMA,&#13;
the provisions of the EMA will prevail. This work has already started, commencing with a full review of&#13;
sectoral legislation to be followed by modifications where necessary to legislation and policies.&#13;
Present Institutional Arrangements&#13;
1.24   The NEP and the EMA establish the institutional structures for environmental management in&#13;
Malawi. The National Councilfor the Environment (NCE) is a high-level body whose Chairman is&#13;
appointed by the President. Membership includes the Principal Secretaries of Ministries, the General&#13;
Managers of the Bureau of Standards and the National Herbarium, and nominees from the private sector,&#13;
NGOs, the National Commission for Women in Development, and the University of Malawi. Meeting at&#13;
least four times per year, the NCE will have an advisory and watchdog role on environmental&#13;
management, on integrating environmental considerations in all aspects of economic planning and&#13;
development, and ensuring inter-agency coordination. The EMA also makes provision for a Technical&#13;
Committee on the Environment (TCE) designed to provide technical and scientific advice to the NCE,&#13;
conduct studies and propose standards and guidelines for environmental control and management. At the&#13;
District level, there is provision for the appointment of a District Environmental Officer (DEO) to work&#13;
through the District Development Committee (DDC). Other committees that have been established&#13;
include the Parliamentary and Cabinet Environment Committee.&#13;
1.25   The Environmental Affairs Department (EAD) within the Ministry of Research and&#13;
Environmental Affairs (MOREA) has the overall mandate for the coordination of environmental&#13;
programs. The specific responsibilities of the EAD are to:&#13;
(a)    act as Secretariat to the National Council for the Environment;&#13;
-6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   in close collaboration with line ministries, formulate environmental policies and&#13;
strategies and advise government;&#13;
(c)    assist line ministries to integrate environmental considerations in their sector strategies;&#13;
(d)    collaborate with macro-economic authorities to establish natural resources accounting&#13;
systems;&#13;
(e)    coordinate with all stakeholders in environmental management;&#13;
(f)    advise concerned ministries and other agencies on environmental regulations;&#13;
enforcement and compliance, assist in arbitration in environmental issues;&#13;
(g)    monitor adherence to international environmental treaties;&#13;
(h)    develop environmental information systems (EIS);&#13;
(i)    promote environmental training, education and public awareness;&#13;
(j)    support initiatives in decentralization as they relate to environmental management; and,&#13;
(k)    coordinate preparation of regular "state of the environment" report.&#13;
1.26   The Environmental Affairs Department is a "light" structure which has been restructured to&#13;
comprise four Divisions: Monitoring and Management, responsible for monitoring, environmental&#13;
impact assessments and pollution control; Education and Outreach; Policy and Planning and Legal which&#13;
includes legislation and regulations, compliance and enforcement, and international conventions (see&#13;
Annex 1). The EAD is being strengthened and its 18 established positions were fully staffed by&#13;
July/August 1996.&#13;
1.27   The EAD is responsible for coordination of cross-sectoral environmental matters.&#13;
Implementation of projects and programs is the responsibility of technical ministries, departments and&#13;
other implementing organizations. The Ministry of Natural Resources, comprising the Departments of&#13;
Forestry, Fisheries and National Parks and Wildlife are primarily responsible for these natural resources,&#13;
while the Ministry of Agriculture has responsibility for agricultural extension, research and soil&#13;
conservation. The Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development has primary responsibility for water&#13;
resources in Malawi, together with the national Water Resources Board. The Ministry of Energy and&#13;
Mining has overall responsibility for energy policy and planning.&#13;
1.28   A network of environmental focal points has been established in each of the appropriate&#13;
implementing agencies, consisting of senior staff who will be permanent contact points for EAD. These&#13;
focal points will have specific responsibilities for coordinating environmental activities and bring major&#13;
environmental issues to the attention of the EAD, and will receive specific training in environmental&#13;
planning, management and EIA. Linkages are also being developed with local governments&#13;
(municipalities and Districts). Agreement was reached during negotiations on the official designation of&#13;
the focal points (para. 6.1 (d)).&#13;
1.29  In parallel with the EAD, there is an apex environmental NGO, CURE (Coordinating Unit for the&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Environment). CURE provides a coordinating and information dissemination&#13;
function for environmental NGOs, many of which worked on refugee and relief programs. CURE has&#13;
also provided training in participatory appraisal techniques, and serves as a clearing house for&#13;
information on environmental activities being undertaken by NGOs and community-based organizations.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA&#13;
1.30   The Environmental Agenda has been well identified in Malawi through the highly participatory&#13;
processes of the NEAP and the ESP. In the face of the many constraints, reversing or slowing down&#13;
-7 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
environmental degradation in Malawi will be a complex challenge for which there are no easy answers or&#13;
quick solutions. The process of tackling the policy and legislative issues is well advanced and much&#13;
progress has been made in establishing the institutional framework. Maintaining the momentum to&#13;
strengthen the institutions concerned is now essential to implement the new legislative framework. A&#13;
key element of the agenda will be to translate the good intentions expressed in the policy into the&#13;
effective empowerment of local communities.&#13;
1.31   As highlighted by the ESP Roundtable, the most critical points of emphasis on the agenda&#13;
include: effective participation of the population, requiring the implementation of new approaches to&#13;
environmental management which empower and provide capacity to communities; capacity building at&#13;
all levels (communities, government and non-government structures and organizations); improved&#13;
coordination to ensure that the many interventions by the different actors are working in the same&#13;
direction; significant emphasis on raising environmental awareness through education and&#13;
communication.&#13;
DONOR ASSISTANCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.32   The NEAP and ESP process has already engendered contributions from a range of sources&#13;
including notably, USAID, which has committed about US$40 million in both balance of payments&#13;
resources, in support of policy and institutional changes, and project funding for priority capacity&#13;
building and investment activities. Other donors including UNDP, Japan, EU, KfW/GTZ, UK-ODA,&#13;
DANIDA, Netherlands, and CIDA have contributed to preparation activities and/or have made funding&#13;
commitments to elements defined in the ESP. Total commitments or expressions of interest from donors&#13;
in the broad category of environment amount to about US$120 million over five years. Full details are&#13;
provided in the ESP document.&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.33  IDA's participation in the Environmental Support Programme is based on a major multi-&#13;
stakeholder preparation effort following from a highly participatory NEAP process. This effort has&#13;
drawn from experience in other countries in Africa and elsewhere and from ongoing operations in&#13;
Malawi. Only the GEF/SADC Lake Malawi/Nyasa Biodiversity Conservation Project has been provided&#13;
directly for environmental purposes. However, much of the prior and ongoing IDA lending (agriculture,&#13;
forestry, social infrastructure, urban, water) has a direct impact on the environment. The main lessons,&#13;
including those from similar Environmental Support Programs are: (i) avoid overly ambitious goals and&#13;
try to minimize the inevitable complexity of this kind of program to the extent possible; (ii) set clear&#13;
priorities through a process of consensus building and enhancing ownership of program objectives on the&#13;
part of the relevant stakeholders; (iii) take a highly participatory approach to program preparation and&#13;
implementation; and (iv) start with a modest and flexible program to strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
and initiate the process of change. It has to be recognized that implementing a process of&#13;
environmentally sustainable development is a long-term challenge, particularly when the pre-conditions&#13;
are not favorable. Developing a strong policy, legal and institutional framework for environmental&#13;
planning and management is a critical element in this process. This framework can be expected to&#13;
evolve over time as institutions mature and as programs are implemented. In terms of overall&#13;
environmental management, the key lessons applied to this ESP include the principle that empowerment&#13;
of the groups most closely affected by environmental degradation is a sine qua non. Providing people&#13;
and local communities with the tools (intellectual, physical and legal) to face these challenges requires,&#13;
in most cases, changing traditional (usually top-down and hierarchical) attitudes and practices.&#13;
-8 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.34 The Government's request for IDA assistance is a logical outcome of the partnership between&#13;
Malawi, the Bank, and other donors which has been developed over the past years during the preparation&#13;
of the NEAP and the ESP. To date, the Bank's efforts have been focused on providing support to a&#13;
Malawian-driven process, rather than designing a specific IDA project. With IDA's role being one of&#13;
"lender of last resort", it is only at this stage that the definition of an IDA contribution to the ESP can be&#13;
achieved. Significant progress has already been made towards the development of a sound legal, policy&#13;
and institutional framework, a large measure of consensus and awareness-raising has been achieved, and&#13;
the level of ownership of the overall program is very high. Given the severity of Malawi's&#13;
environmental problems and the likely social and economic impact of continued deterioration of the&#13;
natural environment which could undernine Malawi's growth prospects, fully integrating environmental&#13;
considerations in Malawi's development process is essential. Continued support for environmental&#13;
management is entirely consistent with the Bank's central focus of poverty reduction as expressed in the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). It is also consistent with efforts to decentralize decision-making&#13;
and empower local communities. Finally, ITF's contribution is designed to complement other donor&#13;
interventions in this area and other IDA operations (including National Water Development, Malawi&#13;
Social Action Fund, Agricultural Services, Local Government, and the ongoing adjustment operations).&#13;
2. THE ITF CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM&#13;
OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY&#13;
2.1    The ITF contribution, the Environmental Management Project (EMP), designed to complement&#13;
the activities of other donors, will support the Government of Malawi's efforts to implement the ESP&#13;
which will focus on: (i) strengthening the coordination capacity of MOREA, the ESP's lead agency, and&#13;
improving its regulatory, information management, promotion and coordination capabilities; (ii) a&#13;
broad-based program of environmental education; (iii) promoting a shift in the responsibility for&#13;
sustainable resource management, and the reversal of degradation, to the community level; and (iv)&#13;
supporting initiatives in key areas of environmental degradation. Underpinning the ESP is the&#13;
environment and natural resources management policy and legislative review process supported by&#13;
USAID and UNDP. An important design element is the gradual transfer of the management of natural&#13;
resources from government departments to the local communities. In Malawi, this approach has been&#13;
called "co-management of natural resources". It has been tried on a pilot basis in parts of the country,&#13;
with reasonable success, and has been used more broadly in other countries in Southern Africa.&#13;
Although not proven to work under all circumstances, it presents perhaps the only remaining solution for&#13;
effective natural resource management in the situations of high population density, and weak&#13;
enforcement capability, which prevail in Malawi.&#13;
2.2   The ITF-financed Environmental Management Project, is estimated to cost some US$13.7&#13;
million. ITF would finance four main components (amounts include price and physical contingency&#13;
allowances): (i) Institutional Capacity Building and Strengthening of the Environment Information&#13;
System (US$ 3.0 million); (ii) Environmental Education (US$ 2.0 million); (iii) Community-Based&#13;
Environmental Management (US$ 6.1 million) and (iv) Environmental Actions and Studies (US$ 2.6&#13;
million).&#13;
9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3   Institutional capacity building (US$ 3.0 million). The ESP will be coordinated and monitored&#13;
by MOREA. This component of the EMP would include support for training and operations, to enable it&#13;
to carry out its policy, monitoring and control functions. The training of persons selected as focal points&#13;
in line departments, regional and district administrations and NGOs would also be covered. MOREA's&#13;
information systems, financial and logistical management capabilities would be strengthened. Support&#13;
would include training courses, workshops, vehicles, equipment, technical assistance and operating costs&#13;
as needed. USAID and UNDP are also involved in these activities, in a fashion complementary to the&#13;
ITF. Agreement was reached during negotiations that a training program for MOREA, environmental&#13;
focal points and designated staff in other institutions, will be furnished to IDA by December 31, 1997&#13;
(para. 6.1 (b)). In order for MOREA to fulfill its mandate effectively it will require sufficient contiguous&#13;
office space to house the staff under recruitment. During negotiations the Government indicated that it&#13;
expected this issue to be resolved by December 31, 1997. In addition to general support for institutional&#13;
development, two specific areas of MOREA's activities have been identified for improvement:&#13;
* Environment Information System. A vital aspect of MOREA's role is to monitor the status&#13;
of the country's natural resources, the effectiveness of its resource management programs,&#13;
and to understand the causes of degradation and misuse. The USAID is providing support&#13;
for this function with a technical assistance team, training and equipment through its&#13;
NATURE program, focusing on the Middle Shire Valley. The ITF resources would&#13;
complement the USAID funded activities, and, based on an assessment of effective demand&#13;
for environment and natural resource information, broaden the scope of the information&#13;
system, including information provided by communities involved in formalized resource&#13;
management.&#13;
* Environmental Impact Assessment and Regulation. The regulations governing the&#13;
preparation of environmental assessments are under review by Parliament, and should be&#13;
approved shortly. ITF would support a unit in MOREA charged with reviewing, auditing&#13;
and participating in the environmental impact assessment process. Support would include&#13;
training, technical assistance and equipment necessary to provide the expertise and data&#13;
management capabilities to exercise this function effectively. This activity will rely on the&#13;
information provided through the Environment Information System as well as on the&#13;
awareness created through the Environmental Education component. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations, that the guidelines and regulations for environmental impact&#13;
assessment will be published by December 31, 1997 (para. 6.1 (a)).&#13;
2.4   Environmental education (US$ 2.0 million). The component would draw on the strategy&#13;
developed in a USAID/UNDP/World Bank-funded study carried out in May 1996, and would provide&#13;
resources for both formal and non-formal approaches to building environmental awareness and educating&#13;
the population in the benefits of sound environmental management and the consequences of misuse of&#13;
renewable natural resources. The objectives of this activity are to: (i) increase public environmental&#13;
awareness and participation; (ii) integrate environmental education into the formal education system;&#13;
(iii) improve the quality of environmental information and access to such materials; and (iv) identify&#13;
formal and non-formal systems for dissemination of environmental information, decentralizing this to&#13;
the lowest level. Expenditures would cover such costs as preparing, producing and disseminating&#13;
publications, posters and audiovisual materials on environmental topics, holding workshops, and&#13;
providing input into curriculum design for public and private schools on environmental topics.&#13;
2.5    Community-BasedEnvironmentalManagement (US$ 6.1 million). The objective of the&#13;
component is to develop the capability of communities to manage the natural resources which they&#13;
- 10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
control and depend on for a livelihood. It is founded in the belief that many communities in Malawi&#13;
have the capacity to manage their commonly held resources sustainably, and execute their own&#13;
development projects, but lack the impetus and initial capital to get started. These activities would be&#13;
facilitated through both NGOs and line departments of the Ministries involved in natural resources&#13;
management. To enhance the sustainability of community level natural resources management, it will be&#13;
necessary for communities to benefit directly from these interventions. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that communities who have entered into co-management arrangements for forestry and&#13;
wildlife areas under the ESP to share the revenues earned from the sustainable exploitation of such&#13;
reserves (para. 6.1 (c)). Without fixing a specific percentage going to communities, it was agreed that&#13;
this would be based on experience to date where at least 30 percent of revenues earned are allocated to&#13;
communities.&#13;
2.6    Community Mobilization and Environmental Micro-Projects. This component, to be&#13;
implemented with support from NGOs, would focus on communities capacity building to improve&#13;
environmental management in both rural and urban areas. Small-scale environmental activities, based on&#13;
proposals originating in communities would also be funded. This component would operate under the&#13;
supervision of a Steering Committee. At afirst stage, community level activities would be initiated by&#13;
systematic client consultation and "community mobilization" provided by an NGO and funded under the&#13;
program. In the course of the community mobilization, community environmental management&#13;
committees or equivalent, would be identified or formed. These committees would prepare community&#13;
environmental management plans. At a second stage, these management plans would be financed from a&#13;
"micro-projects" window. These "micro-projects" would be put forward by the community committees.&#13;
As necessary, technical assistance would be provided from an appropriate source (NGO, Government or&#13;
other entity). Selection of communities would be based on a set of criteria indicating environmental&#13;
and/or natural resource problems, potential for successful resource management, and an indication of&#13;
community involvement. During the pilot phase, 16 communities are included in selected Districts.&#13;
Later on, groups of 8 to 10 communities in targeted Districts would be covered (see Annex 4 for details).&#13;
2.7   Forest Resources Co-Management. To overcome encroachment problems and to increase&#13;
production from the Forest Reserves and woodlands owned under customary tenure, communities&#13;
adjacent to the selected reserves and in areas of potential for forest development, would be encouraged to&#13;
enter into agreements with the Forest Department on the co-management of these resources. Such&#13;
communities would be "mobilized" using mechanisms outlined above. The co-management of some of&#13;
the smaller plantations within the Forest Reserves may also be included. On a pilot basis, communities&#13;
with forestry resources would be organized to put in place a sustainable wood production and marketing&#13;
operation. Also, under this component, limited support could be provided to the Forestry Department to&#13;
develop strategies for management of indigenous forests, implementing the Forestry Policy, and&#13;
developing a regional forestry planning capacity. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the&#13;
Government would carry out a functional and expenditure review of the Forestry Department by March&#13;
1998, focusing on disengagement from commercial plantation activities (para. 6.1 (e)).&#13;
2.8    Biodiversity conservation in Protected Areas in the Lower Shire. A system for the co-&#13;
management of wildlife in National Park periphery zones has been developed and practiced in pilot areas&#13;
in Northern Malawi. Using these techniques, ITF would support community capacity building to be&#13;
carried out under the community natural resources co-management program, for the communities&#13;
bordering Protected Areas at Lengwe National Park, Majete and Mwabvi Game Reserves and would&#13;
provide limited support for training of field staff in community-based management techniques.&#13;
Contingent on agreement on the role of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife in support of the&#13;
co-management approach to wildlife management, and on the basis of the community consultative and&#13;
planning process, minimal infrastructure would be rehabilitated in these areas.&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.9    Urban Environmental Management. Urban environmental problems were highlighted in the&#13;
NEAP, and in para. 1.13. IDA would support limited interventions in Lilongwe, Blantyre, Zomba, and&#13;
Mzuzu to complement IDA's current involvement in improving municipal management through the&#13;
ongoing Local Government Development Project. This component would complement other activities in&#13;
urban areas, by focusing on community mobilization through NGOs to develop strategic urban&#13;
environmental service plans, and drawing on the environmental micro-projects funds for community&#13;
based activities such as installation of public water kiosks to be managed by the communities, on-site&#13;
sanitation, urban open space and watercourse reclamation. Limited funding would be included for&#13;
emergency pollution abatement measures, such as the sewage treatment facility in Zomba.&#13;
2.10 EnvironmentalActions and Studies (US$ 2.6 million). IDA would support a series of targeted&#13;
actions in areas of high priority on the environment agenda. These resources are intended to support&#13;
planning and implementation of environmental programs or tackle critical problems, and will be&#13;
allocated through the Annual Work Planning exercise. Planning is well advanced for some of the actions&#13;
which could include:&#13;
* Climate Change and Long Lead Forecasting Pilot. Malawi's rainfed agricultural economy is&#13;
vulnerable to variations in precipitation and temperature. In recent years, dramatic advances&#13;
have been made in understanding the dynamics of the southern Africa climatic regimes and&#13;
how these regimes are connected to global phenomena such as the El Niflo/Southern&#13;
Oscillation (ENSO) events. Improvements in global climate modeling and new understanding&#13;
of ENSO "teleconnections" or links with climate forcing factors, is enabling climate prediction&#13;
to become a practical and applied science. Long lead climate forecasts are now being used in&#13;
various agricultural economies around the world. South Africa has taken the lead in climate&#13;
research and prognostic science. This component would enable the Meteorological Department&#13;
to develop such forecasts, tailored to the needs of key users, some of whom could be expected&#13;
to pay for tailored information.&#13;
*   Water Hyacinth Control. This fast growing weed, present for some years in the Lower Shire,&#13;
has now been sighted in southern Lake Malawi and in the northern portions of the Shire river.&#13;
It threatens to seriously affect fishing, hydropower generation, water transport, water supply&#13;
systems, tourism and biodiversity in the catchment. ODA is financing a thiree year research&#13;
program to establish the effectiveness of biological control methods. The project would&#13;
provide additional finance, to develop the institutional framework and supjport field operations&#13;
needed to deal with the threat. IDA support would be contingent on the commitment of the&#13;
Government to address this environmental problem in a vigorous and holistic manner. A first&#13;
step would be the identification of the appropriate coordination and implemnentation agency for&#13;
a control program which brought together all relevant stakeholders.&#13;
*  Bilharzia Control. This debilitating disease is endemic in parts of Malawi, and has recently&#13;
appeared in certain locations along Lake Malawi. Infection rates are high in water side&#13;
locations, especially among young people. The disease can be contracted at some of Malawi's&#13;
most valuable tourist sites. In addition to affecting the health of the exposed populations, the&#13;
disease will affect the revenue earning ability of lake-side resorts, an important source of&#13;
foreign exchange for the country. Eradication of bilharzia requires a multi-faceted approach&#13;
involving health education, fisheries regulation, snail habitat treatment, waiter supply and&#13;
sanitation improvements, and medical treatment of infected patients. A national program for&#13;
bilharzia abatement is under review by the World Bank, for funding under health related&#13;
operations and within the context of Malawi's overall health program. Support for further&#13;
preparatory and pilot activities could be funded from this project.&#13;
* Lake Malawi National Park. This park on the Nankumba peninsula requires improved&#13;
management and infrastructure. Studies of the park have been carried out with CIDA and GEF&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financing. The project would provide additional finance to put in place the actions&#13;
recommended by the studies (such as improving waste treatment in the lakeside villages,&#13;
relocation of certain facilities). Such support would depend on agreement between&#13;
Govemment and the enclave communities on a suitable approach to park management.&#13;
*   Supportfor the Policy Planning Unit (PPU) in the Ministry of Lands and Valuation. With the&#13;
establishment and operation of the Presidential Land Commission, the demands placed on the&#13;
PPU, for policy, analytical and implementation of the Land Commission recommendations will&#13;
increase. In order for the PPU to be able to respond to this growing demand, resources will be&#13;
needed for additional logistical support and short-term assistance.&#13;
3. PROJECT COSTING AND FINANCING&#13;
COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.1     The total cost of the EMP is estimated at US$ 13.7 million, including physical contingencies&#13;
estimated at US$ 0.6 million and price contingencies at US$ 0.7 million over the 5 year implementation&#13;
period. Cost estimates exclude taxes and duties. The base exchange rate was Kwacha 15 for one US&#13;
dollar (June 1996). The distribution of local and foreign costs by component is shown below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent per annum over the 5 year life of the credit. It is assumed that the local exchange rate would&#13;
adjust to compensate for differences between local and international inflation.&#13;
FINANCING&#13;
3.3    The ITF would finance 90 percent of expenditures, with a credit of US$ 12.4 million. The&#13;
Government would contribute some 10 percent of total expenditures by providing an increasing share of&#13;
local costs, principally operating costs and allowances, and the costs of local training efforts. A&#13;
financing table, by type of expenditure, is shown below.&#13;

PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.4    Procurement of works and goods for all ITF-financed components shall be ijn accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," published January 1995, and&#13;
revised in January 1996 and August 1996 and shall be subject to the restrictions for the Interim Trust&#13;
Fund (ITF). World Bank Standard Bidding and Contract documents shall be used for all ICB and&#13;
consultant contracts. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.&#13;
3.5    Works. The Category of Works includes civil works for the construction of small buildings&#13;
within three protected areas and the rehabilitation of some 50 km of minor roads. Contracts are expected&#13;
to be small, and unlikely to attract interest from international bidders. Civil works contracts estimated to&#13;
cost equivalent of US$500,000 or less per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million may be&#13;
procured through contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB), in accordance&#13;
with the procedures satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
3.6    Goods. Procurement of vehicles and equipment by several implementing agencies, wherever&#13;
practicable, shall be combined into single contract(s) of US$100,000 or more and would be procured&#13;
through ICB. Furniture, office equipment and supplies would be procured under NCB procedures for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 up to a total of US$300,000 in aggregate. Contracts on&#13;
goods estimated to cost less than US$30,000 may be procured using national shopping, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$300,000. Goods, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$300,000 may be&#13;
procured through the United Nations Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO).&#13;
3.7    Consulting Services. Institutional, environmental, feasibility and other studies would be carried&#13;
out by consultants to be employed by the respective implementing agencies, whose qualifications,&#13;
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA. Consultants shall be&#13;
engaged in accordance with the "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as an Executing Agency", published August 1981, and will also be subject to ITF&#13;
restrictions. Letter of Invitation (LOI) and Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services&#13;
(published by the World Bank in June 1995) or other similar forms shall be used wherever applicable.&#13;
Local and foreign experts may be recruited in specialized fields to assist in community mobilization and&#13;
-14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
co-management, environmental information systems, environmental education and other environment&#13;
related fields, finance and training. Recruitment of NGOs under the Community Mobilization&#13;
Component will be managed by the MOREA, and such NGOs will be contracted for the provision of&#13;
training and other services. No government salaries will be funded under the project. Where staff are&#13;
engaged in project related field work, personnel allowances (per diems) will be paid using Government&#13;
approved standards. No sitting allowances will be paid.&#13;
3.8     Micro-Project Grants. Goods and works, estimated to cost less than US$20,000 and up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 1,000,000 financed under the micro-projects grants component will be procured&#13;
directly by communities and NGOs in accordance with the provisions of para. 3.15 of the Guidelines and&#13;
the modalities set out in the PIP. These grants, authorized by the steering committee, would cover such&#13;
expenditures as: small-scale construction materials, inputs for establishment of nurseries, protection of&#13;
woodland areas and watercourse reclamation, improved drainage and sanitation, and installation of&#13;
public water kiosks.&#13;

3.9     Prior Review Procedures and Reporting. The Annual Workplan prepared each year by the&#13;
implementing agencies for review by IDA shall include details of the items to be procured (goods and&#13;
services) and the procedures to be adopted for such procurement within the limits given earlier and to be&#13;
agreed by IDA. Requirements for IDA's prior review of procurement are as follows:&#13;
(a)     Procurement of Goods. and Civil Works Contracts. Invitation for bidding, draft bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation and award recommendations, for all contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 for each contract, would all be subject to prior review and no objection by&#13;
IDA;&#13;
(b)     Contracts with Consulting Firms and Individual Consultants (Technical Assistance&#13;
Personnel). Terms of reference for all consultant services would be subject to prior&#13;
review and approval by IDA. Budgets, shortlists, selection procedures, letters of&#13;
invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or&#13;
more for consulting firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals would be subject to&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prior review and approval by IDA. All sole source contracts and amendments to&#13;
contracts raising the contract value for firmns above US$ 100,000 and individuals above&#13;
US$50,000 shall be subject to prior review and clearance by IDA;&#13;
(c)    Specific training activities would be undertaken in accordance with an annual training&#13;
program reviewed and approved by IDA;&#13;
(d)    Contracts below the prior review threshold would be subject to ex-post review by IDA&#13;
on a selected basis (one in five).&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.10   The proposed ITF Credit of SDR 8.7 million would be disbursed over five years with an&#13;
expected Project Completion Date of June 30, 2002 and a Closing Date of December 31, 2002.&#13;
3.11   Disbursement Procedures. Disbursements from the Credit would be in accordance with the&#13;
normal IDA procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook (November 1992). Once agreement has&#13;
been reached on the annual work program and budgets with the implementing agencies (MOREA, MNR,&#13;
NGOs) disbursements from the credit can be made following the standard procedures, including:&#13;
reimbursement of expenses incurred by implementing agencies against submission of disbursement&#13;
requests, direct payment to suppliers or replenishment of special accounts. Disbursement for&#13;
expenditures under the Micro-project component would require that appropriate arrangements had been&#13;
entered into between the Government and the community concerned (para. 6.3).&#13;
3.12   MOREA will centralize the disbursement procedures for the implementing agencies involved in&#13;
implementation of ITF-financed components. Agreement was reached during negotiations that a&#13;
Financial Controller and a Procurement Officer with expertise in the management of IDA-financed&#13;
projects will be stationed, by credit effectiveness, in MOREA's Administration and Gjeneral Department&#13;
for the initial years of the project to facilitate the management of the Special Account, as well as&#13;
procurement procedures and financial reporting (para. 6.2 (a)).&#13;
3.13   To facilitate disbursement, IDA will advance US$1,000,000 into a Special Account, in&#13;
convertible currency opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Upon effectiveness the advance&#13;
amounts will be deposited to the respective Special Account against disbursement application(s).&#13;
Reimbursements should be grouped for replenishment of these Special Accounts and submitted for&#13;
reimbursement every month or whenever the Special Account balances are reduced to one third of the&#13;
original amount, whichever comes first, through the standard channel of disbursement procedures for the&#13;
Special Accounts. The account may be used to pay for expenditures in either local or foreign currencies&#13;
through the commercial banking system, against any category of expenditure. All replenishments should&#13;
be fully documented except in the case where statements of expenditure (SOEs) are authorized.&#13;
3.14   The implementation agencies may claim reimbursements on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for:&#13;
(a)    Civil works costing less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(b)    Goods costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(c)    Training, consultants contracts, studies and operating costs for single items costing less&#13;
than US$100,000 equivalent for firms, and less than US$ 50,000 for individuals.&#13;
- 16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.15   The respective implementing agency shall retain all the relevant supporting documentation for&#13;
reimbursements of SOEs for inspection by IDA. During the course of the annual audit of the Project&#13;
Accounts, the auditors shall certify that all expenditures claimed under SOE.&#13;

percentages are calculated taking into consideration the identifiable taxes and duties.&#13;
ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
3.17   The implementing agencies would maintain separate records and financial accounts for the ITF-&#13;
financed components, using generally accepted accounting principles. A set of consolidated financial&#13;
accounts would be prepared every year. Responsibility for preparation of the component accounts would&#13;
rest with the financial controller appointed for this purpose in the implementing agency for each&#13;
component. The ITF-financed Financial Controller in MOREA would consolidate the financial&#13;
statements for ITF-funded activities, and arrange for the annual audit of the accounts in MOREA and the&#13;
relevant implementing agencies. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the accounts for each&#13;
of the components would be audited by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.1 (g)). A&#13;
certified copy of the accounts, together with the auditors management report, would be submitted to IDA&#13;
within 6 months of the end of the financial year. The certificate would include a statement covering the&#13;
adequacy of the records and accounts used to support disbursements against Statements of Expenditure.&#13;
4. PROGRAM ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.1    The National Council for the Environment will be a high level statutory body under the&#13;
Environment Management Act, empowered to "recommend to the Minister (of Research and&#13;
Environmental Affairs) measures necessary for the harmonization of activities, plans and policies of lead&#13;
agencies and non-governmental organizations concerned with the protection and management of the&#13;
- 17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
environment and the conservation and sustainable utilization of natural resources."1 The leader of the&#13;
Council will be appointed by the President. The Council will also include the Secretary to the President&#13;
and Cabinet, all the Principal Secretaries, a member from the Malawi Chamber of Commerce, a member&#13;
from the NGO community, and other high level officials. The Council will make recommendations to&#13;
the Minister on all key policy decisions related to environmental management, and set the stage for the&#13;
coordination of environmental activities under the Program, of which the proposed IDA project is a&#13;
portion.&#13;
4.2   In addition, a Technical Committee on the Environment (of between 10 and 20 members) will be&#13;
formed under the Council, to provide more detailed inputs into the Program, recommending on criteria&#13;
and standards for environmental control and regulation, and taking the lead in recommending studies or&#13;
mitigation actions. This will provide a "working forum" for members of the various agencies engaged in&#13;
the implementation of the ESP to resolve coordination difficulties and address common issues.&#13;
4.3    The Environmental Affairs Department in MOREA will have the main responsibility for&#13;
coordinating the ESP, including the IDA-financed activities. However, other than training its own staff,&#13;
developing capacity, enforcing Environmental Impact Assessment legislation and managing the&#13;
Environment Information System, this Department will not be responsible for the direct implementation&#13;
of any program components.&#13;
4.4    Project activities will be carried out by NGOs, by the line departments in the Ministry of Natural&#13;
Resources (Forestry, National Parks and Wildlife, and Fisheries), and by other agencies (e.g.,&#13;
Meteorology Department). The Water Hyacinth Component is likely to be implemented under contract&#13;
with an international research institute. The network of designated Environment Focal Point staff&#13;
(stationed in participating agencies) will be trained to deal with environmental issues and information&#13;
management, and will be responsible for the transmittal of environment and natural resource information&#13;
to MOREA. Other training, including community mobilization and co-management techniques will be&#13;
provided to the relevant field level staff in the line ministry departments, and to the NGOs participating&#13;
in the program.&#13;
4.5    The Community Environmental Mobilization and Micro-Projects component would be managed&#13;
through the Outreach Unit of MOREA, which would be strengthened for this purpose, and supervised by&#13;
a Steering Committee drawn from the public sector (including MOREA), the private sector, and the&#13;
NGO community. Agreement was reached at negotiations that proposals for NGO based "mobilization"&#13;
of villages, and for financing village environment and natural resource action plans and micro-projects&#13;
would be approved by the Steering Committee. Funds would be granted to the village, which would&#13;
contract services from NGOs or other providers as necessary. These activities are complementary to the&#13;
activities financed under Malawi's Social Action Fund (run by a Government department). Activities&#13;
would be reviewed to ensure that the interventions are sensitive to gender. Model contracts will be&#13;
prepared between MOREA and the NGOs for the community mobilization, training and micro-projects&#13;
activities, and the modalities for administration and management of this component will be spelled out in&#13;
the PIP. Agreement was reached at negotiations that, prior to disbursement of funds for the micro-&#13;
projects component, the Government and the communities would enter into arrangements set out in the&#13;
PIP covering the terms and conditions for the use of the grants (para. 6.3).&#13;
4.6   ITF/IDA funding will be allocated to the various components on the basis of an Environment&#13;
Management Project Annual Workplan and Budget, prepared by the participating agencies, and&#13;
submitted to MOREA (and the Ministry of Finance) for review and approval. This document would be&#13;
based on the Project Implementation Plan, adoption of which is a Condition of Effectiveness (para. 6.2&#13;
Environment Management Act, 1996, Section 12 (c).&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b). It will be reviewed annually by IDA and other participating donors, and this exercise, to be&#13;
completed by March 31 of each year, would be the key tool for ensuring focus, compatibility and&#13;
complementarity amongst the many activities supported under the program by the various donors.&#13;
Where feasible, funding will be based on the attainment of results specified in advance. Agreement was&#13;
reached at Negotiations that a draft of the Annual Workplan would be submitted to IDA for review and&#13;
comment by January 31 st of each year, and the final Annual Workplan would be submitted by March&#13;
31 st of each year. The Workplans for other activities under the ESP, which support and complement the&#13;
activities under the Project, would be submitted to IDA by January 31 of each year (para. 6.1 (f)).&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.7    A strong monitoring and evaluation system will be part of the program. The monitoring and&#13;
budgeting system would be linked to ensure that the successful activities receive continued support.&#13;
Disbursements of funds to implementing agencies would be linked to the fulfillment of monitorable&#13;
indicators. Methods for enhancing the sustainability of the program would be investigated and built into&#13;
implementation mechanisms where appropriate. One feature of the ESP will be to strengthen the&#13;
Environmental Information System, in order to track environmentally important features in hot spots&#13;
around the country. In addition, through the Annual Workplan exercise, a series of monitorable&#13;
implementation indicators will be established which will allow MOREA to track the implementation&#13;
effectiveness of the collaborating agencies and NGOs. One important feature will be to bring in the&#13;
communities involved in improved natural resource management under the program to contribute their&#13;
observations on natural resource status and use to the national monitoring system. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that the Government would submit progress reports on the implementation of the&#13;
Project every six months, and provide progress reports on the ESP every year starting December 31,&#13;
1997 (para. 6.1(h)). Agreement was also reached during negotiations on key indicators, for inclusion in&#13;
the progress reports. A set of draft performance indicators are shown in Annex 7.&#13;
MID-TERM AND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REVIEW&#13;
4.8   The ESP and the ITF/IDA-financed contribution are inherently complex ventures, due to the&#13;
need to address environmental problems in a holistic fashion, and hence to engage a large number of&#13;
stakeholders in addressing such problems. There will be a large number of implementing agencies&#13;
supporting activities spread out in the "hot spots" for environmental action around the country. It is&#13;
essential that a thorough, zero-based, Mid-Term review of the Environment Support Program and the&#13;
ITF/IDA contribution, be undertaken with the participation of all the major stakeholders. This review&#13;
should assess the effectiveness of the activities designed to strengthen the institutional framework for&#13;
environment management (and the effectiveness of MOREA in particular), as well as the effectiveness of&#13;
the NGOs and the community level activities, and progress in carrying out the various studies, and&#13;
putting in place a response to recommendations. The outcome of this review should be brought to the&#13;
attention of the National Council for the Environment, as well as high level representatives in donor&#13;
organizations, so that measures can be taken to address fundamental problems, including adjustments in&#13;
implementation responsibilities, fund management and allocations as needed. Agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations that preliminary documentation for a joint Mid-Term review would be prepared for&#13;
IDA review by December 31, 1999 (para. 6.1(i)). By June 30, 2000 a Mid-Term Review will have been&#13;
carried out and an action plan drawn up with a timetable for implementation of agreed recommendations.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PLAN&#13;
4.9   The IDA commitment to implementation support of the ITF/IDA contribution to the ESP will&#13;
have to be very intensive, particularly at the early stages. The complexity of the decentralized&#13;
- 19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation network, and the need to nurture the development of the lead agency, MOREA, require&#13;
that attention be paid to this project from persons with a range of environmental expertise. In particular,&#13;
support will be needed over the first three years in institutional strengthening (for MOREA), in the&#13;
establishment of the procedures for Environmental Impact Assessment, in the setting up of the&#13;
Environmental Information System, and in the implementation of the community nmobilization and co-&#13;
management activities. Also, given the lack of prior exposure to IDA procurement and disbursement&#13;
regulations in the lead ministry, implementation support missions should include expertise in these areas&#13;
to ensure that the appropriate systems are set up, and correct procedures followed from the start of the&#13;
project. The World Bank Resident Mission will play a critical role in this effort, complemented by three&#13;
implementation support missions planned for the first two years of implementation staffed to address&#13;
these issues (Annex 5).&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
PROGRAM IMPACT&#13;
5.1    The Environmental Support Programme is designed as a long-term response to the problems of&#13;
environmental degradation in Malawi. The purpose is to integrate environmental considerations in the&#13;
overall development of the country. This is essential to reduce the cost and impact of unsustainable&#13;
exploitation and deterioration of the natural environment which not only undermines Malawi's growth&#13;
prospects in all sectors - including agriculture, tourism, industry, fishing - but also jeopardizes current&#13;
production levels and diminishes the quality of life for the citizens of Malawi.&#13;
5.2   The proposed program will help Malawi face these challenges. It will contribute to the&#13;
strengthening of the institutional and policy framework, enhance public awareness, and promote pilot&#13;
community-based initiatives in environmental protection and conservation. The prcgram will help&#13;
Malawi implement the EIA process to ensure that environmental considerations are fully integrated in&#13;
future investment in Malawi. The ESP is also expected to contribute to the process already underway of&#13;
empowering local communities and developing new ways of doing business which have more direct&#13;
poverty reduction impact.&#13;
RISKS&#13;
5.3   The three major risks to program implementation are noted below. The first relates to the&#13;
relative newness and limited resources of the central coordinating unit - the EAD in MOREA. These&#13;
factors coupled with the weak overall capacity in the public sector, and the potential fragmentation of&#13;
effort induced by the plethora of donor interventions, could impede effective implementation of the ESP.&#13;
Key factors and specific measures to mitigate these risks include: maintaining a coordination-only&#13;
function for the EAD, with implementation the responsibility of sectoral ministries; capacity building&#13;
and institutional strengthening for the EAD and line ministries are included as explicit objectives of the&#13;
ESP, and funding for this will be assured by USAID, UNDP, IDA and other donors; decentralization to&#13;
the lowest possible level of all pilot investment activities, with specific focus on developing community-&#13;
based organizations and NGOs. On the question of fragmentation of effort, the ESP has been elaborated&#13;
with one specific objective being donor coordination. Willingness to pool efforts and contribute to an&#13;
overall process has been strongly manifested by the entire donor community. Maintaining this&#13;
willingness will require continued effort by the EAD, and coordination mechanisms have been developed&#13;
during the preparation of the ESP. It should also be noted that strong demand for an influential&#13;
environmental coordinating unit has been expressed at all levels of Malawian society.&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.4    The second refers to the nature of environmental programs, which are cross-sectoral and involve&#13;
many stakeholders. These features, together with the demands for institutional capacity development,&#13;
inevitably lead to some complexity and uncertainty in the design and implementation of specific&#13;
investments. Key mitigating factors include: design flexibility to accommodate changes as lessons are&#13;
learned from implementation experience; decentralization to the extent possible; operating agreements&#13;
between the different entities involved in program implementation (e.g., the Community Mobilization&#13;
and Micro-Project Pilot Activities); use of existing institutions rather than creating new ones.&#13;
5.5    The third relates to the fact that improving environmental management over the medium to long&#13;
term will mean changing the incentive structure with respect to the management of natural resources.&#13;
Inevitably there are competing interests in the use, ownership and benefits to be derived from natural&#13;
resources such as water, land, forestry, wildlife, and fisheries. However, it is by no means certain that&#13;
conflicting interests can always be reconciled. Policy changes which enable local communities to derive&#13;
much greater benefits from sustainable use of natural resources are a necessary condition to improved&#13;
environmental management, but effectively empowering communities requires more than a policy&#13;
decision, and does not happen overnight. The ESP aims to test and develop the concepts of community&#13;
management and empowerment, as perhaps the only remaining solution to improved natural resources&#13;
management in Malawi. Significant uncertainties, particularly over access to land and other resources,&#13;
remain, and long term political will is a critical determinant of success in this endeavor. The recent&#13;
creation of the Presidential Land Commission will help address the questions of ownership, but the&#13;
potential for conflict over natural resources remains high.&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.6    The proposed IDA project, which is directed largely towards institutional strengthening and pilot&#13;
programs, is not susceptible to detailed cost-benefit analysis and rate of return calculation. No attempt is&#13;
made to reorder or assign priorities to specific interventions in the ESP. However, several attempts have&#13;
been made to estimate the overall economic value of environmental products and damages in Malawi, as&#13;
a means of both highlighting the importance of natural resources to the Malawian real economy and of&#13;
helping to order priorities for intervention. The NEAP itself contains preliminary estimates of damages&#13;
related to environmental degradation, and the ESP document discusses the economic implications of a&#13;
"4no-action" state. The estimates present (in 1994 market prices) the annual costs of the four highest&#13;
priority environmental problems as follows:&#13;
*   soil erosion ($165 million)&#13;
* deforestation ($55 million)&#13;
* water pollution and lack of sanitation ($15 million)&#13;
* degradation of fisheries ($4 million)&#13;
5.7    These estimates are based on very sketchy data and extrapolation from data in other countries&#13;
(e.g., Nigeria), with the result that they are probably only of illustrative value. More recently, a review&#13;
of available data on soil erosion and deforestation in the analytical framework of "Genuine Savings",&#13;
indicates that the rates of genuine savings in Malawi, in a worst case scenario, have ranged from 7% to&#13;
19% since 1980. This compares to a savings ratio of about zero over the same period using the standard&#13;
measure (National Accounts) of net savings (i.e. national savings less the value of depreciation of&#13;
produced assets). Other environmental problems, particularly water resources degradation and&#13;
associated health impacts may, however, be of much greater significance.&#13;
5.8    Preliminary analysis, during the preparation of the ESP, has examined the damage costs of two&#13;
specific problems - water hyacinth infestation and bilharzia. Although difficult to fully quantify, the&#13;
gross economic value of the fisheries at risk from water hyacinth in the Middle and Lower Shire rivers is&#13;
-21 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$1-2 million. To this should be added the potential cost of clearing intakes for the hydropower plants,&#13;
and water supply schemes for domestic and industrial use, obstruction of waterborne transport, and&#13;
increased health hazards (mosquitoes, snakes, crocodiles). In the case of bilharzia, studies have&#13;
demonstrated the significant economic losses associated with infection (through loss of working days).&#13;
In addition, bilharzia is likely to have an impact on Malawi's tourism industry which is estimated to&#13;
generate about US$8 million per annum in value added. Since the Lake Malawi environment captures&#13;
about 70% of tourist time, the threat of bilharzia could have a major impact on tourism revenues, and&#13;
would at least dampen growth. Economic analysis of the problem of degradation of the Middle Shire&#13;
River catchment and siltation of the Shire River is included in Annex 8.&#13;
5.9    These examples only give a broad indication of the costs and likely benefits of environmental&#13;
damage and interventions. Much work is needed to determine the benefits which accrue to individual&#13;
households and to the economy at large. As an integral part of the ESP, training (e.g., in environmental&#13;
economics) and capacity building (e.g., in EIS) are included to help develop the data and analytical&#13;
capacity to improve the quantitative justification for tackling Malawi's environmental problems.&#13;
Through the use of analytical tools such as the "Genuine Savings" model, efforts will be made to "green"&#13;
national income accounts, as provided for under the Environmental Management Act.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.10   The highly participatory NEAP and the ESP preparation processes, have led to very broad&#13;
ownership of the objectives and principles contained within them, and the need for sustained support to&#13;
improving environmental management in Malawi. In the short- to medium-term, donor assistance will&#13;
be essential to implement the ESP, since Malawi is dependent on external financing for more than 95%&#13;
of the public investment budget. Ultimately, it will not be through the application of marginal additional&#13;
resources that sustainability will be achieved, but through the overall development process. There is&#13;
agreement that responsibilities need to be devolved to the lowest level possible, and that it is the duty of&#13;
all citizens and entities in Malawi to play a role in environmental management. Forging a path towards&#13;
environmentally sustainable development will require a continuing process of adjustment over a&#13;
prolonged period, together with a redirection of resource flows consistent with those actions. This&#13;
process is not likely to be a smooth transition because of its inherently political nature.&#13;
5.11   An important feature of the project is its focus on capacity building at the community level, and&#13;
the creation of the social capital and the incentive structure sufficient to induce sustainable use of&#13;
community natural resources. If this is successful, the pressure to continue Government-funded&#13;
programs will diminish. Once the "one off' investment in community mobilization has been made&#13;
(through NGOs), and small additional investments in community natural resource action plans have been&#13;
put in place, the returns in terms of behavior by community members, and the results in terms of the&#13;
sustainability of resource management should be visible. A key feature of the approach is that the&#13;
communities perceive, and receive, tangible benefits from adopting a more conservationist and&#13;
sustainable approach to resource management, on wildlife, forests, fish or soil. In particular, revenues&#13;
from eco-tourism, or harvesting of wildlife or forest products should be shared with the local&#13;
communities.&#13;
5.12   In the design of the ITF/IDA contribution to the ESP, care has been taken to ensure that the&#13;
recurrent costs associated will be minimized. Much of the capacity building expenditure represents one-&#13;
off training and complementary expenditure to support other donor activities in existing institutions.&#13;
Recurrent cost implications, while minimal, will be progressively taken over by the national budget. For&#13;
the line departments, particularly the Departments of Forestry and National Parks and Wildlife,&#13;
improving revenue flows can be accomplished through increased stumpage rates for commercial forest&#13;
exploitation, and through proceeds from enhanced tourism. Privatization or concession-leasing of forest&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
resources (e.g., Viphya), and of National Parks or Game Reserves (e.g., Mwabvi or Majete) together with&#13;
improved revenue retention and distribution mechanisms provide another model for financial&#13;
sustainability. No staff would be added to MOREA or MNR, although the filling of important vacancies&#13;
would be an important condition for continued IDA involvement. ITF/IDA funding would complement&#13;
Government's resources and improve the operational capabilities of existing institutions with training,&#13;
improved equipment and operating cost finance. The implication is that, after 5 years of implementation,&#13;
the current annual operating budget of MOREA (about US$ 300,000) would have increased by 70%. It&#13;
is expected that this additional resource requirement, in support of a new and important Government&#13;
function, will not be difficult to meet.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
ESP - ROUNDTABLE&#13;
(Malawi Institute of Management - 7-8 May)&#13;
1.    The ESP Roundtable was attended by a broad group of representatives of agencies of local and&#13;
central governments, NGOs, donors and the media. The purpose of the Roundtable was to:&#13;
(a)    gain general understanding and acceptance of the programme approach to the execution&#13;
of the Environmental Support Programme - led by the Malawi Government - under a&#13;
common policy umbrella;&#13;
(b)    broaden an understanding of the various environment related programmes and projects&#13;
currently underway;&#13;
(c)   identify key issues in the execution of the ESP, and develop a consensus on how to deal&#13;
with them;&#13;
(d)   contribute to the development of a common approach to standard elements of the&#13;
programme (such as micro-projects, community natural resources co-management,&#13;
environmental education); and&#13;
(e)   identify donor support for different elements of the ESP.&#13;
2.    The Roundtable was professionally facilitated and involved the use of computerized groupware&#13;
to identify and discuss key issues. 1/ Priority issues were identified and working groups were established&#13;
to discuss the top seven in detail and make recommendations for action. These were:&#13;
*  Participation was identified as the top priority for improved environmental management.&#13;
Specific emphasis was given to facilitating the development of community action plans and&#13;
effectively empowering local communities. Key recommendations and proposed actions&#13;
included the need to change from the top-down planning approach, to inform and educate&#13;
local communities, through NGOs, and providing a mechanism to channel funds to&#13;
communities. It was recommended that the existing community structures be used to the&#13;
maximum extent possible, and that training be provided at all levels.&#13;
*   Capacity building: proposed actions included identifying and prioritizing skills gaps at all&#13;
levels including local communities, NGOs, MOREA and line ministries, followed by putting&#13;
in place training programs with intensive use of local training institutions. Capacity&#13;
development for the implementation of the Environmental Support Program should also be&#13;
tied to improved performance and the use of monitorable indicators. Funds for capacity&#13;
building at all levels should be disbursed on the basis of good performance. Information&#13;
management is central to the development of environmental management capacity.&#13;
*   Coordination of the different activities in environmental management was seen as critical&#13;
for the successful implementation of the ESP. The working group recommended that&#13;
A full Roundtable Report is available on file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MOREA should be strengthened to carry out its functions, and that the ESP is the main tool&#13;
for MOREA to coordinate priorities. The key action proposed was for MOREA together&#13;
with the Ministry of Finance and EP&amp;D to arrange regular meetings with donors. Other&#13;
recommendations included: reviewing MOREA's coordination capacity and preparing an&#13;
action plan for strengthening it; rationalization of working groups and cornmittees, and&#13;
provision of the resources to meet and to carry out their functions; organization of regular&#13;
coordination meetings with key stakeholders; strengthening links between CURE and&#13;
MOREA; more effort by CURE to work in the Northern and Central Regions; demonstration&#13;
of commitment by donors towards being coordinated; regularly updating the Environmental&#13;
Focal Point Directory; using the EIA process and Environmental Informat.ion Systems to&#13;
improve coordination and monitoring of the environment; examining opportunities for a&#13;
single monitoring and evaluation process and annual reporting system for the ESP.&#13;
* Environmental Education should be aimed at all levels of society, both through formal and&#13;
non-formal education channels. Specific actions proposed included: development of a&#13;
national environmental education strategy; promotion of innovative ways of informing the&#13;
population through audio-visual, radio, and traditional media, using daily life experiences;&#13;
establishment of environmental education steering committees; training and sensitization of&#13;
leaders at the local and national levels; MOREA to play a coordinating role for the&#13;
promotion of EE; donors should support the implementation of the strategy. (The&#13;
Roundtable was able to provide additional input for environmental education and&#13;
communication strategy developed and jointly funded by the UNDP, USAID, and the WB.&#13;
* Water Resources Management was one of three priority thematic areas of concern in&#13;
environmental management. The key recommendation was to consider the establishment of&#13;
a river basin management system, with catchment stakeholder groups. A combination of&#13;
regulation (policies, legislation and enforcement) and positive incentives was proposed for&#13;
catchment protection. Water quality control policies and regulations should be implemented&#13;
or established where they do not exist. Existing programmes for water hyacinth control and&#13;
Bilharzia eradication should be strengthened with increased resources.&#13;
i Land Degradation was the second major thematic area. The key recommendation for action&#13;
was to take a community development approach to combat land degradation and&#13;
deforestation, building on NGO and community based organization efforts. Critical areas&#13;
identified included the Middle Shire, the area around Lake Chilwa and the Nankumba&#13;
Peninsular. Rather than developing new Government run projects in the Middle Shire,&#13;
efforts should build on existing programs. Key actions included: making an inventory of all&#13;
NGO and government current activities in the areas identified; define target areas and&#13;
activities; identify stakeholders and establish coordination mechanisms; find financing for&#13;
these activities. Other recommendations focused on the need to use indigenous knowledge&#13;
and cultural practices, and to review existing training programs and facilities to maximize&#13;
use of local facilities and resources to develop capacity in this area. The need to improve the&#13;
national capacity to adapt to climate change and drought through the use oiF improved&#13;
meteorological information was also recommended.&#13;
* Urban Settlement environmental issues were highlighted. Key recommendations included:&#13;
the need to review the effectiveness of existing national policies on urban land tenure and&#13;
management of infrastructure and services; capacity building at the community level to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
identify problems, and plan and manage urban infrastructure and services; financing of&#13;
future urban service provision to be tied to community and other lead agencies'&#13;
organization, participation and cooperation. These activities should be coordinated by the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government, MOREA, the Ministry of Housing and Local Authorities.&#13;
3.    Other issues raised (but not discussed in specific working groups) included decentralization,&#13;
population, gender concerns, alternative energy, and bush fires.&#13;
4.    Overall, the Roundtable highlighted the need to focus on institutional and capacity development&#13;
as critical constraints to tackling specific problems of environmental degradation. The implementation&#13;
of the ESP will require significant efforts to ensure that all stakeholders participate, that capacity building&#13;
takes place at all levels, that there is strong demand for a coordination function within Government and&#13;
among NGOs, and that environmental education and awareness underpin the entire process.&#13;

MALAWI - ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICRO-PROJECTS&#13;
Concept&#13;
1.    The objective of the component is to develop the ability of communities to improve&#13;
environmental aspects of their lives, including manage the natural resources which they control and&#13;
depend on for a livelihood. It is founded in the belief that many communities in Malawi do have the&#13;
capacity to manage and execute their own development projects, but often lack the impetus and initial&#13;
capital to get started.&#13;
2.    This component will help promote the mobilization of communities to improve environmental&#13;
management in rural and urban areas. The component would be facilitated largely by NGOs with the&#13;
active involvement of line departments in Govemment. Activities under the component would be&#13;
initiated by systematic client consultations and "transformation training" provided by the NGO electing to&#13;
work with or chosen by the community. Follow up activities could be financed from "micro-projects"&#13;
funds, managed by MOREA, to support environment enhancing activities for the community.&#13;
3.    In environmental management, communities, while indirectly benefiting from the externalities of&#13;
improved resource management, may not perceive environmental degradation to be more important than&#13;
for example, schools or health clinics. Environmental problems thus have to be pro-actively targeted at&#13;
the community level. The community micro-projects would be designed, implemented and monitored by&#13;
the communities supported, if they so choose, by NGOs, the private sector or extension workers. Funds&#13;
would be administered by the Accounting Unit in MOREA, with the final review and approval decisions&#13;
to be taken by the Community Mobilization and Micro-projects Steering Committee.&#13;
4.    Theftrst stage of the process would be the capacity building, during which the community will&#13;
identify its needs and priorities through a participatory appraisal process, and formulate a community&#13;
environmental action plan. The plan will identify microprojects to be submitted to the Steering&#13;
Committee for approval. The plan would also identify the committee or group within the community&#13;
charged with carrying out the action plan, including the associated microprojects. The second stage&#13;
would be to finance implementation of those elements of the environment action plan approved by the&#13;
Steering Committee. This implementation phase would be led by the village committee identified for this&#13;
purpose, and could be supported by an NGO designated by the village. This could be the same NGO&#13;
which assisted in community mobilization.&#13;
5.    It must be recognized that although many of the concepts have been tested on a small scale in&#13;
earlier trials, this component is essentially an extended pilot operation. The concepts and structures&#13;
outlined below will be the subject of continuous monitoring during implementation and will be adjusted&#13;
as necessary following annual implementation reviews, and on the basis of regular consultation with the&#13;
communities, participating NGOs and Government line departments. Particular emphasis will be placed&#13;
on maintaining the community as the central focus of the program, and facilitating communities to&#13;
identify their own needs and challenges for environmental management, rather than prescribing certain&#13;
actions or activities for them. Monitoring will also aim to ensure that the administrative burden does not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
become too great to enable this to be replicated on a larger scale, and to ensure that there is convergence&#13;
of approach among different schemes.&#13;
Structure and Governance&#13;
Steering Committee&#13;
6.    The Community Mobilization and Environmental Microprojects activity would have a Steering&#13;
Committee consisting of representatives of the Government (MOREA, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of&#13;
Natural Resources, Ministry of Economic Planning and Development), the NGO community, and the&#13;
private sector. The Steering Committee would review proposals on the basis of the criteria specified&#13;
below, its consistency with regional and sectoral priorities, and MOREA policy and guidelines. Where&#13;
necessary additional inputs would be sought from participating NGOs and communities.&#13;
Coordinating Body&#13;
7.    MOREA would provide the leadership in the implementation of this component, through a&#13;
special team constituted within the Outreach Unit of the Environmental Affairs Department. This team&#13;
would include a contracted Coordinator of Community Mobilization and Environmental Microprojects&#13;
(CMEM), supporting staff, a vehicle and office equipment. While the team is expected to provide&#13;
leadership in carrying out this component, actual implementation would be contracted out as follows:&#13;
*  entering into contractual agreements as required with an agency for the training of NGOs in&#13;
community mobilization (including Participatory Rural Assessment techniques);&#13;
*  entering into contractual agreements with NGOs for carrying out (i) community mobilization&#13;
activities; (ii) preparation of community environment action plans; and (iii) monitoring the&#13;
implementation of such action plans.&#13;
In addition, the CMEM Team in MOREA, under the guidance of the Steering Committee and other&#13;
parties, would be responsible for:&#13;
* registering the NGOs who would participate in the program;&#13;
* defining the areas to be targeted under the program;&#13;
* receiving and providing initial review and feed back (as needed) on commtnity mobilization&#13;
proposals, ensuring that each proposal met the required criteria, and would be carried out&#13;
according to standardized procedures;&#13;
* presenting the various proposals from the eligible communities and NGOs to the Steering&#13;
Committee for approval;&#13;
* collecting the reports and monitoring the NGOs as the community mobilization activities are&#13;
completed;&#13;
*  overseeing the administrative and financial requirements of the program; and&#13;
* commissioning periodic evaluations of the program by outside agencies.&#13;
Funding Mechanisms:&#13;
8.    The funds for this activity will be managed by MOREA. Activities would be carried out on a&#13;
contractual basis. One agreement, between MOREA and the training agency, will set out the procedures&#13;
for training NGOs in participatory rural assessment and preparation of community environment action&#13;
plans. A second set of agreements, between MOREA and each of the participating NGOs, would set out&#13;
the responsibility of the participating NGOs in mobilizing communities and in monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the community environment action plans once approved. A third set of agreements&#13;
-2 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
would be established between MOREA and the community and would specify the nature of the grant to&#13;
be provided to the community for the implementation of the approved micro-project, and would set out&#13;
the responsibilities of the various parties in ensuring this grant is correctly used. Funds for financing&#13;
community micro-projects would be paid (in cash or kind) directly to the community as a grant, upon&#13;
authorization by the Steering Committee. MOREA will establish and maintain an accounting system for&#13;
the implementation of this component, through its central accounting system (to be reinforced with an&#13;
accounts clerk who would focus exclusively on this task).&#13;
Capacity Buildingfor Communities&#13;
Implementing NGOs:&#13;
9.    Capacity building of the communities in environmental awareness (including natural resource&#13;
management) would be carried out by NGOs, in collaboration with the relevant line ministries (i.e.&#13;
Departments of Forestry, and Parks and Wildlife). After an initial publicity campaign, interested NGOs&#13;
could apply to MOREA's Environmental Microprojects Team to determine eligibility to be in the&#13;
program (see criteria below). Eligibility would be determined based on:&#13;
*  track record in community based activities;&#13;
*  experience, interest or commitment to natural resource management activities at the community&#13;
level;&#13;
*  administrative capacity (ability to carry out agreed tasks, manage funds and report on them&#13;
responsibly and accurately);&#13;
*  ongoing activities with communities in the geographic area of relevance to the ESP.&#13;
10.   The agreements for community mobilization would be standardized, and would be prepared on&#13;
the basis of negotiations between MOREA and representatives of the NGO community. Initial features&#13;
of such agreements have been developed in the course of project preparation, and were field tested in the&#13;
Pilot phase of this component. A key principle would be to reimburse the NGO for direct costs incurred&#13;
in carrying out the activity. Under the first (mobilization) phase of the agreement, the NGOs would carry&#13;
out a participatory rural assessment, and work with the community towards the formulation of a&#13;
community environmental action plan. This phase would conclude with the presentation of the action&#13;
plan by the community to MOREA.&#13;
11.   In view of the desire to keep MOREA at arms length from actual implementation activities, and&#13;
in light of MOREA's limited capacity to carry out community based activities, the responsibility for&#13;
monitoring implementation of approved community action plans at the village level would also be&#13;
contracted out to the NGOs involved in community mobilization. Under this second phase of the&#13;
contract, the NGO would monitor the community's efforts to use funds provided by MOREA to&#13;
implement the action plan, and assist where necessary to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Following&#13;
completion of village activities under the community environment action plan, the supervising NGO&#13;
would prepare a brief report on the activities completed.&#13;
Eligible Communities&#13;
12.   Criteria for communities to receive "mobilization" training and capacity building could include:&#13;
* they are located in one of the priority areas for environmental intervention defined by MOREA&#13;
under the ESP;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* communities to be "mobilized" should have shown some interest in, and commitment to,&#13;
improving management of their natural resources;&#13;
13.   Interested communities would participate in the program through participating NGOs, DDCs and&#13;
other channels and request to be included in the CMEM program.&#13;
Community Based Environmental Micro-projects&#13;
14.   The second stage following community mobilization activities, and the formulation of the&#13;
environmental action plan, would be the financing of "micro-projects", i.e. activities or investments in the&#13;
community environmental action plan, which are related to improved environmental and natural resource&#13;
management. Communities could receive support and encouragement from the NGO which provided the&#13;
initial training. Technical assistance (from NGOs, line Ministries, or other sources) would be identified,&#13;
to assist the community in achieving its targets. Funds would be provided to the community on a grant&#13;
basis. Eligibility criteria could include the following to ensure that proposals:&#13;
*  are a relevant piece of a coherent environmental management plan prepared by the community&#13;
committee charged with environmental and natural resource management responsibilities;&#13;
*  include commitment by the community to behavior change and some kind of material&#13;
contribution in labor or materials (at least 10 percent of the total value of the proposed micro-&#13;
project);&#13;
*  include financial provision for outside "technical assistance" where necessary to ensure&#13;
successful implementation of proposed project. This assistance could be contracted from a local&#13;
NGO, or other source to be defined by community;&#13;
*  do not include items which could be funded under MASAF (i.e. heavy infrastructure such as&#13;
boreholes, water supply systems, school buildings, and health posts);&#13;
*  are graduated and iterative. The community will have to build credibility that it can indeed use&#13;
the resources effectively. In this sense, the first community "project" would be relatively small,&#13;
with an initial financial contribution of a maximum of, say, US$1,500-$3,000 for rural micro-&#13;
projects. On successful completion of this, the community would be eligible to apply for a&#13;
second or third project. These amounts are indicative and will be reviewed during the course of&#13;
implementing the program. A ceiling of US$5,000 is indicated for the set of microprojects to be&#13;
implemented under any given community environmental action plan in rural areas. A ceiling of&#13;
US$20,000 has been set for microprojects in an environmental action plan in urban areas;&#13;
*  include indicators of success, suggested by the community, for the micro-project to measure&#13;
progress during implementation. The community would also undertake to provide information&#13;
on the impact of the project (say on reforestation of areas, or reduction of soil loss, improved&#13;
waste management).&#13;
15.   The collaborating NGO would continue to work with the community, if requested, in&#13;
coordinating and supervising microproject implementation, under contract to MOREA. Communities&#13;
could, through the use of microproject funds, engage an NGO or other entity to provide more costly&#13;
technical support (say in the design of civil works) needed to implement the action plan. With the&#13;
experience gained, the community will then be empowered to seek finance for further projects from other&#13;
funding sources, such as MASAF and the EU Community Development Fund.&#13;
16.   The microproject proposals would be worked out by the community along with the NGO which&#13;
provided them with mobilization training. Once the environmental action plan was satisfactory, it would&#13;
be submitted to MOREA and the Steering Committee for review and approval. MOREA would maintain&#13;
a registry of projects and would contract an assessment of their execution, as warranted.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Line Ministry Activities&#13;
17.   Within the context of the ESP, the line departments, including of Forestry, and Parks and&#13;
Wildlife, will be planning and implementing co-management activities which involve community&#13;
mobilization. The departments concerned have only limited capacity for doing the capacity building&#13;
work in communities and would therefore rely largely on NGOs and other organizations to carry this out.&#13;
In particular, the Wildlife Department is likely to use NGOs in working with the communities&#13;
surrounding the Protected Areas to develop co-management arrangements. This could be done either&#13;
through direct contract, and financed out of the Departmental allocations for the co-management&#13;
activities, or otherwise through the community mobilization component. This will allow the Departments&#13;
to ensure that the activities are carried out in the priority areas that they have selected (e.g., forest reserve&#13;
areas). Subsequently, the communities may wish to implement activities using the microproject funds. In&#13;
this case they would apply for the funds in accordance with the same criteria as those established for&#13;
NGO initiated activities. Training should also be provided for staff in line Departments in capacity&#13;
building for communities.&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
MALAWI - ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT PROGRAM&#13;
MIDDLE SHIRE LAND DEGRADATION&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.    The purpose of this annex is to review the currently available information on land degradation of&#13;
the Middle Shire catchments and siltation of the Shire River. Some indication of the economic&#13;
significance of the siltation is given. The efficiency of countermeasures are discussed, and ongoing&#13;
efforts by the World Bank and/or other donors in collaboration with domestic institutions are discussed.&#13;
Land Degradation and Rehabilitation&#13;
2.    Land degradation takes on many forms, but the one in focus in Malawi is soil erosion. This has&#13;
been identified as the main environmental problem in the National Environmental Action Plan. While&#13;
the cost estimates of environmental damage due to erosion provided in the NEAP can be questioned,&#13;
there is no doubt that there is considerable scope for investment in low-cost, manual conservation&#13;
techniques. This annex only deals with the siltation in the Middle Shire River Catchment.&#13;
Benefits and Costs of Middle Shire River Catchment Management&#13;
3.    The Shire River is of vital economic importance to Malawi as it:&#13;
* contains almost all of the country's power generating capacity&#13;
* supplies water to major urban centers such as Blantyre and Limbe&#13;
* supports a locally significant artisanal fishery&#13;
* supplies irrigation schemes for valuable crops.&#13;
4.    The problem in the Middle Shire River Catchment is one of long-standing siltation in&#13;
combination of low water level in Lake Malawi. As a result, the Shire River actually stopped flowing&#13;
from 1915 to 1937. While this gives some perspective to the current reported problems, it should be&#13;
recogized that new installations of hydropower and water supply makes the economic damage of&#13;
interrupted or diminished water flows greater than ever.&#13;
5.    In late 1995, the Lake reached its lowest level since 1954, and the flow dropped to about 129&#13;
cumecs, compared to a required base flow of 170 cumecs. It has been estimated that a further fall in the&#13;
lake level of only one more cm would have caused the flow to cease entirely, as the lowest lake bar at&#13;
Samama (the outlet of the lake into the Shire) has been rising to clog the water channel. This build-up of&#13;
sediment at entry is related to the siltation in the Upper Channel from Mangoche to Liwonde. In view of&#13;
this, an emergency project including pumping of up to 70 cumecs from the Lake and into the Upper&#13;
Channel (which will reduce lake level with about 7.5 mm), dredging at Nkula Falls and combined with&#13;
long-tern catchment conservation, is under way.&#13;
6.    Sizing the magnitude of the problem, a recent study2 has estimated that gross field erosion in the&#13;
7,350 km2 Middle Shire River study area is in the order of 25 million tons per annum. On the basis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
subjective but explicitly specified sediment delivery ratios for each of the ten catchments, the net&#13;
sediment delivery into the Shire River is estimated to about 3.3 million tons per annum.&#13;
7.    The urgency of catchment protection should not be driven by the magnitude of sunk costs--which&#13;
have been referred to in the debate about protective measures. Rather, the future potential losses of&#13;
economic values at stake should be considered.&#13;
8.    First, consider the value of hydropower. The total hydropower sales in 1 995 (as projected in&#13;
1992) amount to about GWh 844, while the projected tariff was USc6.64/Kwh.3 T'his implies a total&#13;
projected (full collection) revenue of about $56 million. Adding a provision for some consumer surplus,&#13;
say up to USc1O/kWh we arrive at about $84 million in annual gross value of hydiropower production.&#13;
Most of the costs of hydropower are fixed, making the net loss of power interruptions approach the gross&#13;
value. In fact the cost of unforeseen power outages would be even higher per Kwh than indicated above.&#13;
9.     Second, consider urban water supply. Data on gross sales of water are culTently not available,&#13;
but there is some information about the defensive expenditures that are incurred as a result of siltation for&#13;
the major water urban water user; Blantyre (pop. 0.5 million). The costs fall into four categories:4&#13;
*   Installation of dredging machinery used in emergency clearing of the water intake&#13;
(installation cost about $30,000)&#13;
-   Installation and running of a pontoon dredging system that evacuates sediment into&#13;
downstream water 0.5 km below intake (installation about $50,000 plus running costs about&#13;
$7,000 per year, mostly for fuel).&#13;
*   Adding of polymers, a liquid coagulant used to decrease water turbidiity (about $330,000 per&#13;
year);&#13;
-   The potential construction of a sediment barrier with a scraping mechanism. While this is&#13;
still under study, a guesstimate is that it would cost in the order of $30,000-$70,000 to&#13;
construct.&#13;
Hence the major defensive expenditures are not sunk costs.&#13;
10.   Third, fisheries are affected by both the level of water flow and the level of turbidity in the&#13;
water. In the worst case scenario, flow would be entirely clogged, and marshes would gradually dry out.&#13;
The latest available data5 shows that the catch of fish in Lower and Middle Shire amounted to about&#13;
3,000 tons in 1992 and 1993. This was a significant decline from the peak year of 1989, with about&#13;
12,000 tons of catch. Applying the national average unit price, the value of 3,000 tons in 1993 was about&#13;
MK5.55 million. Using the exchange rate for 1993 (World Bank, 1993), this equals $1.4 million. While&#13;
this is a gross value, the major input cost is labor, and shadow price of this factor of production must be&#13;
considered low.6 Hence, the net values at stake are not considerably lower than that. In terms of&#13;
employment, the statistics only show results for the Lower Shire. This indicates a population of&#13;
fishermen and assistants (i.e. fishermen that do not own their boats) of about 2,000 in 1994-5.&#13;
11.   Given this list of actual and potentially significant costs of increasing sedimentation, one must&#13;
explore possible solutions. Green et al (1996:8) states that a reduction of erosion will depend mainly on&#13;
the introduction of conservation farming on the 4,900 km2 of land that is under cultivation in the study&#13;
area, but that "The slow improvement likely to result from the measures involved would have little or no&#13;
effect on sedimentation in the short, or probably even in the medium-term.". The report, however, goes&#13;
on to make the case for selective conservation interventions, based on-site damage considerations, i.e. the&#13;
soil loss impact on farm productivity.&#13;
-2 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.   Technically, there are ways and means to drastically reduce the soil loss from cultivated land.&#13;
Amphlett (1986)7 studied soil loss and a set of other parameters in four catchments with comparable size,&#13;
slope, altitude and soil type, during 3-4 years. The results show a drastic average reduction in soil loss&#13;
from almost 11 t/halyear for the "traditional cultivation" catchment, via 3 tlha for the "physical&#13;
conservation" treatment, to about 0.1 t/ha for the "full land use plan" catchment. While reservations&#13;
about the accuracy of these measurements have been pronounced by a source close to the study, the&#13;
sediment yield could be reduced substantially with a simple package of soil conservation measures.&#13;
13.   The crucial issue is: how much this would cost? The absence of "model" conservation&#13;
catchments outside Agricultural Research Stations indicate that financial rationality is insufficient to&#13;
drive such measures. The poor economic performance of large-scale mechanized conservation works in&#13;
Malawi has been documented by Mwakalagho (1 985) . Later projects, however, have developed&#13;
manually based low-cost techniques. Even so, the overhead costs tend to be high, and it is vital to&#13;
integrate other farm improvements to raise productivity with conservation.&#13;
14.   Detailed cost estimates developed for the proposed "Promotion of Soil Conservation and Rural&#13;
Production Project" (GFA, 1996) 9, which benefit from the implementation of a pilot project, show a total&#13;
cost of about $23 million for the agricultural component. The project document assume that some&#13;
100,000 to 200,000 farmers will have joined the project at its closure.10 Assuming an average farm size&#13;
of 1 ha per household, this implies a unit cost of $115-230/ha, including donor contributions,&#13;
Government of Malawi counterpart funds, and local labor. It should be emphasized that the project will&#13;
not only promote soil and water conservation measures (expected to contribute directly to only some&#13;
20% of the project's benefits) but also a package of yield improving measures including new varieties of&#13;
maize, legumes and agroforestry techniques.&#13;
15.   Using these figures for the Middle Shire River catchment, a rough calculation could illustrate the&#13;
magnitude of the problem. If all the 490,000 ha of cultivated land in the Middle Shire River were to be&#13;
treated at a unit cost of $150, the total cost would be staggering ($73.5 million). Targeting only one third&#13;
of the most erosion-affected areas of the cultivated land above Nkula would then amount to some $21&#13;
million in investment cost.&#13;
16.   The exact impact of this type of targeted intervention cannot be foreseen with any precision, but&#13;
a numerical example can serve to illustrate the magnitudes involved. Assuming that this type of&#13;
conservation would reduce the sediment yield with a 75% efficiency on treated land, i.e., areas with very&#13;
severe and severe erosion above Nkula, the order of magnitude in overall reduction could be about&#13;
1 million tons of sediment per year. The annualized cost of the investment of $21 million (at 10% over&#13;
20 years) is about $2.5 million. Ignoring the time profile of the project, the unit cost would therefore be&#13;
about $2-3 per ton of sediment retained.&#13;
17.   The cost of sediment retention through soil conservation can be compared with the cost of&#13;
dredging. For the Nkula pondage, this has been estimated to $3-6 per m3, much depending on the&#13;
dumping site. l Assuming the bulk density of surface soil is about 1.4 g/cm3, this corresponds to a&#13;
dredging cost of about $2-4 per ton.&#13;
18.   Far from all sediment that is released into the Shire River is trapped in structures below,&#13;
however. There is very little information on the "trap efficiency" of dam structures, but Green et al&#13;
(1996:7) report that the Nkula Falls reservoir may have lost half of its 3 million m3 storage over the last&#13;
15 years, which implies an annual rate of about 140,000 tons. This is only about 7 percent of the total&#13;
sediment delivery estimated to enter the River above Nkula Falls.12 Using this assumption, the cost for&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
preventing one ton of sediment to be trapped in Nkula pondage through watershed conservation would be&#13;
$29-43 ($2-3/0.07). With such a low trap efficiency, it appears more cost-effective from an off-site&#13;
damage perspective, to dredge the sediment that settle into the dam, rather than invest in soil&#13;
conservation measures.&#13;
19.   The point remains, however, that there could be localized areas that (a) are above the pondage&#13;
that (b) yield considerable sediment per hectare due to steep slopes and local and highly erodible soils,&#13;
and (c) have a high sediment delivery ratio into the river due to proximity to the River and local drainage&#13;
conditions, where the off-site benefits of conservation would make a significant contribution to the&#13;
economic rationale to conservation.&#13;
20.   Translating this off-site externality into a financial rationality for the farmers would require a&#13;
transfer mechanism. This can only be established in an institutional environment where a holistic view&#13;
of the catchment is taken. The downstream beneficiaries could then pay for the service of upstream&#13;
catchment protection. This would not be a "subsidy" but an integral part of payment for ensured water&#13;
and power supply.&#13;
21.    So far, the discussion has taken an off-site damage perspective on soil erosion. Obviously, there&#13;
would be some on-site benefits to soil conservation measures. How significant could they be? The&#13;
answer depends very much on (a) assumed initial levels of productivity and (b) the soil loss yield decline&#13;
function applied.&#13;
22.   The initial yield level can be illustrated with data adapted from the Agricultural Support&#13;
13&#13;
Programs farm models&#13;

23.   Assuming that the most common type of cultivation in the area is local maize, as in the rest of&#13;
the country, the base line gross margin is only about $55 per hectare. If it is assumed that all input costs&#13;
are taken ex-ante, that is that there is no saving in costs due to lower yield (which is not literally true),&#13;
the losses in gross margin can serve as a measure of net economic losses.&#13;
24.   As intervention would be selective in the larger catchments, we need to relate the prevented&#13;
losses to explicit baseline conditions of erosion. Targeting an area of about one quarter of the land&#13;
would cover the areas most affected, as shown in the table below.&#13;

values of a yield loss of 3% per centimeter, implies an annual yield loss of about 1-2% per year. This&#13;
equals a dollar or less per annum in gross margin loss per hectare. Even allowing for the accumulated&#13;
impact of consecutive years of erosion, this is not enough to justify anything but very low cost&#13;
investment in soil conservation. This may be a reason why so little spontaneous conservation activity&#13;
can be observed.&#13;
Ongoing Soil Conservation Projects&#13;
26.   It should be added that there are already considerable efforts underway to combat land&#13;
degradation, sponsored mainly by the EU, UNDP/FAO and IFAD, as well as many NGOs. With regard&#13;
to the World Bank's involvement, there are two projects of particular relevance.&#13;
27.   First, the comprehensive Agricultural Services Project (ASP)14 identifies "land resources and&#13;
conservation" as one of its five main areas of activity in its extension component. In the financing plan a&#13;
total of about US$1.8 million (2.8% of total costs) is specified under the conservation component. ADB&#13;
is listed as contributing almost all of this, while GOM contributes the rest. Hence, there is no direct IDA&#13;
contribution, but the project harbors undisbursed resources which could contribute to conservation&#13;
activities in priority areas.&#13;
28.   ASP aims to train all extension staff in the country in low cost soil and water conservation&#13;
practices so that it becomes a mainstream activity in all Extension Planning Areas (EPAs). This process&#13;
is not organized by watershed, and will be disseminated to any individual or group that is interested.&#13;
Hence, targeting specific catchments in the Middle Shire River would require an additional and separate&#13;
effort, but would be possible to achieve within the framework of the program.&#13;
29.   Second the recently effective National Water Development Project'5 which specifies soil&#13;
conservation measures in selected catchments: Lunyangwa River, Chifuga/Chitete Rivers,&#13;
Mpamadzi/Mariku Rivers, Mwanza River and Mzimba River. (The second to last is a tributary to the&#13;
Shire River). The measures will include restricting cultivation on steep river banks and other unsuitable&#13;
locations, revegetation and farmer education in 15 catchment basins for these measures. The costs are&#13;
specified as a total of US$1.6 million, of which 1.0 million constitute the local contribution. The total&#13;
comprise only 2% of the project cost of US$130 million.&#13;
30.   The principle for selecting target catchments is that they are directly delivering water to an&#13;
intake for an urbanized area. A list of 56 rural catchments and a few urban ones has been established for&#13;
-5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the project. Only some of them are in the Middle Shire River, and the exact extent of intervention in&#13;
each one has not been defined. The extension message will be developed in collaboration with MOALD,&#13;
FD and MOREA. A special Task Force involving them will be formed, but so far contacts have been&#13;
limited to discussions held during the time of project design.&#13;
31.    The conclusions to be drawn from this review are that:&#13;
*   significant economic values are at stake in preserving an uninterrupted and less sediment-&#13;
laden flow in the Shire River;&#13;
*   based on off-site impacts only, the scope for cost-effective soil conselvation measures,&#13;
which could complement dredging to ensure sufficient water supply, iis very limited;&#13;
*   translating the economic rationale for control of off-site damage due to soil erosion into a&#13;
financial incentive for farmers would require an institutional entity capable of managing&#13;
payments from downstream users to upstream managers;&#13;
*   there are already significant activities on-going to address land degradation that utilize&#13;
existing domestic capacity to a high degree, and some of these could target selected areas in&#13;
the Shire River;&#13;
* the World Bank has two projects that can be used to apply limited resources to this problem;&#13;
*   further targeted interventions could also be sponsored by the financial mechanism for&#13;
community-driven projects included in the ESP;&#13;
*   the analysis to date demonstrates the need for a much improved system for gathering and&#13;
analyzing environmental information as a basis for policy and strategic decision-making.&#13;

            Malawi - Environmental Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Environmental
            Management Project are to: (1) strengthen the capacity of
            the Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs (MOREA)
            and the environmental network in Malawi, and improve
            capabilities in regulation, information management,
            promotion and coordination; (2) implement a broad-based
            program of environmental education; (3) shift the
            responsibility for sustainable resource management, and the
            reversal of degradation, to the community level; and (4)
            support initiatives in key areas of degradation. There are
            four components: (1) Institutional strengthening of the
            environment information system, including support for
            training and operations, to enable MOREA to carry out its
            policy, monitoring, and control functions; and training of
            line departments, regional and district administrations, and
            nongovernmental organizations; (2) Environmental education
            to: (a) increase public awareness and participation; (b)
            integrate environmental education into the educational
            system; (c) improve the quality of environmental information
            and access; and (d) identify formal and non-formal systems
            for information dissemination; (3) Developing the capability
            of communities to manage natural resources through: (a)
            NGO-managed activities, including mobilizing communities and
            running micro-projects to finance small-scale activities;
            and (b) Department managed activities, including entering
            into agreements to co-manage publicly-managed resources with
            communities;  and (4) Environmental actions and studies on
            climate change and long lead forecasting, water hyacinth
            control, bilharzia control, national park management; and
            policy planning support.
