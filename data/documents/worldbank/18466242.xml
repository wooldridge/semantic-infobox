the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery - GFDRR (TF 070948) (the "GFDRR&#13;

Agreement. Other donors are also expected to contribute to the Trust Fund on the terms and&#13;
conditions specified in the Annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
2.    The Contribution will be used to finance the activities and the categories of expenditure&#13;
set forth in the "Description of Activities and Expenditures under the GFDRR Track 3 Technical&#13;
Assistance MDTF" attached hereto as Annex 1, and will be administered by the Bank on behalf&#13;

3.    The Donor shall deposit the Contribution into such bank account designated by the Bank&#13;
in installments in accordance with the following schedule:&#13;
(a) promptly following countersignature of this Agreement by the Donor and submission&#13;
of a payment request by the Bank, five million Danish Kroner (DKK 5,000,000); and&#13;

payment details information (remittance advice) field of its SWIFT payment message,&#13;
