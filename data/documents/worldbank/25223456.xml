                                           Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA&#13;
&#13;
1.      Bangladesh lies along the Ganges-Brahmaputra Deltaâ&#128;&#148;Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest and the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s most densely populated delta. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s 160 million inhabitants live on a land mass&#13;
of nearly 150,000 km2, resulting in a population density of about 1,600 per km2. The delta not only&#13;
marks the countryâ&#128;&#153;s physiology, but also the culture and livelihoods of its people. Like all delta&#13;
environments, Bangladesh is a hotspot for natural disasters and climate change. Today, most&#13;
Bangladeshis live in rural areas, but new employment opportunities in the industrial and service&#13;
sectors have fueled urban population in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Bangladesh has proven to be remarkably resilient despite its challenging&#13;
circumstances and achieved significant human development gains over the last four decades.&#13;
Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s impressive progress on health outcomes, population growth, access and equity to&#13;
education, and gender equality is well documented. In 1971, Bangladesh ranked well below India&#13;
in many social indicators, but today, with less than 60 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s income per capita, it ranks&#13;
higher in most such indicators, as well as above many other low- and lower-middle-income&#13;
countries with similar or better initial conditions in 1971 (see Table 1).&#13;

income groups comprise countries with per-capita GNI &lt;US$1,045 and US$1,046-US$4,125 respectively in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Rapid growth enabled Bangladesh to cross the threshold to lower middle income&#13;
country (LMIC) status of per capita GNI of $1,046 in FY14. Per capita income increased&#13;
further in FY15 to US$1,220. GDP grew well above the average for developing countries in recent&#13;
years, averaging 6.2 percent since 2010. While Bangladesh has achieved its ambition to reach&#13;
middle-income-status by 2021 ahead of time, the challenge will be to further accelerate growth so&#13;
that it moves well past the threshold and further up the income range of LMICs.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Several factors are behind the resilience of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s economy, against the&#13;
backdrop of a volatile global economy. Robust macroeconomic fundamentals at the onset of the&#13;
financial crisis, strong growth of exports and remittances, and relatively insulated financial&#13;
markets have played an important role. Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s exports doubled their world market share&#13;
between 1995 and 2012. The RMG sector has been a key contributor, with its share of total exports&#13;
accounting for more than 80 percent in FY14. Bangladesh is now the worldâ&#128;&#153;s second largest&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Bangladesh CPF Consultations, Oct â&#128;&#147; Nov 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
garment exporter, making it unique among low-income countries because of the high share of&#13;
manufactured goods in its exports.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Growth in the near and medium-term is expected to rise modestly. If stability prevails,&#13;
Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s strong domestic demand, gradually improving investment climate, and moderate&#13;
single digit inflation are expected to raise GDP growth to 6.7 percent in FY17 and 6.8 percent in&#13;
FY18. Political instability and declining export competitiveness in European markets constitute&#13;
the main risks in the medium-term. Especially the resurgence of prolonged and intense political&#13;
instability would hamper private sector activities and threaten macroeconomic stability.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Bangladesh has made good progress to achieve the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s twin goals of eliminating&#13;
extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity. The country is on track to achieve&#13;
the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the incidence of extreme poverty by 2015.&#13;
Projections using 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data (the latest&#13;
available) indicate that the national poverty rate fell to 24.8 percent in 2015, less than half the 58.8&#13;
percent rate in 1991-92. Based on the US$1.25 global poverty measure, the number of the poor&#13;
fell by 12 million, from around 77 million to 65 million, at a rate that was 60 percent faster than&#13;
in the rest of the developing world, excluding China. In addition, Bangladesh is also amongst a&#13;
select group of countries worldwide that experienced a decline in inequality. Between 2000 and&#13;
2010, inequality in rural areas, where about 70 percent of the population continues to reside,&#13;
remained more or less unchanged, while inequality in urban areas trended downwards. With a Gini&#13;
index of about 0.3 at the national level, inequality is lower than in Nepal, India, Sri Lanka,&#13;
Indonesia, and most East Asian countries.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Increases in labor incomes have been a main driver of poverty reduction and&#13;
declining inequality. The structural shift from agriculture to industry and services has accelerated&#13;
in recent years and created new and better paid jobs. In the non-agricultural sector, net employment&#13;
rose by more than 10 million between 2002-03 and 2013, outstripping the 3.3 million increase in&#13;
agriculture. Labor productivity increased dramatically across the board: the growth in output per&#13;
worker was especially large in the industrial and agricultural sectors, while services also&#13;
experienced a significant increase. Notwithstanding the fall in agricultureâ&#128;&#153;s share in total&#13;
employment, increases in farm incomes accounted for more than 90 percent of the poverty&#13;
reduction between 2005 and 2010.&#13;
&#13;
8.     Despite Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s remarkable development achievements, significant challenges&#13;
remain in its quest to eliminate extreme poverty. Bangladesh continues to be one of the poorest&#13;
countries in the region, with constrained public services and comparatively weak institutions. Even&#13;
though it has done fairly well in recent years, many others, e.g. China, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam,&#13;
have done much better (see Table 2).&#13;

&#13;
9.      Earlier this year the WBG conducted a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) which&#13;
highlights the creation of more and better jobs as the key challenge for eliminating poverty&#13;
and boosting shared prosperity in Bangladesh. Jobs remain a critical concern in the country:&#13;
the labor force is growing by 3.1 percent per annumâ&#128;&#148;1.3 times the South Asian and 1.7 times the&#13;
global averageâ&#128;&#148;and 21 million people are projected to enter the working age population over the&#13;
next decade. Many young Bangladeshis remain trapped in low-wage, labor intensive, and insecure&#13;
informal work. Accelerating the employment shift of casual workers and small farmers engaged&#13;
in agriculture to salaried employment in more dynamic and remunerative sectors of the economy&#13;
is an important priority. At the same time, growth and employment opportunities associated with&#13;
diversification of agriculture and value addition in the agricultural supply chains must be captured.&#13;
&#13;
10.     One major impediment to higher growth rates, private sector development and job&#13;
creation is the low level of investment in infrastructure. Bangladesh devotes a smaller&#13;
percentage of GDP to investments than other countries in South Asia. Public investment in hard&#13;
infrastructure stands at less than 2 percent of GDP, resulting in lower infrastructure quality. China,&#13;
Thailand, and Vietnam invest more than 7 percent of GDP. Unless Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks are addressed, they risk becoming increasingly important constraints for growth. WBG&#13;
estimates indicate that reaching sustained growth rates of 7.5-8.0 percent would require an increase&#13;
in infrastructure investments to around 10 percent of GDP per year.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The SCD identifies foundational and transformational priorities where concerted&#13;
efforts by the government and other stakeholders would yield the highest payoffs for&#13;
promoting sustainable growth and creating jobs. As described in Table 3 below, foundational&#13;
priorities are areas where Bangladesh has mostly done well in the past, but which continue to be&#13;
pre-requisites for faster job creation and growth and therefore require sustained policy attention.&#13;
Transformational priorities represent lagging areas, where concerted actions over the next three to&#13;
five years could have a profound impact on the pace of progress towards eliminating poverty and&#13;
boosting shared prosperity.&#13;

                                                                                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Bangladesh CPF Consultations, Oct â&#128;&#147; Nov 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      Table 3: Summary of Key Priorities for Action Identified by the SCD&#13;
&#13;
    PRIORITY AREAS WITH POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON TWIN GOALS&#13;
    Energy sector: key priorities include increasing the supply of electricity and natural gas, diversifying sources of&#13;
    power supply, retiring polluting and expensive emergency diesel generators, eliminating energy subsidies (and the&#13;
    resulting significant fiscal burden), and eliminating distorted market signals.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Increased availability of electricity helps increase economic activities, which in turn&#13;
    generate jobs and income opportunities, thus reducing poverty.&#13;
    Inland connectivity and logistics: key priorities include upgrading and integrating key transport corridors (in&#13;
    particular the Dhaka-Chittagong highway), improving management of the port in Chittagong, reviving inland water&#13;
    transportation, and improving the maintenance of existing assets.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Improved connectivity will help reduce transport time and costs and boost productivity,&#13;
    which will help promote enterprise, generate jobs and increase incomes of workers.&#13;
    Regional and global integration: the key priorities are to tap considerable potential to capture a higher share of the&#13;
    manufacturing jobs moving out of higher-income countries by reviving the stalled trade reform agenda; moving up to&#13;
    higher value added manufacturing; and to make migration more remunerative, affordable, inclusive, and safe.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Increased export-led growth will help accelerate and diversify the source of GDP growth&#13;
    and create new jobs that will help improve incomes and living standards.&#13;
    Urbanization: key priorities are to improve urban competiveness and livability, especially for the poor (e.g.&#13;
    connectivity, efficient land use, public services and amenities) and to reduce environmental externalities (air and&#13;
    water pollution).&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Improving the livability and quality of urban amenities will make growth more&#13;
    environmentally and socially sustainable and ensure that the poor also benefit from urbanization&#13;
    Adaptive delta management: key priorities are to promote agricultural productivity and diversification; to enhance&#13;
    long-term planning for better land and water use and natural resource management; and to revitalize and strengthen&#13;
    key infrastructure to protect the population, reduce vulnerability, and secure growth.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: A holistic long-term approach to managing economic development of the delta will ensure&#13;
    that growth is sustainable, inclusive and reduces the vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters.&#13;
    FOUNDATIONAL PRIORITIES&#13;
    Macroeconomic stability and related cross-cutting challenges: Key priorities include achieving higher revenue&#13;
    mobilization through tax policy and tax administration reforms; better implementation of the Annual Development&#13;
    Program; and improved health of the financial sector and enhanced financial intermediation.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: A strong macroeconomic framework is essential to promote growth, financial sector stability&#13;
    and private sector competitiveness needed to create jobs and boost the incomes of the poor.&#13;
    Human development: Key next-generation priorities are related to reducing malnutrition, improving the quality of&#13;
    public service delivery (including workforce skills); increasing public funding for health and moving towards&#13;
    universal health coverage; and extending coverage of social protection to the urban poor.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Investing in skills and education will help generate jobs in the formal sector and foster&#13;
    income opportunities; access to quality healthcare and improved social protection coverage will reduce the&#13;
    vulnerability of the poor and enhance their ability to participate in the labor market.&#13;
    Institutions and business environment: Stronger institutions are needed to manage a larger and more complex&#13;
    economy, to meet the aspirations of a more diverse and heterogeneous population, and to ensure that the prevailing&#13;
    business environment is conducive to higher investment and growth.&#13;
    Impact on twin goals: Stronger institutions can help foster a business-friendly environment for growth, which in&#13;
    turn will increase economic opportunities to grow incomes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
II. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
12.     The creation of more and better jobs that contribute significantly to growth and&#13;
poverty reduction will require several complementary transitions to be achieved&#13;
simultaneously. First, given that the majority of the poor continue to live in rural areas and remain&#13;
largely dependent on subsistence agriculture, it will be important for agriculture to continue to&#13;
perform well, with improvements over time both in agricultural productivity and diversification,&#13;
as well as increased agri-business. Second, to enable higher value-addition in the economy as a&#13;
whole, Bangladesh needs to help people move out of agriculture and into manufacturingâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                             4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Bangladesh CPF Consultations, Oct â&#128;&#147; Nov 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
particularly manufacturing for exports. Third, Bangladeshi businesses will need to diversify both&#13;
their products and markets, building on a nascent competitive advantage in areas such as&#13;
pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding, leather goods, jute-based goods (including particularly footwear),&#13;
ICT (including business process outsourcing), and varieties of light engineering. To do so,&#13;
Bangladesh will first have to remove the binding constraints to growth posed by low access to&#13;
reliable and affordable power, poor transportation infrastructure, limited availability of serviced&#13;
land, rapid urbanization and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, among others.&#13;
In addition to these bottlenecks, some industries may also face specific constraints in taxation,&#13;
labor laws, access to finance, and sector-specific infrastructure, which the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh will need to help the business community address. There is also still room to grow&#13;
the RMG sector: although Bangladesh is already the second-largest exporter of ready-made&#13;
garments after China, it is still only about one-quarter of its size in China.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The proposed CPFâ&#128;&#152;s overarching goal is to create more and better jobs. This will&#13;
refocus the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s strategic directions on policy areas which could help remove stubborn&#13;
impediments to job creation and poverty reduction. The CPF is aligned with the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 7th&#13;
Five Year Plan and the proposed program is anchored in the five transformational priorities&#13;
identified in the SCD (see Table 1), with the clear objective of increasing engagement in these&#13;
areas to make a dent in poverty reduction. In particular, the Bank will shift more financing toward&#13;
energy and transportation infrastructureâ&#128;&#148;areas where progress has been limited, where the WBG&#13;
has a comparative advantage and where it must play an active role to remain relevant. The program&#13;
also takes into account the legacy portfolio and will continue to support the foundational priorities&#13;
through engagements which have already been initiated, specifically in health, education, social&#13;
protection, revenue mobilization, financial sector, and the business environmentâ&#128;&#148;areas where the&#13;
Bank enjoys a comparative advantage, or has played a leadership role in leveraging donor support.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s weak governance and institutions have undermined the sustainability&#13;
of reforms, and the CPF will support institutional capacity-building through activities&#13;
embedded in operations across the portfolio. This is a critical long-term agenda that needs to&#13;
be tackled on a sustained basis across multiple fronts. At the national level, the Bank will continue&#13;
ongoing efforts to improve public financial management, public procurement, civil service reform,&#13;
service delivery (through, for example, linking the use of personal IDs with service delivery),&#13;
access to information, and transparency in state-owned enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
15.     In defining the program for the outer years, the CPF will consider three selectivity&#13;
criteria: i) consistency with the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 7th Five Year Plan to ensure strong country&#13;
ownership; ii) alignment with policy priorities identified in the SCD; and iii) the WBG&#13;
comparative advantage, taking into account the knowledge and financing support provided by&#13;
other development partners. As in the past, this CPF will also maintain a degree of flexibility such&#13;
that the WBG can respond rapidly to changing country priorities, evolving country context or&#13;
unforeseen events such as natural disasters.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
CPF objectives and will contribute to the achievement of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s national goals as articulated&#13;
in the 7th Five Year Plan (see Results Framework below).&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Focus Area 1: Growth and Competitiveness: Bangladesh has sustained impressive growth&#13;
    rates over the last decade, fueled by a young population, jobs in manufacturing, increased&#13;
    agricultural productivity and remittances from overseas workers. But it will need to grow even&#13;
    faster in order to create enough jobs for the 2 million new workersâ&#128;&#148;male and femaleâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
    stepping into the labor force each year. Increasing investments and jobs in the private sector&#13;
    will require Bangladesh to undertake a broad set of reforms to further enhance competitiveness.&#13;
    Bangladesh also shares a 4,100 km border with India, making regional cooperation an&#13;
    imperative to attract investments and boost growth. To support these objectives, WBG&#13;
    activities will seek to remove barriers to growth such as increasing electricity supply,&#13;
    improving transport connectivity, expanding financial intermediation and creating an&#13;
    environment conducive to doing business, among others.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Focus Area 2: Social Inclusion: Bangladesh achieved remarkable progress in expanding&#13;
    health and education services to the poor, with special attention to girls, and in creating work&#13;
    opportunities for women, particularly in the RMG sector. Even so, pockets of poverty persist&#13;
    across the country, malnutrition afflicts children from both low and higher income households,&#13;
    and access to public services remains constrained. Most workers are trapped in informal&#13;
    employment, with little opportunity to upgrade their skills and find better jobs. The WBG&#13;
    activities under this area will aim to consolidate the equity and access gains in health and&#13;
    education, and address the next generation of challenges related to quality, higher education&#13;
    and skills development, with continued due regard to gender. In addition, the WBG will seek&#13;
    to expand coverage of social protection, access to clean water and sanitation, and bring the&#13;
    rural poor into the folds of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s progress with support to their livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Focus Area 3: Climate and Environment Management: With two-thirds of its landmass&#13;
    less than five meters above sea level, Bangladesh is highly susceptible to sea-level rise and&#13;
    storm-induced tidal flooding which climate change is raising to an existential threat. The future&#13;
    is likely to threaten food security and freshwater supplies (especially because of saline&#13;
    intrusion into shallow groundwater), and increase prevalent water-related diseases, and&#13;
    repeated damage to poorly-sited or poorly-constructed infrastructure. To manage the complex&#13;
    Bangladesh delta effectively, the Government is preparing an integrated and holistic long-term&#13;
    planâ&#128;&#148;the Delta Plan 2100â&#128;&#148;to promote safe living through greater resilience and sound&#13;
    economic development. The Plan is based on an adaptive delta management (ADM) approach,&#13;
    which ensures that all sectoral investments take into account the long term uncertainties related&#13;
    to climate change and growth. WBG support will be aligned with the ADM principle, with&#13;
    activities focused on boosting Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s resilience to natural disasters, improving the&#13;
    management of water and natural resources and modernizing agriculture by promoting&#13;
    productivity with climate-smart technology, diversification and accelerating the move up the&#13;
    value chain.&#13;

       The CPF objectives and indicators shown below are for discussion purposes and subject to change&#13;
&#13;
Focus Area 1: Growth and Competitiveness&#13;
Description: In order for Bangladesh to create enough jobs for the 2 million new workers stepping into the work force every&#13;
year the country will need to grow faster. This focus area concentrates on removing barriers to growth by supporting increasing&#13;
access to electricity supply, improving transport connectivity, strengthening service delivery in local government, strengthening&#13;
financial sector efficiency and streamlining business environment.&#13;
&#13;
Link with twin goals: SCD identifies that in addressing bottlenecks in key areas such as (i) increasing availability of energy&#13;
will increase economic opportunities in urban/rural areas; (ii) improving connectivity will help reduce transport time and cost&#13;
and boost productivity, which will help promote enterprise, generate jobs and increase incomes of workers; (iii) improving&#13;
livability of cities, strengthening business environment and enhancing financial intermediation can result in transformational&#13;
growth, create more and better jobs and lifting greater numbers out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Country development goals: The government plans to accelerate growth by prioritizing attention on infrastructure development.&#13;
The key elements will concentrate on ensuring efficient and cost effective supply of primary energy, strengthening the use of&#13;
river transport to provide a low cost alternative to road transport and coordinating the roads and strengthening the performance&#13;
of the port. The government goal also identifies several drivers of growth such as improving the investment climate, enhancing&#13;
the efficiency of the financial sector and improving urban governance through the provision of affordable basic infrastructures&#13;
and services.&#13;

            Bangladesh - Country partnership framework
            FY2016-2020 : executive summary
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Bangladesh lies along the
            Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, Asia’s largest and the world’s
            most densely populated delta. The country’s 160 million
            inhabitants live on a land mass of nearly 150,000 km,
            resulting in a population density of about 1,600 per km. The
            delta not only marks the country’s physiology, but also the
            culture and livelihoods of its people. Like all delta
            environments, Bangladesh is a hotspot for natural disasters
            and climate change. Today, most Bangladeshis live in rural
            areas, but new employment opportunities in the industrial
            and service sectors have fueled urban population in recent
            years. Increases in labor incomes have been a main driver of
            poverty reduction and declining inequality. The structural
            shift from agriculture to industry and services has
            accelerated in recent years and created new and better paid
            jobs. In the non-agricultural sector, net employment rose by
            more than 10 million between 2002-03 and 2013, outstripping
            the 3.3 million increases in agriculture. Labor productivity
            increased dramatically across the board: the growth in
            output per worker was especially large in the industrial and
            agricultural sectors, while services also experienced a
            significant increase. Notwithstanding the fall in
            agriculture’s share in total employment, increases in farm
            incomes accounted for more than 90 percent of the poverty
            reduction between 2005 and 2010. Despite Bangladesh’s
            remarkable development achievements, significant challenges
            remain in its quest to eliminate extreme poverty. Bangladesh
            continues to be one of the poorest countries in the region,
            with constrained public services and comparatively weak
            institutions. Even though it has done fairly well in recent
            years, many others, e.g. China, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, have
            done much better.
