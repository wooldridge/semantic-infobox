&#13;
                                                                                 about that:     what he had been impressed with was that the Fund seemed&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Irving, we have talked a lot about your ezperience in the Fund      to have a program of assessment and consultation with all countries, on&#13;
&#13;
and the reasons you came to the Bank to be The Economic Advisor to the           a periodic basis; the Fund seemed to have a view about countries, about&#13;
&#13;
President, but maybe you would briefly repeat that story and then deal           their â&#128;¢onetary and fiscal management, their balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
with the general questions:     What was it that you understood you weJ:"e       management and exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
being asked to do at the Sank?      and How were you going to go about                 He told â&#128;¢e that he didn't feel that the Bank had this.       They&#13;
&#13;
doing it?                                                                        didn't have a periodic program for assessing â&#128;¢ember countries. I&#13;
&#13;
FRIF.OHAN:     Well Bob, if I may repeat myself, because I am sure some of       remeâ&#128;¢ber at that time his citing, quite early, the experience with&#13;
&#13;
this has been said to you a number of times before, the initiative of            Bra~il:     the Bank had not had anything new in Brazil for years, because&#13;
&#13;
my going to the Bank came entirely from George Woods.         It isn't as if I   there had been joint U. S. -     Bra~ilian   commission which Burke Knapp had&#13;
&#13;
had any preconceived ideas of what I would like to do.        I had no idea      been on which had gotten into some difficulties, and the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
that I would ever be in the World Bank.     Despite very early interest          Brazil had broken off speaking to one another.        He cited this as an&#13;
&#13;
back in Treasury days in the World Bank, I had remained a person whose           example of what shouldn't happen.&#13;
&#13;
interest in the Bank really was largely formed by the responsibilities           OLIVER:     Would there have been in the Fund actual annual reviews?&#13;
&#13;
and the work I was doing in the International Honetary Fund.                     FRIEDMAN:     Oh yes.   The system, which I may say I invented as well as&#13;
&#13;
     I wasn't really all that familiar in detail with what the World             administered, provided for an annual review with all countries under&#13;
&#13;
Sank was doing.     So when I went to the World Sank, although I had lived       AJ:"ticle Fourteen.     By this time, it had   also been applied to Article&#13;
&#13;
just a few feet away, I wasn't all that much more knowledgeable about            Eight countries, which meant all member countries.        We didn't always&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank than someone might have been who lived     8   few hundred        succeed in having a review of all countries.       Sometimes there would be&#13;
&#13;
miles away.       think that is kind of important.   Secon&lt;lly, when Woods       a technical difficulty. like a ministry nor prepared to talk because it&#13;

personnel.     The large majority of countries were done every year, and,      the United States.     The logical bridge institution was the Bank, and&#13;
in principle, the countries agreed to have consultations every year in         he, Jack Kennedy, wanted George Woods to build a bridge between the&#13;
the field.                                                                     United States and the developing countries.     That was why he was asking&#13;
     The Fund consultations were the first of their kind; it had never         Woods to be President of the World Bank.     And Woods turned to me and&#13;

doing its own assessment periodically on behalf of an international            anything very precise, but there was the idea the major institution to&#13;
group, in this case the International Monetary Fund, was novel.                bridge the developing world and the United States was going to be the&#13;
     Where Woods bad gotten such a high regard for this process, 1             World Bank.     Hr. Woods was going to build the bridge, and I was going&#13;

had annual consultations with members of the Fund.       I don't really know   OLIVER:     Hay I interrupt?   This luncheon where you were talking to&#13;
where be got my name.     We had a number of mutual friends, people like       Woods about these issues -- was this the luncheon when he was a"king&#13;
Hartin and Andy Overby.     The chances are there is someone I haven't         you to come?     Was this the first time that you had met him tace to&#13;
even thought of who gave him the idea of asking me to come and do in           face?&#13;
the Bank what I bad done in the Fund.                                          FRIEDMAN:     When he first asked me to consider coming was the tirst time&#13;
     The other point that he made very early in the game -- I don't            I had met hiâ&#128;¢, I would say, face to face. We might have said, "Hello."&#13;
dare say, Bob, that I can remember the chronology of these events; I           at a Governor's Conference,     I surely had not had more than a few words&#13;
&#13;
know it was very early, before I decided to come, and I was very               with him before.     It was my first conversation with the man.   Then we&#13;
interested in what I was going to do and why he wanted it done.         He     had a series of luncheons at which we discussed my coming, all of which&#13;
made the point that he had been pulled into his job by President               occurred within about two weeks. That's why I say, I don't remember the&#13;
&#13;
Kennedy, whom be obviously greatly admired, although I believe Woods           chronology of it.&#13;
was a Republican.    Kennedy had spoken to him about the fact that United      OLIVER:     All, I guess, ]n the late spring or early summer of 19o41&#13;
&#13;
States foreign policy had one great weskness and that was its relations        FRIEDMAN:     It was in the early summer; I would have guessed the llpring&#13;
&#13;
with developing countries.     lf   anything, there was a widening (I think    or early summertime.     We were visiting Ednto's mother in Ridge! icld,&#13;

&#13;
summer, and it vas decided over the phone what my title would be.        I      assurances." (Woods was a very practical person about salary and&#13;
&#13;
was visiting there over the weekend.       I did not try to record our          tenure.     It was a sensible thing to consider.   He never was embarrassed&#13;
&#13;
meetings, but I'm sure it's recorded aoâ&#128;¢evhere.                                 about talking about things like tenure and salary.       He thought it was&#13;
&#13;
        Then we talked about what I would do.   We talked in terms of the       perfectly reasonable that someone should be concerned about it. and I&#13;
&#13;
fact that there were two candidates in his mind -- two people -- one            found it very easy to talk about it.) He said, ''You will never suffer&#13;
&#13;
was Alec Cairncross and the other myself.       Indeed, he asked me what I      from having come over to the World Bank."      That had a lot to do with my&#13;
&#13;
thought about Cai me ross.      told him I thought Alec Cairncross was great,   decision.&#13;
&#13;
that the World Bank would be lucky to have someone like Alec Cairncroas                 Again. at this point, we hadn't even talked title.    We had not&#13;
&#13;
come to the World Bank.      Hind you. at this point, were not talking          talked departments or anything el&lt;cept why he wanted me to come.            lie&#13;
&#13;
about departments, titles, or anything,     We were just talking about my       made the comment which       found very significant in light of my later&#13;
&#13;
coming to the Bank.     At some point during this early week, I reported        relations vi th Woods â&#128;¢.        Hind you at this time I don't know him:&#13;
&#13;
to him the view of Pierre Paul Schweitzer that if I came to the Bank,           I'm meeting him for the first time.       I can't remember how the point was&#13;
&#13;
it had to be as something that was equivalent to a promotion from the           provoked to be made.     He said that the reason I want you to come and&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund.     Woods said, MSure because you're going to be equivalent      develop this program is that I think that IDA has to become mare&#13;
&#13;
to Burke Knapp and Geoffrey Wileon who are my two vice presidents."             important than the World Bank.        really don't think that mast of these&#13;
&#13;
        Then, in the course of two weeks, he brought out the point that .he     countries that we're dealing with are the kind of countries that ought&#13;
&#13;
had committed himself also to make Sim Alderwereld a vice president,            to get a lot of loans from the World bank; they ought to get IDA.&#13;
&#13;
and that I would come in at a rank equivalent to that.       It was at that     While I'm here, we're going to try to make IDA bigger than the World&#13;
&#13;
time that he also made the point that if I caâ&#128;¢e to the Bank I would             Bank.     He went on to say, "I think I know about banks.      know about&#13;
&#13;
never suffer financially or career wise; I would have as a minimum the          how to decide to make a loan or not, but 1 don't know how to make a&#13;
&#13;
same tenure, the same assurances that I would have had staying in the           decision about IDA-- how to decide whether Pskistan and India and these&#13;
&#13;
Fund.    I told him what Schweitzer had said about being the Third Han in       other countries should have more or less."&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, and I never could be less for the rest of my career; and                      When he talks about creditworthiness in the Bank. which he&#13;
&#13;
Woods said. "Oh well, just tell Pierre Paul that it's going to be the           emphasi~ed    -- nr want you to work on creditwort:hinessu -- it 1 s       not    1hc&#13;

creditworthiness of a comaercisl bank.        He was not concerned that          Managing Director of the fund.     There was no title in the wÂ·orld Bank&#13;
&#13;
countries wouldn't repay the Bank.        The Bank already had a well-           that was better than the title I had, and no department or function in&#13;
&#13;
established policy of being a preferred creditor.        That was already the    the World Bank that was more attractive for me to head than the one&#13;
&#13;
cornerstone of creditworthiness to the World Bank:        borrowing countries    headed in the Fund.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
important borrowers from the Bank, like Brazil and Chile, had had debt           began in the Fund as head of the research on the United States and&#13;
&#13;
problems.       The practice had been well established that countries might      Canada.   As an economist, I was very proud of those positions.           This&#13;

lmport Bank, but they didn't restructure their debt with the World               Economic Advisors.     I was in touch with leading economists like&#13;
&#13;
Bank.       Woods was concerned, it seemed, more with the question of the        Smithies, Salant, Kuznets, Haberler and Samuelson.         I was innovating&#13;
&#13;
allocation of IDA funds,                                                         the integration of   ~onetsry   and national income analysis.       was&#13;
&#13;
        There was aueh to do.     At first much of our economic work revolved    revelling in being an economist.      I then became a Department Director&#13;
&#13;
around IDA, rather than around the World Bank.        How do we argue for a      in the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
bigger IDA7        How do we allocate IDA funds?   What is the role of                My new position was still that of an economist, but it was very&#13;
&#13;
consultative groups or consortia? What kind of a world can economists            applied. I was eager to be less applied.      That's why when Woods asked&#13;
&#13;
make?         Woods said, "I think economists are better than bankers in         for a title, and it couldn't be vice president,     !   was the one who said&#13;
&#13;
making judgements about things like IDA, so that is why I want you to            I'd be The Economic Advisor.     It was important that now I would have a&#13;
&#13;
be here."       Again we were not talking departments;   we were just talking    chance to be an economist with a Capital E.        I was going to be labeled&#13;
&#13;
about what to do and the reasons for my coming to the bank.        What          an economist.   I was going to be the Chief Economist of the World Bank,&#13;

really intrigued me about coming to the Bank was not a title nor a               and that was much more important to me than the rank or the money.&#13;

&#13;
     I offer this as a digression because it has a lot to do with my                      servant, I knew what it meant to have an outsider come in at the top&#13;

decision to go to the Bank and how l approached my new job. I wasn't                      rank and interfere with work.        It had happened to us in the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
called in to change anything that was going on in the World Bank.                1        never did it.      I didn't ever try to find out what individuals like Sim&#13;
&#13;
wasn't called in because Woods was unhappy about how the other work was                   Aldererweld did or how they managed their departments.         I never asked&#13;

being done. I was supposed to do an additional thing, to fill a gap                       Woods. what they were doing.       I never asked Woods what he thought about&#13;
&#13;
seen by Woods.    I was supposed to add to the Bank something it was not                  what they were doing.        Whatever he told me about them was because he&#13;
doing.   I wasn't there to abolish anything.          That's why it was quite             volunteered it.     I'm not an expert on what these people wereâ&#128;¢doing in&#13;

more people. I tried to put them into some â&#128;¢ore acceptable                                I've seen some of the minutes of the Senior Staff meetings.         They go&#13;

organizational structure.     I   ne~er   changed what Leonard Rist did.                  into some detail on some       occasion~   about things that were being done "'&#13;
&#13;
was not interested in that. I was interested in adding on          so~ething              various sections of the bank.       How did you participate?&#13;
&#13;
which would meet a need I felt 1 knew that        Wood~   wanted to do for the            FRIEDMAN:     I tried very hard to be a positive voice rather than&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and this became my definition of what I wanted to do,                               meddling.    For example, there was some discussion as to whether we&#13;
&#13;
     My view of the Bank then is that of an expert on what I did rather                   ought to expand in    educatio~     I supported it, because I thought it was&#13;
&#13;
than on what others did.    I didn't really make it my business to have a                 a good thing.     At that time, there were discussions as to whether we&#13;
&#13;
detailed view of what the projects or other people did. For          exa~ple,         1   ought to expand our consultative group work of which Dick Demuth was&#13;
&#13;
believe I could have gone to Loan         Co~mittee   if I had strongly   insi~ted.       largely in charge.     I was a strong supporter at these meetings as well&#13;
&#13;
I deliberately, Bob, for years      never attended a meeting of the Loan                  as in the President's Council.       J strongly supported the work of our&#13;
&#13;
Committee, because I did not want Burke Knapp and my colleagues to see                    relations with the UNDP and UNC'l'AD which primarily was the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         11                                                                               12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
responsibility of Dick      De~uth   again.   I was s strong supporter when I       discussion of the contributions to economic development of education&#13;
&#13;
could support something.                                                            and how one would go about analytically looking at education from the&#13;
&#13;
     I didn't get involved when the projects people reported that they              economic point of view.    I remember proposed educational loans coming&#13;
&#13;
had done a study.    I remember they did a study on whether they could              before the Economic Committee.       I had informal evening seminers with&#13;
&#13;
become more efficient and cut down the tiâ&#128;¢e necessary for project                   perticipants in our Economic Development Institute and for those who&#13;
&#13;
evaluation.    They had originally came out with the conclusion that they           cared to discuss new areas like health and education.&#13;
&#13;
couldn't make any appreciable reduction in t.he time spent. I didn't                        We discussed all the loans at the Economic Committee before they&#13;
&#13;
become pert of that controversy.         I deferred to aoâ&#128;¢eone like Burke           went to the Loan Committee, but our discussions were on the economics&#13;
&#13;
Knapp, who knew much more about project work than I did,             l gueu I       of the projecta.    I would try to use it as the occasion not merely for&#13;
&#13;
must have commented one way or the other, hut I didn't try to play an               a discussion of a    project~    se but also more broadly. I would like&#13;
&#13;
active role because I didn't feel I knew enough shout it.           But when it     to comment, at some point, about my view about the role of economics&#13;
&#13;
came to subjects like relations with the Monetary         Fu~d,   I played a very   which was quite different from the views of other people.&#13;
&#13;
active role because I knew the subject.                                             OLIVER:    Before we get onto that, I think it would be a good idea if&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     In the case of education or agriculture, did you ever suggest           you would say a bit about how the Economic Committee got started,&#13;
&#13;
that economic analysia R!! ae might. contribute to a better                         because it got started after you became The Economic Advisor.&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the importance of education or         agriculture~        !Â£1     FRIEDMAN:     The Economic Committee got started because I felt that if&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Yes, often.   When we had a general problem of economic               economics was to play a role in the Bank, it had to be operational.           It&#13;
&#13;
analysis in evaluating a project, one guessed that it would be                      couldn't be primarily background for decisions or long-term research&#13;
&#13;
discussed by our Economic Committee.          For example, on one occasion we       studies.    This was the lesson I learned from my experience in the&#13;
&#13;
had a discussion of palm oil in West Africa and the financial return on             Monetary Fund.     I'll be glad to elaborate that separately:       How to&#13;
&#13;
the project (I think it was in the Ivory Coast, if I remember correctly),           build a mechanism into the Bank so that the economic analysis of the&#13;
&#13;
and that the internal rete of return was not good enough to meet the                country becomes a major element in the deci6ion-making of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank's standards.    This led to an extensive discussion of        shado~           Bank?&#13;
&#13;
pricing.    This exemplifies what I thought was the proper role that I                      Economic Judgement as such   ~   not the focal point of !! tent ion in&#13;
&#13;
could play to inform some of these -- like in education:           we had a         the Bank. 1 believed it should be, and my proposed      mech8ni~m    was au&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       13                                                                                       14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee composed of all departaents which would review all                establish itself vis-a-vis the Bank.    The Bank was the       mo~e     senior&#13;
&#13;
loan proposals before they went to the Loan Committee. as well as other              institution of the two, and the Fund was pretty self conscious.                 This&#13;
&#13;
economic matters.    I mentioned this proposal to Woods.     I don't think           came out in all sorts of things. including who gave luncheons at the&#13;
&#13;
it took more than one or two conversations and we had it going.             I told   Governor's Conferences. who spoke first and who was the spokesman for&#13;
&#13;
him, as far as I wsa concerned. l wanted all the departments on it.                  the two of them.   Whenever that came up. it was usually the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
including the Projects Department as well as the Ares Departments.                   Veterans of the Fund like myself smarted under this for years.              We felt&#13;
&#13;
     I got splendid cooperation froa most meâ&#128;¢bers of the Committee.                  that we were as good as the Bank, but the world didn't seem to agree&#13;
&#13;
from people. for eiample. like Takahashi. who. at this point. was the                with this.&#13;
&#13;
chief economist in agriculture.      Takahashi was very good in bringing to               The other side of the coin was that the Fund was pretty sensitive&#13;
&#13;
the Economic Committee some questions of the economic analysis of                    about formal relations with the Bank.     I canvassed the ares department&#13;
&#13;
agriculture projects.    Obviously, like anything else. the degree of                directors of the Fund at that time and asked them whether or not they&#13;
&#13;
cooperation and enthusiasm varied from one group to another.       I                 would be prepared to come informally to our meetings whenever their&#13;
&#13;
remember very vividly those people who accepted and cooperated.         We had       countries were being discussed.   Everyone of them cooperated -- like&#13;
&#13;
some people in the Bank who never accepted this special work, who                    Jorge del Canto in Latin America or John Gunther in the Middle East.&#13;
&#13;
always thought that there was enough economic work done in connection                We never (never maybe is too strong}. nearly never, perhaps never, had&#13;
&#13;
with a loan for the Loan Committee.      They could not see why it was               a meeting on country in the Economic Committee where the head of the&#13;
&#13;
necessary or desirable to have a separate discussion in the Economic                 department of the Fund did not come unless he was out of the country,&#13;
&#13;
Committee. or, for that matter. separate economic analysis apart from                in which case he would send hia deputy.    I always made it a point in&#13;
&#13;
the loan analysis.                                                                   the Economic Committee that we never had a view of a country without my&#13;
&#13;
     1'he other point that I made that was innovative. i f I may use that            calling on a Fund person to give his view as seen by the Fund -- to&#13;
&#13;
word. was that I wanted the Monetary Fund to sit in on our                           make sure we didn't have silent representation.&#13;
&#13;
deliberations.   That was really very. very different. and I knew at                 OLIVER!   Can you illustrate what kind of issues the Economic Committee&#13;
&#13;
that time the Monetary   Fu~d   would not welcome this in a for mal way.             dealt with?   Was it defined in the discussion of the rate of growth"/ or&#13;
&#13;
They were not ready for close and formal relations between the Fund and              the measurement of Gross National Product? or the amount of saving that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.   This is a point in time when the Fund was still trying to                could be generated by one program or an&lt;&gt;ther?    All of   t   hese"l&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              15                                                                                    Jb&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Not quite.    The way I distinguished between the Fund and the                   In the World Bank. we were much more concerned with the use of&#13;
&#13;
Bank   econo~ically   was that the Bank was essentially concerned with the                borrowed funds and with the appropriateness of its use.           We had a lot&#13;
&#13;
strategy of economic development. with long-run planning and with the                     of discussion about whether or not s country like Thailand should&#13;
&#13;
implementation of that strategy. tbe as.essment of whether or not                         continue to receive funds from the World Bank.         Those were the days of&#13;
&#13;
countries had the right kind of strategy and had the right kind of                        the military build-up, and Thailand was being tlooded with U. S. dollar&#13;
&#13;
policies for the implementation of that strategy and whether they had                     income. Should Thailand continue to be eligible for Bank loans?            We had&#13;
&#13;
the right kind of institutions and institutional practices. That's how                    discussions on whether or not Japan was still eligible for the World&#13;
&#13;
I distinguished the Bank      fro~   the Fund.     I knew   fro~    ay own eaperience     Bank or should Japan be cut off1        We also had discussions on' industries&#13;
&#13;
that the Fund did not cover these aspects.            We caae up to that gate.            and sectors:     Should we   make 1 oans in industries like Tourism or St'eel&#13;
&#13;
but we didn't walk through that gate.            This guided ae in the work of            or Oil1     Woods' point of view got discussed:     we really should not&#13;
&#13;
the Economic Committee.       In the Economic      Co~mtttee.      questions were         be in those industriesÂ·where the private sector was quite willing to&#13;
&#13;
directed toward what       me~bers   thought of the   econo~ic      strategy in the       provide the investment.       If the countries didn't want to have them,&#13;
&#13;
country under consideration?         Did they have the right ktnd of                      that was their own decision.      There was no reason why the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
implementation?       Some times questions of fiscal policy were raised. or               should step in and be a substitute.         Those are the kind of issues that&#13;
&#13;
questions about pricing policy.         If questions about ezchange rates                 we discussed.&#13;
&#13;
arose, I would turn to the person from the Monetary Fund:                 ''What do you   OLIVER:     Did the issue of absorptive capacity get talked about7&#13;
&#13;
think about this1"      Someti~es,    it was co111modity pricing or the                   FRIEDMAN:     Yes. a number of times.&#13;
&#13;
treatment of foreign investments.                                                         OLIVER:     Talking generally, of course. and    inco~e   distribution?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Is it fair to say that the discussions were more concerned                    FRIEDMAN:     I think so.    I'm not sure that the categorization would be&#13;
&#13;
with questions of growth and growth strategy than with simple                             the same then as now or the way these things came up for          consideratio~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness?                                                                         One of the new things I was asked to do was in connection with the&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Oh yes, definitely.      We didn't spend much time on                       issues that had been raised in the UNCTAD world.          UNt."l"AD reflected&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness. I now realize. after going to Citibank, that to be                      more of the general debate about economic development than most any&#13;
&#13;
concerned with creditworthiness really means you're worried about being                   other place, because it had j usc    co~e   into existence in 19b0 and ha&lt;l&#13;
&#13;
repaid.                                                                                   had only one or maybe two 111eet ings -- maybe in 'bO and 'b4, l forget.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        1}                                                                                       18&#13;

It still had Prebisch as the head of it and was the institution that                capital-output ratios were in different countries.          We had Â·an early&#13;
&#13;
was intellectually inspiring people.          The idea of the first development     study on Turkey, and a four-to-one ratio had been deduced from the&#13;
&#13;
decade came out of UNC'l'AD, I believe.                                             available evidence at the time,        E~perta   kept on using capital- output&#13;
&#13;
      The Supplementary Finance Proposal originated in an UNCTAD                    ratios of four to one.        We made esti=ates of    foreign-e~change   earnings&#13;
&#13;
resolution.        Another question was the external debt question.     Capital     that   ~ere   equally arbitrary.    Thus I had no confidence whatever in the&#13;
&#13;
~equi~emenrs        was another subject in which we worked.   People who were       projections being made, including those which were being advocated by&#13;
&#13;
doing quantitative analysis in econoâ&#128;¢ic development were making                     Prebisch at the time.&#13;
&#13;
estimates of capital requirements.          They differed, and this became very            Part of my job was to explain to Woods this intellectual&#13;
&#13;
important because one of the early questions Woods gave to me was:            How   controversy that was going on and the significance of it for those of&#13;
&#13;
big should IDA be?         What do we go for7   In Wood's 11ind, that was a         us in the business of development finance.           It was a very important&#13;
&#13;
question for an economist to answer which he particularly addressed to              practical question.      I   took the point:   What kind of inhibition is&#13;
&#13;
me.   I was the one who caâ&#128;¢e up with the idea of a four-fold increase in            being placed on social-economic development by the lack of foreign&#13;
&#13;
IDA   f~om    $250 million to $1 billion.                                           eichange1       What productive investments could be made if foreign&#13;

        I    found myself involved in this discussion of capital                    exchange were available1        At this time, remember, absorptive       capa~ity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
requirements.         I evolved a new technique which was circulated to the         waa very much in the forefront of economic developing thinking.                   John&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee and others.          It was discussed by the Economic            Adler, for example, in the World Bank, had written on this subject with&#13;
&#13;
Committee.        We discussed both the methodology I used and the results.         great authority,      I did not pretend to do an academic exercise in&#13;
&#13;
I don't know if you want me to summari:r.e how we did it, but .â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢                  absorptive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:       I   think at the very least you should identify the article so I             I told Woods that 1 would try to approach the subject          f~om    the&#13;

can go read it.                                                                     viewpoint of the World Bank.        We did something that was really quite&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDHAN:         I'll find it,   One version came out in Finance and               original.      J asked all of the people in the World Bank who worked on&#13;
&#13;
Development.        You have access to the archives.    There are much better       countries to give me their judgement based on their knowledge and&#13;
&#13;
things in there.                                                                    experience as to what amount of capital -- external capital                  could be&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
replies.     I think it included Bob de Vries and Ravi Gulhati, but             the issues involved and what I thought was a reasonable policy&#13;
&#13;
I'm not quite sure that I am remembering the right people.                      position for the World Bank.         This was when I tried to eiplain to&#13;

FRIEDMAN:      Ravi Gulhati,   He was one of the whiz kids in the World         the way one did projections, models, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Bank at this point.     He is still there.    We surveyed the countries and            One of the persons who became an admirer and my great support&#13;
&#13;
came out with a total of $4     billio~    This was the collective opinion of   at this time was Barbara Ward.         Hr. Woods had a great respect for&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank economic staff.                                                  Barbara Ward.     I had the feeling that after I told him something, be&#13;

&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Per year in the foreseeable future, I think it was.     (I want   being sensible.     I don't think he had as many friends in the academic&#13;
&#13;
to check that beck.     I hsven't looked at it since then.)      We then        world as someone like McNamara.         He may also have been talking to Ed&#13;
&#13;
looked at the countries to judge which were IDA worthy and which were           Hasan, who was often in the Bank.         "Ed Hason," he said, "He's over the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank worthy.     If I remember correctly (this is the methodology         hill; any guy who's 71 is over the hill."         He never took Ed Hasan&#13;
&#13;
even if the numbers are wrong), we came out with something like $2              seriously.   He never took John De Wilde seriously, and John was a very&#13;
&#13;
billion of the $4 billion ought to be on IDA terms.       We then made a        bright person.    I don't know why, but it was already so before       1   came.&#13;
&#13;
purely political judgement that we at the World Bank ought to go for            Otherwise, why wasn't John a candidate for my job?&#13;
&#13;
half of it: we ought to aim to provide half of the grant funds from                    The senior economists in the Bank -- John Adler. John de Wilde,&#13;
&#13;
official sources.     It was by that kind of arithmetic that we got the $1      and Andy Kamarck -- were not Wood's idea of someone that he wanted to&#13;
&#13;
billion figure for IDA (plus $1 billion for the World Bank).                    be his top economist.       think partly it was because, in Wood's mind,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     This was done in '65 was it1                                        I was his Economic Advisor as well as adalinistrator of the economic&#13;

                                                                                comfortable in talking to. that he could have confidence in--&#13;

confidence in his ability and confidence in the way he dealt with              happened.     The loan   office~s,   the people heading the area departments,&#13;
&#13;
George Woods.      I managed to eKplain things to Woods in such s way          wanted to have economists as advisors, not as deputies, so economists&#13;
&#13;
that he did not feel that he was a nicoapoop because he didn't know            E!!    ~   never did   become anything    mo~e   than advisors.    It just didn't&#13;
&#13;
the Two-Gaps Theory.                                                           seem important enough to Woods.          As long as my own position was strong&#13;
&#13;
       I suspect     the~e we~e   other people in the Bank who had that        and he consented to      suppo~t   my personal position when an issue came to&#13;
&#13;
facility, but I had it.     I would have thought that Jerry    Alte~   could   his attention, it did not seem to matter much.&#13;
&#13;
have done the job.     I would h.ve of thought that Andy Kaasrck could                    He and I agreed to the    p~incipal   that all the economists were&#13;
&#13;
have done the job.      He vas not that interested in how I    managed the     under my general monitoring.         I was responsible for the     prof~ssional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
economic work and staff.     This became a primary interest of McNamara,       standards of economics everywhere in the Bank including in project&#13;
&#13;
but not for Woods.     He was interested in the Economic Committee and         evaluation.      I tried to build the Econo.,ic Committee to the place&#13;
&#13;
what it did.     He was a stalwart supporter of it, but I don't think he       wher:e this would be implemented.         He agreed and it was so written up,&#13;
&#13;
ever asked detailed questions about its       organi~ation.                    but, aa a matter of fact, the economists in the Projects Department and&#13;
&#13;
       He usually supported me very strongly.        Occasionally he didn't    in the Area Departments looked to their own depart.,ent directors&#13;
&#13;
support me vigorously enough.       For example, one of the earlier            primarily rather than to me.         Whenever anything came up and r would&#13;
&#13;
thoughts I had was that, in order to make the economists in the Bank           find that I hadn't even been consulted and Andy Kamarck hadn't been&#13;
&#13;
more important, each area department head ought to have a deputy for           consulted, the answer would be, they were told by their Director, Sim&#13;
&#13;
econo~ics.     The director of the area department would be its chief          Aldervereld, "Forget it, Just go ahead and do it the way we tell you&#13;
                                                                                                                                         '&#13;
loan operations officer.     That was the primary role of the director         to."   I never remember going to Woods about this.            I would not have&#13;
&#13;
but there was no such a thing as econoâ&#128;¢ic work in the Bank divorced            bothered      Woods.   When he heard rumors and asked, my usual reply was&#13;
&#13;
from loan work.    The major integration of economic and loan activities       that I killed my own snakes.         That was !Y job. I had to worry about&#13;
&#13;
took place when a loan decision was made.                                      things like how to get the economics people to be more influential.&#13;
&#13;
         think it should be in the Archives that I proposed. after                         When I tried to have a population economist appointed, knowing&#13;
&#13;
speaking to Woods about it, that the department directors have a               Woods and his interest in population, I got turned down by&#13;
&#13;
deputy director for economics.       Woods didn't take the proposal very       Administration on the grounds that it was improper for the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
strongly one way or the other.       He supported it, but it never             have a population economist.         Woods didn't fight for it.       He sHid,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     23                                                                             24&#13;

&#13;
organization of the economics work, he just left it to me.     If I said    contradiction, s little bit of a contradiction, between your saying&#13;
&#13;
I vas in dire straights, he would help 11e out.                             that you thought of the economics work as being operationally&#13;
&#13;
          I really had a tremendous a.ount of freedom of action and a       oriented, on the one hand, but at the same time your being concerned&#13;
&#13;
tremendous feeling of support which everyone in the bank recognized.        with the economice of development as a subject,    ~ ~Â·         on the other&#13;

They always knew, if they were dealing with 11e, they were dealing with     hand. I'm also trying to get at the issue of how you have seen the&#13;
&#13;
someone who in the end the president was going to support if I made an      economics work while you were heading it up in the Bank BG being&#13;
&#13;
issue of it.     The organizational techniques, the structures, the         different in any sense from the economics work which preceeded your&#13;
&#13;
management methodology seemed to be so11ething he didn't care much          being in the Bank and the economics work that is more associated with&#13;
&#13;
about.    He was much â&#128;¢ore interested in my views on substance.    for      a later period.&#13;
&#13;
eKample, he would hBVe long discussions with me about inflation,            FRIEDMAN:     Well, I'll tried to describe it; then maybe we can go back&#13;
&#13;
though I never succeeded in getting hiâ&#128;¢ to put some paragraphs in his       and draw the contrasts,     I will try to deGcribe it as accurately as&#13;
&#13;
annual speeches on inflation -- this wae in the '608 --. how inflation      can recall.     I think first, perhaps, 1 should say that, having come&#13;
&#13;
was going to becoâ&#128;¢e a great menace to economic and social development.      from the Monetary Fund, I had become convinced that the Fund could not&#13;
&#13;
I believe he chatted with others who aeeured him that inflation was         have the same policy for developing countries BG for developed&#13;
&#13;
not worrisome.     Others probably told hiâ&#128;¢ that my views were silly.       countries.     I had been the leader of the view that the Fund rules on&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢rrving, you know, he comes from the Monetary fund; they focus on           restrictions on ezchange rates and ezchange restrictions          ~hould    not be&#13;
&#13;
things like inflstion."     And he wouldn't put it in his speeches, but     applied to developing countries the same way aG to developed&#13;
&#13;
loved to talk about it. He loved to chat about absorptive capacity and      countries.    They could not be ezpected to live in a regime of unitary&#13;
&#13;
development strategy pricing.     He thought this was fascinating stuff.    and stable freedom of convertibility and from exchange restrictions on&#13;

Whether we organized the economics work with three departments or one       current paymentG.&#13;
&#13;
department, or what you called it, just didn't seem to be Gomething he                   That had been a great issue in the Fund.        (This i6 not&#13;
&#13;
cared about much,                                                           irrelevant to your question, Reme111ber I'm the same person.)         The    ~Â·und&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:    May we talk a bit about thiG question that you referred to       Articles of Agreements had envisaged that the transitional&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    25                                                                          26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
arrangements under Article 14 would only last five years -- within          help achieve eventually the pre-conditions for sustained growth.&#13;
&#13;
five years after 1946 all countries were supposed to establish regimes      There were important consequences for economic policy and financial&#13;
&#13;
which were free froâ&#128;¢ restrictions on current payments or at lesst a         policy management in this approach which the lending countries&#13;
&#13;
regiâ&#128;¢e in which the case of restrictions required Fund approval.      If    thoroughly appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
applied, this exchange regime would â&#128;¢ean the convertibility of the                    I guess maybe one other view 1 had is at least worth&#13;
&#13;
country's currency and non-discriminatory foreign trade.     I had fought   mentioning.   I shared the conviction of the Fund staff that good&#13;
&#13;
that rule as unrealistic for most lending countries.     By the time I      monetary and fiscal policy was really a pre-condition to sound&#13;
&#13;
left the Fund, eighteen years after 1946, the great majority of the         development, even though it was difficult to achieve and maintain.       The&#13;
&#13;
developing countries were still under Article 14, which is a â&#128;¢uch more      best environment for economic development was sound monetary and fiscal&#13;
&#13;
flexible regime.    After I left, the Fund began to move countries to       policy.   With such policies, it could be possible to avoid significant&#13;
&#13;
Article 8 status.   All the so-called Article 8 lending                     inflation, multiple currency practices, and intensive use of trade and&#13;
&#13;
countries became countries with large-scale use of restrictions,            payments restrictions.    I had the conviction when I came to the Bank&#13;
&#13;
discrimination, â&#128;¢ultiple exchange rates, unable to live up to               that. on the one hand, developing countries were different from&#13;
&#13;
convertibility rules.   All the countries we agreed to in the 1950s         industrial countries and, on the other hand, that the philosophy we had&#13;
&#13;
like France, England, Germany and Japan -- that moved to Article 8,         in the Fund was sound.    I propagated the view within the Bank that&#13;
&#13;
stsyed as countries with relative freedom froâ&#128;¢ restrictions as payâ&#128;¢ent      whenever we had a conflict on fiscal or monetary    questions, we should&#13;
&#13;
lessons were very fresh in my mind when I joined the Bank.                  ask the Fund people what they thought,   We should go along with what&#13;
&#13;
           I had written memoranda to Jacobbaon about how we in the Fund    they thought was good fiscal and monetary policy.    At least that's&#13;
&#13;
should pay much more attention to the special problems of developing        where we should start.    We shouldn't be trying to second guess the&#13;
&#13;
countries, and he had agreed.   That was one of the reasons l became        Monetary Fund in their areas of expert knowledge and responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
the trouble shooter on the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina. As a          This was not particularly welcomed by some of my colleagues in the&#13;
&#13;
monetary economist, he thoroughly accepted the idea, thinking less of       Bank, who felt they knew as much about these matters, and maybe did, as&#13;
&#13;
these countries because they couldn't live up to the Fund principles,       the staff in the Monetary Fund.&#13;
&#13;
but nevertheless understanding that they couldn't in practice.                        When I came to the Bank. therefore, I was very much    concern~d&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~mphasis   in the Fund was, he agreed, on working with such countries to    with the fact that in the Bank economics was a secondary profession,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         27                                                                               28&#13;

that in the Bank if a staff person wanted to be iâ&#128;¢portant he no longer             economists.     They were applying them to a set of problems which had&#13;
&#13;
carried the label of economist,        I had been very impressed as an             been given to these institutions as their international&#13;
&#13;
outsider by how many of my friends who were economists in the World                responsibilities.    They were no less economists in the Fund or in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank had left their roles as econoâ&#128;¢ists,         If you asked them what they       Bank than they were in the academic world.      In the World Bank or the&#13;
&#13;
did, they would tell you they were loan officers, a metaâ&#128;¢orphosis we               Monetary Fund, the professionalism of economics had to be on the same&#13;
&#13;
never had to go through in the Monetary Fund.         I never stopped being        celiber as ecademic.&#13;
&#13;
an economist because I left the Research Departâ&#128;¢ent and went into                          This does not mean that everybody had to heve a formal degree&#13;
&#13;
other activities in the Fund.        No one ever stopped calling me an             in economics,     There were a lot of people in England who didn't have&#13;
&#13;
economist. I was still ezpected to give scholarly papers,           I fostered     formal degrees, but the work done had to     ~eet   high professional&#13;
&#13;
.2!!!.f   Papers.    We got people to finish their Ph.D. degrees,      I got the   standards,    Low stendards could not be ezcused on the grounds that,&#13;

&#13;
matter in what department they were.         They never ceased to be               because whet was im.portent was being a loan officer.          did&#13;

professional econoâ&#128;¢ista,                                                           everything I could to build the position of the      econo~ists   and the&#13;
&#13;
           ~hen     I got to the Bank, I found that the economics profession       economics profession within the Bank.     The resistence I got wes not&#13;
&#13;
was highly regarded.        Indeed, it was one of the ways in which you            that the economists weren't good, or not useful: but that economists&#13;
&#13;
becsâ&#128;¢e a loan officer.        But the profession of economics as such was          could remein economists and be operationally important was something&#13;
&#13;
practiced by people who wanted to be called economists.        There were          that seemed to be strange to a number of people there. If you were an&#13;
&#13;
some outstanding ezamples, like John Adler or Drag Avramovic, but they             economist, you were en edvisor -- you commented on things, you&#13;
&#13;

already at Yale.     I gave Guy the mandate to develop a long-term           interested in the subject very much, and we had a couple of&#13;

until the 1970s that such issues becaâ&#128;¢e fashionable in development             economic and social development. When there was a meeting in,Beirut of&#13;

&#13;
     One of the major changes that took place in the World Bank was            people who were invited were Jan Tinbergen and myself.       Now, I would&#13;
&#13;
that, before Woods came, the World Bank did not have a preeminent              like to think that the invitation was partly personal, but it also&#13;
&#13;
position as it did later in the field of economics.        When we went out    reflected my position as head of Economics at the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
to recruit people for the World Bank, we did not have the reputation                I don't believe the Head would have been invited to such events&#13;
&#13;
among the econoâ&#128;¢ica profession that had already been achieved in the           three years before.     I think I had becoâ&#128;¢e the personification of the&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund.    By the time the early years of McNamara were over, but       World Bank's economic staff and work.       It doesn't matter.   We were one&#13;
&#13;
largely accomplished under Woods, we were already the single most              of the great groups for economic work, and I think that has lasted to&#13;
&#13;
important group of economic talent in the development world.        It did     this day.     Hollis Chenery came and improved it.    Anne Kruger came, and&#13;

the evolution of world events.     It came as a deliberate decision that       better, different and better. l'm sure.      But the fact is that the&#13;

academic   e~ercise.   The Bank should not try to be another MIT or                  When I pointed out to Woods, which he didn't seem to know, that&#13;
&#13;
another Caltech.       It should try to be different.   It is demonstrating   Burke Knapp had started as an economist and had had a successful&#13;
&#13;
that the profession has a â&#128;¢ajor role to play in dealing with the              career in economics before he became a loan     office~.    he was quite&#13;
&#13;
social, political, and economic problems of our tiâ&#128;¢es and can do so           iâ&#128;¢pressed.      It sort of gave him a new light on Burke Knapp.&#13;
&#13;
without surrendering its professional intesrity.        This is something I        I think I did a lot to make it possible for people like Jerry&#13;
&#13;
feel very strongly about,       I brought it froâ&#128;¢ the Fund to the Bank.       Alter to have   impo~tant   professional relationships with Woods. I gave&#13;

country risk work.       It's one of the things of which I aâ&#128;¢ very proud,     were able to deal with practical problems and their views were worth&#13;
&#13;
One of the few achieveâ&#128;¢enta of â&#128;¢Y life is this idea that intellectual         having on day-to-day problems with which Woods was dealing.           believe&#13;

&#13;
merely in technology where everybody recognizes it, but in real               institutions of that kind.     I think it is something that will last for&#13;
&#13;
thinking about practical probleâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢ and logical reasoning, there is a           a long tiâ&#128;¢e in the World Bank.&#13;

~       make aood decisions without this kind of intellectual input.          how it contrasted with what came later, as you asked.        I had become&#13;
&#13;
       I see this now in my work in the African Development Bank,             quite convinced that the Bank ought to do more in the way of balance-&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has becoâ&#128;¢e tbe model of how economic work becomes              of-payments financing. I had been all along urging that the Bank play&#13;
&#13;
integrated with decision-making of a day-to-day character.       That was     more of a role in advising governments and influencing governments on&#13;
&#13;
something that came in the Woods Administration which Woods personally        development management, on economic policies and financial policies&#13;
&#13;
greatly welcomed and seemed fully to understand:        the difference        which were important for the developaent process.      I had come to the&#13;
&#13;
between that and thinking of the Bank as another place where you have         conclusion that you can never have a real influence if you just do&#13;
&#13;
some leading intellectuals who do very interesting work, but to whom          project financing.      had more or less persuaded Woods of this, though&#13;
&#13;
you really don't pay much attention. That is what he was doing.          He   not his senior staff.    This was rellected in the Supplementary Finance&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         39                                                                          40&#13;

&#13;
       When McNamara caâ&#128;¢e in, he put a atop to the discussions on                believe that whatever research is done needs to be integrated into the&#13;
&#13;
suppleâ&#128;¢entary finance and indicated that he didn't think he could                operational needs and work of the institution.    It doesn't mean good&#13;
&#13;
aupport it at that tiâ&#128;¢e. It was atill a live iasue in international              decisions are not otherwise being made, but they are being made by people&#13;
&#13;
relations.     During our discussions on this matter, he asked â&#128;¢e, "Can          who are either non-economists or, even if they are economists, they are&#13;
&#13;
you do this proposal with projecta1â&#128;¢ I said, MWell it can be done; it            not being â&#128;¢ade to meet professional standards in the way in which&#13;
&#13;
is possible to have a shelf of projects which can be called upon to              economists use their economic tools and background in making those&#13;
&#13;
provide additional lending if desired.      Really, when it is all said          decisions.&#13;
&#13;
and done," I said, Mthat'a very close to balance-of-payments financing:          OLIVER:      can tell that you substantially increased the importance of&#13;
&#13;
it's just another way of describing it."      He said,    "!'â&#128;¢ not convinced     economists in the bank, that you substantially increased the&#13;
&#13;
of the desirability of balance-of-payments financing for the Bank.M              importance of economics and the awareness of economics, but I still&#13;
&#13;
called on Hollis Chenery, who had recently been the assistant head of            can't tell whether you also substantially increased the economics&#13;
&#13;
the foreign-aid agency, assistant administrator for econoâ&#128;¢ic work.           I   research that was being done at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
had   hear~   that Hollis had hiâ&#128;¢self been a champion of balance-of-             FRIEDMAN:    I'm not sure what you mean by economics research.   We&#13;
&#13;
payments financing while he was in AID.      I got Hollis in and told            increased the aâ&#128;¢ount of economic work that was done on economic&#13;
&#13;
Hollis what the issue was.      The issue was really a â&#128;¢ajor issue within        problems.    We did â&#128;¢ore work on pricing to judge an internal rate of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     Would he like to write a zemoranduâ&#128;¢ on it?      I would            return, assessing development strategy, judging investment programs.&#13;
&#13;
appreciate it very much if he would.                                             Is that economic research?    These kinds of subjects were investigated&#13;
&#13;
       Well, he wrote it, but it was completely inadequate: it would             more in depth as the expansion of economics work went    o~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
not have been worthy of an Economics One student, and yet it was                      In addition, there were other areas of work which we expanded. We&#13;
&#13;
written by one of the best brains in our field.      I can only understand       expanded thinking and knowledge like on the problem of eiport short&#13;
&#13;
it on the ground that be wasn't really interested.        McNamara finally       falls and their impact on development, We expanded knowledge about the&#13;
&#13;
turned me down decisivelyÂ· on the Bank's doing balance-of-payments               implication&amp; of different forms of development finance for the&#13;
&#13;
financing on the grounds that it could not be evaluated in                       development process.    People knew much more about it after our work&#13;
&#13;
precise quantitative terms.                                                      than they did before.    It wasn't labeled a research project, but the&#13;

exaaple, the    Suppleaenta~   Finance Proposal which, in ay opinion, was    FRIEDMAN:     I think so, because that also helps recall.&#13;
&#13;
an original study.      The reason vby I hesitate to call it a research      OLIVER:     I think this has been a very good session.    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
project ia because I knew there were aany things at the tiae that, if&#13;
&#13;
we had an indefinite aaount of tiae, I would have liked to have looked&#13;
&#13;
into more deeply.&#13;
&#13;
          A research project in ay aind is one that e&amp;hausts the product:&#13;
&#13;
you feel confident that you have looked at     ave~thing   that you could&#13;
&#13;
lo~     at before you come to conclusions.   It's hard to do what I regard&#13;
&#13;
as true research in an institutional fraaevork, because that&#13;
&#13;
institutional fraaework tends to give you a guideline, if nothing else&#13;
&#13;
a time limit, which imposes a constraint that, I think, a true&#13;
&#13;
scientific research worker finds very, very onerous to live by.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I think aaybe one way to set at this another tiae (I tbink we&#13;
&#13;
ought to stop now} is to put down a list of the kinds of issues that&#13;
&#13;
were dealt with by the econoaiats and your staff over a period of five&#13;
&#13;
years.    What were the questions they were seeking answers to7     Maybe&#13;
&#13;
by talking about that a little bit, we can illuainate thia.       But I&#13;
&#13;
think we'd better do that another tiae.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Fine.   I would urge you to talk also to Andy Kamarck about&#13;
&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Oh indeed.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN: Because his memory might just be better than mine, or surely&#13;
&#13;
suppleaentary.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, 1 think, another time, we ought to talk about your work&#13;

            In March 1974, July and December 1985,
            June 1986, and February 1988, Irving S. Friedman was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver and Charles Ziegler.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1964 to 1974, Mr.
            Friedman worked as an economic advisor to the president of
            the World Bank (1964-1970); as chairman of the economic
            committee (1964-1970); and at the Economic Development
            Institute (EDI) as professor in residence (1971-1974). His
            transcripts exist as a seven volume set, consisting of one
            session in 1974 and eight sessions from 1985 to 1988. His
            transcript concerns his tenure at the Bank after working for
            the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was appointed by
            George Woods as his economic advisor. He discusses in detail
            the relationship of the IMF and the World Bank and
            propagating that development. .
