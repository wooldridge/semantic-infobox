LEVELS OF POVERTY: POLICY AND CHANGE&#13;
1.     Concepts of Poverty&#13;
1.1.   Absolute and Relative Standards&#13;
It is natural to view poverty as failure to meet the&#13;
basic requirements of a "decent" life. The concept of a&#13;
"decent" life does, of course, vary from society to society&#13;
(as Adam Smith (1776) had noted). While biological requirements&#13;
and nutritional norms provide the most elementary concept of&#13;
"basic requirements", the notion of deprivation has to be&#13;
considered in broader terms to come to grips with the modern&#13;
understanding of poverty. Over the last century, not only&#13;
has the context of "basic requirements" been progressively&#13;
revised, so has been the very method underlying the specificat-&#13;
ion of such requirements. The contrast between the nutritional&#13;
norms used by, say, Booth (1889) and Rowntree (1901), and the&#13;
rather more demanding requirements used for analysing "relative&#13;
deprivation" in works by such authors as Runciman (1966) and&#13;
Townsend (1974), reflect one such shift.&#13;
While this shift has been much discussed, it is possible&#13;
to argue that both absolute and relative deprivation are&#13;
essential ingredients of the common understandinq of poverty.&#13;
If people are dying of hunger in a famine situation, it is&#13;
legitimate to see it as a case of acute poverty even without&#13;
supplementing the analysis of the obvious absolute deprivation&#13;
1 For helpful comments and suggestions, I am most grateful&#13;
to Akbar Noman and Adrian Wood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
by some detailed probe into the relative picture. On the&#13;
other hand, even if no one goes hungry, but some are terribly&#13;
deprived compared with others and see their relative deprivat-&#13;
ion as acute, then it is legitimate to diagnose poverty,&#13;
even though the criteria here are entirely relative rather&#13;
than absolute.&#13;
It is fair to say that there have been many influences&#13;
working over the years towards making the relativist perspect-&#13;
ive more important. Not the least of these influences Xs&#13;
the very fact of economic progress, which has made poverty&#13;
and deprivation in terms in which Booth or Rowntree saw them&#13;
increasingly rare in many countries of the world. The attent-&#13;
ion has naturally shifted to more demanding requirements&#13;
reflecting the community's new-found standards.&#13;
There is, however, a danger in being too "modern"&#13;
about the notion of poverty, since economic progress has been&#13;
rather uneven internationally, and for many countries in the&#13;
developing world, the s-tandards used by Rowntree and Booth still&#13;
remain depressingly relevant. In studying poverty in the&#13;
so-called Third World, tlhe older notions of absoluLe deprivation&#13;
still have much to contribute.&#13;
But,at the same time, the observation of the progress&#13;
of advanced capitalist and socialist countries has aroused&#13;
expectations and led to the realization of possibilities&#13;
which make it natural to go beyond the calculus of just hunger&#13;
and nutrition in estimating and analysing poverty.    The standards&#13;
of absolute deprivation themselves have had relativist influnc(..:es&#13;
arising from international contrasts. There is, of coursc&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
nothing astonishing in this development of the concept of&#13;
poverty. &#13;
While amalgamating absolute and relative considerations&#13;
is a natural way of taking a broad international view of&#13;
poverty, a number of more specific issues have been raised&#13;
recently which require attention. These are taken up in&#13;
the next three subsections.&#13;
1.2.   Variability of Nutritional Norms&#13;
First, the cogency of nutritional norms has been&#13;
questioned because of the interpersonal variability of'&#13;
nutritional requirements and the existence of "adaptive&#13;
mechanisms" operating over time (see particularly Sukhatme&#13;
(1977, 1978), and Srinivasan (1979)). The critique acquires&#13;
particular force in view of the sensitivity of the poverty&#13;
measures to the precise nutritional norm chosen, e.g., varying&#13;
the nutritional norm from 90% of average requirement to 110%&#13;
of average requirement apparently increases the proportion of&#13;
the malnourished in Pakistan from 0% to 90% (Scandizzo and&#13;
Knudsen (1979), cquoted by Srinivasan (1979, p.14)).&#13;
Variation of nutritional needs can be related to group&#13;
parameters such as race, climatic conditions, etc., but it&#13;
can also occur as interpersonal variation even for the same&#13;
group-characteristics. The former can be explicitly taken-&gt;&#13;
into account in choosing nutritional norms for different&#13;
countries and even different groups within a country. The&#13;
latter is more problematic, but if the interpersonal variations&#13;
follow some simple pattern, then the average deprivation can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
be used to get an idea of the pattern of deprivation clustered&#13;
around that average. Given the adaptive mechanisms at work,&#13;
it is important that nutritional statistics be taken over&#13;
longer periods, and not be hooked to day to day variations&#13;
(see Srinivasan (1979)).&#13;
The problem of variability of nutritional norms is a&#13;
deep one, and the uncritical use of the "nutritional approach"&#13;
does deserve criticism. -However, in making this criticism&#13;
it is possible to overlook a simple point, to wit, malnutrition&#13;
can provide a basis for a standard of poverty without poverty&#13;
being identified as the extent of malnourishment. The level&#13;
of income at which an average person will be able to meet&#13;
his nutritional requirements has a claim to being considered&#13;
as an appropriate poverty line even when it is explicitly&#13;
recognized that nutritional requirements vary interpersonally&#13;
around that average.&#13;
To state that, say, "20 per cent of the population&#13;
failed to have incomes adequate for buying enough food to&#13;
meet the average nutritional requirements for that community"&#13;
is a statement about poverty of some interest of its own,&#13;
even though it is not at all equivalent to saying that "20&#13;
per cent of the population failed to meet their nutritional&#13;
requirements".  The two statements are of interest for rather&#13;
different reasons: the first enlightens us on income deprivation&#13;
related to some average standard (paying no attention to the&#13;
fact that some are luckier than others in terms of need for&#13;
income in meeting nutritional requirements), while the second&#13;
throws light on the prevalence-of actual malnourishment.&#13;
Indeed, Rawlsian analysis of justice in terms of holdings of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
"primary goods" amounts to deliberately choosing the. former&#13;
focus (see Rawls (1971, 1975), and while I have elsewhere&#13;
tried to argue that it is an inadequate focus (Sen (1979c)),&#13;
it can hardly be denied that it is of some substantial interest&#13;
of its own. Thus, considerations of average nutritional&#13;
requirements can be used for one perspective on poverty&#13;
even when nutritional requirements vary from person to person.&#13;
1.3.   Results, Not Inputs?&#13;
Second, there have been strong arguments in favour&#13;
of making poverty indicators geared towards measuring "results,&#13;
not inputs" (Morris (1979, p.32)), and there is by now a long&#13;
established tradition of preferring social indicators such&#13;
as life expectancy, literacy, etc., over malnutrition or&#13;
shortfall of incomes. Various composite indicators of results&#13;
have been proposed, and recently such indicators have been&#13;
extensively used instead of nutritional statistics and income&#13;
data.&#13;
There is indeed much to be said for focussing on&#13;
achievements rather than on contributory causes. Longevity,&#13;
in particular, is a widely approved index, and it is natural&#13;
that it should play an important role in the construction of modern&#13;
social indicators, such as Morris's (1979) "physical quality&#13;
of life index". On the other hand, there might be a danger&#13;
in taking too narrow - and too "final" - a view of results.&#13;
"Death" is, of course, an important possible result of&#13;
nutritional and other deprivations, but it is not the only&#13;
possible result. The suffering from hunger and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
deprivations is also a "result". Lack of food may lead to&#13;
death (a very bad thing1), but it can lead also to hunger&#13;
without leading to death (also a bad thing, even if not quite&#13;
so bad as death). The typical "quality of life index" takes&#13;
no note of the latter when it occurs without the former. But&#13;
it would be difficult to claim that suffering from hunger&#13;
does not affect one's quality of life unless one happens&#13;
actually to die frcm it!&#13;
One can, in fact, argue that the expectation of Wife&#13;
as an indicator should be used not in place of income statistics,&#13;
but married to income statistics. A poor person with low&#13;
income and low expectation life suffers on both counts, and&#13;
neither can represent the other in any fundamental sense.&#13;
In an earlier paper (Sen (1973b)) the case was made for judging&#13;
individual advantage in terms of expected life-time income,&#13;
which multiplies the expectation of life with the expected&#13;
value of mean annual income, and thus the GNP statistics and&#13;
longevity statistics have to be put together to judge over-all&#13;
advantage or disadvantage of a person.&#13;
One result of such a procedure is to increase - rather&#13;
than decrease - the interpersonal and international gaps,&#13;
since lower income is typically associated positively with&#13;
lower longevity, and the product of the two will slhow a bigger&#13;
relative gap than either. This result is in marked contrast&#13;
1 Wilfred Beckerman (1979b) argues powerfully that it isn't&#13;
a bad thing in itself, and while I don't agree, I also&#13;
believe that anyone believing life to be valuable in itself&#13;
must sort out for himself precisely where one might disagree&#13;
with Beckerman's reasoning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
with replacing income statistics by longevity statistics&#13;
(or using a "physical quality of life index" based on non-&#13;
income variables such as life expectation), which lowers&#13;
the gaps identified by income-based exercises (see Morris'&#13;
(1979) findings with his index based on life expectation&#13;
at age 1, infant mortality up to age 1, and the literacy&#13;
rate).&#13;
The important issue isn't the choice of a particular&#13;
grand measure of poverty or opulence, but to take note of the&#13;
various parameters that would enter an acceptably broad picture&#13;
of poverty or opulence. The non-income factors captured by&#13;
physical quality of life indices (particularly longevity and&#13;
literacy) are important, but so are income and consumption&#13;
statistics which have relevance that go well beyond longevity&#13;
or education.&#13;
1.4.   Distribution and Vulnerability&#13;
Third, no matter what parameter is chosen to reflect&#13;
individual poverty, there is the further problem of aggregation&#13;
to arrive at an over-all poverty irndex.  The most commonly&#13;
used measures tend to neglect the distributional questions&#13;
implicit in aggregation. The "head-count" measure of poverty,&#13;
for example, simply adds up the number of people whose income&#13;
fell short-of: the "poverty line", irrespective of how far .&#13;
short they respectively happened to be.&#13;
Various distribution-sensitive methods of aggregation&#13;
have been recently proposed (see, for example, Sen (1976a)).2&#13;
2 See also Sen (1973a, 1977a, 1979a), Anand (1979), Kakwani&#13;
(1978), Osmani (1978), Hamada and Takayama (1978), Takayama&#13;
(1979), Thon (1979), and Blackorby and Donaldson (1980),&#13;
among others.   .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
These take note not merely of the number of people falling&#13;
below the poverty line and their average "poverty gap",3&#13;
but also the distribution of the actual poverty gaps.&#13;
However, there is an aspect of the "distribution problem"&#13;
that is overlooked in these measures of poverty based on&#13;
realized deprivation. People's suffering from poverty in&#13;
situations of variability depends not merely on actual&#13;
shortfalls, but also on the possibility of shortfalls and&#13;
the sense of vulnerability. For a peasant to have to look&#13;
nervously at the sky searching for monsoon clouds is als.o&#13;
poverty. In fact, sources of vulnerability for many classes&#13;
of people in the developing countries extend well beyond&#13;
uncertainties of nature, and the economic systems create&#13;
fragility of various kinds.4&#13;
A person acquires income, or food, or other necessities&#13;
of life,by using the economic system in operation with its&#13;
legal and social structure. A labourer acquires his means of&#13;
survival by selling his labour power and buying goods with it.&#13;
Unemployment without social security,or other social support,&#13;
can make him go under. A craftsman may have to starve 'if&#13;
the demand for his craft products falls suddenly.&#13;
This question of vulnerability is difficult to capture&#13;
in quantitative terms, but it is an important aspect of poverty,&#13;
and does deserve attention. It will be taken up later in terms&#13;
3 See Beckerman (1979a) fo-r illuminating use and defence&#13;
of the alternative poverty-gap approach.&#13;
4 See Sen (1977b, 1980a, 1980b).&#13;

2.     Poverty. Longevity and Income Levels&#13;
Reliable poverty estimates are difficult to find for&#13;
many countries and they are very often non-comparable. Also,&#13;
the typical measure chosen is the simple one of head-count&#13;
ratio, i.e., the proportion of population having less t an&#13;
5&#13;
the poverty line income.    Even when good estimates exist,&#13;
it is usually quite difficult to use them for intertemporal&#13;
or international comparison. In checking comparative performance&#13;
of different countries in reducing poverty, the comparability&#13;
needed is both over time and across countries, since it requires&#13;
a ranking of the intertemporal performance of different countries.&#13;
There have, however, been some attempts at providing&#13;
comparative poverty data, and the results of one such attempt&#13;
will be used here. Ahluwalia, Carter, Chenery and Development&#13;
Policy Staff (1979) provide comparative estimates of head-&#13;
count poverty measure for 36 countries.  ti pTvhrty i1Lne&#13;
chosen is based on calorie requirements and constmlption&#13;
behaviour observed in the Indian economy (a country which&#13;
is distinguished both in terms of a large number of detailed&#13;
poverty studies6 as well as in terms of having almost certainly&#13;
5 There have, however, been some interesting empirical attempts&#13;
recently to apply the distribution-sensitive measures of poverty&#13;
to the data of particular countries or regions; see, for example,&#13;
Ahluwalia (1976), Alamgir (1978),   Anand (1977), Bhatty (1974),&#13;
Dutta (1978), Fields:(1979), Fish]ow (1977), Kakwani (1978),&#13;
Osmani (1978), Sastry (1978),          Seastrand and Diwan (1975),&#13;
among others. These have enriched our understanding of poverty&#13;
problems in particular countries, but cannot be easily used to&#13;
construct an internationally comparable picture.&#13;
6 See Srinivasan and Bardhan (1974) and the references to the&#13;
Indian literature there.   See also Lipton (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
the largest.absolute number of the poor in the world according&#13;
to virtually all standards of comparison). The specified&#13;
calorie requirement of 2250 per day seems to be reached in&#13;
India by around the 45th percentile income group, and&#13;
.Ahluwalia et.al. took that income level as the poverty line&#13;
for other countries as well. In Table 1 the poverty estimates&#13;
for 1975 are provided for 34 countries, being all countries in&#13;
the Ahluwalia-list which happened to have an income level below&#13;
$1,000 at the official exchange rate (and, equivalently' in&#13;
this particular case, below $2,000 with the Kravis-adjustment-&#13;
factor). The GNP per head of each country for 1975 with Kravis-&#13;
adjustment is also provided. Table 1 presents in addition&#13;
the expectation of life at birth at each country fDr 1977 as&#13;
given by the World Development Report 1979.&#13;
The first remark that I would like to make on the data&#13;
presented in Table 1 is the obvious one that GNP per head&#13;
and poverty relates quite closely. (The value of Spearman's&#13;
rank correlation coefficient is, in fact, .89, with z having&#13;
the convincing value of 5.10,)   However, there are some&#13;
differences between the two rankings and they are, of course,&#13;
very worth pursuing to get insight into policy issues.&#13;
In terms of lowness of poverty, the top three countries&#13;
in this list are Yugoslavia, Taiwan and South Korea. This&#13;
is of interest, but also of interest is the tendency of some&#13;
countries to have poverty levels a good deal lower than their&#13;
income rank would suggest. There are many ways of tracing&#13;
that difference, and the approach that will be used here&#13;
is the purely "ordinal" one of comparing reverse poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
ranks with GNP ranks and looking at the excess of the former&#13;
over the latter as an indicator of success.&#13;
This devised index of "net excess of poverty score"&#13;
might appear to be somewhat obscure.    Certainly the more&#13;
commonly used procedure would be some type of "regression&#13;
analysis" and looking at how a country is placed vis-a-vis&#13;
the regression line. There-is, however, some spurious&#13;
precision in using numerical values of income and poverty&#13;
to fit regression lines. A more "ordinal" approach would&#13;
be provided by using rank correlation, and then checking&#13;
the deviation of each country's actual rank of poverty&#13;
with its predicted rank of poverty.    The method of "net&#13;
excess of poverty score" provides essentially a similar measure.&#13;
If the lowness of poverty coorelates positively with income,&#13;
then the income rank is the predicted poverty rank, and the&#13;
''net excess of poverty score" measures the difference between&#13;
these two ranks.&#13;
The "net excess of poverty score" figures are presented&#13;
in col'xmn (5) of Table 1. Here the highest scorers are&#13;
South Korea and Sri Lanka, with Zambia coming third some&#13;
distance away.&#13;
It should be noted that such "net excess scores"&#13;
become more and more difficult to achieve as we move to&#13;
countries with higher and higher GNP per head, and indeed for&#13;
the richest country in this list (viz., Yugoslavia) a positive&#13;
excess score will be logically impossible. These two ways of&#13;
looking at poverty removal display, in fact, two opposite&#13;
biases. The net excess score, as I have just remarked, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
biased against the richer countries in the list. On the&#13;
other hand, to look just at lowness of the level of poverty&#13;
would tend to bias things in favour of the relatively richer&#13;
countries since income correlates positively and strongly&#13;
with lowness of poverty. It may be argued that the two&#13;
measures provide two different perspectives on poverty&#13;
removaLThe poverty measure itself reflects over-all achievement,&#13;
and this is naturally rather better for richer countries. The&#13;
net excess score measures achievement over the handicap. of&#13;
low income, and this gives the scope to poorer countries to&#13;
do comparatively well having some income handicap to get&#13;
over.&#13;
At the other end of the scale, the worst excess scores&#13;
(deficit scores really) in this list of countries come from&#13;
Peru, Mexico and Brazil, all from Latin America. But this&#13;
is only in terms of comparison with income position. If we&#13;
look instead at worst over-all positions as such, then the&#13;
countries that get isolated as being left with the worst&#13;
poverty problems are Ethiopia, Burma and Bangladesh, respectively.&#13;
Turning now to expectation of life at birth, the best&#13;
over-all achievements are those of Taiwan, Yugoslavia and&#13;
Sri Lanka, while the highest net excess scores over GNP&#13;
ranking can be found in Sri Lanka, Burma and Uganda respectively.&#13;
The statement about contrasting biases in the two perspectives&#13;
made in the context of poverty measures applies correspondingly&#13;
in this case as well, and both lists are worth considering.&#13;
The worst net excess scores on longevity are those&#13;
of Iran, Ivory Coast and Zambia, while the worst over-all&#13;
&#13;

performance can be seen in Ethiopia and Senegal, followed&#13;
by the cluster of Ivory Coast, Zaire and Sudan.&#13;
The good and bad performances as isolated by these&#13;
procedures are summarised in Table 2. Three different types&#13;
of countries seem to stand out in terms of achievements.&#13;
First, there is the group of export-oriented, early capitalist&#13;
countries in the shape of Taiwan and South Korea. Second,&#13;
there is the socialist country Yugoslavia. Third, there is&#13;
the mixed economy in the form of Sri Lanka, well-known for&#13;
its policies of social security. All these countries have&#13;
appeared in the top list at least twice, and indeed they&#13;
are the only ones to do so.&#13;
It is worth noting that the other countries that have&#13;
appeared in the top list, viz., Zambia, Burma and Uganda, not&#13;
only appear there only once, but are also compromised in terms&#13;
of achievement assessment in other ways. Zambia and Burma&#13;
also ma!ke the bottom list once, and there is some evidence&#13;
that Uganda's high net excess score of longevity over GNP&#13;
rank has been much helped by an unusually large fall in GNP&#13;
per capita during 1970-75 (see Morawetz (1977, p.78)).&#13;
Turning back now to the cases of clear success, it is&#13;
interesting that the list includes various political systems.&#13;
In pursuing the clue revealed by this preliminary analysis,&#13;
it would be obviously useful to see how the performance&#13;
of these countries stand up when other criteria are chosen,&#13;
and also to see whether other countries of similar political&#13;
systems show any such noticeable distinction.   In particular,&#13;
Table 1 is limited by having only one socialist economy, viz.,&#13;

Yugoslavia, and it will be useful to look at other socialist&#13;
countries in terms of those indicators for which data exist&#13;
for these countries. Also, since the similarity in the&#13;
economic performance of Taiwan and South Korea with that of&#13;
Hong Kong and Singapore have been frequently noted, we shall&#13;
have to watch out for these other Asian early capitalist&#13;
economies relying on export-expansion.7 Finally, as far&#13;
as Sri Lanka is concerned, it is rather unique because of&#13;
its ambitious social security system (despite its low GNP&#13;
level), but some times comparison has been made with Tanzania,&#13;
another mixed economy committed to government-led social&#13;
policy. Tanzania's performance in terms of the indicators&#13;
in Table 1 seems better than average, but not remarkably&#13;
so. When other indicators are considered, Tanzania's record&#13;
would have to be carefully reviewed.&#13;
Turning away now from good to bad performance, it would&#13;
appear that the distinction of having low net excess scores&#13;
goes to some Latin American economies, viz., Peru, Mexico and&#13;
Brazil. This may or may not be very significant, since these&#13;
are very rich countries comparatively speaking, and have a&#13;
tendency towards being pulled down in the calculation of&#13;
net excess scores. What is of some significance is the&#13;
fact that they do badly in terms of net excess score not in&#13;
the context of longevity, but in that of poverty. Since&#13;
poverty is measured here - as outlined-earlier - in terms of&#13;
income deprivation (vis-a-vis the Indian poverty line), -it&#13;
is of some considerable interest that Peru, Mexico and Brazil&#13;
7 See Chenery and Keesing (1978). and Little (1979b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
do so Lac2iv daspite having a high average level of income.&#13;
The finger points clearly at the distribution of income&#13;
prevailing in these countries.&#13;
The worst poverty levels are seen in Ethiopia, Burma&#13;
and Bangladesh. Of these, Burma has the redeeming feature&#13;
that it also makes one top list, viz., that of net excess&#13;
score of longevity. In addition, it is worth recalling&#13;
that Ethiopia and Bangladesh - but not Burma - are countries&#13;
in which severe famines have taken place quite recentlyt viz.,&#13;
in 1973 in Ethiopia, and in 1974 both in Ethiopia and in Bangladesh.&#13;
In the context of a malnutrition-oriented view of poverty, famines&#13;
clearly reflect cases of acute poverty, and their continued&#13;
prevalence in these countries within the last decade call&#13;
for special attantion. They also reflect the vulnerability&#13;
aspect of poverty rather starkly.&#13;
3.     Changes in Longevity and Literacy&#13;
The analysis of the preceding section was based on&#13;
current performance of different countries. It is interesting&#13;
to look also at changes in levels of performance over the last&#13;
couple of decades. Unfortunately, no poverty estimates exist&#13;
that can be used for international comparison of intertemporal&#13;
changes of poverty. We have, therefore, no option but to look,_-,&#13;
at other indicators. In particular, the indicators that&#13;
figure most often in "physical quality of life" indices may&#13;
be chosen for this purpose, and they are longevity and literacy.8&#13;
8 Morris (1979) chooses infant mortality up to age 1 as an&#13;
additional parameter, and correspondingly measures longevity&#13;
in terms of expectation of life at age 1. Expectation of life&#13;
at birth combines the two.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Table 3 presents data for 100 countries with GNP per&#13;
capita less than $3,000 in 1977 as given by the World&#13;
Development Report 1979. Indeed these are all the countries&#13;
for which data are given and which have income below the&#13;
specified limit.9   Estimates of expectation of life at&#13;
birth and of adult literacy rates are given for 1960 and&#13;
1977, taken from the World Development Report 1979.10&#13;
There is an interesting issue as to how best to&#13;
calculate the magnitude of change. Should it be the size of&#13;
absolute change in either of these magnitudes, or relati've&#13;
change in the form of percentage increase. The answer, on&#13;
reflection, is: neither! It can be argued that as, say,&#13;
longevity becomes high, it becomes more of an achievement&#13;
to raise it further. Raising the expectation of life from 25&#13;
to 35 may be easily achieved by cutting out epidemics, etc.,&#13;
but to raise it from 65 to 75 is quite another matter. And&#13;
to raise it from 70 to 80 has not yet been done by any country&#13;
whatsoever. Thus taking absolute magnitudes of change under-&#13;
estimates the performance of countries with already high&#13;
longevity.  And to lookc at percentage chanjges of the expectat-&#13;
ion of life introduces a change precisely in the wrong directiox&#13;
e.g., 65 to 75 is a smaller percentage change than 25 to 35.&#13;
So neither of these methods will do.&#13;
9 The World Development Report classifies countries not&#13;
merely on the basis of income, but also on other character-&#13;
istics. What has been done in Table 3 is to choose all&#13;
countries with GNP per capita less than $3,000 whether they&#13;
are placed by the World Development Report under "low&#13;
income countries", "middle income countries", "industrializec&#13;
countries", or "centrally planned economies".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
A better procedure is to look at the absolute short-&#13;
fall of actual longevity from some chosen upper bound, e.g., .&#13;
80, and then to examine the percentage decline of this short-&#13;
fall. This is the method that has been used in Table 3 to&#13;
calculate change in both longevity as well as literacy.&#13;
For longevity the upper bound is taken to be, the unachieved&#13;
(and arguably unachievable) 80 years, while for literacy,&#13;
a figure of 100 per cent provides a natural upper bound.11&#13;
In the last column of Table 3 distinguished perfSrmances&#13;
have been noted. For each of the two success variables (viz.,&#13;
percentage decline in longevity shortfall, and percentage&#13;
decline in literacy shortfall), the countries with four&#13;
best performances have been put in category A, and countries&#13;
in the top quarter (25 per cent) of each list have been&#13;
awarded B (if not already a recepient of A). The others all&#13;
get C, but this has been written up only in those cases in&#13;
which a country has scored A or B on one variable, but C in&#13;
the other. (That is, all blanks in the last column either&#13;
reflect C or unknown data.) While longevity data have been&#13;
10 In some cases the figures refer not exactly to 1960 or&#13;
1977, but to a neighbouring year. This applies to the&#13;
set of literacy figures only, which also has some gaps,&#13;
viz., countries for which data could not be found for&#13;
1966 (or its neighbouring years) or for 1977 (or its&#13;
neighbouring years).&#13;
11 For longevity there is no natural maximum. The current&#13;
best performance is 76 years. By choosing 80 as the&#13;
upper bound, we have added four years to that, which&#13;
is certainly most unlikely to be achieved in the absence&#13;
of some remarkable medical breakthrough. One result of&#13;
choosing 80 years as the upper bound is to make the&#13;
maximum percentage rise from an increase in one year in&#13;
longevity to be no more than 25 per cent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
found for all the countries, the literacy data refer to 61&#13;
countries (out of the 100) for which the World Development&#13;
Report 1979 provides information for both 1960 and 1977.&#13;
Thus while 25 countries have got A or B on the first score&#13;
(longevity), only 16 countries have been awarded these marks&#13;
in the second (literacy), with the last two tying for the&#13;
fifteenth position. For those countries which score A or&#13;
B under longevity but for which literacy data have not Meen&#13;
presented, a question mark ? has been put as the second&#13;
score.&#13;
What kind of an over-all picture emerge from this?&#13;
The best performances are the following:&#13;
Longevity                  Literacy&#13;
1.  Vietnam                1.  South Korea&#13;
2.  Cuba                   2.  Hong Kong&#13;
3.  Taiwan                 3.  Tanzania&#13;
4.  Hong Kong              4.  Taiwan.&#13;
38 countries have shown distinction (A or B) in&#13;
one or both of the fields.   It should be noted that since&#13;
literacy data were not available for 39 countries, this&#13;
is biased against them, since they had the chance of&#13;
showing distinction only in one field of the two.&#13;

What can we say about this list? One thought that&#13;
is bound to occur is that communism is good for poverty&#13;
removal.   There are 10 communist countries in the total&#13;
list of 100,. and of them 9 show some dis,tinction (i.e.,.'. .:&#13;
qualify in the list of 38 in Table 4).     In fact, 8 of&#13;
the 9 (all except Yugoslavia) do this despite not having&#13;
literacy figures reported in Table 3, i.e., they do it on&#13;
the basis of one entry alone. That entry, of course, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
longevity, which is arguably a more basic indicator of&#13;
success than literacy.12&#13;
As against this, it should also be noted that many of&#13;
the communist countries are, in fact, richer than the mean&#13;
or median developing country, and while the indices are&#13;
relative ones, it may be argued that richer countries demon-&#13;
strably do better, on the whole, in the comparisons made&#13;
in Table 3. On the other hand, it is easily checked that&#13;
even among comparable countries in terms of GNP per head,&#13;
the longevity performance of the communist countries is&#13;
typically superior. This applies to the poorer group also.&#13;
For example, if we look at countries with GNP per head less&#13;
than $1,000, the following is the breakdown of communist and&#13;
non-communist countries in terms of longevity performance.&#13;

12 The educational performance of communist countries,&#13;
especially in generating literacy, is also typically&#13;
good, as is clear from other sources of evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Clearly the relative performance of communist countries&#13;
is superior in terms of this particular indicator.     The&#13;
other indicator, viz., literacy performance, cannot be used&#13;
as a basis for comparison, since the data for this variable&#13;
are not presented for most of the communist countries in the&#13;
World Development Report 1979, which has been used as our&#13;
basis for comparison.&#13;
A second point to note is that some of the high-growth&#13;
early capitalist countries (e.g., Taiwan, S. Korea, Hong Kong&#13;
and Singapore) also have very good performance in terms of&#13;
the chosen indicators. Indeed, Taiwan and Hong Kong have&#13;
the best over-all performance record in terms of the two&#13;
criteria for those 61 countries for which both sets of data&#13;
are available. The countries that seem to do relatively&#13;
worse are those in the middle, neither communist, nor&#13;
successfully capitalist. Even here there are clear exceptions,&#13;
and we have already pointed towards Sri Lanka and Tanzania as&#13;
interesting cases of relative success in terms of poverty&#13;
removaLl and longevity (Sri Lanka) and expansion of literacy&#13;
(Tanzania).&#13;
One does not., however, learn very much about causation&#13;
at this remote level of inter-country comparisons, and it will&#13;
be useful to go into the details for a number of chosen cases.&#13;
13  Vietnam has been put in the communist list, but even if&#13;
it is transferred to the non-communist group on grounds&#13;
of the nature of the south Vietnamese polity preceding&#13;
unification, the over-all picture will not change much.&#13;
Note also that the performance of the communist countries&#13;
is superior not only in terms of the percentage decline&#13;
in the longevity shortfall used as the basis for&#13;
comparison in this study, but also in terms of the&#13;
absolute level of longevity achieved (see Table 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
One group that requires attention is clearly the successful&#13;
early capitalist countries, in particular the Asian foursome:&#13;
S. Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Among them the&#13;
former two are more interesting to study, both because they&#13;
are poorer (Singpore, it better be remembered, is richer&#13;
than Ireland), and also because they are larger and not&#13;
city states. South Korea in particular requires special&#13;
attention since its growth rate has gone up recently quite&#13;
sharply along with good performance in non-growth indicators,&#13;
and it has been seen as something of a model for other develop-&#13;
ing countries.&#13;
The second group that deserves attention are Sri Lanka&#13;
and Tanzania in terms of their superior performance, especially&#13;
remarkable since they are among the poorer countries even in&#13;
the list of developing economies. Insofar as removal of&#13;
poverty and expansion of longevity are taken to be more&#13;
important indicators of success than expansion of literacy,&#13;
Sri Lanka's case deserves special attention.&#13;
In the next two sections (4 and 5) these two groups&#13;
are considered in turn. After that we return to more general&#13;
analysis again on a wider canvas, and also go into the tricky&#13;
methodological issue as to what "level" of explanation to&#13;
use in drawing lessons from cases of success in the comparative&#13;
14&#13;
picture.    Then we study some cases of "failure"&#13;
14 The communist countries deserve special study too in view&#13;
of their superior performance, but there is already quite&#13;
a literature on this.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(in particular, Bangladesh and Ethiopia) focusing particularly&#13;
on the extreme form-.of poverty that takes the shape of starv-&#13;
ation and famines and draw some lessons from that. The main&#13;
conclusions are gathered together in the final section.&#13;
4.     Growth, Private Enterprise and Public Policy: Case Studies&#13;
The excellent performance of Taiwan, Hong Kong,&#13;
South Korea and Singapore was noted earlier, and as Ian Little&#13;
(1979b) puts it, "there is a good reason to ask what can be&#13;
learned from ... the four" (p.1). The possibility of emulation&#13;
has been explicitly raised,15 and Little himself has stated&#13;
the central issue clearly:&#13;
"Except for Hong Kong, very rapid growth began only&#13;
in the sixties, in each case after a marked change&#13;
of policy from import substitution to export promotion.&#13;
It will be the thesis of the paper that the success is&#13;
almost entirely due to good policies and the ability&#13;
of the people - scarcely at all to favourable circum-&#13;
stances or a good start." 16&#13;
It is worth clarifying that while Hong Kong is treated as&#13;
something of an exception in this statement, this is only&#13;
because it had a policy of export promotion anyway even&#13;
before the sixties, and it is also to be noted that Hong Kong's&#13;
over-all growth performance,has been very gooed for,,-a long time.&#13;
The restrictive trade pattern of preceding years appears on&#13;
15  See particularly Chenery and Keesing (1978), Rao (1978), Westphal&#13;
(1978), Little (1979b), and Krueger (1979).&#13;
16 Little (1979b, p.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
this view to have been abandoned with great advantage in&#13;
those countries which had such restrictions.&#13;
What makes the experience of high growth in these&#13;
countries particularly worthy of attention is the so-called&#13;
"quality" of that growth, viz., that it seems to have taken&#13;
place without accentuation of inequality (as is often,&#13;
sadly, the case), and there is evidence of fast removal of&#13;
poverty in these countries judged from each of the perspectives&#13;
that have been used in the analysis above.   Questions have&#13;
been raised about the nature of the data used, especially&#13;
for South Korea, and it has been particularly disputed that&#13;
in the seventies - the period of rapid growth in Korea - there&#13;
17&#13;
has been no accentuation of inequality.     What is not, however,&#13;
disputed is that these countries have acheived very high growth&#13;
rates with at least no sharp deterioration of the extent of&#13;
inequality, so that the poorer sections of the population&#13;
have shared substantially in the benefits of economic growth.&#13;
What is also not in dispute is the fact that the growth&#13;
in these countries has been accompanied by a remarkable rate&#13;
of expansion of exports in general, and of manufacturing&#13;
exports in particular. For example, during 1965-75, the&#13;
Korean exports increased at an annual rate of 31 per cent&#13;
per year at constant 1970 prices. "The major lesson," Little&#13;
17 See Choo (1975, 1978), Choo and Kim (1978), and Bhalla&#13;
(1979). Bhalla's estimation suggests a decline in&#13;
the share of bottom 20 per cent in national income from&#13;
6.5 per cent in 1970 to 5.2 per cent in 1976, along&#13;
with a decline of the share of the bottom 40 per cent&#13;
from 18.0 per cent to 15.4 per cent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
(1979b) concludes, "is the labour-intensive export-oriented&#13;
policies, which amounted to almost free trade conditions&#13;
for exporters, were the prime cause of an extremely rapid&#13;
and labour-intensive industrialization which revolutionized&#13;
in a decade the lives of more than fifty million people,&#13;
including the poorest among them" (p.34).&#13;
There is indeed much in the experience of "the four"&#13;
to cheer Adam Smith, and the invisible hand would seem to&#13;
have done a good deal of visible good. But is this really&#13;
the "major lesson" to draw from the experiences of the four?&#13;
I would now like to argue that perhaps it is not.&#13;
First a preliminary point about the four. Two of them&#13;
are very tiny: the combined population of Hong Kong and&#13;
Singapore is exceeded by the population of many cities, e.g.,&#13;
Shanghai, or Tokyo, or even greater Calcutta, and they also&#13;
occupy rather little land mass. Hong Kong and Singapore are&#13;
also very rich, compared with the typical developing countries.&#13;
On both these grounds it would make sense to pay more attention&#13;
to tha experiences of South Korea and Taiwan. Especially&#13;
South Korea, since it is a fairly large country (in Lerms&#13;
of population size it is comparable to Egypt, more than twice&#13;
the size of Taiwan), and also the poorest of the four (and&#13;
had been,in fact, poorer than Egypt in the 1950s).&#13;
How invisible were the hands that the reared South&#13;
Korean economic expansion? Not much, it would appear. First,&#13;
while the massive export promotion was going on, the Korean&#13;
government was carrying out quite a strong programme of&#13;
import substitution in selected areas. As Mrinal Datta-Chaudhuri&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(1979) notes: "In 1960, chemical fertilizers, synthetic fibre&#13;
yarns and thread, petroleum products, paper, cement, iron&#13;
and steel products and plastic materials were some of the&#13;
principal items in Korea's import trade", while "by 1971,&#13;
import substitution eliminated all these items except synthetic&#13;
fibre yarns and plastic materials from the list of major&#13;
-importables" (p.23). In 1970, out of the 1312 basic items,&#13;
the import of 73 items was banned, and that of 524 restricted.18&#13;
Even in 1976, 60 items were on the prohibited list and another&#13;
616 items on the restricted list. While the numbers of&#13;
prohibited and restricted items provide very crude quantificat-&#13;
ion of import restriction, the over-all picture to emerge is&#13;
certainly very far from one of free trade. There seems to&#13;
be also some evidence for the view that fostered import&#13;
substitution in Korea prepared the ground for eventual export&#13;
19&#13;
expansion.     Indeed, even in export expansion itself, the&#13;
invisible hand was buttressed by various incentives, including&#13;
"merit medals".&#13;
Within the country the Korean government had overwhelming&#13;
control of the organised banking sector, owning not only the&#13;
central bank, but also the five nation-wide commercial banks,&#13;
in addition to the specialized banks and financial institutions&#13;
(e.g., Korea Development Bank, the Medium Industries Bank, the&#13;
Korea Exchange Bank, etc.). It carried out a policy of&#13;
18 See Frank, Kim and Westphal (1975).&#13;
19 See Datta-Chaudhuri (1979, pp.24-5). See also Erank, Kim&#13;
and Westphal (1975), Hong and Krueger (1975), Kim (1977a,&#13;
1977b), and Krueger (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
spectacular encouragement to private savings through high&#13;
return on bank.deposits. This was combined with an already&#13;
high tax base being expanded, and public enterprises generat-&#13;
ing further resources at the disposal of the government. The&#13;
speeding of the Korean economic development during 1964 to&#13;
1970 was accompanied by an increase in government saving of&#13;
20.6 per cent per year, and by 1970 government savings&#13;
accounted for 43 per cent of total domestic savings. Adding&#13;
government savings to deposits in nationalized banks, it&#13;
appears that the government controlled two-thirds of invest-&#13;
ment resources in the economy. As Datta-Chaudhuri (1979)&#13;
puts it, "no state, outside the socialist bloc, ever came&#13;
anywhere near this measure of control over the economy's&#13;
investable resources" (p.16).&#13;
The government has not been a passive channel for these&#13;
investment funds. On the contrary, it used its power to&#13;
control the direction of investment through various means,&#13;
including varying the interest rate charged with the field&#13;
of invrestment (e.g., 8 to 33 per cent depending on the field).&#13;
The public sector itself absorbed nearly a third of the total&#13;
investment during 1963-72, growing at 14.5 per cent per annum,&#13;
compared with the economy's over-all growth rate of 9.5 per&#13;
cent. In addition to including the traditional fields of&#13;
railways, communication and electricity, the public sector&#13;
in South Korea covers many industrial units, producing 15&#13;
per cent of the manufacturing output and owning a larger&#13;
share of industrial capital (since the public sector industries&#13;
are typically more capital-intensive).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
It is not clear how cheered Adam Smith would have&#13;
been with the South Korean experience. It is, in fact, a&#13;
classic case of the government playing an active part in&#13;
industrialization and growth. The fact that export expansion&#13;
provided a very good vehicle for such expansion must not be&#13;
denied, but it has to be viewed in the perspective of the&#13;
total economic picture in South Korea. Indeed, in many&#13;
ways the Korean experience has been fully in line with the&#13;
traditional wisdom of development economics, exemplified by&#13;
the writings of Nurkse (1953) and Lewis (1955), and even&#13;
Fei   and Ranis(1964).  A labour-abundant economy embarked on&#13;
a fast economic growth with a corresponding increase in&#13;
employment and a remarkable acceleration of capital accumulat-&#13;
ion. °  The ratio of gross domestic investment to GDP rose&#13;
from 11 per cent in 1961 to 26 per cent in 1976, and during&#13;
the sixties the South Korean rate of growth of domestic&#13;
investment (23 per cent per year) was higher than that of&#13;
any other country for which the World Development Report 1979&#13;
provides data (see Table 4, which gives these data for 95&#13;
countries).  The governrment played a major part in the&#13;
generation and use of these investment funds.&#13;
What made the fruits of Korean growth spread so widely&#13;
was clearly the fast expansion of employment and eventually&#13;
also of real wages, which went with this growth.21   There can&#13;
20 The capital accumulation was certainly helped initially&#13;
by external capital inflow, and continued to be important (see&#13;
(Krueger (1979)).       Also the low value of capital&#13;
output ratio,related to the investment pattern and use&#13;
of labour and skill,made the accumulation of capital&#13;
unusually effective.&#13;
21 See Hong and Krueger (197T), especially Cole and Wiestphal (1975),&#13;
Adelman and Robinson (1978), Westphal (1978), Little (1979b),&#13;
and Krueger (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
be little doubt that the labour-intensive nature of the&#13;
growth was central to Korean success in poverty reduction.&#13;
In understanding the Korean experience, the role of employment&#13;
expansion and growing demand for labour belongs to the most&#13;
immediate level of explanation. Behind that immediate&#13;
explanation stand several other factors causally linked to&#13;
it in the Korean case, and these include rapid capital&#13;
accumulation, reliance on export expansion, availability of&#13;
a labour force suited by education to modern manufactures,&#13;
etc. The merits of export-led growth proved to be substantial&#13;
for the Korean economy in the particular circumstances in which&#13;
it found itself, and as Adelman and Robinson (1978) demonstrate,&#13;
"the strategy of labour-intensive export led growth has&#13;
produced significantly higher incomes for the poorer half&#13;
of the population and a far more equal relative distribution&#13;
compared with a strategy of import substitution" (p.127).&#13;
But this belongs to a remoter level of explanation. Even&#13;
if a country is shown to be not in a position to emulate the&#13;
Korea:i export-expansion success, the imTiediate  lesson of the&#13;
importance of employment expansion would still stand, and&#13;
any set of policies - whether export-expansive or import-&#13;
substituting - which can be shown to have these employmaent&#13;
characteristics would be supported by the Korean experience.&#13;
This methodological question will-be further taken up in&#13;
section 6, but a few more points should be noted on the&#13;
specifics of the Korean case.&#13;
The growth of employment related to exports has been&#13;
extraordinarily rapid in South Korea.   During 1960-70 the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
volume of direct employment in export production increased&#13;
at the astonishing rate of 34 percent per year, and total&#13;
export-induced employment - both direct and indirect taken&#13;
together - also at the very high rate of 30 percent per year.22&#13;
The value of capital-output ratio fell sharply, and even&#13;
the capital-labour ratio showed substantial decline, in the&#13;
manufacturing sector of the economy, and these declines&#13;
were helped by the export-orientation of production in this&#13;
sector. 3   But despite that, the size of export-related&#13;
employment has remained a small fraction of the total employ-&#13;
ment in the Korean economy, and a good deal less than half&#13;
even of manufacturing employment.      The point of mentioning&#13;
this is not to belittle the remarkable achievements of the&#13;
Korean export-expansion programme, but to note that there is a&#13;
good deal more in the Korean experience than this one feature&#13;
which seems to have received more attention than any other.&#13;
The fuller picture is that the South Korean economy was&#13;
experiencing a remarkably fast economic growth with a massive&#13;
capital accumulation, which was being invested in very labour-&#13;
intensive ways, and the most dynamic part of the growing economy&#13;
was undoubtedly the export sector.&#13;
Turning now to Taiwan, its experience also demonstrates&#13;
2Q See Cole and Westphal (1975).&#13;
23  See, among others, Cole and Westphal (1978), Adelman&#13;
and Robinson (1978), and Westphal (1978).&#13;
24 In 1970 direct employment in production for exports&#13;
seems to have been about 18.9 percent of manufacturing&#13;
employment and 5.1 percent of total employment. Adding&#13;
indirect employment due to exports would increase these&#13;
figures by a little more than a half. See Little (1979b, p.31)&#13;
and Hsia (1979, pp.30-1). The data used come from Cole&#13;
and Westphal (1975) and Westphal (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
the great importance of employment expansion in poverty&#13;
removal.. The proportion of visible unemployment fell from&#13;
6.3 per cent of the labour force in 1953 to 3.7 per cent in&#13;
1975.25  But perhaps more importantly, hidden unemployment&#13;
and underemployment showed sharp decline in terms of the&#13;
change of their usual habitat (see particularly Galenson 1979,&#13;
pp.404-7)). For example, unpaid family workers fell from&#13;
being 28.5 per cent of total employment in 1964 to 15.9 per&#13;
cent in 1975. 6 It is the expansion of employment at a&#13;
reasonable wage that has permitted the poorer Taiwanese "to&#13;
feed, clothe, and house his family and send his children to&#13;
school" and to enjoy a steady increase in "the availability&#13;
of consumer goods". 27&#13;
At a remoter level of explanation, the successful&#13;
expansion of exports has certainly been a major factor behind&#13;
this employment-led prosperity. There is evidence that the&#13;
export industries provided greater scope for labour utilisation&#13;
than the manufacturing sector in general, and the existing&#13;
import-replacing industries in particular. 8 There has also&#13;
been massive capital accumulation, with a slightly higher&#13;
percentage invested than even in South Korea (though the&#13;
proportionate rate of growth has not been so fast, since it&#13;
was substantially higher than in Korea in 1960). In both these&#13;
25 See Kuo (1976). See also Hsia and Chao (1978).&#13;
26 See Galenson (1979, p.406).&#13;
27 Galenson (1979, p.447). Also Hsia and Chao (1978).&#13;
28 See Little (1979a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
respects the Taiwanese experience is rather similar to the&#13;
Korean. And as far as the role of government is concerned,&#13;
there is clear evidence of the importance of government's&#13;
policy measures in determining the character of economic&#13;
development in Taiwan, especially the promotion of exports.29&#13;
Even though the government did not have the kind of overwhelming&#13;
command that was enjoyed in South Korea, it did have a good&#13;
deal of power and used that to promote actively its chosen&#13;
pattern of economic expansion.&#13;
5.      Distribution, Social Services and Public Policy: Case&#13;
Studies&#13;
As was noted earlier, in poverty removal and in expand-&#13;
ing longevity Sri Lanka's record has been distinguished. While&#13;
the absence of later literacy data prevented comparison with&#13;
other countries on that score, its level of literacy is indeed&#13;
high. By 1973 the proportion of adult literacy was already&#13;
78 per cent in Sr. Lanka, more than twice the figure for&#13;
neighbouring India, and more than three and a half times the&#13;
figures for Pakistan and Bangladesh.&#13;
It can be checked that in terms of relation with per&#13;
capita GNP, Sri Lanka's actual values of (i) life expectancy,&#13;
(ii) adult literacy, (iii) infant mortality, and (iv) fertility,&#13;
all lie comfortably away from their expected values (in the&#13;
right direction, i.e., higher for the first two, lower for&#13;
the last two).30 For a poor country, with incomes comparable&#13;
29 See Scott (1979, pp.336-345).&#13;
30 See Isenman (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
(only a little higher) than India or Pakistan, Sri Lanka's&#13;
record in removing poverty and providing a higher quality of&#13;
life is quite remarkable.&#13;
Regarding the causation of this superior performance,&#13;
attention has tended to concentrate on Sri Lanka's programme&#13;
of food subsidy and other social services. There is clear&#13;
evidence that this programme reduces the concentration of&#13;
income distribution quite significantly.31   Food subsidies&#13;
also have the effect of improving nutrition of the poorer&#13;
section of the population. This is partly because it is an&#13;
income supplement, but also because offering income supplement&#13;
in the form of food does typically have the effect of increasing&#13;
food consumption rather more than the same amount offered&#13;
32&#13;
through direct income grant.     There is also some evidence&#13;
that the cut-back in the food subsidy programme in 1973 was&#13;
followed by an increase in the death rate in Sri Lanka in 1974.33&#13;
While the important role of the food distribution&#13;
programme in Sri Lanka is undeniable, it seems appropriate to&#13;
view it as one part of the actively redistributive orientation&#13;
of government policy in Sri Lanka. The health programme is&#13;
also efficient and ehergetic. While there remain inequalities&#13;
31 See Jayawardena (1974), and Alailima (1978).&#13;
32 There is much evidence for the greater impact of income&#13;
,subsidy when given in the form of food, on the actual&#13;
consumption of food, and this effect has been particularly&#13;
studied in the case of Kerala state in India; see United&#13;
Nations (1975), Kumar (1979) and George (1979). One would&#13;
expect such an effect on theoretical grounds as well, since&#13;
the subsidy on food changes relative prices adding a sub-&#13;
stitution effect to the income effect, and also because&#13;
transaction costs would push the consumer further in that&#13;
direction.&#13;
33 See Isenman (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
in the coverage in terms of region and class,34 there is&#13;
little doubt that Sri Lanka achieves a widespread health&#13;
coverage of a kind that is quite rare among developing&#13;
countries.35  It is also interesting to observe that the&#13;
proportion of GDP devoted to health expenditure in Sri Lanka&#13;
is not exceptionally high, and indeed many developing countries&#13;
with much worse performance in health spend a higher proportion&#13;
of GDP on this item.36  Given the relatively low per capita&#13;
income level of Sri Lanka, the contrast is all the more impressive.&#13;
The important difference seems to be brought about by the&#13;
orientation of government policy in Sri Lanka, with its emphasis&#13;
on securing a comparatively wide coverage, and being more active&#13;
in trying to reach the poorer sections of the community. The&#13;
food distribution programme is best seen as a part of this&#13;
general approach.&#13;
The same applies to Sri Lanka's education programmes.&#13;
The educational facilities of Sri Lanka have been widely&#13;
distributed, and are responsible for its rather superior&#13;
performance. While Sri Lanka's poverty level measured in terms&#13;
of income is also rather lower than that of countries with&#13;
comparable income per head, its performance is very substantially&#13;
more distinguished when judged in terms of results such as&#13;
longevity, literacy, etc. (see Tables 1 and 3 above). Behind&#13;
these achievements lie active government policies providing&#13;
34 See Viasaria (1979) and Richards and Gooneratne (1980).&#13;
35 See Alailima (1978), Isenman (1980), Visaria (1979), and&#13;
Richards and Gooneratne (1980).&#13;
36 See Richards and Gooneratne (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
concrete services with an orientation towards wide distribution.&#13;
Inequalities in income distribution are, thus, significantly&#13;
37&#13;
reduced by direct public provisions.&#13;
The question has been frequently asked whether a poor&#13;
country like Sri Lanka can afford to have such a high volume&#13;
of social welfare expenditure, and it has also been argued&#13;
that its growth rate may have been negatively influenced by&#13;
the allocation of resources to these programmes. These&#13;
"counter-factual" hypotheses are rather difficult to assess.&#13;
There is, of course, the simple fact that the annual rate&#13;
of growth of GNP per head in Sri Lanka for the period 1960-77&#13;
has been only 2 per cent, and in the seventies in particular&#13;
it has been much less than that. But the question is whether&#13;
the growth rate would have been much higher in the absence of&#13;
these programmes.&#13;
It can, of course, be argued that the rate of investment&#13;
in the economy very likely would have been higher if these&#13;
programmes were abandoned, since they absorb more than 10&#13;
per cont of GNP.38   It is also true that Sri Lanka's rate of&#13;
domestic investment is lower than that of neighbouring Pakistan&#13;
and India, and also -lower than the average for developing&#13;
countries and even for "low-income" developing countries.39&#13;
37 See Jayawardena (1974), Alailima (1978), and Richards and.&#13;
Gooneratne (1980).&#13;
38 In 1973 these programmes absorbed about 11% of GNP (see&#13;
Alailima (1978, p.46)). This figure does, however, include&#13;
the entire educational budget, some of which must be seen&#13;
to be something other than social welfare expenditure.&#13;
39 See Table 5 of the World Development Report 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
It must, however, be noted that Sri Lanka's ratio of gross&#13;
domestic savings (as opposed to investment) is comparable&#13;
to that of the average of low income developing countries,&#13;
and a bit lower than in India and rather substantially higher&#13;
than in Pakistan. The comparatively low value of Sri Lanka's&#13;
investment ratio seems to be due to less foreign aid and&#13;
investment.&#13;
Furthermore, nutrition does contribute to productivity,&#13;
as several studies have shown, and the impact of literacy on&#13;
growth - especially agricultural growth - has been noted.40&#13;
In fact, Sri Lanka's rate of expansion of agricultural production&#13;
has been good, and remarkably enough, so far as food is concerned,&#13;
the rise of 13 per cent in availability per capita over the&#13;
period 1969-71 to 1975-77 experienced by Sri Lanka in unequalled&#13;
by any country with a GNP per head below $600 (in 1977 U.S.&#13;
dollars). There are 54 countries in that income bracket, with&#13;
Sri Lanka coming more than half way down, and its comparative&#13;
performance in the expansion of food output must be regarded&#13;
as exceptionally good.&#13;
There is little doubt that the social welfare programmes&#13;
of Sri Lanka place it at an advantaged position in terms of&#13;
poverty removal and longevity increase given its income level.&#13;
In the context of assessing growth-based vis-a-vis welfare-&#13;
based strategy, it might be useful to measure that advantage&#13;
in terms of years of lead for appropriate rates of growth.&#13;
The methodology used is, first, to convert the life expect-&#13;
ation and poverty-head-count advantages into income advantages&#13;
in terms of the general cross country relation holding around&#13;
40 Cf. Sen (1970) and Chaudhri (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
the world, and then to convert the income advantages into&#13;
the corresponding measures of years of lead at the appropriate&#13;
growth rates.&#13;
Isenman (1980) has obtained the following power curve&#13;
fit for life expectancy on per capita income:41&#13;
(1)    Ln(life expectancy)  =  3.263 + 0.123 Ln(per capita income),&#13;
using 1975 data for 59 countries. From this, it is easily&#13;
calculated that the income per capita corresponding to Sri&#13;
Lanka's life expectancy of 69 years is $2,684 as opposed to&#13;
its actual income of $130 in 1975 U.S. dollars. Thus the per&#13;
capita income of Sri Lanka would have to be raised by a factor&#13;
of 20.65 for it to have its actual life expectancy as its&#13;
expected life expectancy based on income.&#13;
There is no corresponding calculation for percentage&#13;
of population below the poverty line. But this is easily&#13;
done by using Table 1. Two fits were tried out, respectively&#13;
linear y = a + bx, and power curve y = p xr, and the results&#13;
are the following:42&#13;
(2)    head-count-poverty ratio  =  60.92 - 0.04409 Kravis-adjusted-GNP;&#13;
(3)    In(head-count-poverty-ratio)  =  10.396 - 1.137356 Ln(kravis-adjusted-GN&#13;
The Kravis-adjusted-income levels at which Sri Lanka's head-&#13;
count-poverty ratio of 14 per cent is reached are respectively&#13;
$1064 and $916ivis-a-vis Sri Lanka's ,actual Kravis-adjusted-&#13;
income level of $471. Thus, the income level of Sri Lanka would&#13;
41 See Isenman (1980) for the details of the fit. The value of&#13;
r2, incidentally, is .65.&#13;
2&#13;
42  The values of r  for the two fits are respectively .75 and&#13;
.83, and the number of observations is 33, since Sri Lanka&#13;
was not included in doing the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
have to be raised, on this approach, by factors of 2.26 and&#13;
1.94 respectively for achieving poverty removal through income&#13;
growth.&#13;
I turn now to the growth assumptions. The Sri Lankan&#13;
growth rate of GNP per capita over 1960-77 has been 2.0 per&#13;
cent per year. In the absence of the social welfare programme&#13;
what kind of a growth rate would Sri Lanka have had? This&#13;
is, of course, a terribly speculative counter-factual question,&#13;
but there would be very little causal economic analysis if&#13;
such speculations were to be entirely shunned. Perhaps the&#13;
most favourable assumption is one in which all of the 11 per&#13;
cent of expenditure on social services are put instead into&#13;
gross domestic investment, increasing the latter by the same&#13;
amount, and enhancing the growth rate of per capita income by&#13;
a rate determined by the marginal capital-output ratio. The&#13;
gross domestic product in Sri Lanka increased at 4.6% and 3.1%&#13;
respectively over 1961-70 and 1970-76, with 15 and 17 per cent&#13;
43&#13;
of GDP invested in 1961 and 1976 respectively.      With a slight&#13;
liberty, these figures yield values of marginal capital output&#13;
ratio of 3.26 and 5.47 respectively, and with an 11% of GDP&#13;
added to investment, the growth rates would be raised by 3.37%&#13;
and 2.01% respectively. Added to the prevailing growth rate&#13;
of 2 per cent per annum (overlooking the niceties of the&#13;
distinction between GNP growth rate and GDP growth rate),&#13;
43  See World Development Review 1979, Tables 2 ard 5.    Regarding&#13;
investment ratios, one should have used not the end-year&#13;
ratios but the ratios for the whole period, which were not,&#13;
however, readily available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
we obtain enhanced values of growth rates of GNP per capita&#13;
of 5.37% and 4.01% respectively.&#13;
The least favourable assumption would appear to be an&#13;
unchanged growth rate as social welfare programmes are eschewed.44&#13;
In Table 6 the years taken to match non-income factors behind&#13;
poverty removal and longevity enhancement by income growth&#13;
are presented with alternative assumptions about growth performance.&#13;

The over-all impression is one of a long haul in match-&#13;
ing social welfare achievements of Sri Lanka with income growth.&#13;
44  Note, in this context, that Sri Lanka's ratio of gross&#13;
domestic savings is rather similar to the average of&#13;
the "low income" developing countries, viz., 11% in 1961&#13;
(compared with a "low income" average of 11%), and 20%&#13;
in 1976 (compared with a "low income" average of 18%).&#13;
It is, thus, by no means obvious that imitation of&#13;
countries with less social welfare programmes would&#13;
raise Sri Lanka''s savings rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
In fact, these hauls must be rather longer if it is recognized&#13;
that the assumptions - even the "unfavourable" one of no&#13;
change - may prove to be too optimistic for the growth strategy.&#13;
There are several distinct reasons for this.&#13;
(1) The existing growth rate of 2% per year in per&#13;
capita GNP is based on the actual growth rate of population&#13;
in Sri Lanka, but this is lower than in other countries in&#13;
the region, to a great extent due to the fertility decline&#13;
in Sri Lanka, which has been, with reason, related to the&#13;
45&#13;
social welfare programme.     Thus "no change" in total growth&#13;
rate might mean a lower growth rate of per capita income,&#13;
had the social welfare programme been eschewed.&#13;
(2) Cutting out social welfare programmes would not&#13;
really add as much as 11% of GNP to investment, since this&#13;
11% reflects the government's total expenditure on these&#13;
services, including the entire education and health budgets,&#13;
which could hardly be reduced to zero!&#13;
(3) While it is appropriate to consider the favourable&#13;
effects on growth rate of an increase in investment in physical&#13;
capital, it would be absurd to claim that a reduction of&#13;
expenditure on health and education would have no unfavourable&#13;
effects on growth, but that is the assumption on which the&#13;
growth rates in Table 6 have been calculated.&#13;
(4) The capital-output ratio of Sri Lanka would tend&#13;
to rise at the margin if the rate of capital accumulation is&#13;
substantially raised (as envisaged in the last two rows of&#13;
Table 6). This would pull down the growth, and increase the&#13;
45 In 1970-77, Sri Lanka's population growth rate was 1.7 per&#13;
cent per year, compared with India's 2.1%, Bangladesh's&#13;
9 R%  Ana PAki .anl's5  3.1%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
measure of advantage in terms of years.&#13;
(5) Several of the countries in the cross-country&#13;
fits have some social welfare programme, and the fits there-&#13;
forereflect the relation between income and poverty, or&#13;
income and longevity, not in the absence of social welfare&#13;
programmes, but in the presence of social welfare programmes&#13;
as they actually exist in the countries covered. By removing&#13;
all social welfare programmes through reduction of the 11%&#13;
allocation to 0%, Sri Lanka would not be joining the cross-&#13;
country lines of relationship, but would tend to go under&#13;
them.&#13;
On all these counts the estimated measures in terms of&#13;
years presented in Table 6 might understate the values of&#13;
Sri Lanka's social welfare achievements. While the impressive -&#13;
almost magical - powers of compound growth rates have been&#13;
frequently noted, it appears that such compounding may still&#13;
take quite a long time to catch up with the advantages of&#13;
social welfare achievements in Sri Lanka.&#13;
It is worth noting, in the context of assessing the&#13;
longevity and poverty-removal achievements of Sri Lanka,&#13;
that the per capita availability of food is not significantly&#13;
different in Sri Lanka compared with other low-income countries.46&#13;
Indeed, according to some estimates, the calorie per head and&#13;
the proportion of the average daily calorie requirement met&#13;
by average availability of food are virtually the same for&#13;
Sri Lanka as for the average of low income countries taken&#13;
46 See World Development Report 1979, page 168.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
together. 47 The relative absence of undernourishment and&#13;
the high longevity in Sri Lanka compared with conditions in&#13;
other poor countries would seem to be largely the result of&#13;
government's active policies, including food programmes&#13;
(substantially altering the way food gets allocated under&#13;
market forces)48 as well as other public facilities especially&#13;
health services. This is particularly important because of&#13;
49&#13;
the high level of unemployment ruling in the Sri Lankan economy,&#13;
and the low purchasing power of the poorer section of the non-&#13;
food growers, in particular estate labourers. The question of&#13;
food entitlements will be pursued further in section 7 in&#13;
the context of analysing starvation and famines in Ethiopia&#13;
and Bangladesh.&#13;
I turn now briefly to Tanzania's truly remarkable&#13;
achievement in the field of literacy. The raising of the&#13;
adult literacy rate from around 10 per cent in early sixties&#13;
to about 66 per cent by 1977 is a rather unique record. The&#13;
big push came around 1970 when the government announced a&#13;
national literacy programme to eradicate illiteracy by the&#13;
end of 1975. This did not quite happen, but by the summer of&#13;
47 World Development Report 1979, Table 22. For a different&#13;
assessment, see Richards and Gooneratne (1980, pp.10-11).&#13;
48 The food distribution arrangements have varied over the&#13;
years in Sri Lanka. In the early sixties 4 lbs were offered&#13;
per person per week at subsidized prices. In 1966 this was&#13;
replaced by offering 2 lbs per person per week completely&#13;
free, which was supplemented from 1970 by another 2 lbs at&#13;
subsidized prices. In 1973 both the free part and the sub-&#13;
sidized part were reduced, and the eligibility to get free&#13;
rice was restricted to non-income-tax payers, ie., the poorer&#13;
section.  Subsidized flour,   dal, etc., are also available,&#13;
supplementing the rice offer.&#13;
49 See Morawetz (1977, Table 11) for comparative data. However,&#13;
a substantial part of the Sri Lankan unemployed population&#13;
seems to be educated - very often coming from other than the&#13;
poorest section of the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
1975, 90 per cent of the estimated number of illiterates&#13;
were in fact enrolled. The "effective" literacy rate'jumped&#13;
from 33 per cent in 1967 to 59 per cent in 1975, and since&#13;
the 1967 criteria were known to have been less demanding than&#13;
in 1975,   the increase was close enough to an actual doubling&#13;
of the literacy rate in this short period. The Musoma Resolut-&#13;
ion in 1974 set the target of universal primary education by&#13;
November 1977, and the initiative of the preceding years was&#13;
consolidated into a decisive policy for basic primary education&#13;
for all Tanzanians.&#13;
A programme of this kind does, of course, require an&#13;
enormous allocation of resources. The main resource, in fact,&#13;
is that of teachers. here remarkably enough, the majority of&#13;
instructors for the adult literacy campaign were volunteers,&#13;
responding to the call for the removal of illiteracy. The&#13;
teachers' salaries did form a significant part-of the national&#13;
income, but given the magnitude of the task, 1.4 per cent of&#13;
GDP being absorbed this way, as was the case in mid-seventies,&#13;
can hardly be regarded as prohibitively expensive.&#13;
Like Sri Lanka's programme of social welfare, Tanzania's&#13;
literacy programme illustrates how much can be achieved by a&#13;
determined effort, sensibly directed towards specific goals.&#13;
If the Tanzanian educational pattern were to move along the&#13;
lines of cross-country fits, it would have to wait for a long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
time before rising income would make it "natural" for it to&#13;
have a high level of literacy and primary education. The&#13;
experiences of Sri Lanka and Tanzania illustrate the positive&#13;
role of state action, as did the Korean case, though in a&#13;
very different way. Strategies adopted by these economies&#13;
are quite different. What is common is the use of deliberate&#13;
and decisive public action.&#13;
It is perhaps also worth remarking in this context that&#13;
the experiences of Sri Lanka and Tanzania show that it is&#13;
possible for a dedicated government to have a substantial&#13;
impact on particular aspects of poverty and deprivation by&#13;
manipulating certain crucial levers on which it has control,&#13;
even when it does not have anything like the power that, say,&#13;
a fully socialist government would wish to have. Issues of&#13;
feasibility come up often enough in the context of the assessment&#13;
of what a government can or cannot do when it does not have&#13;
the kind of control with which their own philosophies have&#13;
been directly concerned. An example perhaps is the dilemma&#13;
faced by the communist government in West Bengal in India,&#13;
dedicated to a radical social transformation of a kind that&#13;
it is hardly in a position to carry out given the federal&#13;
political structure of India and its over-all fragile political&#13;
position.50 The experiences of Tanzania and Sri Lanka have some&#13;
50 While the party in power, viz., the Communist Party of&#13;
India (Marxist), has the distinction of not being a follower&#13;
of either of the two leading communist countries, viz.,&#13;
Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and is&#13;
commited to the Indian Parliamentary system, its ultimate&#13;
aim does, of course, remain the achievement of a classless&#13;
communist society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
clear relevance to the wisdom of the fundamentalist position&#13;
that "all or none" are the only viable alternatives. While&#13;
questions of long-run objectives and short-run political&#13;
survival may, with good reason,    overshadow this rather more&#13;
mundane issue, the issue nevertheless is clearly of some&#13;
importance to the strategy of policy making.&#13;
6.     Entitlements and Levels of Explanation&#13;
Each economic and political system produces a set of&#13;
entitlement relations governing who can have what in that&#13;
system (see Sen (1976b, 1977, 1980a, 1980b)). Ultimately&#13;
poverty removal is a matter of entitlement raising. There&#13;
are both aggregative and distributive influences on the&#13;
determination of entitlements, and while balanced growth might&#13;
work through the former, institutional arrangements affecting&#13;
the division of the cake work through the latter. The precise&#13;
characterization of entitlement relations will, of course,&#13;
vary with the nature of the economy and society (see Sen (1980b,&#13;
Chapters 1, 5-10, Appendices A and B)), but some distinguished&#13;
cases are easy to identify.&#13;
For a market economy, the determining variables of&#13;
entitlements can be broadly split into (i) ownership vector&#13;
(e.g., the land, capital or labour power which a person owns),&#13;
and (ii) exchange entitlement mapping (e.g., for each ownership&#13;
51 Cf. the experience of Allende's government in Chile. See,&#13;
however, Foxley, Aninat and Arellano (1979) for an assessment&#13;
of the important redistributive achievements of government&#13;
programmes in Chile during the period of 1964 to 1973, ending&#13;
up with the Allende years.&#13;

trade). The ownership vector for a particular group may&#13;
be enhanced either through over-all increase (e.g., capital&#13;
accumulation), or through asset redistribution (e.g., land&#13;
reform). These influences on entitlements through ownership&#13;
changes are rather more palpable and tend to be more often&#13;
discussed. Entitlement raising through improving the exchange&#13;
entitlement mapping is a bit more complex to analyse, but may&#13;
be no less important. It includes such diverse factors as,&#13;
say, guaranteeing better terms of trade for poor peasants,&#13;
or ensuring employment at a living wage, or providing social&#13;
security protections.&#13;
The method of removing poverty used in South Korea&#13;
and Taiwan, as was discussed, is one of guaranteeing employment&#13;
at a tolerable wage, and this has been possible by a very fast&#13;
expansion of these economies using labour-absorbing production&#13;
processes. In contrast, the level of unemployment in Sri Lanka&#13;
is high, and the wages, especially of estate workers, quite&#13;
low. There the guarantee of basic entitlements has not come&#13;
through the market, but outside it, in the form of a direct&#13;
right against the state, as was discussed in the last section.&#13;
The contrast is not, of course, a pure one. Some social&#13;
security provisionstdo exist in Taiwan, and to a lesser extent&#13;
in South Korea.52 Similarly, in Sri Lanka even the pre-tax&#13;
"gross" distribution of income is not as unequal as in some&#13;
developing countries.     But the crucial and distinctive features&#13;
52 See Galenson (1979) and Adelman and Robinson (1978).&#13;
53  See Jayawaraena (1974, p.273).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
of entitlement enhancement in the two types of economies are&#13;
different. In Taiwan and South Korea the social services&#13;
only rather marginally improve what is provided by a buoyant&#13;
labour market.    Sri Lanka's rather "middling" performance&#13;
in market-based entitlements is vastly improved by public&#13;
55&#13;
policy of distribution and social service.&#13;
More importantly, there is an important similarity&#13;
between the two strategies, which superficially might look&#13;
poles apart. Ultimately, poverty removal must come to grips&#13;
with the issue of entitlement guarantees. The two strategies&#13;
differ in the means of achieving this guarantee. While one&#13;
relies on the successfully fostered growth and the dynamism&#13;
of the encouraged labour market, the other gives the government&#13;
a more direct role as a provider of provisions. The similarities&#13;
can be seen more clearly if we look at the distributional pattern&#13;
through which these means work to guarantee entitlements.&#13;
It is not easy to obtain internationally comparable&#13;
income distribution data, but to get some broad idea Table 7&#13;
presents income distributional data for 16 countries taken&#13;
from the World Development Report 1979. (These are all the&#13;
countries with income per head less than $3,000 for which&#13;
such data are given.) The incomes in question are of "total&#13;
disposable household income", net of taxes. The World Develop-&#13;
ment Report 1979 gives the data in the,.form of shares of each&#13;
successive quintile. For ready comparison of parameters of&#13;

inequality, these have been presented here in the form of&#13;
cumulative aggregates, i.e., the shares of the bottom 20%,&#13;
bottom 40%, bottom 60% and bottom 80%, respectively.&#13;
The most satisfactory method of comparison with these&#13;
data is the so-called "Lorenz dominance". Country A Lorenz-&#13;
dominates country B in terms of equality of income distribution,&#13;
if compared with country B, country A has at least as high&#13;
an income share for each x% poorest population, and a strictly&#13;
higher share for some x% poorest population. When Lorenz&#13;
dominance holds between two distributions of incomd, many&#13;
interpretable conclusions can be drawn, and in general this&#13;
may be regarded as the most satisfactory method of comparing&#13;
the income distribution of two countries.     On the other&#13;
hand, this is a demanding criterion, and very often neither&#13;
country Lorenz-dominates the other in a pairwise comparison.&#13;
Lorenz domination yields a partial ordering of "clear"&#13;
rankings, but given its incompleteness, some less demanding&#13;
niethod of ranking has to be chosen to supplement Lorenz&#13;
comparison if completeness is sought. A simple method of&#13;
doing this - surprisingly little used in emnpirical comparisons&#13;
is to follow Borda's (1781) method of rank-order scoring, giving&#13;
points equal to the rank value of each country in each criterion&#13;
of comparative ranking. This produces a coimplete ordering&#13;
based on all the criteria taken together in terms of lowness..&#13;
of the sum of ranks (Borda scores).&#13;
Both the Lorenz and Borda methods of ranking the 16&#13;

countries in Table 7 have been' used, and the results are&#13;
represented in the form of two Hasse diagrams (with descending&#13;
lines representing superiority of the higher placed country&#13;
vis-a-vis the lower). The partial ordering of Lorenz dominance&#13;
given by Hasse diagram 1 is subsumed by the complete ordering&#13;
of Borda ranking in Hasse diagram 2. Interestingly enough,&#13;
the countries which were commended for their performance in&#13;
poverty removal and longevity extension come very much at&#13;
the top of these rankings.     Countries which were separated&#13;
out in section 2 for disappointing performance in terms of&#13;
poverty removal commensurate with their income, viz., Brazil,&#13;
Peru and Mexico, also figure here towards the bottom of the&#13;
.58'&#13;
two rankings.&#13;
Poverty removal and related features, including longevity&#13;
enhancement, is ultimately dependent on a wide distribution of&#13;
effective entitlements, and this - for any given level of per&#13;
capita income - would tend to be reflected in the low level&#13;
of inequality in the distribution of income. At this immediate&#13;
level of explanation, in terms of entitlements and income&#13;
distributions, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and South Korea&#13;
have much in common despite their widely different political&#13;
systems and economic strategies. At the remoter level the&#13;
explanations differ, and - as discussed earlier - Taiwan&#13;
57 India is the joker in the pack showing up in a high position&#13;
(fourth among the 16 according to the Borda ranking, below&#13;
Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia, but above South Korea).&#13;
58 In fact, there is evidence that the income distributional&#13;
situation in Peru and Brazil are even worse than that&#13;
represented in Table 7, and alternative estimates suggest&#13;
higher inequality. See World Development Report 1979,&#13;

and South Korea rely on high employment at a reasonable&#13;
wage as an instrument, while Sri Lanka leans on security&#13;
outside the market mechanism.   At a still remoter level, the&#13;
former pair of countries have profited from the strategy&#13;
of export expansion, while Sri Lanka has not used such a&#13;
strategy, nor is Yugoslav planning especially export oriented.&#13;
As explained earlier, learning from the experience of Taiwan&#13;
or Korea need not take the form of seeing virtues in export&#13;
expansion irrespective of the nature of the country, and indeed&#13;
the remoter we move in the chain of explanation, the more&#13;
conditional, in general, the explanation becomes.&#13;
The specific nature of the economic problems faced by&#13;
these countries to which their economic strategies responded&#13;
has often tended to be ignored. But on these specificities,&#13;
the remoter explanations may substantially depend. Consider,&#13;
for example, the strategy of relatively free trade with absent&#13;
or refunded import duties, used by Taiwan. The necessity of such&#13;
a policy for export expansion in the Taiwanese context has been&#13;
expla.-ned admirably clearly by Maurice Scott (1979).&#13;
"Taiwan has very few mineral resources and strictly&#13;
limited agricultural resources. It could only prosper,&#13;
and has in fact prospered, by exporting what effectively&#13;
are labor and capital services. These services, however,&#13;
have mainly taken the form of adding value to imported&#13;
materials rather than being services pure and simple&#13;
(as are tourism, banking, transportation, and the like).&#13;
Thus the most important single condition for an export&#13;
'take-off' was access by manufacturers to imported&#13;
materials, components, and capital equipment at world&#13;
prices. For a typical manufacturer in one of Taiwan's&#13;
export industries ... materials account for around 65&#13;
to 70 per cent of the selling value of output, capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
altogether receives a further 5 to 12 per cent of&#13;
selling value, and, of this, over half can be attributed&#13;
to costs of plant machinery, vehicles, and stocks of&#13;
materials. Hence, the total percentage of selling&#13;
value represented by the cost of materials or equipment&#13;
might be around 70 to 75 per cent or even more for a&#13;
typical exporter. If his exports are sold at world&#13;
prices, without benefit of any subsidy, he must be&#13;
able to buy these materials and equipment at or close&#13;
to world prices if the export is to be profitable.&#13;
A 40 per cent tax on materials and equipment would wipe&#13;
out, not merely all potential profit, but also all&#13;
potential wages, fuel costs, or payment for other&#13;
bought-in services (advertising and other selling costs,&#13;
rent of buildings and land, and so forth), and a much&#13;
smaller tax, say 10 per cent, would make many exports&#13;
totally unprofitable." 5&#13;
Under the circumstances the compelling advantages of&#13;
Taiwan's policy regarding imports are clear enough, but these&#13;
may or may not be shared by other countries with different&#13;
economic characteristics (e.g., larger economies, greater&#13;
mineral resources, less skill of the kind needed for export&#13;
expansion in the present world markets, etc.). Similar&#13;
discriminating analysis can be done with other instruments,&#13;
e.g., high savings rate, social welfare delivery systems, and&#13;
there is need for caution in reading lessons from success&#13;
stories.&#13;
The ways of achieving widespread entitlements differ,&#13;
and while different economic strategies have things in common&#13;
both in terms of ultimate consequences as well as in underlying&#13;
causation, the precise combination of instruments and policies&#13;

varies tremendously with the conditions in different economies.&#13;
In a somewhat stylized form Diagram 3 brings out such contrasts.&#13;
Roughly path a tries to capture the causal mechanism in&#13;
South Korea and Taiwan; path c that in Sri Lanka; and paths b and&#13;
c that in Yugoslavia. It is common to all these strategies&#13;
that low poverty in the form of high longevity and low&#13;
proportion of population below the poverty line is brought&#13;
about by a widespread distribution of entitlements, but&#13;
beyond this immediate link there are sharp differences in the&#13;
way such entitlement delivery is made. There is similarity&#13;
also in the role ultimately played by calculated and determined&#13;
public policy (see sections 3, 4 and 5). But while the Korean-&#13;
Taiwanese causal mechanism goes through industrial expansion&#13;
with exports expanding much faster, employment-oriented fast&#13;
growth, achievements in total income enhancement and in income&#13;
distribution, the Sri Lankan path goes through social welfare&#13;
programmes, public distribution systems, achievements in income&#13;
distribution and in non-income advantages (e.g., in people&#13;
having better health when the income subsidy comes in the&#13;
form of food, medical provisions, etc.). The yugoslav&#13;
experience fits neither since it is somewhat similar to the&#13;
Korean-Taiwanese strategy of high growth with good distribution,&#13;
but differs from it in not having export expansion noticeably&#13;
faster than the growth of national product 60 and in having a&#13;
more developed social security system.&#13;
60 Yugoslavia's growth rate per year of GNP per capita during 1960-7f&#13;
has been 5.6 per cent, which is a good deal higher than that&#13;
of Sri Lanka's 2%, and closer to Taiwan's 6.2% and South Korea's&#13;
7.4%. On the other hand, while the annual percentage growth&#13;
rates of exports of Yugoslavia, being 7.8% and 5.4% respectively&#13;
over 1960-70 and 1970-77, were higher than those of Sri Lanka&#13;
(4.6% and -5.3%), they fell far short of Taiwan's 23.7% and&#13;
16.7% and South Korea's 35.2% and 30.7%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
It is only natural: that "lessons' will be sought from&#13;
the experience of those countries which have been unusually&#13;
successful in poverty elimination. But the lessons to be&#13;
drawn have to concentrate on understanding the functional&#13;
roles of various instruments rather than on blind imitation&#13;
of the instruments themselves. Other countries can learn&#13;
much from the experieAce of success stories if the causal&#13;
mechanisms are fully studied and remoter causes distinguished&#13;
from the less remote ones.61   To what extent, say, fast growth&#13;
is possible with export industries taking the lead, is a question&#13;
that can be answered for any particular country only by looking&#13;
.62&#13;
at the details of its economic circumstances.     The same applies&#13;
to the possibility of delivering provisions through social&#13;
welfare programmes.   Neither of these circumstantial condition-&#13;
alities renders the experience of the successful countries&#13;
unproductive for policy formulation, but blind imitation may&#13;
well have counter-productive consequences.&#13;
7.     Starvation and Entitlement Failues: Case Studies&#13;
It was noted earlier that Ethiopia and Bangladesh are&#13;
61 This applies also to learning from the experience of&#13;
-  communist countries which have had an especially good&#13;
record in the expansion of expectation of life (see&#13;
section 3).&#13;
62 Taiwan and South Korea are quite different from the&#13;
general run of developing countries in many respects,&#13;
e.g., educational background, urbanization, port&#13;
facilities, successful land reform carried out earlier,&#13;
history of power:using industrial production, and the&#13;
nature of the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
among the poorest countries in the world in terms of GNP&#13;
per capita as well as the usual parameters of poverty, e.g.,&#13;
proportion of people below the poverty line, and expectation&#13;
of life. They are also among the few countries which have&#13;
had actual famines in recent years, viz., in 1973 and 1974&#13;
in Ethiopia and in 1974 in Bangladesh. Insofar as there is&#13;
hardly any manifestation of poverty that begins to compare&#13;
with famines, the experience of these two countries in this&#13;
respect deserve particular attention in an international&#13;
view of poverty.&#13;
In the context of success stories discussed in the&#13;
preceding sections, much attention was paid to the widely&#13;
shared pattern of entitlements guaranteeing the means of&#13;
subsistence to the population. In turning to the grim tales&#13;
of starvation and famines, the concept of entitlement remains&#13;
especially relevant, and it may be useful at this stage to&#13;
discuss the conceptual apparatus a bit more. Entitlement&#13;
relations are primarily legal relations - who is given the&#13;
right to have what according to (i) the prevailing legal system,&#13;
and (ii) the economic, political, social and cultural characteristics&#13;
affecting the position of different people within that system.&#13;
A person starves when he cannot establish entitlement to an&#13;
adequate quantity of food. Such failure of entitlement may or&#13;
may not have very much to do with the total supply of food&#13;
in that country. Further, to say that starvation depends not&#13;
merely on the total supply of food, but also on its distribution,&#13;
asserts hardly anything at all, since this just redescribes&#13;
the fact of the starvation. What has to be examined is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
economic reality that leads to such unequal distribution of&#13;
food and to starvation.&#13;
It was mentioned earlier that in a market economy a&#13;
person's entitlements depend on his ownership as well as on&#13;
the terms at which he can exchange - through trade or product-&#13;
ion - what he owns, for other commodities. A person's ability&#13;
to acquire any bundle -with enough food can collapse either&#13;
because of a sharp fall of his ownership, or because of a&#13;
worsening of his "exchange entitlement", i.e., the terms at&#13;
which he can exchange his ownership bundle into other bundles. 63&#13;
The importance of loooking into entitlement relations&#13;
as opposed to over-all availability data is brought out by&#13;
examining the inability of the availability data to give us&#13;
clues as to the genesis of famines in Ethiopia and Bangladesh.&#13;
The Ethiopian famine killed, according to various estimates,&#13;
64&#13;
between 50,000 to 200,000 people,    most of them dying during&#13;
1973; while the famine continued into 1974 with a somewhat&#13;
different geographical focus, the mortality was a good deal&#13;
lower then. Was 1973 a year of exceptionally bad food avail-&#13;
ability in Ethiopia? It would appear that this was far&#13;
from the case. Table 8 provides estimates of calorie avail-&#13;
ability per head in Ethiopia in 1973 compared with previous&#13;
years, and it would seem that the availability in 1973 was more&#13;
or less the same as that in previous years - higher than some&#13;
and lower than others.&#13;
62  Formal presentation of entitlement relations can be found&#13;
in Sen (1980b, Appendices A and B).&#13;

methodological issues and some minor problems with&#13;
these data, see Sen (1980b, Chapter, 7). The 1971&#13;
figures could not be obtained.&#13;
The genesis of the famine can, in fact, be traced to&#13;
varying patterns of entitlements. The famine concentrated in&#13;
the province of Wollo, and it is certainly true that Wollo&#13;
did have a. substantial decline in the output of foodgrains&#13;
during that year. But the question that arises then is why&#13;
didn't food move into Wollo to meet the unsatisfied demand&#13;
since there was no real shortage of food for the country as&#13;
a whole? This is where the nature of market entitlements&#13;
comes in.  The Wollo farmer who lost his crop not merely lost&#13;
the food he could eat, but also his main ownership bundle with&#13;
which he could enter the market. He did not have anything&#13;
to buy food with in the market, and the good availability of&#13;
food in the country as a whole will tell us nothing about his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69&#13;
ability to command food through the market mechanism.&#13;
This entitlement explanation of starvation in Wollo&#13;
can be contrasted with another explanation that has been&#13;
offered, viz., the lack of transport facilities - especially&#13;
the absence of a road network in Wollo. This explanation&#13;
comes into difficulty for at least three different reasons.&#13;
First, while roads within Wollo are underdeveloped, the two&#13;
main Ethiopian highways pass through Wollo, and indeed the&#13;
north-south highway passes right through the most affected&#13;
region of Wollo. Food shortage in this region cannot,&#13;
therefore, be explained by the lack of road development.&#13;
Second, there are reports throughout the famine period of&#13;
food moving out of Wollo into other regions of Ethiopia,&#13;
especially Addis Ababa and Asmera.66 Third, despite widespread&#13;
starvation and famine, food prices rose remarkably little in&#13;
Wollo, and indeed for some crops even came down. Clearly,&#13;
something more than food output collapsed in Wollo, viz., the&#13;
power of the Wollo population to buy food and indeed even to&#13;
retain the much reduced food supply of the province.&#13;
Aside from the farmer, the pastoralist was also affected&#13;
both in Wollo in 1973 (mainly nomads of the Afar community)&#13;
and in Harerghe in 1974 (mostly nomads of the Ogaden Somali&#13;
and Issa Somali communities). In analysing their deprivation,&#13;
65 For a more detailed discussion, with data, see Sen&#13;
(1980b, Chapter 7).&#13;
66 Such food "counter-movement" is, in fact, a common phenomenon&#13;
of a particular type of famines ( see Sen (1980a, 1980b)),&#13;
and was a major political issue in the Irish famine of&#13;
the 1840s, Chinese rice riots of906 and 1910, and on&#13;
other occasions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70&#13;
it can be seen that they suffered not merely from a fall&#13;
in the animal stock due to drought, but even more from a&#13;
precipitate fall in the exchange rate of animals for food-&#13;
grains; these exchanges normally meet about half the calorie&#13;
67&#13;
requirements of the pastoralist.     The entitlements were&#13;
hit at both ends, and this pattern seems to be quite common&#13;
68&#13;
in the region (and in Sahel countries),    whereby a fall in&#13;
both animal stock and foodgrains stock goes with a sharp&#13;
decline in the exchange rate against      animals.   The phenom-&#13;
enon is connected with animals being a store of value for the&#13;
pastoralist which he has to flog in the market when short of&#13;
cash. It also relates to the important fact that foodgrains&#13;
being a cheaper food, the pastoralist moves to consuning more&#13;
foodgrain offering more animals in the market when the death&#13;
69&#13;
of animals makes him poorer.     Hit by drought, the pastoralist&#13;
was smashed by the market mechanism.&#13;
In understanding the nature and the magnitude of&#13;
.starvation in Ethiopia during the famine years, the entitlement&#13;
relations have to be closely examined. While it is tempting&#13;
to think of famines in Ethiopia being caused by general poverty,&#13;
since it is one of the poorest countries in the world, the&#13;
67 See Sen (1980b, Chapter 7).&#13;
68  See Sen (1980b, Chapter 8).&#13;
69 A similar phenomenon can be seen with fishermen in Bengal,&#13;
though somewhat less starkly.&#13;
70 The Afar pastoralist also suffered from the growth of&#13;
commercial crops in the valley of the Awash river,&#13;
depriving him from the best grazing ground for the dry&#13;
season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
actual famine cannot be explained in terms of low average&#13;
income or low food availability per head.71&#13;
The same is true of the Bangladesh famine of 1974.&#13;
The foodgrains availability in Bangladesh in 1974 compared&#13;
with that in the previous years is reported in Table 9.&#13;

71 The 1974 availability in Ethiopia was worse but not&#13;
disastrously so, and the bulk of the famine deaths&#13;
had taken place in 1973 itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
While there were some years in the preceding ten in which&#13;
food availability was higher than in 1974, In most years&#13;
that was not the case. Indeed, if one were to look for a&#13;
plausible candidate for being a "famine year" in the first&#13;
half of the seventies, one would have been least likely to&#13;
pick 1974, which had higher food availability than any other&#13;
year during 1971-75. (The comparison with 1975 is not given&#13;
in Table 9, but in fact the availability per head in 1974&#13;
compared with 1975 was 7% higher.72&#13;
In fact, unlike in Ethiopia in which starvation could&#13;
be related to regional food availability (even though that&#13;
itself requires an entitlement explanation, as we saw), in&#13;
Bangladesh districtwise food availability data give no clue to&#13;
the geographical distribution of hunger. The highest rates of&#13;
destitution were observed in the districts of Rangpur, Mymensingh,&#13;
Dinajpur and Sylhet. In terms of food availability per head,&#13;
of the 19 districts these four were among the top five (indeed&#13;
ranked 1, 2, 3 and 5)' 73&#13;
The explanation has to be sought in terms of variations&#13;
in entitlements in the market economy of Bangladesh. The&#13;
famine was precipita~ted by flooding of the Brahmaputra river&#13;
during June to September of 1974. It affected the standing&#13;
rice crop (aus crop, harvested in July-August), and more&#13;
importantly, it affected the planting and transplanting of&#13;
the winter-harvest of rice (aman crop), the most important crop&#13;
in Bangladesh. The availability figures for the famine year&#13;
72 Alamgir (1979, Table 6.23).&#13;
73 See Alamgir (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
1974 - the famine raged from July to November - were not&#13;
much reduced by these losses, since the aus crop was otherwise&#13;
good, and since the aman crop, which did decline, is harvested&#13;
in December - after the famine was over. On the other hand,&#13;
the flooding had an immediate impact on the employment of&#13;
rural labour, since the work requirement for harvesting aus,&#13;
and more importantly, for planting and transplanting aman,&#13;
was immediately and sharply reduced. An occupational breakdown&#13;
of the destitutes shows that the most affected group - both in&#13;
terms of absolute number of destitutes as well as in terms of&#13;
intensity of destitution (percentage of population destituted) -&#13;
was that of rural wage labourers.&#13;
The entitlements of the rural labourers were slashed&#13;
both by the decline in employment opportunity as well as by&#13;
a downward movement of the exchange-entitlement of employed&#13;
labour through a fall in the amount of rice commanded by the&#13;
wage rate. The rice-exchange rate of rural labour fell by&#13;
42% for Bangladesh as a whole during June to October of 1974,&#13;
and t.he fall was highest in Mymensingh, Rangpur and Sylhet -&#13;
three of the four districts of top destitution.75&#13;
The market adjustments that have to be considered&#13;
concern not merely the labour market, but also the commodity&#13;
markets, in particular the market for rice (the staple food&#13;
of the Bengali). While the decline of the aman harvest of,rice&#13;
74  See Sen (1980b, Chapter 9).&#13;
75 The fourth - Dinajpur - also had a decline but not so high.&#13;
It appears, however, that a large proportion of destitutes&#13;
in Dinajpur "came from the adjoining district of Rangpur"&#13;
(Alamgir (1979)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
affected the total supply only after the famine was over,&#13;
the anticipated decline had an earlier impact on the market&#13;
supply of rice.76 This was particularly sharp since the&#13;
anticipated decline came after a good deal of inflation,&#13;
especially affecting rice prices,which had been going on for&#13;
some years previously, and since the usual buffer of American&#13;
grains was denied precisely at this moment because of a dispute&#13;
involving Bangladesh's trade with Cuba, with the United States&#13;
insisting on the suspension of jute exports to Cuba. 77&#13;
This is not the occasion to go into the details of&#13;
the process that led to the 1974 famine of Bangladesh.78&#13;
However, it is important to recognize that despite the general.&#13;
low level of mean income in Bangladesh, the famine struck&#13;
not in a year of especially low total real income or low food&#13;
availability, but, in fact, in a comparatively favourable year&#13;
in terms of these aggregate magnitudes. It would, therefore,&#13;
be a mistake to think of Bangladesh's - or Ethiopia's - poverty&#13;
in primarily Malthusian terms focusing on relative movements&#13;
of food output and population size. The ability of particular&#13;
groups - the Wollo farmer or the Rangpur rural labourer - to&#13;
avoid starvation is a question of their entitlements, and not&#13;
of aggregate availability. The variability of market entitle-&#13;
ments in the absence of social security provides the real&#13;
clue to the famines.&#13;

The elimination of famines from China - the country&#13;
that W.H. Mallory had called "the land of famine" 9 - relates&#13;
to the policy of public guarantee of elementary entitlements.&#13;
The vulnerability to shifts in exchange entitlement has been&#13;
effectively controlled by the government providing guarantees&#13;
80&#13;
*of employment and basic means of subsistence.     While poverty&#13;
in the sense of relative deprivation and even of some.types&#13;
of absolute deprivation clearly continueSto exist in China,&#13;
the importance of eliminating the most extreme type of&#13;
vulnerability can hardly be over-estimated.&#13;
8.     Advise, Dissent and Critical Assessment&#13;
A wide range of issues have been covered in this paper,&#13;
taking an overview of levels of poverty, their changes over&#13;
time, and some of the underlying causal mechanisms governing&#13;
these changes. While there will be no attempt to summarize&#13;
the discussion, it may be useful to put together some of the&#13;
more Veneral findings to place the discussion in perspective.&#13;
In discussing the issues with which this paper is&#13;
concerned, it is sometimes asked: "What are the practical&#13;
lessons? What would you advise the Finance Minister to do?"&#13;
The format provided by answering these questions is rather&#13;
limited from several points of view. First, the line between&#13;
theory and practice is a difficult one to draw. Second, not&#13;
all practical lessons happen to interest Finance Ministers.&#13;
79 Mallory (1926).&#13;
80 See, among others, Riskin (1975), Perkins (1976), Eckstein&#13;
(1977), Ishikawa (1977), Lardy (1978), and Rawski (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76&#13;
Third, many policy issues require more organization than&#13;
any Finance Minister can provide. It is also the case that&#13;
one might not wish to advise all Finance Ministers, and&#13;
indeed one would very likely not wish to speak to some at&#13;
all. Nevertheless, it is useful to think of what one might&#13;
tell a sympathetic Finance Minister treating this as a&#13;
format for gathering together what one may have learned. I&#13;
have a go at this in what follows, facing a grim Finance Minister.&#13;
(1) A poverty removal programme must, naturally,&#13;
depend on the concept of poverty used. The focus here has&#13;
recently shifted from viewing poverty as inadequacy of means&#13;
e.g., insufficient income, to poverty as unsatisfactory&#13;
results, e.g., low expectation of life. (Indeed, Minister,&#13;
I could have lent you Morris's book on "Physical Quality of&#13;
Life Index" but for the fact that your stupidly prurient Customs&#13;
Officers have confiscated my copy.) There is much to be said&#13;
for this change of focus, and also for the typical result-&#13;
variables that have been chosen, e.g., longevity and literacy.&#13;
On the other hand, there has been a tendency to take an unduly&#13;
narrow view of results. Inability to buy enough food and&#13;
prevalence of hunger are not merely "causes" of possibly&#13;
disastrous consequences including death, but are also "results"&#13;
in their own right, and should figure in an estimation of&#13;
poverty even when they don't cause death (or illiteracy).&#13;
Indeed, suffering from inadequate income, hunger and malnutrit-&#13;
ion are features of poverty additional to the shortness of&#13;
life. Even when the former contributes to the latter, both&#13;
the shortness of life and suffering while alive have to be&#13;
considered as separate (though not independent) parameters&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
of poverty. Thus, the exercises on longevity and literacy,&#13;
important as they are, do not eliminate the need for looking&#13;
at income deprivation, malnutrition and other variables&#13;
representing current deprivation and suffering (section 1.3).&#13;
(2) There are great methodological problems in basing&#13;
poverty standards on average requirements of nutrition. Some&#13;
authors have stressed the need to view poverty as relative&#13;
deprivation. This provides, once again, an additional&#13;
perspective on poverty, supplementing but not supplanting&#13;
the approach of absolute deprivation (section 1.1). Another&#13;
criticism of basing poverty on malnutritional information has&#13;
come from authors such as Sukhatme and Srinivasan who have&#13;
pointed out the variability of nutritional requirements from&#13;
person to person. (This, Minister, is rapidly becoming the&#13;
new wisdom on the subject, and your bright, young research&#13;
officer is bound to tell you: "Malnutrition? Whatever precisely&#13;
can you mean?") The issue of variability is indeed a serious&#13;
one, and how one can tackle it will, of course, depend on the&#13;
extent. to which regularities of distribution over groups&#13;
can be observed.   But aside from that there is also the&#13;
question as to whether some status of its own should not be&#13;
given to deprivation in the form of not having enough income&#13;
to buy the average requirement of nutrition for that community,&#13;
,even when it is not clearly known what this person's own&#13;
nutritional necessities are (section 1.3). This criterion,&#13;
which leads to very old-fashioned measures, gets some support&#13;
from Rawlsian arguments in favour of the Difference Principle.&#13;
(3) Distributional questions have to be considered&#13;
in any measure of poverty, and such crude indicators as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
head-count measure are inherently defective because they&#13;
aggregate without taking note of the distributional issue.&#13;
Distribution-sensitive aggregation procedures can be and&#13;
have been devised (section 1.4). But all these measures&#13;
dealing with realized deprivation leave out an aspect of&#13;
poverty that relates to the sense of insecurity arising from&#13;
the vulnerability of one's economic position. This insecurity&#13;
is itself an aspect of poverty, even though the data on which&#13;
all the existing poverty measures are based are inadequate&#13;
in reflecting this aspect. It is important to look into the&#13;
sources of vulnerability, if any, of different sections of&#13;
the population (section 1.4).&#13;
(4) Some countries were separated out for good performance&#13;
in an international contrast, using data on longevity, literacy,&#13;
income and the proportion of population below poverty line.&#13;
(You asked, Minister, which political system wins these&#13;
contests, but the answer is less than straightforward, as&#13;
you will see.) Three groups stood out in these comparisons.&#13;
First, the communist countries did relatively well whenever&#13;
comparable data were available.   Second, the four rapidly&#13;
industrializing early capitalist countries in east Asia, viz.,&#13;
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, have very good&#13;
records, and the experience of the first two, which are sizeable&#13;
countries, are particularly important to study. Third,&#13;
Sri Lanka and Tanzania can be seen as having unusually good&#13;
achievement in some specific features of poverty removal,&#13;
despite their persisently low general income level (sections&#13;
2 and 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
(5) While concrete policies going with poverty&#13;
removal in these different types of countries have varied&#13;
a great deal, there have been fundamental similarities in&#13;
the variables through which these policies have worked.&#13;
There is much evidence that the success of poverty removal&#13;
depends ultimately on the ability to spread widely guarantees&#13;
of economic entitlements, and there are striking similariti'e's&#13;
in the experiences of these different types of countries in&#13;
(i) the coverage of entitlements, (ii) lowness of relative&#13;
income inequalities, and (iii) use of state power and reliance&#13;
on public policy (sections 4, 5 and 6). The differences have&#13;
rested in the way public policy has been used to provide&#13;
entitlement enhancement. For example, in the Korean-Taiwanese&#13;
experience this has happened, to a great extent, through employ-&#13;
ment oriented rapid growth reaching the bulk of the population,&#13;
while the Sri Lankan strategy has been to rely on social&#13;
services providing a similarly widespread coverage.&#13;
(6) There is much to be learned from the success of&#13;
Sout1 Korea and Taiwan in removing poverty. Their policies&#13;
in recent years have depended heavily on export promotion,&#13;
which has been recommended to other developing countries.&#13;
(You asked me, Minister, about the growing demand for concentrating&#13;
all efforts on export promotion. In warning you against this, I&#13;
would echo Orlando's words from As You Like It: "Thou art not&#13;
for the fashion of these times./ Where none will sweat but for&#13;
promotion" (II, iii, 56).) The relevance of export promotion to&#13;
the essence of South Korean and Taiwanese strategy may, in fact,&#13;
be a good deal less central than is sometimes claimed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80&#13;
First, export promotion is only one part of a whole package&#13;
of policies used by these countries, including massive capital&#13;
accumulation and building up an industrial base through import&#13;
substitution. Second, while the particular advantages and&#13;
difficulties of these countries made export promotion both&#13;
more easily achievable and more necessary, and other developing&#13;
countries may or may not find it possible to - or may or may not&#13;
need to - rely so much on export promotion, there are still&#13;
other things to be learned from the experiences of South&#13;
Korea and Taiwan (sections 4 and 6). The more immediate&#13;
antecedent of poverty removal in these countries has been&#13;
rapid expansion of employment. There are many aspects of&#13;
this experience aside from export promotion, that require&#13;
attention, including the combination of labour-intensive&#13;
technology and rapid accumulation of capital. If the circum-&#13;
stances of a particular country make the rapid expansion of&#13;
employment more easily achievable through import substitution,&#13;
then the Korean and Taiwanese experiences can be interpreted as&#13;
supporting such import-substituting growth, at a deeper level&#13;
(section 6).&#13;
(7) It is important to view Sri Lanka's achievements&#13;
not in terms of just one or two particular policies (such as food&#13;
distribution), but as a general approach of spreading entitlements&#13;
widely through direct public policy. (You asked, Minister, whether&#13;
these social welfare programmes do not adversely affect economic&#13;
growth. They might or might not, but even when they do, the&#13;
trade-off between direct welfare advantages and growth advantages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
seems to be rather favorable to the former.) Despite the well-&#13;
known powers of compound growth, the time taken to catch up with&#13;
the favourable results of direct welfare programmes by enhancing&#13;
growth seems to be very long indeed (section 5).&#13;
(8) The role of the government in poverty removal&#13;
seems to be a common feature of the experience of such politically&#13;
diverse countries as South Korea, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania,&#13;
and Yugoslavia, not to mention other communist countries. (You&#13;
refer, Minister, to the role of the "invisible hand" in the&#13;
South Korean breakthrough, but it was fortified by a visible&#13;
arm that had few rivals in terms of muscle.)&#13;
(9) Poverty and over-all inequality need not go&#13;
together even when the average income level is given, since&#13;
the former concentrates on the distribution towards the bottom&#13;
while the latter takes a broader picture. As it happens, however,&#13;
the countries which have had identifiably bad performance in terms&#13;
of poverty in comparison with their income levels, e.g., Brazil,&#13;
Mexico and Peru, also have had relatively more unequal over-all&#13;
distributions of income. On the other side, countries that have&#13;
performed relatively well in poverty removal also have done&#13;
comparatively better in reducing the over-all inequality of&#13;
incomes (section 6). (Minister, you can do worse than aim at&#13;
a general reduction of inequality in seeking poverty removal.)&#13;
(10)  The worst cases of poverty seem to go not merely&#13;
with low average prosperity, but also with especially vulnerable&#13;
entitlement systems. This applies not just to the "security"&#13;
view of poverty, which relates directly to such vulnerability&#13;
(see section 1.4), but also to poverty judged in more usual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
terms. Both Bangladesh and Ethiopia, which have bad records&#13;
in poverty, have also actually experienced severe starvation&#13;
and famines in recent years. (Food shortage, you say, Minister?&#13;
Not quite.) The famines have been connected with sudden failures&#13;
of entitlement systems. In fact in both countries the famines&#13;
took place without any substantial decline in over-all food avail-&#13;
ability, but the market mechanism played havoc with the entitlements&#13;
of particular economic groups (section 7). The entitlement failures&#13;
can be related to ownership declines or to the collapse of exchange&#13;
entitlement, reflecting the terms at which a person can exchange&#13;
his ownership into commo.dity bundles which he wishes to acquire.&#13;
The Malthusian focus on food supply per head provides little&#13;
clue to the genesis of the famines.&#13;
(11) The point is sometimes made, correctly, that studies&#13;
that concentrate on the relative performance of different&#13;
developing countries in poverty removal (like this one) tend&#13;
to miss an important general point, to wit, almost all developing&#13;
countries have made a good deal of progress in longevity, literacy,&#13;
etc., in the last few decades (see Table 3). Very often this&#13;
progress has been substantially more than in the preceding&#13;
thousands of years - a rather astonishing fact. Progress in&#13;
technology had clearly been a factor in this, but it is also&#13;
worth noting that there has been much more of deliberate public&#13;
policy aimed at these goals in the last few decades than ever&#13;
before. Achievements may have frequently fallen short of&#13;
attempts, but certainly even limited attempts have contributed&#13;
a great deal to achievements (section 5). (Even when, Minister,&#13;
public policy makers have had control of only a few levers&#13;
which they could manipulate, considerable achievements have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
sometimes been possible when these levers have been used&#13;
systematically.) To believe that deep down it is "all or&#13;
nothing" has the aura of wisdom, but it can also be crucially&#13;
misleading. Things are sometimes what they seem.&#13;
(12) The issue of entitlement guarantee is the central&#13;
question in poverty policy. While various alternative methods&#13;
of providing such guarantees contrast with each other, it is&#13;
on the existence of such guarantees that the success of poverty&#13;
removal has ultimately rested. The destituted Bangladeshi&#13;
rural labourer in the summer of 1974 would not have been thus&#13;
fired in China, would have found employment elsewhere in&#13;
South Korea, would have survived through social support&#13;
(especially free rice) in Sri Lanka, and would have been&#13;
saved by both employment opportunities and social security&#13;
in Yugoslavia. The alternative strategies have to be seen,&#13;
ultimately, in this light.&#13;

            Levels of poverty : policy and change
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper presents an overview of
            poverty, changes in poverty over time, and some of the
            causes of these changes. It opens with a discussion of
            various concepts of poverty, paying particular attention to
            recent controversy over nutitional norms and to the debate
            on whether poverty should be measured by such results as
            life expectancy or by such inputs as income. The comparative
            success of a wide range of countries in reducing poverty is
            then assessed, and a detailed examination is made of
            selected countries; South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan,
            Tanzania, and Yugoslavia. Particular attention is given to
            the causes of success and to the difficulties of drawing
            lessons from success stories. The paper then focuses on
            extreme causes of poverty, such as the famines in Bangladesh
            and Ethiopia in the first part of the 1970s. It concludes
            with a hypothetical dialogue on policy between the author
            and a developing-country finance minister.
