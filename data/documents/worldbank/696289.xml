SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Project Description, Administration and Implementation&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Government of Haiti is facing severe challenges: debilitated institutions, large macro-&#13;
economic imbalances, depleted productive assets, a dilapidated infrastructure, pervasive poverty&#13;
and a dilapidated environment. Between 1992-94, the country's economic performance and&#13;
social indicators worsened dramatically, accentuating the downward trend of the 1980s.&#13;
Following the return to constitutional rule, the Government of Prime Minister Smarck Michel&#13;
under President Aristide prepared an Emergency Economic Recovery Program (EERP) which&#13;
received the strong support of the international donor community and entered into an IMF Stand-&#13;
by Arrangement for the Haitian fiscal year 1994/95. Economic performance remained broadly&#13;
within its parameters. Real GDP growth amounted to about 4.5 percent, consumer price inflation&#13;
declined from 52 percent to 17 percent, and the gourde recovered from over G20 per dollar&#13;
during the embargo to G14.5 per dollar by end-September 1995.&#13;
2.    Following a deterioration in economic performance in the first half of 1995/96, a new&#13;
Government under President Preval has resumed the economic reform effort. The Government, in&#13;
cooperation with IMF and IDA, has prepared its 1995/96-98/99 Policy Framework Paper&#13;
outlining a comprehensive economic reform program, and negotiated an Enhanced Structural&#13;
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) with the IMF. The program will focus on: public finances, civil&#13;
service reform, private sector participation in public enterprises, trade liberalization and financial&#13;
sector reform. To assist in designing and carrying out some of these reforms, the Government has&#13;
requested IDA support through a Second Economic Recovery Credit (ERC II) and the proposed&#13;
TAP II.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.    The proposed TAP II will (i) strengthen the Haitian Government's capacity to design and&#13;
implement priority policy reforms, to be supported by the ERC II, in the areas of public finances&#13;
and privatization; and (ii) provide the analytical base for further structural adjustment measures&#13;
with focus on public sector modernization, which would be implemented over the next several&#13;
years. To this end, and in coordination with other donors, the TAP II will provide complementary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -                        Technical Annex&#13;
finance for consultants, goods and services, including training and dissemination of information to&#13;
the public, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
4.    The proposed project will provide the Government with the means and information to&#13;
advance its economic reform program and sustain the actions envisioned under the ERC II. It&#13;
complements technical assistance by other donors, in particular by IDB, which is preparing&#13;
parallel technical assistance components addressing tax and customs administrations, privatization&#13;
and financial sector reform.&#13;
5.    Specifically, the TAP II amounts to US$12.0 million, including US$0.6 million of&#13;
contingencies, and will cover the areas of public finances, private sector development and public&#13;
sector modernization through the following components, which are described in more detail&#13;
below: (i) Property Tax Reform Component (US$1.4 Million); (ii) Expenditure Management&#13;
Component (US$3.3 Million); (iii) Human Resources Management System Component (US$1.0&#13;
Million); (iv) Private Sector Development Component (US$3.0 Million); (v) Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Component (US$1. I Million); and (vi) Project Implementation Component&#13;
(US$1.6 Million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
1. PROPERTY TAX REFORM&#13;
Issues&#13;
6.    Haiti has one of the lowest revenue to GDP ratio in the world. From 8% in 1991, this&#13;
ratio declined to about 3% in 1994. This poor performance can be essentially attributed to a&#13;
deterioration of tax and customs administrations and a narrow tax base on account of generous&#13;
exemptions granted under the investment code and related legislation. In addition, there is a need&#13;
to simplify the tax system and reduce its distortionary effects. A further issue, which will gain&#13;
importance in the context of the Government's decentralization effort, is the negligible&#13;
contribution by property taxes, which amount to less than 0.1 percent of GDP.&#13;
7.    Tax and Customs Administration. The tax (DGI) and customs (AGD) administrations&#13;
are extremely weak. They lack qualified staff, are badly equipped, and have low salaries which&#13;
affect motivation and invite corruption.  Most work is carried out manually, facilities are&#13;
outdated, material supplies and vehicles limited, and working conditions poor. Coordination&#13;
within and between the two agencies is weak. DGI's approach toward revenue collection is&#13;
essentially passive: staff are concentrated in downtown Port-au-Prince, and rarely undertake&#13;
verification in the field. There is little attempt to cross-validate available information about the&#13;
tax base. In part, resources are diverted to administer nuisance taxes, whereas follow-up on key&#13;
taxes is neglected. AGD activities are also heavily concentrated in Port-au-Prince. Processing of&#13;
imports is cumbersome, and hampered by physical constraints and manual accounting. Customs&#13;
documents show gross inconsistencies in classification and evaluation of imports. Treatment of&#13;
assumed franchises and exemptions appears highly arbitrary. Customs control at the important&#13;
ports outside Port-au-Prince is ineffective, with even basic equipment like telephone lines lacking,&#13;
and controls abandoned_after office hours. Customs controls at the Port-au-Prince and Cap&#13;
Haitien airports suffer from similar problems.&#13;
8.    Fiscal Incentives and the Investment Code.  Haiti's investment code stipulates an&#13;
extremely generous and difficult to administer set of fiscal incentives. It includes three regimes&#13;
applicable to different types of enterprises, which grant decreasing exemptions from income taxes&#13;
and import duties over a period of up to 15 years. The investment code also includes regulations&#13;
which unduly restrict and distort investment decisions by domestic and foreign investors. In&#13;
addition to fiscal incentives, franchises and exemptions are granted on a discretionary basis to&#13;
enterprises and virtually all non-governmental organizations.  The benefits of granting these&#13;
incentives and exemptions are likely to be marginal to individual recipients, whereas the foregoing&#13;
revenue is probably considerable.&#13;
9.    Tax Structure and Rates.  Some features of  Haiti's tax structure exacerbate the&#13;
difficulties of a weak administration and introduce disincentives to private sector development.&#13;
These include a large number of tax brackets and lack of integration for taxes on income and&#13;
profits; a complex system of specific excise duties; a dual rate structure and a broad range of&#13;
exemptions for the value-added tax; and a proliferation of nuisance taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -                        Technical Annex&#13;
10.   Property Tax Administration. Currently, revenue from taxation of property -- the main&#13;
source of income for municipalities -- is negligible. Although there is strong potential to enhance&#13;
revenue collection, little has been done to take advantage of this revenue source. Even Port-au-&#13;
Prince, which covers the major part of the taxable base, has no proper land registry; and whatever&#13;
records are available, are poorly maintained. There has been no reevaluation of property values in&#13;
the last ten years, and there are no established criteria for evaluating property. Many of the new&#13;
constructions are not registered with the DGI. The situation is even worse in other towns and&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
11.   The Government has recognized the need for strengthening fiscal performance and is&#13;
committed to initiate reforms to increase tax yields in a sustainable manner and achieve a more&#13;
buoyant tax system while facilitating private sector development. To this end, the Government is&#13;
determined to improving revenue collection, broaden the tax base, and reduce the distortionary&#13;
effect of the tax system. In particular, its reform program includes: (i) strengthening tax and&#13;
customs administrations through establishing a large tax payers unit (LTU), upgrading facilities&#13;
and equipment, streamlining processes and providing staff training; (ii) reducing or eliminating&#13;
exemptions and deductions; and (iii) simplifying the tax system. By implementing these measures,&#13;
the Government expects to increase revenues to the level of 8 percent of GDP attained in 1991.&#13;
12.   To assist the Government in achieving its objectives, IDB, IMiF, and UNDP have agreed&#13;
to provide significant technical assistance to DGI. A joint US$1.4 million IMF and UNDP project&#13;
component focuses on providing fiscal advice and establishing the LTU. The terms of reference&#13;
for the LTU are to: (i) identify and register large tax payers, (ii) design and implement procedures&#13;
for assessing and collecting taxes from large tax payers; and (iii) provide training for DGI staff.&#13;
This project component includes the review of key taxes and the formulation of a reform&#13;
proposal. A US$1.9 million IDB project attempts to generalize the experience of the LTU and&#13;
also to implement an information system for the whole DGI. There is further the possibility that&#13;
some funding for equipment under a Japanese grant of US$5 million could be allocated to finance&#13;
computer equipment in DGI.&#13;
13.   In customs administration, CIDA, EC, UNCTAD, UNDP, and USAID intend to finance a&#13;
project focusing on the implementation of UNCTAD's computerized customs information&#13;
management system (ASYCUDA) in major ports. An initial budget proposal of US$2. I million&#13;
has been submitted to the relevant agencies to provide training in the use of a new customs&#13;
declaration form and to computerize data collection. The project will also create four regional customs&#13;
offices at Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitien, Gonaives, and Petit-Goave. In addition, IDB is assisting with a&#13;
US$1 .1 million project component, co-financed by Switzerland, to provide training and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the TAP In&#13;
14.   To support the Government's reform program, the property tax reform component of the&#13;
TAP II will finance the following activities: (i) reviewing the system of property taxation; (ii)&#13;
strengthening the property tax administration, including training; and (iii) creating a land registry&#13;
in Port-au-Prince and other major urban centers.&#13;
15.   System of Property Taxation (US$0.10 Million). The TAP II will finance consultancy&#13;
services to review the system of property taxation to improve buoyancy, equity and cost-&#13;
effectiveness. There are various fees related to owning properties. The study will examine the&#13;
need to rationalize and consolidate these fees.&#13;
16.   Property Tax Administration (US$0.70 Million). The TAP II will finance consultancy&#13;
services, equipment and training to strengthen the property tax administration within DGI. This&#13;
sub-component will include: (i) reviewing current institutional arrangements of property tax&#13;
administration and recommending appropriate changes; (ii) implementing information&#13;
management systems (iii) providing other relevant equipment and vehicles; (iv) designing and&#13;
implementing an appraisal system that will facilitate rapid assessment and valuation of properties&#13;
and their equitable treatment; and (vi) providing training in areas such as field assessment and&#13;
valuation, mass appraisal techniques, use of computer systems, enforcement procedures, and audit&#13;
and control.&#13;
17.   Land Registry (US$0.60 Million). The TAP II will finance the preparatory work and&#13;
cartography required to establish a land registry of properties in Port-au-Prince and other major&#13;
urban centers.&#13;
2. EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT&#13;
Issues&#13;
18.   Public expenditure management in Haiti suffers from  a range of structural and&#13;
administrative problems which limits the impact of the scarce domestic resources and generous&#13;
but disparate foreign assistance. Missions by IMF and IDA, among others, have pointed to the&#13;
following problems:&#13;
* the absence of a consistent long-term macro and fiscal planning framework may result&#13;
in a serious imbalance between recurrent and capital expenditures threatening the&#13;
sustainability of investment;&#13;
* the independent budgeting and accounting of recurrent and capital expenditures,&#13;
together with the exclusion of most of the externally funded capital expenditures from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -                        Technical Annex&#13;
the budget further impedes design and implementation of a sustainable government&#13;
expenditure program;&#13;
*  the lack of clearly defined responsibilities and procedures regarding external assistance&#13;
constitutes a bottleneck in the utilization of assistance offered;&#13;
*  the budgeting procedures do not facilitate a rational identification of priorities;&#13;
*  the rudimentary budget classifications make it difficult to analyze the effectiveness of&#13;
public spending in relation to any government development objectives.&#13;
*  the existing accounting framework is not conducive to effective management of&#13;
government resources;&#13;
*  there is no proper bank reconciliation and the amount of cash available to the&#13;
Government cannot be determined;&#13;
*  the system of pre-audits constitutes a serious bottleneck in the execution of the budget&#13;
without necessarily preventing improprieties;&#13;
*  there is no internal audit, and external audit is weak;&#13;
*  the present payment system is exceedingly slow and cumbersome, contributing to the&#13;
emergence of comples courants and other special accounts, which -- while facilitating&#13;
close to 50 percent of government expenditures -- effectively escape the established,&#13;
already weak control mechanisms;&#13;
a  the current accounting system does not provide a basis for proper management of&#13;
assets and liabilities, causing problems with payment discipline, in particular since the&#13;
free-standing computerized debt management system has ceased to function; and&#13;
*  the existing system  does not deliver any quantitative or qualitative information&#13;
required for effective macroeconomic management.&#13;
Government's Reform Program and Recommendations&#13;
19.   The Government is acutely aware of the shortcoming of existing systems and routines,&#13;
and there are several donors that have expressed an interest in assisting in the strengthening of&#13;
these very core functions of Government. A joint IMF and UNDP project allocates US$0.6&#13;
million to expenditure management in the Ministry of Finance. U.NDP is also providing US$1.0&#13;
million to strengthen the Ministry of Planning, and preparing a follow-up project for the Cellule&#13;
d'Apui du Pilotage in the Ministry of Planning, which would deepen support in four areas: (i)&#13;
identification of strategic projects; (ii) establishment of an information system on the external&#13;
assistance to Haiti; (iii) strengthening of the programming and coordinating capacity; and (iv)&#13;
strengthening program and project monitoring. This follow-up project is still at the preparation&#13;
stage and the exact financing sources and the detailed budget remains to be defined. There is&#13;
further the possibility that some funding for equipment under a Japanese grant of US$5 million&#13;
could be allocated to finance computer equipment in the Ministry of Finance. Another donor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-                          Technical Annex&#13;
which has expressed strong interest in the general area of government financial management is&#13;
USAID. However, it has not yet prepared any concrete project proposal.&#13;
20.   It is imperative that these assistance efforts be very closely coordinated in order to avoid&#13;
duplication of efforts and establish a truly integrated financial management system. To this end,&#13;
efforts have been made to ensure complementarity and a rational division of labor between, in the&#13;
first instance, the INIF/UNDP project and the IDA support outlined below.&#13;
21.   The key to achieving integration will be a common framework for information&#13;
management. It has therefore been agreed that the selection and development of the required&#13;
software be executed under one unified direction. The information management component will&#13;
thus cover data processing pertaining to macro-planning, project preparation and monitoring,&#13;
donor coordination, human resources management, budgeting, tax administration, budget&#13;
execution, payroll and pension management, accounting, payments, and cash, debt and asset&#13;
management.&#13;
22.   The very core of the integrated system will be the accounting system. Other systems&#13;
would either be direct subsystems to the general ledger -- for example, payroll preparation and&#13;
debt management -- or linked to the accounts through shared data -- for example, human&#13;
resources information and project preparation.&#13;
23.   To facilitate coordination of donor assistance, the information management component&#13;
will serve as the foundation and the vehicle by which area specific reforms could be implemented.&#13;
Given the longer-term nature of support aiming at a radical improvement of information&#13;
management, the comparative strengths of the respective organizations and the degree of freedom&#13;
of each one to choose its implementation approach, it has been agreed that the primary funding&#13;
partner for the Government for the information management software will be IDA.&#13;
24.   Equipment and policy advice regarding taxation will be covered to a large extent by IDB&#13;
and IMF/UNDP. Acquisition of hardware in this area, however, will be closely coordinated with&#13;
the information technology firm contracted under the TAP II. A similar approach will be taken&#13;
for government finance statistics, which is also covered by the IMF/UNDP project. In this area,&#13;
the information technology firm will also be responsible for the purchase and development of&#13;
suitable software funded under the TAP II. The procurement of personal computers for other&#13;
functions of the Ministry of Finance will be the covered by the TAP II, possibly supported by&#13;
Japanese grant funds. UNDP will provide the necessary personal computers for the Ministry of&#13;
Planning. Servers and networking serving the overall Ministries of Finance and Planning will be&#13;
the responsibility of the TAP II.&#13;
25.   Two crucial areas not covered by other donors, auditing and debt management, will also&#13;
be covered by the TAP II. The TAP II will further provide technical assistance in the area of&#13;
expenditure management with a focus on accounting. This assistance will be closely coordinated&#13;
with that of the IMF/iUNDP project which would focus more on budgeting issues. The picture&#13;
above seeks to describe the approach taken to donor coordination and funding for expenditure&#13;
management.&#13;

26. To support the Government's reform program, the expenditure management component&#13;
of the TAP II will finance the following activities: (i) implementing a core integrated financial&#13;
management system; (ii) reforming the accounting framework; (iii) reforming auditing practices&#13;
and legislation; (iv) strengthening debt and asset management; and (v) providing training&#13;
pertaining to all areas of expenditure management.&#13;
27.   Integrated Financial Management System  (US$1.16 Million).   The TAP II will&#13;
finance an integrated financial management system, the core of which will be a modern system of&#13;
government accounting. The system will build on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and&#13;
will be able to also mimic the present budgetary accounting as long as duplicate records of public&#13;
expenditure are kept in the current format by the spending agencies. At a later stage, accounting&#13;
routines at the spending agencies will be computerized and in the process upgraded to modern&#13;
accounting standards. Such a gradual approach will allow to maintain financial control and ensure&#13;
continuity in the financial statistics.&#13;
28.   The central accounting system will be capable of recording payments executed by third&#13;
parties, most notably donors, on behalf of the Government. An integral part of the central&#13;
accounting system would be sub-systems for budgeting and budget execution control, debt&#13;
management and for payroll management. The payroll system, in turn, will be linked to the&#13;
human resources information system to ensure the correctness of the payroll. A further module&#13;
linked to the core accounting system will cover project information on the different steps in the&#13;
project cycle. The project will finance a public investment expert to assist the Government in&#13;
managing the public sector investment program. Finally, the integrated financial management&#13;
system will also cover tax administration which will be developed as a sub-ledger to the&#13;
accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -                        Technical Annex&#13;
29.   For the purchase and development of the information system,  IDA will finance a&#13;
competitively awarded, two-year renewable contract with a software consultancy firm with&#13;
relevant international experience. The firm will be expected to seek cooperation with a local&#13;
Haitian partner in order to guarantee future support of the system. The firm will be responsible for&#13;
the installation of the central servers and the necessary networking for the building of the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Planning, including network cards etc.. If necessary, the firm will also&#13;
coordinate the rehabilitation of the electrical wiring of the building and if necessary the installation&#13;
of generators and other electrical backup systems. It is expected that the same firm would be&#13;
contracted for the purchase and development of the human resources information system. The&#13;
latter component is, however, budgeted separately and is not included in the expenditure&#13;
management component. To the extent possible, the policy will be to use software commercially&#13;
available. Where this is not feasible, possible economies of scale in development would be&#13;
exploited by coordinating with similar IDA financed projects in Nicaragua and Guatemala.&#13;
30.   Expenditure Management and Accounting (US$1.1 Million). This sub-component&#13;
will, in close coordination with the work of the IMF/UNDP project in budgeting, provide a long-&#13;
term accounting advisor and other technical assistance to the Ministries of Finance and Planning&#13;
with the objective to thoroughly modernize the central government expenditure management and&#13;
accounting framework, including for public sector investment management.  One of the&#13;
responsibilities of the proposed technical assistance will be to coordinate the preparation of the&#13;
specifications for the integrated financial management system. The accounting advisor will also&#13;
coordinate the training in accounting. This training will be a combination of in-country and&#13;
overseas training as well as study tours to relevant public administrations in the Americas and&#13;
Europe.&#13;
31.   Auditing (US$0.70 Million). This sub-component will benefit the Ministry of Finance&#13;
and the Cour des comptes ( the national auditing office). It will provide long-term advisors in&#13;
internal (18 months) and external (18 months) auditing, including performance auditing. Short-&#13;
term expertise will be provided to review the legislative framework for auditing, with a view to&#13;
replace pre-auditing requirements with ex post auditing. Funds will also be made available for&#13;
in-country and overseas training as well as for study tours by officials to national auditing offices&#13;
in selected countries. In addition, training funds will be allocated to finance fellowships with well-&#13;
established national audit offices.&#13;
32.   Debt and Asset Management (US$0.34 Million).  This sub-component will assist the&#13;
Government in debt and asset management through financing of: (i) international expertise for a&#13;
total of twelve months over the next three years; (ii) purchase of personal computers to be used&#13;
specifically for debt and asset management; (iii) training through established IDB, IME or IDA&#13;
programs, for four persons for three weeks each for the next three years; and (iv) training by way&#13;
of local seminars, at the pace of two in the first year and one in each of the following two years.&#13;
The cost for procuring and developing software for debt management is included in the integrated&#13;
financial management system sub-component.&#13;
33.   Implementation Format for Accounting and Debt Management Sub-Components.&#13;
For the execution of the support to accounting and debt management, IDA will finance a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -                          Technical Annex&#13;
competitively awarded, two-year contract with a well reputed management consulting firm with&#13;
relevant international experience. The contracted firm will be encouraged to collaborate with a&#13;
Haitian firm to build up professional capacity outside as well as inside the public administration.&#13;
34.   Training pertaining to Expenditure Management. Included in the sub-components&#13;
described above is funding for formal training amounting to US$0.38 million in all areas&#13;
pertaining to expenditure management. The training in all sub-components will comprise in-&#13;
country and overseas training as well as study tours.&#13;
3. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
Issues&#13;
35.   One of the fundamental issues in governance is the Government's capacity to establish,&#13;
manage, legalize and monitor an efficient civil service. Currently, the civil service in Haiti is afflicted by&#13;
weak financial management, inadequate infornation management, and non-enforced rules and&#13;
regulations. There is a complete vacuum in the monitoring and control of personnel. The high&#13;
concentration of civil servants in low level positions affects the quality of service delivery, and the&#13;
predisposition to work in the capital is detrimental to the functioning of the public sector in the rural&#13;
regions and other major agglomerations.&#13;
36.   The budgetary allocation for recurrent expenditures is considerably unbalanced. For the fiscal&#13;
year 1994/95, the budgetary allocation for personnel expenditures for the approximately 45,000 civil&#13;
service positions amounts to more than 70 percent of the total budget allocations for recurrent&#13;
expenditures, leaving few resources to carry out operations and maintenance works. Yet, the&#13;
remuneration of the average civil servant in December 1994 amounted to only five times the GDP per&#13;
capita for 1994, and total personnel expenditures amounted to a moderate 6 percent of GDP. This&#13;
indicates that the issue with the wage bill resides with: (i) the scarcity of resources available to&#13;
recurrent expenditures as a whole; and (ii) the bottom-heavy structure of the civil service, with more&#13;
than two-thirds of positions allocated to unskilled and semi-skilled civil servants.&#13;
37.   The management of the payroll file is severely neglected. Even basic data on civil servants --&#13;
such as identity, geographical locations, responsibilities, grades -- are not available. There is no link&#13;
between the fiscal identity card filed with DGI and the computerized payroll file information. This&#13;
allows for fraud, illegal double employment and other abuses.&#13;
38.   In addition, contractual employees are often paid outside the budget under the comples&#13;
courants. While 47 percent of recurrent expenditures are channeled through these advances, they are&#13;
not subject to the same scrutiny as the other spending allocated under budgetary resources, and are&#13;
used to cover a variety of expenditures. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance has not been able to&#13;
establish the number of employees who are paid through these special accounts.&#13;
39.   Currently, there is no particular central agency which effectively exercises control over humnan&#13;
resources management. Rather, each ministry acts independently and controls the management of its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
personnel. There exists no computerized central file of the civil service employees, and the personnel&#13;
files maintained at the line ministries are not computerized and incomplete.&#13;
40.   The laws of 1982/83 pertaining to the civil service are extensive, well written and represent an&#13;
impressive prototype of civil service legislation. However, the legal and administrative procedures for&#13;
civil service administration and regulation as elaborated in the legislation and the financial manual are&#13;
not properly followed in practice.&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
41.   The Government of Haiti has recognized the need to strengthen its institutional capacity to&#13;
improve delivery of public services, taking into account the current fiscal constraints. It has prepared a&#13;
short-term civil service reform action plan consistent with the medium-term assistance under the TAP&#13;
II. The Government also dismissed, in October 1994, some 1,200 employees who had been added to&#13;
the payroll immediately before the Constitutional Government took office. A law for early, voluntary&#13;
and involuntary retirement to allow further streamlining of the public service is currently being&#13;
discussed by Parliament.&#13;
42.   To support the Government's reforrn program, UNDP is financing a US$1 million project to&#13;
strengthen the Government's public administration management functions through advice and training.&#13;
The US$5 million Public Administration Reform project by USAID also provides a source of funding&#13;
for technical assistance in the area of civil service reform. At the same time, the Government has also&#13;
expressed the interest in a comprehensive approach to civil service reform. To lay the foundation for&#13;
such a comprehensive reform, it has requested IDA assistance to establish a human resources&#13;
management system in the context of the TAP II.&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the TAP H&#13;
43.   To support the Government's reform program, the human resources management systems&#13;
component of the TAP II will finance the following activities: (i) conducting a civil service census; (ii)&#13;
implementing a human resources information system (HRIS) in the Ministry of Finance; and (iii)&#13;
providing training for staff implicated in human resources management.&#13;
44.   Civil Service Census (US$0.35 Million). To provide reliable information on the number and&#13;
identity of civil servants on the payroll, the TAP II will finance a civil service census. This exercise will&#13;
need to be coordinated to cover all ministries and public sector agencies on one day, and will involve&#13;
use of laptop computers and a number of census staff.&#13;
45.   Human Resources Information System  (US$0.60 Million).  This sub-component will&#13;
finance: the implementation of a central HRIS to monitor and control the overall management of&#13;
human resources for the central government and public sector agencies, including: (i) reconstruction of&#13;
a central civil service file; (ii) a data administrator to set up, coordinate and manage for a period of one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
to two years the link between the civil service and the payroll file of the integrated financial&#13;
management system; and (ii) corresponding computer equipment and accessories.&#13;
46.   The IRIS will be used to: (i) inventory and organize existing information on all civil service&#13;
and government contractual positions; (ii) cross-check the information against the payroll; (iii)&#13;
complete and verify the information based on the civil service census; (iv) identify and address&#13;
inconsistencies; and (v) computerize and link the central civil service file with the payroll, fiscal identity&#13;
card file, and the retirement files. This, in tum, will enable the Government to make informed decisions&#13;
on human resources management and provide a sound base for future civil service reform measures.&#13;
47.   Training pertaining to Human Resources Management (US$0.05 Million). This sub-&#13;
component wiUl provide computer and management training to take full advantage of the HRIS.&#13;
4. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
Issues&#13;
48.   Performance of State-owned Enterprises.  State ownership of a broad range of&#13;
enterprises -- including telecommunications, power, ports, financial institutions, manufacturing&#13;
enterprises and agribusiness -- has resulted in mismanagement, corruption and very poor&#13;
performance. Services are unreliable and of poor quality and operations inefficient, with poor&#13;
financial control and substantial over-staffing.&#13;
49.   The poor quality of services has undermined private sector development in Haiti and&#13;
imposed significant economic and social costs to the country. In the energy sector, no significant&#13;
new equipment has been added to the facilities of the public electricity company, while plant up-&#13;
keep has deteriorated steadily. The situation at the port of Port-au-Prince is equally serious with&#13;
weak management, antiquated equipment and excess labor redundancies leading to bottlenecks&#13;
and processing of goods and resulting in the highest tariffs in the Caribbean region.&#13;
Telecommunication services are virtually non-existent outside the capital, and Haiti has the lowest&#13;
penetration of telephone lines (0.8%) in the Caribbean and Latin America. The call completion&#13;
ratio is less than 30% on many routes, and the network is technologically obsolete. To address&#13;
these issues will require private sector involvement in management and major infusion of private&#13;
capital.&#13;
50.   Regulatory  and Legal Framework.  The regulatory framework governing most&#13;
infrastructure services is archaic and not adequate for permitting the private sector to play a&#13;
greater role. The roles and activities of the regulatory bodies are not clearly defined; in the ports&#13;
sector, for example, the publicly owned port-entity is both regulatory body, and owner of the&#13;
assets. Market entries have been restricted in several sectors, including power distribution,&#13;
telecommunications and specific port services, through monopolies granted to state-owned&#13;
enterprises. At sector levels, new frameworks allowing competition and establishing new tariffs&#13;
and concessionary policies will need to be introduced to promote private sector participation. In&#13;
parallel with its program for private sector participation in management and ownership of public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
enterprises, the Government will need to strengthen its role in monitoring, regulating, setting&#13;
policy standards, and creating enabling conditions for private sector development in areas where&#13;
competition is weak.&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
51.   To correct the mismanagement of the state-owned enterprises and improve the quality of&#13;
services, the Government intends to increase the role of the private sector through its private&#13;
sector participation program, which forms a central part of the overall economic reform effort.&#13;
This program will be carried out either by allowing private participation in ownership of state-&#13;
owned enterprises through joint ventures ("capitalization'), or by introducing private sector&#13;
management through concession or management contracts. In view of Haiti's very uneven&#13;
distribution of wealth, such a program will need to be carefully implemented to prevent undue&#13;
concentration of economic power detrimental to competition. The Government intends to attract&#13;
foreign investors, domestic savers and members of the Haitian diaspora through this program. To&#13;
enhance the equity dimension of the program, Government intends to distribute its dividend&#13;
earnings from the enterprises to local authorities. To assist in the private sector participation&#13;
program, Government has engaged the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as advisor&#13;
concerning nine key state-owned enterprises (including telecommunications, electricity and ports).&#13;
IFC's work is being funded by a US$2 million grant from USAID.&#13;
52.   A successful private sector participation program requires institutional arrangements to&#13;
manage the implementation of the program in a transparent and consistent fashion. To facilitate&#13;
coordination and speed up the program, the Government has established an implementing unit, the&#13;
state-owned enterprises democratization unit (SEDU), and a presidential decree formalizing the&#13;
role of the unit has been issued in July 1995. The SEDU, headed by a High Commissioner, is&#13;
attached to the office of the Prime Minister. The SEDU has been given the mandate to implement&#13;
the private sector participation program, with the following key tasks: (i) dissemination of&#13;
information on privatization to the public in general; (ii) supervision of passive restructuring&#13;
/measures; (iii) evaluation of divestment proposals presented to the unit by financial advisors, and&#13;
recommendation on proposed options to be presented to the Government; and (iv) compilation of&#13;
an annual report on progress. CIDA has provided a US$0.25 million grant to assist in the initial&#13;
establishment of the unit. IDB will channel technical assistance through SEDU to assist in&#13;
establishing a regulatory framework and strengthening the regulatory agency for the energy&#13;
sector.&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the TAP II&#13;
53.   To support the Government's reform  program, TAP II will finance the following&#13;
activities: (i) maintaining the unit for the implementation of the private sector participation&#13;
program (SEDU); (ii) formulating and executing a public information campaign in support of the&#13;
private sector participation program; and (iii) implementing facilitating legal and regulatory&#13;
reforms to facilitate competition and strengthening of regulatory agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
54.   State-Owned Enterprise Democratization Unit (US$1.20 Million) The SEDU staff&#13;
currently consists only of a High Commissioner and an assistant. Substantial additional technical&#13;
skills are needed to create an effective and functioning implementing agency. The TAP II will&#13;
provide technical assistance to SEDU in the following areas: (a) long-term and short term&#13;
advisors to support SEDU in the implementation of the program; (b) assistance with executing&#13;
transactions; and (c) office technology and equipment.&#13;
(a)    Long- and Short-Term Advisors (US$0.62 Million). The TAP II will finance one long-&#13;
term lead advisor to support the current High Commissioner in all aspects of his work. The lead&#13;
advisor will coordinate the work of the other domestic and foreign advisors hired under the TAP&#13;
II.  A transactions specialist will be hired to review the modalities for private participation&#13;
proposed by the financial intermediaries, and to recommend appropriate strategies to&#13;
Government. A long-term local legal advisor will be hired to provide necessary support on legal&#13;
issues related to divestment. The unit will also be provided with an environmental specialist.&#13;
Sector specialists will be financed as short-term technical advisors to provide support on sector-&#13;
specific issues.  Accountants would be recruited as short-term  financial advisors to perform&#13;
financial audits on the state-owned enterprises on the divestment list and to assist with preparation&#13;
of the divestiture of the smaller enterprises. The lead advisor and the legal advisor would also&#13;
contribute to the preparatory work for drafting necessary legislation.&#13;
(b)   Expansion of the Private Sector Development Program (US$0.55 Million). The TAP&#13;
II will finance preparatory privatization work and transactions advice on divestiture modalities for&#13;
state-owned enterprises not currently covered by IFC. This will include financial and operational&#13;
audits, preparation of options for private sector participation, and the fixed fee for the investment&#13;
advisors to undertake the transactions for four larger enterprises.&#13;
(c)    Computer and Office Equipment (US$0.03 Million). The TAP II will finance computers&#13;
and office equipment for the SEDU.&#13;
55.   Public Information Campaign (US$0.70 Million). The TAP II will finance a full time&#13;
public information advisor as well as short term experts to assist in identifying public perceptions&#13;
of the private sector participation program, and in developing a communications strategy to&#13;
effectively disseminate the proposed private sector participation program.  The proposed&#13;
assistance consists of four basic components: (a) design, development and implementation of a&#13;
communications strategy; (b) design, production and dissemination of information; (c) supporting&#13;
research and development; and (d) preparation of seminars, training and conferences on private&#13;
sector participation.&#13;
(a)    Communications Strategy (US$0.05 Million). The advisor will develop and implement a&#13;
comprehensive communications strategy for the private sector participation program, consisting&#13;
of sector, national and international campaigns. The sector and national campaigns will serve to&#13;
educate stake-holders and the public at large about the benefits of the program and aim at building&#13;
broad-based support. The international campaign will assist in marketing the private sector&#13;
participation program and to-be privatized enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
(b)   Information Materials (US$0.40 Million) The advisor will be directly responsible for&#13;
budgeting, overseeing and coordinating the design, production and dissemination of information&#13;
to support the communications strategy through various media, including television, radio and&#13;
print.&#13;
(c)    Research and Development (US$0.05 Million). The advisor will assess knowledge and&#13;
perceptions of the general public and major shareholders regarding the private sector participation&#13;
program. The data will be analyzed to evaluate and enhance effectiveness of the components of&#13;
the public information campaign. This work will include collection of qualitative and quantitative&#13;
data through focus groups and surveys.&#13;
(d)   Seminars, Training and Conferences (US$0.20 Million).  The advisor will organize&#13;
special events to educate major stakeholders about the private sector participation program. Such&#13;
events might include seminars for members of the Parliament, seminars and training programs for&#13;
key public officials, and seminars for employees of enterprises participating in the private sector&#13;
participation program.&#13;
56.   Legal and Regulatory Reforms (US$1.10 Million). The TAP II will finance, in parallel&#13;
with the implementation of the private sector participation program for utilities, the preparation of&#13;
corresponding reforms in the legal and regulatory environment to facilitate competition and&#13;
private sector development. The proposed assistance will include: (a) reviewing the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework for the utilities; and (b) strengthening regulatory agencies.&#13;
(a)   Legal and Regulatory Framewvork (US$0.45 Million). The TAP II will finance legal and&#13;
regulatory reforms in the electricity, telecommunications, maritime ports and airports sectors to&#13;
foster private sector development in these sectors. This work will be carried out in cooperation&#13;
with sector task-forces that are being formed, including Haitian experts and ministerial&#13;
representatives. Regulation covering the entry and exit, pricing, investment and quality standards&#13;
will be reviewed by a legal and regulatory reform advisor, and new legislation drafted where&#13;
required. Environmental issues will be taken into consideration in the drafting. Where activities&#13;
are undertaken by IFC or other investment advisors, the legal advisor will review the work and&#13;
coordinate it on behalf of SEDU to ensure consistency across sectors.&#13;
(b)   Regulatory Agencies (US$0.65 Million).  The TAP II will finance strengthening&#13;
regulatory agencies for the utilities included in the private sector participation program. The&#13;
obstacles and the time required to establish functioning regulatory agencies should not be&#13;
underestimated in a country which does not have a regulatory tradition, and where regulation can&#13;
conflict with powerful vested interests. Accordingly, the regulatory and legal advisor will propose&#13;
strategies and implement measures that take into account the current weak implementation&#13;
capacity of the regulatory bodies. This work should conform with the sector strategies and&#13;
divestiture modalities developed by IFC. The specific activities will include: (i) organizing and&#13;
staffing of the regulatory agencies, and procedures; (ii) developing a framework and defining&#13;
responsibilities for regulatory agencies that would be effective in the Haitian context; (iii)&#13;
preparing twinning arrangements with regulatory agencies in other countries; (iv) providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -                          Technical Annex&#13;
training in technical and legal aspects of regulations; and (v) supporting the pilot execution of&#13;
regulatory functions (shadow management).&#13;
5. PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION&#13;
Issues&#13;
57.    The public sector in Haiti is very weak, and the challenge facing the Government in improving&#13;
its performance is enormous. The objectives of the public sector are not well defined, its structure&#13;
anachronistic, its staff demotivated, and its procedures not suited for supporting a modem market-&#13;
oriented economy and society. In this context, the Government recognizes that the main issues that it&#13;
needs to address include (i) redefining the role of the public sector to better meet the development&#13;
needs of the country; (ii) raising the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service in the delivery of&#13;
basic services to the public; and (iii) creating an enabling environment for private sector development.&#13;
58.    Specifically, public sector modernization evolves around six broad tasks: first, defining clearly&#13;
the new role of the public sector, and accordingly reorienting and reducing the scope of public sector&#13;
activities; second, improving the quality of the public service, thirat modernizing and integrating&#13;
human resources and -fi-nancial management functions; fourth, implementing administrative reforms,&#13;
including institutional reordering, and rationalization and simplification of procedures and key tasks;&#13;
fifth1, pursuing administrative and financial decentralization and the strengthening of basic municipal&#13;
management; and sixth, updating the legal framework governing the operations of the public sector and&#13;
its relations to the private sector.&#13;
59.    Accomplishing these tasks will be critical for the ability of the public sector to gain legitimacy&#13;
and effectively address social concerns and help support private-sector-led growth. While this will be a&#13;
long-term effort, it is important to begin laying the foundations for its successful implementation and&#13;
initiate key reform measures.&#13;
Thte Government's Reform Program&#13;
60.    The Government has repeatedly expressed its interest and commitment to initiate a&#13;
comprehensive public sector reform. Its main objectives are to (i) strengthen the weak institutional&#13;
capacity of the executive, legislative and judicial branches to deliver services; and, thereby, (ii) improve&#13;
the living conditions of the Haitian people and reinforce their confidence in a modem, market-oriented&#13;
and democratic state.&#13;
61.    To support the Government's reform program, UNDP has agreed to launch a US$12 million&#13;
project which aims to strengthen executive, legislative and judicial capacities, including through pilot&#13;
activities at the municipal level, logistical support for parliament, and technical assistance to the&#13;
judiciary. USAID is providing technical assistance through a US$5 million Policy Administrative&#13;
Reform (PAR) project, which includes the recruitment of qualified staff for key technical positions.&#13;
IDB is supporting decentralization with a US$2. 1 million technical assistance component. At the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -                         Technical Annex&#13;
time, the Govemment has requested IDA participation in the area of public sector reform, in particular&#13;
in the preparation of a public sector modernization action plan (PSMAP), which will provide a&#13;
framework and help coordinate the reform activities.  The PSMAP will also serve to lay the&#13;
foundations for a proposed Third Economic Recovery Credit, envisioned for FY98.&#13;
Proposed Assistance Under The TAP IH&#13;
62.   To support the Government's reform  program, the public sector modernization component&#13;
of the TAP II will finance the following activities: (i) preparing the PSMAP; (ii) providing training&#13;
for senior officials; and (iii) conducting a service delivery survey.&#13;
63.   Public Sector Modernization Action Plan (US$0.65 Million). The TAP II will finance&#13;
technical and advisory services to the Government for preparing the PSMAP, which will provide the&#13;
analytical basis for Government to design and implement a public sector modernization program.&#13;
Ultimately, such a program will cover the following areas: (a) reaching a consensus on the role of the&#13;
public sector, (b) public service reform; (c) public administration reform, including institutional&#13;
reordering, and rationalization and simplification of procedures and key tasks; (d) administrative and&#13;
financial decentralization and the strengthening of basic municipal management; and (e) updating of the&#13;
legal framework goveming the operations of the public sector.&#13;
64.   The preparation of the PSMAP will be directed from the Office of the Prime Minister, with&#13;
active participation of, in particular, the Ministries of Finance, Interior, and Planning. It is expected to&#13;
be initiated following the presidential elections, to continue the policy dialogue with the new&#13;
Government.&#13;
65.   The proposed assistance for the PSMAP will include the provision of: (i) a lead consultant with&#13;
proven international experience and the capacity for intellectual leadership at a high level, whose&#13;
primary responsibility will be to lead Government efforts in the preparation of the PSMAP and the&#13;
coordination of public sector improvements included in projects supported by other donors; and (ii)&#13;
experienced consultancy services to undertake (a) functional reviews of selected ministries; and (b)&#13;
studies pertaining to the areas to be covered under the reform program. This will be complemented by&#13;
studies undertaken in the context of the other components of the TAP II.&#13;
66.   Training for Senior Officials (US$0.40 Million). The preparation of the PSMAP will be&#13;
supported by workshops and seminars to build ownership and commitment to public sector&#13;
modernization at all levels of government and within the wider political and economic decision-making&#13;
arena. The proposed assistance for the training program will include the provision of specialists with&#13;
intemational experience and materials.&#13;
67.   Service Delivery Survey (US$0.05 Million). To assess strengths and weaknesses of the&#13;
public sector and establish performance benchmarks, a service delivery survey for selected sectors will&#13;
be commissioned in the later stages of the implementation of the public sector modernization&#13;
component. The findings of this survey will feed into the fine-tuning of strategies and actions under the&#13;
PSMAP. The proposed assistance for this sub-component will include the provision of a qualified&#13;
consultancy firm.&#13;

68.   Finally, dialogue with the donor community will be pursued in order to identify a possible&#13;
partner for a large-scale training of mid-level officials in key economic, technical and management&#13;
skills.&#13;
6. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENT&#13;
69.   Implementation  Support (US$1.60 Million). This component will support the&#13;
programming and planning unit in the Ministry of Finance responsible for overseeing the project.&#13;
In particular, the unit will be responsible for procurement of goods and services and facilitating&#13;
disbursements for all activities of the TAP II, except for the private sector development&#13;
component, where this responsibility will rest with the SEDU. Specifically, the TAP II will&#13;
finance the following activities: (a) financing of a project manager; (b) hiring of an international&#13;
procurement advisor backed by a procurement agency; (c) providing procurement training for&#13;
counterpart staff, (d) procuring computer and office equipment; and (e) covering incremental&#13;
operating costs associated with the TAP II. In addition, USS$0.5 million of this component are&#13;
allocated to refund activities related to employment generation financed under a  Project&#13;
Preparation Facility, which have now been integrated in the IDA-financed Employment&#13;
Generation Project (Credit No.2765-HA).&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
70.   The TAP II will finance the cost of consultant services, training, information technology,&#13;
equipment and incremental operating costs to support the implementation of the Government's&#13;
economic reform program. Total costs for the technical assistance program for the three areas&#13;
addressed by the TAP II -- public finance, privatization and public sector modernization -- are&#13;
estimated at US$58.2 million equivalent. The US$12.0 million equivalent IDA Credit will finance&#13;
approximately 21 percent of these costs. The balance will be funded by expected and committed&#13;
financing for the program includes contributions by CIDA (US$0.25 million), IDB (US$13.67&#13;
million), IMF (US$0.36 million), Japan (US$5.0 million), UNDP (US$18.7 million) and USAID&#13;
(US$7.0 million). The Government will provide counterpart financing of US$1.20 million, for&#13;
counterpart staff, local consultants, equipment, office space, supplies, secretarial services, vehicle&#13;
operation and training support costs. Approximately US$7.3 million of the IDA Credit will be&#13;
allocated to consultant services, US$1.6 million for equipment, US$0.6 million for works&#13;
(aerophotography), US$1.3 million for training, US$0.6 million for incremental operating costs&#13;
and US$0.6 million for contingencies.&#13;

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
71.   Implementation of the TAP II directly involves the following Government offices and&#13;
agencies:&#13;
(i)    Office of the Prime Minister, including the Technical Secretariat for Private Sector&#13;
Participation in Public Enterprises (currently, the state-owned enterprises democratization&#13;
unit: SEDU), for the private sector development and public sector modernization&#13;
components.&#13;
(ii)   Ministry of Finance, including the tax administration (DGI) and the National Land&#13;
Registry, for property tax reform, expenditure management and human resources&#13;
management;&#13;
(iii)   Ministry of Planning, for expenditure management, specifically the budgeting and&#13;
monitoring of capital expenditures;&#13;
(iv)   Cour des Comptes (the national auditing office), for expenditure management,&#13;
specifically the strengthening of audit functions.&#13;
72.   The proposed implementation arrangements are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Office of the Prime Minister.  The Office of the Prime Minister would house the&#13;
representative(s) of a recognized consulting firm with experience in the design of public&#13;
sector modernization programs. The role of the Office of the Prime Minister would be to&#13;
lead a government and nation wide dialogue, with analytical support by the consulting firm&#13;
develop a public sector modernization strategy and action plan.  Procurement and&#13;
disbursement for this task would be managed from the project implementation unit in the&#13;
Ministry of Finance.&#13;
The Technical Secretariat for Private Sector Participation would manage all activities&#13;
related to the private sector development program. While the Technical Secretariat could&#13;
draw on support by the project implementation unit, it is expected to develop an in-house&#13;
capacity for procurement and disbursement, and to extend assistance to other agencies&#13;
affected by the private sector participation process. Currently, SEDU has been assigned&#13;
the role of Technical Secretariat.&#13;
(ii)   Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance would house the project implementation&#13;
unit, responsible for supervision, procurement and disbursement of the overall TAP II&#13;
with the exception of (i) above. The unit would include a local project manager and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -                       Technical Annex&#13;
procurement advisor from a recognized procurement agency (possibly seconded by UNDP&#13;
to facilitate coordination with the IMF/UNDP project, but solely accountable to the&#13;
Ministry and IDA).  The Ministry of Finance would also house the advisors and&#13;
consultants responsible for assisting in the design of the management information system&#13;
and the accounting and budgeting framework for the expenditure management&#13;
componenit. It would further be responsible for the human resources management system&#13;
componient, including the civil service census and the implementation of the central civil&#13;
service file.&#13;
DGI would house the experts for the property tax reform.  All procurement and&#13;
disbursement would be arranged through the project implementation unit. The National&#13;
Land Registry would be responsible for the creation of the land register.&#13;
(iii) Ministry of Planning. The Ministry of Planning would benefit from the extension of the&#13;
management information system  to integrate the budget planning functions of the&#13;
Ministries of Planning and Finance. It would also house an expert on public sector&#13;
investment planning to complement support by UNDP. Procurement and disbursement&#13;
would rest with the project implementation unit.&#13;
(iv)   Cour des Comptes. The Cour des Comptes will house an accounting and auditing&#13;
specialist and benefit from training. The expert should be provided by the same consulting&#13;
firm working for the Ministry of Finance. Procurement and disbursement would rest with&#13;
the project implementation unit.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
73.   The works, goods and services to be financed under the project will be procured in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines or other procedures acceptable to IDA. The contract for&#13;
aerophotography works for the property tax reform component will be awarded by International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts for goods (vehicles, computer equipment and software)&#13;
valued at US$50,000 equivalent or more will be awarded through Limited International Bidding&#13;
(LIB) for an estimated amount of US$500,000 equivalent. LIB procedures are justified given the&#13;
small number of providers with after-delivery service in Haiti. Standard IDA bidding documents&#13;
would be used for LIB. Contracts for goods and equipment with estimated values of less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000 equivalent will be awarded&#13;
using international shopping procedures; and contracts for goods and equipment (office furniture&#13;
and supplies) for a value of less than US$5,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$20,000 equivalent will be awarded through local shopping. All procurement for training and&#13;
consultant services under the various components would be in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
All procurement of goods above US$50,000, all terms of reference for consultants, all contracts&#13;
for critical assignments and all consultancy contracts above US$50,000 for firms and above&#13;
US$25,000 for individuals will be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -                        Technical Annex&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
74.   The project is expected to be implemented over a five year period. Disbursements will be&#13;
administered by the project unit. All withdrawal applications will be fully documented, except for&#13;
expenditures under contracts for goods valued below US$50,000 equivalent, individual consultant&#13;
contracts valued at or below US$25,000 equivalent, and consultant firm contracts valued at or&#13;
below US$50,000 equivalent which will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs), for which detailed documentation evidencing expenditures will be retained by the project&#13;
unit and made available for review by auditors and by IDA staff Retroactive financing in an&#13;
amount of US$1.0 million equivalent, approximately 8 percent of the Credit, will be available for&#13;
eligible expenditures incurred after July 27, 1995. This financing will cover the cost of additional&#13;
diagnostic work and project start-up activities. A Special Account in US dollars will be opened in&#13;
the central bank, with an authorized allocation of US$750,000 equivalent. An amount of&#13;
US$250,000 will be released upon credit effectiveness and an amount of US$3 million will have&#13;
to be reached before the borrower has access to the total authorized allocation.&#13;
AUDITS&#13;
75.   The project unit will maintain records and accounts of all transactions relating to the TAP&#13;
II, with the exception of records and accounts pertaining to the component executed by the&#13;
SEDU. All records and accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory&#13;
to IDA. Statement of expenses (SOEs), audit reports of project accounts, and the financial&#13;
statements themselves would be provided to IDA within six months of the end of each Haitian&#13;
fiscal year. The first report would be due March 31, 1998, for the fiscal year ending September&#13;
30, 1997.&#13;
REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
76.   The project unit will be responsible for monitoring project progress and for preparing&#13;
quarterly progress reports, satisfactory to IDA, which will briefly evaluate the progress of&#13;
implementation up to date, starting in December 1996. The reports will be reviewed by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and submitted to IDA within 30 days. There will be joint annual reviews,&#13;
under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, by end-September of each year, beginning in 1997.&#13;
The expected project completion date is December 31, 2001 and the Credit closing date would be&#13;
June 30, 2002. An implementation completion report will be prepared by the Government and&#13;
submitted to IDA no later than December 331, 2002.&#13;

SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Schedule 2: Training Plan&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Training will constitute a key activity under the TAP II. A total of US$1.26&#13;
million, about 10 percent of the total Credit amount, will be allocated to formal training&#13;
activities. These take the form of seminars, workshops, study tours and staff exchange.&#13;
In addition, there will be important on-the-job training activities integrated into the project&#13;
components.&#13;
SUMMARY OF TRAINING ACTIVITIES&#13;
1. PROPERTY TAX REFORM COMPONENT&#13;
2.    Success of any reform on property tax administration would depend to a great&#13;
extent on imparting proper training to its staff. With this objective in view, the TAP II&#13;
would finance appropriate training programs to managers, technicians and administrative&#13;
personnel at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGI) and at the National Land Registry&#13;
to improve their professional skills and efficiency and there by increase significantly the&#13;
performance of these institutions. The budget for training under this component amounts&#13;
to US$0. 15 million; training activities are scheduled to extend from the second quarter of&#13;
1997 to the first quarter of 1999.&#13;
3.    Consultants financed under the Project would design and structure specialized&#13;
training programs in mapping, valuation, collection, appeals, audit and enforcement for&#13;
staff involved in these specialized areas. A suggested curriculum for the general training&#13;
program would include: (i) theory and practice of the valuation of residential property and&#13;
commercial and industrial property; (ii) building attributes and practices; (iii) elements of&#13;
surveying and referencing for valuation purposes; (iv) use of computer systems; and (v)&#13;
tax collection, appeals, audit and enforcement.&#13;
2. EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
4.    A key objective of the expenditure management training program  will be to&#13;
upgrade and deepen the analytical skills of mid and higher level staff of the Ministries of&#13;
Finance and Planning in accounting, auditing, public sector investment programming, and&#13;
issues relating to the public debt. Development of course material and initial delivery of&#13;
training would constitute an important task of each of the long-term residential advisory&#13;
teams proposed to be retained under the project. Training would also benefit the Cour des&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -                     Technical Annex&#13;

Coniples. The budget for training under this component amounts to US$0.42 million;&#13;
training activities are scheduled to extend from the second quarter of 1997 to the third&#13;
quarter of 1999.&#13;
5.    In accounting, a significant amount of resources will be devoted to training in data&#13;
entry and use of the to-be-installed double entry accounting system. Training as well as&#13;
study tours to relevant public administrations in the Americas will also be provided.&#13;
6.    In auditing, training will be devoted to familiarizing auditors in the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and the Coul des Con;pwes with modern standards in internal and external&#13;
auditing, and to facilitate application of the operational audit manuals that would be&#13;
prepared by the technical advisors.&#13;
7.    As public investment programming and provision of macro-economics indicators&#13;
assume a certain level of skills in macroeconomics, the public investment advisor will&#13;
provide training in macro-econiomiiics projections, project evaluation, financial analysis for&#13;
selected staff in the Ministry of Planning and the line ministries.&#13;
8.    Training in debt management will involve instructions in the application of&#13;
software for debt management. External training will also be arranged with the World&#13;
Bank and other private financial institutions.&#13;
9.    The organization of training interventions will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Planning and the Couir des Comptes, assisted by the project&#13;
implementation unit and the long-term advisors. The effective coordination of tasks&#13;
involved in the design, adminiistration and financing of training interventions will be key to&#13;
the sustainability of this component.&#13;
3. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COMPONENT&#13;
10.   Training and educational activities under the human resources management system&#13;
component will cover Ministry of Finance staff in the areas of use of information systems&#13;
and personnel management. The budget for training under this component amounts to&#13;
US$0.05 million; training activities are scheduled to extend from the third quarter of 1997&#13;

resources management as well as the rudiments of public accounting and budget. Public&#13;
and private institutions of higher learning would be contracted to provide experienced&#13;
teachers. Training will be scheduled over a period of 20 months following the census.&#13;
The budgeted costs are $45,000.&#13;
4. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
13.   Lessons of experience from  other countries have demonstrated that broad&#13;
educational programs disseminating information on the objectives, approaches and&#13;
potential outcomes of privatization are crucial for successful implementation. Under this&#13;
component, staff within SEDU will be trained on privatization techniques and familiarized&#13;
with international best practices, and the various groups of stakeholders (parliament, labor&#13;
unions, non-governmental oroianizations, the media, government and private sector) and&#13;
potential investors will be educated on the objectives, approaches and potential outcomes&#13;
of the Government of Haiti's  private sector participation program.  The budget for&#13;
training under this component amounts to US$0.20 million (excluding activities under the&#13;
public information campaign); training activities are scheduled to extend from the fourth&#13;
quarter of 1996 to the third quarter of 1999.&#13;
14.   Tar,geted wi,orkshiops oni pr'ivatizalionJ will be designed as a vehicle to disseminate&#13;
information on the Government's private sector participation program to several segments&#13;
of the Haitian society. The workshops would be tailored to respond to the particular&#13;
concerns of the various groLups involved. The objective of the workshops would be to&#13;
inform the participants oni the rationale, objectives, scope, methodology and expected&#13;
outcomes of Haiti's private sector participation program, and to provide a forum for&#13;
questions and feedback. As part of the training program, a team of Haitians delivering the&#13;
workshops across the country would be trained on privatization concepts by international&#13;
privatization experts.&#13;
15.   Privatization of those state enterprises that are not currently corporatized, will&#13;
require an approval by the Parliament.  Under this component (a) .semintatrs will be&#13;
organized to the newly elected parliamenit to educate them on rationale of privatization&#13;
and what role it could play in a country's economic growth strategy, and to disseminate&#13;
details on outcomes of past experiences on privatization transactions in other countries;&#13;
and (b) stuidy tours will be organized to selected members of parliament to countries that&#13;
have implemented extensive divestiture programs, including for infrastructure.&#13;
16.   Traitiinsg  oni plri'cizaltioni techniques; company  valuation  methodologies;&#13;
corporate finance and financial markets will be provided to SEDU staff both by the&#13;
external advisers recruited under the TAP II, and by external training institutes. SEDU&#13;
staff will participate on stucdy tours to countries which have implemented innovative&#13;
privatization schelmles.&#13;
17.   Ncailloncil coqJlreULce  o/7 privalization  will be organized  prior to  major&#13;
transactions, to educate and inform the general public on the specific characteristics of the&#13;

Schedule 2&#13;
sale. International press conferences and road shows will be organized to attract potential&#13;
foreign investors.&#13;
18.   As part of the privatization process, the role of the state in the utilities sectors will&#13;
be redefined, and the legal and regulatory framework revised.   As the current&#13;
implementation capability within Haiti on legal and regulatory issues is extremely limited,&#13;
the TAP II finance training oni techniical anid legal aspects of regullation1s, specifically on&#13;
those related to concession contract enforcement and monitoring, and resolution of&#13;
disputes. Twining arrangements with regulatory institutions in other countries will be&#13;
arranged as part of the TAP II training program.&#13;
5. PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION COMPONENT&#13;
19.   The transformation of behaviors and attitudes and the building of capacities will&#13;
form an important part of the effort to modernize Haiti's public sector. Training activities&#13;
carried out under the project will include (i) awareness raising workshops on issues of&#13;
good policy anid strsategic pl/aning for senior public sector officials and decision makers&#13;
(including parliamentarians); (ii) training of mid-level public sector managers, technical&#13;
and administrative staff on improved petfornmance and service delivery in the pllblic&#13;
sector; and (iii) capacil. bilding for jouirnialisis on issues of public sector management&#13;
and good governance. Training interventions will constitute a key vehicle for building&#13;
ownership and internal support for sustaining performance improvement in public sector&#13;
institutions. The budget for training under this component amounts to USSO.40 million;&#13;
training activities are scheduled to extend from the third quarter of 1997 to the third&#13;
quarter of 1998.&#13;
20.   The training interventions for public sector modernization are structured around&#13;
four core modules: (i) senior policy interventions for decision-makers on Haiti's vision for&#13;
the public sector and its translation into reality in the medium term; (ii) seminar series for&#13;
mid-level career civil servants on (a) vision and implementation strategy for the PSMAP,&#13;
(b) performance evaluation and planning, (c) public expenditure planning and&#13;
management, and (d) institutional re-ordering; (iii) a seminar series aimed at launching a&#13;
structured dialogue between the public sector and the public at large on strategies for&#13;
improving the provision of basic services to the public, and (iv) seminars on investigative&#13;
journalism to enhance the professionalism and analytical capacity of Haitian journalists to&#13;
address issues of public sector management and good governance.&#13;
21.   Each of the above modules will be developed and carried out in coordination with&#13;
the expenditure management and human resources management system components under&#13;
the TAP II. Development of course material, including the design and management of&#13;
teleconference and audio-visual sessions, would constitute an important task of the long-&#13;
term residential advisors. The overall organization of training interventions will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Office of the Prime Minister in corporation with the Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;

            The Second Technical Assistance Project
            will: 1) strengthen the Haitian government's capacity
            to design and implement priority policy reforms in the areas
            of public finances and privatization; and 2) provide the
            analytical base for further structural adjustment measures
            with focus on public sector modernization, which will be
            implemented over the next several years. The project will
            also provide complementary finance for consultants, goods
            and services, including training and dissemination of
            information to the public, and incremental operating costs.

            information to advance its economic reform program and
            sustain the actions envisioned under the Second Economic
            Recovery Credit. Specifically, the project will cover the
            areas of public finances, private sector development and
            public sector modernization through the following
            components: 1) property tax reform; 2) expenditure
            management; 3) human resources management system; 4) private
            sector development; 5) public sector modernization; and 6)
