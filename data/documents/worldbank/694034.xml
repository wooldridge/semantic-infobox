PAKISTAN&#13;
NATIONAL DRAINAGE PROGRAM (NDP) PROJECT&#13;
1. THE CRISIS IN IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE&#13;
A. THE INDUS BASIN IRRIGATION SYSTEM&#13;
1.1    Overall Economic Performance: Pakistan's economy has grown rapidly in the last decade.&#13;
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 5.1% annually from 1986 to 1996. Strong agricultural&#13;
performance (annual growth: 4.1% from 1986 to 1996; 5.3% in 1996; 6.6% in 1995) and an enterprising&#13;
private sector have been the main factors in Pakistan's growth record. Pakistan is however still a relatively&#13;
poor country with per capita income of $490 in 1996. The Borrower's primary objectives in the medium-&#13;
term are to increase per-capita income and to alleviate poverty. Major challenges are improving social&#13;
services and improving management of natural resources and the environment inter alia by: (i) redefning&#13;
the roles of the public and private sectors to get the public sector out of tasks which can be more efficiently&#13;
performed by the private sector; (ii) restructuring public expenditures and key public sector institutions to&#13;
ensure that the restructured public sector is able to carry out its legitimate role in an efficient and cost-&#13;
effective manner; and (iii) building the capacities of key public sector institutions to equip them for newly&#13;
defined roles.&#13;
1.2    Role of Agriculture: Agriculture accounts for more than 25 percent of GDP, more than 50&#13;
percent of employment, and (directly or indirectly) 70 percent of export revenues. It has a central role in&#13;
alleviating poverty, given the concentration of the poor in rural areas; and in protecting the environment,&#13;
given that agriculture is the primary user of natural resources. Agriculture contributes significantly to all&#13;
other sectors and is the main engine of growth for the economy. Pakistan's agriculture depends heavily on&#13;
irrigation, which covers 79 percent of the total cropped area of 20.8 million hectares (51 million acres).&#13;
Irrigated agriculture in turn is by far the dominant user of available water supply, accounting for 98 percent&#13;
of direct flows and the bulk of re-flows.&#13;
1.3    The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS): The irrigation system of Pakistan is the largest&#13;
integrated irrigation network in the world. The system is fed by the waters of the Indus River and its&#13;
tributaries. Since 1947, Pakistan implemented the Indus Basin Replacement Works Project (IBRWP) with&#13;
the Bank's help as the lead donor. Under the IBRWP, 39.54 million acres were brought under irrigation.&#13;
The salient features of the system are three major storage reservoirs, namely Tarbela and Chashma on&#13;
River Indus, and Mangla on River Jhelum; 19 barrages; 12 inter-river link canals; 43 independent irrigation&#13;
canal commands; and over 107,000 watercourses; which are complemented with a surface drainage system&#13;
comparable in size. The length of canals totals 61,000 kms, and in addition watercourses, farm channels,&#13;
and field ditches cover another 1.6 million kms. Typical watercourse commands range from 80 to 320&#13;
hectares. The flows to the Indus are from Himalayan glacier and snow melt, as well as from rainfall outside&#13;
the Indus Plain. Diversion of river waters into offtaking canals is made through barrages which are gated&#13;
diversion weirs. The main canals in turn deliver water to branch canals, distributaries, and minors. The&#13;
watercourses get their share of water through outlets in the irrigation channels. Distribution of water from&#13;
a watercourse is effected through a time-share (rotation system) which is locally referred to as&#13;
"warabandi" under which each farm gets water for a specified period. The time-share or "warn" is&#13;
proportionate to the farm area owned by a farmer under a command of the watercourse. The system draws&#13;
an average of 106 Million Acre Feet (MAF) of surface water each year for irrigation, supplemented by an&#13;
annual groundwater pumpage of some 43 MAF. The average depth of water available at the farm level is&#13;
3.07 feet per acre. Approximately 3 million individual farms with an average size of about 12 acres benefit&#13;
from this system. Average inflows and water use are summarized below:&#13;

1.4    Most system losses are due to canal and watercourse seepage, since practically the entire network&#13;
is unlined. In addition to river diversions, 48 billion cubic meters are pumped annually from groundwater&#13;
by about 13,500 public and about 400,000 private tubewells. Much of this is recovery from system losses&#13;
due to seepage in areas underlain by fresh groundwater aquifers. Seepage in areas underlain by saline&#13;
groundwater aquifers is completely lost to irrigation. Although non-agriculture users extract 5.3 billion&#13;
cubic meters from the system annually, 80 percent of the extraction returns to the system, albeit with&#13;
degraded quality. The water requirement for non-agricultural uses is expected to increase from the&#13;
equivalent of 4% of the surface water diverted for irrigated agriculture at present to about 10-15% within&#13;
the next 25 years. Most of this water will return to the system, but with a degraded quality. This will in the&#13;
long term mean unacceptable water quality in the middle and lower reaches of the Indus River and the&#13;
areas that depend on these reaches for irrigation and domestic water supply. It will also eventually threaten&#13;
the water supply of Karachi, a city with more than 10 million inhabitants at the outfall of the Indus River,&#13;
and many of the 25 internationally recognized wetlands in the Indus Basin.&#13;
B. THE DRAINAGE CRISIS&#13;
1.5    The Need for Drainage: An effective and efficient drainage system is essential to sustain&#13;
environmentally-sound irrigated agriculture. The aquifer on which the IBIS is overlaid averages 3000 feet&#13;
deep and is completely unified. The Indus Basin has flat topography, porous soils, and semi-arid climate&#13;
with high evaporation. In such an enviromnent, irrigation without drainage leads inevitably to rising&#13;
watertables and eventual salinity. Yet even under these circumstances, it is possible, and economically&#13;
rational, to postpone the provision of drainage while expanding the irrigation network. This is what&#13;
Pakistan chose to do.&#13;
1.6    Results of Drainage Programs: Since 1960, Pakistan has been implementing an ambitious&#13;
program of Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs: 51 projects to date), the scope of which is&#13;
summarized in the table below.&#13;

1.7    The Drainage Network: Unlike the irrigation network, which is contiguous, Pakistan's drainage&#13;
network is by sharp contrast not interconnected. Much of the drainage effluent is either retained in the&#13;
IBIS or disposed into the rivers and canals. The drainage solutions which Pakistan has so far applied to the&#13;
problem have been slow to stem the rising tide of waterlogging and salinity. Furtler, most of the drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
effluent which is generated is retained or recycled within the basin, as noted above. The consequence of&#13;
operating a vast, inefficient, and interconnected irrigation system for decades first without drainage, and&#13;
then later interwoven with an inefficient, inadequate and discontinuous drainage system has been the&#13;
gradual rising of the watertable and associated salinity. The loss of agricultural land to waterlogging and&#13;
salinity substantially exceeds the amount of new land brought under irrigation expansion schemes during&#13;
the same period.&#13;
1.8     Magnitude of the Crisis: Waterlogging and salinity are the principal threats to the sustainability&#13;
of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan: 37.6 percent of the Gross Commanded Area (GCA) is waterlogged', of&#13;
which 15 percent is severely waterlogged2. 14 percent of the surface is saline3, of which 6 percent is&#13;
severely saline4. The watertable in the Indus Plain was deeper than 90 feet at the turn of the century. By&#13;
1961, it was shallower than 10 feet in 38 percent of the area; by 1981 it was shallower than 10 feet in 45&#13;
percent of the area; and by 1989 it was shallower than 5 feet in 15 percent of the area. While the&#13;
watertable is declining rapidly in most Fresh Groundwater (FGW) areas (the watertable declined from 11.7&#13;
feet in 1988 to 23.3 feet in 1995; and is declining by up to 5 feet p.a. in some areas, and 2.1 feet p.a. in&#13;
Punjab), it is still increasing in some Saline Groundwater (SGW) areas5. Between 1978 and 1989, the area&#13;
with watertable shallower than 5 feet (pre-Monsoon) increased from 4.8 million acres to 5.9 million acres.&#13;
The area provided with drainage in which the watertable rose also increased from 0.925 million acres in&#13;
1988 to 1.3 million acres in 19916. Salinity is also increasing: in SGW areas, salinity remains at the very&#13;
high level of 3,900-4,000 parts per million (PPM); and in FGW areas, salinity is estimated to have&#13;
increased from 900 PPM in 1988 to 940 PPM in 1995. The twin problems of waterlogging and salinity are&#13;
most severe in Sindh Province (Lower Indus Plain), where more than half of the waterlogged and salinity&#13;
affected areas are located.  There, the watertable is less than 8 feet deep in 37 percent of the areas, 56&#13;
percent of the area is moderately saline, and 32.5 percent is severely so. The area requiring drainage in the&#13;
near future, inclusive of completed and ongoing project areas, is estimated at 19.16 million acres, of which&#13;
5.84 million acres are covered under ongoing projects, 2.22 million acres are in areas with completed&#13;
projects requiring further rehabilitation, and 11.1 million acres have no drainage.&#13;
1.9    Impact of Waterlogging and Salinity: The rise of groundwater tables to near the surface in SGW&#13;
areas, and the consequent soil salinization became, and continue to be, serious environmental problems&#13;
associated with irrigation in the Indus Basin. The impact of salinity on agricultural productivity is severe: a&#13;
25 percent reduction in the production of Pakistan's major crops is attributed by many experts and the&#13;
Borrower to soil salinity alone7. In Sindh Province where the problem is much more severe, the Borrower&#13;
estimates that the impact may be closer to 40-60 percent in SGW areas. The critical threshold at which&#13;
salinity begins to affect the productivity of agricultural land varies by crop. Similarly, the impacts of&#13;
waterlogging on yields are startling. High groundwater tables inhibit root growth and therefore reduce crop&#13;
yields. As the depth to watertable decreases to within 5 feet, yields of all major crops begin to decline&#13;
rapidly. At 0 to 0.8 feet depth-to-watertable, yields are 2 percent for cotton, 9 percent for sugar, and 21&#13;
1       Defined as area with watertable shallower than 10 feet below the surface. The critical threshold at which the&#13;
watertable begins to affect the productivity of agricultural land is about 8 feet below the surface.&#13;
2       Defined as area with watertable shallower than 5 feet below the surface. Irrigated agriculture is only&#13;
marginally viable at this level of watertable, especially when combined with excessive salinity.&#13;

4&#13;
percent for wheat. In addition, there are serious environmental and poverty impacts associated with&#13;
waterlogging and salinity.&#13;
1.10    The Current Disposal Strategy: 24 million of the 33 million tons of salt which are brought into&#13;
the basin annually are retained and recycled within it: (i) 2.2 million tons are stored in evaporation ponds in&#13;
Cholistan Desert; (ii) 2.6 million tons are stored in Pakistan's largest inland freshwater lakes (Manchar and&#13;
Hammal) on the Right Bank Indus; (iii) 0.7 million tons are trapped in the Peshawar Valley; and (iv) 18.5&#13;
million tons are stored in the aquifer through direct seepage from canals, watercourses, and drains. The&#13;
rest is disposed into the Arabian Sea via the Lower Indus River itself. This means that salinity levels&#13;
increase rapidly as extraction of irrigation supplies increases in the Lower Indus. But in addition to&#13;
distributing river supplied salt, additional salts are mobilized directly onto the surface (and retained) in&#13;
FGW areas due to tubewell irrigation.&#13;
1.11    Drainage Options for Pakistan: Pakistan has three basic options for dealing with its drainage&#13;
problem. The first option is to dispose the drainage effluent outside the IBIS. The second option is to&#13;
minimize the drainage effluent by changing the chemistry of drain water, either through dilution and re-&#13;
use, or through concentration and separation of dissolved salts for subsequent disposal. The third option is&#13;
to prevent or reduce the volume of drainable surplus through source control. The options are not mutually&#13;
exclusive. Each of these options must meet the criteria of completeness (the extent to which they can be&#13;
implemented alone or they rely on other options), effectiveness (the extent to which they solve the drainage&#13;
problem), efficiency (the extent to which an option is cost-effective), and acceptability (the extent to which&#13;
an option is acceptable for whatever reasons).&#13;
1.12    Conclusion: There is now a widespread consensus between Pakistan and its principal donors that&#13;
the lack of an effective drainage system for the IBIS is by far the principal threat to the sustainability of&#13;
agriculture in the Indus Basin, and that it demands urgent solutions. Not only must the drainable surplus&#13;
be reduced dramatically and permanently at source, but internal drainage must be more adequate, and the&#13;
IBIS must be provided with a drainage outlet to the Arabian Sea; hence the urgency of constructing the&#13;
National Surface Drainage System (NSDS). The NSDS is intended to link the Spinal Drain of the Left&#13;
Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) to the upper reaches of the Indus Basin in Punjab through a trunk drain, and&#13;
possibly to the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) on the Right Bank of the River Indus.&#13;
1.13    Origins of the Crisis: The principal causes of waterlogging and salinity are irrigation without&#13;
drainage, over-irrigation, and low delivery efficiency of the irrigation (35 to 40 percent from canal head to&#13;
root zone) and drainage system. These are in turn rooted in the lack of an appropriate National Water&#13;
Policy. The semiarid climatic conditions prevailing in Pakistan also lead to accumulation of salts in the root&#13;
zone. In addition, irrigation supplies add more than 1.2 metric tons of salt per hectare per year to the root&#13;
zone. Groundwater pumpage, which is unregulated, further aggravates the situation by mobilizing salts&#13;
dissolved in the groundwater aquifer, if the effluent cannot be safely disposed.&#13;
1.14    Policy and Institutional Issues8: The irrigation and drainage system suffers from a number of&#13;
fundamental problems, notably: (i) unsatisfactory planning and programming of public expenditure on&#13;
drainage; (ii) implementation delays; (iii) unsatisfactory planning, funding and execution of operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M); (iv) deteriorating capabilities of key institutions; (v) lack of public participation; (vi)&#13;
inadequate investment in drainage; (vii) poor monitoring of drainage projects and infrastructure, and (viii)&#13;
inadequate investmnent in drainage research, and lack of application of research results to policy and&#13;
planning. O&amp;M of drainage is inadequately financed. Between FY90 and FY92, Provinces allocated an&#13;
average of 26 percent less than was required for O&amp;M each year. This translates to almost nil for non-&#13;
wage expenditures, although O&amp;M for off-farm and sub-surface drainage is largely mechanical.&#13;
8       A detailed description of the background of the irrigation and drainage sector, ithe major problems, their&#13;
origins, diagnosis, and the new sector strategy are outlined in Report No. 11884-PAK: Pakistan Irrigation. and&#13;
Drainage: Issues and Options; The World Bank, March 25, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Moreover, cost recovery of O&amp;M is grossly inadequate. Many users and polluters of drains do not even&#13;
pay for the use of drainage infrastructure. For example, urban centers and industries dispose of municipal&#13;
waste and toxic effluents in canals and drains without payment or regulation. Meanwhile, the capacity&#13;
(effectiveness) and efficiency of key drainage institutions has deteriorated significantly over the years.&#13;
Drainage Circles are reported to be over-staffed by as much as 50 percent in some Provinces. Capacity&#13;
utilization of drainage O&amp;M machinery varies between 30 and 50 percent. The poor state of drainage&#13;
O&amp;M is reflected in the periodic need for rehabilitation at roughly every five year intervals.&#13;
1.15   Financial Sustainability: After long delays, Abiana (water charges) were increased by 25 percent&#13;
in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), Punjab, and Sindh in 1993. Increases in Abiana ranging&#13;
between 10 percent to 25 percent were introduced in 1994, 1995 and again in 1996. Punjab is actively&#13;
disinvesting public tubewells in FGW areas under the ongoing SCARP Transition II Project (Cr. 2257-&#13;
PAK). This process will be extended to include all FGW tubewells in Sindh and NWFP under the&#13;
proposed NDP project; and in Punjab under the Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project&#13;
(Cr. 2901-PAK). This disinvestment is expected to result in a substantial reduction in the overall O&amp;M&#13;
cost. However, financial sustainability remains an elusive goal for the irrigation and drainage sector in&#13;
Pakistan. The gap between O&amp;M expenditures and recoveries alone in Punjab was 62% in 1994-95 and&#13;
increased to 74% in 1995-96; and in Sindh was 89% in 1994-95 and 88% in 1995-96.&#13;
C. COUNTRY AND SECTOR ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.16   Country Assistance Strategy(CAS)9: The core of International Development Association's&#13;
(IDA's) CAS is to help Pakistan to reduce poverty through investing in people, raising productivity, and&#13;
promoting economic growth. The three main development challenges to achieve this are: (i) expanding&#13;
access to improved basic social services including education, health, and rural water supply; and slowing&#13;
population growth; (ii) supporting fiscal adjustment to maintain macroeconomic stability, and creating&#13;
fiscal space for development lending; and (iii) nurturing a more competitive environment for private&#13;
investment. In line with this, IDA's agriculture strategy is to limit the role of public sector, shift&#13;
management responsibility to the private sector, help remove policy distortions in factor and output&#13;
markets, improve the efficiency of public expenditures, strengthen institutions and build local capacity, and&#13;
assist natural resource management and environmental protection. This is also reflected in IDA's strategy&#13;
for irrigation and drainage which aims to redefine the roles of the public and private sectors by promoting&#13;
fundamental shifts towards more decentralized and participatory irrigation management systems. The&#13;
proposed project is in line with this strategy especially since it would initiate and promote major&#13;
institutional reforms in the irrigation and drainage sector, and address the critical issue of waterlogging and&#13;
salinity (among the major environmental problems in Pakistan). A key element embedded in every aspect&#13;
of the CAS is to help Pakistan address the core issue of governance. The CAS also calls for working with&#13;
the Government to involve communities, the private sector and Pakistan Non-Government Organizations&#13;
(NGO) more fully in all Bank Group services and in the Government's programs. These are reflected in&#13;
the design of all components of the project. The project would address the issue of governance through&#13;
decentralization, promoting more operational and financial transparency, and involving communities&#13;
substantially in the design, implementation and O&amp;M of projects.&#13;
1.17   The Global and Domestic Sector Context: Recent advances in technologies which are readily&#13;
transferable to Pakistan (including telecommunications, satellite imaging, Geographical Information&#13;
Systems (GIS), canal lining, and computers) now make investments in modern communications, control,&#13;
monitoring, and management for irrigation and drainage in Pakistan not only feasible, but also highly&#13;
attractive financially. The opportunities for achieving high growth rates in Pakistan's irrigated agriculture&#13;
sector, with very substantial beneficial impacts for the economy, rural poverty, and the environment, are&#13;

Pakistan, The World Bank, November 22, 1995; and Board Paper R97-47 IDA/R97-28: Pakistan - Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy - Progress Report, The World Bank, March 20, 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
indeed unprecedented. Paradoxically, the ever expanding gap between the actual and potential technical&#13;
and economic performance in the sector are wider now than ever before, and is itself a measure of the&#13;
potential. To harness the enormous potential and opportunities for growth and inivestment requires that&#13;
Pakistan implement major reforms which will attract donor investment to the sector in the short run, and&#13;
private investment in the long run. These reforms should have the overall effect of granting farners,&#13;
domestic and foreign investors, and indeed the public investment program, adequate retums to their&#13;
investment. This enviromnent is lacking today in Pakistan; and its establishment in the irrigated sector of&#13;
Pakistan is the over-riding long-term challenge for the Borrower, its Provinces, and IDA. The reformn&#13;
agenda required to establish this environment includes: (i) encouragement of private domestic and foreign&#13;
investment; (ii) establishment of reliable and enforceable contracts for delivery of irrigation and drainage&#13;
services; (iii) establishment of marketable water property rights; and (iv) establishment of a market&#13;
economy for irrigation and drainage.&#13;
1.18    Formulation of a New Sector Strategy: The fundamental ailments of the irrigation and drainage&#13;
system outlined earlier, for the most part, defied all remedial efforts. An entire range of indicators&#13;
confirmed the failure of the past strategy in addressing the under-lying causes of the ills of the IBIS: the&#13;
portfolio under implementation was not closely tied to a coherent strategy or was marginal, and performed&#13;
badly; Completion Reports by Operations Evaluation Department (OED) decried the lack of sustainability;&#13;
the Borrower either sidestepped or only half-heatedly implemented difficult policy and institutional&#13;
refonms; and the performance and environmental indicators for the IBIS continued their deterioration.&#13;
Clearly, something had to change; a completely new approach was required. Tlerefore, in 1992, IDA&#13;
stopped all new lending to the sector pending the formulation and agreement with the Borrower on a new&#13;
strategy which represented a marked departure from previous strategies, in the sense that it addressed the&#13;
underlying causes of problems, rather than manifest symptoms. As part of the new aggressive change of&#13;
direction and strategy, the Borrower and IDA agreed to close eight projects between FY92 and FY94 and&#13;
restructured all the rest. The new strategy was formulated and agreed with the Bonrower in 1994.&#13;
1.19    The New Strategy: A new strategy for water resources development in Pakistan was formulated&#13;
and agreed between the Borrower and IDA"0. It takes a comprehensive approach to River Basin&#13;
Management (RBM); seeks to enhance the knowledge base to adopt sound technical solutions to drainage;&#13;
and seeks to reduce fiscal dependency especially for on-farm drainage. The strategy consists of the&#13;
following interlinked parts": (i) restructuring the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) to form Public&#13;
Utilities (PUs) around canal commands; (ii) actively promoting formation and development of Farmer&#13;
Organizations (FOs); (iii) strengthening federal agencies, notably the Water and Power Development&#13;
Authority's (WAPDA's) Water Wing, to better implement their federal responsibilities; and (iv)&#13;
formalizing water mnarkets and individual water property rights"2. The Borrower and IDA recognize that&#13;
the strategy would only be feasible if there is strong political commitment and the will to implement&#13;
real/genuine reform in the sector; under a properly defined division of roles between the public sector,&#13;
community groups, and the private sector, and within the public sector among the Federal, Provincial, and&#13;
local governments; and that it needs to be supported by a decentralized, efficient and participatory&#13;
institutional apparatus for planning, regulation, construction, financing, management and O&amp;M'3.&#13;
10      The new sector strategy and its rationale is detailed in Report No. 11884-PAK: Pakistan Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage: Issues and Options; The World Bank, March 25, 1994.&#13;
11      See page 44 para 6.1 of the report cited above.&#13;
12      Trading of water would also require irrigation canal systems which could allow some flexibility in&#13;
distributing water; and would evolve over the medium and long-term. These would initially be implemented in pilot&#13;
FO areas.&#13;
13      Currently, the public sector has full responsibility for drainage, including for on-farm drainage. Drainage&#13;
systems are constructed by WAPDA. The drainage systems are operated and maintained by PIDs. The public sector&#13;
also has full responsibility for irrigation up to the outlets to watercourses. Large multipurpose reservoirs and inter-&#13;
provincial irrigation canals are constructed and maintained by WAPDA. Intra-provincial irrigation canals up to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

D. THE BORROWER'S OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES&#13;
1.20    The Borrower's Priorities and Objectives: Regarding drainage, the Borrower's short-term&#13;
objectives and priorities articulated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY93/94-97/98) are to accelerate the&#13;
pace of implementation of ongoing projects, protect borderline waterlogged areas through preventive&#13;
measures, limit public sector investment in subsurface drainage to SGW areas, and strengthen the linkages&#13;
between drainage research and development. Other short-term objectives and priorities held in common&#13;
with the irrigation subsector are to increase the role of the private sector in development and maintenance&#13;
of water sector infrastructure, pilot-test the concept of autonomous organizations for O&amp;M, and intensify&#13;
post-completion monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). In the long term, the Borrower's priorities for&#13;
drainage include measures to: (i) reduce the drainable surplus through improved water management,&#13;
reducing or intercepting seepage at source, and biological drainage"4; and (ii) exploit the residual potential&#13;
of adversely affected resources, by such means as saline agriculture. These objectives reflect the&#13;
recommendations of the National Conservation Strategy (NCS) adopted by the Borrower in 1992". To&#13;
control waterlogging and salinity, the strategy advocates an integrated drainage approach, i.e., a&#13;
combination of, among other things, intensive cropping and tree planting, promotion of salt-tolerant crops&#13;
and cropping systems, provision of gypsum for salt-affected areas (gypsum is a soil amendment that&#13;
facilitates the reclamation of certain salt-affected soils), installation of tubewells, construction of surface&#13;
drains by farmers, and provision of subsurface drainage for selected areas. The NCS also highlights the&#13;
urgency of implementing a Wetlands Management Plan.&#13;
1.21    The Policy Framework and Drainage Sector Environmental Assessment (DSEA)"6: The&#13;
Borrower and IDA commissioned the DSEA in response to the perceived deterioration of the drainage and&#13;
environmental status of the IBIS. The DSEA was financed by a grant from the United Nations&#13;
Development Program's (UNDP) Umbrella Trust Fund, managed by the Bank, and was completed and&#13;
published in June 1993. It makes strategy recommendations for the medium term that have been adopted&#13;
by the Borrower as its strategy. DSEA's strategy is based on the following principles: (i) no project that&#13;
mobilizes salts from deep groundwater aquifers should be undertaken unless such salts can be safely&#13;
disposed of in the sea; (ii) additional irrigation water, if available, should not be supplied to areas where&#13;
this could exacerbate the need for drainage; (iii) the Government should not provide structural drainage&#13;
interventions that can reasonably be carried out by the private sector; (iv) the Government should confine&#13;
its subsurface drainage interventions to SGW areas where there is an environmentally acceptable solution&#13;
for the disposal of drainage effluent; (v) the Government should concentrate its surface drainage&#13;
interventions in areas where it is justified by the risk of storm water damage or the irrigation process, or&#13;
where it is linked to private sector drainage or subsurface drainage in SGW areas; and (vi) the Government&#13;
should give special attention to beneficiary participation in structural and non-structural interventions.&#13;
1.22   Implementation: The Borrower is implementing most recommendations of the DSEA by: (i)&#13;
continuing the ongoing program to phase out government tubewells in FGW areas; (ii) replacing the&#13;
existing SCARP Tubewells (STWs) in SGW areas with tile drains wherever possible, with beneficiaries&#13;
assuming responsibility for O&amp;M; (iii) installing tile drains where possible for new drainage development&#13;
in SGW areas. However, the facilities would be provided only where there are safe options for disposal of&#13;
the effluent, and only where the beneficiaries agree to be involved in the construction and O&amp;M of the&#13;
outlets to watercourses are constructed and maintained by PIDs. Watercourses and field channels are operated and&#13;
maintained by farmers.&#13;
14     Certain tree species are able to draw down the water table in their immediate surroundings; they therefore&#13;
function as 'biological' pumps.&#13;

International Development Agency (CIDA) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).&#13;

facilities; (iv) continuing support for controlling groundwater levels in SGW areas through sharing&#13;
investment and O&amp;M costs with the beneficiaries at appropriate levels because of externalities; (v)&#13;
encouraging construction of tertiary (on-farm) drains by the beneficiaries; (vi) directing investments in&#13;
main and secondary surface drains to areas where crop damage as a result of storm runoff can be reduced,&#13;
groundwater tables are rising, and sufficient irrigation supplies are available to cultivate reclaimed land,&#13;
and where disposal drains are required for saline effluent of subsurface drainage facilities; and (vii)&#13;
undertaking major drainage schemes in conjunction with preventive measures at source, i.e., improvement&#13;
of irrigation management at main and secondary levels and reduction of water losses at watercourse and&#13;
field levels.&#13;
1.23    The Borrower's NDP (1995-2020): The Borrower has formulated a 25 year NDP (1995 to&#13;
2020), with an estimated cost of Rs. 90 billion (1993 prices) for 77 projects; of which Rs. 18 billion had&#13;
been spent by 1993. By the completion date of the program, the Borrower expects to provide the necessary&#13;
drainage facilities for the entire Indus Basin.&#13;
1.24    The National Surface Drainage System (NSDS): The planners of Pakistan's IBIS and its&#13;
principal donors led by IDA always knew that ultimately, the Indus Basin Irrigation System would require&#13;
an outlet to the sea. The consultants who carried out the DSEA were required inter alia to evaluate various&#13;
disposal options to deal with this alarming problem of salinity i.e., other than constructing the outlet to the&#13;
sea; they concluded that it was neither avoidable nor postponable. Sustainability can only be achieved in&#13;
the long run by building a NSDS. Given the long lead time required for detailed planning, feasibility&#13;
studies, and inter-provincial agreement on cost sharing and transportation of saline effluent from the Upper&#13;
Bank (and possibly Right Bank) Indus to the sea via Sindh Province, work on the NSDS is probably&#13;
already overdue.&#13;
1.25   Institutional Reforms: Within the framework of this project, a package of major reforms which&#13;
implement all significant aspects of the strategy has been agreed. Most of these reforms are reflected in the&#13;
Borrower's Sector Development Policy Letters submitted to IDA, dated August 21, 1995 and October 3,&#13;
1995. The reforms consist primarily of decentralization and management transfer of the irrigation and&#13;
drainage system from PIDs to a multi-tier system of autonomous institutions with clearly defined roles and&#13;
responsibilities within the system; and with a firm commitment to phase out subsidies for O&amp;M in seven to&#13;
ten years. The hierarchy of institutions and their roles and responsibilities are sumsmarized below: (i) the&#13;
role of WAPDA's Water Wing would eventually be limited to inter-Provincial functions; (ii) PIDs would&#13;
be converted into autonomous Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities (PIDAs), with responsibility&#13;
for the intra-Provincial aspects of the system from barrages to canal headworks, and from main drains that&#13;
cross canal commands and major drainage basins to inter-Provincial drains operated and maintained by&#13;
WAPDA; (iii) self-accounting Area Water Boards (AWBs), initially set up as pilots, would be established&#13;
around selected canal commands to take over and manage the irrigation and drainage system from canal&#13;
headworks to distributaries/minors operated by FOs, and from the branch drains operated by FOs to main&#13;
drains operated by PIDAs; and (iv) FOs owned and controlled by farmers would also be encouraged&#13;
through a series of pilots in each AWB to take over and manage the irrigation and drainage system below&#13;
the distributaries/minors and subdrains feeding into branch drains operated by AWBs. Initially, the&#13;
existing FO pilots would be expanded gradually and modified to incorporate the lessons of experience or&#13;
research. The number would be expanded more rapidly on the basis of one or more successful models that&#13;
would emerge from the pilots. The legal framework for the institutional reforms has been established with&#13;
the enactment of the PIDA Acts in all Provinces. The Borrower also intends to implement other important&#13;
reforms. It intends to reorient the functions and organization of WAPDA's Water Wing towards&#13;
coordinated management and regulation of the Indus Basin; and  streamline W'APDA's organization,&#13;
internal policies and procedures to increase its overall efficiency. The Chairman of WAPDA outlined these&#13;
institutional reforms in a letter to IDA dated July 31, 1995.&#13;
1.26    Pilot Projects: Under LBOD, a pilot-oriented feasibility study for an AWB on Nara Canal&#13;
Command is being carried out, with funding from IDA's Institutional Development Fund (Grant No.&#13;
28879); and pilots of wholesale (distributary level) FOs are underway in Nawabshah, Sanghar, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Mirpurkhas Districts with the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) as the principal&#13;
consultant. Feasibility studies have recently been completed for AWBs on Chashma Right Bank Canal in&#13;
NWFP17 and Lower Bari Doab Canal in Punjab (Bank-Managed UNDP Grant). Under On-Farm Water&#13;
Management III (Ln/Cr. 2245/3327-PAK), three pilots of minor/distributary level FOs are underway (two&#13;
on minors in NWFP, and one on a distributary in Punjab). Under SCARP Transition II (Cr. 2257-PAK),&#13;
there has been overwhelmingly positive response from farmers, and ownership from Provinces, to the new&#13;
approach of using Social Organizers to help farmers establish FOs (around FGW tubewells transferred to&#13;
farmers), which was introduced after the Mid-term Review (MTR) in 1994. Since then, over 500 village-&#13;
level FOs have been established in Punjab and 70 in Sindh around FGW tubewells which are being&#13;
"transitioned" (transferred) from PIDs to fanners, and about 100 more are planned. Building on this&#13;
beginning, over 6,300 such village-level FOs are due to be established under the proposed Punjab Private&#13;
Sector Groundwater Development Project. Under the recently approved Balochistan Community Irrigation&#13;
and Agriculture Project (Cr. 2780-PAK), between 45-50 FOs will be established around community&#13;
irrigation facilities. The village-level FOs will later be consolidated at the minor/distributary levels under&#13;
future projects, to benefit from economies of scale.&#13;
E. EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR&#13;
1.27   The Indus Basin Project: The Bank has a long history of collaboration and partnership with&#13;
Pakistan in irrigation and drainage development ever since Pakistan's independence in 1947. It remains&#13;
the principal donor to the sector. In 1960, the Bank helped negotiate the Indus Water Treaty between&#13;
Pakistan and India, with Pakistan acquiring rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers. Shortly&#13;
thereafter, the Bank helped Pakistan establish the Indus Basin Development Fund, which financed the&#13;
Indus Basin Replacement Works Project (IBRWP). The IBRWP was completed to quality, under budget&#13;
and on schedule (within 10 years). IBRWP helped Pakistan build the world's largest contiguous surface&#13;
irrigation system. The IBRWP was instrumental in the creation and strengthening of the main institutions&#13;
currently dominating the water sector in Pakistan, notably WAPDA. In 1958, the Bank helped the&#13;
Borrower formulate the SCARPs program.&#13;
1.28   Planning Studies: In 1973, the Bank assisted Pakistan to formulate the Revised Action Plan,&#13;
which was the perspective plan for the sector's development in the 1970s. The physical targets of the&#13;
SCARPs and the Revised Action Plan programs have largely been achieved albeit behind schedule. In&#13;
1990, the Bank was again instrumental in the formulation of the Water Sector Investment Planning Study&#13;
(WSIPS), which served as a perspective plan for the Eighth Five Year Plan (1993-1998) that is currently&#13;
under implementation. The DSEA was the most recent sector-wide master planning study to be formulated&#13;
with the Bank's assistance. It will likely serve as the perspective plan for the Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-&#13;
2003).&#13;
1.29   External Assistance to the Sector: Since 1990, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank&#13;
(ADB), Japan, and Germany have been the major sources of external assistance in the water sector in&#13;
Pakistan. Others who have provided assistance include Canada, France, the Netherlands, Sweden,&#13;
Switzerland, United Kingdom, European Union, the International Fund for Agricultural Development&#13;
(IFAD), and UNDP. The Bank has worked closely with the other external agencies in overcoming&#13;
many of the constraints affecting project implementation and operational performance identified earlier.&#13;
Since 1993, IDA has been collaborating very closely with other donors on the restructuring and supervision&#13;
turnaround of the $880 million LBOD (Cr. 1532-PAK); and actively assisting the Borrower in&#13;
strengthening public sector expenditure programming through the introduction of a three-year rolling&#13;
Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) for federally funded projects. This has already assisted in&#13;
accelerating the implementation of water sector projects by enhancing budget allocations and protecting&#13;
these projects against across-the-board budget cuts. The 1995/96 to 1997/98 PSDP provided a budget of&#13;
Rs 12.9 billion for irrigation and drainage projects for FY1995/96. Most external agencies see continued&#13;
17     For the proposed lift canal system, financed by Japan's International Cooperation Agency (JICA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
involvement in the water sector as important in protecting and enhancing the large investments that have&#13;
already been made, ensuring that their intended benefits are realized and improving the effective utilization&#13;
of the Indus river water resources.&#13;
1.30    The Lessons of Development Assistance Experience: The lessons of experience, reflected&#13;
frequently in reports published by IDA's OED on similar Bank/IDA-financed projects in Pakistan, Mexico,&#13;
Egypt, Indonesia, lndia, and Philippines, and from ongoing implementation of the LBOD Project (Cr.&#13;
1 532-PAK) are pertinent to the proposed project. They are: (i) irrigation development should be linked to a&#13;
proper drainage strategy and investment program; (ii) a long-term solution for disposal of drainage effluent&#13;
is essential for drainage; (iii) program or policy-based lending is preferred to project-based lending for&#13;
promoting reform and reducing the backlog/overhang of the portfolio of on-going projects; (iv)&#13;
Government/donor commitment to too many discrete projects can exacerbate the problem  of over-&#13;
commitment of resources; (v) a strong O&amp;M program with reliable funding and cost recovery should be&#13;
instituted during implementation and sustained after completion; (vi) capabilities of key institutions to&#13;
implement projects in a timely fashion should be developed; (vii) farmer's involvement in design,&#13;
implementation, and O&amp;M is essential for sustainability. The most effective way to achieve their&#13;
participation is to have beneficiaries bear and finance part of the construction costs, if necessary through&#13;
credit. Beneficiaries' assumption of part of the cost of the irrigation infrastructure, beginning at the outset&#13;
of the project, increases their commitment to use the infrastructure effectively, and to recover the money&#13;
invested in it; (viii) the only effective mechanism to increase cost recovery is to turn over parts of the&#13;
system to farmers; (jx) monitoring water use in irrigation projects is essential for the good management of&#13;
this scarce resource. Flow meters, a relatively low-cost item, should be provided as part of future projects;&#13;
(x) extension services should educate farmers about the importance of the meters and irrigation scheduling&#13;
to optimize crop production. In larger surface water schemes, measuring devices should be provided as a&#13;
matter of course at all distribution structures, including even the smallest farm outlets (as small as 50&#13;
hectares); (xi) beneficiaries organized in users' associations have demonstrated their responsiveness for&#13;
O&amp;M of infrastructure transferred to them by Government; and (xii) lack of timely preparation of&#13;
feasibility studies and engineering designs has been a major constraint to the implementation of time-slice&#13;
projects. The design of the NDP project reflects the lessons of experience enumerated above.&#13;
1.31    Lessons from Research: The lessons from research on water rights in other countries are also of&#13;
interest"8: (i) there are very substantial welfare and income gains from permitting trade in water, at&#13;
whatever level; (ii) water rights should be separated from land; (iii) water rights should be allocated based&#13;
on historical usage, and surplus amounts to usage should be auctioned off; (iv) transaction costs for trading&#13;
in water are very low, and the availability of adjustable gates is helpful to facilitate such trading; (v)&#13;
environmental regulations need to be enforced; (vi) the Government has a role to play in resolving the&#13;
conflicts that could arise; and (vii) public subsidies for O&amp;M of irrigation obstruct water market&#13;
development.&#13;
2. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, FRAMEWORK, AND STRATEGY&#13;
2.1     Project Objectives: The goal of the project is to implement the first phase of the Borrower's and&#13;
Provinces' 25-year NDP which is designed to minimize saline drainable surplus, and facilitate the eventual&#13;
evacuation of all saline drainable surplus from the Indus Basin to the Arabian Sea, and thereby restore&#13;
enviromnentally-sound irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. The objectives of the project are to improve the&#13;
efficiency of the irrigation and drainage system in Pakistan, and ensure its sustaeinability, through: (i)&#13;
establishing an appropriate policy environment and institutional framework, and strengthening capacity of&#13;
18     These results are summarized from Trading Water-Use Rights: What Can We Learn From Chile, by K.&#13;
William Easter and Robert Hearne, mimeo dated November 28, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
sector institutions (i.e., carrying out the first phase of policy and institutional reforms in the water sector);&#13;
(ii) improving sector policies and planning; (iii) strengthening the technical foundations of and knowledge&#13;
base on irrigation and drainage; and (iv) improving the irrigation and drainage infrastructure network.&#13;
2.2    Project Framework: The project is the next logical step in a progressive evolution of Pakistan's&#13;
long-term effort to preserve and develop its most important physical resource -- namely the Indus River&#13;
Basin -- by strengthening the policy framework and institutional capacity for comprehensive management&#13;
of the Indus River Basin. The project does this by supporting and mainstreaming participatory approaches&#13;
to irrigation management which have been pilot-tested in Pakistan for over two decades; promoting&#13;
collaboration between key agencies of the Borrower and its Provinces inter alia through sharing of&#13;
information; strengthening real-time water management at basin and sub-basin levels; and  stimulating&#13;
national dialogue on the challenges and opportunities posed to the economy by the progressive&#13;
deterioration of its key institutions.&#13;
2.3    Institutional Appraisal and Sector Analysis:  The project has its origins in a multi-year&#13;
participatory process of analysis, identification, and preparation which was based on recommendations of&#13;
the Borrower's Water Sector Investment Planning Study (WSIPS, 1990); Eighth Five-Year Plan (1993-98);&#13;
and DSEA (1993); followed by IDA's sector strategy paper titled "Pakistan Irrigation and Drainage: Issues&#13;
and Options" (1994)'9. The DSEA, WSIPS, and IDA's sector report contain detailed functional and&#13;
strategic appraisals of Pakistan's key water sector institutions (i.e. WAPDA and PIDs), which are the&#13;
principal subjects of reform under NDP. "Steering Committees" with high-level representatives from the&#13;
Borrower, Provinces, WAPDA, and the PIDs directed and participated in the institutional appraisals&#13;
(including a series of seminars). In addition, a series of seminars and tours were organized by IDA's&#13;
Economic Development Institute (EDI) for opinion leaders in all concerned entities to countries which&#13;
have implemented (or are implementing) identical institutional reforms notably Turkey, Mexico, Chile,&#13;
United States, Argentina and Dominican Republic. Further appraisal or "assessments" of the institutions&#13;
was carried out during the preparation and appraisal of the project20. The appraisals confirmed that even&#13;
though the institutions retain substantial capacities to implement investment programs in the water sector,&#13;
they suffer from severe systemic deterioration of public sector agencies in Pakistan, especially in the&#13;
capacity and quality of services they provide. They all are in need of re-engineering to make them&#13;
adaptable to the sector's evolving requirements for basin-wide environmental management,&#13;
decentralization, and beneficiary participation. The two river basin master planning studies (WSIPS and&#13;
DSEA) demonstrated that a Sector Investment Project (SIP) or "program approach" with strong "river&#13;
basin orientation" would result in a shorter completion period and higher rates of return for investment&#13;
projects.&#13;
2.4    Reducing Saline Drainable Surplus: To reduce the drainable surplus, the project's strategy is to&#13;
improve water management through non-structural and structural interventions.   Non-structural&#13;
interventions would comprise: (i) institutional reforms to decentralize the irrigation and drainage system;&#13;
(ii) capacity building of key irrigation and drainage institutions (WAPDA , PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs); and&#13;
(iii) policies to improve the efficiency of water allocation. Structural interventions would include: (i)&#13;
modernization of canal system management; (ii) improvement of irrigation systems and watercourses (e.g.:&#13;
to reduce seepage); and (iii) ensuring proper O&amp;M of canals and drains so that they function as designed.&#13;
2.5    Evacuating Saline Drainable Surplus: To evacuate the drainable surplus, the project's strategy&#13;
is to: (i) use environmentally sustainable methods for disposal of saline drainage effluent (including&#13;
diverting saline effluent away from freshwater lakes and rivers), and lay the groundwork for construction&#13;
of a permanent trunk drainage network connected to the sea via LBOD's Spinal Drain which would be&#13;
known as the NSDS; (ii) improve the planning and programming of irrigation and drainage projects inter&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
alia to incorporate and entrench an RBM perspective in all aspects of water resources management by the&#13;
Borrower, Provinces, WAPDA, PIDAs, AWBs, and eventually FOs, and to provide the critical physical&#13;
linkages necessary to convert existing drainage systems into operating sub-basin systems; (iii) rehabilitate&#13;
and modernize drainage systems to remedy the effects of deferred O&amp;M; and (iv) provide research&#13;
resources to Pakistan's main drainage research institutes to strengthen the technical foundations for&#13;
drainage, resolve important remaining technical issues in drainage, and develop locally-adapted design&#13;
criteria. Constructing drainage facilities is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for achieving&#13;
sustainable salt balance in the IBIS. All drainage facilities fnanced under the project must also be linked&#13;
within sub-basins, and then to outfalls which must ultimately connect to the Arabian Sea either through the&#13;
LBOD Spinal Drain or via the Indus River. "RBM Orientation" will be an important theme in the technical&#13;
design of physical interventions, particularly those involving rehabilitation or expansion of surface&#13;
drainage infrastructure.&#13;
2.6    Project Design: The project has the following design features which distinguish it from previous&#13;
investment projects such as those listed above: (a) a sector-wide scope: it covers a wide range of relevant&#13;
policies, programs and projects within the country's irrigated agriculture sector; (b) a coherent sector&#13;
policy framework, notably the Borrower's WSIPS, DSEA, and Eighth Five-Year Plan, as well as IDA's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy, Water Sector Policy Paper, and sector strategy paper entitled "Pakistan&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage: Issues and Options." The expenditure program for the project has been and will&#13;
be assessed according to the criteria outlined in these policy framework documents and Country Portfolio&#13;
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) through annual reviews of the PSDP which are conducted jointly by the&#13;
Borrower, Provinces, ADB, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), and IDA. The&#13;
Borrower embraced the policy framework outlined in these reports in its Letters of Sector Development&#13;
Policy to IDA21; (c) strong stakeholder control is embedded in the design, preparation, and selection criteria&#13;
for Investment Projects and during implementation of Investment Projects; (d) participation of the three&#13;
main donors for Pakistan's irrigated agriculture sector (IDA, ADB, and C)ECF); (e) a common&#13;
implementation arrangement for the investment program shared by the three main donors; and (f) a strong&#13;
anchor in the rolling PSDP for the water sector, as well as a close linkage to the amnual CPPR process.&#13;
2.7    Linkage with Future Investments: The Borrower and IDA anticipate that if NDP is successfully&#13;
implemented, it would be followed by the proposed National Irrigation Prograrn (NIP) which is under&#13;
preparation22, and by a series of NDPs and other associated investments in the water sector. For that&#13;
reason, the project includes funds to prepare a pipeline of major drainage projects to be implemented from&#13;
the second half of this project, and for the preparation of NDP II. On the other hand, if the pace of reforms&#13;
is slow due to lack of government commitment, implementation constraints, or resistance/lack of&#13;
commitment by WAPDA, PIDAs or AWBs for real change, the Borrower and IDA have agreed and&#13;
understand that the incremental financing commitments for irrigation and drainage investments under NDP&#13;
would be scaled back or canceled altogether after the MTR or 2-3 years; and this factor would be taken&#13;
into account in determining IDA's financing for additional investments in the water sector notably NIP and&#13;
the proposed Fourth On-Farm Water Management IV Project.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
2.8    Summary Description: As stated earlier, the project is designed as a SIP. It consists of three&#13;
complementary components, with estimated total costs of $785 million equivalent, namely: (i) sector&#13;
planning and research component ($25.7 million) aimed at facilitating long-term sector and project&#13;
planning (notably for the NSDS to carry saline effluent from the drainage network to the sea) and&#13;
enhancing the technical foundations of drainage; (ii) the institutional reforms component ($57.7 million)&#13;
which is the most important component and is aimed at decentralizing PIDs, and streamlining and building&#13;
21     Dated August 21, 1995 and October 3, 1995.&#13;
22     The principal focus of the proposed NIP is to strengthen AWBs (four have been selected), modernize&#13;
irrigation infrastructure of PIDAs and AWBs, and strengthen FOs within the commands of selected AWBs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
the capacity of WAPDA, PIDAs, AWBs, On-farm Water Management Directorates of Provincial&#13;
Agricultural Department (PAD-OFWMs), and FOs; and (iii) the investment component ($683.1 million)&#13;
which is designed to improve the drainage and water management infrastructure in about 5 million hectares&#13;
and protect inland wetlands. The investments component would finance completion of ongoing projects,&#13;
rehabilitation and remodeling of completed drainage projects, and new projects which conform to or&#13;
support the overall strategies of the project. In addition, the project would finance the costs of coordination&#13;
and supervision by the Borrower, WAPDA, the Provinces, and NDP donors ($18.5 million). The project's&#13;
components are described in further detail below.&#13;
C. SECTOR PLANNING AND RESEARCH&#13;
(COST ESTIMATE: $25.7 MILLION)&#13;
2.9    Introduction: This component would consist of two sub-components: (i) sector planning and&#13;
policy studies which would provide capacity building and technical assistance for policy formulation and&#13;
sector and project planning; and (ii) research.&#13;
2.10    Sector Planning and Policy Studies (Cost Estimate: $10.4 million): This sub-component would&#13;
provide capacity building and technical assistance for: (i) policy-oriented studies on the sector to improve&#13;
sector policies; (ii) sector planning studies. The project would support various initiatives to strengthen&#13;
sector planning specifically the Annual Three-Year Rolling PSDP and the Country Portfolio Performance&#13;
Review CPPR in so far as they relate to the water sector. The Borrower already collaborates closely with&#13;
IDA, ADB, and OECF in the annual formulation of the PSDP and in the donors' CPPR; and (iii) feasibility&#13;
studies to prepare a pipeline of high priority projects for the sector to be financed under NDP or other&#13;
projects. This would include a feasibility study for the NSDS which is central to the long-term drainage&#13;
strategy and RBM program for the Indus Basin, including the legal framework for cost sharing and&#13;
operation among Provinces, the Borrower and WAPDA, the financing plan, and environmental and&#13;
resettlement aspects. Each sector planning and policy study would be commenced sufficiently early as to&#13;
ensure that it would be completed by December 31, 2003. WAPDA and Provinces would appoint&#13;
consultants to carry out the policy, sector planning and feasibility studies. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
Negotiations that WAPDA would engage sector planning and studies consultants with qualifications and&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1998.&#13;
2.11    Pipeline of Sector Planning and Policy Studies: The pipeline of sector planning and policy&#13;
studies identified or for which proposals have been prepared includes: (i) Efficacy of Past Drainage&#13;
Investments; (ii) National Salinity Survey; (iii) Preparation of the Ninth Five Year Plan; (iv) National&#13;
Water Policy; (v) Water Rights; (vi) Gypsum Pricing, Marketing and Distribution; (vii) Promoting Private&#13;
Investment in Drainage; (viii) Exploitation and Regulation of FGW; (ix) Irrigation and Drainage Atlas of&#13;
Pakistan; (x) Long-Termn Financing Options for Irrigation and Drainage; (xi) Revenue Options and&#13;
Prospects for WAPDA's Water Wing; and (xii) Revenue Options for PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs. On the first&#13;
two studies, terms of reference have been finalized, and the procurement process has been initiated. These&#13;
studies are expected to commence in the first year of project implementation.&#13;
2.12   Research Programs (Cost Estimate: $15.3 million): The research sub-component would&#13;
support two broad initiatives: (i) Major Research Programs; and (ii) Small Grants Programs. The first&#13;
research initiative would support major research programs of the Borrower, through participating research&#13;
institutes (PRIs) and WAPDA. The second initiative would complement the major research programs by&#13;
providing the following types of grants to individuals and institutions (including PRIs): (a) Research&#13;
Preparation Grants to prepare proposals for major research programs, prioritize research programs, and&#13;
prepare research work programs; and (b) Research Dissemination Grants to prepare dissemination plans,&#13;
establish external collaboration arrangements, and/or disseminate research findings including workshops&#13;
and seminars to foster linkages between research institutes and sector-related agencies, farmers, and the&#13;
private sector. The sub-component would also help strengthen linkages between Pakistan and intemational&#13;
research institutions through training, seminars, twining arrangements, and other forms of collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.13    Pipeline of Research Programs: A pipeline of potential major research programs has been&#13;
identified. Proposals for these programs have been received from research institutes. These include: (i)&#13;
Design and Management of Evaporation Ponds; (ii) Use of Brackish Drainage Water Effluent for&#13;
Agriculture and Forestry; (iii) Root Zone Salinity Management using Fractional Skimming Wells with&#13;
Pressurized Irrigation; (iv) Maintenance of Surface Drains; (v) Development of Design Criteria for Surface&#13;
Drainage System; (vi) Collaborative (Community) Pilot Tile Drainage; (vii) Institutional Framework for&#13;
Improved Sustainability and Productivity of Irrigated Agriculture in Pakistan; (viii) Impact of Pipe&#13;
Drainage Systems on Land and Water; (ix) Hydraulic and Water Quality Monitoring and Modeling of&#13;
Chenab, Jhelum and Indus Rivers; (x) Impact of Pipe Drainage Systems on Land and Water; (xi)&#13;
Networking System at Country and Global Level; and (xii) Protection of Drainage Water Quality from&#13;
Pollution by Municipal Effluent.&#13;
2.14    Implementation Plan: Procurement process for the following three major research programs&#13;
estimated to cost $3.3 million have been completed: (i) Design and Management of Evaporation Ponds; (ii)&#13;
Use of Brackish Drainage Water Effluent for Agriculture and Forestry; and (iii) Root Zone Salinity&#13;
Management using Fractional Skimming Wells with Pressurized Irrigation. Contracts for these research&#13;
programs are ready for signature, and are expected to be signed shortly after Board Approval.&#13;
Implementation would start shortly thereafter. The majority of the other identified research programs are&#13;
expected to commence in the second and third year of project implementation. Preparatory work on the&#13;
research contracts including all procurement actions would be carried out as to ensure that the research is&#13;
fully completed by December 31, 2003.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS&#13;
(COST ESTIMATE: $57.7 MILLION)&#13;
2.15    Introduction and Summary: This component would consist of two major sub-components:&#13;
(i) Institutional Reforms for WAPDA's Water Wing; and (ii) Institutional Reforms for PIDs. Both sub-&#13;
components, although not having the largest financial allocation, are by far thie most important sub-&#13;
components of the project. The objectives of the component are to improve the performance of WAPDA&#13;
and PIDs, by introducing institutional reforms. The essential elements of the institutional reforms are: (a)&#13;
redefining roles and functions; (b) decentralizing roles and responsibilities; (c) streamlining; (d)&#13;
transferring management responsibility for those functions which should be managed by other (lower tier)&#13;
entities which will succeed PIDs i.e. PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs, or by the private sector; and (e) capacity&#13;
building for WAPDA and the new public and private institutions. Training, gender and poverty focus, and&#13;
public participation are important themes in the capacity building and strategic recirientation programs for&#13;
all institutions to assist the Borrower and its Provinces to implement institutional reforms.&#13;
2.16    Critical Factors for Success: In order to increase the probability of the institutional reform&#13;
programs being successful and effective, key lessons from global experience in institutional change&#13;
management have and would be reflected in the design and implementation of the institutional reforms.&#13;
These include working with the Borrower and other stakeholders for: (a) establishing a shared sense of&#13;
urgency among the stakeholders; (b) articulating and envisioning the compelling short-, medium-, and&#13;
long-term vision for the institutions within the framework of evolving competitive environments; (c)&#13;
establishing effective guiding coalitions with key stakeholders, entities, and strategic partners inside and&#13;
outside Pakistan; (d) ensuring strong leadership by senior management and officials of the Borrower,&#13;
Provinces and WAPDA; (e) seeking, consolidating, and using extensively the programs of two-way and&#13;
multi-dimensional information, education, and communication with agency staff, the media and other&#13;
stakeholders; (f) rnaintaining full-time teams dedicated to the change effort at WAPDA and Provincial&#13;
levels; (g) using positive demonstrative effects of early successes; (h) engaging large numbers of staff in&#13;
the change effort; (i) embedding institutional change in the evolving cultures of the changed institutions; ()&#13;
intensively monitoring the change process including through staff and client surveys; (k) using outside&#13;
consulting assistance wherever necessary; and (1) maintaining and demonstrating a strategic, dynamic/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
flexible, client-centered and pragmatic orientation towards the change process itself, with emphasis on the&#13;
process variables of change (as contrasted with a blue-print approach).&#13;
Institutional Reforms for WAPDA's Water Wing (Cost Estimate: $31.4 million)&#13;
2.17    Summary: The Chairman of WAPDA outlined the institutional reforms which the Senior&#13;
Management of WAPDA have envisaged for the Water Wing in a letter to IDA dated July 31, 1995. The&#13;
sub-component will help WAPDA to implement the program outlined in this letter. It would consist of&#13;
initiatives to assist WAPDA's Water Wing to implement its institutional program consisting of: (a)&#13;
strategic and RBM reorientation to focus on inter-Provincial (i.e. federal) roles, mandates, and functions;&#13;
(b) streamlining to improve capacity utilization, operational efficiency and effectiveness; (c) capacity&#13;
building, including public participation, financial management, and information systems; and (d) training.&#13;
The sub-component would provide consulting services to help WAPDA establish effective strategic&#13;
partnerships with similarly oriented institutions in Pakistan and elsewhere, training for staff and important&#13;
categories of clients such as contractors, field observation equipment, laboratory equipment, and computer&#13;
equipment and software, to support the initiatives outlined by WAPDA's Senior Management. WAPDA&#13;
would prepare, and agree with IDA on, a detailed Action Plan with a schedule for its Institutional Program;&#13;
and subsequently implement the Action Plan.&#13;
2.18   Strategic Reorientation &amp; RBM: The strategic reorientation work program would support&#13;
reorientation of WAPDA's Water Wing to strengthen its role towards more strategically important and&#13;
federally oriented responsibilities, in particular those related to integrated development, management and&#13;
regulation of surface and ground water resources at the river basin level; monitoring of land and water&#13;
quality and environmental change; and planning, construction and O&amp;M of inter-Provincial irrigation and&#13;
drainage infrastructure. WAPDA would shift its focus away from construction of infrastructure which can&#13;
be undertaken by Provincial agencies (i.e., intra-Provincial infrastructure) or which should be the&#13;
responsibility of the farmers or the private sector (notably on-farm drainage). The aim would be to reorient&#13;
the functions and organization of WAPDA's Water Wing towards coordinated management and regulation&#13;
of the Indus Basin (i.e. "RBM Orientation"). The role of WAPDA's Water Wing would gradually be&#13;
reoriented to inter-Provincial functions; and to undertake any work contracted to it by the Borrower,&#13;
Provinces, PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs. In addition, the project would assist WAPDA's Water Wing to enter&#13;
the Information Age in the 21st century by turning it from a construction agency to a "knowledge water&#13;
resources agency"; establishing more effective mutual dependencies, partnerships and collaborative&#13;
arrangements with Provincial entities (Environmental Protection Agencies - EPAs, PIDAs, PAD-OFWMs,&#13;
AWBs and FOs), and national, international, non-governmental, and private sector entities.&#13;
2.19   Streamlining: The streamlining work program would support efforts of WAPDA's Senior&#13;
Management to streamline its organization, intemal processes, and procedures to improve institution's&#13;
operating efficiency and its capacity to manage the Indus Basin as a unified hydrological entity. This&#13;
would involve a process of identifying and removing obstacles to the utilization of existing and potential&#13;
institutional capacity, and streamlining its operations and management.&#13;
2.20    Capacity Building: Capacity building is the largest initiative in the sub-component. It would&#13;
finance initiatives aimed at creating or strengthening institutional capabilities in WAPDA's Water Wing for&#13;
RBM through specific interventions in aspects of its operations such as environmental management, M&amp;E,&#13;
public participation, financial management, information systems, procurement and contract administration,&#13;
planning, and succession planning. The component would also fund training programs which would be&#13;
formulated in consultation with OECF, ADB, and concerned agencies in Provinces. OECF has proposed&#13;
that UNDP (Pakistan) would manage, coordinate and supervise the training component financed by&#13;
OECF. Collaborative arrangements would also be established to ensure synergies between EDI's&#13;
Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Program and the priorities of WAPDA's Academies and&#13;
Colleges, notably on decentralization and irrigation management transfer. The expected retirement of a&#13;
substantial number of senior managers in WAPDA poses major challenges, but also presents unique&#13;
opportunities for renewal and reorientation of the institution. This project component would provide the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
resources and framework to help the Borrower and WAPDA address the issue during the pivotal transition&#13;
phase for WAPDA.&#13;
Institutional Program for PIDs (Cost Estimate: $26.3 million)&#13;
2.21    Summary: This sub-component would include the costs of consultants (including financial and&#13;
management consultants, social organizers, service contracts with NGOs, and external auditors), vehicles,&#13;
computer equipment and software, staff training, alternative skills development and redundancy packages,&#13;
and incremental staff and operating costs to assist in the planning and implementation of the&#13;
decentralization of PIDs and management transfer of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure process. The&#13;
sub-component would support the following initiatives: (a) establishment of PIDAs, pilot AWBs and FOs&#13;
on pilot basis in each Province; (b) transitioning irrigation systems from the PIDAs to AWBs and FOs; and&#13;
(c) streamlining and cost reduction among the decentralized PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs to enable them to&#13;
carry out their functions; and (d) capacity building of the PIDAs, AWBs, FOs and PAD-OFWMs.&#13;
2.22    The Policy Framework:  In August 1995, the Borrower decided in consultation with its&#13;
Provinces and IDA and ADB that it would implement the strategy/vision agreed with IDA and ADB by&#13;
adopting institutional arrangements that were appropriate for Pakistan's socio-economic conditions. The&#13;
strategy and institutional reforms are outlined in the Borrower's Sector Development Policy Letters to&#13;
IDA. The reforms include a firm commitment and plan to phase out subsidies for O&amp;M in seven to ten&#13;
years.&#13;
2.23    The Institutional Reforms: The Borrower and its Provinces intend to: (i) convert their PIDs into&#13;
autonomous PIDAs; (ii) transition fmancially self-accounting AWBs on a pilot basis from existing&#13;
"Circles" of PIDs in selected canal commands; and (iii) promote the formation of FOs on a pilot basis.&#13;
Pilot FOs owned and controlled by farmers would take over and manage the irrigation and drainage system&#13;
below the distributaries/minors, sub-drains feeding into branch drains operated by pilot AWBs, tubewells&#13;
and tile drains. While the Borrower, its Provinces and IDA agree on the direction of reform, the pace at&#13;
which the decentralization and management transfer process can or should be implemented is as yet&#13;
unclear. The likely trajectory of institutional reforms in each Province will depend on a number of factors&#13;
whose evolution is difficult to predict, but include: (i) first and most important, the commitment and&#13;
political will of the Borrower and its Provinces to exercise leadership in implementing the decentralization&#13;
and management transfer process; (ii) second, the implementation capacity of each Province and its&#13;
consultants to implement the decentralization process; (iii) third, the willingness and cooperation of the&#13;
affected farming population (notably the more influential feudal landlords); and (iv) fourth, the willingness&#13;
of PIDs (notably their staff) to embrace the reforms.&#13;
2.24   Legal Framework and Enabling Legislation: The Canal and Drainage Act of 1873 is the over-&#13;
riding legal framework for the irrigation and drainage sector. During project preparation, the NDP&#13;
Feasibility Study Consultants investigated the possibility of implementing the institutional reforms&#13;
envisaged under the project without enacting new legislation or amending existing legislation, and&#13;
concluded that at the minimum, amendments would be required. The PIDA Acts provide the legal&#13;
framework for establishment of PIDAs, AWBs, FOs, and regulation of the decentralized water sector. The&#13;
PIDA Ordinances were promulgated by all the Provinces in January 1997, in the absence of Provincial&#13;
Assemblies. Following the general election in February 1997, all the Provincial Assemblies have approved&#13;
the PIDA Acts, and all provinces have reenacted the PIDA Acts. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
Negotiations that the Provinces would establish at least one A WB in a canal command in each Province,&#13;
selected in consultation with IDA, within one year of the establishment of the PIDA.&#13;
2.25    Adequacy of the Enabling Legislation: Our review of the PIDA Acts has confirmed earlier&#13;
indications from dialogue with the Borrower and Provinces, that the Acts are adequate to implement the&#13;
institutional reforms envisaged under the project. However, there is still scope for improvement in the&#13;
following areas: (a) providing for more autonomy for PIDAs and AWBs; (b) clearly describing the roles&#13;
and responsibilities of AWBs, and in case of some Provinces of FOs; (c) describing the organization of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
AWBs; (d) providing for the establishment of a separate or quasi-autonomous agency to regulate and&#13;
adjudicate the decentralized irrigation and drainage institutions and infrastructure; (e) providing for fuller&#13;
and faster financial self-sustainability of PIDAs and AWBs (rather than partial self-sustainability - of&#13;
operation and maintenance costs only - over a 7-10 year time frame provided for in the Acts); and (t)&#13;
providing for faster financial self-sustainability of Farmer Organizations (rather than 7 years provided for&#13;
in the Acts). Nevertheless, the PIDA Acts are adequate in their present form. Subsequent refinements and&#13;
improvements are expected during implementation.  The above issues will be addressed during&#13;
implementation through dialogue, and as the political environment becomes more favorable. The&#13;
Borrower and the Provinces have agreed that they would annually review the PIDA Acts based on the&#13;
experience of implementation, and would agree with the NDP donors on any amendments and&#13;
improvements to the statute. This is reflected in the agreed Action Plan for the project (Annex 7).&#13;
2.26   Agreements and Safeguards: The strong commitment of the Borrower to implement the reforms&#13;
as indicated in the Sector Development Policy Letter and WAPDA's Institutional Program Letter,&#13;
promulgation of the PIDA Ordinances in all Provinces, their subsequent approval by Provincial&#13;
Assemblies, and reenactment by the Provinces have provided IDA with satisfactory basis for the financing&#13;
of the project. There however remains a risk that the Provinces may modify important provisions of the&#13;
PIDA Acts for whatever reason to the detriment of the project. Sufficient safeguards have been built into&#13;
the design of the project. The Borrower and IDA have agreed and understand that the incremental&#13;
financing commitments for irrigation and drainage investments under NDP would be scaled back or&#13;
canceled altogether after the MTR if the pace of reforms is slow due to lack of government commitment,&#13;
implementation constraints, or resistance/lack of commitment by WAPDA, PIDAs or AWBs for real&#13;
change.  This factor would be taken into account in determining annual incremental financing&#13;
commitments to participating agencies (PA) under the project, and in determining IDA's financing for&#13;
additional investments in the water sector. In addition, only PIDAs, AWBs and FOs which are established&#13;
and meet the eligibility criteria would be eligible to participate in the project23. The General Conditions&#13;
(Section 6), Development Credit Agreement (Section 5.01 e which specifies remedies of the Association in&#13;
the event of repeal or material modification of the PIDA Ordinance), and Project Agreement (Section 2.04&#13;
which specifies eligibility criteria for annual incremental fnancing commitments to PIDAs, AWBs and&#13;
FOs, and the Action Plan for the Project referred to in Section 2.01b) afford the necessary safeguards and&#13;
remedies to IDA.&#13;
2.27   Streamlining and Cost Reduction in Operations of Decentralized Irrigation Institutions: The&#13;
project would finance the costs of conducting more thorough and participatory institutional assessments;&#13;
redefining the mandates, and developing business plans; and introducing organizational adjustments,&#13;
structuring, and realigning levels' and composition of staff of PIDAs, pilot AWBs, and pilot FOs. To help&#13;
the new entities achieve significant cost reductions and improve their productivity, Provinces would&#13;
impose hiring freezes on all PIDAs and AWBs, reassign redundant staff to other organizations, and offer&#13;
them incentives for early retirement. The project would also provide assistance to PIDAs and AWBs to&#13;
"transition" (i.e. transfer) FGW tubewells, on-farm tile drains, and sub-drains to farmers through FOs. This&#13;
process is expected to generate significant cost savings. To this end, the project would finance the costs of&#13;
PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs to conduct "Diagnostic Reviews" and prepare Business or Operational Plans of&#13;
their irrigation and drainage operations.&#13;
E. INVESTMENTS&#13;
(COST ESTIMATE: $683.1 MILLION)&#13;
2.28   Introduction and Summary: This component would include construction and improvement of&#13;
drainage and irrigation facilities including: (a) rehabilitation, construction and improvement of off-farm&#13;
drainage; (b) on-farm drainage; (c) rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems; and (d)&#13;
operation and maintenance through performance-based contracts awarded to the private sector. The&#13;
23     Eligibility criteria for PAs are given in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
component would finance a time slice of irrigation and drainage investments using a SIP approach&#13;
including: (i) civil works; (ii) equipment; (iii) cost of social organization, communication, information, and&#13;
education strategies, gender initiatives, and resettlement and rehabilitation associated with the construction&#13;
of drains; and (iv) consulting services to assist executing agencies to prepare Investment Projects, prepare&#13;
detailed designs and tender documents, evaluate bids and award contracts, and supervise construction.&#13;
This component would include: (i) completion of on-going projects; (ii) rehabilitation and remodeling of&#13;
completed projects; and (iii) new projects which meet the agreed selection criteria for Investment Projects.&#13;
2.29    Selection Criteria for Investment Projects: Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that&#13;
Investment Projects financed under the project would satisfy the Selection Criteria. Annex I describes the&#13;
selection criteria for Investment Projects, and the environmental evaluation procedures which will be&#13;
observed for all Investment Projects. The selection criteria, inter alia: (i) direct project interventions for the&#13;
investment component to those which would benefit the lowest third of the income strata of the farning&#13;
community; and (ii) provide for the project's investments to be implemented by Participating Agencies&#13;
(PAs) in areas under their legally recognized and clearly demarcated operational jurisdiction or for which&#13;
they are engaged (by the PA having operational jurisdiction) to implement an Investment Project under the&#13;
terms of a "Standard Construction Partnership and Hand-over Agreement", satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Agreement was reached at Negotiations that the operating jurisdiction of the various PAs would be:&#13;
(a)    FO: (i) on-farm drainage; and (ii) on-farm irrigation upto minor/distributary level;&#13;
(b)    AWB  intra-provincial irrigation and drainage within its canal command (other than on-&#13;
farm drainage and irrigation);&#13;
(c)    PIDA: (i) intra-provincial irrigation and drainage outside canal commands; and (ii) intra-&#13;
provincial irrigation and drainage within canal commands in which AWBs have not been&#13;
egtablished (other than on-farm drainage and irrigation). This would be an interim&#13;
arrangement until AWBs have been established in all canal commands; and&#13;
(d)    WAPDA: inter-provincial irrigation and drainage.&#13;
2.30    Off-Farm Drainago (Cost Estimate: $426.6 million): The sub-component would include: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation, remodeling, improvement, and extension of existing surface drainage systems and&#13;
construction of new surface drains. This would include cross-drainage facilities (e.g., where roads, canals,&#13;
and railway lines block natural drainage); modification of existing systems and construction of new&#13;
interceptor systems for selected reaches of main canals; and facilities to keep storm water out of, and its&#13;
disposal from, drainage areas; (ii) rehabilitation of existing, and/or installation of new, SGW tubewells in&#13;
Punjab and Sindh, in areas unsuitable for tile drainage, and after ensuring that this is environmentally&#13;
acceptable and after the beneficiaries have organized themselves into FOs and have agreed to take over&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;
2.31    On-Farm  Drainage (Cost Estimate: $92.6 million): This sub-component would include: (i)&#13;
construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, sub-drains and on-farm surface drains and transfer of&#13;
these to beneficiaries; (ii) installation of new, and rehabilitation of existing, tile drains; (iii) improvement of&#13;
watercourses in SGW areas24; and (iv) transfer of existing FGW tubewells to, and where necessary, their&#13;
replacement by, the private sector, and expansion of the network of FGW tubewells through installation of&#13;
new tubewells by the private sector. Under all initiatives, beneficiary groups will be encouraged to adopt&#13;
biological drainage measures, where feasible, to reduce the drainable surplus. All on-farm investments&#13;
would only be undertaken where FOs have been established and are willing to share the investment costs&#13;
and to assume responsibility for a substantial proportion of O&amp;M costs. Thus, the scope of this sub-&#13;
24     To ensure balance among the various initiatives in this component, improvement of watercourses would be&#13;
limited to a maximum of 2000 watercourses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
component will depend critically on the ability of the concerned PIDAs/AWBs to promote the&#13;
establishment of effective FOs; and the willingness of those FOs to undertake the investments on the&#13;
proposed terms. The sub-component will be accompanied by programs of education, communication,&#13;
gender focus, and social mobilization which will be designed and executed in close collaboration with&#13;
NGOs and community organizations.&#13;
2.32    Rehabilitation and Modernization of Irrigation Systems (Cost Estimate: $91.8 million): This&#13;
sub-component would include: (a) modernizing canal system management through installation of improved&#13;
communication and control systems and training of personnel; and (b) rehabilitation, improvement and&#13;
remodeling of irrigation systems, where the management of the system is constrained by the systems'&#13;
physical condition, after actual review of the irrigation supplies and demand and water allocation and&#13;
management practices. This is a sequel to the Second Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project (ISRP II,&#13;
Cr. 1888-PAK), which was closed on December 31, 1995; and has been included at the specific request of&#13;
the Borrower's highest authorities. In conformity with the project's objective of reducing the drainable&#13;
surplus in SGW areas, the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation systems would focus on SGW areas&#13;
where FOs have been established.&#13;
2.33    O&amp;M through Performance Contracts (Cost Estimate: $72.1 million): This sub-component&#13;
would support the carrying out of O&amp;M of selected drainage facilities and maintenance of selected&#13;
irrigation facilities through multi-year (three to five years) contracts awarded to the private sector. This&#13;
initiative is intended to promote the role of the private sector in drainage and irrigation O&amp;M, and thereby:&#13;
(a) ensure that adequate O&amp;M of irrigation and drainage facilities is carried out under the framework of&#13;
fully-funded performance-based contracts, and thereby that the facilities function as designed; and (b)&#13;
reduce the cost of O&amp;M through efficiency gains from competition and private sector involvement25. The&#13;
initial experience from the O&amp;M Performance Contracts, awarded by WAPDA on a pilot basis for the&#13;
LBOD drainage facilities, was extremely positive26. The Performance Contracts which would be fimded&#13;
under the project would substantially be for O&amp;M of projects/schemes which have been recently&#13;
completed or which would be completed shortly, and of newly constructed or rehabilitated facilities under&#13;
the project2". The O&amp;M costs which would be funded under the project would therefore not substitute&#13;
existing funding of O&amp;M by the Government or beneficiaries. The O&amp;M costs which would funded under&#13;
the project would constitute only a small portion (about 7%) of the total O&amp;M costs of the irrigation and&#13;
drainage system2". Recovery of all O&amp;M costs29 would be carried out under the framework agreed for&#13;
eligibility of PAs to participate in the project. Under this framework, PIDAs and AWBs shall be&#13;
financially self-sustainable for O&amp;M costs within ten years of their establishment; and FOs shall be&#13;
financially self-sustainable within seven years of their establishment.&#13;
2.34    Pipeline of Investment Projects:  A pipeline of potential Investment Projects has been&#13;
identified30. These Investment Projects would be included subject to their conforming with the agreed&#13;
25      Currently O&amp;M is substantially carried out by the Provincial Irrigation Departments through force-account.&#13;
Substantial portion of O&amp;M spending is on establishment, salaries and administrative costs, as contrasted with works.&#13;
26      WAPDA awarded 12 quasi-performance O&amp;M contracts (estimated value: Rs. 150 million) for the LBOD&#13;
drainage facilities to private contractors in 1996/97 as test runs for larger Performance Contracts to be issued under&#13;
NDP.&#13;
27      The first batch of O&amp;M Performance Contracts which have been identified are under LBOD, Pat Feeder,&#13;
Fourth Drainage, and SCARP Mardan Projects.&#13;
28      Current spending on O&amp;M of the irrigation and drainage system is about Rs. 7000 million annually. In&#13;
contrast, the costs of O&amp;M contracts which would be funded under the project over six-and-half years is about Rs.&#13;
3,300 million i.e., about Rs. 470 million annually.&#13;
29     Irrespective of whether these are initially funded by donor Loans/Credits.&#13;
30      The identified pipeline is however not exclusive. Other Investment Projects which meet the selection criteria&#13;
would also be included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
selection criteria. The pipeline includes: (i) completion of on-going projects inc]Luding the LBOD Project&#13;
(donor-funded including IDA and ADB) and the Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD)3' Project (currently&#13;
fully Govermment-funded); (ii) new schemes including the Dera Ghazi Khan Integrated Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage Project, Kafur Dheri Surface Drainage Project, and Lasbela Drainage Project; (iii) construction,&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of surface drains in 5 drainage circles in Punjab (Lahore, Sargodha,&#13;
Faisalabad, Muzzafargarh and Bahawalpur), 2 drainage circles in Sindh (KPOD, Kotri), in NWFP&#13;
(Peshawar Valley, Kurram-Gambila, Swabi, Kohat, Mardan, and Doaba Daudzai), and in Balochistan&#13;
(Khaudar, Kachi, Loralia, and KK Baund Command); (iv) modernization of 5 canal commands (Nara,&#13;
Lower Jhelum, Pat Feeder, Upper Swat, and Chashma Right Bank); (v) O&amp;M Performance Contracts for 5&#13;
projects which are recently completed or to be completed shortly (Drainage IV, East Khairpur, Chashma&#13;
Right Bank, Mardan SCARP, and LBOD); (vi) programs for rehabilitation of SGW Tubewells in Punjab&#13;
and Sindh; (vii) programs for transitioning of FGW Tubewells in Sindh (North Rohri, South Rohri,&#13;
Khairpur and Right Bank) and NWFP; (viii) improvement of watercourses in SG W areas in all Provinces;&#13;
and (ix) programs for rehabilitation and transitioning of on-farm drainage to FOs in all Provinces.&#13;
2.35   Implementation Plan: Procurement for activities which would be carried out in the first year of&#13;
project implementation have been substantially completed. Contracts with estimated cost of US$66.1&#13;
million equivalent to be fnanced from the IDA Credit have already been signed. These include contracts&#13;
with the NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants (US$42 million) and works on the LBOD&#13;
Project ($24.1 million). In addition, bid evaluations for contracts with estimated cost of US$9.8 million&#13;
equivalent to be financed from the IDA Credit have been completed. These contracts are expected to be&#13;
signed before or shortly after Board approval. During the first two years of implementation, the focus&#13;
would be on preparation of Investment Projects which conform to the selection criteria. A major&#13;
prerequisite for this viz., the engagement of the NDP Engineering, Design and Supervision Consultants&#13;
(who would assist in preparation and implementation of Investment Projects) has been completed; and this&#13;
is expected to provide substantial momentum to the preparation of Investment Projects. The Investment&#13;
Projects which would be commenced in the first two years of project implementation would substantially&#13;
comprise completion of the on-going LBOD project (estimated cost: US$166 million), O&amp;M of recently&#13;
completed projects (notably LBOD - estimated cost US$46 million), and small surface drainage schemes&#13;
with short preparation period. Preparation, appraisal, design, and procurement actions for Investment&#13;
projects would be carried out as to ensure that the Investment Project is fully completed before the&#13;
projected completion date of the Project. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA and&#13;
Provinces would complete all detailed designs and award contracts for Investment Projects so as to ensure&#13;
that all such contracts, including the maintenance period specified in such contracts, will be completed not&#13;
later than December 31, 2003.&#13;
3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.1    Project Costs: Project costs are tentatively estimated at $785 million, comprising $712.9 million&#13;
of investment costs and $72.1 million of recurrent costs. Recurrent costs comprise mainly of costs of&#13;
O&amp;M through Performance Contracts awarded to the private sector ($67.7 million). Project costs include&#13;
$103.3 million of taxes and duties.  Base costs are estimated at about $729 million; while price&#13;
contingencies are estimated at $56 million. About $218.3 million of costs (28 percent of total costs) are&#13;
expected to be foreign exchange. The costs are only indicative, would be revised yearly during the&#13;
Borrower's annual budget cycle, and confirmed only after the MTR, by which time the scope of the project&#13;
in general, and investment component in particular, would have become more definitive. Project costs are&#13;
summarized in the Table below. More details are given in Annex 2.&#13;

ADB                              84.5           55.5          140.0         17.9&#13;

IDA                             198.0          87.0           285.0         36.3&#13;

3.3     IDA Financing: IDA would finance 42 percent of the project costs net of taxes, or 36 percent of&#13;
total costs including taxes with a Credit of SDR 198.6 million (equivalent of $285 million). IDA would&#13;
finance 40 percent ($87 million) of the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs, and 35 percent ($198&#13;
million) of local costs. IDA would finance about 32% of the Investment component ($219.1 million&#13;
equivalent); about 100% of the Sector Planning and Research component ($25.7 million equivalent); about&#13;
48% of the Institutional Reform component ($27.5 million equivalent); and about 69% of the program&#13;
coordination and supervision costs ($12.7 million equivalent). IDA would approve incremental financing&#13;
commitments during the annual NDP PSDP reviews, which would be held in Spring of each year. After&#13;
the project's MTR in Spring 2000, IDA may cancel a portion of the undisbursed commitments if it&#13;
32      Includes taxes and duties ($103.3 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
concludes that progress is insufficient to justify continuation of the level of undisbursed financing&#13;
commitments or if there is insufficient movement on the institutional reforms.&#13;
3.4    Retroactive Financing: Eligible expenditures incurred after April 30, l99633 upto a limit of 10&#13;
percent of the Credit amount i.e., SDR 19.85 million ($28.5 million equivalent) would be eligible for&#13;
retroactive financing. These would include funds for start-up activities which are essential for timely&#13;
project implementation (such as feasibility studies, and detailed designs and engineering), and civil works&#13;
on Investment Projects for which construction has begun before Effectiveness, provided that procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA were followed, and in case of Investment Projects that the projects meet the&#13;
selection criteria. This is justified since the project is financing a time-slice of eligible Investment Projects&#13;
included in the Government's program; and one of the project components includes completion of on-&#13;
going projects.&#13;
3.5    Cofinancing Arrangements: The ADB has approved a loan of $140 million equivalent (SDR&#13;
93.674 million) from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) in December 1995; while Japan's OECF has&#13;
approved a loan of about $100 million equivalent (Yen 10,832 million)34. Both these donors would&#13;
participate in the project on the basis of parallel financing. Fulfillment of Conditions of Effectiveness of the&#13;
ADB Loan and the OECF Loan are Conditions of Effectiveness. By informal understanding reached among&#13;
cofinanciers, ADB would finance most Investment Project costs and program coordination and supervision&#13;
costs in Balochistan and NWFP, the costs of remaining contracts from its components under the ongoing&#13;
LBOD Project, some components of the RBOD Project, and some technical assistance costs for&#13;
environmental management and monitoring and evaluation. OECF would finance most Investment Project&#13;
costs in Punjab Province, some components of the RBOD Project; and most training costs. IDA would&#13;
finance the rest of the donors' share of project costs. This would include all Investment Project costs in&#13;
Sindh Province, costs of remaining works under the ongoing LBOD Project, some components of the&#13;
RBOD Project, and all remaining technical assistance and program coordination and supervision costs.&#13;
IDA would retain the option to reduce the undisbursed balance from its Credit by canceling an amount&#13;
equivalent to any additional cofnancing mobilized, after taking into account the revised cost estimates and&#13;
financing requirements. IDA, ADB, and OECF would enter into an agreement for cooperation,&#13;
coordination and exchange of information, which would inter alia define the roles and responsibilities of&#13;
the cofinanciers.&#13;
3.6    Counterpart Financing from the Borrower and its Provinces: The financial contributions of&#13;
the Borrower and Provinces for the project is estimated at $227.9 million equivalent (29 percent of project&#13;
costs) including for duties and taxes. The contributions from the Borrower and Provinces are projected to&#13;
increase from $5.6 million equivalent in FY97/98 (1st year) to a peak requirement of $42.5 million&#13;
equivalent in FY01/02 (5th year). The average annual contributions from the Borrower and Provinces&#13;
would amount to approximately $32.6 million equivalent over the seven years of disbursements.&#13;
3.7    Contributions from Beneficiaries: The contribution from beneficiaries' (mainly through FOs) is&#13;
estimated at $32.1 million (4 percent of project costs). Beneficiaries, through FOs, would contribute&#13;
between 10-40 percent of direct cash costs of on-farm Investment Projects upfront, in addition to&#13;
contributions of land and labor. This would replace in most cases the current practice of back-end cost&#13;
recovery which has been shown to have high administrative costs, and is prone to defaults and frequent&#13;
politically motivated rescheduling and/or waivers of payment obligations of farme:rs to Provinces.&#13;
33     The cut-off date for retroactive financing was agreed at Negotiations, and was based on the estimate at&#13;
Negotiations that the date of signing of the Credit would be April 30, 1997.&#13;
34     Loan Agreements with ADB and OECF were signed on December 6, 1996 and March 31, 1997,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
B. LENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#13;
3.8    Terms of the IDA Credit: The IDA Credit to the Borrower would be on standard IDA terms with&#13;
a maturity of 35 years. With an implementation period of six and half years, the project would be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2004 and the Closing Date for the Credit would be December 31, 2004.&#13;
3.9    On-lending Terms and Provincial Allocations: The Borrower would retain part of the funds&#13;
from the Credit for the purposes of its activities under the project; and also would make funds available to&#13;
WAPDA and the Provinces on a first-come-first-served basis, in accordance with its standard budgetary&#13;
procedures for development expenditures. Available funds from the project would not be allocated to&#13;
WAPDA or Provinces on the basis of pre-determined shares, but on merit based on readiness of the&#13;
pipeline of Investment Projects and the demonstrated absorptive capacity of WAPDA or Provinces.&#13;
3.10   Provision of Funds by Provinces to PIDAs, AWBs and FOs: Provinces would make available&#13;
IDA funds, together with their own counterpart contributions, to eligible PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs, on a&#13;
first-come-first-served basis taking into account the demonstrated absorptive capacity of each entity, as a&#13;
grant and on the terms stipulated in a Participation Agreement between the Provinces and the entity.&#13;
Agreement was reached at Negotiations that Provinces would enter into Participation Agreements,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, with each PIDA, A WB and FO proposing to participate in the Project. Aspects which&#13;
would be covered in Participation Agreements are given in Annex 3.&#13;
3.11   Incremental Financing Commitments: IDA would make incremental fmancing commitments&#13;
annually for new programs of activities to be commenced in each Fiscal Year based on the "Consolidated&#13;
NDP Three-Year Rolling Business Plan" (the Business Plan). The Borrower would submit the draft&#13;
Business Plan for the project to IDA by March 31 of each year, and agree the Plan with IDA by April 30 of&#13;
each year. The Plan would include procurement, staffing, operations, and fmnancing plans and encompass&#13;
all components and PAs of the project. Agreement was reached at Negotiations that the Borrower would,&#13;
not later than April 30 of each Fiscal Year ofproject implementation, or such later date as IDA may agree,&#13;
beginning Fiscal Year 96-97, furnish to IDA for its approval, proposals for amounts to be allocated out of&#13;
the proceeds of the Credit for financing any new program of activities to be commenced under the project&#13;
in the next following Fiscal Year of project implementation. IDA would not approve any proposals or&#13;
awards of contracts for Investment Projectsfurnished to it unless and until:&#13;
(a)    the Borrower has, with the participation of WAPDA and the Provinces, prepared and&#13;
furnished to IDA:&#13;
(i)    a consolidated Annual Progress Report (APR) on the carrying out of the&#13;
programs of activities previously commenced under the Project;&#13;
(ii)    a Three-Year Rolling PSDP for the project for the next three following Fiscal&#13;
Years ofproject implementation;&#13;
(iii)    a Portfolio Action Plan for the project for the next following Fiscal Year of&#13;
project implementation; and&#13;
(iv)    a Three-Year Rolling Business Plan for the project, which would also include&#13;
procurement and disbursement targets, for the next three following Fiscal Years&#13;
ofproject implementation; and&#13;
(b)    IDA is satisfied with the progress made in the carrying out of:&#13;
(i)    the programs of activities previously commenced under the Project; and&#13;
(ii)   the current Portfolio Action Plan and Three-Year Rolling Business Plan for the&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.12    Procurement Assessment and Management: A formal Country Procurement Assessment (CPA)&#13;
was completed for Pakistan, and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is expected to be&#13;
published soon. Work that is nearly complete will result in country-specific Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
(SBDs) which are agreed between IDA and the Borrower. WAPDA, the key implementing agency for&#13;
NDP, has been the central partner with IDA in this review process, and (together with the Pakistan&#13;
Engineering Council, PEC) is helping IDA develop SBDs for Pakistan. Notvithstanding the recently&#13;
observed deterioration of institutional capacities of WAPDA and PIDs in procurement and contract&#13;
administration, the Borrower, Provinces, and WAPDA in particular, have extensive and generally&#13;
satisfactory records of compliance with IDA procurement procedures. Two comprehensive reviews of&#13;
WAPDA's procurement and contract administration procedures were undertaken by consultants appointed&#13;
by WAPDA following the recommendations of the MTR and 1993 Joint Review Mission for LBOD, and&#13;
as part of the Feasibility Study for NDP in 1994. The reviews identified areas of weakness (mostly having&#13;
to do with delays in decision making) and made recommendations for improvement which are incorporated&#13;
as part of the Institutional Program for WAPDA, specifically engagement of consultant procurement&#13;
specialists to overcome institutional shortcomings, and mandatory assignment of NDP Design and&#13;
Engineering Consultants as the Engineer on all civil works contracts fmanced under the project.&#13;
3.13    The Borrower's Procurement Arrangements: Taking these factors into account, the Appraisal&#13;
Mission concluded that the Borrower, WAPDA, prospective PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs would be capable of&#13;
handling procurement, supervising contract administration, and engaging and supervising consultants&#13;
envisaged under NDP with the help of procurement consultants and establishment of an NDP Procurement&#13;
Unit. WAPDA would also appoint one or more consultants with internationally recognized professional&#13;
qualifications in procurement administration, from NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants&#13;
or other consultants, as NDP Procurement Advisers to provide technical assistance and training to staff of&#13;
WAPDA, PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs on procurement.&#13;
3.14   Procurement Elements and Plan: Under the proposed project, IDA will finance civil works for&#13;
construction (including rehabilitation and improvement of drains, canals, watercourses, and tubewells, and&#13;
performance-based contracts for O&amp;M of irrigation and drainage infrastructure); equipment and vehicles;&#13;
and consultant services (including Research Contracts). WAPDA, PIDAs, AWBs and FOs will prepare&#13;
detailed Three-Year Rolling Procurement Plans as part of their Three-Year Rolling Business Plans. The&#13;
NDP Coordination Cell in WAPDA will consolidate the procurement plans of PAs, and submit the&#13;
combined Three-Year Rolling Procurement Plan for IDA's review and approval by March 31, together&#13;
with the project's Combined Business Plan. Contracts for civil works will be considered only as part of&#13;
complete Investment Projects and be awarded only after the Investment Project has been approved by IDA.&#13;
IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits would be ifollowed for procurement&#13;
of all works and goods financed from the Credit. Consultants financed from the Credit would be selected&#13;
following IDA's Guidelines for Selection and Use of Consultants. Procurement arrangements are detailed&#13;
in Annex 4, and summarized in the following paragraphs.&#13;

3.15    Works - Procurement Method:  All IDA-financed contracts for works estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of $5 million or more would be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures (estimated cost: $123.1 million). IDA-financed contracts for civil works estimated to cost less&#13;
than the equivalent of $5 million each would be awarded using: (a) National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures (estimated cost: $66.6 million); and (b) direct contracting, using project beneficiary labor&#13;
mobilized by PAD-OFWMs and FOs, with progress payments based on unit prices agreed with IDA&#13;
(estimated cost: $17.3 million). Civil works contracts may be bid on a slice-and-package basis, with the&#13;
contractors bidding for individual or combined contracts up to their pre-qualified limit.&#13;
3.16    Works - Prior Review: The following IDA-financed contracts would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review: (a) contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than $5 million equivalent; (b) the first NCB&#13;
contract by each PA; (c) O&amp;M Performance Contracts, turnkey or supply-and-erect contracts (e.g. for&#13;
dredging equipment); and (d) contracts for borderline services such as GIS, aerial and satellite mapping.&#13;
All IDA-financed contracts not subject to IDA's prior review would be subject to post review on a sample&#13;
basis.&#13;
3.17    Works - Procurement Documents: Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for Pakistan would be&#13;
used after these are finalized by the Borrower, WAPDA and IDA. Until these are fnalized, IDA's SBDs&#13;
for Procurement of Works would be used for ICB contracts; and IDA's SBDs for Procurement of Works&#13;
(Smaller Contracts) with modifications agreed with IDA would be used for NCB contracts. Pre-&#13;
qualification would be undertaken for all contracts (or groups of contracts awarded on slice-and-package&#13;
basis) estimated to cost $15 million or more. Pre-qualification would be updated annually. Pre-&#13;
35      Includes taxes and duties, and contingencies.&#13;
36      Not Bank-Group financed.&#13;
37      Direct Contracting through Community Groups.&#13;
38      Of which $11.4 million would be for institutional development (streamlining and capacity building) for&#13;
WAPDA's Water Wing and PIDAs; $10.2 million would be for policy support (sector planning and policy studies);&#13;
and $65.2 million would be for project preparation and implementation support consisting of engineering design and&#13;
supervision consultants ($51 million), social design and mobilization consultants ($9 million), and M&amp;E Consultants&#13;
($5.2 million).&#13;
39      Land Acquisition &amp; Interest During Construction (IDC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
qualification would be done using IDA's Standard Pre-qualification Document for Works. All pre-&#13;
qualification documents and proposals would be subject to IDA's prior review regardless of threshold.&#13;
3.18    Goods: All IDA-financed contracts for goods estimated to cost $300,000 equivalent or more&#13;
would be procured using ICB procedures (estimated cost: $15.9 million). The remaining IDA-financed&#13;
contracts for goods would be procured using NCB procedures (estimated cost: $2.4 million), except those&#13;
contracts costing less than the equivalent of $50,000 which will be procured following National Shopping&#13;
procedures (estimnated cost: $0.4 million) by obtaining quotations from at least three reputable suppliers.&#13;
The following IDA-financed contracts would be subject to IDA's prior review: (a) contracts for goods and&#13;
equipment estimated to cost $300,000 or more; (b) the first NCB contract by each PA; and (c) contracts for&#13;
borderline services such as GIS, aerial and satellite mapping. All IDA-financed contracts not subject to&#13;
IDA's prior review would be subject to post review on a sample basis. SBDs for Pakistan would be used&#13;
after these are finalized by the Borrower, WAPDA and IDA. Until these are finalized, IDA's SBDs for&#13;
Procurement of Goods would be used for contracts awarded using ICB procedures.&#13;
3.19   Documents To be Reviewed Under Prior Review: In case of contracts for goods and works&#13;
subject to prior review, each of the following stages and related documentation in the procurement process&#13;
would be reviewed and commented upon by IDA before they are implemented by the Borrower or PA: (a)&#13;
advertising procedures; (b) pre-qualification invitation documents, and subsequent evaluation; (c) bidding&#13;
documents and addenda; (d) bid evaluation and the proposal for contract award; (e) contract documents, to&#13;
identify any differences from the proforma contract included in the bidding documents and to verify&#13;
consistency with bid evaluation; and (f) material modifications to the contract during execution. Since the&#13;
project involves numerous procurements of similar goods, works, and services by all PAs, most&#13;
commercial documents would be common to similar items of procurement, and hence would be reviewed&#13;
once and then used repetitively. Only modifications to the standard document to suit specific procurement,&#13;
if any, would be submitted to IDA each time for prior review.&#13;
3.20   Consultancy Services: All consultants whose services are financed by IDA will be selected by&#13;
PAs in accordance with procedures outlined in IDA's "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981)". [DA's Standard Letter of&#13;
Invitation and Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services will be used for consultancy services.&#13;
The following IDA-financed contracts would be subject to IDA's prior review: (a) consultancy contracts&#13;
with firms with estimated cost of $100,000 or more, and with individuals with estimated cost of $50,000 or&#13;
more; (b) the first contract for appointment of consultants for each PA; (c) contracts with finns awarded on&#13;
single-source basis; and (d) consultancy contracts for assignments of a critical nature (e.g., because of&#13;
environmental, safety, or public health considerations, Panels of Experts, Consultants for the Enhanced&#13;
Supervision Arrangements, Sector Planning and Research, Monitoring and Evaluation including&#13;
Environmental Monitoring and Audit, Social Assessments, Resettlement, Environmental Assessments,&#13;
Information Systems, and Financial Management/Accounting and Auditing), regardless of value. Terms of&#13;
reference for all IDA-financed consultancy contracts would be subject to prior review, regardless of value.&#13;
In case of consultancy contracts which are subject to IDA's prior review, the Borrower would submit for&#13;
IDA's review relevant documents at each stage of the process by which the Borrower selects consulting&#13;
firms including: (a) preparation of terms of reference and budget; (b) choice of selection procedure; (c)&#13;
preparation of the shortlist; (d) Letter of Invitation; (e) submission of the winning proposal or the&#13;
evaluation report; and (f) negotiation of the draft contract. All IDA-financed contracts not subject to prior&#13;
review would be subject to post review on sample basis.&#13;
3.21   In addition to the above provisions, the following would be reviewed by IDA (for goods, works,&#13;
and consultancy contracts): (i) any case in which the procedures used are not transparent or award&#13;
recommendation is irregular; (ii) any case in which a complaint has been raised; (iii) any request for re-&#13;
bidding; (iv) standard procurement documents to be used under the project; (v) proposals for extension of&#13;
bid validity, or delays in contract award; (vi) all advance procurement action, advance contracting, and&#13;
procurement relating to retroactive financing for ICB and NCB contracts; (viii) all contracts which are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
proposed to be awarded to entities, companies, or agencies which are part of, owned or controlled by, the&#13;
Borrower, its Provinces, WAPDA, or any other PA; and (viii) sole-source procurement contracts.&#13;
3.22    Since the pipeline of Investment Projects is as yet not known with any degree of firmness, the&#13;
number of contracts which are likely to fall under the prior review threshold cannot be determined at this&#13;
stage, but is estimated to be about $123.1 million for works (60% of IDA-financed contracts), $15.9&#13;
million for goods (85% of IDA-financed contracts), $76.9 million for consultancy services (98% of IDA-&#13;
financed contracts), and $14.2 million for research contracts (100% of IDA-financed contracts). About&#13;
67% of all IDA-financed contracts would be covered by prior review, which is below the desirable level of&#13;
80%, but is acceptable because it has been selected to strike a balance between the work load for IDA on&#13;
prior review and an acceptable coverage for IDA-financed contracts in number and value, given the&#13;
potentially large number of PAs (several Regions and Divisions of WAPDA, 4 PIDAs, 4 PAD-OFWMs, at&#13;
least 4 AWBs, and many more FOs) and the likelihood that the project will consist of a large number of&#13;
small contracts or packages (especially for Investment Projects sponsored by FOs). Moreover, it is&#13;
justified by the following circumstances: (i) the Borrower, WAPDA, and Provinces have demonstrated&#13;
experience and capacity in procurement matters on similar Bank/IDA-financed projects; (ii) technical&#13;
assistance would be provided under the project to support their organizations and conduct prior review of&#13;
procurement decisions of PAs; (iii) each agency would execute a large number of similar repetitive&#13;
contracts; (iv) IDA and other NDP donors would conduct more intensive post reviews of procurement&#13;
decisions based on documentation prepared by the project's supervisory consultants; and (v) the&#13;
Borrower's ability, and indicated willingness to accept responsibility for the risk of misprocurement,&#13;
resulting in cancellation of Credit proceeds.&#13;
3.23    Post Review: The prior review will be complemented by post review of a random sample of&#13;
awarded contracts and procurement-related documentation below the prior review thresholds; in the&#13;
following proportions: (i) for works, 1 in 20 of an estimated 883 such contracts; (ii) for goods, 1 in 15 of&#13;
an estimated 125 such contracts; and (iii) for consultancy services, 1 in 5 of an estimated 100 such&#13;
contracts. The post review would cover the final contract and any evaluation of proposals and award&#13;
recommendations. In case misprocurement is detected during post review, IDA will immediately institute&#13;
a more intensive review of past and future contract documentation for procurement undertaken by the&#13;
concerned PA. Contracts financed under parallel financing arrangements (e.g. by OECF and ADB) would&#13;
also be subject to post review by IDA on a sample basis to ensure their compatibility with the balance of&#13;
the project, satisfactory quality, timely delivery or completion, and acceptable pricing.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.24   Summary: The Borrower's Ministry of Finance will allocate funds from the IDA Credit to the&#13;
Borrower's Ministry of Water and Power (MW&amp;P), its Planning Commission, Provinces and WAPDA as&#13;
part of their Annual Development Plan (ADP) funds. The Project would be completed on June 30, 2004&#13;
and the Closing Date of the Credit would be December 31, 2004. The estimated'disbursement period is&#13;
seven years, which is only about one year shorter than the latest subsector disbursement profile for&#13;
irrigation and drainage projects in Pakistan. The shorter disbursement period is projected on account of the&#13;
demonstrated experience of program-type (time-slice) operations disbursing faster than traditional types of&#13;
project operations in Pakistan (by 2-3 years). Disbursement arrangements including use of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures and Special Accounts are detailed in Annex 5.&#13;
3.25    Special Accounts:  To facilitate disbursements, Special Accounts in US Dollars would be&#13;
established in the National Bank of Pakistan, as follows:&#13;
(a)    MW&amp;P: the Secretary, MW&amp;P, Islamabad, with an initial deposit of up to $100,000, to&#13;
finance the costs of Federal Coordination and Supervision. The initial deposit would be&#13;
$50,000 until the aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $200,000;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(b)    WAPDA:&#13;

(ii)   the General Manager (Water-South), in Hyderabad, with an initial deposit of up&#13;
to $5 million, to finance the costs of the Investment Component in Sindh&#13;
executed by WAPDA. The initial deposit would be $2.5 million until the&#13;
aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $10 million;&#13;
(c)    Province of Sindh: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, Sindh Province, in Karachi or&#13;
Hyderabad, with an initial deposit of up to $5 million, to finance the costs of Provincial&#13;
Coordination, Institutional Reforms for PIDs, and Investment Component in Sindh&#13;
executed by the Province of Sindh. The initial deposit would be $2.5 million until the&#13;
aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $10 million;&#13;
(d)    Province of Punjab: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, Punjab Province, in Lahore, with&#13;
an initial deposit of up to $2 million, to finance the costs of Provincial Coordination,&#13;
Institutional Reforms for PIDs, and the costs of the Investment Component in Punjab&#13;

an initial deposit of up to $0.5 million, to finance the costs of Provincial Coordination&#13;
and Institutional Reforms for PIDs in Balochistan Province executed by the Province of&#13;
Balochistan. The initial deposit would be $0.25 million until the aggregate deposits into&#13;
this Special Account equal $1 million.&#13;
3.26   These deposits are based on estimates of the project's financing needs and projected&#13;
disbursements from the Special Accounts, including retroactive financing. W/As for replenishment of&#13;
Special Accounts would be submitted on a monthly basis, or when 20% of the authorized limit of the&#13;
Special Account has been utilized, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
3.27    Statements of Expenditures (SOEs): IDA would disburse against Certified SOEs for the&#13;
following types of expenditures: (i) on contracts for works of less than $5,000,000 equivalent; (ii) on&#13;
contracts for equipments and vehicles of less than $300,000 equivalent; (iii) on contracts for consultants&#13;
services of less than $100,000 in the case of firms, and less than $50,000 in the case of individuals; (iv) for&#13;
training expenditure; and (v) for incremental staff and operating costs. All other expenditures would be&#13;
supported by full documentation.&#13;
3.28   Allocation of Credit Proceeds: All amounts of IDA financing would remain unallocated between&#13;
the Provinces or WAPDA, and would be utilized according to implementation capacities of each PA or&#13;
Province. IDA would not finance any costs relating to duties and taxes. Amotnts would be reallocated&#13;
annually to the various categories (from the unallocated category) based on IDA's incremental financing&#13;
commitments for that year (see para 3.11 above). The allocation among categories (given in the table&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
below) therefore relate to IDA's financing commitments for the activities which would be commenced in&#13;
the first year of project implementation (FY97/98).&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES (PAS)&#13;
4.1    Responsibilities of PAs: The Borrower would have overall responsibility for coordinating and&#13;
monitoring project implementation. The Sector Planning sub-component would be implemented by the&#13;
Borrower, WAPDA's Water Wing and Provinces depending on the nature of the studies. The Drainage&#13;
Research sub-component would be implemented by Research Institutes, under a contract with WAPDA's&#13;
Water Wing. The Institutional Reforms for WAPDA's Water Wing would be implemented by WAPDA's&#13;
Water Wing; while that for PIDs would be implemented by Provinces through PIDAs, AWBs, PAD-&#13;
OFWMs, and FOs. Investment Projects would be carried out by the various PAs which have operational&#13;
jurisdiction over the Investment Project. FOs would carry out on-farm drainage, and on-farm irrigation&#13;
upto minor/distributary level, both with assistance from PAD-OFWMs. AWBs would carry out intra-&#13;
provincial irrigation and drainage (other than on-farm drainage and irrigation) within their respective canal&#13;
commands. PIDAs would carry out intra-provincial irrigation and drainage (ot]her than on-farm drainage&#13;
and irrigation) outside canal commands and within canal commands in which AWBs have not been&#13;
established. WAPDA's Water Wing would carry out inter-provincial irrigation and drainage. WAPDA's&#13;
Environmental Cell and Provincial EPAs would have the lead role in preparation, review, approval, and&#13;
implementation of environmental aspects of the project including Environmental Impact Assessments&#13;
(EIA), Environmental Management Plans (EMP), environmental audits, and Information, Education, and&#13;
Communication (IEC) campaigns for the activities to be carried out by WAPDA and Provinces&#13;
respectively.&#13;
B. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND APPROVAL OF PROGRAMS&#13;
4.2    Eligibility Criteria for PAs: The PAs are indicated in para 4.1 above. Additional PAs may be&#13;
added on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that each&#13;
PA would satisfy the specified eligibility criteria to be eligible for incremental annual financing&#13;
commitments from the IDA Credit for new programs of activities to be commenced under the Project, and&#13;
any new contracts to be awarded by it for on-going Investment Projects. The agreed eligibility criteria are&#13;
detailed in Annex 6. Eligibility criteria for PIDAs, AWBs and FOs inter alia include that they: (i) are&#13;
established and operated as autonomous entities; (ii) have prepared and agreed with the NDP Coordination&#13;
Cell a Three Year Rolling Business Plan including demonstrating progress towards financial self-&#13;
sustainability of O&amp;M costs for PIDAs and AWBs within ten years of establishment, and financial self-&#13;
sustainability for FOs within seven years of establishment; and (iii) have achieved satisfactory progress in&#13;
implementation of their Business Plan for the previous Fiscal Year including achieving targets for cost&#13;
reduction, O&amp;M expenditure and collecting Abiana and cost-sharing (beneficiary contribution) amounts.&#13;
Eligibility criteria for PAD-OFWMs inter alia include that they have achieved satisfactory progress in&#13;
implementation of their Business Plan for the previous Fiscal Year including collecting cost-sharing&#13;
(beneficiary contribution) amounts. Eligibility criteria for WAPDA inter alia include that it has achieved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
satisfactory progress in implementation of its institutional reform program and its Business Plan for the&#13;
previous Fiscal Year.&#13;
4.3    Approval of Programs and Investment Projects: Agreement was reached at Negotiations that&#13;
institutional reform programs, research and sector planning programs, Investment Projects, and program&#13;
coordination and supervision activities financed from the IDA Credit would be approved by IDA. As&#13;
indicated earlier, Investment projects financed under the project would satisfy the Selection Criteria for&#13;
Investment Projects.&#13;
C. PROJECT COORDINATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.4    Action Plan: Annex 7 presents the agreed action plan for the project, which provides a summary&#13;
of the main actions which the Borrower and PAs would take in order to implement the project on schedule.&#13;
4.5    Overall Program Coordination &amp; Monitoring: Overall program coordination and monitoring&#13;
would be the responsibility of the Federal Project Steering Committee (FPSC), which would be chaired by&#13;
the Secretary of the MW&amp;P of the Borrower. Members of the FPSC include the Federal Secretaries for&#13;
Finance, Planning and Development, Economic Affairs; Additional Chief Secretaries (ACS)-Development&#13;
of Provinces; and the Chairman of WAPDA. The Borrower has established the Federal Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage Cell (FIDC) in MW&amp;P, which will be the Federal Secretariat for the project with responsibility to&#13;
the Borrower and cofinanciers for policy and institutional reforms under the project and for the functioning&#13;
of the FPSC. Working level coordination would be provided through an NDP Working Group which&#13;
would include representatives of WAPDA and Provinces. A table showing the organization structure for&#13;
the project is given in Annex 8.&#13;
4.6    WAPDA and Provincial Coordination: Implementation guidance, supervision and monitoring&#13;
of WAPDA's activities would be the responsibility of the Member and Managing Director (Water). At the&#13;
Provincial level, implementation guidance, supervision, and monitoring would be provided through&#13;
Provincial Project Steering Committees (PPSCs) chaired by the ACS-Development of the Planning and&#13;
Development (P&amp;D) Department or Chairman of the P&amp;D Board, of the Province. Day-to-day project&#13;
coordination, including on preparation and submission of appropriate documentation and follow-up to&#13;
agreed actions with the Borrower, Provinces, donors, and PAs, would be through the NDP Coordination&#13;
Cell headed by an NDP Program Coordinator, which has been established and is functioning. The NDP&#13;
Coordination Cell is currently located in WAPDA. Additional provincial coordination would be provided&#13;
through four Provincial NDP Coordination Cells, each of which is headed by a Provincial NDP&#13;
Coordinator appointed by the ACS-Development/Chairman of the P&amp;D Departnent/Board, with&#13;
responsibility for day-to-day coordination and supervision of the project in the Province. The coordination&#13;
arrangements would be reviewed in the light of implementation experience and would be modified as&#13;
necessary. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that: (i) WAPDA would maintain for the duration of&#13;
the project an NDP Coordination Cell in WAPDA 's Water Wing with organization, terms of reference and&#13;
staff satisfactory to IDA; (ii) Each Province would maintain for the duration of the project, a Provincial&#13;
NDP Coordination Cell, with organization, terms of reference and staff satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) the&#13;
NDP Coordination Cells in WAPDA and Provinces would be headed by an NDP Program Coordinator&#13;
and Provincial NDP Coordinators respectively whose rank, qualifications, authority, and responsibilities&#13;
would be satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
4.7    Enhanced Supervision by the Borrower: In line with the decision taken during the 1995&#13;
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR), the project would provide resources to support enhanced&#13;
project supervision by the Borrower, WAPDA, and Provinces. WAPDA has appointed a consortium of&#13;
firms as the NDP engineering, design and supervision consultants for the project to assist in project&#13;
implementation. The Borrower, WAPDA, or Provinces would, in addition, hire the services of specialists&#13;
in various fields and Panels of Experts (POEs) on their behalf from time to time to independently supervise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
the project. Consultants, selected in consultation with IDA, appointed by the Borrower, WAPDA, or&#13;
Provinces to conduct independent supervision missions, would submit their deta[iled Supervision Reports&#13;
(or in the case of POEs, Reports of the POE) to the Borrower, WAPDA, or Province as the case may be,&#13;
with copies to IDA.&#13;
4.8    Financial Management, Accounts and Audit: The Borrower's and PAs' compliance with audit&#13;
covenants on on-going Bank-financed projects has been satisfactory, although there is still scope for&#13;
improvement particularly on the quality and timeliness of financial statements and audits. An 'Accounting&#13;
and Financial Management Handbook' developed during project preparation with assistance from a leading&#13;
national firm of Chartered Accountants would be the framework for the maintenance of accounting&#13;
records, preparation of financial statements, and financial management for the project. The Borrower,&#13;
WAPDA and Provinces would establish an NDP Financial Management and Information Systems (FMIS)&#13;
Unit with professionally qualified accountants (i.e. Chartered Accountants), management specialists, and&#13;
information systems professionals with responsibility for project accounting and financial management&#13;
including development and implementation of the necessary information systems. WAPDA would engage&#13;
a firm of Chartered Accountants/Management Consultants as FMIS Consultants to develop, implement and&#13;
maintain a uniform (standard) accounting, payment and financial information system for the project; and to&#13;
assist PAs improve their financial management, accounting, budgeting, cost control systems, and&#13;
management information systems (MIS) in all functional areas. Annual audits of expenditures and&#13;
Financial Statements42 for the project and for each PA would be performed by one or more nationally&#13;
reputed firm(s) of Chartered Accountants. The NDP Coordination Cell, in consultation with the Auditor&#13;
General of Pakistan and IDA, would appoint the independent auditor for the project. Since the services of&#13;
the audit firm would be financed from the proceeds of the Credit, IDA's procedures for appointment of&#13;
consultants will apply. Eligibility criteria for PAs includes appointment of a firm of Chartered Accountants&#13;
as Auditors and submission of unqualified audited financial statements. Each PA would, in consultation&#13;
with the Auditor General or the respective Accountants General and IDA, appoint a firm of Chartered&#13;
Accountants as Auditors. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that: (i) WAPDA would engage FMIS&#13;
consultants with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1998; (ii) adequate&#13;
records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources&#13;
and expenditures in respect of the project would be maintained; and (iii) the NDP Coordination Cell would&#13;
submit the audit reports for the consolidatedfinancial statements of the project to IDA not later than six&#13;
months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
4.9    The New Portfolio Management Strategy: The proposed project woulcl be supervised under the&#13;
overall framework of the water sector portfolio management strategy; and would eventually become the&#13;
centerpiece of IDA's portfolio management program for projects in the water sector in Pakistan. IDA's&#13;
project design and portfolio management strategy emphasizes: (i) restructuring of problem projects; (ii)&#13;
MTRs for all projects, and linking disbursements thereafter to performance against previously agreed&#13;
targets, and agreement on subsequent performance targets; (iii) improving construction management&#13;
practices; (iv) annual CPPRs; (v) joint reviews/supervision with borrowers; (vil firmer management of&#13;
Loan/Credit Closing Dates; (vii) ensuring quality at entry through accelerated project start-up, project&#13;
launch workshops, and increased beneficiary participation; (viii) curtailing the role of the public sector and&#13;
expanding that of the private sector and NGOs in Bank-supported projects; (ix) eliminating policy&#13;
distortions; (x) improving the efficiency and productivity of irrigation and drainiage public expenditures;&#13;
(xi) streamlining and capacity building for key public institutions; (xii) using independent design and&#13;
supervision consultants to improve technical quality; (xiii) the use of Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
(SBDs); (xiv) strengthening sectoral linkages; (xv) requiring actions on key policy and institutional reforms&#13;
before projects are approved rather than relying on dated covenants; (xvi) requiring the borrower to take&#13;
up-front actions such as appointment of key staff, appointment of consultants, preparation of procurement&#13;
42     Maintained by the NDP FMIS unit in WAPDA, and including the Management Letters, Special Accounts&#13;
and SOEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
plans and bidding documents, approval of planning documents, preparation of detailed designs etc. before&#13;
Negotiations/Board approval; and (xvii) thematic focus on supervision.&#13;
4.10    Supervision Plan: In accordance with the project's conceptual approach and IDA's strategy, IDA&#13;
would decentralize an increasing proportion of its responsibility for supervision of the project to its&#13;
Resident Mission in Pakistan (RMP) and a Resident World Bank Project Monitor43, beginning with&#13;
procurement review and routine supervision. The donors and the Borrower would jointly supervise the&#13;
project. IDA Supervision Missions would be held twice yearly in April and November. The April Mission&#13;
would focus on reaching agreement with the Borrower on the size and composition of the NDP PSDP, and&#13;
an Action Plan to improve the performance of the NDP project portfolio. The November Mission would&#13;
focus on field visits and implementation issues. The Borrower would appoint independent firms or&#13;
individual consultants, and POEs, in consultation with IDA, to supervise the project, including to appraise&#13;
and supervise individual Investment Projects, particularly complex or large Investment Projects (e.g.&#13;
RBOD, DG Khan, O&amp;M Performance Contracts, or Evaporation Ponds) which are proposed to be financed&#13;
under the project. The Borrower would: (i) submit the Quarterly Progress Report of the Project within one&#13;
month of the end of each Quarter; (ii) prepare a MTR Report for the project, and review it with IDA not&#13;
later than December 31, 2000. The MTR would cover the first three years of project implementation and&#13;
include review of the functioning of the PIDAs, AWBs and FOs. The NDP donors would review their&#13;
financing commitment to the project based on the results of the performance of the project as reflected in&#13;
the MTR and its recommendations, and agreement with the Borrower on follow-up actions. In view of the&#13;
nature and scope of the project, its estimated annual supervision budget from IDA's regular budget (i.e.&#13;
excluding consultants funded from Trust Funds and the Credit) would be in the order of sixty (60) staff-&#13;
weeks per annum.&#13;
4.11    Project Launch Workshops: To facilitate project start-up, WAPDA (in collaboration with its&#13;
respective Divisions, Regions, and PRIs), and each PIDA (in collaboration with its prospective PAs such as&#13;
AWBs, FOs, PAD-OFWM, and NGOs) would hold a project launch workshop shortly after Credit signing.&#13;
The workshop would familiarize staff and officials of the PAs with the objectives and strategies of the&#13;
project in general, and the project components, implementation schedules, and institutional arrangement,&#13;
the project's approach to gender and poverty alleviation issues, procurement and disbursements&#13;
procedures, M&amp;E aspects, eligibility criteria, Investment Project selection criteria, and requirements for&#13;
preparation and submission of Business Plans and financial statements and reporting.&#13;
4.12    Training Workshops: The FIDC in MW&amp;P of the Borrower, the NDP Coordination Cell,&#13;
Provincial NDP Cells and each PIDA would organize training workshops for staff and managers of&#13;
prospective PAs on the project's requirements and procedures for procurement, disbursements, preparation&#13;
of Investment Projects, annual work programming, beneficiary participation, land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement planning, social assessments, and environmental assessments.&#13;
D. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.13    Social Design and Gender Issues: PAs would conduct Social Assessments (SAs) for all&#13;
Investment Projects and for FOs established under the project. SAs would be used to provide frameworks&#13;
for incorporating participation, gender, poverty focus, and social analysis into the design and delivery of&#13;
project interventions to beneficiaries particularly poor and women beneficiaries, and project-affected&#13;
persons (PAPs).  SAs would include: (a) identification of key stakeholders; (b) establishment of&#13;
frameworks for participation of stakeholders in project interventions; (c) ensuring that the project's design&#13;
and implementation strategies pay particular attention to gender and poverty alleviation considerations; (d)&#13;
ensuring that project objectives and incentives for change are acceptable to the range of people intended to&#13;
43     This assumes that Consultant Trust Funds would continue to be available to finance the costs of such&#13;
intensive supervisory services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
be benefited; (e) assessment of social impacts of interventions; (f) identification of methods of mitigation&#13;
of adverse impacts; (g) assessment of social risks; (h) identification of institutional arrangements for&#13;
participation and delivery of the intervention; and (i) formulation of plans to build institutional capacity.&#13;
4.14   Information, Education and Communication (IEC):  The NDP "oordination Cell would&#13;
prepare and update annually, in coordination with the Borrower and the Provinces, and implement, an IEC&#13;
Strategy for the project. A high standard in favor of information disclosure would be applied for all project&#13;
activities, including procurement, disbursements, EIAs, resettlement plans, Investment Project reports, and&#13;
main covenants. All PAs, working with NGOs and other community groups, would subscribe to the&#13;
project's policy and standards in favor of a high degree of public participation and disclosure of project&#13;
information to the public and the stakeholders in particular. This Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Credit&#13;
and Project Agreements, ELAs, and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) would be available to the public&#13;
through IDA's Public Information Center (PIC) and through WAPDA's NDP Coordination Cell shortly&#13;
after Board Approval. However, PAs would be entitled to levy reasonable cost recovery charges on the&#13;
recipients of the information.&#13;
4.15    Land Acquisition and Resettlement: Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA&#13;
and Provinces would ensure that all land acquisition and involuntary displacement, and the subsequent&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation associated with interventions of the project, are implemented in accordance&#13;
with the Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement (FLAR) which has already been agreed among&#13;
the Borrower, Provinces and IDA. The FLAR, inter alia, provides that: (i) involuntary resettlement would&#13;
be avoided or minimized wherever feasible through viable alternative designs; (ii) land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities, including compensation and/or rehabilitation, would be completed before&#13;
commencement of associated civil works; and would be a condition for award of civil works contracts&#13;
requiring land acquisition and resettlement; (iii) all Project Affected Persons (PAPs) would be compensated&#13;
and rehabilitated to improve or at least maintain their living standards and income earning capacity, and to&#13;
share in the project's benefits; (iv) entitlement packages would include compensation to improve standard&#13;
of living of PAPs and training, work opportunities for landless and poorer groups of PAPs; (v) an&#13;
Independent Monitor for Land Acquisition and Resettlement would supervise the implementation of the&#13;
FLAR. Submission of a land acquisition plan and RAP, and the allocation of a budget would be required&#13;
for all Investment Projects which involve land acquisition and resettlement and for works related to all&#13;
Investment Projects in the pipeline, including the RBOD. The Feasibility Report Consultants estimated&#13;
that about 3 acres of land would be acquired for each kilometer of off-farm surface drains rehabilitated or&#13;
built. The FLAR has estimated that about 9,500 acres of land would be required for the Investment Projects&#13;
to be implemented under the project. Current information indicates that except for a portion of the Right&#13;
Bank Outfall Drain (MNVD-Indus Link), there would be no displacement due to construction works. In&#13;
addition, all farmers whose lands may be acquired for the projects would benefit many times over through&#13;
the reclamation of their lands. By contrast to their land acquisition requirements, the Investment Projects&#13;
(ongoing and planned new) would reclaim an estimated 22,430 acres of currently abandoned land,&#13;
rehabilitate another estimated 162,850 acres of land, and provide drainage relief' over 5 million hectares.&#13;
The fielding of Social Organizers and the involvement of NGOs would also assist in providing fair and&#13;
timely compensation for the affected families and resettlement sites that are at least comparable with the&#13;
original sites.&#13;
4.16   Environmental Assessment: The Borrower formally submitted, and IDA has accepted, the&#13;
DSEA as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project in January 1996. Based on the&#13;
DSEA, the project has been assigned Environmental Category B. All Investment Projects would conform&#13;
to strict environmental criteria, especially those dealing with effluent disposal; and no Investment Project&#13;
would be included unless there is a disposal strategy for the drainage effluent. Assurances were obtained&#13;
at Negotiations that WAPDA and Provinces would ensure that: (i) an Initial Environmental Scoping (IES)&#13;
is carried out for all Investment Projects; and (ii) full EIAs are prepared, to the satisfaction of IDA, for all&#13;
Investment Projects whose IES indicate that they would have significant environmental impacts. Such&#13;
projects would only be approved for funding under the project if their EIA indicate that the adverse&#13;
environmental impacts would be substantially mitigated or avoided. Environmnental Action Plans (EAPs)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
pursuant to the EIA would be agreed with IDA before such Investment Projects are approved for funding&#13;
under the project. The RBOD Project and some of the other expected Investment Project proposals would&#13;
require an EIA. WAPDA's Environmental Cell and Provincial EPAs would have the lead role in&#13;
preparation, review, approval, and implementation of environmental aspects of the project including EIAs,&#13;
EMPs, environmental audits, and IEC campaigns for the activities to be carried out by WAPDA and&#13;
Provinces respectively.&#13;
4.17   Environmental Management Plan (EMP): The project's EMP includes the following activities:&#13;
(a) environmental coordination; (b) establishment of an enviromnental baseline based on a sound spatial&#13;
framework identifying agro-ecological zones; (c) environmental assessments; (d) identification of&#13;
ameliorative measures; (e) design and implementation of those measures and of an Environmental&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (EMES); (f) design and implementation of the project's Environmental&#13;
Awareness Program; (g) design and implementation of the project's Wetlands Management Plan (WMP);&#13;
and (h) expansion, upgrading and operation of the Environmental Data Management System (EDMIS).&#13;
Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA and Provinces would implement the EMPfor the&#13;
project as a whole dealing with the cumulative basin-wide environmental aspects and implications; and&#13;
environmental mitigation or enhancement measures indicated in the EIAs for individual Investment&#13;
Projects, to the satisfaction of IDA.&#13;
4.18    Environmental Monitoring and Audit: Independent enviromnental audits will be carried out&#13;
during project implementation to review and evaluate its environmental performance. All environmental&#13;
reports related to the project will be made available to interested organizations and persons in Pakistan and&#13;
abroad on the basis of full cost recovery. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA and&#13;
Provinces would: (i) appoint, by December 31, 1997, WAPDA's Environmental Cell and the Provincial&#13;
EPA respectively, or an internationally recognized environmental specialist acceptable to IDA, as the&#13;
Environmental Auditor for their activities under the project during the period of implementation; (iH) cause&#13;
the Environmental Auditors to issue their independent "Annual Environmental Audit Report" no later than&#13;
six months after the close of each fiscal year beginning from FY97/984; (iii) publish a summary of&#13;
important audit findings and recommendations in the project's progress reports; and (iv) implement the&#13;
recommendations of the Environmental Audit Reports.&#13;
4.19   Wetlands Management Plan (WMP): The WMP will focus on critical wetland areas affected by&#13;
the IBIS. It will include mitigating measures (where applicable), specifications and recommendations on&#13;
irrigation and drainage planning, and measures to improve wetlands protection. To avoid the risk that&#13;
some wetlands may be reclaimed through drainage (especially in the riverine areas), assurances were&#13;
obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA and Provinces would: (a) take measures to ensure that in&#13;
constructing field drains, wetlands are adequately protected"; and (b) provide maps and information on&#13;
reclaimed areas, including the land use pattern for reclaimed lands and the date of reclamation. Any&#13;
proposal to drain Sindh Riverine areas, areas between the main drains and the coast, flood plains, or lake&#13;
shores, would be subject to ElAs, in accordance with Pakistan's environmental protection laws and Bank&#13;
policy, prior to seeking IDA's approval for the Investment Project.&#13;
4.20    Environment &amp;  Social Design Consultants: Pre-implementation experience to date has&#13;
demonstrated the critical need for up-front preparation of proper EIAs, EMPs, beneficiary participation,&#13;
land acquisition and compensation, RAPs, information, education and communication strategies, and SAs&#13;
(including involvement of NGOs and incorporating gender in design and implementation). Consultants&#13;
would be engaged to assist a diverse set of clients including WAPDA's Regional Offices, Environment&#13;
and Social Cells, Provincial NDP Cells, EPAs, PIDAs, AWBs, FOs and Community Organizations; and to&#13;
build the institutional capacities of the PAs on these issues (including through establishment or&#13;
44     Year ending June 30, 1998.&#13;
45     For examnple, by restricting field drains to existing cultivated areas which do not pose serious threats to&#13;
wetlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
strengthening of the relevant Cell in the PA, training and deputation of staff). The Consultants would&#13;
actively collaborate with Provincial agencies (e.g. Provincial EPAs, Divisional &amp;. District Administration),&#13;
NGOs, community groups, the media, and other outside agencies. The Consultants' contracts would make&#13;
provisions for the primary consultants to sub-contract specific aspects of their terms of reference to NGOs,&#13;
Community Organizations, and other collaborating entities.  The consultants' teams would include&#13;
specialists in environment, gender, NGOs, resettlement, IEC, and social development. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at Negotiations that WAPDA would engage environment and social design consultants with&#13;
qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1998.&#13;
5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS AND POVERTY IMPACTS&#13;
5.1    Summary: The project's most significant direct benefit would be to tenant farmers, smallholders,&#13;
and tail-enders in the form of increased efficiency of service delivery, improved availability of irrigation&#13;
and drainage supplies, and reduced cost. The project's principal short term benefits will come from the&#13;
physical drainage and irrigation improvements and better O&amp;M resulting in more effective drainage, which&#13;
in turn will result in an improved environment and increased output of agricultural produce. This will have&#13;
a direct and positive impact on poorly drained land that falls within the command of each Investment&#13;
Project, regardless of the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers cultivating these lands. Estimates&#13;
indicate that farmers benefiting from the drainage improvements can expect to increase their income by up&#13;
to 30 percent, depending on the original condition of waterlogging and salinity and on the agro-ecological&#13;
conditions. The project's principal medium- and long-term benefits (particularly from the institutional&#13;
reforms in Provinces) will come from  improved drainage and irrigation-related policies, improved&#13;
efficiency of public expenditures on drainage O&amp;M, improved capability in the public sector to plan and&#13;
implement water sector projects and in the private sector to undertake drainage-related investments,&#13;
improved and more equitable availability of irrigation supplies and drainage facilities, improved efficiency,&#13;
and (potentially) lower cost of delivery of irrigation and drainage services as a iresult of decentralization&#13;
and participation by beneficiaries. These benefits will potentially be far greater than those from the&#13;
physical investments. All of these will benefit the smallholder farmers and tenants in particular, and&#13;
environment and the agriculture sector as a whole; and enhance sustainability of the land and water&#13;
resource base. A detailed analysis of project benefits and costs is given in Annex 9).&#13;
5.2    Production Benefits: The project would have two important impacts. Drainage installation&#13;
would lower the groundwater table and reduce soil salinity, thereby leading to significant improvements in&#13;
yields. The project also addresses a long-term issue: without the project, future yie-lds would progressively&#13;
decline from their current levels. Therefore, the project would have two additional benefits: (a) avoidance&#13;
of further yield (production) losses, which would result if the groundwater and salinity problems were to&#13;
persist; and (b) productivity increases resulting from reduced waterlogging/salinity problems.  The&#13;
"without" project scenario is one of a continuing trend of substantial losses in agricultural production, and&#13;
ultimately further environmental deterioration and increased rural poverty for farmers. The increasing&#13;
levels of salinity and waterlogging would reduce yields to almost zero. Large areas of crop land would&#13;
completely go out of production in the "without" project scenario. Productivity increase is, by far, the&#13;
most important of the two benefit subsets. Insofar as improved drainage may have positive effects on&#13;
agricultural technologies or cultural practices which are not included in the above estimate, the benefits are&#13;
understated. Based on the identified and projected pipeline of Investment Projects, the project is expected&#13;
to benefit many farmers directly, and the entire irrigated agriculture sector indirectly, by reclaiming&#13;
abandoned land, rehabilitating existing lands, and potentially improving drainag;e in about 13.5 million&#13;
acres. Productivity is estimated to improve over a period of about five years by about 2 percent for the&#13;
entire IBIS command areas, and by about 20 percent for tail-end farmers. Tail-end farmers would also&#13;
realize additional benefits from a reduction in costs of production and improved availability of water&#13;
through the activities of FOs. Specific interventions of the project such as lining watercourses and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
rehabilitation of canals would also increase the amount of fresh water that reaches the tail-end of&#13;
watercourses in SGW areas.&#13;
5.3    Positive Poverty Impacts: Areas which are affected by high levels of waterlogging and salinity&#13;
tend to have the lowest incomes, high unemployment, and lawlessness in Pakistan. Hence waterlogging&#13;
and salinity problems have a poverty and equity dimension too. They affect the rural poor (especially&#13;
those at tail-ends of watercourses and minors) and landless tenants most severely. By helping to raise&#13;
agricultural output, farm incomes, providing additional employment opportunities in those areas, the&#13;
project will help alleviate rural poverty and improve the socio-economic prerequisites for law and order.&#13;
The selection criteria for Investment Projects are designed to skew the benefits in favor of tenant farmers,&#13;
smallholders, and tail-enders. Specifically, Investment Projects would, to the extent possible, be designed&#13;
to benefit small farmers, women, and poorest one-third of the income strata of the members of the farming&#13;
community. This would be demonstrated through a Social Assessment for the Investment Project. The&#13;
institutional reforms, particularly the formation of FOs, are expected to increase the transparency and&#13;
equity of water allocation and use.&#13;
5.4    Other Positive Impacts: The project's interventions would reduce the O&amp;M expenditures for&#13;
social infrastructure such as roads, power distribution, public housing, etc. The project would also provide&#13;
appropriate spill-over effects on non-farm growth through backward and forward linkages, including&#13;
increasing employment opportunities in the non-farm sector Estimates from research findings indicate that&#13;
every one percent increase in per capita farm growth would provide a 1.5 percent increase in per capita&#13;
non-farm growth.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.5    Relation to the Economy (Macroeconomic Impact): An assessment of the macroeconomic&#13;
sustainability of the proposed project indicates that the planned public investment (with the project) in the&#13;
sector as a share of projected GDP remains very close to historical trends. The share of the drainage sector&#13;
investment, including the project, in the PSDP would also remain close to historical levels, partly because&#13;
many of the Investment Projects to be funded under the project are ongoing Investment Projects that are&#13;
already in the PSDP, and the beneficiaries also share in investment costs. An illustrative analysis is&#13;
presented in Annex 9, Table IA. This analysis was done by comparing key macroeconomic indicators on a&#13;
set of macroeconomic projections with and without the project, using data on GDP, PSDP, investment&#13;
costs, and the financing plan for the project.  This analysis assumed a somewhat slow pace of&#13;
macroeconomic and structural reforms, but no backtracking, (as assumed in the CAS for Pakistan) as the&#13;
macroeconomic framework (Base Case) for the project; and therefore used projections of the GDP growth,&#13;
inflation rate, exchange rate of the rupee to major currencies, and level of budgetary PSDP indicated in the&#13;
"muddle through" scenario in the CAS. The project's requirement of counterpart funds is within the&#13;
capacity of the Borrower and its Provinces for financing and implementation. Its ADP counterpart&#13;
requirements will be highest (at Rs. 2171 million or about US$42.5 million) in the fifth year of&#13;
implementation (FYOI/02)4.&#13;
5.6    Fiscal Savings: The project's most significant direct benefit to the Provinces is expected to be in&#13;
the form of fiscal savings, if Provinces implement the project's institutional reform program as envisaged.&#13;
The savings would come from transfer of responsibility for O&amp;M from Provinces to farmers. Annual&#13;
savings to Provinces is estimated at Rs. 2,519 million ($62 million) per year, representing about 16% of&#13;
O&amp;M budget, by the year of completion. These savings are based on the following conservative estimates&#13;
and assumptions: (i) transition of 1,500 FGW tubewells from the public sector to farmers' groups and FOs&#13;
46     The ADP counterpart funding requirement for each year are: FY97198: Rs. 245 million (US$5.6 million);&#13;
FY98/99: Rs. 924 million (US$20.4 million); FY99100: Rs. 1637 million (US$34.7 million); FYOO/OI: Rs. 2121&#13;
million (US$43.1 million); FY01/02: Rs. 2171 million (US$42.5 million); FY02103: Rs. 2120 million (US$39.8&#13;
million); and FY03/04: Rs. 1719 million (US$31.2 million); and FY04/05: Rs. 606 million (US$10.7 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
would save the Provincial Governments operating expenses of Rs. 616 million per year; (ii) transfer of&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of on-farmn surface drains of less than 15 cusecs to FOs would save the Provincial&#13;
Governments Rs. 14 million per year in operating expenses and salaries of beldars (daily rated temporary&#13;
workers); (iii) replacing public sector SGW tubewells with private sector (farner-managed) tile drains&#13;
would save the Provinces Rs. 124 million per year; and (iv) transfer of responsibility from Provinces to&#13;
FOs for O&amp;M of irrigation and drainage operations at the minor/distributary level could potentially save&#13;
Provinces Rs. 1765 million per year47. The detailed analysis of the project's impact on the recurrent budget&#13;
is given in Annex 9, Table lB. The above estimates are in addition to projected savings of Rs. 883 million&#13;
in annual subsidies by the Province of Punjab under the parallel Punjab Privfate Sector Groundwater&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 2901 - PAK), in which 4,233 SCARP tubewells would be transitioned. In&#13;
addition, other savings (not quantified) would include reduced maintenance costs for housing, roads and&#13;
other social infrastructure, and public health. Efficiency gains from the improved efficiency, autonomy&#13;
and hard budget constraint of PIDAs and AWBs (which are both expected to achieve full financial self-&#13;
sustainability of O&amp;M costs in 10 years) would provide additional fiscal savings.&#13;
5.7     Tax Revenues: The available evidence from recently completed drainage interventions under&#13;
LBOD (notably Nawabshah component) have demonstrated that the tax revenue and overall level of&#13;
economic activities generated by drainage investments can be very substantial. The tax revenue potential&#13;
from the project is based on the cropped area which is expected to benefit from the project, and assumes no&#13;
change in the existing composite tax structure for major crops. The area affected by the project would&#13;
depend on the intervention assumed. The Feasibility Study has estimated that the area which is likely to&#13;
benefit from the project's interventions could be as high as 13.5 million acres. If this estimate is realized,&#13;
the potential (not projected) yield from tax revenues to Provinces would vary from a low of Rs. 1,200&#13;
million to as much as Rs. 3,000 million" per annum.&#13;
5.8     Financial Returns to the Borrower and its Provinces: Based on the above analysis of Fiscal&#13;
Savings and Tax Revenues, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to the Borrower and Provinces (considering&#13;
the Borrower's and Provinces' investments in the project, and the financial returns in the form of fiscal&#13;
savings and tax revenues) is estimated at about 11.4% (nominal terms). This reflects, in large part, the&#13;
impact of subsidies for capital works. The payback to the Borrower and its Provinces from the project is&#13;
about 5.5 years after project completion.&#13;
5.9     Balance of Payments: The project's direct benefit to the Borrower and the economy at large is&#13;
likely to be felt in its impact on the country's balance of payments (BOP) position in terms of foreign&#13;
exchange saved or earned. To the extent that the projected incremental net earnings from Investment&#13;
Projects49 strengthen the country's BOP position, they would contribute to the Borrower's capacity to&#13;
service the debt associated with the project.&#13;
47      This estimate is based on the following conservative assumptions: (a) the jurisdictions which will be&#13;
transferred to FOs from Provinces are roughly coincident with the Subdivisional Officer (SDO) or Junior EXEN level&#13;
of operations under the existing system; and (b) approximately one FO will be established in each of the 43 canal&#13;
commands per annum for five years; for a total of about 200 FOs by year 5 of project implementation.&#13;
48      This illustrative analysis has been done based on applicable tax rates from the LBOD Command, on which&#13;
data is most readily available from a recent study (Government of Sindh: Operations and Maintenance and Cost&#13;
Recovery with Special Reference to Farmer Participation in Drainage Activities of LBOD, ]February 1995 prepared by&#13;
Sindh Development Studies Center - Table 6.5). Not counting Abiana, the most recent combined rates for Land&#13;
Revenue, Ushr Rates (Productivity Tax), and Local Fund (County Tax) per acre in the LBOD Command are Rs. 132&#13;
for wheat, Rs. 140 for cotton, Rs. 87 for rice, Rs. 227 for sugarcane, Rs. 137 for oilseeds, and Rs. 90 for vegetables.&#13;
Agricultural Income Tax was also recently introduced.&#13;
49      The analysis of incremental net economic earnings on six Investment Project districts in Sindh Province, for&#13;
which illustrative farm budget analysis was done, may be used to demonstrate the BOP impact. The analysis indicates&#13;
that incremental net earnings would turn positive from year 2001 at about Rs. 2.6 billion ($65 million), and increase&#13;
gradually thereafter (assuming no switching in cropping patterns and no market limits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
5.10    Investment Project Analysis: The selection criteria requires that Investment Projects should have&#13;
a minimum economic rate of return (ERR), excluding non-quantifiable benefits, of 15 percent. The various&#13;
types of Investment Projects which would be supported under the project have had historically (in&#13;
Pakistan) high ERRs (20%-50%)5°. Studies of completed projects in Pakistan also show that higher ERRs&#13;
are achieved under program rather than project approach for the same type of investments. Drainage&#13;
projects in other countries also show high rates of return5'. The economic analysis for the potential&#13;
Investment Projects in the pipeline indicate that substantial number of these projects, covering various&#13;
types of interventions, would meet the ERR selection criteria. These are detailed in Annex 9. The ERRs&#13;
of the various types of Investment Projects also span a wide range. These reflect variations in cropping&#13;
patterns and yield levels, the degree of surface flooding and its frequency, the extent of waterlogging, and&#13;
the available irrigation supplies.&#13;
5.11    Farm  Incomes: Illustrative farm budget analysis, conducted for sample farms and for various&#13;
types of Investment Projects, shows that the project would increase farm incomes by 6% to 128%&#13;
depending on the agro-climatic zone and the current situation; and that beneficiaries would be able to pay&#13;
their share of capital and O&amp;M costs associated with the project's investments and institutional reforms,&#13;
while still continuing to realize substantial increases in their net incomes.&#13;
5.12    Cost Sharing: Arrangements for cost sharing are an integral part of the project's design. They&#13;
aim to increase the contribution of farmers for capital costs, and to progressively ensure that all O&amp;M costs&#13;
are recovered52. The project's design for farmners' contributions to capital costs is based on the principle of&#13;
substantial up-front cost sharing, which has been demonstrated through experience to be superior to back-&#13;
end cost recovery. Past history has shown that back-end cost recovery for capital costs tends not to work&#13;
in reality, and moreover unduly involves non-financial institutions (notably PAD-OFWMs) into credit&#13;
activities for which they are not equipped or organized; and that that farmers' contributions are higher, and&#13;
administrative costs lower, under up-front cost sharing. Unlike in previous projects where the Borrower or&#13;
Provinces constructed and maintained irrigation and drainage projects without prior approval of farrners,&#13;
the farners will largely be the sponsors of on-farm drainage and irrigation projects under NDP. They will&#13;
also be responsible for post-construction O&amp;M costs of this infrastructure. The Borrower and all Provinces&#13;
have recently introduced an agricultural wealth tax and agricultural income taxes to tax agricultural&#13;
incomes. The Borrower has also agreed that it would formulate proposals to ensure that recovery of capital&#13;
costs is linked to benefits derived from the project especially for large landholders e.g.: by updating&#13;
Produce Index Units (PIUs) in the Investment Project areas based on baseline and post-completion&#13;
cadastral surveys. The cost sharing arrangements for various types of Investment Projects would be&#13;
stipulated in the Participation Agreements between Provinces and PIDAs, AWBs and FOs; and would be as&#13;
detailed in the table below:&#13;
50      For example, the completion ERRs for similarly designed sector Investment Projects (i.e. designed on a&#13;
program approach) in Pakistan were 23 percent for Command Water Management (Cr. 1487-PAK), 32 percent for&#13;
SCARP Transition Pilot (Cr. 1693-PAK), 22 percent for On-farm Water Management II (Cr. 1603-PAK), over 50&#13;
percent for Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project I (Ln. 2210-PAK), and 45 percent for On-farm Water Management&#13;
I (Cr. 1163-PAK). Completion ERRs for Specific Investment Projects were lower e.g., 7.6 percent for Khairpur Tile&#13;
Drainage and Irrigated Farming Development (Cr. 0648-PAK), 13 percent for SCARP Mardan (Ln. 1733-PAK), 14.5&#13;
percent for Fourth Drainage (Cr. 1375-PAK), and 23 percent for SCARP VI.&#13;
51      A study in Kailanakhas (India) showed that even farms neighboring the project area benefited significantly&#13;
as a consequence of their land improvement. The yield of wheat increased from 600 to 1600 kg per hectare in a period&#13;
of four years. Similar results were observed for mustard, bajra, and other crops.&#13;
52      PIDAs and AWBs would become financially self-sustainable for O&amp;M costs in 10 years; and FOs would&#13;
become financially self-sustainable in 7 years.&#13;

C. RISKS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
5.13    Project Risks: The project is a 'high reward-high risk' venture. The project in general and the&#13;
institutional reforms in particular if implemented, would provide enormous benefits as outlined earlier.&#13;
These reforms represent the only solution to ensure the long-term sustainability of the irrigation and&#13;
drainage system and the agriculture sector of Pakistan. However, the project also has very significant risks.&#13;
These risks, as well as the risk-mitigation and risk-management factors/strategies53, are discussed below&#13;
under the following headings: (i) derailment of the institutional reform program; (ii) slow or imperfect&#13;
formation of FOs; and (iii) sustainability of investments in irrigation and drainage infrastructure.&#13;
5.14    Derailment of the Institutional Reform Program: As is inherent in any major reform program,&#13;
the institutional reforms supported by the project carry very significant risks. The proposed institutional&#13;
reforms would significantly affect the existing power relationships and alliances in rural Pakistan. While&#13;
the reforms largely seek 'win-win' situations, the perceived (and in part, real) threat of loss of control over&#13;
the system, particularly by feudal landlords who are unaccustomed to sharing water and power, and by&#13;
irrigation bureaucrats with financial ties to these interests, who stand to benefit from the continuation of the&#13;
institutional status quo, could provoke strong adverse reactions. Large and povverful landlords view the&#13;
proposed transformation of PIDs into autonomous PIDAs and AWBs, the formation of FOs and the&#13;
transfer of management responsibilities of the tertiary system to these FOs, and the establishment of water&#13;
rights as potential threats to their traditional control over the irrigation and drainage system in particular,&#13;
and the social structure (feudal system) in general. Some sections of the PIDs, which when transformed&#13;
would be faced with a hard budget constraint, more accountability, financial transparency and scrutiny, and&#13;
possibly reduced costs and staffng, view the reforms as threats to their power, authority and rent-seeking&#13;
opportunities. Similarly, the proposed strategic reorientation of WAPDA which seeks to transform&#13;
WAPDA's role from large-scale construction to knowledge-based RBM, and the progressive transfer of its&#13;
construction activities in intra-provincial and on-farm infrastructure to PIDAs, AWBs and FOs, is viewed&#13;
53      Risk-mitigation factors/measures are factors/measures to reduce the probability of risk; while risk-&#13;
management strategies are measures which would be taken to minimize loss if the risk materializes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
by some officials as a diminution in WAPDA's role in management of the irrigation and drainage system.&#13;
There is a risk that these vested interests (who have very significant political and financial clout) would&#13;
slow, or even stop, reform. The proposed reforms have already provoked strong adverse reactions from&#13;
these opponents in the form of spreading misinformation, organizing political opposition, and bureaucratic&#13;
delays and stalling tactics including continuous whittling down of reform proposals at various stages.&#13;
5.15    Risk-mitigation: Demonstration of strong political commitment and leadership by the Borrower,&#13;
Provinces, and WAPDA to follow through with the institutional reforms, especially regarding&#13;
decentralization and management transfer of the irrigation and drainage system is crucial to mitigating this&#13;
risk. So far, this has been forthcoming. The ownership for the reforms at the highest levels is strong&#13;
especially since the institutional reform strategy was formulated by the Borrower based on its assessment&#13;
of the reforms' likely ownership by the people of Pakistan and chances of success in Pakistan's&#13;
environment. The reform program was first endorsed at the highest political levels on August 19, 199554;&#13;
and has been repeatedly re-endorsed at similar levels on several occasions by three successive&#13;
Governments (Federal and Provincial) since then, sometimes in the face of mounting opposition from&#13;
organized groups (notably large landholders, feudal landlords, and some officials of PIDs). The Borrower&#13;
and Provinces engaged in extensive consultations with the various stakeholders (including politicians,&#13;
organized farmer groups, Chambers of Agriculture, Provincial Departments, etc.) to build consensus and&#13;
win acceptance of the reform program, including on the PIDA Acts. The political and wide-ranging&#13;
support for the reform program was most recently demonstrated in the approval of the PIDA Acts by all the&#13;
four Provincial Assemblies and the reenactment of the PIDA Acts55. The extensive debate on the reform&#13;
strategy, wide-ranging consultations, and the resulting education about the reforms have lowered the&#13;
perceived threats of the reforms to some degree. The project's risk mitigation strategy is: (i) to continue to&#13;
encourage political debate about irrigation policy in Pakistan, and thereby help build both conscious top-&#13;
level political ownership and widespread support among the various stakeholders for the reform program;&#13;
(ii) strengthen the constituency for reforms through extensive technical assistance, communication and&#13;
beneficiary participation programs; and (iii) establish institutional focal points in the Federal Government&#13;
(e.g.: the FIDC), WAPDA (e.g.: NDP Coordination Cell, and possible Institutional Change Department),&#13;
and Provinces (e.g.: NDP Cells, transition wings in PIDAs and AWBs, and FOs) and provide technical&#13;
assistance to create the necessary incentives and mandates, and equip them with resources/capacity to&#13;
function as agents for institutional change. In spite of these measures, real institutional reform is by no&#13;
means assured. There is the danger that the PIDAs and AWBs could be captured by corrupt and&#13;
incompetent officials, and that the PIDAs and AWBs would lack the operational and financial autonomy to&#13;
function as effective institutions".&#13;
5.16    Risk-management Strategy: The project's risk management strategy (in the event that all or part&#13;
of the risk materializes) is two-fold: (i) IDA would only finance those PAs and Investment Projects which&#13;
conform to the institutional reform strategy. Specifically, the eligibility criteria for PAs provide for each&#13;
PIDA, AWB and FO to be eligible for incremental financing commitments only if it is established and&#13;
operated as an autonomous entity; and the selection criteria for Investment Projects provide for Investment&#13;
Projects to be financed only if they are carried out by PAs which have operational jurisdiction over the&#13;
Investment Project; (ii) the Borrower and IDA have agreed and understand that IDA's incremental&#13;
financing commitments for irrigation and drainage investments under NDP would be scaled back or&#13;
canceled altogether after the MTR if the pace of reforms is slow due to lack of government commitment,&#13;
implementation constraints, or resistance/lack of commitment by WAPDA, PIDAs or AWBs for real&#13;
change.&#13;
54     At a meeting involving the President, Prime Minister, the four Provincial Chief Ministers, Cabinet officials,&#13;
and Secretaries from the Borrower and all the four Provinces.&#13;
55     In the absence of Provincial Assemblies, the PIDA Statutes were originally promulgated as Ordinances in all&#13;
the four Provinces; and reenacted by the Provincial Assemblies after the general elections in February 1997.&#13;
56     Although the PIDA Acts have several provisions to ensure autonomy of PIDAs and AWBs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
5.17    Slow  or Imperfect Formation and Functioning of FOs: Effective FOs will ultimately be&#13;
essential for the financial sustainability of the irrigation and drainage system. FOs are crucial not only for&#13;
assuming responsibilities for O&amp;M of the tertiary system (i.e., on-farm drainage and irrigation upto the&#13;
minor/distributary level), but more importantly to ensure that that the AWBs and PIDAs are held&#13;
accountable for service delivery, maintenance of physical structures, and assessment of charges, and to&#13;
bring user discipline to water distribution. However, there is a risk that formation of FOs may be very slow&#13;
especially since the proposed FOs are to be established in a highly differentiated environment with respect&#13;
to land ownership, water rights and economic needs, and with a mixed record from Water Users&#13;
Associations and farmers' cooperatives. Feudal landlords could use their existing social power-hold to&#13;
frustrate social mobilization efforts and prevent formation of FOs. There is also a risk that the proposed&#13;
FOs could be dominated by feudal landlords, and thereby ineffective. Finally, there is a risk of legal&#13;
impediments that prevent the FOs from taking over management responsibilities for the tertiary system.&#13;
The loss in terms of equity, cost recovery, and ensuring accountability would be significant, and their&#13;
impacts on O&amp;M of the system (through losses on service quality and cost :recovery) would also be&#13;
significant. In addition, slow formation of FOs would also disrupt the strategy to improve O&amp;M of the&#13;
tertiary system by transferring responsibility to user groups. This would directly affect the fiscal savings&#13;
expected to be achieved through the project (estimated to be about Rs. 2.5 billion or US$62 million at&#13;
completion).&#13;
5.18    Risk-mitigation and Risk-management: The risk-mitigation factors are detailed below: (i) the&#13;
most important factor mitigating this risk is the expected encouragement from positive results of on-going&#13;
pilots of FOs. These pilots would also help to reduce the perceived threats to the i nterests of the opponents&#13;
of reforms in the sector. The early results from these pilot projects indicate that FOs are socially viable i.e.,&#13;
with appropriate social engineering techniques, it is possible to form user groups in the prevailing socio-&#13;
cultural and political environment. The pilots have also identified a need for these user groups to be&#13;
empowered and authorized to carry out economic activities i.e., to manage the tertiary level system57. The&#13;
project's farmer participation plan includes a special effort to replicate lessons from current pilots, and to&#13;
implement early action plans to build FOs; (ii) the selection criteria for Investment Projects provides an in-&#13;
built incentive for formnation of FOs (since the selection criteria specifies that on-farm drainage and&#13;
irrigation upto the minor/ distributary level would be carried out by FOs); (iii) the project's social&#13;
mobilization activities and awareness initiatives, the front-end cost-sharing arrangements for investments&#13;
(which would necessarily require consultation with beneficiaries), and assistance to the private sector for&#13;
providing contracting services for on-farm subsurface drainage facilities, would facilitate formation of&#13;
FOs; and (iv) the PIDA Acts clearly define the roles and responsibilities of FOs which include the&#13;
management of the tertiary system. The risk management strategy is the same as that indicated in para 5.16&#13;
above.&#13;
5.19    Quantitative Assessment of Political-Economy Risk:  A quantitative risk assessment of the&#13;
major institutional reforms was conducted58. This consisted of: (i) an evaluation of the potential winners&#13;
and losers from the reforms; (ii) identification of the various reform performance levels; (iii) identification&#13;
of means by which the various parties could influence the level of achievement of various reforms; and&#13;
(iv) identification of costs to (i.e., effort required by) each party to influence the achievement levels; and&#13;
thereafter using the Delphi approach to estimate probabilities of level of achievement of each reform. This&#13;
analysis indicated that the reform performance levels are likely to vary across reforms. The most likely&#13;
scenario is a medium level of (partial) achievement on reforms relating to: (i) institutional reforms in PIDs;&#13;
(ii) transfer of management responsibilities of the tertiary system to FOs; (iii) redefining the operational&#13;
jurisdictions of various PAs; and (iv) carrying out O&amp;M through Performance Contracts awarded to the&#13;
private sector; and a low level of achievement on establishment of water rights.&#13;
57      These lessons are drawn from the pilot project for farmer-managed irrigated agriculture under the LBOD&#13;
Project with technical assistance from IIMI (Moving Towards Participatory Irrigation Management - Phase II Report,&#13;
January 1997, IIMI).&#13;
58      Institutional Reforms in the Water Sector in Pakistan - Political Economy and Political Risk, Working Paper&#13;
for the National Drainage Program, May 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
5.20   Sustainability of Investments in Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure: Experience has&#13;
demonstrated that the key requirement for sustainability of irrigation and drainage projects in Pakistan is a&#13;
steady-state post-completion O&amp;M regime, with a reliable source of funding. As indicated earlier, the&#13;
proposed policy and institutional reforms are the most significant assurance for sustainability of&#13;
investments. There is however a risk that given that the institutional reforns may take many years to be&#13;
fully effective, the gains of the investments made in the interim period may not be sustainable, if real&#13;
institutional reform does not take place. To mitigate this risk, the project's design provides for institutional&#13;
reforms to precede investments in irrigation and drainage infrastructure.  Each Investment Project&#13;
(designed on a basin or sub-basin approach with a proper outfall) would virtually be a 'stand-alone'&#13;
investment. A reduction in the overall level of investments would not affect the economic viability of the&#13;
entire project. A related issue for sustainability of the system is a long-term solution for disposal of&#13;
drainage effluent outside the Indus Basin. The project would support the preparation of feasibility studies&#13;
and detailed design for the Borrower's proposed NSDS which is intended to create a permanent disposal&#13;
channel for drainage effluent via the LBOD into the Arabian Sea.&#13;
5.21   Implementation Delays: The other main risk to the project during its implementation phase is&#13;
slow implementation due to factors such as poor coordination, weak supervision, delays in preparation of&#13;
Investrnent Projects, delays in approval of contracts and investment projects, and failure of PAs to meet&#13;
eligibility criteria on schedule. To reduce these risks, authority and responsibility have been decentralized&#13;
significantly to PAs. The project is embedded in broad-based capacity building efforts for WAPDA,&#13;
PIDAs, AWBs, FOs, and PAD-OFWMs; and its design provides for extensive supervision and&#13;
implementation assistance. Finally, there are built-in mechanisms to ensure that there is a high degree of&#13;
client participation in the formulation and implementation of all the studies and research contracts. To&#13;
reduce the risks of delay, the contract with the NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants (who&#13;
would assist substantially in the preparation of Investment Projects) has been signed. Contracts for civil&#13;
works which would be carried out in the first year have been signed or are in an advanced stage (post bid-&#13;
evaluation) of procurement processing. Several research contracts are also in an advanced stage of&#13;
procurement processing and are expected to be signed before Effectiveness.&#13;
5.22   Sensitivity Analysis for Investment Projects: The illustrative economic analysis carried out for&#13;
a sample of the project's interventions demonstrated that the economic viability of the Investment Projects&#13;
is fairly robust. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the effects on economic viability of: (i)&#13;
delays in project benefits resulting from slow implementation; (ii) increases in project costs resulting from&#13;
inefficient management and other factors; (iii) lower than predicted yields for major crops; and (iv) lower&#13;
prices for major commodity outputs; and (v) a shorter duration of project benefits. The analysis indicated&#13;
that the economic viability would be affected only with large adverse changes in these variables.&#13;
D. KEY INDICATORS AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.23    Key Performance Indicators: Key Performance Indicators are presented in Annex 10. These&#13;
include input and process indicators, output indicators, and outcome and impact indicators for all&#13;
components of the project. The Borrower would maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to&#13;
monitor and evaluate on an on-going basis, in accordance with these indicators, the carrying out of the&#13;
Project and achievement of its objectives.&#13;
5.24   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E): The M&amp;E program would: (i) focus on key performance&#13;
indicators; (ii) cover the entire Indus Basin; and (iii) adopt an unified approach encompassing physical,&#13;
socio-economic, and environmental parameters. A number of baseline surveys and compilation of data&#13;
from recent surveys on salinity, agro-ecological conditions, and socio-economic conditions would be&#13;
conducted in the initial period of project implementation. The monitoring program would include&#13;
continuous assessment of project implementation in relation to agreed schedules; use of inputs,&#13;
infrastructure, and services by project beneficiaries; physical parameters such as depth-to-watertable and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
soil salinity; client assessment of the institutional programs; and socio-economic benefits to the farming&#13;
community from project interventions. It would be an integral part of the project's management. Its main&#13;
objectives would be to provide continuous feedback on implementation, and to identify actual or potential&#13;
successes and problems as early as possible to facilitate timely adjustments to project operation. The&#13;
purpose of the evaluation program would be to provide periodic assessment of the relevance, performance,&#13;
efficiency, and impact (both expected and unexpected) of the project in relation to its stated objectives. The&#13;
M&amp;E Program would include the Annual Review, MTR, ICR and Impact Evaluation. The MTR of the&#13;
project (including the functioning of the PIDAs, AWBs and FOs) would be completed not later than&#13;
December 31, 2000. The MTR would review progress of the first three years of project implementation&#13;
and provide a diagnosis of the likely effects of the project. It would identify project design and&#13;
implementation problems, re-evaluate the objectives, strategies, and targets, and propose solutions. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be completed not later than six months after the Closing&#13;
Date of the Project. Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that the Borrower would prepare the&#13;
Impact Evaluation Report for the project within three years of the project's Closing Date.&#13;
5.25    WAPDA, through its proposed Monitoring and Research Division, will coordinate M&amp;E&#13;
arrangements. WAPDA would establish and maintain an effective M&amp;E organization and system for the&#13;
project as a whole. In order to take advantage of the experience and capacities of various institutions&#13;
which have undertaken or have capability for monitoring, evaluation, and research in irrigation, drainage,&#13;
and socio-economic impact, WAPDA would establish collaborative arrangements with various institutions&#13;
such as provincial institutes, universities, and research institutes and NGOs (e.g. Applied Economic&#13;
Research Center, Sindh Development Studies Center, Punjab Economic Research Institute, Punjab&#13;
Irrigation Institute, Sindh Agricultural Research Institute, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics,&#13;
Faisalabad University, and selected PRIs). WAPDA would engage consultants as needed to assist in the&#13;
M&amp;E program including design of the M&amp;E program, capacity building and training for the M&amp;E units of&#13;
the PAs (notably provincial institutes, WAPDA's Watercourse Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate,&#13;
WAPDA's SCARPs Monitoring Organization, etc.). Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that&#13;
WAPDA would engage M&amp;E Consultants with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA by&#13;
June 30, 1998.&#13;

SPONSORING AGENCIES&#13;
3.     As indicated in para 2(s) above, Investment Projects would be eligible for financing under the project only&#13;
if they are carried out/sponsored by PAs which have the jurisdiction over the category of Investment Projects. PAs&#13;
would also carry out Investment Projects for which they have been contracted by any other PA (with operational&#13;
jurisdiction over the Investment Project) under the terms of a 'Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreement'&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. In particular:&#13;
(a)    WAPDA's Water Wing would ideally sponsor Investment Projects that are:&#13;
(i)    of an inter-Provincial nature;&#13;
(ii)    an integral part of LBOD or RBOD;&#13;
(iii)   contracted under a "Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreement" with a client on&#13;
terms satisfactory to IDA; and&#13;
(iv)    estimated to cost no less than $5 million equivalent.&#13;
(b)    PIDAs would ideally sponsor Investment Projects that are:&#13;
(i)    for the purpose of improving the PIDAs' ability to obtain or receive water from barrages&#13;
for delivery to AWBs at canal headworks;&#13;
(ii)   for the purpose of improving the PIDAs' ability to obtain or receive drainage effluent&#13;
from AWBs at outfalls for delivery to inter-Provincial drains or outfalls maintained and&#13;
operated by WAPDA's Water Wing;&#13;
(iii)   part of the PIDAs' paid responsibility on behalf of the Province for flood control or flood&#13;
damage rehabilitation;&#13;
(iv)    contracted under a "Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreement" with a client on&#13;
terms satisfactory to IDA; and&#13;
(v)    estimated to cost no less than $3 million equivalent.&#13;
(c)    AWBs would ideally sponsor Investment Projects that are:&#13;
(i)    for the purpose of improving the AWBs' ability to obtain or receive water from canal&#13;
headworks operated by PIDAs for delivery to FOs at distributaries or minors;&#13;
(ii)    for the purpose of improving the AWBs' ability to obtain or receive drainage effluent&#13;
from FOs at outfalls operated by AWBs for delivery by the AWBs to inter-Provincial&#13;
drains or outfalls maintained and operated by PIDAs;&#13;
(iii)   part of the AWBs' paid responsibility on behalf of the PIDA for flood control or flood&#13;
damage rehabilitation;&#13;
(iv)    contracted under a "Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreement" with that client&#13;
on terms satisfactory to IDA; and&#13;
(v)    estimated to cost no less than $1.0 million equivalent.&#13;
(d)    FOs would ideally sponsor Investment Projects that are:&#13;
(i)    for the purpose of improving FOs' ability to obtain or receive water from distributaries or&#13;
minors for delivery to Water Users Associations (WUAs) at minors or watercourses;&#13;
(ii)    for the purpose of improving the FOs' ability to obtain or receive drainage effluent from&#13;
WUAs or Drainage Beneficiary Groups (DBGs) at outfalls for delivery to drains or&#13;
outfalls maintained and operated by AWBs;&#13;
(iii)   part of the FOs' paid responsibility on behalf of the AWBs for flood control or flood&#13;
damage rehabilitation;&#13;
(iv)    contracted under a "Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreement" with clients on&#13;
terms satisfactory to IDA;&#13;
(v)    for replacement of saline SCARP tubewells with tile drains;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 9&#13;
(vi)   for replacement of FGW SCARP tubewells with community tubewells;&#13;
(vii)  for improvements of watercourses in saline groundwater areas; and&#13;
(viii)  estimated to cost no less than $0.1 million equivalent.&#13;
THE INVESTMENT PROJECT APPROVAL CYCLE&#13;
4.     A feasibility report would be prepared for each Investment Project and endorsed by NDP Engineering&#13;
Design and Supervision Consultants. The Feasibility Reports would confirm and document that the Investment&#13;
Projects meet the selection criteria outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.&#13;
5.     IDA would formally approve all Investment Projects that have estimated costs of $5 million or more,&#13;
regardless of the source of financing, subsequent to their appraisal by an Independent Panel of Experts. All other&#13;
Investment Projects would be approved by the NDP Coordination Cell or Provincial NDP Cell, and reviewed by&#13;
IDA retroactively. Investment Projects so reviewed which do not meet eligibility criteria would be ineligible for&#13;
financing.&#13;
6.     To ensure that IDA is consulted at early stages of the preparation process, rather than at a late stage, for&#13;
large projects or for projects with long preparation lead time, PAs would be encouraged to obtain IDA's approval on&#13;
a progressive basis, i.e., after each stage of the preparation process has been completed, for example:&#13;
formulation/identification; preparation of detailed Feasibility Study Report; appraisal by the NDP Engineering&#13;
Design and Supervision Consultants;); receipt of "no objection" of other interested parties (i.e. stakeholders)&#13;
including cofinanciers; signature of "Construction, Partnership and Handover Agreernent" between the PA and the&#13;
contracted agency (if any); preparation of detailed designs and tender documents of the designs; completion of land&#13;
acquisition, RAP, EIA, Social Assessment and other requirements; and completion of procurement procedures&#13;
including tender awards.&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR SCREENING INVESTMENT PROJECTS&#13;
7.     General Guidelines: All Investment Projects funded under NDP would meet criteria to ensure that&#13;
drainage schemes are sustainable, have positive returns to the national economy, have no significant negative&#13;
environmental impacts, have minimum financial burden on the Government, and involve beneficiary participation&#13;
and consultation during the entire Investment Project cycle. Detailed technical criteria for identification, ranking,&#13;
and selection are given in Annexes D and N of the Feasibility Report. As a general rule, before any Investment&#13;
Project is submitted for screening and selection for funding, in addition to traditional technical and economic&#13;
Investment Project feasibility considerations, the following eligibility criteria would ideally be met:&#13;
(a)    beneficiary participation and consultation plan in case of tertiary drainage or private tile drainage&#13;
Investment Projects;&#13;
(b)    Environmental Assessment with mitigation measures incorporated into Investment Project design;&#13;
(c)    Resettlement Action Plan with social rehabilitation dimensions;&#13;
(d)    adequate provision and budget for post-completion operations and maintenance;&#13;
(e)    community ownership and cost-sharing arrangements;&#13;
(f)    basin strategy;&#13;
(g)    hand-over arrangements, where applicable; and&#13;
(h)    awareness campaign directed at beneficiaries.&#13;
8.     Guidelines for Screening at Formulation Stage: The Investment Projects would be formulated by any&#13;
interested party or sponsor such as the Federal, Provincial or Local government bodies, farmers or other beneficiary&#13;
groups, or NGOs. The Investment Projects would be consistent with NDP objectives and be located in areas where&#13;
there are significant adverse conditions resulting from stormwater runoff, high watertable or soil salinity. In&#13;
addition, preference would be given to Investment Projects located in those areas where there are sufficient&#13;
resources, including irrigated water, an established Area Water Board, and organizations of farmers, that would&#13;
allow the benefits from drainage to be realized. At the Investment Project formulation stage, priority would ideally&#13;
be given to drainage requiring drainage with the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
(a)    located in highly developed irrigated zones with potentially high "gross margins," i.e., zones with&#13;
high cropping intensity, high yields, and cash crops; and&#13;
(b)    where over a 3-5 year period, the yields have been static or decreasing, the total cropped area is&#13;
falling, and farmers are shifting to cropping patterns that have lower returns.&#13;
9.     At the formulation stage, every effort would ideally be made to exclude any Investment Projects:&#13;
(a)    that do not have effective outfall to the main drainage system;&#13;
(b)    that require reclamation of highly sodic soils;&#13;
(c)    in abandoned areas, especially when cropping intensity in other areas not as severely affected can&#13;
be increased and irrigation water is scarce;&#13;
(d)    where salts would be mobilized from groundwater without adequate drainage outlet for safe&#13;
disposal;&#13;
(e)    that would have serious environmental impacts or problems which cannot easily be mitigated by&#13;
measures included within the project definition; and&#13;
(f)    that do not have a plan and budget for an awareness campaign concerning the benefits of drainage&#13;
and improved water management directed at beneficiaries.&#13;
10.    Guidelines for Screening at Feasibility Stage: In a situation where the number of candidate Investment&#13;
Projects is too large to allow all of them to be taken forward to the feasibility analysis stage, the following criteria&#13;
would be used for prioritizing Investment Project candidates:&#13;
(a)    Main off-farm drains: Only those that have lost at least 30 percent of their carrying capacity&#13;
would be included. Priority would normally be given based on the following criteria in&#13;
descending order:&#13;
(i)    where farmers are willing to rehabilitate subdrains on self-help basis and undertake&#13;
subsequent O&amp;M;&#13;
(ii)    waterlogged area in a highly developed irrigated zone;&#13;
(iii)   stormwater drains in cotton-wheat zone; and&#13;
(iv)    other irrigated areas.&#13;
(b)    On-farm drains: All existing and new tributary drains with outfalls discharge less than 15 cusecs&#13;
would be given priority if they are to be rehabilitated or constructed under a community tertiary&#13;
drainage scheme or private tile drainage scheme. In this subcategory, priority would ideally be&#13;
given to (in descending order):&#13;
(i)    those Investment Projects with existing environmentally acceptable outfalls;&#13;
(ii)    areas underlain by saline groundwater (SGW) (for subsurface drainage); and&#13;
(iii)    Fresh groundwater (FGW) areas with poor aquifer.&#13;
(c)    Drainage tubewells (SGW): Reduction in discharge and specific capacity should ideally be&#13;
taken into account. SGW tubewell replacement and rehabilitation would only be considered if tile&#13;
drainage is not technically feasible; and if there is an environmental acceptable disposal&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
11.    Economic Analysis: All Investment Projects that pass feasibility stage would be subject to a detailed&#13;
economic analysis before consideration for funding under NDP. The analysis would closely follow the Planning&#13;
Commission's revised Guidelines dated October 1995 for preparing projects in the water sector (which include&#13;
social, environmental, hand-over, land acquisition and resettlement, and post-completion O&amp;M aspects). To be&#13;
considered for funding under NDP, an Investment Project should have an economic rate of return (ERR) of at least&#13;
15%3 and a positive benefit/investment ratio.&#13;
3      The Opportunity Cost of Capital in Pakistan is estimated to lie somewhere between 12-15 %.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
12.    The guidelines are summarized in Table 1. A drainage technology selection flowchart is given in Figure 1.&#13;
The environmental evaluation procedures are given in Figure 2.&#13;
13.    The NDP Information System would be used to support analysis of the Investment Projects. In particular&#13;
Cost Tables, Indus Basin Model Revised (IBMR)4, and the geographical information system would be used to check&#13;
the validity and consistency of cost and benefit estimates, descriptions of the project area and affected lands, and&#13;
identification and assessment of environmental impacts. The Plan Generator component of the NDP Informaticn&#13;
System would also be used to simulate an objective comparison of the worth of altermative Investment Projects to&#13;
derive plans which are optimal within the assumed budgetary constraints.&#13;
14.    Least-Cost Slice-and-Package Investment Projects: To ease the administrative burden and expedite&#13;
approval, Investment Projects whose costs are estimated by the sponsors and confirmed by the NDP Coordination&#13;
Cell or Provincial NDP Cell to cost below $10 million would be implemented on the basis of least-cost slice-and-&#13;
package procedures under which standard costs and other uniformly applicable criteria would be applied to the&#13;
evaluation, financing, and implementation of the Investment Projects. Such procedures would be developed for all&#13;
categories of Investment Projects, but are expected to be applied most frequently for on-farm drainage; lining of&#13;
watercourses in SGW areas; transition of FGW tubewells; transfer, rehabilitation or construction of subdrains;&#13;
installation of standard measurement, gauging and control equipment; O&amp;M Performance Contracts; repetitive&#13;
consultancy packages for identical services or clients; repetitive equipment and machinery for identical clients or&#13;
purposes; training; and for eligible procurement and expenditures of AWBs, FOs, NGOs, WUAs, DBGs, and&#13;
community organizations. The NDP Coordination Cell, working in coordination with Provincial NDP Cells, wou].d&#13;
submit and agree with IDA annually: (i) the package of Investment Projects; and (ii) standard guidelines and unit&#13;
rates for implementation of projects under the Least-Cost Slice-and-Package approach.&#13;
4       To support the economic analysis, IBMR would be used in a revised form to simulate the direct and indirect impacts of&#13;
the investment project on the cropping pattem, resource use, farmers' income, and labor requirements vis-a-vis changes in&#13;
salinity and watertable. The revised version of IBMR would include upgrading and validation of the IBMR at the micro&#13;
(project) level to represent the impacts of individual investment projects within an agro-climatic zone, including more accurate&#13;
agricultural production data, yield-salinity and yield-watertable coefficients, and land use and cropping decisions. The model&#13;
would also be further refined to model lateral flows and evaporation.&#13;

PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT&#13;
ASPECTS TO BE COVERED IN PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS&#13;
1. Introduction: This Annex sets out the aspects which would be covered in Participation Agreements&#13;
between Provinces and PIDAs, AWBs and FOs participating in the Project. The Participation Agreements&#13;
would be between the concemed Province and the PIDA, AWB or FO to which funds from the Project are&#13;
being provided by the Province concerned. A separate Participation Agreement would be signed with each&#13;
PIDA, AWB or FO. Legal Counsel financed under the Project, or NDP Consultants would provide&#13;
assistance required by the Provinces, PIDAs, AWBs, or FOs in preparing and negotiating the Participation&#13;
Agreement on request by the Province/PIDA, AWB or FO.&#13;
2. Effectiveness: The Participation Agreement would become effective upon the date of its signature or&#13;
on the Effective Date of the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement for NDP, whichever is&#13;
later.&#13;
3. Compliance with Other Agreements: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would comply with the&#13;
provisions of all relevant sections of the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement for the&#13;
project signed with IDA, and with similar agreements with ADB and OECF for the project.&#13;
4. Eligibility for Incremental Financing Commitments: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned shall&#13;
furnish with respect to each Fiscal Year of Project implementation, evidence to IDA, showing that they are,&#13;
and shall continue during such Fiscal Year to be, in compliance with the eligibility criteria set forth in&#13;
Schedule 1 to the Project Agreement (these eligibility criteria are outlined in Annex 6 of the SAR). The&#13;
PIDA, AWB or FO would be eligible for incremental financing commitments from the IDA Credit for new&#13;
programs of activities to be commenced under the Project, and any new contracts to be awarded by it for&#13;
on-going Investment Projects only after it has furnished this evidence.&#13;
5. Organization and Functions: The PIDA, AWBs or FO would: (i) maintain organizational structure,&#13;
functions, staffing, and regulatory framework, all satisfactory to IDA, for the period of project&#13;
implementation and post-completion monitoring; and (ii) promptly inform IDA of any proposed change in&#13;
the organizational structures, functions, staffing, or regulatory framework.&#13;
6. Autonomy, Accountability, and Efficiency: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would be: (i)&#13;
established and run as an autonomous entity; (ii) established and run in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
business practice, under which Owners (whether Provinces or farmers), Board of Directors, and&#13;
Management would be completely separate; and (iii) audited by Chartered Accountants appointed in&#13;
consultation with IDA.&#13;
7. Recruitment of Managing Directors and Senior Officers of PIDAs, AWBs and FOs: The PIDA or&#13;
AWB concerned would recruit Managing Directors and Senior Officers from PIDs and/or the market&#13;
through transparent processes (i.e., including by advertising in the press, and the use of specialized&#13;
professional management recruitment firms). Managing Directors and Senior Officers would be acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
8. Staffing Levels: The PIDA or AWB concerned would prepare and implement a "Staffng,&#13;
Operational and Financial Plan"; impose a hiring freeze; reassign staff; and encourage voluntary retirement&#13;
until it achieves the desired staffing levels.&#13;
9. Regulatory and Corporate Oversight: The PIDA concerned would: (i) establish a Policy &amp;&#13;
Regulation Wing; and (ii) assign responsibility for establishing policy and regulating the operations of&#13;
entities to the Wing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

10. Legal Cell: The PIDA concerned would establish a Legal Cell with Tenns of Reference and staff,&#13;
including Chief Legal Counsel/Officer, agreed with IDA, to advise on regulatory and legal matters relating&#13;
to the decentralized irrigation and drainage system.&#13;
Operations&#13;
11. Management Transfer: The management of the irrigation and drainage system in the operating&#13;
jurisdiction of the PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would be legally transferred to it through leases or other&#13;
contractually enforceable mechanism which shall have been established by the Province in consultation&#13;
with IDA. The operating jurisdiction of the PIDA, AWB or FO would be as given below:&#13;
(a)    FO: (i) on-farm drainage; and (ii) on-farn irrigation upto minor/distributary level;&#13;
(b)    AWB: intra-provincial irrigation and drainage within its canal command (other than on-&#13;
farm drainage and irrigation); and&#13;
(c)    PIDA: (i) intra-provincial irrigation and drainage outside canal commands; and (ii) intra-&#13;
provincial irrigation and drainage within canal commands in which AWBs have not been&#13;
established (other than on-farm drainage and irrigation). This would be an interim&#13;
arrangement until AWBs have been established in all canal comamands.&#13;
12. Service Standards: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would adhere to a clear set of service&#13;
standards which shall have been agreed with its clients, and which shall be monitorable and contractually&#13;
enforceable.&#13;
13. Streamlining and Cost Reduction in Operations of Decentralized Irrigation Institutions: The&#13;
PIDA, AWB, or FO concerned would implement measures aimed at reducing O&amp;M costs, and thereby&#13;
reduce the cost recovery base including: (a) formulating new service regulations and personnel policies; (b)&#13;
streamlining machine operations; (c) updating and revising service and technical manuals; (d) improving&#13;
accounting and financial management systems; (e) conducting specific diagnostic analyses and&#13;
implementing subsequent action plans to streamline operations of selected drainage circles; (f) streamlining&#13;
fmancing and utilization of the O&amp;M budget - inter alia by linking O&amp;M financing with collection of&#13;
Abiana (the financing aspect of streamlining) and increasing the share of works in the budget (the&#13;
utilization aspect of streamlining) in selected pilot areas; (g) streamlining implementation of off-farm&#13;
drainage O&amp;M through Performance Contracts (PCs) or Rehabilitate and Operate Contracts (ROCs) or&#13;
other scheme awarded to the private sector on competitive basis, and designating Drainage Circles for PCs;&#13;
(h) initiating pilots to test decentralization of Abiana assessment and collection during implementation of&#13;
NDP, and designating Circles where pilots to test decentralization of Abiana assessment and&#13;
implementation would be implemented; (i) rationalizing "Abiana" schedule; (j) building their capacities for&#13;
delivery of services under the new framework; (k) transferring on-farm drains and tertiary drains to FOs&#13;
and WUAs; and (I) transitioning as many FGW tubewells as possible.&#13;
14. Delivery and Pricing for Wholesale Irrigation and Drainage Services: The PIDA, AWB, or FO&#13;
concerned would design, test/pilot, and if successful, implement a system of demand, delivery, and&#13;
payment of wholesale irrigation and drainage services all based on advance planning prior to the&#13;
agricultural seasons. Under such a system, PIDAs would eventually deliver services to AWBs based on the&#13;
aggregate demand from them, while AWBs would do likewise based on aggregate demand from FOs, who&#13;
would base theirs on the demand from WUAs. Payment would be determined through negotiations at these&#13;
aggregate levels as well; and losses (arising from operational inefficiencies arising from mismanagement&#13;
and/or overstaffing, non-recovery of charges, leakages due to corruption, or system losses due to excessive&#13;
seepage or poor maintenance) would be absorbed by the responsible parties, and not transmitted system-&#13;
wide. PIDAs would have the power to set water charges to AWBs only; aind would sell wholesale&#13;
irrigation and drainage services to them on a full cost-recovery basis. PIDAs' receivables from individual&#13;
AWBs would be independent of AWBs' receipts from FOs; and losses would not be transferred from one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

AWB to another. PIDAs would compensate AWBs for services for which AWBs are not expected to&#13;
recover costs; or which they carry out at the behest or direction of PIDAs. AWBs would similarly set&#13;
wholesale charges and deliver services to, and obtain payment from, individual FOs; and FOs would do so&#13;
likewise with WUAs.&#13;

Allocation Committee, or WAC" for each point of off-take (i.e., from barrages to canal headworks, from&#13;
headworks to distributaries, and from distributaries to watercourses) to improve the transparency of&#13;
allocation of irrigation supplies. The WACs would publish annually or more regularly in the local press&#13;
and in the Provinces' or Districts' official gazette the allocations of irrigation supplies, with comparisons of&#13;
rated/authorized versus actual allocations.&#13;
22. Public Participation: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would establish Community Advisory&#13;
Committees (CACs) on various issues which require the local knowledge, advisory inputs and active&#13;
participation of NGOs, farmers' associations, local community leaders and other stakeholders to help them&#13;
manage better the interface of the project with impacted communities including, but not limited to, land&#13;
acquisition, environment, protection of local wetland resources and similar interventions which may be&#13;
important to the livelihoods of local communities. The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would hold at least&#13;
one consultative and informative public meeting in March before the formulation of the year's work&#13;
program and budget; and during the middle of the fiscal year to brief the stakeholders about the progress in&#13;
implementing the year's work program and budget.&#13;
23. Procurement: The PIDA, AWB or FO concerned would follow the World Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines and standard bidding documents for procurement of all works, goods and services which would&#13;
be funded by IDA under the Project; and the ADB's and OECF's procurement guidelines for procurement&#13;
&#13;

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.     Procurement Assessment: The Borrower and IDA have carried out a "Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment for Pakistan" in 1995; and the Report is expected to be published soon. The Assessment&#13;
Mission concluded that the procurement policies and practices of all the major Executing Agencies for the&#13;
project (including WAPDA and Provinces) need to be brought into compliance with IDA procurement&#13;
policies; but that the Borrower and WAPDA in particular had the potential to implement these policies&#13;
satisfactorily. A number of changes have been agreed to be made to the procurement documentation of the&#13;
Borrower and WAPDA, which would bring them in compliance with IDA's requirements.&#13;
2.     The NDP Procurement Unit: WAPDA would establish an NDP Procurement Unit with terms of&#13;
reference, staffing from WAPDA and procurement consultants, and budgets satisfactory to IDA. WAPDA&#13;
would appoint one or more consultants with internationally recognized professional qualifications in&#13;
procurement administration, from NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants or other&#13;
consultants, as NDP Procurement Advisers to provide technical assistance and training to staff of WAPDA,&#13;
PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs on procurement. An NDP Procurement Manager (PM) will head the NDP&#13;
Procurement Unit which will be established by the NDP Cell. The PM will be the Deputy Chief Resident&#13;
Engineer (Contracts) of the NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants. The PM will develop&#13;
policies and procedures for the Procurement Unit, train the staff and promote effective use of the Credit&#13;
for project expenditures by Participating Agencies (PAs). To ensure consistency and quality in the&#13;
application of agreed procurement standards and procedures, the PM will prepare or endorse all&#13;
procurement documents by PAs before they are submitted to IDA. The overall responsibility for&#13;
procurement under the project will be with the NDP PM and his Regional Deputy PMs (DPMs). The PM&#13;
will manage procurement and other aspects of the project in a highly decentralized manner. The NDP&#13;
Procurement Unit, through its Regional Offices, would endorse procurement recommendations of PA line&#13;
managers to IDA for its no objection, before contracts are awarded.&#13;
3.     The Borrower's Procurement Review Arrangements: The Appraisal Mission concluded that&#13;
the Borrower, WAPDA, prospective PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs would be capable of handling procurement,&#13;
supervising contract administration, and engaging and supervising consultants envisaged under NDP with&#13;
the help of procurement consultants and establishment of the NDP Procurement Unit. WAPDA, Provinces,&#13;
and PAs would significantly delegate and decentralize the responsibility and authority for approval of&#13;
procurement decisions. For example, the representatives of the PA concerned with procurement (e.g.&#13;
Central Contracts Cell in the case of WAPDA), of the PAs' line manager (e.g. concerned General Manager&#13;
in the case of WAPDA or Chief Engineer in the case of PIDAs and AWBs), and a representative of the&#13;
NDP Coordinator, would be represented at the decision meeting at which the Procurement Committee&#13;
would make the recommendation for award, prior to its submission to IDA. The Procurement Committee&#13;
would be required to convey its decisions regarding procurement brought to it within a specific period.&#13;
Since approval of contracts by the WAPDA Authority (equivalent of Board) is the primary cause of delays&#13;
in procurement in projects implemented by WAPDA, WAPDA would: (i) delegate final approval authority&#13;
for all procurement for civil works contracts below $20 million, goods contracts below $10 million, and&#13;
consultancy contracts below $10 million which are frnanced under the project and implemented by&#13;
WAPDA to a "NDP Procurement Review Sub-committee" of the Authority established under the&#13;
respective General Manager, and with representation from the NDP Procurement Unit. The Central&#13;
Contracts Cell (CCC) of WAPDA would be represented on the subcommittee. All contracts above these&#13;
thresholds which will be implemented by WAPDA would be referred to the WAPDA Authority (equivalent&#13;
of Board); and (ii) delegate powers to the NDP Program Coordinator to approve up to 80 percent of the&#13;
procurement values which are expected to require WAPDA's approval under the project'. Authority for&#13;
I      Since Negotiations, WAPDA has proposed the following alternative arrangement: "WAPDA in consultation&#13;
with IDA, would: (i) establish an NDP Procurement Unit with staffing from WAPDA, Procurement Consultants and&#13;
Finance; (ii) appoint a Consultant with internationally recognized professional qualification in procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71                                       ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
approving procurement decisions for contracts implemented by PIDAs and AWBs would rest with the&#13;
Engineer. IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under IDA Credits would be followed for procurement of all&#13;
works and goods financed from the Credit. Consultants financed from the Credit would be selected&#13;
following IDA's Guidelines for Selection and Use of Consultants.&#13;
4.     Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs): Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) jointly prepared by&#13;
IDA, the Borrower, and WAPDA for Pakistan will be completed and approved by both IDA and the&#13;
Borrower by the time this project becomes ready for implementation. IDA and the Borrower have agreed&#13;
that the SBDs would be used for all procurement of works, goods and consultants financed by the IDA&#13;
Credit. Pending the issuance of SBDs, all procurement which is processed prior to that date would be on&#13;
the basis of existing IDA SBDs.&#13;
WORKS&#13;
5.     Procurement Method: All IDA-financed contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $5 million&#13;
or more would be procured using ICB procedures. Based on the currently identified and/or agreed package&#13;
of prospective civil works expenditures under various Investment Projects, it is expected that IDA-financed&#13;
civil works contracts amounting to $123.1 million equivalent will be procured using ICB procedures.&#13;
These works comprise individually lumpy contracts including: (a) rehabilitation and remodeling of the&#13;
LBOD Spinal Drain ($30.6 million); (b) remedial works on the Tidal Link ($11.7 million); (c) installation&#13;
of electrical lines, in Sanghar and Mirpurkhas districts ($1.8 million); (d) construction of the Chotiari&#13;
Reservoir ($26.6 million); (e) remodeling of the Nara Canal (23.7 million; 3 contracts); (f) works on the&#13;
Jamrao Canal ($6.3 million); (g) installation of control and telecommunicatio:n equipment in the Nara&#13;
Canal Command Area ($4.2 million); (h) installation of tile drains in Mirpurkhas ($9.1 million); and (i)&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of drainage infrastructure ($9.1 million, 3 contracts). Qualified domestic&#13;
bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in accordance&#13;
with IDA guidelines on procurement. IDA-financed contracts costing less than $5 million each would be&#13;
awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. The total estimated cost of such contracts is $66.6&#13;
million. These civil works comprise numerous packages of rehabilitation, small structures, earthworks and&#13;
operation and maintenance spread throughout the Indus Basin, and may be of limited interest to foreign&#13;
contractors. NCB has been used extensively for small civil works under all recent and ongoing irrigation&#13;
and drainage projects in Pakistan, and found to work satisfactorily under the right operating environment in&#13;
implementing agencies. However, there is much room for improvement in the procurement processing and&#13;
contract management practices and capacities of WAPDA and the PIDs (future PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs).&#13;
TIhe remaining IDA-financed civil works, mainly earthwork, masonry work, and[ small structures, will be&#13;
carried out by direct contracting, using project beneficiary labor (and/or materials) mobilized by FOs, with&#13;
progress payments based on unit prices agreed with IDA. While accurate estimates are currently not&#13;
available, these contracts are expected to aggregate $17.3 million equivalent.&#13;
6.     Procurement Review Thresholds: All pre-qualification documents and proposals would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review regardless of threshold. The following IDA-financed contracts would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review:&#13;
(a)    contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than $5 million equivalent;&#13;
(b)    the first NCB contract by each PA;&#13;
(c)    O&amp;M Performance Contracts, turnkey and supply-and-erect contracts (e.g. for dredging&#13;
equipment); and&#13;
(d)    contracts for borderline services such as GIS, aerial and satellite mapping.&#13;
administration as NDP Procurement Adviser; and (iii) constitute an NDP Procurement Review Committee headed by&#13;
the Regional General Manager comprising the Project Consultants and the NDP Project M[anager or his representative&#13;
to carry out one step evaluation of procurement contracts including works, goods and consultancy, where applicable.&#13;
The report of this Committee will be reviewed by CCC before approval from Managing Director (Water) or the&#13;
Authority as the case may be".&#13;
&#13;

72                                      ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
All IDA-financed contracts not subject to IDA's prior review would be subject to post review on a sample&#13;
basis.&#13;
7.     Procurement Documents: SBDs for Pakistan would be used after these are finalized by the&#13;
Borrower, WAPDA and IDA. Until these are finalized, IDA's SBDs for Procurement of Works would be&#13;
used for ICB contracts; and IDA's SBDs for Procurement of Works (Smaller Contracts) with modifications&#13;
agreed with IDA would be used for NCB contracts. Pre-qualification would be done using IDA's Standard&#13;
Pre-qualification Document for Works.&#13;
8.     Prequalification of Bidders for Works: Prequalification would be undertaken for all contracts&#13;
(or groups of contracts awarded on slice-and-package basis) estimated to cost $15 million or more.&#13;
Prequalification would be updated annually. Prequalification would be done using the IDA's Standard&#13;
Prequalification Documents for Works. Prequalification criteria would include financial strength, past&#13;
performance, availability of equipment and staff, and quality of the "method statement". The prequalified&#13;
contractor and supplier lists would be subject to IDA's "no objection", and only those prequalified would&#13;
be eligible to participate in the bidding. Where post-qualification is considered unavoidable, the same&#13;
criteria would be applied retrospectively in bid evaluation. All pre-qualification documents and proposals&#13;
would be subject to IDA's prior review regardless of threshold. The procurement process and&#13;
prequalification process have been initiated with the General Procurement Notice which was published in&#13;
April 1995.&#13;
GOODS&#13;
9.     Procurement Method: All IDA-financed contracts for goods costing $300,000 equivalent or&#13;
more would be procured using ICB procedures. These contracts would include steel, pumps, transformers,&#13;
generators, construction and O&amp;M equipment and machinery, communication and monitoring equipment&#13;
with an estimated total cost of $15.9 million. Qualified domestic bidders competing under ICB would be&#13;
eligible for a 15 percent preference in bid evaluation, or custom duties and import taxes payable by a non-&#13;
exempt importer, whichever is less. The remainder, mostly vehicles, would be procured through NCB&#13;
(estimated total cost: $2.4 million), except those contracts costing less than $50,000 (mostly office&#13;
equipment) which would be procured using National Shopping procedures (estimated total cost: $0.4&#13;
million).&#13;
10.    Procurement Review Thresholds for Goods: The following IDA-financed contracts would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review:&#13;
(a)    contracts for goods and equipment estimated to cost $300,000 or more;&#13;
(b)    the first NCB contract by each PA; and&#13;
(c)    contracts for borderline services such as GIS, aerial and satellite mapping.&#13;
All IDA-financed contracts not subject to IDA's prior review would be subject to post review on sample&#13;
basis.&#13;
11.    Procurement Documents: SBDs for Pakistan would be used after these are finalized by the&#13;
Borrower, WAPDA and IDA. Until these are finalized, IDA's SBDs for Procurement of Goods would be&#13;
used for contracts awarded using ICB procedures.&#13;
12.    Documents To be Reviewed Under Prior Review: In case of contracts for goods and works&#13;
subject to prior review, each of the following stages and related documentation in the procurement process&#13;
would be reviewed and commented upon by IDA before they are implemented by the Borrower or PA: (a)&#13;
advertising procedures; (b) pre-qualification invitation documents, and subsequent evaluation; (c) bidding&#13;
documents and addenda; (d) bid evaluation and the proposal for contract award; (e) contract documents, to&#13;
identify any differences from the proforma contract included in the bidding documents and to verify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73                                      ANNEX4&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
consistency with bid evaluation; and (f) material modifications to the contract during execution. Since the&#13;
project involves numerous procurements of similar goods, works, and services by all participating&#13;
agencies, most commercial documents would be common to similar items of procurement, and hence will&#13;
be reviewed once and then used repetitively. Only modifications to the standard document to suit specific&#13;
procurement, if any, would need to be submitted to IDA each time for prior review.&#13;
CONSULTANCY SERVICES&#13;
13.    The Services: IDA would finance the following consulting services: (i) NDP Design and&#13;
Engineering Supervision Consultants (about 8596 man-months); (ii) sector planning and policy studies&#13;
consultants; and (iii) financial management and information systems consultants; (iv) social design and&#13;
environmental consultants; (v) monitoring and evaluation consultants; and (vi) other individual long- and&#13;
short-term consultants e.g. for training, development communications, editorial specialists, panels of&#13;
experts, accounting and auditing, etc.&#13;
14.    Selection of Consultants: All consultants whose services are financed from the IDA Credit will&#13;
be selected by PAs in accordance with procedures outlined in "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) ". IDA's Standard Letter of&#13;
Invitation and Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services will be used for consultancy services.&#13;
15.    Prior Review: The following IDA-financed contracts would be subject to IDA's prior review:&#13;
(a)    consultancy contracts with firms with estimated cost of $100,000 or more, and with&#13;
individuals with estimated cost of $50,000 or more;&#13;
(b)    the first contract for appointment of consultants for each PA;&#13;
(c)    contracts with firms awarded on single-source basis; and&#13;
(d)    consultancy contracts for assignments of a critical nature (e.g., because of environmental,&#13;
safety, or public health considerations, Panels of Experts, Consultants for the Enhanced&#13;
Supervision Arrangements, Sector Planning and Research, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
including Environmental Monitoring and Audit, Social Assessments, Resettlement,&#13;
Environmental    Assessments,   Information     Systems,    and    Financial&#13;
Management/Accounting and Auditing), regardless of value.&#13;
Terms of reference for all IDA-financed consultancy contracts would also be subject to prior review,&#13;
regardless of value. All IDA-fnanced contracts which are not subject to prior review would be subject to&#13;
post review on sample basis.&#13;
16.    In case of consultancy contracts which are subject to IDA's prior review, the Borrower would&#13;
submit for IDA's review relevant documents at each stage of the process by which the Borrower selects&#13;
consulting fimns including: (a) preparation of terms of reference and budget; (b) choice of selection&#13;
procedure; (c) preparation of the shortlist; (d) Letter of Invitation; (e) submission of the winning proposal&#13;
or the evaluation report; and (f) negotiation of the draft contract.&#13;
17.    In view of their specialized capabilities, technology transfer and institutional/capacity building&#13;
experience, and good results from previous and ongoing technical cooperation services, WAPDA may&#13;
contract directly the services of agencies of some member countries to support its "Institutional Program&#13;
for WAPDA's Water Wing" subcornponent and to support its "Research Program" subcomponent. In&#13;
order to increase accountability of the research institutes carrying out the drainage research programs,&#13;
participating drainage research institutes would enter into contracts with WAPDA to carry out their&#13;
research programs with payments linked to defined outputs and maintenance of agreed standards and&#13;
criteria. It is expected that WAPDA would award about 13 such contracts ($12.9 million).&#13;
18.    In addition to the above provisions, the following would be reviewed by IDA (for goods, works,&#13;
and consultancy contracts):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                                       ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(a)    any case in which the procedures used are not transparent or award recommendation is&#13;
irregular;&#13;
(b)    any case in which a complaint has been raised;&#13;
(c)    any request for re-bidding;&#13;
(d)    standard procurement documents to be used under the project;&#13;
(e)    proposals for extension of bid validity, or delays in contract award;&#13;
(f)    all advance procurement action, advance contracting, and procurement relating to&#13;
retroactive financing for ICB and NCB contracts;&#13;
(g)    all contracts which are proposed to be awarded to entities, companies, or agencies which&#13;
are part of, owned or controlled by, the Borrower, its Provinces, WAPDA, or any other&#13;
PA; and&#13;
(h)    sole-source procurement contracts.&#13;
19.    Contracts Under Prior Review Threshold: Since only the indicative pipeline of Investment&#13;
Projects is known with any degree of firmness, the number of contracts which are likely to fall under the&#13;
prior review threshold cannot be determined at this stage, but is estimated to be about $123.1 million for&#13;
works (about 60% of IDA-financed contracts), $15.9 million for goods (85% of IDA-fmanced contracts),&#13;
$76.9 million for consultancy services (98% of IDA-fnanced contracts), and $14.2 million for research&#13;
contracts (100% of IDA-financed contracts). About 67% of all IDA-financed contracts would be covered&#13;
by prior review, which is below the desirable level of 80%, but is acceptable because it has been selected to&#13;
strike a balance between the work load for IDA on prior review and an acceptable coverage for IDA-&#13;
financed contracts in number and value, given the potentially large number of PAs (several Regions and&#13;
Divisions of WAPDA, 4 PIDAs, 4 PAD-OFWMs and many more AWBs and FOs) and the likelihood that&#13;
the project will consist of a large number of small contracts or packages (especially for Investment Projects&#13;
sponsored by FOs). Moreover, it is justified by the following circumstances: (i) the Borrower, WAPDA,&#13;
and Provinces have demonstrated experience and capacity in procurement matters on similar Bank-&#13;
financed projects; (ii) technical assistance would be provided under the project to support their&#13;
organizations and conduct prior review of procurement decisions of participating agencies; (iii) each&#13;
agency would execute a large number of similar repetitive contracts; (iv) IDA and other NDP donors&#13;
would conduct more intensive post reviews of procurement decisions based on documentation prepared by&#13;
the project's supervisory consultants; and (v) the Borrower's ability, and indicated willingness to accept&#13;
responsibility for the risk of misprocurement, resulting in cancellation of Credit proceeds.&#13;
20.    Post Review: The prior review will be complemented by post review of a random sample of&#13;
awarded contracts and procurement-related documentation below the prior review thresholds; in the&#13;
following proportions: (i) for works, I in 20 of an estimated 883 such contracts; (ii) for goods, I in 15 of&#13;
an estimated 125 such contracts; and (iii) for consultancy services, I in 5 of an estimated 100 such&#13;
contracts. The post review would cover the final contract and any evaluation of proposals and award&#13;
recommendations. In case misprocurement is detected during post review, IDA will immediately institute&#13;
a more intensive review of past and future contract documentation for procurement undertaken by the&#13;
concerned PA. Contracts financed under parallel financing arrangements (e.g., by OECF and ADB) would&#13;
also be subject to post review by IDA on a sample basis to ensure their compatibility with the balance of&#13;
the project, satisfactory quality, timely delivery or completion, and acceptable pricing.&#13;
21.    Review of Procurement Documents/Decisions in IDA: In most instances, IDA's review would&#13;
be carried out in the IDA's Resident Mission in Pakistan for completeness and adherence to IDA&#13;
procurement policies and guidelines. In cases where mandatory review is required by the IDA's Regional&#13;
Procurement Adviser or higher authority, an initial review would be carried out in the IDA's Resident&#13;
Mission in Pakistan for completeness and adherence to IDA procurement policies and guidelines, and&#13;
subsequently will be reviewed by the appropriate authority.&#13;

DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
1.     Disbursement Against SOEs: IDA would disburse against Certified SOEs for the following types&#13;
of expenditures:&#13;
(a)    on contracts for works of less than $5,000,000 equivalent;&#13;
(b)    on contracts for equipments and vehicles of less than $300,000 equivalent;&#13;
(c)    on contracts for consultants services of less than $100,000 in the case of firms, and less&#13;
than $50,000 in the case of individuals;&#13;
(d)    for training expenditure; and&#13;
(e)    for incremental staff and operating costs.&#13;
All other expenditures would be supported by full documentation.&#13;
2.     SOE Documentation: Supporting documents for SOEs would not be submitted to IDA, but&#13;
would be retained by the PAs and be available to IDA during supervision. Each SOE would be supported&#13;
by a financial statement, separating investment and recurrent costs by expenditure category (such as civil&#13;
works, goods, and operating costs). Documentation for SOEs would include sufficient information to&#13;
enable IDA Supervision Missions to: (a) ensure an effective ex-post field review of documentation; (b)&#13;
verify and compare work performed, goods delivered, services provided, and payments made; (c) prepare&#13;
summary reports on detailed Investment Project information; and (d) meet IDA's requirements for&#13;
reporting source-of-supply information. If during implementation, IDA determines that the administrative&#13;
capacity of any PA is inadequate for complying with IDA's requirements for SOE documentation and&#13;
procedures, the NDP FMIS Unit would prepare and implement a plan for improvements.&#13;
3.     Annual Field Review of SOEs: Not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year of&#13;
project implementation, the NDP FMIS Unit would prepare for IDA's review, a report titled "Field Review&#13;
of SOE Documents" covering the entire the project. The objectives of the Review would be to: (a) verify&#13;
that expenditures are eligible for IDA financing; (b) establish the sufficiency and accuracy of supporting&#13;
documents maintained by the PAs for SOE disbursements; (c) assess, through discussions with independent&#13;
auditors, the continuing adequacy of procedures, systems, and controls used to monitor expenditures; (d)&#13;
ensure that the procurement procedures outlined in the Credit Agreement are being followed; and (e)&#13;
ensure that the required arrangements for timely independent audit of SOEs have been made.&#13;
Special Accounts&#13;
4.     Special Accounts:  To facilitate disbursements, Special Accounts in US Dollars would be&#13;
established in the National Bank of Pakistan, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Ministry of Water &amp; Power: the Secretary, MW&amp;P, Islamabad, with an initial deposit of&#13;
up to $100,000, to finance the costs of Federal Coordination and Supervision. The initial&#13;
deposit would be $50,000 until the aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal&#13;
$200,000;&#13;
(b)    WAPDA:&#13;

aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $10 million;&#13;
(c)    Province of Sindh: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, Sindh Province, in Karachi or&#13;
Hyderabad, with an initial deposit of up to $5 million, to finance the costs of Provincial&#13;
Coordination, Institutional Reforms for PIDs, and Investment Component in Sindh&#13;
executed by the Province of Sindh. The initial deposit would be $2.5 million until the&#13;
aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $10 million;&#13;
(d)    Province of Punjab: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, Punjab Province, in Lahore, with&#13;
an initial deposit of up to $2 million, to finance the costs of Provincial Coordination,&#13;
Institutional Reforns for PIDs, and the costs of the Investment Component in Punjab&#13;
Province executed by the Province of Punjab. The initial deposit would be $1 million&#13;
until the aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $4 million;&#13;
(e)    NWFP: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, NWFP, in Peshawar, with an initial deposit of&#13;
up to $1 million, to finance the costs of Provincial Coordination and Institutional&#13;
Reforms for PIDs in NWFP executed by the NWFP. The initial deposit would be $0.5&#13;
million until the aggregate deposits into this Special Account equal $2 million; and&#13;
(f)    Province of Balochistan: the NDP Provincial Coordinator, Balochistan, in Quetta, with&#13;
an initial deposit of up to $0.5 million, to finance the costs of Provincial Coordination&#13;
and Institutional Reforms for PIDs in Balochistan Province executed by the Province of&#13;
Balochistan. The initial deposit would be $0.25 million until the aggregate deposits into&#13;
this Special Account equal $1 million.&#13;
5.     Expenditures to be Financed from the Special Account: The Special Account would be used to&#13;
finance all expenditures eligible for financing from the IDA Credit; and would not be used to finance&#13;
ineligible expenditure (such as duties and taxes, land acquisition, interest during construction, etc.).&#13;
6.     Replenishment: Withdrawal Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be&#13;
submitted on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special Account has been utilized, whichever&#13;
occurs earlier.&#13;
&#13;

the PIDA, adopt and implement policies aimed at promoting formation, growth and development of FOs.&#13;
18.    Coordinating Agency: Provinces would designate their Planning and Development Departments&#13;
or Planning and Development Boards (P&amp;DDs), as the Provincial NDP Cells, to coordinate and oversee the&#13;
decentralization and management transfer process.&#13;
19.    Decentralization and Management Transfer Process:  Each Province would prepare and&#13;
implement the decentralization and management transfer (MT) process including: (a) delineating the&#13;
physical boundaries of the proposed PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs taking into account hydraulic features of the&#13;
irrigation schemes, social aspects, and economies of scale which apply; (b) outlining the rights and&#13;
obligations of PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs and drafting applicable Statutes including the necessary rules and&#13;
regulations, constituting PIDAs, AWBs and FOs; (c) formally registering those PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs&#13;
that are formed under the project with the appropriate authority; (d) facilitating the involvement of users&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
85                                      ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
AWBs, and FOs jointly determine their technical and training needs; (j) carrying out the physical and legal&#13;
transfer of the system, infrastructure, machinery and equipment to the PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs; and (k)&#13;
implementing a Staffing, Operational and Financial Plan designed to address the concerns of staff and&#13;
labor of PIDAs which may arise, and where necessary, to assist their transition into other aspects of the&#13;
new entities' operations or elsewhere in order to ease the burden which the Institutional Program may&#13;
impose on the staff.&#13;
20.    Depending on technical and other considerations for viability, Provinces would establish AWBs&#13;
on each of Pakistan's canal commands, or on a combination thereof, beginning with pilots. Provinces&#13;
would also establish village-level FOs under the transition of FGW tubewells Investment Projects and&#13;
distributary level FOs. The overriding criteria for design of the distributary level FOs would be to establish&#13;
them at such sizes that would enable them to employ modern management skills, equipment, and&#13;
technology, optimize economic efficiency and financial viability, and equip/enable them to negotiate and&#13;
fulfill contract terms with AWBs and banks, subject to appropriate hydraulic and sociological limitations.&#13;
21.    Organization and Functions: Provinces would: (i) maintain PIDAs, AWBs and FOs under&#13;
organizational structures, functions, statutes, staffing, regulatory framework, all satisfactory to IDA, for the&#13;
period of project implementation and post-completion monitoring; and (ii) promptly inform IDA of any&#13;
proposed change in the organizational structures, functions, statutes, staffing, or regulatory framework.&#13;
22.    Streamlining and Cost Reduction in Operations of Decentralized Irrigation Institutions:&#13;
PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs would implement measures aimed at reducing O&amp;M costs, and thereby reduce the&#13;
cost recovery base including: (a) formulating new service regulations and personnel policies; (b)&#13;
streamlining machine operations; (c) updating and revising service and technical manuals; (d) improving&#13;
accounting and financial management systems; (e) conducting specific diagnostic analyses and implement&#13;
subsequent action plans to streamline operations of selected drainage circles; (f) streamlining financing and&#13;
utilization of the O&amp;M budget - inter alia by linking O&amp;M financing with collection of Abiana (the&#13;
financing aspect of streamlining) and increasing the share of works in the budget (the utilization aspect of&#13;
streamlining) in selected pilot areas; (g) streamlining implementation of off-farm drainage O&amp;M through&#13;
Performance Contracts (PCs) or Rehabilitate and Operate Contracts (ROCs) or other scheme awarded to&#13;
the private sector on competitive basis, and designating Drainage Circles for PCs; (h) initiating pilots to&#13;
test decentralization of Abiana assessment and collection during implementation of NDP, and designate&#13;
Circles where pilots to test decentralization of Abiana assessment and implementation would be&#13;
implemented; (i) rationalizing "Abiana" schedule; 0) building their capacities for delivery of services&#13;
under the new framework; transferring on-farm drains and tertiary drains to FOs and WUAs; and (k)&#13;
transitioning as many FGW tubewells as possible.&#13;
23.    Manuals: Provinces would: (i) prepare a "Manual of Operations" that would be specific to the&#13;
requirements of each Province, PIDA, AWB or FO; (ii) prepare a "Manual of Regulations for Autonomous&#13;
Bodies" in consultation with PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs; and (iii) prepare a "Manual of Regulations for FGW&#13;
Exploitation" in consultation with FOs that would be specific to the requirements of each Province.&#13;
24.    Study on Procedure for Pricing for Irrigation and Drainage Services: The Borrower and&#13;
Provinces would conduct a study on procedures for pricing of irrigation and drainage services in the&#13;
decentralized irrigation and drainage system. The study would, inter alia, examine mechanisms for&#13;
consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned (i.e., PIDA and AWB, or AWBs and FOs).&#13;
The study would be completed by June 30, 1998 and be implemented in the pilot AWB and FO areas by&#13;
December 31, 1998.&#13;
25.    Delivery and Pricing for Wholesale Irrigation and Drainage Services: PIDAs, AWBs, and&#13;
FOs would design, testlpilot, and if successful, implement a system of demand, delivery, and payment of&#13;
wholesale irrigation and drainage services all based on advance planning prior to the agricultural seasons.&#13;
Under such a system, PIDAs would eventually deliver services to AWBs baseid on the aggregate demand&#13;
from them, while AWBs would do likewise based on aggregate demand from FOs, who would base theirs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86                                      ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
on the demand from WUAs. Payment would be determined through negotiations at these aggregate levels&#13;
as well; and losses (arising from operational inefficiencies arising from mismanagement and/or&#13;
overstaffing, non-recovery of charges; leakages due to corruption; or system losses due to excessive&#13;
seepage or poor maintenance) would be absorbed by the responsible parties, and not transmitted system-&#13;
wide. PIDAs would have the power to set water charges to AWBs only; and would sell wholesale&#13;
irrigation and drainage services to them on a full cost-recovery basis. PIDAs' receivables from individual&#13;
AWBs would be independent of AWBs' receipts. from FOs; and losses would not be transferred from one&#13;
AWB to another. PIDAs would compensate AWBs for services for which AWBs are not expected to&#13;
recover costs; or which they carry out at the behest or direction of PIDAs. AWBs would similarly set&#13;
wholesale charges and deliver services to, and obtain payment from, individual FOs; and FOs would do so&#13;
likewise with WUAs.&#13;
26.    Recruitment of Managing Directors and Senior Officers of PIDAs, AWBs and FOs: PIDAs&#13;
and AWBs would recruit Managing Directors and Senior Officers from PIDs and/or the market through&#13;
transparent processes (i.e., including by advertising in the press, and the use of specialized professional&#13;
management recruitment firms). Managing Directors and Senior Officers would be acceptable to IDA.&#13;
27.    Accountability, Efficiency, and Autonomy: PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs established as part of the&#13;
project's Institutional Reform Program would be: (i) audited by Chartered Accountants appointed in&#13;
consultation with IDA; and (ii) established and run in accordance with generally accepted business&#13;
practice, under which Owners (whether Provinces or farmers), Board of Directors, and Management would&#13;
be completely separate.&#13;
28.    Regulatory and Corporate Oversight: Provinces would (i) establish a Policy &amp; Regulation&#13;
Wing of PIDAs when existing PIDs are decentralized into PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs; (ii) assign&#13;
responsibility for establishing policy and regulating the operations of entities in the sector to the Wing; and&#13;
(iii) prepare and agree with IDA the regulatory and corporate oversight mechanism for the decentralized&#13;
irrigation and drainage system by December 31, 1997.&#13;
29.    Legal Cell: Each PIDA would establish a Legal Cell with Terms of Reference and staff,&#13;
including Chief Legal Counsel/Officer, agreed with IDA, by December 31, 1997, to advise on regulatory&#13;
and legal matters relating to the decentralized irrigation and drainage system.&#13;
30.    Water Allocation Committees: To improve the transparency of allocation of irrigation supplies,&#13;
each PIDA, AWB, and FO would establish, a "Water Allocation Committee, or WAC" for each point of&#13;
off-take (i.e. from barrages to canal headworks, from headworks to distributaries, and from distributaries to&#13;
watercourses). The WACs would publish annually or more regularly in the local press and in the&#13;
Provinces' or Districts' official gazette the allocations of irrigation supplies, with comparisons of&#13;
rated/authorized versus actual allocations.&#13;
31.    Construction Partnership and Handover Agreements:  WAPDA would sign framework&#13;
"Construction Partnership and Handover Agreements" with PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs for which it intends to&#13;
construct facilities and which would later be handed over to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
32.    Business Plan: All PAs would prepare and implement "Three Year Rolling Business Plans". The&#13;
Plan would include procurement, staffing, operations, and financing plans.&#13;
33.    Project Preparation Guidelines: The Borrower's Planning Commission (Water Wing) would&#13;
update guidelines for selection, preparation, and evaluation of irrigation and drainage investment projects&#13;
to include "basin orientation", and to explicitly integrate social, environment, resettlement, handover, and&#13;
post-completion O&amp;M aspects.&#13;
34.    Provincial NDP Cells: Provinces would establish Provincial NDP Cells, each of which would be&#13;
headed by Provincial NDP Coordinators appointed by the ACS Development/Chairman of the P&amp;DD&#13;
Board with responsibility for day-to-day coordination and supervision of the project in the Province on&#13;
behalf of the ACS (Development)/Chairman P&amp;D Board. Provinces would re:locate the Provincial NDP&#13;
Cells to P&amp;DDs in order to reflect more closely the multi-agency design of the project.&#13;
35.    Procurement Management2: WAPDA, in consultation with IDA, would: (i) establish an NDP&#13;
Procurement Unit with terms of reference, staffing from WAPDA and procurement consultants and budget;&#13;
(ii) appoint one or more consultants with internationally recognized professional qualifications in&#13;
procurement administration as NDP Procurement Advisers; (iii) delegate final approval authority for all&#13;
procurement for civil works contracts below $20 million, goods contracts below $10 million, and&#13;
consultancy contracts below $10 million which are financed under the project and implemented by&#13;
WAPDA to a "NDP Procurement Review Sub-committee" of the Authoriity established under the&#13;
respective General Manager, and with representation from the NDP Procurement Unit; and (iv) delegate&#13;
powers to the NDP Program Coordinator to approve up to 80 percent of the procurement values which are&#13;
expected to require WAPDA's approval under the project.&#13;
36.    Procurement Plans: (i) WAPDA and Provinces will prepare detailed Three-Year Rolling&#13;
Procurement Plans as part of their Three-Year Rolling Business Plans; (ii) the NDP Coordination Cell in&#13;
WAPDA will consolidate the procurement plans of participating agencies, and submit the combined Three-&#13;
Year Rolling Procurement Plan for IDA's review and approval annually by March 31, together with the&#13;
project's Combined Business Plan; and (iii) Contracts for civil works will be considered only as part or&#13;
parts of complete Investment Projects and be awarded only after the Investment Projects have been&#13;
approved by IDA.&#13;
37.    Disbursements: The NDP FMIS Unit (an organizational arm of the NDP Coordination Cell and&#13;
NDP Provincial Cells) would prepare and submit Withdrawal Applications for eligible expenditures&#13;
financed by PAs to IDA within 180 days of the date of incurring the expenditure. Eligibility for such&#13;
expenditures for financing under the Credit would be limited to the cut-off date of 180 days. Where Special&#13;
Accounts are established or used, the Replenishment Applications would be subnmitted on a monthly basis.&#13;
38.    Community Supervision: All PAs would establish Community Advisory Committees (CACs)&#13;
on various issues which require the local knowledge, advisory inputs and active participation of NGOs,&#13;
farmers' associations, local community leaders and other stakeholders to help them manage better the&#13;
interface of the project with impacted communities including, but not limited to, land acquisition,&#13;
2      Since Negotiations, WAPDA has proposed the following alternative arrangement: "WAPDA in consultation&#13;
with IDA, would: (i) establish an NDP Procurement Unit with staffing from WAPDA, Procurement Consultants and&#13;
Finance; (ii) appoint a Consultant with internationally recognized professional qualification in procurement&#13;
administration as NDP Procurement Adviser; and (iii) constitute an NDP Procurement Rleview Committee headed by&#13;
the Regional General Manager comprising the Project Consultants and the NDP Project Manager or his representative&#13;
to carry out one step evaluation of procurement contracts including works, goods and consultancy, where applicable.&#13;
The report of this Committee will be reviewed by CCC before approval from Managing Director (Water) or the&#13;
Authority as the case may be".&#13;

environment, protection of local wetland resources and similar interventions which may be important to the&#13;
livelihoods of local communities.&#13;
39.    NDP Consultants: WAPDA would appoint one or more firms as NDP Consultants (including,&#13;
but not limited to, NDP Engineering Design and Supervision Consultants; and NDP Sector Planning and&#13;
Studies Consultants collectively referred to as NDP Consultants) to provide direct supervision of, and&#13;
implementation assistance to the PAs. WAPDA would cause NDP Consultants to establish a collective&#13;
Board of Management (BOM) consisting of the representatives of the organizations represented in the&#13;
NDP Consultants for coordination and supervision, and which would meet quarterly to review&#13;
implementation progress and deal with issues that may arise. WAPDA's General Manager (Planning)&#13;
would be an ex-officio member of the Board of Management. WAPDA would cause the Team Leaders of&#13;
the NDP Consultants to establish an Executing Committee, to which the BOM would delegate its&#13;
responsibilities and which would meet monthly.&#13;
40.    NDP Client Service Teams: WAPDA would ensure that staff of the NDP Units in WAPDA&#13;
Divisions (e.g. NDP Coordination Cell, FMIS Unit, NDP Procurement Unit/Cell, Social Cell), and of NDP&#13;
Consultants are deployed to assist or serve PAs only at the written request of the Chief Executive or&#13;
authorized representative of the PA. WAPDA would cause NDP Consultants, the PA's representative, and&#13;
counterpart staff of WAPDA Divisions' NDP Units to form "NDP Client Service Teams", whose task&#13;
would be to assist and supervise PAs on the basis of clear objectives, specific Terms of Reference, budgets,&#13;
schedules, and service indicators agreed between the NDP Coordination Cell and the PA's representative;&#13;
and which would be led by the representative of the PA (or failing, the nominee of the NDP Program&#13;
Coordinator).&#13;
41.    Evaluation Reports: The Chief Executives of PAs would complete one or more Evaluation&#13;
Reports using standardized formats, prepared by the NDP Coordination Cell (WAPDA) in consultation&#13;
with IDA, during and after the completion of each NDP Service Contract by the Client Service Team.&#13;
These evaluation reports would be compiled by the NDP Working Party with the assistance of NDP Sector&#13;
Planning and Studies Consultants.&#13;
42.    Operating Regulations: WAPDA's NDP Cell would formulate the Operating Regulations and&#13;
Manual of Procedures for the Project in close consultations with other PAs, and issue them to all PAs after&#13;
the endorsement of the Federal Program Steering Committee (FPSC) and IDA. The Operating&#13;
Regulations and Manual of Procedures would specify the general principles, terms and conditions for&#13;
financing under the project, roles and responsibilities of each PA, procedures for Investment Project&#13;
preparation and selection, eligibility criteria for PAs, eligible expenditures for financing, and a glossary of&#13;
terms. These Operating Regulations would be an integral part of the "Participation Agreement" to be&#13;
entered into between Provinces and PAs. WAPDA's NDP Cell would update the Operations Regulations&#13;
and Manual of Procedures periodically (at least annually).&#13;
43.    Participation Agreements: WAPDA (NDP Coordination Cell) and Provinces (Provincial NDP&#13;
Cells) would enter into "Participation Agreements" with PAs which are being financed by the project.&#13;
44.    Operational Manuals and Procedures: Each PA would develop detailed Operational Manuals&#13;
and Procedures in consultation with the NDP Design and Engineering Supervision Consultants for each&#13;
Investment Project; and submit them to IDA no later than one year prior to completion of the Investment&#13;
Project.&#13;
45.    Interest During Construction (IDC): The Borrower's Planning Commission would examine&#13;
and make modifications in the necessary procedures to ensure that IDC is capitalized and not deducted&#13;
during implementation; but is calculated at completion of Investment Projects and included in the final&#13;
project cost.&#13;
&#13;

responsibility for the Project Account(s). WAPDA would staff the NDP FMIS Unit with professionally&#13;
qualified accountants (i.e. Chartered Accountants), management specialists, and information systems&#13;
professionals.&#13;
47.    Financial Management and Information Systems (FMIS) Consultants: The General Manager&#13;
(Finance) of WAPDA would engage a firm of Chartered Accountants/Manageiment Consultants to assist&#13;

provide technical assistance to PAs in the preparation of their Financial Statements, verify and consolidate&#13;
them as part of their implementation assistance role on behalf of the Borrower, Provinces, and IDA. The&#13;
NDP FMIS Unit would prepare, maintain, and update "Consolidated Project Costs, Financing Plan, and&#13;
Accounts" for the entire project monthly, quarterly, annually, and cumulatively.&#13;
50.    Audit Arrangements: The Borrower, Provinces, and WAPDA would appoint a firm(s) of&#13;
Chartered Accountants to audit the Financial Statements for the project. PAs which fail to submit their&#13;
audited accounts within six months to the NDP FMIS Unit in WAPDA wouldL not be eligible for funds&#13;
from all project sources (i.e. Bank, the Borrower, Provinces, and other donors).&#13;
51.    Project Information Systems: The NDP FMIS Unit would develop a unified: (i) "Project&#13;
Financial Accounting and Management System"; (ii) "Project Information System (NDPIS)" which would&#13;
link the financial information system to all the project's activities and organization; and (iii) "Water Sector&#13;
Information System (WSIS)" linking the NDPIS to the socioeconomic, environrnental, infrastructural, and&#13;
hydrologic database of the project and the rest of the IBIS.&#13;
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE&#13;
52.    Project Policy: The Borrower, WAPDA, and Provinces would subscribe to the project's policy&#13;
and standards in favor of a high degree of public participation and disclosure of project information to the&#13;
public and the stakeholders in particular, inter alia, by endorsing a suitably worded generic statement&#13;
prepared by the NDP Coordination Cell to that effect. They would hold at Least one consultative and&#13;
informative public meeting in March before the formulation of the year's work program and budget; and&#13;
during the middle of the fiscal year to brief the stakeholders about the PA's progress in implementing the&#13;
year's work program and budget. The Participation Agreements with PAs would reflect the information&#13;
disclosure policy of the project i.e., a general presumption would exist in favor of public disclosure and&#13;
widespread dissemination of all of the project's formal/official reports, through publication of summary&#13;
leaflets and paid advertisements in local newspapers with translations in the local languages.&#13;
53.    Release of Documents of Public Interest: The Borrower, Provinces, and WAPDA would&#13;
translate the Drainage Sector Environmental Assessment (DSEA) and other project related documents of&#13;
public interest into local languages; summarize these documents and release them to the public before the&#13;
Mid-term Review through the media and Public Information Center and Library to be established by&#13;
WAPDA under the project. WAPDA would translate all "Three Year Rolling Business Plans" for PAs, all&#13;
RAPs, EIAs, and Investment Project Feasibility Study Reports into the local languages and disseminate&#13;

them widely to stakeholders, including through the local press in English and Urdu. WAPDA would&#13;
arrange for the full ElAs and RAPs to be available in the local language on demand from affected&#13;
populations and NGOs.&#13;
54.    Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements: WAPDA would publish the Annual Report&#13;
and Audited Financial Statements, the Annual Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Report, and the&#13;
Environmental and Resettlement Report of the project as a whole, or substantive excerpts thereof, in the&#13;
local press; and hold at least one public hearing meeting with stakeholders (including farmers, staff and&#13;
contractors) in its Headquarters and Regional Offices to discuss the Annual Report and Audited Financial&#13;
Statements. Each PA would publish its Annual Reports in the local press, and hold at least one public&#13;
briefing meeting with its stakeholders to discuss its Annual Reports and Audited Financial Statements.&#13;
55.    Quarterly Bulletin/Newsletter:  The NDP Cells would publish and distribute nationally a&#13;
quarterly bulletin or newsletter to educate and inform the public and project-affected persons about the&#13;
project's objectives, activities, policies, programs, and achievements. The magazine or bulletin would&#13;
recognize and highlight significant achievements of individuals, PAs and other agencies in support of the&#13;
project's objectives.&#13;
56.    Radio and Television Programs: The GOP's MW&amp;P, WAPDA and Provinces would sponsor or&#13;

maintain a Public Information Center and Library (PICL) in Lahore, Regional Offices and other publicly&#13;
accessible offices of WAPDA, PIDAs, and AWBs, which would be used as collection, storage, and&#13;
dissemination centers for public information regarding the project, water resources development issues in&#13;
Pakistan in general, and participatory irrigation and drainage management (PIM). All PICLs would be&#13;
accessible/open to the public, particularly the academic community, PAs, NGOs, students, and the press.&#13;
The PICLs would contain up-to-date copies of project information, which would be prominently displayed&#13;
with the intention of attracting the interest of the reading public.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.     Introduction: The framework for   economic analysis links the project's interventions&#13;
(institutional reforms, institutional, research and sector planning, and drainage investments) to anticipated&#13;
impacts and benefits. The analysis establishes linkages between the project and country and sector&#13;
strategies and includes quantitative and qualitative analyses of fiscal impacts, portfolio management,&#13;
poverty, environmental impacts, institutional analysis, and Investment Projects.&#13;
A.     SECTOR ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ROLE&#13;
2.     Sectoral Analysis/Reviews: Research and IDA experience suggests that next to sound economic&#13;
policy framework, the basis for sound investment decisions and implementation performance is a sound&#13;
sectoral analysis, particularly public expenditure reviews (PERs). The project is based on a number of&#13;
sectoral analyses, three of which are most important: (i) the Borrower's Water Sector Investment Planning&#13;
Study (WSIPS, 1993); (ii) the Borrower's Drainage Sector Environmental Assessment (DSEA, 1993); and&#13;
(iii) the Bank's Irrigation and Drainage Issues and Options paper (1994).&#13;
3.     Public Expenditure Reviews: IDA, jointly with ADB and OECF has conducted an Annual&#13;
Review of the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) since 1992. IDA has conducted an Annual&#13;
Country Poryfolio Performance Review (CPPR) with the Borrower, WAPDA, and Provinces since 1992.&#13;
The water sector has featured prominently in the annual reviews of the PSDP and CPPRs. The Feasibility&#13;
Study for the project included a detailed review of the Public Expenditure Program for Drainage. The&#13;
results of the Bank's study of "Fiscal Decentralization in Pakistan" were incorporated in the design of the&#13;
project during Appraisal. By recalculating the ERRs of projects which were originally contained in the&#13;
PSDPs of the Borrower and Provinces, the NDP Feasibility Study Consultants were able to recommend a&#13;
different mix of projects in the PSDPs, saving the Government millions of dollars from the combined&#13;
PSDP of the Borrower and Provinces. It is expected that the project will provide the basis, mechanism, and&#13;
resources around which the continuous evaluation of the PSDP for irrigation and drainage would be&#13;
evaluated annually, and high priority public sector investments financed.&#13;
4.     Private Sector Counterfactual: The public expenditure programs which would be financed&#13;
under the project have been identified after several rigorous reviews of the aspects of drainage and&#13;
irrigation capital and recurrent expenditures which the private sector can or should provide. The reviews&#13;
and sector analysis cited above concluded that the private sector should be responsible for substantial&#13;
investment costs, and almost all recurrent costs of on-farm drainage, lining of watercourses in SGW areas,&#13;
FGW tubewells, and tertiary drainage (subdrains). Off-farm drainage, however, is largely a public good&#13;
and regarded to be within the public sector domain, because the costs of inadequate drainage, costs of&#13;
providing remedy in the form of drainage relief, and benefits of drainage are borne largely by the public&#13;
(though mostly the farming community) at large. The cost recovery and sharing proposals also take into&#13;
account incidence of public investment and private or public gains. The project is designed to make the&#13;
transition to the public-private roles described above.&#13;
5.     The Policy Environment: Economic theory indicates that rates of return to investments such as&#13;
the project would be higher if they are implemented in a policy environment which has fewer distortions.&#13;
Pakistan has implemented many policy reforms in the past decade which have helped to improve the policy&#13;
environment for successful implementation of irrigation and drainage projects.&#13;
6.     Water Rights: Water rights exist in Pakistan on an informal basis. There is a growing concern in&#13;
Pakistan about increased and inefficient allocation and use of water resources. Attention is therefore being&#13;
focused on the use of water rights in water allocation. Water rights (through price signals) could better&#13;
allocate water and provide incentives for more efficient water use in agriculture, industry, and urban areas.&#13;
Tradable water-use rights that are separate from land may be established. Past use of water could be a&#13;
basis for allocation. Once established, water rights can be officially registered. Since a major objective of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97                                        ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
NDP is to reduce the drainable surplus inter alia through improving efficiency in water use and improving&#13;
canal delivery systems, a study of water rights would be inplemented under the project.&#13;
7.     Experience of countries such as Chile that have encouraged and practiced water markets in water&#13;
management has important implications for countries facing water scarcity and are considering introducing&#13;
water markets: there are significant gains from trade which can realized by fostering water markets;&#13;
transferable water-use rights or water rights, separate from land, are essential for water markets (these&#13;
rights can be stipulated by volume or by percentage of river or canal flow); great care should be exercised&#13;
in the initial allocation of water-use rights among users in order to make sure that most of the rights are not&#13;
captured by a few individuals; technology, such as adjustable gates, and institutional arrangements that&#13;
encourage the formation of active water users' associations can substantially redluce transaction costs and&#13;
facilitate market trading; the presence of privately held water rights does not necessarily make it more&#13;
difficult to reach environmental water quality objectives (water quality regulations need to be established&#13;
and enforced irrespective of the water allocation system); within a decentralized system of water resource&#13;
management, there is a continuing role for water management authorities in enforcing water rights and&#13;
resolving conflicts; and where irrigation systems have been built with public funds, there is an important&#13;
question concerning how much, if any, of the economic surplus generated by water trades should&#13;
governments try to capture. For a country like Pakistan with long rivers and extensive return flows, the&#13;
issue of water rights for users of return flows would have to be addressed in their water code.&#13;
B. EXPECTED BENEFITS&#13;
8.     Introduction: The project is an integral part of Pakistan's National Drainage Program (NDP),&#13;
which is anchored within the country's medium-term public expenditure plan. It focuses on the core&#13;
priority drainage investments. Its principal short term benefits will come from improvements in the&#13;
physical drainage and more effective operating drainage, which would leadl to increased output of&#13;
agricultural produce. It would also have a direct and positive impact on drained farm lands, regardless of&#13;
the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers cultivating these lands. It is estimated that farmers benefiting&#13;
from the drainage improvements can expect an increase in their net farm income of up to 30 percent,&#13;
depending on the local drainage and the agro-ecological conditions.&#13;
9.     The principal medium- and long-term  benefits will be improved drainage  and irrigation-&#13;
related policies, improved efficiency of public expenditures on drainage O&amp;M, iimproved capability in the&#13;
public sector to plan and implement water sector projects and in the private sector to undertake drainage-&#13;
related investments, all of which will benefit the environment and the agricultural sector as a whole. These&#13;
benefits will potentially be far greater than those from the physical drainage investments.&#13;
Fiscal Impacts&#13;
10.    The project's fiscal impacts will be reflected in the capital and recurTent budgets at both the&#13;
Federal and Provincial levels. The project is also expected to have an impact on investment portfolio&#13;
management. These impacts are discussed below.&#13;
II.    Development Budget Impacts: Analysis was conducted to address the issue of fiscal impact of&#13;
the project, in part because concern has been expressed regarding the project's size. Given the fungibility&#13;
of money, IDA could in effect be financing, at the margin, a different project than the one appraised.&#13;
Accordingly, it was also important to be satisfied that the sectoral and overall investment program was&#13;
appropriate. The fiscal analysis draws on results of recent public expenditure reviews.&#13;
12.    The Borrower's efforts to reduce its fiscal deficit has resulted in a progressively tightening&#13;
squeeze on the PSDP. At the same time, improving disbursement performance and higher lending by some&#13;
of the major donors imply rising budgetary requirements to provide for the needs of foreign assistance&#13;
program. There is an emerging inconsistency between the tightening budget and the growing foreign&#13;
assistance program. Adverse effects of this inconsistency are likely to be maniiested in under-budgeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                                       ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
the requirements of donor assisted projects and programs; and a tendency for the foreign aided component&#13;
of the PSDP to exceed the budget target (since some disbursements are independent of counterpart funds or&#13;
budget restrictions), weakening fiscal programming.&#13;
13.    Macroeconomic Impact (Relation to the Economy): An assessment of the macroeconomic&#13;
sustainability of the proposed project was done by comparing key macroeconomic indicators on a set of&#13;
macroeconomic projections with and without NDP, using data on GDP, PSDP, investment costs, and the&#13;
financing plan for the project. A somewhat slower pace of macroeconomic and structural reforms (but no&#13;
backtracking) as assumed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Pakistan, is used as the&#13;
macroeconomic framework for the NDP. Thus, the GDP growth, inflation rate, exchange rate of the rupee&#13;
to major currencies, and level of PSDP are determined by the "muddle through" scenario in the CAS. The&#13;
illustrative analysis is presented in Table IA (given at the end of this Annex)'. The share of the drainage&#13;
sector investment, including NDP, in the PSDP would remain close to historical levels, because many of&#13;
the projects to be funded under NDP are ongoing projects that are already in the PSDP and the&#13;
beneficiaries also share in investment costs. Planned public investment (with NDP) in the sector as a share&#13;
of projected GDP also remains very close to historical trends.&#13;
14.    The 1995/96 PSDP review found that allocations for a large number of high priority donor&#13;
assisted projects fell short of their funding requirements (both in terms of projected foreign aid and local&#13;
counterpart funding). Measures are being taken to alleviate the problem. The Borrower has agreed to&#13;
continue to formulate a core development program and a three-year rolling investment plan in consultation&#13;
with IDA and other donors; protect the allocations of the core projects/programs from possible cuts&#13;
necessitated by fiscal considerations; continue to review the pace of implementation during the year of the&#13;
projects for which the PSDP allocations of counterpart funds fall short of requirements and, if needed,&#13;
provide additional funds from the savings of slow moving projects; and regularly review the project&#13;
portfolio in consultation with IDA and other donors, and close or restructure under-perforrning and/or low&#13;
priority projects.&#13;
15.    The proposed project is consistent with the PSDP framework agreed between the Borrower and&#13;
IDA. Both parties agree that there is a need to increase investment in drainage to deal with accelerating&#13;
waterlogging and salinity. IDA has agreed with GOP on the size and composition of a three-year rolling&#13;
PSDP for the water sector for 1996-97 to 1998-99. Drainage is accorded high priority in the current rolling&#13;
program in which NDP is included. Under the project, IDA will agree with the Borrower (Planning&#13;
Commission) on the size and composition of the rolling prograrn for the project by April of each year.&#13;
16.    Counterpart Funding Requirements: The project's requirement of counterpart funds is within&#13;
the bounds of the Government's capacity for financing and implementation. Its Annual Development Plan&#13;
(ADP) counterpart requirements will be highest (at Rs. 2171 million or about US$42.5 million) in the fifth&#13;
year of implementation (FYO1/02)2. Participation by beneficiaries in capital investment costs of the project&#13;
would also reduce pressure on government counterpart funding. For example, for tile, surface and&#13;
subsurface drainage investments, and improvement of watercourses and irrigation systems, the private&#13;
sector would contribute about $31.1 million through labor and land.&#13;
17.    Recurrent Budget Impacts: The project's expected impact on the recurrent budgets of the&#13;
Provinces is presented in Table IB (given at the end of this Annex). The table represents the "base case"&#13;
The illustrative analysis was done using macroeconomic projections given in the latest CAS document. It is&#13;
expected that the results of the analysis would not change with updates of macroeconomic projections and NDP&#13;
financing plan.&#13;
2      The ADP counterpart funding requirement for each year are: FY97/98: Rs. 245 million (US$5.6 million);&#13;
FY98/99: Rs. 924 million (US$20.4 million); FY99/00: Rs. 1637 million (US$34.7 million); FY00/Ol: Rs. 2121&#13;
million (US$43.1 million); FY01/02: Rs. 2171 million (US$42.5 million); FY02/03: Rs. 2120 million (US$39.8&#13;
million); and FY03/04: Rs. 1719 million (US$31.2 million); and FY04/05: Rs. 606 million (US$10.7 million).&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 18&#13;
scenario which assumes that the institutional reform program is implemented according to plan. The&#13;
project's most significant direct benefit to the Provinces is expected to be in the iform of fiscal savings. The&#13;
savings would come from transfer of responsibility for O&amp;M from Provincial Governments to farmers.&#13;
Annual savings to Provinces is estimated at Rs. 2,519 million ($62 million), representing about 16% of&#13;
O&amp;M budget, by the year of completion. These savings are based on the following conservative estimates&#13;
and assumptions: (i) transition of 1,500 FGW Tubewells from the public sector to farmers' groups and&#13;
FOs would save the Provinces between Rs. 616 million per year in operating expenses; (ii) transfer of&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of on-farm surface drains of less than 15 cusecs to FOs would save the Provinces&#13;
Rs. 14 million per year in operating expenses and salaries of beldars (daily rated temporary workers); (iii)&#13;
replacing public sector SGW Tubewells with private sector (farner-managed) tile drains would save the&#13;
Provinces Rs. 124 million per year; and (iv) transfer of responsibility from Provinces to FOs for O&amp;M of&#13;
irrigation and drainage operations at the minor/distributary level could potentially save the Provinces Rs.&#13;
1765 million per year3. The above estimates are in addition to projected savings of Rs. 883 million in&#13;
annual subsidies by the Province of Punjab under the parallel Punjab Private Sector Groundwater&#13;
Development Project, in which 4,233 SCARP tubewells would be transitioned. In addition, other savings&#13;
(not quantified) would include reduced maintenance costs for housing, roads and other social&#13;
infrastructure, and public health. Efficiency gains from the improved efficiency, autonomy and hard&#13;
budget constraint of PIDAs and AWBs (which are both expected to achieve full financial self-sustainability&#13;
of O&amp;M costs in 10 years) would provide additional fiscal savings.&#13;
18.    Revenue Impacts: Another source of fiscal benefits from the project is tax revenue. The tax&#13;
revenue potential from the project is based on the expected benefiting cropped area, and assumes no&#13;
change in the existing composite tax structure for major crops. The applicable tax rates from the Left Bank&#13;
Outfall Drain (LBOD) Command, for which data is most readily available from a recent study4, are used as&#13;
the basis for the illustrative analysis. Not counting Abiana, the most recent combined rates for Land&#13;
Revenue, Ushr Rates (Productivity Tax), and Local Fund (County Tax) per acre in the LBOD Command&#13;
are Rs. 132 for wheat, Rs. 140 for cotton, Rs. 87 for rice, Rs. 227 for sugarcane, Rs. 137 for oilseeds, and&#13;
Rs. 90 for vegetables5. The area affected by the project would depend on the intervention assumed. The&#13;
area which is likely to benefit from the project's interventions could be as high as 13.5 million acres. If this&#13;
estimate is realized, the potential ( not projected) yield from tax revenues to Provinces would vary from a&#13;
low of Rs. 1200 million (assuming combined rates of Rs. 87 per acre) to as much as Rs. 3000 million&#13;
(assuming combined rates of Rs. 227 per acre).&#13;
19.    The above analysis assumes that everything goes according to plan. However, in the course of&#13;
implementation it is likely that the project would encounter problems in some of its fiscally important&#13;
components. For example, the progress in transferring O&amp;M responsibility from Provincial Governments&#13;
to farmers may be slower than anticipated and tax revenues from benefiting cropped areas may be smaller.&#13;
This would constitute a "low case" scenario under which the fiscal savings and tax revenues would be less&#13;
than anticipated.&#13;
20.     Balance of Payments: The project's direct benefit to the Borrower and the economy at large is&#13;
likely to be felt in its impact on the country's balance of payments (BOP) position in ternns of foreign&#13;
exchange saved or earned. To the extent that the projected incremental net earnings from Investment&#13;
3       This estimate is based on the following conservative assumptions: (a) the jurisdictions which will be&#13;
transferred to FOs from Provinces are roughly coincident with the Subdivisional Officer (SDO) or Junior EXEN level&#13;
of operations under the existing system; and (b) the amount of savings assumes that approximately one FO will be&#13;
established in each of the 43 AWBs per annum for five years; for a total of about 200 FOs by year 5 of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

Projects6 strengthen the country's BOP position, they would contribute to the Borrower's capacity to&#13;
service the debt associated with the project.&#13;
21.     Financial Returns to the Borrower and its Provinces: Based on the above analysis of Fiscal&#13;
Savings and Tax Revenues, the IRR to the Borrower and Provinces (considering the Borrower's and&#13;
Provinces' investments in the project, and the financial returns in the form of fiscal savings and tax&#13;
revenues) is estimated at about 11.4% (nominal terms). This reflects, in large part, the impact of subsidies&#13;
for capital works. The payback to the Borrower and its Provinces from the project is about 5.5 years after&#13;
project completion.&#13;
22.     Portfolio Management: Drainage projects in Pakistan have typically been inadequately prepared,&#13;
programmed, implemented, and not well integrated with Five Year or the Annual Development Programs&#13;
(ADP). Moreover, the selection of projects has not always been rational or transparent. Allocation of&#13;
development funds is on the basis of fixed provincial shares and not according to drainage needs. The&#13;
result is that the portfolio of drainage projects is characterized by implementation delays, too many&#13;
incomplete projects, inadequate financing (especially of counterpart funds), poor quality of construction,&#13;
low rates of return at entry, and cost overruns. The Feasibility Study for the project showed that the&#13;
"throwforward," a term used by the Planning Commission to describe the value of projects which are&#13;
carried from one Five Year or Annual Development Plan into the next, from the Seventh Five Year Plan&#13;
(1989-93) into the Eighth Five Year Plan (1993-98) rose to a record of Rs. 54.7 billion. Current estimate&#13;
of the "throwforward" into the Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003) indicate that without considering any&#13;
new investments, it would be Rs. 15.7 billion. However, considering new projects and the project's&#13;
financing for the last three years of the Eighth Plan, the Feasibility Study estimated that the&#13;
"throwforward" would be reduced to only Rs. 5.2 billion, mainly due to availability of funding as a result&#13;
of NDP.&#13;
23.     Successful implementation of the project should result in a substantial increase in public&#13;
investment and aid flows into major irrigation and drainage infrastructure during the Ninth Five Year Plan&#13;
period, notably for the proposed National Surface Drainage System (NSDS). This increase in public&#13;
investment is critical for the future viability of irrigated agriculture in the Indus Basin Irrigation System. It&#13;
would reduce the size of "throwforward", enable timely completion of projects due to increased availability&#13;
of funds, and improve project quality due to better project preparation made possible by adoption of more&#13;
stringent selection criteria set up in the context of the project. Moreover, the project and future projects&#13;
such as NSDS would link the portfolio of drainage projects to a coherent long-term strategy for disposal of&#13;
effluent outside the basin.&#13;
Economic Efficiency Impacts&#13;
24.     Potential Efficiency Gains: The various interventions supported by the project are expected to&#13;
lead to efficiency gains. Drainage research and sector planning would lead to efficiency gains by&#13;
enhancing the technical foundations of drainage, and facilitating long-term sector and project planning.&#13;
Institutional reforms would bring about efficiency gains by strengthening the capacity and improving the&#13;
efficiency of key drainage institutions, and ensuring that the project design is within the implementation&#13;
capacity of existing institutions. Reforms in WAPDA (Water Wing), establishment of PIDAs, AWBs, and&#13;
FOs should enhance the effectiveness of their service delivery. Investments under the project would&#13;
generate efficiency gains in water delivery and drainage. Abiana collection would be expected to improve&#13;
under the proposed assessment and collection system.&#13;
6       The illustrative analysis of incremental net economic earnings on six Investment Project districts in Sindh&#13;
Province for which detailed farm budget analysis was done may be to demonstrate of the BOP impact. The analysis&#13;
indicates that incremental net earnings would turn positive from year 2001 at about Rs. 2.6 billion ($65 million), and&#13;
increase gradually thereafter (assuming no switching in cropping patterns and no market limits).&#13;

Employment Impacts&#13;
25.    Direct Impacts: The project is expected to generate many direct emrployment benefits to the&#13;
economy. Effective implementation of the Project Coordination and Supervision Component would&#13;
provide opportunities for redeployment of surplus staff in MW&amp;P, WAPDA's W7ater Wing, PIDs (in their&#13;
new form as PIDAs, AWBs and FOs), and PAD-OFWMs to gainful employment in the implementation of&#13;
a sector-wide project, the first of its kind and scope since the IBRWP. Without the project, many of these&#13;
staff would be effectively redundant (i.e. technically unemployed) in their present employment.&#13;
Considering the direct financial costs, and indirect efficiency costs to the institutions and the economy of&#13;
carrying these redundant staff, the economic benefits accruing from their gainful employment under the&#13;
project are substantial, though no attempt has been made to quantify them. Of course, many of these&#13;
employees would again become redundant when the implementation of the project is completed, unless the&#13;
levels of investment and employment are maintained through follow-up projects. To protect against the risk&#13;
of over-manning which is associated with the project's direct incremental staff requirements, WAPDA's&#13;
Water Wing, PIDAs, AWBs and FOs will not employ additional staff on account of the project or any&#13;
other project for the duration of the project, without the prior agreement of the Borrower or the Provinces,&#13;
as the case may be, and only on the basis of sound financing plans.&#13;
26.    When fully implemented i.e. after project completion, the Institutional Reforms Component could&#13;
likely result in a net reduction of the number of employees in WAPDA and PIDs. The phased withdrawal&#13;
of WAPDA's Water Wing from construction of on-farm drainage such as surface drains, tile drains and&#13;
SGW tubewells, would provide an opportunity or the needed flexibility for WAPDA to reduce its low-&#13;
skilled casual (i.e. daily rated) workers in the Regional Offices. Reorganization, automation, process&#13;
improvement, and mechanization of some of WAPDA's functions which are currently over-manned or&#13;
managed using outdated methods (specifically accounting, monitoring, planning and investigation) could&#13;
result in substantial reduction of surplus staff and costs. On the other hand, expansion of the Water Wing's&#13;
other functions (e.g. O&amp;M of inter-Provincial drainage; vigorous pursuit of the construction of inter-&#13;
Provincial drainage, establishment of a vibrant WSIS, establishment of the Social Cell and other capacity&#13;
building initiatives, and active management of the IBIS water resources) should[ compensate for much of&#13;
the expected redundancies from the retrenchments alluded above. Some of the staff can be redeployed to&#13;
the new functions. PIDAs, AWBs and FOs may eventually be compelled by new financial self-sufficiency&#13;
requirements to mechanize many of the functions which are carried out by beldars and chaukidars. The use&#13;
of private contractors for O&amp;M (e.g. through O&amp;M Performance Contracts) would also likely result in&#13;
reduction of disguised unemployment. The most significant redundancy effects though are expected to&#13;
occur with the turnover of distributaries and minors to FOs i.e. at the EXEN level; because it is at this level&#13;
that PIDs employ the majority of their low-skilled staff (notably, clerks, beldars and chaukidars); many of&#13;
whom would no longer be required if farmers take over their functions.&#13;
27.    The most significant employment impacts of the project are expected to arise from the Investment&#13;
Component, after completion. Short term direct employment impacts would accrue from construction&#13;
activities. After completion, the investment component would reclaim or preserve abandoned agricultural&#13;
farmlands, and rehabilitate existing land, which would otherwise ultimately go out of production due to&#13;
waterlogging and salinity. Based on the average land holding by Province, the estimated benefit is&#13;
employment for about 16,660 farmers; in addition to reducing disguised unemployment for thousands&#13;
more farmers whose lands are currently marginally productive, and would be restored through the project's&#13;
investment activities.&#13;
Poverty Impacts&#13;
28.    Positive Poverty Impacts: Areas which are affected by high levels of waterlogging and salinity&#13;
tend to have the lowest incomes, high unemployment, and lawlessness in Pakistan. Hence these problems&#13;
have a poverty and equity dimension too. They affect the rural poor (especially those at tail-ends of&#13;
watercourses and minors) and landless tenants most severely. The project would sassist in poverty reduction&#13;
by increasing agricultural output (food and cash crops). Since agriculture is among the most effective tools&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                                         ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 7 of 18&#13;
for poverty alleviation, by helping to raise agricultural output, farm incomes, and providing additional&#13;
employment opportunities in those areas, the project will help alleviate rural poverty and improve the&#13;
socio-economic prerequisites for law and order. The selection criteria for Investment Projects are designed&#13;
to skew the benefits in favor of tenant farmers, smallholders, and tail-enders. Specifically, Investment&#13;
Projects would, to the extent possible, be designed to benefit small farmers, women, and poorest one-third&#13;
of the income strata of the members of the farming community. This would be demonstrated through a&#13;
Social Assessment for the Investment Project. The institutional reforms, particularly the formation of FOs,&#13;
are expected to increase the transparency and equity of water allocation and use. The poor would also&#13;
benefit from flood protection provided by the project.&#13;
29.     The project is designed to facilitate reduction and evacuation of the drainable surplus so as to&#13;
increase agricultural production that is broadly based and provide appropriate spillover effects on non-farm&#13;
growth through backward and forward linkages. Thus, the project would address the multifaceted problem&#13;
of poverty alleviation by increasing employment opportunities in the non-farm sector and increasing&#13;
productivity of marginal farmers and landless tenants. For every I percent increase in per capita farm&#13;
growth, it is estimated that the project would provide a 1.5 percent increase in per capita non-farm growth&#13;
in the year 200 1'.&#13;
30.    Income Distribution Impacts:  While the project's water management investmnents would&#13;
improve water resource allocation efficiencies between owners of land at the head and tail of canals, it is&#13;
likely that agricultural production benefits would still be skewed towards large land owners. However,&#13;
benefits to large land owners would likely encourage domestic resource mobilization in rural areas, which&#13;
would lead to benefits to the poor in terms of additional farm and non-farm employment opportunities.&#13;
There is a reasonable probability that the drainage investments would benefit the rural elite and landlords&#13;
to a greater extent than the rural poor, thus exacerbating rural income inequality. To address this risk,&#13;
Investment Project selection criteria would favor areas and beneficiaries who are in the bottom one-third&#13;
income strata of the farming community. In addition, the requirement that beneficiaries contribute to the&#13;
cost of installing drains in their areas through labor would likely select-out the rural elite. However, the&#13;
rural elite may simply hire day laborers to do the job. The project's actual and potential impacts on rural&#13;
income, poverty, and income distribution would be monitored closely during the first phase of&#13;
implementation, and necessary adjustments would be made, based on the results of the MTR.&#13;
Environmental Impacts&#13;
31.    The project's adverse environmental impacts are expected to result from disposal of subsurface&#13;
drainage effluent, leaching of salts from agricultural lands, habitat changes in waterlogged and saline lands,&#13;
and resettlement. However, these adverse impacts are expected to be very narrowly focused and would be&#13;
completely offset by broad-based positive impacts. The positive effects of the environment would include&#13;
improvements on waterlogged lands, soil salinity, groundwater quality, flood protection, and afforestation.&#13;
The project's expected social and environmental impacts are summarized in the Table below.&#13;
7       John Mellor (1976) finds a I percent increase in per capita agricultural growth in 1.5 percent increase in per&#13;
capita non-agricultural growth; other estimates are provided by Cheong (1988) and others suggesting 2 percent&#13;
increase in per capita non-farrn production growth from a I percent in per capita farm production growth.&#13;

32.    The Research Subcomponent: The research subcomponent is designed to improve effectiveness&#13;
of irrigation and drainage systems in the country. The research programs will test: various new technologies&#13;
under Pakistani conditions. The principal benefits expected from the identified drainage research program&#13;
are expected to be the following: (i) improved technologies and reduced costs of investment and O&amp;M of&#13;
drainage, arising from design and maintenance procedures for surface drains; (ii) improved hydraulic&#13;
designs for surface drains; (iii) reduced cost and improved efficacy of collaborative (community) tile&#13;
drainage; (iv) recommendations for institutional frameworks to improve sustainability and productivity of&#13;
irrigated agriculture in Pakistan; (v) designs and recommendations for resource rnonitoring using GIS on a&#13;
sectoral approach; (vi) breakthroughs in reuse and disposal of drainage water, which would substantially&#13;
reduce the drainable surplus and increase the supply of irrigation supplies available; (vii) information for&#13;
planning and policy regarding the impact of tile drainage on land and water management; and (viii) designs&#13;

34.    Historical benefits from drainage research by IWASRI (one of the PRIs) in Pakistan illustrate the&#13;
up-side potential benefits which can be expected from the proposed drainage research subcomponent. The&#13;
benefits of improved drainage design can be gleaned from the Fourth Drainage Project. During the design&#13;
and construction of the Fourth Drainage Project, important reductions in cost, compared with first designs,&#13;
were realized as a result of integrating the findings of concurrent research which was undertaken on one of&#13;
the project sites (sump). The length of subsurface drains was reduced from 1,600 miles to 500 miles, and&#13;
the number of sumps from 250 to 79; with a reduction in project nominal costs from Rs. 700 million to Rs.&#13;
300 million despite the effects of inflation associated with an implementation period of 11 years.&#13;
Application of groundwater models to drainage design enabled the identification of spatially varying&#13;
drainage needs, which led to the abandonment of the uniform spacing of subsurface drains that had&#13;
previously been planned/assumed for the design of the component.&#13;
35.    The benefits of research on design criteria for drainage can be inferred from the recent work of&#13;
IWASRI; which shows that the drainage coefficient for tile drainage projects which were designed before&#13;
1990 was overly conservative; and has therefore been reduced in more recent projects. The reduction in&#13;
the drainage coefficient has not only greatly reduced the capital cost of drainage projects, but also the&#13;
recurrent costs and the quantity of drainage effluent for disposal, thereby reducing the adverse&#13;
environmental impact associated with disposal requirements of drainage effluent on the downstream users,&#13;
and other effects of tile drainage. As a result of these research findings, the drainage coefficient has been&#13;
reduced from 2.7 mm/d under Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (in 1990), to 1.8 mm/d in planning for Khushab&#13;
SCARP; and the drainage coefficient for Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia has recently been reduced to 1.5 mm/d&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105                                        ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 10 of 18&#13;
following the discussions which emanated from IWASRI's research. This shows that designers of drainage&#13;
projects in Pakistan have now gained confidence that a design with a lower drainage coefficient can&#13;
concurrently meet the objectives of watertable control, reducing project caipital and recurrent costs&#13;
substantially. The proposed subcomponent on drainage research under the project will support further&#13;
research to better determine the drainage coefficient.&#13;
36.    The benefits of Pakistan's recent research on interceptor drains are equally significant. Seepage&#13;
from canals is one of the major contributors to waterlogging. Interceptor drains to recover this seepage&#13;
have been constructed at a few sites in Pakistan; and were planned for Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South)&#13;
Project, and under LBOD. The estimated cost of interceptor drains in Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) is&#13;
Rs. 500 million; while the cost in LBOD is Rs. 768 million. Research fndings from IWASRI after these&#13;
projects had been approved indicated that interceptors should be used selectively, and not as a standard&#13;
technique for recovering seepage from canals, because the effectiveness of the interceptors was too low&#13;
(30%, which implied that to recover 0.5 cusec net, 2.7 cusec has to be pumped); and would lead to&#13;
excessive O&amp;M costs.&#13;
37.    Drainage research has also contributed to the reduction of costs for drain envelopes. In Pakistan,&#13;
gravel is traditionally used as drain envelope; whereas there is a worldwide trend to use synthetic materials.&#13;
IWASRI has started laboratory and field tests to establish applicability of synthetic materials as drain&#13;
envelope. Test lines have been laid in Fourth Drainage Project, and are scheduled for Fordwah Eastern&#13;
Sadiqia Project. Switching from gravel to synthetic envelopes has already resulted in capital cost savings&#13;
as high as 40% in the Fourth Drainage Project with the same level of drainage collection and efficiency.&#13;
38.    The Sector Planning Subcomponent: Empirical evidence shows that sound sector framework is&#13;
essential to achieving development impact of projects. Sector studies are essential tools for guiding policy&#13;
formulation and implementation. Such studies would include policy, strategy, planning and feasibility&#13;
studies. The expected benefits of the sector planning subcomponent are not easily quantifiable. However,&#13;
potential benefits which are expected from each of the main areas of intervention under the planning&#13;
subcomponent are summarized in the following paragraphs.&#13;
39.    Policy Studies: These are expected to result in an improved policy environment for public and&#13;
private investment in irrigation and drainage. A partial list of the potential benefits which are expected&#13;
from each of the main policy studies proposed or agreed to be carried out under the project are summarized&#13;
below. The National Water Policy would (i) enable investments in major inter-Provincial water resources&#13;
development programs such as reservoirs and trunk drains; (ii) codify the role of the Borrower in the water&#13;
sector; and (iii) allow official recognition of water as an economic good. The study of water markets and&#13;
water rights in AWBs and in selected FO pilot areas could eventually result in the: (i) establishment of a&#13;
National Register of Water Rights; (ii) legalization of water trading up to the AWB level, possibly between&#13;
AWBs; and (iii) greater willingness to price surface water at more realistic (market based) levels. The&#13;
study on gypsum marketing and distribution would be expected to result in a greater: (i) willingness of the&#13;
Borrower and Provinces to deregulate gypsum marketing, and to abolish the erratic subsidy on gypsum,&#13;
which appears to be a major deterrent to development of an effective private sector-led market in gypsum;&#13;
(ii) greater availability and use of gypsum for treatment of sodicity; and (iii) in the long run, increased&#13;
utilization of gypsum and the associated reduction in land areas lost to sodicity. The study on promoting&#13;
private investment in drainage would be expected to provide the basis for: (i) policies to encourage private&#13;
sector investment in drainage, particularly from communities in partnership with private contractors; (ii)&#13;
reduction in subsidies for drainage; (iii) more rapid drainage and reclamation of waterlogged and saline&#13;
lands, as private investment substitutes public investment; (iv) policies and programs which result in more&#13;
focused targeting of public investment in drainage to areas where the public good is clearly dominant, and&#13;
away from areas where private gains are substantial; and (v) improvements in capital and O&amp;M cost&#13;
recovery resulting from clearly defmed policies in that regard. The study on regulation of exploitation of&#13;
FGW is expected to recommend: (i) policies to regulate and promote optimal exploitation and permit&#13;
recharging of FGW aquifers; (ii) clearer delineation of the roles of Federal and Provincial agencies in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                                       ANNEX 9&#13;
Page II of 18&#13;
regulation of FGW exploitation; and (iii) reduction of salt-water intrusion in FGW aquifers arising from&#13;
unregulated over-exploitation of FGW aquifers.&#13;
40.    Planning Studies: The benefits which are expected from the agreed or identified planning studies&#13;
are as follows: (a) the Irrigation and Drainage Atlas of Pakistan is expected to result in substantial&#13;
improvement in (i) planning for irrigation and drainage; and (ii) utilization of water resources; (b) the&#13;
Long-Term Financing Options for Drainage study is expected to result in recommendations and policies&#13;
which would encourage private investment in drainage, as well as policies to facilitate public sector&#13;
financing for drainage e.g. developing capital markets for financing drainage; (c) the study of Revenue&#13;
Prospects for WAPDA 's Water Wing would lay the groundwork for policy and institutional reforms which&#13;
would enable the Water Wing to become financially self-sustaining in the long run, for example by selling&#13;
its services to the Power Wing; (d) the study of Revenue Options for PIDAs, A WBs, and FOs would enable&#13;
them to identify prospects and mechanisms for them to increase the buoyancy of their revenue sources,&#13;
from Abiana and from other sources; (e) the study of Efficacy of Past Drainage Investments by the&#13;
Planning Commission is expected to result in recommendations for changes in the Borrower's policies and&#13;
priorities for financing drainage, including PC- 1 guidelines for project preparation, selection, and&#13;
implementation; and (f) the Preparation of the Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003) is expected to facilitate&#13;
the preparation of a high quality contribution from the Water Wing of the Planning Commission into the&#13;
Ninth Five Year Plan.&#13;
41.    Feasibility Studies: The following are among the feasibility studies for future potential projects&#13;
which would be carried out under the project: (i) National Surface Drainage System (NSDS; (ii) LBOD&#13;
Stage II; (iii) Preparation of NDP 11; and (iv) Feasibility Studies for Hydraulic Modeling of Canal&#13;
Commands for A WBs and FOs. These feasibility studies would be in addition to the modular feasibility&#13;
studies and business plans for PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs that would be financed under the project as part of&#13;
the institutional reform program. The benefits which are expected from the agreed or identified feasibility&#13;
studies are: (i) a strong pipeline of better prepared high priority projects; (ii) consensus on implementing&#13;
major inter-Provincial drainage projects; and (iii) attraction of donor financing for drainage programs. Of&#13;
course, the real benefits of the pipeline of high priority national drainage projects whose feasibility studies&#13;
would be financed under the project would accrue when they are implemented and operated satisfactorily.&#13;
Expected Benefits from the Institutional Reforms Component&#13;
42.    Institutional Reforms in WAPDA's Water Wing: Expected benefits from institutional reforms&#13;
in WAPDA's Water Wing include improved performance of the institution, for example, coordinated&#13;
management and regulation of water resources at the basin level, including related land and water quality&#13;
issues and monitoring of environmental impacts.&#13;
43.    Institutional Reforms in PIDs: Substantial benefits are expected to come from  the&#13;
decentralization and management transfer of irrigation and drainage services from PIDs to PIDAs, AWBs,&#13;
and FOs. Since PIDAs, AWBs, and FOs will be independent revenue generating and spending agencies&#13;
(the latter owned by farmers themselves), they will have incentives to minimize their expenditures and&#13;
recover full costs from beneficiaries. This will reduce the fiscal dependence of the irrigation and drainage&#13;
system on Provinces for funding O&amp;M. This will work more effectively if it is accompanied by improved&#13;
access to water through the establishment and granting of tradable water rights, and a clear demarcation of&#13;
duties between the new irrigation and drainage agencies. These reforms will in effect introduce quasi-&#13;
market incentives into the management of the irrigation system. Significant benefits can be expected to&#13;
accrue from the legalization and/or establishment of water rights in FOs, which is among the policy&#13;
reforms that would be implemented under the project. Where farms are small (or for administrative&#13;
convenience), water rights could in some instances be allocated to FOs and WUAs. According to a recent&#13;
survey by WAPDA, active water markets (trading or purchasing of water) exist in 70 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

watercourses studied by WAPDA'. According to research, establishment of tradable water rights could&#13;
make important contributions in improving the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of water use9. Well-&#13;
defined tradable rights would formalize and secure the existing water rights held by users; economize on&#13;
transaction costs; and induce water users to consider the full opportunity costs of water. If well-defined&#13;
water rights are established in FOs, the entities and individual farmers can be expected to invest in water-&#13;
saving technologies knowing that they would benefit from the investment.&#13;
Expected Benefits from the Investment Component&#13;
44.     Introduction: Research evidence shows that rehabilitation projects have highly variable net&#13;
benefits, and that it is important to be selective in the choice of Investment Projects to be financed. Large-&#13;
scale, capital intensive rehabilitation which seeks to remake the entire system is prone to rent-seeking,&#13;
delays, and cost overruns that characterize construction of new systems. Therefore, investments in&#13;
improved irrigation and drainage facilities should ideally be closely linked to establishment of tradable&#13;
water rights. For the purpose of assessing the economic rate of return of the project, the direct&#13;
quantifiable benefits from rehabilitation and improvement of the public sector surface drains and&#13;
construction of on-farm drainage works would be considered. These interventions will improve drainage&#13;
conditions, resulting in higher crop yields and cropping intensity.&#13;
45.     Production Benefits:  The proposed project would have two important impacts. Drainage&#13;
installation would lower the groundwater table and reduce soil salinity, thereby leading to rapidly improved&#13;
yields and lower production cost. The project also addresses a long-term issue: vvithout the project, future&#13;
yields would progressively decline from their current levels. The project would have two additional&#13;
benefits: (a) the avoidance of further yield (production) losses, which would result if the groundwater and&#13;
salinity problems were to persist; and (b) the productivity increase resulting from reducing&#13;
waterlogging/salinity problems. The "without" project situation would lead to a substantial loss in&#13;
agricultural production and an environmental disaster and great suffering for farmers. The rising of the&#13;
deep saline watertable would reduce yields to almost zero once it reaches the crop root zone. Large areas&#13;
of crop land would completely go out of production in the "without" project scenario. Productivity&#13;
increase is the most imnportant of the two benefit subsets. The sum of the benefits represents the "with and&#13;
without" project situation, rather than the "before and after" situation. Insofar as improved drainage may&#13;
have positive effects on agricultural technologies or cultural practices, the benefits are understated.&#13;
46.     The project is expected to benefit many farmers directly, and the entire irrigated sector indirectly,&#13;
by reclaiming abandoned land, rehabilitating existing lands, and improving drainage in about 13.5 million&#13;
acres. Agricultural benefits would come from increased crop production and employment as a result of&#13;
reduction in watertable depth and soil salinity, and better operations and maintenance of irrigation system&#13;
through private sector involvement and improved performance of public institutions in the water sector as a&#13;
result of institutional strengthening. Cropped area, cropping intensity, and crop yields are expected to&#13;
increase as a result of the project. Cropping patterns are also expected to change due to reduced soil&#13;
salinity, waterlogging, and flooding. Crops that are less tolerant to salinity and waterlogging can be grown&#13;
in the "with project" situation. Production would increase over the "without project" situation due to both&#13;
(i) the direct effects of decreased saline intrusions and (ii) improved drainage. The annual incremental&#13;
production expected from the project's investment component is summarized below.&#13;
47.     New Investments and On-Farm  Drainage and O&amp;M:   Based on the currently available&#13;
information on the pipeline of on-going or new drainage projects which the project would finance, the&#13;

Hans Binswanger (World Bank), in Markets in Tradable Water Rights; World Development, Vol. 22, No. 11 pp. 1613-&#13;

project's new investment subcomponent would provide new or additional on- and off-farm drainage&#13;
facilities for: (i) on-going locally funded projects; (ii) transition of FGW tubewells; (iii) new surface drains;&#13;
(iv) intercepting drains; and (v) community tertiary and tile drains in the LBOD Command (Mirpurkhas),&#13;
D.G. Khan Integrated Irrigation and Drainage, Fourth Drainage, SCARP Mardan, and East Khairpur.&#13;
Additional benefits would accrue from new investments which have been identified but not prepared or&#13;
appraised, and some which have not yet been identified. The benefits of new investments are assumed to&#13;
mirror but be higher than those for rehabilitation and modernization (see para below), although the benefit-&#13;
cost ratio would be more favorable for rehabilitation and remodeling.&#13;
48.    Rehabilitation &amp;  Modernization of Off-Farm  Drainage: A number of surface drains are&#13;
proposed for rehabilitation and remodeling. Projections for agricultural production without surface drain&#13;
investments in the selected areas are that yields would gradually decrease and over a thirty year period be&#13;
reduced by 50 percent. Costs of production would gradually increase as planting and sowing, harvesting,&#13;
and fertilizer continue to grow as a percentage of production inputs. Surface drains are expected to reduce&#13;
the number of days the land is waterlogged and decrease salinity and thus reclaim cultivable command&#13;
area, improve planting and harvesting efficiency, and decrease costs of production including planting and&#13;
sowing, harvesting and fertilizer.&#13;
49.    Rehabilitation &amp;  Modernization of Water Management: The component is expected to&#13;
provide canal commands with improved telecommunications and equipment. Rehabilitation of the canal&#13;
commands is expected to improve water carrying capacity of drains and reduce crop losses from flooding.&#13;
It will also significantly increase water deliveries to tail-end farmers. Modernizing canal commands with&#13;
improved telecommunications and equipment would have a positive impact on the distribution of water&#13;
and provide for better water control. Improved distribution of water will affect agricultural production in&#13;
the entire cultivable command area and improve productivity.  The intervention would also increase&#13;
productivity and decrease maintenance costs of production for tail-end farmers, who will now receive a&#13;
steady and reliable source of water. Agricultural productivity is expected to start increasing from the year&#13;
after completion of construction works. It is estimated that productivity would improve by 2 percent for&#13;
the entire command area and by an additional 20 percent for tail-end farmers. Tail-end farmers would also&#13;
realize additional benefits from a 1.5 percent reduction in costs of production. Productivity and costs are&#13;
expected to remain steady in future years after the initial impact. It is estimated that rehabilitation would&#13;
increase productivity and cropping intensities by 2 percent as a result of reduced crop damage from&#13;
breaches in canals and flooding, and an additional 5 percent for tail-end farmers, who would observe a&#13;
significant increase in surface water deliveries.&#13;
50.    Lining Watercourses in Saline Groundwater Areas:  The primary objective of lining&#13;
watercourses is to increase agricultural production through effective use of irrigation water saved by&#13;
renovation of watercourses and application of improved on-farm water management practices. It is&#13;
expected, for example, that 750 watercourses would be lined in saline groundwater (SGW) areas around&#13;
Nara Canal Command and Khairpur East; the projections for agricultural production without lining&#13;
watercourses in saline areas of Nara and Khairpur in the Sanghar and Khairpur Districts are that yields&#13;
would remain constant and cost of production would increase gradually due to rising costs of planting,&#13;
harvesting, etc. It is estimated that lining watercourses would have a positive impact on the distribution of&#13;
water at the watercourse level and would affect agricultural production by 11 percent in Sanghar and&#13;
Khairpur. It is also anticipated that the intervention would provide for saving water conveyance losses by&#13;
5% and 10% in lined and unlined watercourses, respectively. Benefits on agricultural productivity are&#13;
expected to occur immediately the year after construction. Productivity and costs are expected to remain&#13;
steady in future years after the initial impact.&#13;
51.    Potential Production Losses: The investment component of the project is expected to lead to&#13;
some loss in agricultural production since some agricultural land will be acquired for project purposes.&#13;
The NDP Feasibility Study Consultants estimated that about 1.21 hectares of land will be acquired for each&#13;
kilometer of off-farm surface drains rehabilitated or built. On that basis, it is estimated that a total of 8,696&#13;
hectares of land are likely to be acquired. Current average net income in the project areas is estimated at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109                                            ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 14 of IS&#13;
Rs. 17,670 per hectare per year. Thus average annual losses from agricultural income from land acquired&#13;
for project purposes would be about Rs. 153.7 million. This loss would be more than offset by expected&#13;
benefits.&#13;
Estimation Of Economic Rates Of Return And Net Present Values&#13;
52.     The selection criteria requires that Investment Projects should have a minimum economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR), excluding non-quantifiable benefits, of 15 percent. The various types of Investment Projects&#13;
which would be supported under the project have had historically high ERRs (200/%-50%) in Pakistan'0.&#13;
Studies of completed projects in Pakistan also show that higher ERRs are achieved under program rather&#13;
than project approach for the same type of investments. Drainage projects in other countries also show&#13;
high rates of return". The economic analysis for the potential Investment Projects in the pipeline (given in&#13;
the Table below) indicate that substantial number of these projects, covering various types of interventions,&#13;
would meet the ERR selection criteria. The ERRs of the various types of Investrment Projects also span a&#13;
wide range. These reflect variations in cropping patterns and yield levels, the degree of surface flooding&#13;
and its frequency, the extent of waterlogging, and the available irrigation supplies.&#13;

            Pakistan - National Drainage Program (NDP) Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the National Drainage
            Program Project are to improve the efficiency of the
            irrigation and drainage system in Pakistan, and ensure its
            sustainability. The project is designed as a sector
            investment project, consisting of three complementary
            components: 1) a sector planning and research component
            facilitating long-term sector and project planning, namely,
            for the National Surface Drainage System (NSDS) to carry
            saline effluent from the drainage network to the sea, and
            enhancing the technical foundations of drainage; 2) the
            institutional reforms component, the most important
            component, aimed at decentralizing provincial irrigation
            departments, and streamlining and building the capacity of
            water and power development authorities, provincial
            irrigation and drainage authorities, area water boards,
            on-farm water management directorates of provincial
            agricultural departments, and farmers' organizations;
            and 3) the investment component, designed to improve
            drainage and water management infrastructure, and to protect
            inland wetlands, which finances completion of ongoing
            projects, rehabilitation and remodeling of completed
            drainage projects, and new projects which conform to or
            support the overall strategies of the project.
