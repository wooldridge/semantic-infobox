&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: . . I have been associated with the Bank from as early as 1968 when&#13;
I used to work for the Pakistan government, but I have forgotten many of these things, so&#13;
unless you ask me specific questions, I would not know what to tell you.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, let start with was this â&#128;&#153;68, then, and your working with the government.&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#153;s your recollection of the role of the Bank in time of the cleavage of Pakistan, the&#13;
origination of Bangladesh?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Well, in â&#128;&#153;68 I was a Deputy Secretary in the Economic Affairs&#13;
Division, Pakistan, in Islamabad. And later on, in â&#128;&#153;70, I worked as Joint Secretary in the&#13;
government of Pakistan, External Finance. And in both of these capacities I had to come&#13;
in contact with the Bank from time to time. In the external resources divisionâ&#128;&#148;they&#13;
called it E-A-D, Economic Affairs Division, E-A-Dâ&#128;&#148;I used to be responsible for&#13;
coordinating aid work relating to the Pakistan consortium, latterly Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending&#13;
program, IDA [International Development Association] lending program, I was very&#13;
much a part of that.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the big thing at that time was the Tarbela dam, that project which was being&#13;
packaged together. So I remember at that time there were several missions from the&#13;
Bank, but I was not so much involved with the Tarbela negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
But I was involved in preparation for the annual Pakistan consortium meetings. And&#13;
there, of course, what mattered was what happened to the lending program, what was the&#13;
rate of disbursement, how the projects were behaving, how the projects were proceeding.&#13;
These were the main considerations. The policy lending had not yet come in, so it was&#13;
mainly project-related activities. We used to process negotiating teams going to&#13;
Washington because all the negotiations used to be in Washington. And then there used&#13;
to be an Executive Director, I think it was Osman Ali who was Executive Director, and&#13;
we used to be in touch with him about various policy issues that were coming to the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Board [of Executive Directors]; he wanted feedback from the government. Those&#13;
are the type of work that I used to . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And you were at the Finance Ministry at the . . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: In the Finance Ministry, of course, I was more associated with the&#13;
[International Monetary] Fund than the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. This time that youâ&#128;&#153;re speaking of just now, you were thenâ&#128;&#148;that EAD,&#13;
was that in a ministry or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, EADâ&#128;&#153;s a ministry, itâ&#128;&#153;s Economic Affairs Division.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of which ministry?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: This was part of the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay, okay. You were there when the, in 19 . . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: I was there from â&#128;&#153;67 to â&#128;&#153;70.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, I see. Where were you in â&#128;&#153;71?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: In â&#128;&#153;71 I was Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Finance. I was&#13;
promoted to Joint Secretary in 1970, so I went over to the Ministry of Finance. I stayed&#13;
there until probably February or March â&#128;&#153;72 when we were all laid off because we decided&#13;
to [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: All the Bengalis, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Right, right. Well, in the Ministry of Finance my association with&#13;
the Bank was that I was on the board of directors of the IDBP, the Industrial&#13;
Development Bank of Pakistan, and the PICIC [Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment&#13;
Corporation]. And they used to borrow money from the Bank, so that was myâ&#128;&#148;and that&#13;
was more businesslike and things were much easier than negotiating projects with the&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Those were the DFIs [development finance institutions] with Bill [William]&#13;
Diamond.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Pardon?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Bill Diamond of the Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bill Diamond was . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, Bill Diamond wasâ&#128;&#148;yes, Bill Diamond was working on that,&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. And from the Bank side it was Mr. [I. Peter M.] Cargill.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, Peter.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Then [Rudolf] Hablutzel, there was a gentleman called Hablutzel,&#13;
who probablyâ&#128;&#148;I think he, Hablutzel, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether heâ&#128;&#153;s still at the Bank. Then&#13;
we had a gentleman who died later on when I was in Washington, became director of the&#13;
South Asia Department, Manfred Blobel. Manfred was, I think he was division director&#13;
at that time, and then Mike [Michael] Wiehen, who is currently director of that, they were&#13;
working on Pakistan. Mike Wiehen was the division chief in the later days of Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
Then when I came to Bangladesh, I was appointed Secretary, Ministry of Planning, and&#13;
Secretary, External Resources, so these two jobs were combined. And I had veryâ&#128;&#148;how&#13;
should I sayâ&#128;&#148;intimate interaction with the Bank. But at that time, you know, the&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
relationship between the government and the Bank was very difficult because the Bank&#13;
on behalf of the donorsâ&#128;&#148;well, before that I think I should mention a little bit about what&#13;
happened in â&#128;&#153;71.&#13;
&#13;
In â&#128;&#153;71, as you know, the Bank stopped its disbursements on projects in Pakistan. And&#13;
then these famous report which Bank staff had brought out, led by a young Dutch staff&#13;
member [Hendrik] van der Heijden.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Van der Heijden.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yeah, later on I saw him; he was with the OECD [Organization for&#13;
Economic Cooperation and Development]. I met him a couple of times in Paris.&#13;
&#13;
That report really brought out what was happening in East Pakistan in those days, the&#13;
atrocities and the complete cessation of all economic and business activities, all these.&#13;
And interestinglyâ&#128;&#148;you know, I was at that time, as I said, I was in the ministry of&#13;
finance, I was an alternate governor of the Fund. In that capacity I had to attend the 1971&#13;
annual meetings in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I should also probably mention that my first annual meeting was 1970 Copenhagen&#13;
meeting when Mr. [Robert S.] McNamara received a lot of, you know, eggs and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: From the left, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, from the left, so I remember that distinctly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s also the&#13;
first time I saw Mr. McNamara, and I met him as part of the Pakistan delegation.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, at the â&#128;&#153;71 annual meetings, the Pakistan delegation was led by a man called S.&#13;
U. Durrani. He was the governor of the central bank. We went and saw Mr. McNamara.&#13;
And Durrani was, of course, explaining that things were going all right in Pakistan and in&#13;
East Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember one particular incident thatâ&#128;&#148;during our meeting with Mr. McNamara,&#13;
Durrani was saying, â&#128;&#156;Oh, Mr. President, you donâ&#128;&#153;t worry. Things are going all right;&#13;
economic activities have revived. Weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to give full support to the jute trade;&#13;
weâ&#128;&#153;re flying cash to the various centers of trading for buying of jute so that farmers donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
suffer; and we are giving police escorts to all these special teams who are carrying gas&#13;
because we want really to help the farmers.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And Mr. McNamara grimly said, â&#128;&#156;Mr. Governor, in a situation where you have to fly&#13;
money out in a helicopter with a police escort is certainly not a normal situation.â&#128;&#157; That&#13;
stopped all further discussions.&#13;
&#13;
So that was . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He himself wasâ&#128;&#148;wasnâ&#128;&#153;t he perceived as being quite sympathetic to the east, to&#13;
Bangladesh?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Well, I could not decipher that, but obviously he was in favor of&#13;
stability and law and order and equity and justice and an equitable and just response to&#13;
the political aspirations of the people of East Pakistan who were--of course, by that time&#13;
it was too late. It was September, and theâ&#128;&#148;it was--the war of liberation had already&#13;
started in full fury and there was already the point of no return.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The report which you mentioned, the van der Heijden, I guess it was leaked&#13;
out. This was in June of â&#128;&#153;71 . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Youâ&#128;&#153;re right. June, July it was leaked out, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Do you remember the reactions from government?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Oh, the reactions in the Pakistan government, the Pakistan&#13;
government people, the senior officials, they were completelyâ&#128;&#148;what should I sayâ&#128;&#148;they&#13;
were furious. They were very angry, very unhappy, and I think the government of&#13;
Pakistan suggested that van der Heijden should be removed from the Bank or something&#13;
like that.&#13;
&#13;
And then I also remember that during the annual meetings in 1971 there was a special&#13;
meeting of donors for Pakistan called to consider Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s request for rescheduling&#13;
some of its debts. I think that was the first time that Pakistanâ&#128;&#148;Pakistan was in very bad&#13;
shape as far as balance of payments was concerned. And there was a special meeting&#13;
requesting for rescheduling some of these debt obligations. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s all I remember from&#13;
the â&#128;&#153;71 annual meetings.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The official reason for the Bank suspending further loans to Pakistan was debt,&#13;
because of debt repayment problems.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. I think it wasâ&#128;&#148;in East Pakistan it was obviously&#13;
the conditions did not permit smooth implementation of projects and the regular&#13;
disbursement of funds. That was the reason.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, but they stopped also to West Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: But that wasâ&#128;&#148;well, that was probably a little later. That was&#13;
probably a little later. Whether that was related to debt, that I donâ&#128;&#153;t at this stage recall&#13;
fully.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At minimum if they suspended East Pakistan because of turbulence . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                               November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . and they thought there was a certain equity of being, arising between East&#13;
and West Pakistan, they would not have continued to lend to the West, I should think. I&#13;
mean, that would be a tilt to the . . .&#13;
&#13;
My impression at the time, of being just recently associated with the U.S. Government,&#13;
was that when the U.S. tilted, the [Henry A.] Kissinger- [Richard M.] Nixon tilt towards&#13;
Pakistan at the end of â&#128;&#153;71 was very much in contrast to the posture of the Bank under&#13;
McNamara, that he parted company with the U.S. Administration.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Well, I must say that at that time, it was the later months of 1971, I&#13;
was notâ&#128;&#148;I mean, this should not go into the recordâ&#128;&#148;though I was in the government of&#13;
Pakistan I was in a very key position. Joint Secretary, External Finance, was the linchpin&#13;
regarding management of the foreign exchange budget, relationship with the donors,&#13;
relationship with the Fund and so on, but I could feel that I was being left out of some&#13;
very important discussions, like I was supposed to monitor day to day the foreign&#13;
exchange reserves. Then from a point of time the gold reserves were removed, first they&#13;
were brought to Islamabad, then they were shifted to China by the Pakistan government. I&#13;
was kept completely out of that. So at that time there were many occasions when I was&#13;
not in the--privy to the discussions the government had. But then in 19--sorry.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was just going to pick upâ&#128;&#148;you had led us to your position as Secretary here&#13;
at the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yeah. When I came to Bangladesh from Pakistan it was early â&#128;&#153;73,&#13;
January â&#128;&#153;73. I was stuck up for one full year in Pakistan. The whole, throughout â&#128;&#153;72 I&#13;
was in Pakistan, laid off and living on small doles from the Pakistan government. Then I&#13;
escaped with my family through Kabul, through the tribal areas with the help of tribal&#13;
people. They brought us across the border, and then we came to Kabul. We stayed there&#13;
for two weeks, and then we came to Delhi, from Delhi we came here.&#13;
&#13;
So when I reached Dhaka I was appointed Secretary, Ministry of Planning, and&#13;
concurrently Secretary, External Affairs Division. And that was the main link with the&#13;
donors; Secretary, External Resources Division, was the main link with the donors.&#13;
&#13;
At that time the relationship between the Bangladesh government and the donors was a&#13;
bit difficult. Mr. McNamara made a visitâ&#128;&#148;that was before I reached Bangladeshâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
the main thing was the debts. Donors were suggesting that Bangladesh should take over&#13;
the liabilities for debts, foreign debts, foreign loans, which were spent in East Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
So we had the first aid group meeting in, I think it was March of 1973, two months after&#13;
my arrival. And that meetingâ&#128;&#148;I remember distinctly because I was handling that&#13;
meeting myselfâ&#128;&#148;that the main issue was whether Bangladesh should agree to accept the&#13;
liability for foreign loans taken by Pakistan government and spent in East Pakistan. And&#13;
obviously the position of the Bangladesh government was that we were not willing to&#13;
take this; this was the legal liability of the government of Pakistan. And the donors were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
indicating that unless the government of Bangladesh agreed on this, there would be&#13;
difficulty in pledging new aid for Bangladesh, which Bangladesh badly needed.&#13;
&#13;
So moral number two was: how would the meeting be conducted. The World Bank&#13;
insisted that the meeting insisted that the meeting should be chaired by the Bank. Peter&#13;
Cargill was the person; he wanted to preside. And the Bangladesh governmentâ&#128;&#153;s position&#13;
was that no, it is the government who should preside over the meeting. And ultimately&#13;
government won that round, and the Bangladesh government delegate, Nurul Islam,&#13;
presided over that meeting. And that was the first meeting of the Bangladesh aid.&#13;
&#13;
But the message came quite clear in that meeting, though there were some pledges of&#13;
humanitarian aid, food aid and so on, but development aid, the donors made it quite clear&#13;
that they wonâ&#128;&#153;t be able to move until there was a decision on the debt obligations. And&#13;
this was widely discussed within the government, and there was noâ&#128;&#148;there was no two&#13;
opinions. The government was pretty firm that these loans legally were incurred by the&#13;
Pakistan government, so theyâ&#128;&#153;re legally liable.&#13;
&#13;
In the mean time Pakistan had also suspended payment of debts to the foreign donors, to&#13;
the lenders . .&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: . . this debt obligation, the Pakistan government had also suspended&#13;
payment of debt because their balance of payments position was also very precarious.&#13;
And I remember that the Pakistan government had obtained the time from the donors for,&#13;
I think, a period of moratorium up to 30th of June 1974. And the Bank was desperately&#13;
trying on behalf of the donors to come to an agreement with the Bangladesh government.&#13;
&#13;
Now, at that stage I was deeply involved in these whole process, and I was the&#13;
Bangladesh governmentâ&#128;&#153;s official negotiator for rescheduling of, discussion on debts,&#13;
foreign debts. And that exercise in which I had very close association with the Bankâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Mr. Bill Diamond, he had by that time become the country director; there was a division&#13;
chief called David Dunn; and there was a deputy director of the legal department, I think&#13;
his name was Douglas, Douglas Fontein, a Dutchman. And I had to discuss with them a&#13;
number of times.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Just Faaland didnâ&#128;&#153;t get involved in that?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Just Faaland was the Res Rep [resident representative] here of the&#13;
Bank. He was, of course, carrying all these messages between the government and the&#13;
Bank and through the Bank with the donors.&#13;
&#13;
Now how the thing got resolved, it is very interesting. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a long process, but I can tell&#13;
you briefly. At that time Sheik Mujibur Rahman, he was our prime minister. He was a&#13;
charismatic leader, the father of the nation, and we were allâ&#128;&#148;at that time, the new&#13;
country, we were, everybody was looking up to Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the great leader,&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
called him â&#128;&#156;Bangabandhu,â&#128;&#157; father of nation. And when these things were getting really a&#13;
little bitter, one day we had a discussion in the presence of the prime minister. And there&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Nurul Islam, was there, and the&#13;
Finance Minister, Mr. Tajuddin Ahmedâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#153;s now dead; he was later on killed in the&#13;
jailâ&#128;&#148;he was there; and some other officers; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent&#13;
someone. And then we explained that, â&#128;&#156;This is the legal situation. These loans were&#13;
legally incurred by the Pakistan government. Itâ&#128;&#153;s true some of these loans were spent in&#13;
what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh but legally we cannot take these&#13;
responsibilities at all because we donâ&#128;&#153;t know how these loans were spent. Many of them&#13;
are spent by central government agencies; we donâ&#128;&#153;t have the accounts,â&#128;&#157; and so on. Now,&#13;
at the same time it became quite clear that Bangladesh would need to re-establish its&#13;
relationship with the donors bilaterally. We preferred to deal with the problem&#13;
bilaterally. Now, I rememberâ&#128;&#148;it was a dramatic thingâ&#128;&#148;we were coming down the stairs&#13;
of the prime ministerâ&#128;&#153;s house, and as he was smoking his pipe he suddenly asked, â&#128;&#156;Well,&#13;
these projects that were built up, that were built with these foreign loans, are they still in&#13;
Bangladesh? Can you show me one or two of them? If they are there, then I will accept&#13;
the liability. If theyâ&#128;&#153;re not there, I have nothing to do with them.â&#128;&#157; So we got the policy&#13;
guideline from that.&#13;
&#13;
And then we built up our case. We went into the details, loan by loan. And then we&#13;
formulated our position, official position, with the approval of the government:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Bangladesh government will agree to take over the liabilities of those projects which are&#13;
visibly located in Bangladesh.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No program loans?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: No program loans. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll come to youâ&#128;&#148;with that I had problems,&#13;
program loans. But my point wasâ&#128;&#148;on this I was able to carry the government with meâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
that program loans were made available to individual importers who had paid in local&#13;
currency, these were their obligations. The foreign exchange liability remained with the&#13;
Pakistan government. As far as East Pakistan is concerned, they had absolutely no&#13;
liabilities left unfulfilled. It was like buying cash foreign exchange from the central bank.&#13;
They had bought the foreign exchange proceeds of the foreign loans with local currency&#13;
and they had absolutely no liability. So the question of accepting the liabilities for&#13;
program loans did not arise at all. And I was able to convince the Bankâ&#128;&#148;first I was able&#13;
to convince my government and later on the Bank representatives.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, now having accepted that, then we prepared our negotiating position like that, like&#13;
this: a particular project is maybe located, visibly located in Bangladesh; letâ&#128;&#153;s say a huge&#13;
jute mill which was built up with IDA loans or textile mill. But if during the war of&#13;
liberation the mill was damaged, then we would have to deduct from the loan the value&#13;
for the damages. This is number one. And then loan by loan we had to go back, up to&#13;
which installment the loans were really paid by the projects, though they were not&#13;
probably repaid by the Pakistan government because the lending was for a smaller period,&#13;
IDA for fifty years, maybe they would lend to the project, to the province for twenty-five&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we had paid, though Bank group said, â&#128;&#156;No, we have not received those installments.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
We said, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re not concerned with that. The people in East Pakistan, the projects in&#13;
East Pakistan, they have repaid their obligations.â&#128;&#157; So we were able to negotiate project&#13;
by project and to reduce our liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
And then I remember one interesting case, an IDA credit which was given to the&#13;
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan. And part of that loan, credit, was&#13;
reallocated to East Pakistan Agricultural Development Bank. And that loan was used for&#13;
buying mostly tractors and tillers, equipment which was stillâ&#128;&#148;some of the equipment&#13;
was still in possession of farmers and some tea gardens and sugar cane plantations and so&#13;
on. So there was a problem regarding that, but I maintained my point that these, the&#13;
Agricultural Development Bank in East Pakistan, they had used this money as a program&#13;
loan. The partakers, the users, they had repaid their obligations by paying in local&#13;
currency. So thereâ&#128;&#153;s no more obligation left for East Pakistan. Ultimately I was able to&#13;
convince that also.&#13;
&#13;
So taking the program loans and the project loans separately and then taking credit for&#13;
damages done during the war of liberation, theâ&#128;&#148;originally the figure that the donors&#13;
were holding before us was twelve hundred million dollars, that East Pakistan was liable&#13;
for twelve hundred million dollars out of one loan.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That is in â&#128;&#153;73 dollars?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: That is in â&#128;&#152;73 dollars, yes. Well, these were actually the amounts&#13;
mentioned in the loan agreements.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Cumulative, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes. Now, after these negotiations, getting rid of the program&#13;
loans, getting rid of damaged projects which were not visible, getting rid of partly&#13;
damaged projects, ultimately we came down to a figure of four hundred million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You did very well.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: From twelve hundred million dollars toâ&#128;&#148;the interesting part is still&#13;
I have not told youâ&#128;&#148;to four hundred million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
Now, at that timeâ&#128;&#148;well, then we negotiated. Our position was that weâ&#128;&#153;ll negotiated&#13;
bilaterally; weâ&#128;&#153;ll not negotiate multilaterally with the Bank. With the Bank weâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
negotiate only the IDA credits or IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development] loans. So we negotiated one by one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I remember those were very, very hectic days for me. Every day there was some&#13;
meeting. The Bank organized two discussion meetings; I think one was in Paris, one was&#13;
in London. I had to--those were specifically for the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s credit.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when we came toâ&#128;&#148;well, in the case of Bank also, I think the Bank made a very&#13;
special dispensation because we agreed that we shall accept these loans only on DSA&#13;
[debt service agreement] terms, on the softest terms available from any bilateral donor,&#13;
those are the DSA terms.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: So bilaterally the donors agreed to that, that we would repay, we&#13;
would assume the obligations on DSA terms. But in the case of the Bank, I think there&#13;
was a small amount of IBRD loan you still find in the documents; those are the IBRD&#13;
loans. And there the Bank made a special dispensation because Bangladesh was not&#13;
eligible for IBRD loans in â&#128;&#153;74. They made a special dispensation so we could take over&#13;
the liabilities of that.&#13;
&#13;
And at that time Just Faaland made a very interesting suggestion to me one day. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Okay, now you have come to this situation.â&#128;&#157; Well, we had more or less cleared with all&#13;
the bilateral donors except Italy. Italy, we had not yet agreed, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Italy, the&#13;
last agreement was signed until 1986. But in the case of Italy it was only [inaudible] . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: . . and a whole series of problems, insurance and repayment, all&#13;
these, and differences of small amounts and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Just Faaland told me that, â&#128;&#156;Look,â&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;he unofficially made this suggestionâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;we&#13;
have now come to this figure, four hundred million dollars, and the DSA terms have an&#13;
84 percent grant element, so in effect your debt is sixteen million dollars for every&#13;
hundred million dollars. Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you tell the donors that, â&#128;&#152;Give us a consolidated loan&#13;
of sixty-four million dollars. Weâ&#128;&#153;ll repay you with that; weâ&#128;&#153;ll start from the scratch with&#13;
a loan of sixty-four million dollarsâ&#128;&#153;?â&#128;&#157; I tried it with a couple of donors. They were not at&#13;
all willing to take this up. But that was a very interesting suggestion. At that time&#13;
Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s balance of payments situation, foreign exchange situation, was very&#13;
difficult, and it would have made good sense. But it made sense only on the books of&#13;
economics and accounts, but in real life nobody agreed to touch this, the so-called grant&#13;
element and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Help me to understand. He suggested that you get a new loan for the grant&#13;
element of your, that term . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, you get a loan from somewhere, sixty-four million dollars . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And then wipe out the whole thing.&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: . . then you pay the current, this present value of this four hundred&#13;
million dollars with 84 percent grant element, which is sixteen percent, which is sixty-&#13;
four.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You should have gotten Norway to do that for you.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Norway wasâ&#128;&#148;were they so rich at that time?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, no, they didnâ&#128;&#153;t have their oil in at that time.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: So it would have been very interesting to be able to do that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, in thisâ&#128;&#148;I remember--I reviewed the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s history in Pakistan at one&#13;
time a few years ago, and this was a, as you say, also very troubled issue for them for a&#13;
long time, the Bank and Pakistan. This was aâ&#128;&#148;you talk about negotiation between you&#13;
and the donors. The assumption is that whatever you get out of would be . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Acceptable to Pakistan. Well, you know the Bank was mediating.&#13;
They were traveling back and forth between Pakistan and Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
Andâ&#128;&#148;oh, one more thing. We had agreed that we would take over the liabilities worked&#13;
out like this as on July 1, 1974. So until June 30, 1973, all liabilities were with the&#13;
Pakistan government. We did not agree to pick up the tab from the 16th of December â&#128;&#152;71.&#13;
We made it quite clear that we will accept it only from the first of July 1974.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, these were very exciting days. Now as we cleared one after another bilateral&#13;
negotiations, we were entering into fresh bilateral agreements with the donors. And we&#13;
also resumed our relationship with IDA. In December â&#128;&#153;73 IDA agreed to provide the first&#13;
program loan, program credit, for Bangladesh. I think it was fifty million dollars. I went&#13;
for negotiating that first credit.&#13;
&#13;
And then, of course, the project lending started, because in the later days, it was the end&#13;
of the Pakistan period, the Bank had undertaken a nine-volume land and water use study&#13;
for Bangladesh. Now in that study a number of projects were identified for long-term&#13;
investment in the agriculture sector, in water and agriculture sector in Bangladesh: flood&#13;
control, drainage, irrigation, all of these. And we started negotiation with the Bank on&#13;
the basis of that document. The projects that arrived [inaudible] considered by the&#13;
Bangladesh Planning Commission was review, and ultimately, I think, the Planning&#13;
Commission, between the Planning Commission and the IDA, we agreed on eleven major&#13;
projects--not major projects, eleven projects which were based on a new philosophy,&#13;
because in Pakistan days, the Bank had gone for big projects: dams, big irrigation&#13;
projects, large embankment projects, for flood control, drainage and irrigation. Now for&#13;
the first time there was a change in the perspective and in perception, and the government&#13;
and the IDA agreed that henceforth lending in the water sector in the agricultural sector&#13;
should be for small irrigation projects: surface water, pumps, shallow or mid-depth&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
specialty wells, and then deeper wells. No more of those big irrigation projects and dams&#13;
and embankments, so that was one interesting thing I remember.&#13;
&#13;
Now what happened in the course of all these negotiationsâ&#128;&#148;I think the last was with the&#13;
U.S. because U.S. law, I think, did not permit writing off loan ofâ&#128;&#148;oh, this is--now I&#13;
remember. So what we did with the U.S., we agreed that, â&#128;&#156;Yes, well, if your law does&#13;
not permit writing, what youâ&#128;&#153;ll do, youâ&#128;&#153;ll accept the loan figures arrived at on that basis&#13;
but then you change theâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;was it to the U.S. or the Bank?â&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;you change the maturity of&#13;
the loan so that in effect we get a grant element [inaudible] purpose.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The U.S.â&#128;&#148;I think it must have been with the Bank because the U.S. had a&#13;
grant element of . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yeah, I agree, I think, yes, you are right. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why our loan, the&#13;
initial loan from the Bank was for a very long period so that the grant element was&#13;
brought down to the debt terms, to 84 percent. So that was an unusual measure taken by&#13;
the Bank at that time.&#13;
&#13;
So thatâ&#128;&#153;s how we resumed our relationship with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Fascinating story.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: And then also gradually we . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How long did you continue as the Secretary for aid coordination?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Well, I continued until end of â&#128;&#153;75, throughout the period of the first&#13;
government. And in February â&#128;&#153;76 I was shifted by the new government as Secretary for&#13;
Finance when Ziaur Rahman became president. He brought me--much against my&#13;
wishes--as Secretary, Finance. I was there for two years; then I went to the Bank as&#13;
Alternate ED [Executive Director].&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. How long were you there as the Alternate ED?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: I was there five years.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Five years.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: I came back in October of â&#128;&#153;82. I joined the Bank in July â&#128;&#153;77, came&#13;
back October â&#128;&#153;82.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that I remember from that periodâ&#128;&#148;well, apart from negotiationsâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
those days we, my office, the External Resources, ERD, External Resources Division,&#13;
used to be responsible for all aid negotiations, also project by project negotiations with&#13;
the Bank. So I had to visit Washington quite frequently, several times a year, in&#13;
connection with groups and negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Were you succeeded by Muhith in that job, A.M.A. Muhith?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, yes, Muhith--no, I was succeeded by a gentlemen called&#13;
Mister Mahmood, Kafiluddin Mahmood, for about a year and a half. And then when I&#13;
left for Washington, roughly the same time Muhith came and take over the job of&#13;
External Resources Division.&#13;
&#13;
Well, the other thing that I rememberâ&#128;&#148;well, these negotiations of the program loans, of&#13;
course, were dealt. The next thing was, the event was the organization of the Bangladesh&#13;
aid group. That was in September â&#128;&#153;74. In â&#128;&#153;74 Bangladesh faced a very serious crisis.&#13;
We had very bad floods which destroyed part of the summer crop and the jute crop. We&#13;
had a severe explosion in our only ongoing urea fertilizer factory, production was&#13;
suspended. There was a succession of bad crops. Food stock was very low, and there was&#13;
acute scarcity of food grains in the northern part in the lean period. And there was, of&#13;
course, as you probably know, there were deaths due to starvation. There has been a&#13;
number of figures mentioned and there has been exaggeration, but it was quite serious. A&#13;
large number of people died of starvation in the final quarter of 1974 in the northern part&#13;
of Bangladesh. But in September â&#128;&#153;74 when we desperately needed to import food grains,&#13;
our foreign exchange situation was very, very low. The budget situation was [inaudible]&#13;
also, very grim. And Bangladesh faced the most difficult situation at that time.&#13;
&#13;
And we in the Planning Commissionâ&#128;&#148;Nurul Islam was still there; he was my bossâ&#128;&#148;we&#13;
had, putting our heads together how to get over this. And obviously the conclusion that&#13;
we came was that we needed foreign aid, we needed external assistance, external actors.&#13;
And the Bank was not in a position to bring out quick disbursing cash money. It was&#13;
notâ&#128;&#148;we already had the second import program credit under negotiationâ&#128;&#148;well, I think&#13;
we had already, yeah, we had already signed, and that was being used but that was a&#13;
small amount again, 50 or 55 million dollars. Now what we needed was immediate cash&#13;
for import of food grains, immediate cash for import of raw materials, spare parts for our&#13;
industries. And for food, I remember, Soviet Russia, they were very helpful to us at that&#13;
time. I remember the Soviet ambassador came to see me, and he told me that he had got&#13;
instructions from Moscow to divert two shiploads of food, which was going somewhere&#13;
else, to divert from the middle of the Indian Ocean and to send them to Chittagong. That&#13;
was a great help.&#13;
&#13;
We were negotiating a PL-480 [U.S. Public Law 480] agreement with the U.S&#13;
government. I was negotiating with the U.S. government. They did not yet have an AID&#13;
[U.S. Agency for International Development] mission here. They had an office of AID&#13;
coordinator, a gentlemen called Tony [Anthony M.] Schwarzwalder was in charge of the&#13;
office here.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: And later onâ&#128;&#148;I remember the--I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember the man who&#13;
came later on. I think it was--the first ambassador was Eugene, I think it was [Davis]&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eugene Boster, Eugene Boster or Ed [Edward E.] Masters. Anyway I forgotten. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not&#13;
sure.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Schwarzwalder was here for some time, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, but he was in charge of the AID coordination office. The first&#13;
U.S. ambassador was, I think it was Ed Masters, who came from Indonesia, I think, or&#13;
Eugene Boster. I think it was Ed Masters. Or maybe there was not yet an ambassador&#13;
because Tony Schwarzwalder was [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
And there we came across this difficulty because we were also negotiating export of jute&#13;
goods to Cuba.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: And the Americans, they were very particular that those shipments&#13;
must be out of the port before American food grain ships could come into Chittagong.&#13;
Well, these things are fully documented elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, Iâ&#128;&#153;m aware of this.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Youâ&#128;&#153;ll probably find them in the U.S., including the Foreign Affairs&#13;
journal and other places. And that delayed shipment of food under PL-480. Well, this&#13;
has been . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was a very costly delay, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: It was a costly delay, though it has been contradicted by the U.S.&#13;
government that thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing like political punishment for Bangladesh, but most&#13;
people in the country, they perceived that particular event as a reflection of U.S.&#13;
punishing Bangladesh for so many things. Henry Kissinger was still there, the Secretary&#13;
of State and so on; he was not particularly favorably disposed toward Bangladesh and so&#13;
on.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, now, well, that was for a short period, short term thing, but looking at the&#13;
medium term we still felt that unless there was an inflow of foreign capital it would be&#13;
very difficult for us to continue the economic activities at the level we wanted to. We&#13;
could probablyâ&#128;&#148;we could probably carry on economic activity at a much lower level,&#13;
and that was, that was a very critical time. So the question was should we request the&#13;
donors to come to our aid? If so, what should be the mechanism? And the mechanism&#13;
that we agreed within the government was that we should go according to the format&#13;
which India and Pakistan were following, which is the aid consortium meeting.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Chaired by the Bank, huh?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Chaired by the Bank, yes. And somehowâ&#128;&#148;I remember within the&#13;
government when we were debating this we were allergic to the term â&#128;&#156;consortiumâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
because it smacked of the Pakistan consortium, it smacked of the colonial period&#13;
arrangements for some countries. So we decidedâ&#128;&#148;at my suggestionâ&#128;&#148;we agreed to call&#13;
it â&#128;&#156;Bangladesh aid groupâ&#128;&#157; not the â&#128;&#156;Bangladesh consortium.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And at that time we had sent an aide memoire to the bilateral donors and also to the--we&#13;
sent a message to the Bank, saying that we wouldâ&#128;&#148;well, we sent an aide memoire to the&#13;
Bank also, saying that we worked out a medium-term scenario of our balance of&#13;
payments situation, and we gave it to the Bank. And the Bank response was that, â&#128;&#156;Well,&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mechanism does not permit any short-term, quick disbursing funds to be made&#13;
available to the government.â&#128;&#157; The Bank was willing to organize a meeting for the aid&#13;
donors, and then the Bank would have to prepare some documentation, and they asked&#13;
the Bangladesh government also to place our requirements in the standard format of&#13;
balance of payments analyses, the scenario for the next eighteen months and so on.&#13;
&#13;
We did all these. And the first aid group meeting was in October 1974, held in Paris,&#13;
chaired by the Bank. And we gotâ&#128;&#148;I think we got pledges, I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember now what&#13;
was the figure; 800 million dollars or something--pledges for food aid, commodity aid,&#13;
[inaudible] program aid, and also project aid.&#13;
&#13;
And then by the end of â&#128;&#153;74, the beginning of â&#128;&#153;75â&#128;&#148;this was October â&#128;&#153;74â&#128;&#148;end of â&#128;&#153;74,&#13;
beginning of â&#128;&#153;75, things were turning up for the better. The winter crop was good; the&#13;
government had handled the post-crisis situation in the northern part of the country quite&#13;
well; the winter crop was coming out quite well; there was a downward trend in the price&#13;
level. And we agreed with the Fund at that time to enter into a standby arrangement&#13;
because the exchange rate had become unrealistic. We started parallel with the Indian&#13;
rupee, 7.5 taka per dollar. And that was obviously unsustainable because we had very&#13;
high levels of inflation. In â&#128;&#153;72-â&#128;&#153;73 I think it wasâ&#128;&#148;in â&#128;&#153;72 I think it was 35 percent, in â&#128;&#153;73&#13;
it was 40 percent, in â&#128;&#153;74 something like 80 percent.&#13;
&#13;
So then we had--in early May â&#128;&#153;75 we went for a de-monitization exercise, we brought&#13;
down the circulation and then price level, effect on the price level. And there was&#13;
restraint on credit to the government from the banking system because government had&#13;
nationalized a large part of the organized industrial sector, they were dependent on the&#13;
commercial banks, which were also nationalized. And government itself, because the&#13;
revenue collection had not yet been properly organized, government also had to borrow&#13;
from the central banks. All this combined, and the structural difficulties, transportation&#13;
difficulties, international inflation, price of oil, price of food grain, price of cotton, iron&#13;
and steel, fertilizer, everything [inaudible] To correct for that we had to . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side 1]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: . . we entered the standby agreement with the Fund. The major&#13;
element was the depreciation of the taka by 58 percent, from 7.5 taka to the dollar we&#13;
&#13;
                                    M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                               November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
went to 12.5 taka to the dollar. The Bank joined in because in the scenario that we had&#13;
projected for our balance of payment for the coming year at the Paris aid group meeting&#13;
in which we [inaudible] certain [inaudible] resources from the Fund and the Bank agreed&#13;
to give us a third program credit for one hundred million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
So I also negotiated that credit, and surprisingly that negotiation took place in Dhaka,&#13;
across a table like this without an exchange of papers, because the basic understanding&#13;
was already there. The main thing which the Bank wanted to see--IDA wanted to see--&#13;
was adjustment of the exchange rate and this bringing down the money supply and so on&#13;
as suggested by the Fund. So Bank was really looking up to the Fund for working out the&#13;
arrangements under the standby, and Bank agreed to provide a hundred million dollar&#13;
third program credit. So that negotiation was in Dhaka, and across the board without any&#13;
lawyers, without formal meetings between the two sides. I remember David Dunn and I,&#13;
in the course of our discussions, agreed that the IDA credit would be taken to the Board&#13;
and it was done in due course. We got that money.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was â&#128;&#153;74?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: That was â&#128;&#153;75.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;75, right, right.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Now in May â&#128;&#153;75 we did this devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: And then the prime minister, he had made an announcement,&#13;
national policy of government, amidst a Cabinet division, designating population as the&#13;
number one problem of Bangladesh. So we had several, you know, favorable factors.&#13;
One was the crop turned out to be good; the money supply had slowed down; the price&#13;
level was moving downwards. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;the policy initiatives were perceived&#13;
to be right by the economists at home and also the donors, particularly emphasis on&#13;
population planning and agriculture sector.&#13;
&#13;
And we had the second aid group meeting within the financial year. That was May of&#13;
â&#128;&#153;75â&#128;&#148;one was October â&#128;&#153;74, the other was May â&#128;&#153;75--so two aid group meetings within one&#13;
year. That was also an exception. And we had the oneâ&#128;&#148;the meeting was an overall&#13;
success. I think we got pledge of close to 150 million dollars, Paris aid group meeting.&#13;
So that was the second meeting.&#13;
&#13;
Thenâ&#128;&#148;yeah, then August â&#128;&#153;75 we had the change of the government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He was assassinated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                            November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, the prime minister, as you know, was assassinated by a faction&#13;
of the army. That was a very sad day for Bangladesh because--well, itâ&#128;&#153;s a sad and long&#13;
story; I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to go into that.&#13;
&#13;
Then the new government came into power, and there was some change in policy but&#13;
change only inâ&#128;&#148;what should I say--extent of changes not the direction. For example,&#13;
public and private investment, which was a low ceiling of only two point five million&#13;
taka was set by the government in 1972, that was already raised to thirty million taka by&#13;
the time the government had fallen. When the new government came into power they&#13;
raised it to a hundred million taka, [inaudible] taka. That was one.&#13;
&#13;
The other was accelerating the process of disinvestment--not denationalization. As you&#13;
remember, after the independence of Bangladesh, government had nationalized the jute&#13;
sector, the textile sector and the sugar sector. And then a very large number of small and&#13;
medium-sized industrial units were abandoned by non-local people, mostly Pakistanis, so&#13;
they had migrated to Pakistan. Now these industries and units, these were lying here so&#13;
government had to by force take over those units and they are being run by [inaudible]&#13;
appointees. And the government decidedâ&#128;&#148;even during the secritive government in those&#13;
daysâ&#128;&#148;the government decided that these should be gradually sold out in small units. So&#13;
when the new government came in they accelerated that process. And the government&#13;
also announced that much better opportunity would be provided to the private sector to&#13;
participate in economic activities. So the ceiling for private investment was raised,&#13;
denationalization was accelerated. Other than that I think the policies remained more or&#13;
less the same.&#13;
&#13;
At that time the President, President Ziaur Rahman, he had talked of denationalizing the&#13;
jute mills and the textile mills but he never quite gathered the courage, politically, to&#13;
really undertake that.&#13;
&#13;
At that time the relationship between the Bank and the government improved&#13;
significantly because Bank found these policies more acceptable than what the previous&#13;
government was following.&#13;
&#13;
So this was â&#128;&#153;75, â&#128;&#153;76. And then â&#128;&#153;77--what happened between those, â&#128;&#153;76 and â&#128;&#153;77, in our&#13;
relationship with the Bank? Well, we had these annual aid group meetings every year.&#13;
The system was developed. We had a meeting in â&#128;&#153;76; we had a meeting in â&#128;&#153;77; every&#13;
year. And until I retired from the governmentâ&#128;&#148;I left the government in â&#128;&#153;87â&#128;&#148;I had the&#13;
unique honor and privilege of attending all the meetings of the Bangladesh aid group,&#13;
fourteen or fifteen ultimately. That was unique.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One aside: when you were Alternate ED, how does the--on policy issues,&#13;
when you say [inaudible] the Indian EDs or the Indian representative as the ED for that,&#13;
Bangladesh is the Alternate, on the matter of policy issue within the Bank has it been&#13;
ever a case that there has been differences of opinion and, if so, how were they resolved?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                             November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: No. There was no differenceâ&#128;&#148;you mean between the ED and the&#13;
Alternate ED?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: No. There was never any occasion on which the Bangladesh&#13;
Government and the India Government would have to take different positions. We had&#13;
Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and later on came Bhutan. So I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember any&#13;
occasion where Bangladesh had to take a different position than India. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember&#13;
a single, particularly on the operational side. In fact, we are competing now for IDA&#13;
resources, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
About Bankâ&#128;&#153;s policy issues, I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember. Like, I thinkâ&#128;&#148;letâ&#128;&#153;s see. Membership of&#13;
the ICSID [International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]: Bangladesh&#13;
became a member of the ICSID; I think at that time India had not yet become a member.&#13;
Bangladesh became a member of IFC [International Finance Corporation]; I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
remember whether India had become already a member at that time--I think India had&#13;
already become in IFC.&#13;
&#13;
The only difference that arose which I rememberâ&#128;&#148;but that was when I was no longer ED&#13;
but was in the governmentâ&#128;&#148;that was about becoming member of the MIGA [Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency]. We wanted to become a member of the MIGA;&#13;
government of India, they decided not to become a member of MIGA. They had good&#13;
points, and Bangladesh government alsoâ&#128;&#148;because Bangladesh government was very&#13;
keen on attracting foreign investment, and Indian policy at that time was not so active.&#13;
So that was one point of departure I remember.&#13;
&#13;
Other than that, on policy issues Indian ED was the most vocal and respected in the&#13;
Board about representing the point of view of the low income countries, developing&#13;
countries. So there we always had a very fineâ&#128;&#148;I had the pleasure of working with very&#13;
fine EDs.&#13;
&#13;
I worked with S. R. Sen; Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure you know him. Heâ&#128;&#153;s coming for a visit next month.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is he?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yeah. Heâ&#128;&#153;s in Delhi right now.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, we were just there. I must admit we didnâ&#128;&#153;t see him. Please give him my&#13;
regards.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Sure, sure.&#13;
&#13;
Then [M.] Narasimhan, I worked with Narasimhan, whom I sure you know. He was&#13;
Governor of the Reserve Bank and the ADB also.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                            November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then I had a gentleman called H. N. Ray, former Secretary to the government of India.&#13;
&#13;
So I had worked with three EDs. I had no problem. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember any official when&#13;
we had . . .&#13;
&#13;
Well, there was the--I must, of course, mention, you know, these water disputes between&#13;
India and Pakistan and later on between India and Bangladesh. I remember once or&#13;
twice--there was a case, a case of an irrigation project on whichâ&#128;&#147;an irrigation project&#13;
involving a river which originated in India. And I think India government had a point of&#13;
view that this project needs to be looked at fresh, what in fact it has done, inter-riparian&#13;
water flows and so on. But it never really came to any serious difference of opinion,&#13;
taking extreme positions.&#13;
&#13;
And then about the eastern, the Ganges, sharing of Ganges water. The Bank had offered&#13;
several times to work out some investment package which would benefit the upper&#13;
riparian and the lower riparian because of basically what happened to the Ganges water,&#13;
decreasing supplies and increasing demand on other side. The Bank had suggested some&#13;
technical work, to be followed by investment programs. On that Bangladesh was always&#13;
open. Government of India was not very keen to follow that option, I remember. But&#13;
then it never gave rise to any bitterness in the office of the ED or in the relationship&#13;
between the External Resources Division and the DEA [Department of Economic Affairs,&#13;
Ministry of Finance] in Delhi because that was an ongoing problem between India and&#13;
Bangladesh being dealt in a separate forum, the joint U.S. commission [Indo-Bangladesh&#13;
Joint Rivers Commission] that was going on from 1974. So that is it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The waters, the division of waters you mean was being dealt with in the Joint&#13;
Commission?&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, sharing the Ganges water.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know about that.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Oh, in 1974 when Sheikh Mujibur was still the prime minister,&#13;
between Bangabandhu and Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi there was an agreement about sharing of&#13;
waters.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes. And that was supposed to be followed up by additional work&#13;
for augmenting prices and supplies. And then that agreement was supposed to go up to a&#13;
certain period. So when the next government came, the position, the government of&#13;
General Ziaur Rahman, that agreement was, I think, extended. And then the technical&#13;
work continued, but the technical experts on the two sides, on the joint U.S. commission-&#13;
-the joint U.S. commission was set up between the India government and the Bangladesh&#13;
government, consisting of experts. So the technical experts to the Joint River&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Commission, they did not see eye to eye. So that dispute continues even today, what is&#13;
going to happen to the . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the Joint Commission was between India and Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: No, itâ&#128;&#153;s a separate body known as Joint Rivers Commission. There&#13;
are some staff members always working on it, and then every six months I think thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
meeting, alternately in Delhi and Dhaka. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re still working on this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank hasnâ&#128;&#153;t, as far as you know, pressed very hard on that subject.&#13;
Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve offered, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s all.&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s all. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no agreement between the countries to go in&#13;
for this, and Bank would not come in unless the two governments agreed and jointly&#13;
requested the Bank that, â&#128;&#156;Yes, here we are. We are willing to accept your technical&#13;
support followed by investment program.â&#128;&#157; In general in this direction, there was&#13;
reservation on the side of India. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This has been a terrific account of the long relationship going to--just a fine&#13;
time trace of . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: Well recalling, I find itâ&#128;&#153;s very--it has been a good experience.&#13;
&#13;
When I came to the Bank in 1977 that was theâ&#128;&#148;what should I sayâ&#128;&#148;mature McNamara&#13;
period. The two things that McNamara used to push, one is, in quantitative terms,&#13;
doubling the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending program every five years. The other one, of course, was the&#13;
follow up of his famous Nairobi speech that the development strategies of the â&#128;&#152;50s and&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;60s were not taking us anywhere as far as reduction of poverty was concerned so the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s new style projects, attention to the small farmers, rural development projects,&#13;
those things were on the cards.&#13;
&#13;
And later on I also had the privilege of watching the early part of [Alden W.] Clausen,&#13;
who had come in as the new President of the Bank and a different perception. I&#13;
remember that during Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s period what mainly happenedâ&#128;&#148;of course, Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
arrival at the Bank was more or less just a year before the debt crisis started. So Clausen&#13;
brought in a lot of innovations in what we call financial engineering, this ways of raising&#13;
resources for the Bank, this swap arrangement, perpetual note, then loan A, B loan,&#13;
guaranteeing the later maturities to the commercial banks, various ways of making&#13;
resources available from the commercial market and the Bank to the debt-ridden&#13;
countries. I remember that was the main thing during Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s days.&#13;
&#13;
But McNamara days were really very inspiring. I recall these discussions in the Board,&#13;
his leadership in the Board. And it was quite clear that though the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s major&#13;
shareholders were really articulating the aid policies, [inaudible] institutions, even then,&#13;
but during McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s days we could feel that McNamara, because of his personality&#13;
and because of his contacts, he was in a position to really guide the major donors: â&#128;&#156;This&#13;
&#13;
                                   M. Syeduzzaman&#13;
                              November 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is how you should look at aid policy.â&#128;&#157; Though in theory it is the shareholders guiding the&#13;
Bank president, but in effect we could see that it was McNamara who was guiding the&#13;
donors.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember one incident during McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s days which was very interesting. You&#13;
know, when the Bank went into Vietnam with the lending program and I think certain&#13;
undertaking had to be given to the U.S. government. Clarence Long, he was chairman of&#13;
the [U.S. House of Representatives] Foreign Operations Committee, and McNamara had&#13;
given a letter to Clarence Long promising certain things on behalf of the Bank which the&#13;
Executive Directors did not like. And that was the first time I remember the Executive&#13;
Directors--some of the Executive Directors--were furious at McNamara for having done&#13;
that. I remember particularly a couple of Executive Directors from the ASEAN region&#13;
because Bank was opening up to Vietnam without fully consulting the Executive&#13;
Directors and after giving certain undertakings. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll try to recollect it, what that&#13;
undertaking was, that the Bank would not do certain things or . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He said the Bank wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to loan to Vietnam. They say now that he&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to anyway, but . .&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: â&#128;&#156;. . that even a man like you could sleep.â&#128;&#157; That I remember.&#13;
&#13;
Then briefly the Clausen period, I said.&#13;
&#13;
Then came the period of Conable, Barber Conable. I was still a minister in the&#13;
government, so I had occasion to meet with him at Annual Meetings. And that period I&#13;
remember that he came in the Bank, reorganization in the Bank which gave the Bank no--&#13;
in my view. And then his attitude towards the social sectors, which was very&#13;
pronounced: population, education, environment, and safe motherhood.&#13;
&#13;
And then, of course, I remember the period of structural adjustment loan, the genesis of&#13;
the structural adjustment loan in the Bank in â&#128;&#153;79-â&#128;&#153;80. Mahbub ul-Haq and Ernie [Ernest]&#13;
Stern, they were working it out after the Belgrade meeting of the Board of Governors.&#13;
That was another incident which I remember was really very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
And then the development of the policy framework paper concept for aiding the low&#13;
income countries, hand in hand with the Fund, and then bringing in the Structural&#13;
Adjustment Facility, SAF and ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility].&#13;
&#13;
So many things. Well, I could go on speaking for hours.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I can believe it.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s--the â&#128;&#156;concordâ&#128;&#157; meeting in â&#128;&#153;81, I was part of the&#13;
Bangladesh delegation, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s position on that. McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s personnel diplomacy in&#13;
that context.&#13;
&#13;
Maybe we have to talk another day if you want.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would be wonderful. We have a rather tight . .&#13;
&#13;
SYEDUZZAMAN: If you have any time, please let me know. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll be . .&#13;

            In November 1991, M. Syeduzzaman was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by John Lewis, Richard Webb, Devesh Kapur.
            M. Syeduzzaman joined the Bank as a Deputy Secretary in the
            Economic Affairs Division, Pakistan, in Islamabad. And later
            on, in ’70, I worked as Joint Secretary in the government of
            Pakistan, External Finance. He was involved in preparation
            for the annual Pakistan consortium meetings.  And there, of
            course, what mattered was what happened to the lending
            program, what was the rate of disbursement, how the projects
            were behaving, how the projects were proceeding.  These were
            the main considerations.  The policy lending had not yet
            come in, so it was mainly project-related activities.
