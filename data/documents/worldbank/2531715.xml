             Innovations in Bankruptcy--Pricing the&#13;
             Priority of Insolvency Claims&#13;
&#13;
Chad Leechor   Following the wave of recent financial turmoil, many developing countries have learned the&#13;
&#13;
               value of an effective bankruptcy system in deterring excessive use of debt and providing an&#13;
&#13;
               orderly way to resolve a debt crisis. As a result, they are now reforming their bankruptcy&#13;
&#13;
               systems, generally modeling them on those of advanced countries. But there is dissatisfaction&#13;
&#13;
               with bankruptcy frameworks in advanced countries too. Some alternatives have been&#13;
&#13;
               proposed. One is an options-based approach that provides an objective way of pricing&#13;
&#13;
               creditor claims according to priority. With allowances for local conditions, this approach&#13;
&#13;
               offers developing countries a chance to leapfrog existing bankruptcy practices and their&#13;
&#13;
               limitations.&#13;

               Effective bankruptcy systems have implications             It should be procedurally fair and efficient,&#13;

      Options are simple once you know a few basic rules. A call                 have strike prices of US$95, US$100, or US$105. A Microsoft call&#13;
      option gives you the right to buy the underlying security, say a           with a strike of US$95 is worth more than a call with a strike of&#13;
      common stock, at a stipulated price--the strike price, or strike.          US$100 or US$105.&#13;
      When the stock price rises, the value of your call goes up, and               You can buy a call option with one strike and sell a call on the&#13;
      when it falls, the value goes down. Owning a call is therefore             same security with another strike. This position is a call spread.&#13;
      similar to owning a stock. If you                                                                         Suppose you buy a Microsoft call at&#13;

            Innovations in bankruptcy : pricing the
            priority of insolvency claims
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Following the wave of recent financial
            turmoil, many developing countries have learned the value of
            an effective bankruptcy system in deterring excessive use of
            debt and providing an orderly way to resolve a debt crisis.
            As a result, they are now reforming their bankruptcy
            systems, generally modeling them on those of advanced
            countries. But there is dissatisfaction with bankruptcy
            frameworks in advanced countries too. Some alternatives have
            been proposed. One is an options-based approach that
            provides an objective way of pricing creditor claims
            according to priority. With allowances for local conditions,
            this approach offers developing countries a chance to
            leapfrog existing bankruptcy practices and their
            limitations. Effective bankruptcy systems have implications
            for corporate governance and for securities markets. For
            corporate managers and controlling shareholders, the cost of
            bankruptcy includes the loss of corporate control and the
            risk of personal liability. This threat serves as a
            restraint on the use of debt. In the event of default an
            efficient and orderly transfer of corporate control to
            creditors reduces the likelihood of asset stripping and
            looting by insiders. For creditors, available legal recourse
            makes it possible to extend credit at a reasonable cost. And
            in a cyclical downturn or in the face of financial distress,
            creditors are less likely to panic and liquidate securities
            on a massive scale.
