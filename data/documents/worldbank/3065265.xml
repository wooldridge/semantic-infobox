            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2003 : innovation, impact, sustainability -
            IFC's commitment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This annual report reviews the oerations
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2003. IFC's operating income for FY03 grew to $528
            million, more than triple the figure for FY02 and one of the
            highest on record. Its committed portfolio grew by 11.5
            percent to $16.8 billion. It was a year that emphasized
            coordination, and mutually reinforcing efforts among World
            Bank Group units, particularly in pursuing private sector
            development in client countries. The report stresses the
            need for support of IFC's priorities, including
            emerging, and frontier markets, technical assistance, and
            advisory services to help improve investment climates, and
            small and medium enterprises. Also underscored, is the
            significance of IFC's presence in difficult, country
            environments as a central component of its development
            mandate, while IFC's counter-cyclical role in the face
            of heightened investor uncertainty, and volatility of
            capital flows to developing countries, is recognized, as is
            the performance within the annual portfolio performance
            review, despite continued difficulty in the global economic
            environment. IFC's financial management is reviewed,
            and its leadership for protecting the Corporation's
            financial integrity, without compromising its development
            mandate, was commendable, though the need to maintain
            profitability, while increasing development impacts, is
            stressed. The report presents financial highlights,
            particularly outlining IFC's commitment to innovation,
            impact, and sustainability, and further identifies the
            period's operational, and regional outlook. The report
            also summarizes the financial and portfolio reviews, as well
            as technical assistance and advisory services during FY03.
