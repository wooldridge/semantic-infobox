         Overview of the&#13;
         Canadian Access System&#13;
&#13;
    Canada was once seen as a leader among                                 4.1 The Legislation&#13;

    ment of resources to access processes, and de-                         Canadaâ&#128;&#153;s ATIA 3 can be described as quasi-&#13;
    velopment of administrative practices to pro-                          constitutional because it overrides provisions&#13;
    mote openness. This is probably less true                              in other federal statutes (except those listed&#13;
    today. There are problems with the Canadian                            in a schedule attached to the act). This fea-&#13;
    access regime, as will become clear from the                           ture elevates the ATIA above ordinary stat-&#13;

    Leadership at the top of individual institutions   â&#128;¢ providing adequate authority and re-&#13;

reported that staff attitudes toward compli-             charge of access decision making;&#13;

leadership made it clear that nothing less               training and development opportunities&#13;

would be tolerated. Support from senior                â&#128;¢ recognizing and rewarding their contri-&#13;

    Fifth, we learn that rapid turnover in the&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;About the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice&#13;
Governance is one of seven priority themes in the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s recently launched renewal strate-&#13;
gyâ&#128;&#148;a strategy that responds to client demand for peer-to-peer learning by grounding WBIâ&#128;&#153;s work in the dis-&#13;
tillation and dissemination of practitioner experiences. The Institute is committed to building knowledge and&#13;
capacity on the â&#128;&#156;how toâ&#128;&#157; of governance reforms, with emphasis on supporting and sustaining multistake-&#13;
holder engagement in bringing about such reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WBIâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice works with partners, including networks of country and regional institutions, to&#13;
develop and replicate customized learning programs. Its programmatic approach aims at building multistake-&#13;
holder coalitions and in creating collaborative platforms and peer networks for knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
The Practice focuses on three thematic areas: governance of extractive industries, procurement reform, and&#13;
access to information. A fourth program supports anti-corruption programs for Parliamentarians, the Judiciary&#13;
and the Private Sector. A Mobilizing Stakeholders for Reform group links stakeholder groups in support of&#13;
these priority areas, documents and codifies knowledge, and builds capacity in cross-cutting areas. And last-&#13;
lyâ&#128;&#148;but importantlyâ&#128;&#148;a Leadership Development Program focuses on strengthening the capacity of potential&#13;
leaders to harness the energies of stakeholder groups and to and channel these efforts toward reform.&#13;

            Advancing access to information principles
            through performance management mechanisms : the case of Canada
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            On the basis of a detailed case study of
            the government of Canada, this report examines how
            management accountability processes operating within public
            services may contribute to the promotion and enforcement of
            access laws. Canada’s access to information act (ATIA) came
            into force in 1983. In 2003, the central management
            department in the public service, the Treasury Board
            Secretariat, adopted the management accountability framework
            (MAF) to provide a consolidated basis for an annual
            appraisal of the management of departments and agencies and
            of the senior public servants who manage them. The report
            examines the intersection of the ATIA and the MAF to
            determine whether adding an access component to the internal
            management accountability processes has improved commitment
            to and compliance with Canada’s access law. Moving beyond
            legislation, government application of the law, and court
            interpretations, the case study uses elite interviews,
            official documents, online sources, and the available
            secondary literature to identify the multiple institutions
            and actors, their divergent interests and perspectives, and
            the formal and informal processes that shape how the ATIA
            and MAF processes work in practice. The study notes that
            access matters were given limited recognition in the design
            of the MAF and have received limited attention in the actual
            processes of appraising the performance of departments and
            agencies and senior public servants who lead and manage
            them. The conclusion is that including access in Canada’s
            MAF cannot completely counter internal and external
            developments and pressures pushing toward stricter control
            over information flows.
