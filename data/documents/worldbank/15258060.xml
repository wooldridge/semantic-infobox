Global Scaling Up Handwashing is a Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) project focused on learning&#13;
how to apply innovative promotional approaches to behavior change to generate widespread and&#13;
sustained improvements in handwashing with soap at scale among women of reproductive age&#13;
(ages 15-49) and primary school-aged children (ages 5-9). The project is being implemented by&#13;
local and national governments with technical support from WSP. For more information, please visit&#13;

     WSP developed HWI as a behavior-change package, with                   literature and a discussion with experienced subject matter&#13;

&#13;
In 2010, WSP hired an international consultant to conduct                    regional levels, although there remain some general threats,&#13;
an endline assessment of the same dimensions. This assess-                   and the EE is not as strong in some regions as in others.&#13;
ment aimed to evaluate the robustness of the programmatic&#13;
conditions for scale-up and sustainability as the projectâ&#128;&#153;s                  Likelihood that HWI interventions will continue to&#13;
implementation phase was winding down. The objectives                        be implemented at a large scale: This is highly likely in&#13;
for the assessment included:                                                 many regions. In addition to focusing on (1) integration of&#13;

   ponent of PIN (Integrated Nutrition Program). In July 2010, a proposal to institutionalize the HWI methodology in&#13;
   all MIMDES programs arrived at the desk of the Vice Minister for Social Development. At the time of this evalua-&#13;
   tion, PRONAA, Wawa Wasi, and FONCODES were preparing pilot projects under the public investment structure&#13;
   to integrate the HWI approach and methodologies. PRONAA is expected to incorporate handwashing with soap&#13;
   in mobilization events around in food distribution program in Ancash, Lima and Amazonas. In 2010, MIMDES&#13;
   zonal managers from 19 (of 25) regions were trained in the HWI methodology. MIMDES purchased 9,600 hygiene&#13;
   kits for classrooms. PRONAA developed various print materials, including a calendar, a flip chart and a poster,&#13;

        The spider uses categorical scales for each dimension. Each scale represents a dimension and each point on the scale ( 0-5) has defined indicators. Achievement of an&#13;
        indicator is binaryâ&#128;&#148;either it has been achieved or not. EE progress should not be considered linear, as scales may be achieved out of the order listed. For this reason, EE&#13;
        scores are cumulative and not sequential.&#13;

Second, the MOH is leading a group, which includes the MOE and MIMDES,&#13;
that has almost completed a booklet for mayors to explain HWI, its activities,&#13;
costs, etc. The MOE and Ministry of Environment produced national guidelines&#13;
for teachers on environmental education that include HWIâ&#128;&#153;s training methodol-&#13;
ogy for behavioral change&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the initial enabling environment assessment conducted in May&#13;
2007 and annual updates on scores for each of the nine dimensions, HWI under-&#13;
took 18 regional assessments of scalability and sustainability in 2008. These were&#13;
used as a baseline.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, from the beginning, the Peru team established several objectives related to&#13;
sustainability: (1) To become part of national, regional and local policies related&#13;
to health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation (2) to institutionalize&#13;
the behavior-change methodologies and tools in these sectors; and (3) to insert&#13;
handwashing behavioral change approach and methodologies into the MEFâ&#128;&#153;s na-&#13;
tional budget. The first two objectives have been largely achieved. The last one is&#13;
still in process.&#13;

            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            is in the final phase of the Global Scaling up Hand washing
            Project, implemented in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and
            Vietnam. In Peru, where the project is known as Iniciativa
            de Lavado de Manos, or the Hand washing Initiative (HWI),
            the specific target is to reach 5.1 million women and
            children under the age of 12 with hand washing messages by
            the end of the four-year implementation period (November
            2010). The ultimate goal is to have 1.3 million people
            practicing improved hand washing behaviors. This report
            summarizes the end line assessment of the enabling
            environment (EE) for the Global Scaling up Hand washing
            Project in Peru. This assessment aimed to evaluate the
            robustness of the programmatic conditions for scale up and
            sustainability as the project's implementation phase
            was winding down. Research carried out from October 18 to
            November 5, 2010, followed a 2007 baseline EE assessment.
            The same instrument was used in both assessments, with some
            modifications and additions made in 2010 based on program
            experience and learning. An international consultant carried
            out the assessment.
