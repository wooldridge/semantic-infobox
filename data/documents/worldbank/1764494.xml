Conclusion&#13;
Firms have a strong incentive to engage in abuses&#13;
in the sale of automotive fuels because of con-&#13;
sumers' difficulty in detecting the abuses and&#13;
because of the potential for substantial profit.&#13;
Besides imposing direct costs on the buyers, many&#13;
of these practices have external costs. Controlling&#13;
the abuses requires an enforcement regime&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In the fuel business, smuggling,
            adulteration, mislabeling, and short-weighting are
            widespread in many developing counties. Not only do these
            commercial abuses reduce consumer welfare and government
            excise revenue but the combustion of substandard fuels can
            have a serious public health impact. This Note looks at how
            the structure of the fuel industry affects incentives for
            such abuses and shows how some developing countries have
            worked to combat the practices.
