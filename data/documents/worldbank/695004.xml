1. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   With a 1995 population of about 10.25 million and an estimated GNP per capita of&#13;
US$260, Cambodia is one of the world's poorest nations. In stark contrast to some of its South&#13;
East Asian neighbors with dynamic and fast growing economies, the country is still recovering&#13;
from 25 years of war and isolation, during which much of its physical, social and economic&#13;
infrastructure was destroyed. Following a period of almost exclusive assistance from the former&#13;
Communist Bloc (1979-1988), the Paris Peace Accords of October 1991 opened up the country&#13;
to wider rehabilitation assistance by bilateral and multilateral donors as well as international&#13;
NGOs. The Paris Accords also paved the way for national elections held under the aegis of the&#13;
United Nations Transitional Authority of Cambodia (UNTAC), culminating in the formation of a&#13;
coalition Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) at the end of October 1993.&#13;
1.2   The new Government has embarked, with the support of the international community, on&#13;
a comprehensive medium-term program of macroeconomic stabilization that would help&#13;
Cambodia successfully complete its recent re-orientation towards a free market economy. Major&#13;
policy interventions have been directed at bringing down the budget deficit and rate of inflation,&#13;
at raising tax revenues and improving tax administration, and reforming the monetary sector. The&#13;
tighter financial policies have started to yield results, notably with the rate of inflation falling to&#13;
an estimated 3.5 percent in 1995 as compared to triple-digit figures in 1992-93.&#13;
1.3  In fact, successful long-term development of agriculture will be crucial in helping&#13;
Cambodia to meet the numerous challenges that it faces. Amongst these are the need to feed a&#13;
population that, at its present growth rate of about 3% p.a., will double in 25 years, and to&#13;
contain unsupportable urban migration by creating opportunities of productive employment in&#13;
the rural economy for a young and growing population (about half are under 15 years of age). A&#13;
critical challenge is therefore to rebuild the Government's capacity to plan, formulate and&#13;
execute agriculture and rural development programs.&#13;
B. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
1.4   Most Cambodian households depend on agriculture and its related subsectors of livestock&#13;
rearing, fisheries and forest exploitation for their living. There are estimated to be about 1 million&#13;
farming households of which a substantial minority, perhaps as high as 35 percent, is headed by&#13;
women without access to adult male labor. Agriculture constitutes half of Cambodia's GDP and&#13;
involves about 80% of the labor force. Crops, grown both for food and for other products such as&#13;
rubber, account for roughly 30% of GDP, livestock raising for another 15%, fishing for an&#13;
estimated 4 to 5%, and forestry for I to 2%. Rice is the most important crop, accounting for one-&#13;
third of the total estimated value of agricultural production; rice, vegetables, fish and some meat&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
are the staples of the Cambodian diet. Rubber and timber are the country's most important export&#13;
commodities, recently comprising 75% of total domestic exports; but small quantities of other&#13;
agricultural products, including live cattle, rice, fruits and fish, are also traded to neighboring&#13;
countries, which represent important markets for future development of the sector.&#13;
1.5    Agriculture research, planning and development, including that of the livestock, forestry&#13;
and fishery subsectors, as well as management of water resources for all agricultural uses, is&#13;
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry &amp; Fisheries (MAFF) which is&#13;
organized on the basis of seven technical departments which control their own staff in the&#13;
provinces, with a total of about 12,000 employees. Although many of these staff have useful&#13;
training and work experience from earlier years, the Ministry does not presently have the budget&#13;
or responsibility for implementing major projects, apart from irrigation rehabilitation works&#13;
funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under its Special Rehabilitation Assistance Loan.&#13;
All agricultural research is presently being done under externally funded projects, for rice&#13;
notably by IRRI under a project funded by Australia. France plans to support the re-&#13;
establishment of a research institute for rubber (IRCC). Responsibility for coordinating rural&#13;
development activities lies with the Ministry of Rural Development, which now has about 1,200&#13;
employees and is involved in organizing rural water supply, rural roads, rural credit, village&#13;
health and community development programs, often in collaboration with projects started by&#13;
NGOs and international organizations. Important decisions by the Government affecting the&#13;
relative roles and responsibilities of these and other agencies operating in the rural sector are&#13;
increasingly being taken by a Coordinating Committee for Agriculture &amp; Rural Development&#13;
(CCARD) on which all agencies concerned are represented under the chairmanship of the Second&#13;
Prime Minister. The CCARD is likely to be the Government's overall coordinating body for this&#13;
and future Bank-supported projects for agriculture and rural development. Coordination of&#13;
activities at provincial level is increasingly provided through Provincial Rural Development&#13;
Committees (PRDC), chaired by the Provincial Governors.&#13;
1.6    Although agricultural production recovered quite strongly over the last decade,&#13;
productivity levels are still low compared with those in other countries in the region, indicating&#13;
that opportunities for raising them through improved technology and other means should be&#13;
substantial. However, there are important constraints on how quickly this can be achieved,&#13;
relating to technical, economic and socio-political factors. Yield of main crops, especially rice, is&#13;
quite varied between different agro-ecological zones and very unpredictable from one season to&#13;
the next, dependent on climatic events. In both 1994 and 1996, extensive flooding resulted in&#13;
considerable crop damage, amounting to about 15% of the normal expected crop. Above-average&#13;
rice production in 1995/96, which permitted limited rice exports to be resumed, was attributable&#13;
to favorable rainfall, an increase in the use of inorganic fertilizers and a restoration of natural soil&#13;
fertility as a result of flooding of the central plains the previous year. Consequently, year-to-year&#13;
fluctuations in rice supply are likely to recur.&#13;
1.7   This yield uncertainty is the result of many factors, including a low proportion of cropped&#13;
area under irrigation, difficulties in achieving satisfactory water control on often poorly&#13;
engineered irrigation schemes, unusually variable soil conditions, and restricted availability of&#13;
modem technology inputs that could potentially reduce crop losses from drought, pest and&#13;
&#13;

NGOs and international organizations. Important decisions by the Government affecting the&#13;
relative roles and responsibilities of these and other agencies operating in the rural sector are&#13;
increasingly being taken by a Coordinating Committee for Agriculture &amp; Rural Development&#13;
(CCARD) on which all agencies concerned are represented under the chairmanship of the Second&#13;
Prime Minister. The CCARD is likely to be the Government's overall coordinating body for this&#13;
and future Bank-supported projects for agriculture and rural development. Coordination of&#13;
activities at provincial level is increasingly provided through Provincial Rural Development&#13;
Committees (PRDC), chaired by the Provincial Governors.&#13;
1.6     Although agricultural production recovered quite strongly over the last decade,&#13;
productivity levels are still low compared with those in other countries in the region, indicating&#13;
that opportunities for raising them through improved technology and other means should be&#13;
substantial. However, there are important constraints on how quickly this can be achieved,&#13;
relating to technical, economic and socio-political factors. Yield of main crops, especially rice, is&#13;
quite varied between different agro-ecological zones and very unpredictable from one season to&#13;
the next, dependent on climatic events. In both 1994 and 1996, extensive flooding resulted in&#13;
considerable crop damage, amounting to about 15% of the normal expected crop. Above-average&#13;
rice production in 1995/96, which permitted limited rice exports to be resumed, was attributable&#13;
to favorable rainfall, an increase in the use of inorganic fertilizers and a restoration of natural soil&#13;
fertility as a result of flooding of the central plains the previous year. Consequently, year-to-year&#13;
fluctuations in rice supply are likely to recur.&#13;
1.7   This yield uncertainty is the result of many factors, including a low proportion of cropped&#13;
area under irrigation, difficulties in achieving satisfactory water control on often poorly&#13;
engineered irrigation schemes, unusually variable soil conditions, and restricted availability of&#13;
modern technology inputs that could potentially reduce crop losses from drought, pest and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
disease. The three decades of civil war have destroyed vital data and the technical knowledge&#13;
needed to use these data, severely depleted the agricultural labor force, leaving many women&#13;
with the responsibility of farm as well as household management, and displaced rural families&#13;
from their original land holdings. Poor transport and communications and continuing insecurity&#13;
in parts of the country only aggravate the problem by making it more costly for farmers and&#13;
traders to move surplus product and other supplies from one area to another.&#13;
1.8   Constraints on agricultural productivity, including low resiliency of production systems&#13;
to flooding, drought, pest and disease, result in regional and localized shortfalls in supplying the&#13;
minimum nutritional needs of rural residents for rice and other basic foods. Reaching national&#13;
self-sufficiency in rice production has remained elusive, necessitating an unsustainable reliance&#13;
on external food aid. The high cost of transporting rice and other foods, along with the inability&#13;
of poorer residents to pay, means that even if aggregate production is sufficient for national&#13;
needs, pockets of the rural poor go hungry. With the system of collectivized agriculture officially&#13;
dissolved in 1989 and land privatization given legal backing in 1991, public supports (including&#13;
provision of agricultural inputs, basic commodity distribution, and price setting) have been&#13;
progressively removed. The impact of these changes is uneven, likely contributing to an increase&#13;
in agricultural production, but also placing disproportionate strain on vulnerable groups&#13;
including recent returnees, internally displaced persons, landless and land-poor rural residents,&#13;
and rural households, such as those headed by widows, lacking in family labor. In general, these&#13;
are the groups put at greatest risk in times of local food shortage.&#13;
1.9   Rice, which supplies about 75% of the calories consumed by Cambodians, is grown on&#13;
over 90% of the currently cropped area. In 1989-91 Cambodia was considered close to food self-&#13;
sufficiency, producing an annual average of some 2.5 million tons of paddy. The droughts and&#13;
flooding that have damaged rice crops in parts of the country each year since 1990, however,&#13;
have partly frustrated the attempts to increase aggregate rice production, while mines and&#13;
insecurity problems have kept farmers away from otherwise cultivable areas. Due to the refugee&#13;
repatriation and an estimated population growth rate of 2.7% per annum, paddy production&#13;
would need to reach approximately 3.0 million tons by 2000 to assure national self sufficiency&#13;
(based on FAO minimum nutritional requirements).&#13;
1.10  Moreover, even if overall rice production is adequate at a national or regional level,&#13;
constraints on the transport and marketing of rice and other basic foods still pose significant&#13;
obstacles to achieving household food security. In the past, heavy government regulation could&#13;
be blamed as the main impediment to output growth. In the mid 1980s, controls on rural mobility&#13;
and restrictions on private trade were significant, but the market liberalizing reforms introduced&#13;
since 1989 removed most such regulatory constraints. More recently, a ban on rice exports&#13;
limited the potential of farmers to increase incomes through access to the export market. The&#13;
Government agreed to lift the ban on rice exports in late 1994, but delayed the official lifting&#13;
until late 1995 because of the poor 1994/95 rice harvest. The Government's commitment to an&#13;
open export policy for rice is important in signaling to farmers that investments in increasing&#13;
domestic food production are worthwhile. National food security is not put at risk with such a&#13;
policy because of Cambodia's proximity to two major rice exporters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
1.11  Beyond the need for clear policy signals, two factors stand out as pressing constraints on&#13;
agricultural marketing. First is the poor state of transport infrastructure that makes distributing&#13;
the stocks to rural areas experiencing a rice deficit very costly. Second is the widespread practice&#13;
of illegal road "taxation," whereby various groups levy a toll on road users. WFP reports that,&#13;
though rice remained available in Phnom Penh and province centers in 1995, villages outside a&#13;
15-20 kilometer radius generally did not have access to these supplies in times of local shortage.&#13;
This is partly due to the high transaction costs in food transport.&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.12  In its presentations to the CG meeting held in July 1996, the Cambodian Government has&#13;
made clear the top priority given in its development strategy to achieving early and sustainable&#13;
improvements in agricultural production and poverty reduction in the rural areas. Furthermore, in&#13;
the context of its efforts to reinforce the political basis for national reconciliation, the two Prime&#13;
Ministers have repeatedly stressed the urgency of formulating and implementing sound projects&#13;
for agriculture and rural development, as the principal means to bring about peace and security in&#13;
the countryside. The Bank's assistance program fully reflects this priority, and the design of the&#13;
proposed project responds to the strategic objectives set out in the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
dated January 28, 1997 and scheduled for Board discussion on February 20, 1997. Specifically&#13;
the project supports the strategic objectives of "enhancing rural development and natural&#13;
resource management" and "improving the human resource base and reducing poverty" (draft&#13;
CAS, paras. 39 and 42). Complementing the proposed project, identification has taken place of a&#13;
possible IDA-financed Rural Development Project for FY98/99, with components for rural&#13;
transport and water supply improvement, agricultural and other income-generating activities, and&#13;
institutional strengthening at local levels in four northeastern provinces, which would build upon&#13;
the agricultural field development programs to be started under APIP. Clarification of the policy&#13;
and institutional framework for both of these projects has been assisted by discussion with&#13;
Government and other agencies of an Agriculture Sector Memorandum.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.13  The Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP), Credit 2550-KH, was approved in&#13;
November 1993 and is now closed. The major part of the US$63 million equivalent Credit&#13;
financed critical imports needed by the private sector, while the rest financed the foreign&#13;
exchange costs of rehabilitation sub-projects in six sectors. Following a mid-term review in&#13;
October 1994, the amount earmarked for agriculture (and some other sectors) was reduced, both&#13;
because of a lack of well prepared rehabilitation projects, and because of a pressing need to&#13;
reallocate funds to investments in the power sector and for general imports. The restructuring of&#13;
the agriculture component resulted in the elimination of several sub-projects whose technical&#13;
feasibility or implementation within the agreed time-frame looked uncertain. As a result of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
restructuring, successful implementation of ERP agriculture subcomponents has helped pave the&#13;
way for some of the components of the proposed project.'&#13;
1.14 The main lessons learned from implementing the agriculture component of the ERP are:&#13;
(i) in Cambodia's present transitional stage of development, the Government's absorptive&#13;
capacity for planning and implementing projects is still very limited and needs to be&#13;
supplemented for an interim period with technical assistance; (ii) at the same time, the risk of&#13;
creating a long-term dependency on foreign technical assistance should be avoided by involving&#13;
local staff in project design and implementation at an early stage, improving incentives for&#13;
initiative and performance, and providing more relevant and better organized training; (iii)&#13;
project design and management arrangements should be kept simple in terms of their demands on&#13;
central government coordination and implementation capacity, with attention also paid to&#13;
decentralizing responsibility for implementation to the provincial levels; and (iv) despite efforts&#13;
being made in the Finance Ministry to overhaul the budgetary system, systems for making timely&#13;
transfer of funds to the line departments and provinces remain weak and will require continued&#13;
attention.&#13;
The components concerned are those for agronomy, livestock, fisheries, agricultural hydraulics, and&#13;
smaliholder rubber.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
2.1   Most of the cost of project preparation was covered by a grant from the Japan Policy and&#13;
Human Resource Development Fund of Yen 42.4 million (US$0.4 million equivalent), of which&#13;
approximately half was used to finance agronomy, irrigation, fisheries, sociology and agricultural&#13;
economics specialists for the preparation of this project and for pre-implementation assistance to&#13;
the MAFF; the balance is being used for preparation of a rural development project under the&#13;
aegis of the MRD. At the request of the Government of Cambodia, trust funds for project&#13;
preparation were administered by the Bank. The Swedish SIDA trust fund financed a veterinarian&#13;
who helped to update and expand the livestock component prepared by IFAD in 1994. The&#13;
French general consultant trust fund financed a research agronomist from CIRAD who&#13;
contributed to the preparation of the agronomy component. CIRAD also prepared the&#13;
smallholder rubber research component. FAO and IDRC (Canada) helped prepare the IPM and&#13;
fisheries components. FAO prepared the agricultural statistics component; and the FAO&#13;
Cooperative Programme provided a seeds industry specialist for preparation of the seeds&#13;
production component. Bank missions and MAFF staff worked together closely throughout&#13;
project preparation to incorporate the above contributions into the final project design.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.2   The project's overall objective, in line with the major goals of government policy in the&#13;
sector, is the sustainable and broad-based improvement of smallholder agricultural productivity&#13;
as a means to improved food security and increased rural incomes. In the longer term, the&#13;
agricultural sector is also expected to earn needed foreign exchange through exported surpluses,&#13;
save foreign exchange through import substitution, and contribute government revenue to cover&#13;
investment and recurrent costs of providing public services to the sector. This goal recognises: (i)&#13;
Cambodia's commitment to a market-based economic development strategy; (ii) that aggregate&#13;
agricultural production is a function of decisions made by individual farmers, who already invest&#13;
their own resources in agricultural production at high risk and for low returns (crop losses, crop&#13;
failure, livestock disease/mortality, civil insecurity, unknown markets); and (iii) that reduced&#13;
risks and increased returns could be assisted though improved farmer access to information,&#13;
appropriate technology, inputs and markets.&#13;
2.3   The project's underlying premise is that MAFF has, and will continue to have, an&#13;
important responsibility to the 80% of Cambodia's population who derive their livelihood from&#13;
agriculture, which at present MAFF does not have the capacity to fulfil. As defined in MAFF's&#13;
draft mission statement, its role is "to support the economic growth of Cambodia by provising&#13;
high quality services which result in a secure food supply, increased agricultural output and add&#13;
value on a sustainable and cost effective basis to the agricultural, fishing and forest based&#13;
sectors". The project would help to build the necessary institutional capacity in MAFF, in part by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementing pilot field programs as a means of (i) gaining experience in the planning,&#13;
organization and management of agricultural development programs; (ii) adapting, testing and&#13;
demonstrating improved agricultural technology under field conditions; and (iii) more generally&#13;
developing MAFF's understanding of and responsiveness to the needs of its client base.&#13;
2.4   The project would promote sustainable agricultural development by creating a MAFF that&#13;
is enabling, responsive, accountable and cost effective. MAFF's evolving role and responsibility&#13;
within a market-based economy will be to:&#13;
(a)   create an environment wherein smallholder farmers, who are predominantly poor&#13;
and largely excluded from the market economy, can gain access to basic&#13;
agricultural services and the opportunity to use new technology;&#13;
(b)   adapt, test, and demonstrate new technology appropriate to the country's different&#13;
agro-ecological zones, which responds to local priorities and is economically&#13;
beneficial to farmers;&#13;
(c)   regulate farming practices so as to ensure sustainability of natural resources and to&#13;
protect the health and welfare of the rural population;&#13;
(d)   provide public, and some private, goods and services used by the agricultural&#13;
sector (e.g. annual stocks of rice foundation seed) on a cost recovery basis;&#13;
(e)   license and regulate the provision of private goods and services (such as crop&#13;
inputs, veterinary services and water) so that consumer and farmer interests are&#13;
appropriately safeguarded.&#13;
2.5   Recognizing the above, the proposed project would consist of a coordinated five-year&#13;
program to improve the quantity and quality of the technical, human and physical resources of&#13;
MAFF needed to promote sustainable agricultural development. This would be achieved through&#13;
carrying out (i) programs in each of the main agricultural subsectors comprising essential&#13;
knowledge acquisition, technology testing and adaptation, field development activities, priority&#13;
rehabilitation investments, and (ii) a major effort in MAFF human resource development. The&#13;
sum total of these activities should lead by project completion to the building of substantial&#13;
capacity in MAFF to plan, coordinate and implement successful agricultural development&#13;
programs for the benefit of and with the participation of the rural populations concerned, and to&#13;
substantial benefits for farmers in the areas of the pilot field programs in terms of increased crop&#13;
and livestock production (see para. 2.14 for expected project outputs). The project design is&#13;
sufficiently flexible and comprehensive to provide a framework capable of absorbing technical&#13;
assistance and other interventions for institutional strengthening of MAFF which may be&#13;
provided by other donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.6   The project would comprise nine components addressing priority development needs of&#13;
2&#13;
the MAFF. Five components would be carried out by MAFF technical departments , and three&#13;
would be implemented from the Ministry level -- for strengthening agricultural planning and&#13;
statistics, for establishing a human resource management capability, and for strengthening of&#13;
provincial agriculture services. The other component would be the establishment of a project&#13;
management unit (PMU) within the Ministry to manage the project. Organization of the&#13;
components by responsible department was adopted to facilitate preparation and management of&#13;
the project; there would, however, be substantial collaboration fostered between the departments,&#13;
both at headquarters and especially in the field, in implementing the project. The individual&#13;
components are described below.&#13;
Agronomy, Seeds and Plant Protection&#13;
2.7   This is the largest and most important of the Project's components, accounting for 29% of&#13;
total costs. It aims at strengthening the capacity of the Department of Agronomy (DOA) to&#13;
develop appropriate technologies and formulate technical recommendations to farmers for&#13;
improving rice and other annual crop production, with a view to achieving greater food security&#13;
and increased farmer incomes while ensuring sustainability of farming practices. The component&#13;
does not seek to develop DOA's capacity to undertake research per se, but rather to fill the&#13;
critical gap between research and extension. It aims to provide DOA with the capacity to: (i)&#13;
coordinate agricultural research effectively, to ensure that research programs on crop technology&#13;
are formulated in accordance with the country's priorities; (ii) collect and analyze regional and&#13;
local data on the main factors of production, with a view to identifying constraints and&#13;
improving the base of technical knowledge that supports agricultural policy making; (iii) test&#13;
technologies developed by research with a view to formulating suitable recommendations to&#13;
farmers; (iv) lay the basis for modem seed industry in Cambodia capable of supplying farmers&#13;
with higher yielding and better quality seed for rice and other food crops; (v) promote&#13;
appropriate farming practices to ensure the sustainability of natural resources and protect the&#13;
natural environment and the health of farming families from the increasing use of dangerous&#13;
pesticides by educating them in IPM and other safer methods of pest control; and (vi) provide&#13;
technical support to agricultural extension workers and staff of the provincial agriculture&#13;
services.&#13;
2.8   The DOA component would consist of: (a) a Technical Coordination and Capacity&#13;
Building sub-component (US$1 .5m) and five technical sub-components: (b) Soil Fertility&#13;
Management and Conservation (US$1.0 m); (c) Farming Systems and Crop Diversification&#13;
(US$0.9 m); (d) Seed Production Program (US$3.5m); (e) Plant Protection Service&#13;
Establishment (US$1.lm); and (f) Integrated Pest Management (US$1.5 m). Each sub-&#13;
component would receive technical assistance support and the necessary funding for training&#13;
national staff, supplying equipment, construction or rehabilitation of selected infrastructure and&#13;
2  In this report the term "departments" also includes the Ministry's two General Directorates (Directions&#13;
Generales) for Irrigation and Hydro-Meteorology (GDIHM) and Rubber Production (DGPH).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
incremental operating expenditures. Long term TA (one expert each for up to five years) for&#13;
subcomponents (c) and (f) would be provided respectively by CIRAD (France) and the FAO&#13;
regional IPM unit based in Manila; their costs are not included in the project.&#13;
Animal Health and Production.&#13;
2.9   All types of livestock in Cambodia suffer from very high morbidity and mortality rates,&#13;
due to the inability of Government services or the private sector to deliver basic animal health&#13;
services, for which there exists cost-effective technology and demand from farmers. This&#13;
component of the project, to be implemented by the Department of Animal Health and&#13;
Production (DAHP), would build on the experience of successful NGO livestock programs and a&#13;
pilot scheme started under the Bank ERP. There would be three subcomponents: (a) Disease&#13;
Control and Management ($2.5 m) which would improve the DAHP central support services for&#13;
animal disease diagnosis and vaccine production; (b) a Basic Animal Health program in four&#13;
provinces where livestock raising is particularly important for the local economy ($2.2 m); and&#13;
(c) Promotion of Animal Production through an extension program for improved animal&#13;
husbandry and nutrition ($0.2 m). Because subcomponent (b) depends on the successful&#13;
introduction in four provinces of a system of privatized village vets to provide basic animal&#13;
health services to farmers, with training and initial support from DAHP, it was agreed during&#13;
negotiations that by December 31, 1997 the Government would adopt a national plan for&#13;
training, registration and licensing of village vets satisfactory to IFAD and the Association. The&#13;
base cost of the component as a whole, which would be financed in parallel by IFAD, is&#13;
estimated at $4.9 million (15% of total costs).&#13;
Agricultural Hydraulics&#13;
2.10  The agricultural hydraulics component of the project is intended to provide the General&#13;
Department of Irrigation, Hydrology &amp; Meteorology (GDIHM) with the basic skills, knowledge&#13;
and equipment to function effectively not only as the MAFF department with the responsibility&#13;
for managing water for all agricultural uses but also as the only government agency currently&#13;
with the mandate to plan the use of water resources across sectoral and local boundaries. The&#13;
component would consist of four subcomponents: (a) GDIHM Capacity Building ($0.7m); (b)&#13;
Hydrology Information System Development ($1.0m); (c) Small Scale Agricultural Hydraulics&#13;
($2.7m); and (d) Medium Scale Agricultural Hydraulics ($0.9m). The four subcomponents are&#13;
designed with two complementary objectives in mind: to help strengthen the technical, human&#13;
and physical resources of the GDIHM; and to improve farmer incomes and food security in&#13;
selected pilot provinces through provision of water for supplementary irrigation as well as&#13;
fishing, livestock and domestic use.&#13;
Fisheries&#13;
2.11  The overall objective of this component, to be implemented by the Department of&#13;
Fisheries (DOF), is to help improve Cambodians' livelihood and nutrition by sustaining the yield&#13;
of freshwater fisheries through better management of the capture fishery and increasing the&#13;
production of fingerlings for fish rearing. The specific objectives are to: improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
conservation and management of the capture fisheries, with a focus on freshwater fisheries;&#13;
improve the supply of seed for aquaculture, with a focus on indigenous fish species; and&#13;
strengthen the Department of Fisheries to carry out its mandate. There would be three&#13;
subcomponents: (a) fisheries conservation and management ($1.5 m), comprising demarcation of&#13;
fish sanctuaries in the Tonle Sap, habitat improvement, equipping the DOF fisheries inspection&#13;
units for more effective regulation enforcement, and related information and training activities;&#13;
(b) rehabilitation of a freshwater fisheries research station at Chriang Chamres on the Tonle Sap&#13;
River in order to improve the production and supply of fingerlings of indigenous species for local&#13;
fish raising enterprises ($1.0 m); and (c) DOF capacity building, for which training and short&#13;
term technical assistance would be supplied in policy, finance and administration, human&#13;
resource development, fisheries law and statistics ($0.5 m). It is expected that long term technical&#13;
assistance to the DOF to assist it in carrying out subcomponent (a) will be provided under an&#13;
extension of an ongoing DANIDA/MRC project for management of the freshwater capture&#13;
fisheries of Cambodia.&#13;
Smallholder Rubber Research&#13;
2.12 The component, to be implemented by the Department of Rubber Production (DGPH), is&#13;
designed to obtain the technical data needed to confirm the country's suitability for smallholder&#13;
rubber development, through formulation and implementation of a smallholder rubber research&#13;
program and training of national research scientists and technicians. The project would comprise&#13;
technical assistance of a senior rubber research specialist for five years (to be provided and&#13;
funded by CIRAD, France), vehicles, office and laboratory equipment, and related incremental&#13;
operating expenses. Total costs are estimated at $1.7 million.&#13;
MAFF Strengthening Components&#13;
2.13  Three components are situated organizationally at Ministry level:&#13;
(a)   Human Resource Management (HRM): technical assistance would be provided to&#13;
establish and train a Human Resource Management Unit attached to the&#13;
Department of Personnel which would establish a MAFF personnel data base,&#13;
train HRD managers in the MAFF and departmental personnel departments, carry&#13;
out organizational and job analyses, carry out training needs assessments, prepare&#13;
training plans for each department and unit of the Ministry involved in the project,&#13;
and manage the selection, evaluation and career development of staff selected into&#13;
project positions. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government would&#13;
prepare and send for IDA's comments the annual training programs to be carried&#13;
out under the Project. This work would provide the information and in-house&#13;
skills needed to support the ongoing reorganization of the Ministry as well as an&#13;
expansion and more effective use of training. The cost is estimated at $1.7&#13;
million;&#13;
(b)   Support to Provincial Departments of Agriculture: the component would provide&#13;
for rehabilitation of buildings, office equipment, training, workshops and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
incremental operating expenses for five MAFF provincial offices 3 to support the&#13;
project's field activities. The cost is estimated at $0.4 million; and&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of Planning and Statistics. These two subcomponents, to be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry's Department of Planning, Statistics &amp; International&#13;
Cooperation (DPSIC) would provide technical assistance (short and long term),&#13;
staff training (local and overseas), vehicles, equipment and operating budgets&#13;
needed to build the capacity of the planning and statistics offices of DPSIC to&#13;
strengthen the Ministry's capacity to carry out project and program level publik&#13;
investment planning and to better meet the country's needs for basic agricultural&#13;
statistics. Total costs are estimated at $2.9 million.&#13;
Project Management Unit&#13;
2.14   To assist in implementation of the project and training of local staff a Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) would be established within MAFF, reporting to the Secretary of State&#13;
for Agriculture, who would chair a Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PMU would be&#13;
headed by a senior official, of the level of Under Secretary of State, and be staffed by a full-time&#13;
Deputy Chief and other staff, supported by long and short term technical assistance, including a&#13;
Project Management Advisor, who would be the chief technical advisor for the Project; a&#13;
Procurement Specialist; a Finance &amp; Administration Specialist; and short term consultants for&#13;
establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems and supervision of buildings and civil&#13;
works. The PMU would coordinate the budgets and implementation plans of all the components&#13;
of the project, and ensure their appropriate auditing, monitoring, evaluation and progress&#13;
reporting. The estimated cost of the PMU, including costs for a staff retraining program, is $3.0&#13;
million over five years, or about 9% of the base cost estimate. It was agreed that both PSC and&#13;
PMU would have been established, according to terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, and their&#13;
key personnel appointed, as conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
D. EXPECTED OUTPUTS&#13;
2.15  The project would enable activities to be undertaken as part of coherent work programs in&#13;
five key sub-sectors 5 to produce outputs needed to achieve the project's medium term capacity-&#13;
building objective. Directly productive outputs in terms of increased agricultural production and&#13;
rural income would also be achieved during the Project.&#13;
2.16 Human Resources. By project completion, a key output in all sub-sectors would be&#13;
developed human resources. In MAFF, about 1,000 trained personnel at central and provincial&#13;
levels would have achieved pre-determined levels of technical and managerial competency.&#13;
Kompong Thom, Kompong Cham, Kratie, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng provinces; see map IBRD 27954.&#13;
4   including crop production estimates at district, provincial and national level, and monitoring and analysis of&#13;
producer price developments&#13;
5   Agronomy, livestock, fisheries, agricultural hydraulics, and smallholder rubber.&#13;
6   (of a total MAFF workforce of about 12,500)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Many more would have acquired better communication and analytical skills and gained on-the-&#13;
job experience of successful workplan implementation and inter-departmental collaboration.&#13;
Training courses would have been conducted for staff of the agronomy, livestock and hydrology&#13;
departments in gender awareness. In four selected provinces about 800 village vets would be&#13;
trained and licensed; and about 20,000 farmers trained / exposed to new technology: 16,000 rice&#13;
farmers would have been trained in IPM; a minimum of 500 farmers trained in seed production,&#13;
and about 2,000 farmers would have participated in supervised on-farm field trials (200 trials per&#13;
year for 4 years in Soil Fertility Management and Farming Systems/Crop Diversification).&#13;
2.17 Physical Outputs. Expected physical outputs contributing to the institutional capacity&#13;
objective include newly constructed or rehabilitated and equipped departmental and provincial&#13;
offices, laboratories, research station and seed processing buildings; it is expected that these&#13;
would be functioning efficiently.&#13;
2.18   The Seeds Multiplication Program would start to produce physical outputs within the&#13;
investment period of the project, including 700 tons/year of improved rice foundation seed&#13;
produced for multiplication and 15,000 tons/year of rice extension seed processed, labelled and&#13;
marketed. Other directly productive outputs are 2 million/year doses of cattle vaccine, 2&#13;
million/year fish fry/fingerlings, and about 136 small-scale water retention/drainage structures. In&#13;
all components, physical targets have been set that take account of MAFF's weak initial&#13;
implementation and absorptive capacity, and the over-riding objective to build up that capacity&#13;
through various means.&#13;
2.19  Information for Future Development of the Sector. By project completion the project&#13;
would have begun to generate important information outputs. These include information systems&#13;
which would produce valuable data on Cambodian farming and inland fishing systems, a&#13;
national agricultural statistics system (DPSIC), an agronomic technology testing and&#13;
demonstration system (DOA), a hydrology information system (GDIMH), a crop pest database&#13;
(DOA), a sectoral public investment program database (DPSIC), and a personnel and job&#13;
description database (HRD). Some information outputs would be the result of one-off studies and&#13;
surveys such as smallholder rubber research results, evaluations of small-scale agricultural&#13;
hydraulics schemes, the vaccine production privatisation study, training needs assessments,&#13;
statistical surveys, farming systems studies and field trial results, a feasibility study of a medium-&#13;
scale agricultural hydraulics scheme7, and component monitoring and evaluation reports. These&#13;
outputs, together with the technical and analytical skills acquired by MAFF personnel, would&#13;
contribute to improved prioritisation and decision-making capacity within MAFF and an&#13;
improved allocation of resources in the agricultural sector. In some cases, information outputs&#13;
would feed into other project outputs such as field-tested technical recommendations. A critical&#13;
systems output is expected to be an established information flow involving two-way&#13;
communications among the different stakeholders in the agricultural sector that will ensure that&#13;
MAFF promotes technology that responds effectively to real needs.&#13;
The scheme proposed is the Prek Tatam canal rehabilitation, in Prey Veng province, one of the priority&#13;
schemes identified in the 1994 UNDP Irrigation Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.20 Policy Development. In three components of the project, policy outputs would be&#13;
produced: (i) a National Seeds Strategy would be prepared to guide implementation of the seed&#13;
production, multiplication and distribution subcomponent and establish appropriate policies for&#13;
future management of the function, including cost recovery and financial mechanisms necessary&#13;
to permit the development of a commercial seed multiplication industry; (ii) a National Strategy&#13;
for Animal Health and Production, that would clearly define the respective roles of the public&#13;
and private sectors in the light of experience gained under the Project and elsewhere, and provide&#13;
recommendations on the future of the Vaccine Production Laboratory (VPL), presently operated&#13;
by the DAHP. The regulation of basic animal health provision would have been formalised&#13;
through the registration and licensing of village vets; and (iii) in conjunction with expected&#13;
assistance to Government by the UNDP (DDSMS) and ADB, a National Water Resource&#13;
Strategy would be prepared that would clarify present institutional responsibilities for water,&#13;
including the present separation of functions for rural water supply and irrigation planning, and&#13;
make recommendations for participation and cost recovery policies likely to promote sustainable&#13;
development of water resources for agricultural purposes. It is expected that this work would also&#13;
result in a preliminary version of a revised legal framework to address irrigation water usage/&#13;
water rights issues. It was agreed that each of the above three national strategies would be&#13;
prepared by the Government and sent to IDA for comments by December 31, 1998.&#13;

3. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.1    Project cost estimates are based on June 1996 prices. Investment costs have been assigned&#13;
to the following expenditure categories: civil works, vehicles, equipment, materials (for&#13;
laboratory experimentation, field trials and demonstrations), international specialist services&#13;
(technical assistance), studies, overseas and domestic training. Recurrent costs are assigned to the&#13;
categories: staff training and field allowances, and incremental operating expenses (including&#13;
operation and maintenance). Physical contingencies of 10% have been added for civil works,&#13;
materials, field trials and incremental operating expenses. Price contingencies, local and foreign,&#13;
have been included as follows: 5% per annum for local costs and 2.3% per annum for foreign&#13;
costs. Physical contingencies add US$ 0.9 million (3%) and price contingencies US$ 1.9 million&#13;
(6%) to the aggregate base cost estimates.&#13;
3.2    Cost summaries by component and by expenditure account are given in Tables 3.1-2. The&#13;
total base cost8 is US$ 32.2 million equivalent and the total project cost including contingencies&#13;
is US$ 35.1 million, of which 72% is foreign exchange. Excluding estimated taxes and duties of&#13;
US$ 0.5 million, the estimated project cost is US$34.6 million. Investment costs of US$ 24.9&#13;
million are 77% of base costs, the largest category being international specialist services (22%).&#13;
Incremental operating costs of US$ 7.3 million including staff training and field allowances and&#13;
other incremental operating expenses are 23%. Detailed cost tables by project component are&#13;
given in Annex 2.&#13;
8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
The investment cost estimates exclude taxes and duties; it was confirmed at negotiations that all goods required&#13;
for the project would be imported free of duty and tax. Operating costs include a tax/duty component.&#13;

plan broken down by expenditure category is included in Annex 2.&#13;
3.4   The estimated project cost of US$35.1 million equivalent would be financed by:&#13;
(a)   a local contribution of $3.35 million equivalent from the Government of&#13;
Cambodia, financing about 10% of total project cost (or about 8%, excluding&#13;
estimated taxes and duties);&#13;
(b)  the proposed Credit of SDR 18.8 million (US$27.0 million equivalent), financing&#13;
about 77% of total project cost; and&#13;
(c)   an IFAD Loan of SDR 3.3 million (US$ 4.75 million equivalent), financing the&#13;
animal health and production component of the project and covering about 14% of&#13;
total project cost.&#13;
The proposed IDA Credit would be funded under the Interim Trust Fund (ITF) administered by&#13;
IDA and subject to its special eligibility provisions regarding procurement. These provisions&#13;
would not affect the IFAD Loan, which is intended entirely for the parallel financing of the&#13;
livestock component of the Project. It was agreed that the cross-effectiveness date of the IDA&#13;
(ITF) Credit and the IFAD Loan would be March 31, 1997, or such later date as might be agreed.&#13;

C. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.5   The proposed IDA (ITF) Credit of US$27.0 million equivalent and IFAD Loan of&#13;
US$4.75 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of five and a half years with&#13;
disbursements completed by the closing date of June 30, 2002. The disbursement schedule is&#13;
considered feasible, because of the proposed input of technical assistance for project&#13;
implementation and the range of activities included, which reduces the risk that a delay in one&#13;
particular activity would hold up the entire project. A timely start to project implementation and&#13;
disbursement following effectiveness is expected, with mobilization of international TA and first&#13;
deliveries of equipment planned for September 1997.&#13;
3.6   The expected IFAD Loan of US$4.75 million equivalent would provide parallel financing&#13;
for a distinct component of the Project. It would be administered by IDA and disbursed erntirely&#13;
against expenditures under the component for Animal Health and Production. There is no joint&#13;
financing with the IDA (ITF) Credit. However, IFAD Loan disbursement categories and&#13;
percentages were coordinated with those of IDA (ITF) during negotiations to simplify&#13;
disbursement and accounting.&#13;
3.7  IDA (ITF) disbursements would be made against: (a) 80% of total expenditures for civil&#13;
works; (b) 90% of total expenditures for goods and equipment (excluding vehicles); (c) 100% of&#13;
total expenditures for vehicles, which would be imported free of duty; (d) 70% of expenditures&#13;
for agricultural and laboratory materials; (e) 100% of expenditures for consultant services and&#13;
studies; (f) 100% of expenditures for overseas training; (g) 100% of domestic training&#13;
expenditures, including local training allowances; and (h) a declining percentage of project&#13;
operating costs (100% for expenditures incurred during 1997-98, 80% for expenditures incurred&#13;
during 1999, 50% for expenditures incurred in 2000, and 40% for expenditures incurred in 2001&#13;
or later).&#13;
3.8   Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE) for: civil works&#13;
contracts less than $150,000; goods contracts less than $150,000; consulting contracts less than&#13;
$100,000 (firms) and $50,000 (individuals); overseas and domestic training costs; and&#13;
incremental operating expenditures. All documents supporting SOEs would be retained by the&#13;
PMU and made available for random sample review by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
independent auditors. For all contracts above these limits, full documentation would be required.&#13;
3.9   Special Accounts (one for IDA, one for IFAD eligible expenditures) with an aggregate&#13;
authorized allocation of US$2.0 million equivalent, based on four months' average expected&#13;
expenditures, would be established in a bank acceptable to IDA. The PMU at MAFF would&#13;
control and operate the Account, subject to procedures established by the Ministry of Finance&#13;
and to be agreed at negotiations. All documentation for operation of the Accounts would be&#13;
retained at the PMU. Applications for replenishment of the S/A supported by appropriate&#13;
documentation would be submitted regularly -- preferably monthly but not less than quarterly --&#13;
or when the amounts withdrawn equal 20 percent of the initial deposit.&#13;
3.10 MAFF's internal planning and budgeting system is weak and its procedures unclear,&#13;
particularly with respect to reporting and flow of funds arrangements between MAFF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
headquarters and its provincial offices. It needs to be strengthened to avoid internal budget&#13;
management problems affecting implementation of the Project. Some aspects are already being&#13;
addressed under the Ministry's ongoing reorganization, while other measures are being taken by&#13;
the MEF to strengthen financial procedures across all ministries (para 1.16). To help ensure that&#13;
the financial planning and budget systems established for the purpose of the Project are adequate&#13;
and consistent with the systems being put in place more generally, a study would be carried out&#13;
during the first year of the Project, once the PMU is in place. During negotiations it was agreed&#13;
that by September 30. 1997, Government would conduct and send to the Association for&#13;
comments the conclusions and recommendations of a suitable study prepared on the basis of&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. and would implement the study's recommendations&#13;
during the Project taking account of the Association's comments.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.12  Procurement for works, goods and services to be financed by the IDA (ITF) Credit and&#13;
IFAD Loan would be carried out in conformity with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
Under JBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 and revised in January and August&#13;
1996, subject to special eligibility provisions under the ITF financing (para. 3.4). Since the&#13;
procurement capability of the implementing agency is limited, technical assistance for&#13;
procurement activities and supervision of building works would be provided through the PMU&#13;
(para. 4.3). Procurement details would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works. A contract for the construction of a new office/lab building for the&#13;
DOA estimated to cost US$0.7 million would be let through ICB using the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works, January 1995. The&#13;
capacity of private domestic contractors to handle works of this size and type is&#13;
increasing. A preference margin of 7.5% would be given to domestic contractors&#13;
bidding under ICB procedures. Most other building works carried out under the&#13;
project would be small and simple, generally consisting of repair or renovation of&#13;
existing MAFF office buildings and field stations, located at provincial/district&#13;
centers in rural areas. Owing to the dispersed nature and small size of these works&#13;
(less than US$150,000 per contract), National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures, acceptable to the Bank, would be appropriate since international&#13;
contractors are not likely to be interested in bidding but they would attract capable&#13;
local bidders. The total estimated cost of these works, including contingencies, is&#13;
US$1.9 million. Where feasible, the PMU would group them in suitable packages&#13;
of $100,000 or more each so as to reduce the number of contracts with a view to&#13;
economy and efficiency. For this purpose, the PMU and the responsible&#13;
departments concerned would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
Procurement of Works (Smaller Contracts), January 1995. Works mainly for&#13;
building renovation, amounting to an estimated US$0.5 million and typically&#13;
costing less than $50,000 per contract, would not justify NCB procedures and&#13;
would be procured through simplified procurement procedures based on&#13;
evaluation and comparison of at least three quotations from local contractors. As&#13;
the scope of work cannot be defined in advance, sites are remote and there is a&#13;
need to minimize the disruption of ongoing activities, works for rehabilitation of&#13;
small-scale hydraulic structures in two pilot provinces, and for the construction of&#13;
permanent markers for fish sanctuaries, for an estimated cost of US$1.3 million&#13;
would, with IDA's prior agreement, be carried out under force account by the&#13;
MAFF departments concerned.&#13;
(b)   Goods (Equipment. Vehicles, Boats, Vaccines and Office and Laboratory&#13;
Supplies). Vehicles, patrol boats and equipment costing US$5.7 million would be&#13;
procured by ICB procedures (with a preference margin of 15% of the CIF price, or&#13;
the actual customs duty, whichever is lower, granted to domestic manufacturers);&#13;
and goods costing US$1.2 million, with an estimated cost of US$50,000 or less&#13;
per contract, would be procured by NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. This&#13;
would include items such as office equipment and furniture manufactured locally.&#13;
For the latter, PMU would prepare bidding documents based on the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods, January 1995, to be&#13;
cleared by the Bank prior to use. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods&#13;
will be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or&#13;
more each. Imported cattle vaccines and agricultural and laboratory materials&#13;
costing US$1.4 million, with an estimated cost of US$50,000 or less per contract,&#13;
would be purchased by international shopping with at least 3 price quotations&#13;
from at least two countries, under paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
(c)   Training. Contracts for domestic training (US$2.2 million) would be negotiated&#13;
with local training institutions.9 Overseas training agreements, for a total cost of&#13;
US$0.9 million, would be negotiated by PMU and the implementing department&#13;
concerned with the foreign providing institutions. Such agreements would be&#13;
negotiated on a case by case basis, with terms of reference for the proposed&#13;
training and selection criteria for providing institutions and participants to be&#13;
discussed and agreed with the Association.&#13;
(d)   Consulting Services. Contracts for consulting services and studies required under&#13;
the project are estimated to cost a total of US$ 8.7 million, mostly procured from&#13;
the international market. Since the quality of such services is crucial to the success&#13;
of the project, this factor would be given most weight in their selection. The&#13;
services required would be contracted in suitable packages from shortlists of&#13;
appropriately qualified international firms on the basis of technical proposals, in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency and employing as far as practicable&#13;
the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services, June 1995.&#13;
Letters of invitation, evaluation reports and proposed awards of contract would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for prior review.&#13;
3.13  Procurement Review. Civil works contracts costing over $150,000, goods contracts&#13;
costing over $150,000, and consulting service contracts over $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants, would all be subject to prior review by the Bank. This would allow for&#13;
prior review of contracts covering approximately 80% each of the works, goods and services to&#13;
be procured under the project. However, all terms of reference and any single-source selections&#13;
of consulting firms/consultants, regardless of contract value, would be subject to prior review.&#13;
Contracts awarded below the agreed prior review thresholds, and all documentation supporting&#13;
claims for disbursement on the basis of SOEs, would be subject to ex-post review by IDA. Until&#13;
greater experience is gained by the Borrower, it is expected that at least 20 percent of such&#13;
contracts would be subjected to random ex-post review.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1   Project Organization. The project consists of a number of components focused on&#13;
different organizational units within MAFF. These units vary in status from substantial&#13;
institutions to relatively minor divisions. The components can be classified as follows:&#13;
(a)   Subsectoral Programs:&#13;
(i)   Agronomy, Seeds &amp; Plant Protection (DOA)&#13;
(ii)   Agricultural Hydraulics (GDIHM)&#13;
(iii)  Animal Health &amp; Production (DAHP)&#13;
(iv)   Fisheries (DOF)&#13;
(v)   Smallholder Rubber Research (DGPH)&#13;
(b)   Institutional Strengthening Components:&#13;
(i)   Planning &amp; Statistics Strengthening&#13;
(ii)   Human Resource Development &amp; Management&#13;
(iii)  Strengthening Provincial Agricultural Services&#13;
(c)   Project Management Unit&#13;
4.2   The current structure of MAFF is shown in Figure 1 and an institutional analysis is&#13;
presented in Annex 4. An internally-led process of reorganization is under way and further&#13;
changes are expected. Components have largely been designed as self-contained activities within&#13;
the responsible MAFF department and do not depend to any critical extent on other departments&#13;
for implementation. Thus the design is relatively robust with respect to further organizational&#13;
changes in MAFF.&#13;
B. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.3   Management of the project is at three levels -- ministry, department and provincial office&#13;
-- as described below:&#13;
(a)   Ministr level: MAFF will take overall responsibility for the execution of the&#13;
project, through a Project Steering Commitee (PSC) and a Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU). It was agreed that the PSC and PMU shall be maintained throughout&#13;
the period of project implementation. The Secretary of State is expected to be the&#13;
chairman of the Project Steering Committee, the proposed membership of which&#13;
is shown in Annex 5, and will include the Undersecretary of State (Planning), the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Directors/DGs of the participating departments, the Director General of the&#13;
Ministry, and the PMU Project Management Advisor. The full-time project&#13;
coordinator (deputy chief of PMU) will be the secretary to the PSC. The PSC will&#13;
meet at least twice a year and have the following responsibilities:&#13;
(i)    To approve the annual work plans and budgets for the project;&#13;
(ii)   To receive reports on progress of all components, and report to the&#13;
Minister;&#13;
(iii)  To advise the Secretary of State on the resolution of problems;&#13;
(iv)   To ensure that APIP is coordinated with other projects and programs in the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
Coordinating day-to-day execution of the project will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will include representatives of the&#13;
departments concerned. The Under-Secretary of State (Planning) will be Chief of&#13;
PMU, supported by a deputy chief who will be full-time project coordinator. The&#13;
responsibilities of the PMU will be as follows:&#13;
(i)   Secretariat to the PSC;&#13;

PDAs. Technical assistance personnel will be based at provincial&#13;
level for both the irrigation and livestock components and will&#13;
assist the provincial staff in their management responsibilities.&#13;
C. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
4.4   Performance Indicators have been set for the project as a whole and also by component so&#13;
as to measure progress during implementation (achievement of outputs and results) and progress&#13;
towards objectives (achievement of effects and impact). They would also serve as milestones,&#13;
which will confirm that components are proceeding according to plan, or signal that there are&#13;
actual or potential problems requiring remedial action. PIs have been chosen for their value in&#13;
measuring the extent to which the project is likely to achieve its long-term development&#13;
objective.10&#13;
4.5   The main impact indicator for the project as a whole is a measurable increase in capacity&#13;
within MAFF to fulfill its role and responsibilities. The following progress indicators would&#13;
permit both qualitative and quantitative assessment:&#13;
(a)   an HRDM system established and operating effectively within MAFF;&#13;
1  In setting Pls for the proposed project, recent Bank guidelines on Performance Indicators for Technical&#13;
Assistance Operations (document WB/OPRDR 23.1996) have been followed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(b)   sufficient competent senior staff assigned as full-time counterparts in the PMU&#13;
and in each of the project components, with staff trained by the project in&#13;
positions which use their acquired skills and experience;&#13;
(c)   measurable increases in language, analytical, technical and management skills of&#13;
MAFF staff;&#13;
(d)   progress reports from PMU and senior TA assigned in each technical department&#13;
on quality and performance of counterpart staff in project work-planning,&#13;
budgeting, implementation, reporting and trouble-shooting;&#13;
(e)   progress reports from PMU and departmental heads indicating quality and&#13;
performance of TA;&#13;
(f)   clearly prioritised development plans/ programs for the different sub-sectors that&#13;
respond to farmers needs and reflect real constraints and potentials;&#13;
(g)   MAFF actively seeking resources/budget for program implementation from both&#13;
government and donors.&#13;
4.6   Specific impact and progress indicators for each project component and subcomponent&#13;
are given in Annex 2. Table 4.1 below shows the selected development impact indicators&#13;
discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;

D. MONITORING, SUPERVISION, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.7    Monitoring. Monitoring of project activities will be done at two levels. The PMU will be&#13;
responsible for establishing the framework for project wide monitoring. It would cover three&#13;
groups of performance indicators:&#13;
(a)    Physical monitoring of project progress such as procurement, construction of&#13;
buildings, expenditure, holding of PSC and other committee meetings, routine&#13;
reporting etc.&#13;
(b)   Monitoring of human resource development including implementation of training&#13;
needs analyses, completion of personnel registration, execution of training&#13;
programs; and follow-up studies to determine the impact of HRD programs on&#13;
MAFF staff.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring of project impact on intended beneficiaries. This applies mainly to the&#13;
irrigation, livestock and PAS components and will require conducting baseline&#13;
studies and comparison of farmers within project schemes and outside them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.8   This overall framework would be set up with the help of a specialist consultant assigned&#13;
to the PMU, initially for a six month period and then for short follow up visits to supervise&#13;
execution.&#13;
4.9   Each executing department will be responsible for its internal monitoring. Staff from the&#13;
department planning section will be given initial training in monitoring techniques and will then&#13;
be assigned to monitor specific indicators within the overall framework and to prepare routine&#13;
reports. The senior technical advisor for the component will be responsible for ensuring that a&#13;
proper program is set up and followed.&#13;
4.10 Supervision. Because of the rapidly changing environment in Cambodia, at least semi-&#13;
annual supervision missions will need to be fielded, with the authority to approve or recommend&#13;
adjustment of the project if the need arises. These missions will be coordinated and carried out&#13;
by the Bank but IFAD inputs will be included as and when issues on the livestock component&#13;
arise and by mutual agreement between IFAD and the Bank.&#13;
4.11 Mid-Term Review, Evaluation. During the third year of the project it is agreed to carry&#13;
out a -joint mid-term review to assess progzress achieved in implemnenting the pro-ject. and the&#13;
Govenment would thereafter take any necessary measures for its future implementation such as&#13;
to achieve the agreed objectives. On completion of the project, a full evaluation of performance&#13;
will be undertaken for the ICR.&#13;
4.12 Reporting. Monthly reports and accounts will be produced at provincial, department and&#13;
PMU level. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for submission to the Bank and IFAD&#13;
by June 30 and December 31 each year until the Project is completed.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
4.13  The project account would be maintained by the PMU in MAFF, and separate sub-&#13;
accounts for project components/subcomponents would be maintained by each project&#13;
implementing department, in accordance with sound accounting practices. The project accounts&#13;
would reflect all financial transactions during the project implementation period both for the IDA&#13;
and IFAD Credits and for the government counterpart funding, in two books: one by project&#13;
component, and one by standard expenditure categories. The project accounts would be&#13;
maintained separately from any routine budget account or other externally-funded project&#13;
account. Assurances to the above effect were agreed at negotiations .&#13;
4.14  Project accounts would be audited in accordance with Guidelinesfor Financial Reporting&#13;
and Auditing of projects Financed by the World Bank (World Bank, March 1982). Assurances&#13;
were obtained that audits of project-related records and accounts. including the Special Accounts.&#13;
would be undertaken in accordance with accounting principles consistently applied. by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts and financial statements, in a&#13;
format agreed with IDA. and including separate audits of Statements of Expenditures. would be&#13;
furnished to IDA for approval within six months of the end of each Government financial year.&#13;
until completion of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. PROJECT BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The project would build capacity within MAFF and the main development impact would&#13;
thus be institutional. MAFF staff would benefit from intensive training, and experience of the&#13;
implementation of well-resourced, well-designed work-programs which contribute to a coherent&#13;
integrated sectoral program. The ultimate beneficiaries are rural communities who depend on&#13;
agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods, for assisting whom MAFF is responsible.&#13;
5.2   Rural communities in Cambodia would benefit economically and financially in the&#13;
medium to long term through the adoption of appropriate, sustainable and financially profitable&#13;
agronomic technology and low cost measures for protecting animal health. Additional benefits&#13;
would be obtained from improved surface water storage and drainage for increased production of&#13;
rice and other crops, and from higher and sustained levels of production from freshwater fish&#13;
capture and aquaculture, and ultimately from profitable investment in smallholder rubber&#13;
plantations.&#13;
5.3   The project would also contribute positive nutritional and human health benefits. Greater&#13;
food security, particularly in respect of the main wet season rice crop as a result of improved&#13;
seed availability and water for supplementary irrigation, the increased availability of fish and&#13;
animal protein from the fisheries and livestock components, and crop diversification as a result&#13;
of the farming systems component, would all result in greater adequacy and variety of diet in&#13;
rural areas. A healthier and better fed rural labor force would enjoy higher productivity and a&#13;
better quality of life.&#13;
5.4   Environmental benefits are expected to be achieved in the medium to long term through&#13;
the improved sustainability of rice based farming systems. These would ensue as farmers adopt&#13;
recommended practices with respect to soil fertility management, integrated pest management,&#13;
water management and conservation, and crop diversification. Strengthened fisheries&#13;
conservation, management and research would help ensure that important freshwater capture&#13;
fisheries are not over-exploited and that better knowledge is acquired in order to minimise&#13;
possible negative environmental impacts of future aquaculture development. Rubber research&#13;
would ensure that smalholder rubber plantations are established only in suitable areas.&#13;
5.5   The RGC would benefit fiscally as cost recovery mechanisms would be introduced under&#13;
the project for improved rice seeds, animal vaccines and irrigation water, and as appreciation is&#13;
developed of the areas which are/are not government's budgetary responsibility under a market&#13;
economy. In the long-term, sound and sustainable agricultural development would contribute to&#13;
Cambodia's foreign exchange earnings and provide a stronger and broader base for domestic&#13;
resource mobilization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.6   The economic analysis undertaken during appraisal involved a detailed evaluation of the&#13;
costs and benefits of each planned output, and of the risks and assumptions inherent in the&#13;
means-ends hierarchy. This iterative process which inter alia involved close examination of&#13;
alternative means of achieving objectives and outputs, aimed to produce project components&#13;
whose outputs would contribute most reliably and cost-effectively to sub-sectoral immediate&#13;
objectives and the project's development goal.&#13;
5.7   To achieve the objective of capacity building in MAFF, the project includes a heavy&#13;
investment in training (US$ 5.1 million) and a Human Resources Development and Management&#13;
(HRDM) component, to ensure that all training has an impact on job performance and effective&#13;
accomplishment of project workplans. Additionally, and more importantly for sustainable&#13;
development of the sector, it would establish and institutionalize the process of managing&#13;
training and human resources effectively within the Ministry. Recognising that an institution&#13;
building objective may conflict with the achievement of physical targets, the project has been&#13;
designed with deliberately limited and realistically achievable targets. However, cost&#13;
effectiveness analyses indicate that in some areas (HRDM in particular) the investment per&#13;
beneficiary is relatively high for benefits which are difficult to quantify; the high cost is largely&#13;
due to the substantial technical assistance requirement. The expected outputs from investment in&#13;
HRDM are nevertheless considered to be crucial for the success of the project and economically&#13;
justifiable given the project's capacity building core objective and the importance for the&#13;
country's long term development of creating technical, planning and management capacity in the&#13;
agriculture sector.&#13;
5.8   For project components expected to have a direct impact on production levels (livestock,&#13;
small-scale agricultural hydraulics, seed multiplication, and integrated pest management), an&#13;
indicative economic analysis was carried out on the stream of incremental costs and benefits&#13;
directly associated with the investment, projected over 15 years. Comparisons were made with&#13;
the results of ADOR I 11 for which detailed domestic resource cost (DRC) calculations were&#13;
made for the major agricultural commodities produced in Cambodia. For outputs and most&#13;
inputs, market prices were used as a proxy for economic prices, since minimal distortions to&#13;
market prices were identified. For unskilled rural labor a shadow wage rate of US$0.50 per day&#13;
was used, representing a conversion factor of approximately 0.50.&#13;
5.9   For the livestock component, the base case ERR over 15 years is estimated at 36%. The&#13;
analysis demonstrates the economic attractiveness of investment in animal health care and&#13;
sensitivity tests confirm it. Recurrent costs would be minimal as farmers themselves would pay&#13;
the full cost of maintaining privatized village veterinary services.&#13;
5.10  The small-scale agricultural hydraulics sub-component is designed to demonstrate the&#13;
viability of small-scale irrigation in two pilot provinces and therefore has deliberately limited&#13;
physical development targets. Costs per scheme include all sub-component management costs&#13;
FAO Investment Centre: Cambodia Agriculture Development Options Review (Phase 1), 3 vols, April 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
except technical assistance, plus unskilled rural labor for scheme construction and operation &amp;&#13;
maintenance shadow-priced at $0.50/md, and all other operation and maintenance costs; and&#13;
benefits assume an incremental production of wet season rice and some high-value vegetables&#13;
and/or fresh fish. The potential ERR per scheme is 25%; when conservative assumptions are&#13;
made on both net incremental benefits and adoption rates, the indicative ERR decreases to only&#13;
11%. As is well appreciated, each potential site is unique and economic viability is a function of&#13;
many variables beyond the control of the project. The analysis nevertheless indicates that small-&#13;
scale irrigation rehabilitation should be economic provided that agreed site selection criteria are&#13;
followed and provides sufficient justification for proceeding with a well-targeted demonstration&#13;
phase. Project outputs in terms of experience and results will feed into policy decisions as to&#13;
whether and how RGC should invest further in the sub-sector.&#13;
5.11   An indicative cost benefit analysis of the seed multiplication program gives an ERR of&#13;
17%, if only first round benefits from using recommended seed are included, and 38% if second&#13;
round benefits are included. The analysis includes all subcomponent costs, assumes that&#13;
foundation seed would be sold from seed farms at a price reflecting its direct cost of production,&#13;
and demonstrates that recurrent costs would be more than covered by sales revenues as well as&#13;
the overall economic benefits to farmers of this program.&#13;
5.12  A base case ERR of 26% was calculated for the IPM  sub-component, with all sub-&#13;
component management costs included except TA. If the uncontrolled use of pesticides&#13;
continues unchecked , rice-fish farmers would expect substantially decreased catches. When&#13;
incremental fishing benefits (prevention of losses) are included in the analysis, the estimated&#13;
ERR rises to 42%.&#13;
5.13   The overall conclusion of economic analysis is confirmation that the project would&#13;
strengthen MAFF capacity in areas which require an initial public sector investment but only a&#13;
modest recurrent budget and which can generate valuable returns to the economy.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.14  Project preparation has been participatory and APIP's components focus firmly on&#13;
MAFF's priorities for the sector. The involvement and commitment of senior MAFF officials to&#13;
the project from the very beginning has given a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for&#13;
the successful implementation and sustainability of the project and its component activities.&#13;
5.15   Only through cost recovery can investments in support of development be made&#13;
sustainable. With government agreement, design of the project has foreseen direct cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms wherever possible. Thus, entities involved in seed multiplication would have to pay&#13;
for foundation seed and farmers would pay for extension seeds; the retail provision of basic&#13;
animal health services will be done through private, unsubsidized village vets; a site selection&#13;
requirement for small-scale irrigation development is an unskilled labor contribution to scheme&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance; fish producers must purchase fishery concessions,&#13;
licenses, hatchery-produced fish fry and fingerlings and pay substantial fines for illegal fishing.&#13;
In addition APIP would finance studies, training, strategy development, data collection, and&#13;
economic viability assessments that would establish the feasibility of future privatization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
services or cost recovery arrangements. These would include recommended practices for&#13;
smallholder rubber development, evaluation of results in small-scale irrigation development,&#13;
training in economics and data analysis for policy planners, and a privatization study for animal&#13;
vaccine production. Thus APIP would build MAFF's capacity as a facilitator, regulator and&#13;
demonstrator of new technology, not as provider of free goods and services. The expectation is&#13;
that farmers will pay for goods and services necessary to increase their production, once they are&#13;
convinced that it is profitable to use them and so long as the risks are not too great. Recurrent&#13;
costs of maintaining sub-sector programs after the end of the project are estimated at about&#13;
US$ 1.0 million per year or less.&#13;
5.16  The sustained execution of MAFF sub-programs will depend on whether capacity built&#13;
under the project will continue in post (staff) and in operation (plant and equipment, vehicles,&#13;
buildings, laboratories) to serve the needs of agricultural communities in the medium to long&#13;
term. This will in part depend on factors outside the management control of the project, such as&#13;
the expected reform (down-sizing) of the civil service and public sector pay scales, political&#13;
commitment and stability, and funding constraints on operational budgets. The sustainability and&#13;
development impact of agricultural development programs implemented through MAFF will&#13;
depend inter alia upon the extent to which these wider objectives are met.&#13;
D. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.17  Exogenous risks to the project referred to in the previous section include:&#13;
(a)   rural insecurity, which may continue to hamper field activities in some areas of&#13;
the country;&#13;
(b)   fragility of the political situation -- the planned elections in 1998 may distract&#13;
attention and divert budgetary resources from the project;&#13;
(c)   chronic funding constraints of the government and its possible inability to provide&#13;
budgetary resources on an ongoing basis to ensure the sustainability of the&#13;
programs started under the project;&#13;
(d)   difficulty  in coordinating  the work-programs of the different technical&#13;
departments of MAFF and between headquarters and the provincial/district&#13;
offices; and&#13;
(e)   an increasing turn-over of trained staff due to low  motivation and poor&#13;
remuneration in the public service.&#13;
The project has been designed in the full awareness of these risks and measures have been&#13;
taken to minimise their effects.&#13;
5.18  The risk of inadequate counterpart staff commitment and that trained staff will not be&#13;
continuously assigned in jobs which use their skills and experience is addressed directly in the&#13;
project. Sufficient resources would be provided to ensure adequate incentives (e.g. through staff&#13;
training and travel allowances) to staff to perform their duties under the project, and to establish&#13;
work programs that ensure individual job satisfaction and delivery of quality services in response&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
to client needs. This should encourage a much higher level of inter-departmental cooperation in&#13;
MAFF as well as individual job performance.&#13;
5.19  The shortage of well-qualified and experienced staff in the Ministry is both a reason for&#13;
the project and a risk to its successful implementation. Formal training amounts to 11% of&#13;
project base costs and HRDM is given particular importance. Long-term overseas training has&#13;
been kept to a minimum so as to ensure that able staff mostly remain in Cambodia, working as&#13;
counterparts alongside international specialists, and gain experience and intensive on-the-job&#13;
training through the project. Funds for language training have been included where required so as&#13;
to facilitate communication and understanding between local and international project staff. For&#13;
the same reason, all long term international project staff would be expected to become conversant&#13;
in the Khmer language within six months of arrival in post.&#13;
5.20  Implementation performance indicators would be monitored throughout the project.&#13;
Problems would be identified, their causes analysed and possible solutions fed back to PMU and&#13;
the relevant technical departments. This would ensure that workplans and targets get readjusted&#13;
in line with developing implementation capacities.&#13;
5.21  It will take time to build analytical, managerial, and technical skills in MAFF and the&#13;
project includes a large and necessary amount of technical assistance. There is a risk inherent in&#13;
the potential conflict between meeting implementation targets and building national capacities.&#13;
In some cases it may be necessary and desirable to trade-off short-term effects for long-term&#13;
sustainable impact. Project targets have been deliberately set so that the potential for conflict&#13;
between objectives is minimised. In evaluating bids for provision of TA, the MAFF needs to be&#13;
aware of this risk and give a high weighting to both technical/analytical and management/human&#13;
sets of skills.&#13;
5.22  The only risk that cannot be controlled through project design is that of continuing&#13;
insecurity in rural areas. Over the past year, there have been major political developments as a&#13;
result of which the zone of high insecurity has contracted, but some risks remain. Project design&#13;
has taken these into account by excluding or reducing project activities in provinces still&#13;
considered insecure. In addition, the pilot field components could be relocated to other provinces&#13;
if necessary.&#13;

PERFORMANCE AND IMPACT INDICATORS&#13;
1.    These measure the extent to which the project is likely to achieve the longer-term&#13;
development impact that is foreseen at appraisal. They indicate whether the project is&#13;
likely to have positive or negative development impact, and whether its benefits will&#13;
exceed its costs. APIP's impact is expected in the medium to long term and indicators of&#13;
development impact are therefore for the most part inappropriate within the proposed&#13;
seven year investment period. For the project's field sub-components, however, specific&#13;
indicators have been chosen to measure expected impact of the seed program, the IPM&#13;
program, basic animal health services, small-scale agricultural hydraulics, and freshwater&#13;
fish "seed" (see Table 1).&#13;

2.    For the capacity building and research-oriented components, indicators are&#13;
required to gauge the project's implementation performance. The objective of the project&#13;
as a whole is the development of capacity within MAFF to fulfil its role and&#13;
responsibilities, inter alia, to design and implement technically sound and economically&#13;
rational sub-sector programs independently and/or in equal partnership with NGOs and&#13;
1Os. This is an especially difficult characteristic to measure objectively. The approach&#13;
taken in APIP is to monitor the attainment of main outputs by component, their quantity,&#13;
quality and timeliness and to use this information as implementation progress/process&#13;
indicators (see Table 2). Output targets would be specified in detail (attainment&#13;
percentages, dates, quantities, qualifiers) for each component (and where appropriate,&#13;
sub-component) in the first three months of project effectiveness by each technical&#13;

Fisheries&#13;
27.   Development impact is expected in the medium to long term in sustainable&#13;
increased artisanal, and family production from inland capture fisheries and aquaculture.&#13;
APIP would contribute to this through the achievement of project outputs in the&#13;
following three areas:&#13;
(a)   fisheries conservation and management including stock assessment,&#13;
prevention of over-exploitation, restocking, maintenance of catch per unit&#13;
of effort (CPUE), and rehabilitation of fish breeding/nursery/feeding&#13;
habitats;&#13;
(b)   fishery seed supply (fry and fingerlings); and&#13;
(c)   institutional strengthening of Department of Fisheries (DOF).&#13;
28.   Main ouputs: production of fingerlings increased from 850,000 in 1995 to about&#13;
2 million by 2003; production of fry increased from 2 to about 5 million over the same&#13;
period; fisheries legislation revised and enforced through strengthened monitoring,&#13;
control and surveillance functions of DOF; freshwater fisheries database.&#13;

conservation planning; trained motivated staff.&#13;
Smallholder Rubber Research&#13;
31.   The long-term goal of APIP's rubber research component is smallholder rubber&#13;
production contributing significantly and sustainably to rural incomes and to foreign&#13;
exchange earnings. Research results (main outputs) would provide key data necessary to&#13;
target resources to the sub-sector most efficiently and cost effectively. The research&#13;
would identify (i) the geographical areas (soils and climate) which are especially suitable,&#13;
and the strains (clones) that are likely to be the most productive given Cambodian agro-&#13;
ecological conditions; (ii) enterprise combinations (rubber and temporary inter-cropping,&#13;
rubber and permanent inter-cropping, rubber and livestock raising and/or fish-farming)&#13;
that would promote successful establishment of the young trees as well as generate an&#13;
adequate interim cash flow for the farmer. In addition, data would be gathered on existing&#13;
cultural practices and on farmers' responses to new technologies.&#13;
32.   Main research outputs: recommendations at to most suitable areas and plant types;&#13;
recommendations as to which farm enterprises to combine with rubber so as to optimise&#13;
agronomic as well as financial returns, especially during the establishment period; reports&#13;
containing analyses and evaluation of (i) current practices as regards production,&#13;
exploitation and collection of rubber, (iii) field demonstrations, (iii) farmers' responses/&#13;
reactions to new technologies/alternative enterprise mixes; from amongst the staff of&#13;
DGPH, trained managers and technicians able to design and implement on-farm rubber&#13;
research, to analyze results and to develop recommendations; an information bank on&#13;
smallholder rubber including both technical and socio-economic data such as suitable&#13;
soils, climate, plant types, farming practices at all stages of production (traditional and&#13;
new), farmers' responses, and research methodology.&#13;

ECONOMIC AND RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    With the exception of livestock health and production, APIP's components are not&#13;
designed to improve agricultural productivity directly, but rather to facilitate, accelerate and/or&#13;
remove constraints to increases in agricultural productivity of small farmers and fishermen in the&#13;
medium to long run. Project design reflects considered judgments of the means by which MAFF&#13;
can best support private entrepreneurial efforts in the agricultural sector, given the priorities of&#13;
RGC and the low level of agricultural productivity in Cambodia. The economic analysis&#13;
involved a detailed evaluation of the costs and benefits of each planned output, and of the risks&#13;
and assumptions inherent in the means-ends hierarchy. This iterative process which inter alia&#13;
involved close examination of alternative means of achieving the component objectives, has&#13;
resulted in components which are expected to contribute most critically and cost-effectively to&#13;
the project's development goal. Thus the loan funds would be used in ways which will maximize&#13;
the net present value to the country.&#13;
AGRONOMY&#13;
Overall Capacity Building in the Department of Agronomy (DoA) and Technical&#13;
Coordination&#13;
2.    Research management and applied research programs would typically have an&#13;
measurable impact on agricultural development 5-10 years downstream. That impact would&#13;
partially depend on effective extension and other services and sound policies. Capacity and&#13;
experience built though APIP's Agronomy component would provide major contributions to this,&#13;
without which goals for the sector are very unlikely to be achieved. As a result of the project,&#13;
DoA would&#13;
(a)   coordinate and target agricultural research on country's priorities;&#13;
(b)   identify potentials and constraints, and develop appropriate technical solutions;&#13;
(c)   test technical solutions on-farm;&#13;
(d)   provide technical recommendations/support to DATEE, Provincial Departments&#13;
of Agriculture (PDAs), and other agricultural stakeholders.&#13;
3.    The overall justification for medium to long term investment in these processes is the&#13;
overwhelming importance of the agricultural sector in the economy, and a recognition that new&#13;
technology, improved resource allocation, and investment in the sector are critical to future&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3&#13;

Soil Fertility/Conservation Program:&#13;
4.     Maintenance of soil fertility is critical for the sustainability of agricultural productivity.&#13;
Farmers need to use scarce working capital and incremental labor so as to maximize profit. For&#13;
example, they should increase inorganic fertilizer application up until the marginal revenue&#13;
product per dollar spent is equal to the marginal cost, and undertake mulching and composting&#13;
up until the MRP of labor is equal to the opportunity cost of labor. Farmers need to be made&#13;
aware of the costs of alternative means of maintaining/ enhancing soil fertility (fallowing, crop&#13;
rotation, manuring, etc.). FAO/OSRO (Office for Special Relief Operations) has compiled a&#13;
database as to fertilizer use and response of the main varieties of rice in different agro-ecological&#13;
conditions and soil types in Cambodia   In addition, CIAP has completed about 30 very&#13;
controlled on-station trials. These fertilizer trials have generated a sizable body of information&#13;
indicating the situations in which it pays to apply mineral fertilizers. DoA (though APIP) would&#13;
further this important work by undertaking together with provincial agronomy and extension&#13;
personnel (link to PAS), an extensive farmer-managed on-farm trial and demonstration program&#13;
using a participatory approach. Feedback from farmers is considered central to the development&#13;
of economically sound inorganic fertilizer recommendations for low-land rainfed rice and to a&#13;
greater understanding of the constraints faced by farmers in the use of inputs like inorganic&#13;
fertilizer. This work will link in closely with the activities of the Farming Systems sub-&#13;
component.&#13;
5.     About three quarters of fertilizer used in the country is supplied through the private sector&#13;
and in the medium term, consumption can be expected to increase significantly, especially in&#13;
areas with high population densities and good water control. The market for fertilizer is thus&#13;
increasingly free of distortion.&#13;
Farming Systems and Crop Diversification Program&#13;
6.     The justification for this sub-component is based on the importance of the agricultural&#13;
sector, the need to develop MAFF's understanding of the constraints and conditions of&#13;
Cambodian farming systems; so as to develop technically appropriate, economically viable and&#13;
socially/culturally acceptable strategies and specific recommendations for improving and&#13;
sustaining productivity. Farming systems in Cambodia are overwhelmingly rice-based and so the&#13;
primary focus would be on these. In addition however, DoA would explore the potential for&#13;
future crop diversification in terms of spreading/reducing risks, sustaining the resource base,&#13;
making profits. The potential for cultivation of alternative food and industrial crops, particularly&#13;
tree crops, in the upland areas is good. Diversification would contribute to (a) improved human&#13;
The results of 1,500 on-farm fertiliser trials conducted by FAO/OSRO since 1992 indicate average yield increases&#13;
of I .7ton (range from 1 .2ton/ha to 2.9ton/ha) from a fertiliser application rate of 41-46-0 with a productivity index&#13;
of 14, cost/benefit ratio of 2.3 and risk index of 4.4%. However, for local varieties sown in areas without water&#13;
control, mineral fertilization in unlikely to be economic at medium to high doses and farmers are unlikely to take&#13;
the risks involved.&#13;
&#13;

nutrition; (ii) environmental stability and sustainable farming systems; and (iii) greater diversity&#13;
in marketable crops for local consumption and export.&#13;
Seeds Program&#13;
7.    Although HYVs of rice suitable to the agro-ecological environments in Cambodia have&#13;
been/are being developed by CIAP 2 (this is a sunk cost), sufficient quantities of recommended&#13;
seed  are not available as there is no seed multiplication system. This is clearly a critical&#13;
constraint on agricultural productivity improvement in Cambodia. Quite apart from the growing&#13;
and so-far unmet demand for improved seed from NGOs, 1Os, and bilaterals, there is widespread&#13;
evidence that farmers themselves are willing to pay a premium for seed of improved varieties and&#13;
some go to considerable lengths to get hold of a supply. This sub-component is thus entirely&#13;
demand driven.&#13;
8.    A yield increase of 10% is attributed to the use of improved seeds alone, holding all other&#13;
factors constant. The seed sub-component is expected to give an economic rate of return (EIRR)&#13;
of 17% on the investment (see tables xx). This is based on an economic valuation of the benefits&#13;
of using extension seed for one year only; if the additional net incremental benefits are included&#13;
in the analysis (benefits resulting if the same area is planted with the next generation of grain&#13;
retained by the farmer), the EIRR rises to 38%. The benefits are thus expected to amply justify&#13;
the economic cost of the seed production program/sub-component. The indicative analysis takes&#13;
no account of the fact that planting rates per hectare may decline as better seed tends to have a&#13;
higher germination rate, that farmers are likely to plant improved varieties of grain retained as&#13;
seed for more than one additional year and on a larger area, and that the incremental net benefit&#13;
stream was extended over 15 years only. The EIRR is thus a conservative estimate of the&#13;
considerable economic advantage to the country of investment in a national seed strategy, in&#13;
foundation seed production and in public sector support for and quality control of private sector&#13;
seed multiplication by the private sector (including outgrowers, entrepreneurs, farmer&#13;
associations, agricultural projects, PAS, NGOs, etc.,).&#13;
9.    Institutional arrangements including options for cost recovery would need to be reviewed&#13;
as part of the process of establishing a national seed strategy. Ideally, all users/recipients without&#13;
exception would be required to pay for Foundation Seed (the first multiplication of breeder seed&#13;
produced on seed farms under strict control and supervision of the breeder). When government or&#13;
the ministry itself requires seed for specific development or emergency programs, these would be&#13;
duly purchased from the seed program by the agencies supporting the programs for which seed is&#13;
required or with regular budget allocation. The annual revenue (which, by the year 2000, would&#13;
be about US$ 200,000) would be made available through a revolving fund exclusively for the (i)&#13;
operation of the seed farms (the recurrent cost of foundation seed production are expected to be&#13;
about US$ 70,000 per annum); (ii) management and supervision of extension seed&#13;

multiplication; and (iii) collection, cleaning, drying, quality control, packaging, and marketing of&#13;
extension seed. The sustainability of the program and of the continued availability of quality rice&#13;
seed will depend on these revenues being available to cover the recurrent costs of the seed&#13;
program.&#13;
Plant Protection Service (i) Institution Establishment&#13;
10.   Whereas it is not possible to quantify the medium to long term benefits which are&#13;
expected to result from the establishment of a Plant Protection Service, the indications (inter alia&#13;
from the economic analysis of IPM) are that they are likely to contribute significantly to&#13;
agricultural productivity. Information on pests and pest control options would feed into wider&#13;
pest control recommendations which, if adopted, would increase yields, reduce crop losses (both&#13;
in-field and post-harvest) which are estimated to be in the region of 20%, ensure that farmers'&#13;
expenditure on pesticide is timely, appropriate and thus cost-effective, protect health and hence&#13;
labor productivity (days lost through pesticide poisoning), and reduce environmental damage.&#13;
11.   There is no capacity in Cambodia to identify and control pests, no quarantine&#13;
mechanisms and no legal framework for the control of plant/animal movements within and into&#13;
the country. The sub-component would train a small core of specialists, establish a modest plant&#13;
protection laboratory in Phnom Penh and develop a legal framework to ensure adequate plant&#13;
protection and agro-chemical regulation in Cambodia; and maintain a database on crop pest&#13;
problems 4. In summary, the foundation would be laid for Cambodia's Plant Protection Service.&#13;
12.   The justification for this sub-component is medium-long term. The objective is that cost-&#13;
effective, technically efficient pest control recommendations are transmitted through the&#13;
extension system and that seeds (see APIP's investment in seed sub-component) and other&#13;
planting materials would be protected from pests and diseases.&#13;
Plant Protection - (ii) Integrated Pest Management&#13;
13.   The misuse and overuse of chemicals to control agricultural pests has adverse effects on&#13;
farm budgets, human health and the environment. The widespread adoption of IPM would result&#13;
in:&#13;
(a)   reduced production costs, increased yields and improved profitability for farmers;&#13;
(b)   improved sustainability of intensified crop production;&#13;
(c)   reduced risk of acute and chronic pesticide poisoning (reduced medical&#13;
expenditure and increased labor productivity);&#13;
(d)   improved/maintained outputs from rice/fish cultivation.&#13;
This would result from field research designed to systematically identify major pests, diseases and weeds using a&#13;
participatory approach involving farmers, extension workers and through the IPM FFSs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
14.   Data is not available in Cambodia which could be used as a basis for calculating the&#13;
precise level of each of these benefits. There is clear evidence, however, for (a) 5. An illustrative&#13;
cost benefit analysis (CBA) of the sub-component shows that 16,000 FFS trained farmers&#13;
adopting IPM on an average of 0.5 ha and benefiting to the tune of $12/ha per season for 15&#13;
years would produce an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on the investment of 9%. This&#13;
conservative picture reflects the fact that in Cambodia present levels of pesticide use have not&#13;
reached those of irrigated rice farmers in neighboring counties. If the present trend were to&#13;
continue unabated and uncontrolled, the without project scenario would be more expensive both&#13;
in financial and environmental terns, and the with project benefits (savings) proportionately&#13;
greater.&#13;
15.   The base case CBA takes no account of the savings that are expected to accrue in&#13;
maintained catches of fish. The Fisheries Department of MAFF has studied the potential loss of&#13;
fish as a result of pesticide use in Cambodia. The financial value of the estimated total catch of&#13;
wild fish from secondary wetlands and rice fields is between 15,000 and 20,000 tons per year&#13;
valued at $2,000/ton. At least 20% of this would be lost if pesticide use became common&#13;
practice in the rice fields. The fish catch in the rice fields may lie between 50 and 80 /kg /ha.&#13;
Assuming an economic value of $1.0/kg and average losses due to pesticide poisoning of 20%,&#13;
the value of maintained fish stocks is estimated at an additional 10 - 16 kg/ha worth about&#13;
$13/ha. This additional incremental benefit increases the indicative EIRR to 19%.&#13;
16.   The health costs of using pesticides in Cambodia are difficult to calculate, but given the&#13;
type of chemicals being used by Cambodia farmers and the method of application, it seems&#13;
certain that thousands of farmers are suffering from mild poisoning which is reducing their&#13;
productivity. Studies carried out by IRRI in the Philippines have calculated that the health costs&#13;
of pesticide use, at the level of farmers normal practices, are more than $50 per year, including&#13;
treatment and lost time.&#13;
17.   The sub-component cost per trained farmer (excluding the TA financed by FAO) is $80,&#13;
which compares favorably with the per capita economic benefit over 10/15 years. This included&#13;
the training costs of trainers. By the end of the project, Cambodia will have 90 provincial IPM&#13;
trainers who, with a modest recurrent budget (eg.:$500 per FFS X 180 FFS per year = $90,000&#13;
per annum) would be able to continue to conduct IPM farmer training programs each year with&#13;
concomitant benefits to the country. APIP's investment in IPM is thus considered to have a&#13;
strong economic justification with economic benefits accruing from project year 1.&#13;
MAFF collaborated with IDRC in 1994 and 1995, and organised pilot Farmer Field Schools (FFSs) The results&#13;
show that the use of pesticides fell by 73%, from 1.8 to 0.48 applications per fanner. This reduction in pesticide&#13;
applications produces a saving of approximately $12 a season. There was also an increase in crop yield of 15%&#13;
(from 3.88 t/ha/yr to 4.45 t/ha/yr across two seasons on irrigated rice) resulting from the improved crop husbandry&#13;
that farmers learn during FFS. The value of the increased yield is approximately $90 /ha/yr.&#13;
&#13;

18.   The financial analyses clearly demonstrate the profitability to farmers of paying for&#13;
preventive animal health care. In all case the incremental financial benefit overwhelmingly&#13;
justifies the initial outlay that is required. In addition the viability of privatizing the provision of&#13;
basic animal health services at village level is confirmed. An average annual village veterinary&#13;
income of US$ 225 per annum would provide sufficient incentive for investment in training, and&#13;
equipment and active village vets would increase their income as village livestock through-put&#13;
increases, and/or by expanding operations into neighboring villages.&#13;
19.   Previous studies 6 demonstrated that Cambodia has a comparative advantage in producing&#13;
livestock for its own consumption and that the degree of competitiveness would be improved&#13;
substantially from the traditional production system to a better disease control system. The&#13;
studies clearly indicate that Cambodia would expect resource savings arising from the delivery of&#13;
basic animal health services to smallholder livestock producers. The economic advantages to&#13;
Cambodia of cattle and buffalo vaccination were also demonstrated in ADOR 1 7. The cost&#13;
benefit analysis projected a cattle herd for 1,000 households using (i) traditional and (ii)&#13;
improved parameters for mortality and holding all other factors constant in order to evaluate the&#13;
incremental benefit attributable to a livestock vaccination program. The hypothetical herd&#13;
increased by 15 % over 20 years (an average 2 - 3% per annum), and at the then cost of&#13;
vaccination and parasite control (Riel 1,500 per animal per year), the results showed an&#13;
incremental economic benefit per 1000 households rising from US$ 1,300 in the first year of&#13;
vaccination, to US$ 2,300 per year.&#13;
20.   The cost benefit analysis of APIP's livestock component assumes that over the life of the&#13;
project 1000 villages will receive basic animal health and production services. Using financial&#13;
prices as a best estimate of economic values, and a conservative phased adoption by farmers of&#13;
improved health care practices with respect of pigs, poultry, buffalo and cattle, and projecting the&#13;
net incremental benefit stream over twenty years, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is&#13;
36%. (If a lower economic value for draft powered land preparation of Riel 80,000/ha, is used,&#13;
the EIRR remains robust at 33%)&#13;
21.   In addition, the economic justification for cattle and buffalo vaccination was reassessed&#13;
using the same parameters as were used in ADOR 1 and 1996 prices. The Net Present Value&#13;
(NPV) of the incremental benefit stream remains positive at a 12 % discount rate until the cost of&#13;
basic animal health care per animal reaches a switching value of Riel 6,600. Present estimates are&#13;

Page 7 of 18&#13;
that the cost per animal of vaccination is no more than Riel 2,000 per head and thus there is a&#13;
strong economic justification for vaccination.&#13;
22.   The direct cost of mobilizing a village vet is US$ 260 (training $ 200 + start-up medicine&#13;
grant $60). This is equivalent to the current annual salary of a provincial/district level technician,&#13;
but it is a once only cost. This means of delivering animal health and production services at&#13;
village level is cheaper, and likely to be much more effective in reaching the target group than&#13;
any other form of livestock extension system. It would be backed up by the media, and video&#13;
extension messages delivered through OAHPs.&#13;
AGRICULTURAL HYDRAULICS&#13;
23.   The core sub-component, Small-Scale Agricultural Hydraulics, involves selecting sites,&#13;
and designing and constructing structures to test the hypothesis that the rehabilitation of shallow-&#13;
bunded reservoirs and other small-scale agricultural hydraulic structures "makes economic&#13;
sense". Physical and financial monitoring of implementation of the "pilot" projects would&#13;
generate inter alia cost and benefit data presently unavailable in Cambodia, which would inform&#13;
decisions as to whether Cambodia should continue to invest in small-scale irrigation. The&#13;
Department of Hydrology (DoH) capacity building/HRD and Management Information System&#13;
(MIS) sub-components are designed to develop the skills, capacity and database to do this&#13;
effectively. The DoH will thus be able to design and implement small and medium scale&#13;
irrigation development in the future, if they prove to be economically viable.&#13;
24.   Both the Irrigation Rehabilitation Study in Cambodia, undertaken by Halcrow (June&#13;
1994) and ADOR I were pessimistic as to the economic justification for investment in irrigation.&#13;
The economic analyses in both studies assessed the broad magnitude of benefits attributable to&#13;
irrigation that are achievable under a range of cropping patterns and intensities. Based on benefit&#13;
8&#13;
estimates "the maximum affordable capital cost per hectare" was calculated . This indicated the&#13;
likely upper limit of affordable investment in irrigation rehabilitation given 1994 costs and&#13;
prices. The results depend on the assumptions as to (i) the cropping intensity, and (ii) whether&#13;
irrigation benefits only, or irrigation plus flood protection plus input benefits. The analysis&#13;
assumed a dry season yield of 2.5 t/ha and a benefit from supplementary wet season irrigation of&#13;
0.5 t/ha. If assured water supplies lead to higher input use in the wet season, yield benefit might&#13;
rise to 1.0 t/ha. Both studies indicate that the cost/ha for schemes which provide only&#13;
supplementary irrigation to a wet season paddy crop is likely to exceed the incremental benefits&#13;
from crop production. The expected outputs of APIP's small-scale agricultural hydraulics&#13;
component will confirm or reject this finding.&#13;
8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
Maximum affordable cost per hectare may be defined as the investment cost per hectare which makes the present&#13;
value of costs equal to the present value of benefits, less operation, maintenance and replacement costs, at a&#13;
discount rate of 10%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 8 of 18&#13;
25.   There is a serious lack of cost and benefit data for small-scale irrigation rehabilitation and&#13;
development in Cambodia. So the economic analysis undertaken for this component is based on&#13;
ADOR 1 and is merely indicative (Tables ...). The sub-component itself would produce the&#13;
experience and data necessary to evaluate the economic viability of future investments in this&#13;
sub-sector. Using an economic value for paddy derived from border prices and calculated at&#13;
Riel 400/kg, the average incremental yield of 0.76 t/ha resulting from assured water supplies,&#13;
improved seeds and higher. input use in the wet season gives an incremental net benefit per&#13;
hectare of $77. Potential additional net benefits from vegetables, fish, and/or some dry season&#13;
crop production, are valued at Riel 120,000. If farmers use the stored water for secondary&#13;
production, the potential net incremental benefit increases to $125/ha. A small scale irrigation&#13;
scheme would be justified by an EIRR of 12% as long as the average net incremental benefit is&#13;
equal to or greater than US$ 100 (Riel 250,000) per hectare. This would be a guideline for site&#13;
selection and provide a starting point for discussions with rural communities as to their&#13;
incremental income expectations and their willingness to invest labor in scheme rehabilitation,&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
26.   Incremental labor requirements for scheme construction are estimated at 120 labor days&#13;
per hectare. For a scheme of 75 ha, a total of 9,000 labor days could be required. In a village of&#13;
150 families, each family would have to provide 60 labor days, which is considered to be within&#13;
the average family capacity. Without food-for-work rice or payment for days worked, there is&#13;
some risk that unskilled village labor would not be sufficiently available. (see Risks by&#13;
component section)&#13;
27.   Thus, APIP's pilot schemes would be selected where the expected benefits are the highest&#13;
and where the risks associated with implementation and achievement of development impact&#13;
appear to be the lowest. In the medium to long run, rural communities and RGC will benefit only&#13;
if small-scale irrigation projects generate greater economic benefits than costs. Both the&#13;
investment and recurrent costs of irrigation rehabilitation are relatively high (but not really&#13;
known and even higher for new irrigation development), and need to be carried by an&#13;
incremental benefit per hectare receiving supplementary irrigation and/or other incremental&#13;
economic benefits attributable to surface water storage (fisheries, livestock, etc).&#13;
FISHERIES&#13;
28.   Fish and fisheries products, especially those from inland (lake, river and flood plain)&#13;
fisheries have traditionally been the single most important source of protein for the Cambodian&#13;
people; fish accounts for 40-60 percent of their protein intake. Annual per capita consumption&#13;
was 20-25kg in 1960s and is now estimated at 13-16kg. Therefore there are important nutritional&#13;
as well as welfare reasons for seeking to maintain present levels of consumption through rational&#13;
exploitation and sustainable resource use. Inland fisheries are effectively unregulated and APIP's&#13;
fisheries component would revise the legal framework, strengthen the enforcement of regulations&#13;
on fishery exploitation, and pilot sustainable community-based management of fish resources.&#13;
Besides wild fish capture, aquaculture offers an excellent opportunity for income generation and&#13;
improved nutrition in rural areas. However, there are constraints (notably lack of seed) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 9 of 18&#13;
pitfalls, and sustainable aquaculture development require careful extension of appropriate&#13;
technology and supervision to avoid adverse environmental impact. APIP's support to technology&#13;
development through combining fry production, hatchery management, training and research at&#13;
the fresh water research station at Chriang Chamres, would enable the Department of Fisheries to&#13;
develop a model for sustainable aquaculture and inland fishery development.&#13;
29.   The component has been designed taking into account the experience and&#13;
recommendations of Department of Fisheries, the DANIDA/MRC Fisheries project and the FAO&#13;
sector review (1994), and APIP's budgetary provision is considered necessary and sufficient to&#13;
achieve the planned outputs.&#13;
SMALLHOLDER RUBBER RESEARCH:&#13;
30.   Rubber has important potential as a vector for rural development in Cambodia. It&#13;
generates foreign exchange earnings and contributes to government revenues. Figures for 1994&#13;
indicate an export volume of 35,000 tons valued at US$ 26 million. Unrecorded exports were&#13;
valued at an additional US$ 15 million making a total foreign exchange earnings from rubber to&#13;
US$ 41 million in 1994. The value of total rubber exports are estimated at US$ 40 million in&#13;
1995, and US$ 50 million in 1996. After logs and sawn timber (US$ 153 million), rubber is the&#13;
next most important agricultural export.&#13;
31.   ADOR 1 calculations of domestic resource costs for small-holder rubber indicate that&#13;
Cambodia has a strong comparative advantage in producing rubber for export. Economic&#13;
analysis indicates that for one hectare of rubber under small-holder management the economic&#13;
IRR is 26% for new plantation rubber and 36% for rehabilitated rubber (see ADOR 1, Annex 8,&#13;
Tables 44 and 45,). Sensitivity analysis was done for the shadow rural wage rate which is an&#13;
important element in the cost structure and the results remain convincing. They show Cambodia&#13;
retains its comparative advantage of earlier years as a producer of quality natural rubber for the&#13;
world market and indicate that smallholder rubber development would create productive&#13;
employment opportunities, alleviate poverty amongst small-holders, stimulate agro-industrial&#13;
development and foster regional development. APIP would finance research as to the&#13;
feasibility/suitability/most appropriate areas, plant types, farming systems and technologies for&#13;
smallholder rubber development as the first step in ensuring that investments in the sub-sector&#13;
are targeted so as to achieve the greatest returns.&#13;
PLANNING &amp; STATISTICS&#13;
32.   Cambodia's economy is, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, dominated by&#13;
agriculture and agribusiness. MAFF needs the capacity to manage the policy and planning&#13;
process and to implement projects in the sector, whether donor-assisted or not. Many of the&#13;
policies affecting the sector, are not under the direct control of MAFF, and so MAFF must also&#13;
be able to influence the decisions made in other parts of government. In an environment of&#13;
intense competition for scarce government resources, MAFF must be able to convince allocators&#13;
of resources that top budgetary priority must be accorded to those programs and projects that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 10 of 18&#13;
contribute to agricultural and rural growth and thus economic development. MAFF also needs&#13;
the ability to transform policies into strategic plans, programs and projects. APIP support to&#13;
DPSIC would develop capacity in agricultural statistics, economic and policy analysis, planning&#13;
and project design to help MAFF to fulfill these critical functions. (see Options Paper No.7,&#13;
ADOR II)&#13;
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT/MANAGEMENT:&#13;
33.   Key constraints in MAFF have been identified as the lack of human resource capacity and&#13;
skills, and poor job performance. APIP (like many other projects) includes a heavy investment in&#13;
training (US$ 5.106 million), which is designed to build skills and capability. Experience shows&#13;
that not infrequently training is poorly targeted; trained people are transferred out of, or not&#13;
assigned to jobs where their skills are needed. Training is ineffective and expensively acquired&#13;
skills under-used; trained staff become frustrated; and overall staff performance may even&#13;
deteriorate. If training needs are properly assessed and jobs described, then a serious attempt can&#13;
be made to match people with posts, thus optimizing human resource allocation. To be effective,&#13;
HRD/HRM must be located in a central and senior location in MAFF's institutional structure. It&#13;
is designed to create the culture and institute the processes necessary to ensure that for the&#13;
foreseeable future: all training efforts are coordinated, appropriate people are selected for&#13;
training; trained people are given jobs in the organization where their skills are necessary and&#13;
relevant; and thus the human resources within the Ministry are managed optimally. Through&#13;
managing APIP's training effort, MAFF would develop HRD/HRM systems and "learn how to&#13;
do HRD" on-the-job. This would increase the likelihood that APIP's training would usefully and&#13;
sustainable build MAFF capacity and have an impact on job performance and realization of all&#13;
project workplans (quantitative and qualitative) of the Ministry. Additionally, and more&#13;
importantly, it would establish and institutionalize that system/process within the Ministry.&#13;
Recurrent cost implications/Sustainability:&#13;
34.   Project preparation, which grew of the participatory review of agricultural development&#13;
options undertaken between April and September 1994 (ADOR II), has been itself participatory,&#13;
and APIP's components focus firmly on MAFF's priorities for the sector. The strong involvement&#13;
and commitment of senior MAFF staff has given them a sense of ownership and responsibility&#13;
for the successful implementation and sustainability of the different programs.&#13;
35.   Only through cost recovery can investments in support of development be made&#13;
sustainable. With the agreement of RGC, wherever possible APIP's design has built in direct&#13;
cost recovery mechanisms (thus agencies must pay for foundation seeds and farmers must pay&#13;
for extension seeds, the provision of basic animal health services is through private village vets, a&#13;
site selection requirement for pilot small-scale irrigation rehabilitation is an unskilled labor&#13;
contribution to construction, operation and maintenance, fish producers must purchase fishery&#13;
concessions, licenses, hatchery-produced fish fry and fingerlings and pay fines for illegal fishing.&#13;
In addition APIP would finance studies, training, strategy development, data collection, and&#13;
economic viability assessments that would provide the basis and justification for future&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
privatization of services or cost recovery arrangements. These include a national small-holder&#13;
rubber development plan, evaluation of pilot schemes in small-scale irrigation development,&#13;
training in economics and data analysis for policy planners, a privatization study for vaccine&#13;
production. APIP would build MAFF's capacity as facilitator, regulator and demonstrator of new&#13;
technology, not as provider of free goods and services. The expectation is that farmers will pay&#13;
for goods and services necessary to increase their production, once they are convinced that it is&#13;
profitable and as long as the risks are not too great. Thus every attempt has been made to&#13;
minimize the recurrent costs of maintaining sub-sector programs and key MAFF activities after&#13;
the end of the project investment period.&#13;
Monitoring, Supervision, Evaluation and Reporting&#13;
36.   Monitoring would be linked to performance indicators and milestones pre-selected for&#13;
each component and agreed with the borrower at Appraisal. Monitoring would be done at both&#13;
project and component level, and would involve tracking implementation performance and&#13;
development impact. This would be achieved through:&#13;
(a)   routine physical and financial monitoring of project progress against workplans&#13;
and budgets;&#13;
(b)   judging (when qualitative) and measuring (when quantitative) performance of&#13;
each of the project components against pre-selected indicators at pre-selected&#13;
intervals; and&#13;
(c)   conducting studies as a basis for comparisons between participating and non-&#13;
participating MAFF staff and farmers so as to assess (where possible quantify and&#13;
qualify) and attribute project delivery and spread of benefits.&#13;
37.   At the project level, the PMU with short-term support from an international monitoring&#13;
specialist would be responsible for establishing the framework and scope for project-wide&#13;
monitoring. Project implementation indicators, which should be defined as input, process or&#13;
output indicators, would be clearly identified in workplans and used to monitor procurement,&#13;
disbursement, construction, appointment of staff and technical assistance, management&#13;
performance, adherence to covenanted actions, and availability of counterparts funds. At the&#13;
component level, each executing department would be responsible for its internal monitoring.&#13;
Staff from each department's planning section would be given initial training in monitoring&#13;
techniques and would then be assigned to monitor specific indicators and to prepare routine&#13;
reports. The senior technical adviser would be responsible for ensuring that a proper and&#13;
realistically achievable monitoring system is set up and followed. In addition he would ensure&#13;
that its results feed back to management in a timely and usable manner, with&#13;
problems/bottlenecks having been identified, their causes analyzed and possible solutions&#13;
outlined. Because of the evolving institutional environment in Cambodia and exogenous risks&#13;
(see section XX), the World Bank would carry out biannual supervision missions with the&#13;
authority to adjust features of the project as the need arises. On completing of the project, a full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 12 of 18&#13;
evaluation of performance would be undertaken. Monthly reports and accounts would be&#13;
required at provincial, departmental and PMU level, from which, full biannual reports would be&#13;
prepared for submission to MAFF, the World Bank and IFAD.&#13;
Risk Assessment and Management&#13;
38.   There are two kinds of risk. Exogenous risks may affect project implementation and&#13;
outcome, but project management has little power to influence them. Endogenous risks fall&#13;
within project management responsibility and can be minimized by responsive and timely&#13;
adjustments. These are the main areas of concern:&#13;
(a)   the security situation in the country, which may make it difficult to undertake&#13;
field activities in some areas of the country;&#13;
(b)   the fragility of the political situation (the likelihood of election fever in 1997 and&#13;
1998 distracting attention/hijacking (counterpart) resources from the project;&#13;
(c)   the funding constraints of RGC and its ability provide resources on an ongoing&#13;
basis to ensure the sustainability of the programs;&#13;
(d)   the difficulty in coordinating the work-programs of the different technical&#13;
departments of MAFF (DoA, DGPH, DGIMH, DAHP, DoF, DATEE, DPSIC)&#13;
and in gaining the support and cooperation of provincial and district offices,&#13;
especially as the scarcity of resources tends to result in* competition rather than&#13;
collaboration;&#13;
(e)   the high turn-over of trained staff due to low motivation, poor remuneration and&#13;
high demand in the private sector for their skills;&#13;
39.   The project has been designed in the full awareness of these risks and measures have been&#13;
taken to minimize their effects.&#13;
40.   The risk of inadequate counterpart staff commitment and that trained staff will not be&#13;
continuously assigned in jobs which use their skills and experience is addressed directly in APIP.&#13;
Sufficient resources have been provided through the project for adequate incentives (staff&#13;
training and travel allowances) and the maintenance of a work program that ensures both job&#13;
satisfaction and continued delivery of services/responses to needs expressed by clients. This&#13;
should encourage a high level of inter-departmental cooperation as well as job performance. The&#13;
shortage of well-qualified and experienced staff in the Ministry is both a reason for the project&#13;
and a risk. Formal training is 11% of the project base costs and Human Resource Development&#13;
and Management (HRD/HRM) is given particular importance. Long-term overseas training has&#13;
been kept to a minimum so as to ensure that able staff are in Cambodia, working as counterparts&#13;
alongside international specialists, gain experience and intensive on-the-job training. Funds for&#13;
language training have been included so as to promote communication and understanding&#13;
between local and international project staff. Implementation performance indicators would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
monitored throughout the project. Problems would be identified, their causes analyzed and&#13;
alternative solutions fed back to PMU and the relevant technical departments. This would ensure&#13;
that workplans and targets get readjusted in line with developing implementation capacities.&#13;
41.  It will take time to build analytical, managerial, and technical skills in MAFF and APIP&#13;
includes a large and necessary amount of TA. There is a risk inherent in the potential conflict&#13;
between meeting implementation targets and building national capacities. In some cases it may&#13;
be necessary and desirable to trade-off short-term effects for long-term sustainable impact.&#13;
Project targets have been deliberately so that the potential for conflict between objectives is&#13;
minimized. In evaluating bids for/bilateral provision of TA, MAFF needs to be aware of this risk&#13;
and choose TA with both technical and human skills and experience. (A willingness to learn&#13;
Khmer may reflect commitment to TA/counterpart collaboration and skills transfer).&#13;
RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT BY COMPONENT&#13;
Agronomy&#13;
42.   There is a risk of excessive concentration on research station and laboratory research,&#13;
rather than collecting information from within the country and elsewhere, testing the alternatives&#13;
in farmers fields and developing recommendations. The component does not seek to develop in&#13;
DoA the capacity to undertake research, though there is a recognition that Cambodia may wish to&#13;
have its own national agricultural research system (NARS) at some point in the future. This&#13;
additional goal may divert attention from field work. Indicators have been chosen which will&#13;
ensure that the component is evaluated on the basis of completed field trials, developed&#13;
recommendations, and the success of its technology transfer efforts. At the end of the project's&#13;
life, DoA would have the capacity to manage, co-ordinate and direct agricultural research and&#13;
development efforts; to evaluate and test research results, and to develop agronomic&#13;
recommendations. Only if research results feed into such recommendations, which are then&#13;
adopted by farmers, will the costs of the research and development effort be justified.&#13;
43.   The risks associated with weak or inadequate linkages between DoA and the technology&#13;
transfer and extension process in Cambodia is well recognized. The Department of Training,&#13;
Economics and Extension (DTEE) is newly responsible for the transfer of technology to farmers.&#13;
Whether the investment in capacity building in DoA is justified, will depend on successful&#13;
technology transfer, and hence on the establishment of strong and effective linkages with DTEE&#13;
as it develops its functions/modus operandi. For example, DTEE will have a well-resourced&#13;
media unit, requiring inter alia DoA recommendations. If DTEE fails to transfer technology&#13;
successfully (indicated by farmer adoption rates), the economic justification for DoA support, is&#13;
seriously undermined. Farmers are the ultimate clients of DoA, and it is their crop productivity&#13;
that DoA research and development activities are designed to enhance. DTEE is being supported&#13;
by a five year AusAID project which started in October 1995 and it is too early to judge whether&#13;
DTEE /AusAID will successfully develop and implement extension system. DoA's responsibility&#13;
is to ensure that (i) strong linkages are forged and continuous dialogue takes place with DTEE,&#13;
and (ii) DoA recommendations are tested, proven and appropriate. As the different stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 14 of 18&#13;
(DoA and DTEE) are being provided with adequate resources, the "competition factor" will be&#13;
minimized and the likelihood of effective collaboration enhanced.&#13;
44.   DoA effectiveness will also depend on linkages with the Provincial Departments of&#13;
Agriculture (PDAs), as their role evolves in what may become a decentralized system of&#13;
government service delivery. By providing support to PDAs, APIP ensures that the PDAs&#13;
participate in the process of MAFF strengthening. The outputs of this collaboration would&#13;
include some proven and tested strategies for cost effective (i) farmer level technology testing;&#13;
(ii) farmer level technology transfer; (iii) two-way transmission system of technical concerns to&#13;
DoA/recommendations from DoA. DoA programs in seed multiplication, soil fertility, plant&#13;
protection and importantly farming systems would be planned and implemented in tandem with&#13;
the PDAs (especially the five provinces 9 receiving support for field programs under the project)&#13;
and, to the extent possible, informed by the extension approach being adopted and strengthened&#13;
by DTEE. Good linkages should prevent duplication of effort and/or contradiction of&#13;
recommendations/approach. Results of field trials should be analyzed (through participatory&#13;
farmer field days and provincial workshops) and disseminated widely at provincial and district&#13;
level, as well as at national level. DoA has the advantage of having (under-utilized because&#13;
under-resourced) staff at provincial and district level who will continue to have a direct role in&#13;
helping farmers improve their productivity. These staff, who are responsible administratively to&#13;
the PDA and technically to the Department of Agronomy, would be key players in strengthening&#13;
the DoA/PDA linkages. The DoA Technical Coordination Office would be responsible for&#13;
institutionalizing and managing these key linkages and for ensuring that the other DoA sub-&#13;
components use/respond to them. Component success requires that a technology&#13;
transfer/extension strategy for MAFF is agreed and institutionalized, so that recommendations&#13;
coming from DoA will be adopted by smallholders, including women.&#13;
45.   For applied and adaptive research, the main risks would be overcome with high quality of&#13;
TA, strong linkages/coordination with DTEE and PDAs, and workplans that minimize on-station&#13;
research, and maximize the testing of research results and development of recommendations&#13;
though participatory on-farm trials managed by farmers (including women) and supervised by&#13;
provincial and district agronomy/ extension staff. The careful selection of sites for on-farm&#13;
research and the close collaboration of farmers and other disciplines within agriculture will be&#13;
critical to success. All studies, surveys and on-farm research should be undertaken with and&#13;
through provincial and district staff of the PDAs. This will provide on-the-job training, and&#13;
increase the likelihood that local constraints and potentials are recognized. Reports/workshops&#13;
analyzing farming systems/crop diversification options should be distributed/held at local level.&#13;
46.   The risk of duplication of effort occurs because there are many different agencies&#13;
promoting agricultural and rural development in Cambodia and a serious lack of coordination.&#13;
By strengthening the technical capability of DOA, APIP increases the likelihood that other&#13;
agencies and ministries would seek DOAs technical support. By working together with DTEE&#13;
Kompong Thom, Kompong Cham, Kratie, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
and PDAs in particular, and having an operational and properly funded field program, DoA staff&#13;
would learn from the experience of other departments and RGC ministries, particularly the&#13;
Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), which through CARERE/UNDP and PRASAC/EU is&#13;
increasingly involved with agricultural development activities (including seed multiplication,&#13;
credit, input supply, fruit trees and agro-forestry).&#13;
47.   The Seed Strategy depends on government support for a proper regulatory framework for&#13;
the national seed sector and strict adherence to the cost recovery arrangements established within&#13;
that framework. Ideally foundation seed should only be released to a client, whether government&#13;
or not, upon payment.&#13;
48.   There is a very low risk that trained farmers will not adopt IPM because of FAO&#13;
experience in the region, which is utilized in a proven design of the sub-component and the&#13;
proven financial incentive to adopt.&#13;
Animal Health And Production&#13;
49.   Notwithstanding the difficulties that the govermment has in financing their provision,&#13;
there is uncertainty as to the level of government commitment to the full privatization of the&#13;
supply and delivery of veterinary services, traditionally the main "raison d'etre" of DAHP. In&#13;
general the senior management of the DAHP support the private village vet approach and the&#13;
privatization of the supply chain. Where DAHP is less certain is whether to support the&#13;
privatization of the Vaccine Production Laboratory (VPL). This is partly for strategic reasons and&#13;
partly because it will erode the facilities of which DAHP can claim credit. The main risk of the&#13;
component is thus concerned with the successful privatization of the vaccination service. To&#13;
provide an efficient service, adequate supplies of the right types of vaccine have to be available&#13;
at the district offices. These vaccines will come from a variety of sources including VPL, and&#13;
careful planning of procurement and control of stocks will be required. At the wrap up meeting&#13;
MAFF was asked to consider its policy and communicate its decisions to IFAD and the Bank by&#13;
March 30th 1996.&#13;
50.   The provision of credit for livestock is a second risk. This has been successfully done on&#13;
a small scale by NGOs but the implementation of a program for 10,500 loans will be more&#13;
difficult to control and supervise properly. Furthermore the design envisages tapping into&#13;
external credit programs rather than creating a self contained credit program. Since the potential&#13;
external programs are not yet fully established, a definite commitment cannot be made. This&#13;
should be possible by appraisal; if not, conditions can be included which must be met before the&#13;
program is initiated. The economic analysis assumes no benefit from credit.&#13;
51.   The benefits of the management and livestock feed activity are difficult to be certain of.&#13;
There is technology available proven in other countries but the adaptation of this and its&#13;
dissemination is more difficult than that of disease control technology. The absence of trained&#13;
staff in this field and prior experience makes it more risky. The initiative is kept small to&#13;
minimize the risk and no benefits have been assumed in the financial and economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
52.   There is a small risk that the MAFF and DAHP would be unable to co-ordinate the&#13;
livestock development component to be financed by IFAD with projects financed by other&#13;
external donors in the animal health and production sector in the four provinces, to avoid any&#13;
unnecessary inconsistency or disturbance, as requested by the mission at the wrap-up meeting&#13;
with the DAHP.&#13;
Agricultural Hydraulics&#13;
53.   There is a risk that APIP builds capacity, as well as expectations, in GDIMH to&#13;
implement uneconomic agricultural hydraulics projects. Irrigation projects tend to fail more often&#13;
on economic grounds rather than technical grounds, perhaps because operation and maintenance&#13;
costs are simply too high relative to the incremental financial benefits i.e. such schemes are&#13;
economically non-viable.&#13;
54.   The component costs do not include the cost of unskilled labor for construction and&#13;
canals. It is assumed that the villagers would provide such labor as an unpaid beneficiary&#13;
contribution. Both the fact that other villages have received WFP food-for-work for small-scale&#13;
agricultural hydraulics projects, and rural poverty, may deter villagers from foregoing their&#13;
alternative activities, so that they are less prepared to provide free labor. A rough estimate&#13;
suggests that each family may have to provide up to 60 labor days during scheme construction.&#13;
The management of unskilled labor requires a degree of village organization that may not exist in&#13;
some Cambodian villages. The component would promote village coordination and farmer&#13;
participation during site selection and construction by involving provincial DoA and MRD staff&#13;
in the Project Implementation Teams. Labor availability and village management considerations&#13;
also have implications for the schemes' operation and maintenance requirements.&#13;
55.   The key issues in irrigation sector work (in every country) are (i) operation and&#13;
maintenance; (ii) water users groups/associations; (iii) water user charges/cost recovery. These&#13;
issues are not adequately addressed in APIP and so there is the risk of not achieving minimum&#13;
benefits. Once the water is assured, there is no provision for further support and/or farmer&#13;
training. The extent to which progress is made in piloting ways of managing water and charging&#13;
for water will depend on collaboration between the different MAFF staff at district and&#13;
provincial levels, and the quality of the TA.&#13;
56.   Economic sustainability requires that a proper cost recovery/water charging policy, for&#13;
small-scale irrigation schemes be established. The policy should at least ensure that funds are&#13;
available to finance the proper O&amp;M of irrigation systems, once constructed and rehabilitated.&#13;
Such a policy, once implemented, would encourage efficient use of water resources. These are&#13;
unlikely to be achieved within the life of the project.&#13;
57.   Benefits from small-scale irrigation rehabilitation would be sustainable ONLY IF an&#13;
O&amp;M organization is developed simultaneously, with farmers assuming some of the&#13;
responsibilities. Experience in Cambodia of joint village-level operation and maintenance of&#13;
drinking water does not augur well; surveys show that within a couple of years of installation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 94 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 17 of 18&#13;
50% are inoperative despite the undoubted benefits to the local community. For APIP this means&#13;
that considerable emphasis must be placed on securing beneficiary participation at all stages of&#13;
planning and implementation of the pilot schemes, and for evidence of community mobilization&#13;
and commitment being a critical (without which, no) selection criterion.&#13;
58.   There may be other more cost effective and less complex means of addressing problems&#13;
of low incomes and local food insecurity. It should not be assumed that all existing schemes are&#13;
good candidates for rehabilitation. A scheme /site may have been abandoned because of flaws in&#13;
design or farmer indifference.&#13;
59.   While recognizing the priority and importance RGC and MAFF give to irrigation, APIP&#13;
has addressed all these risk by reducing the scope of the small-scale agricultural hydraulics sub-&#13;
component from four to two pilot provinces, so that sufficient time and effort is spent on scheme&#13;
selection and planning, on the 'softer' aspects of irrigation, and on evaluating the viability of&#13;
investing further in the sub-sector. In view of all these uncertainties, APIP's field activities are&#13;
experimental and pilot.&#13;
Fisheries&#13;
60.   There is a small risk that RGC will delay in promulgating the revised fisheries legislation.&#13;
Smallholder Rubber Research&#13;
61.   No significant risks.&#13;
Statistics&#13;
62.   There may be problems in collecting statistical data of high quality because of lack of&#13;
motivation by district level field staff, and the unwillingness on the part of farmers to provide&#13;
accurate data. The first risk is addressed through training and field allowances which would&#13;
provide a thorough appreciation of the importance of using proper statistical techniques and&#13;
maintaining accuracy in reporting. The second risk is exogenous and is expected to lessen as&#13;
confidence increases in government.&#13;
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
63.   There are a variety of risks inherent to this approach. Successful progress will require that&#13;
full-time, competent and sufficiently senior counterpart staff are assigned to HRD/HRM. The&#13;
risk that these are unavailable is medium to medium-high. There is a concern that job and&#13;
training selection are based on political exigencies and patronage, not on merit, suitability,&#13;
qualifications and experience. These criteria for selection will continue to some extent; and will&#13;
limit the effectiveness of HRD/HRM. The developing culture of merit will take some time to&#13;
establish, but the process needs to be started and the long-term gains are expected to be worth the&#13;
investment. It may be argued that MAFF is still in the process of defining its role and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 18 of 18&#13;
responsibilities in the sector and there is a risk that investment in HRD/HRM is premature.&#13;
APIP's heavy investment in HRD/HRM reflects the position that HRD/HRM needs to be part of&#13;
the process and will contribute importantly to it through the definition and description of jobs,&#13;
tasks and through training needs assessment (TNA).&#13;

INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF MAFF&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Up to the 1993 election, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (MAFF) had&#13;
responsibility for all of Cambodia's natural resources, their protection and economic exploitation&#13;
apart from the rubber industry which was an institution of Cabinet rank. Subsequent to the&#13;
election, this anomaly was rectified and DGPH was placed within the structure of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture as a Directorate General. At the same time the institutional arrangements for the&#13;
sector were made more complex by the creation of the Ministries of Rural Development and&#13;
Environment. Integration of MAFF technical activities therefore requires not only effective&#13;
linkages between different departments within the Ministry itself but also close collaboration&#13;
with two other Ministries and their constituent departments. As a further complication to the&#13;
equation, linkages also need to be clarified between the central departments of MAFF in Phnom&#13;
Penh and the Provincial Offices of Agriculture.&#13;
2.    In the previous government, the Ministry structure was designed to carry out its functions&#13;
in a centrally planned environment in which the Ministry of Planning handed down the annual&#13;
targets and plans which passed through the central MAFF and on to the provincial and district&#13;
offices. Departments such as COCMA and "Agricultural Machinery" distributed fertilizer and&#13;
ploughed land to try and achieve these targets and scarce funds were distributed from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance according to the plan. In these circumstances each department in MAFF had&#13;
a clearly defined role and target and neither ministry nor constituent departments had to exercise&#13;
much initiative. Although the system had all the limitations of a centrally planned economy, it&#13;
was straightforward to implement. The ministry now faces a much more demanding role with&#13;
increasing responsibility for taking its own initiative.&#13;
3.    Unfortunately the legacy that the Command Economy has left is a Ministry with no&#13;
experience in planning its own activities, coordinating its own resources, allocating its own funds&#13;
and being able to respond to demands and pressures in a sound and logical manner. The different&#13;
departments are now being courted by a plethora of different interests, private and public,&#13;
national and international, exploitive and green, French and Australian, government and non&#13;
government. The situation is further complicated by the political dimension. Thus the&#13;
beleaguered senior officials in the Ministry and Departments, many of them promoted without&#13;
appropriate qualifications and skills, have a multitude of choices to make having never had to&#13;
take significant decisions before and without competent staff to analyze the issues and present&#13;
properly researched position papers. In this situation, the flat organization structure, still largely&#13;
the status quo, inevitably leads to introspective and defensive departments all guarding their&#13;
territory and each jealous of the other. Furthermore the Ministry itself is jealous of the role of the&#13;
Ministry of Rural Development and suspicious of the Ministry of Environment. Perhaps the only&#13;
thing that the departments can agree on in terms of organization is the perceived need to get&#13;
control of the provincial offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Ministry Reorganization&#13;
4.    The obvious starting point for a properly integrated and managed Ministry is a sound and&#13;
logical structure. Without this a high degree of uncertainty will exist and constituent departments&#13;
will be defensive rather than open. Defensive attitudes, the antithesis of integration, are further&#13;
heightened by the widely known fact that the government is under pressure to reduce the size of&#13;
the civil service. Departments are anxious to justify their existence in as far as it is in their power&#13;
to take positive action.&#13;
5.    Given the perceived inadequacies of the current MAFF structure, a variety of different&#13;
organizations are offering advice and financial support for restructuring. The principle of these&#13;
are:&#13;
*     UNDP, through its public administration reform program, has embarked on a&#13;
logical but complex process which will involve redefining the mandates and&#13;
missions of the Ministries, undertaking functional analysis reorganizing the&#13;
structure and then determining the appropriate manning which is expected to be&#13;
much reduced from existing levels.&#13;
ADOR 1 proposed two possible options focusing particularly on alternatives at&#13;
provincial level but ADOR 2 was unable to make any concrete progress in getting&#13;
policy decisions and settling at least a few of the uncertainties.&#13;
D     Asian Development Bank has approved an Agricultural Sector Loan which&#13;
originally proposed to reorganize all three ministries involved with the natural&#13;
environment suggesting the establishment of two ministries to cover the same field,&#13;
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Rural Development. The final loan agreement drew back from this radical initiative.&#13;
*     A French policy adviser to the Minister of Agriculture has proposed a new structure&#13;
for MAFF which includes five "directions". His proposals have the merit of&#13;
streamlining the Ministry's structure and lessening rather than exacerbating the&#13;
problems of functional integration.&#13;
*     FAO has launched a TCP to examine organization and restructuring of the ministry.&#13;
6.    Since 1993, the main institutional changes to MAFF to have been effected are:&#13;
the appointment of the Director General for the whole ministry&#13;
the transfer of Cadastre to be a cabinet institution,&#13;
the establishment of the Department of Technical and Economic Extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-98 -                               Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
in common with all ministries, the payment of provincial staff directly for Phnom&#13;
Penh rather than through the Governors offices.&#13;
The upgrading of the Department of Hydrology to a general directorate.&#13;
7.    It is believed that further fundamental changes are necessary. However, while there are&#13;
still some features of the structure shown in Figure 1 which are inappropriate to a free market&#13;
economy (COCMA, Department of Machinery. Rubber plantations), the general approach seems&#13;
logical. Is there a need for further analysis and "soul searching" by external experts? Perhaps the&#13;
aid community should encourage MAFF to continue the process of gradual change and seek to&#13;
smooth the way with strategic financial support over a period of time.&#13;
8.    Unfortunately the lack of formal decision taking is raising the stakes in terms of attracting&#13;
donor interest and diverting energy to the extent that the benefit of the eventual decisions taken&#13;
may be outweighed by cost of reaching those decisions. Part of the problem is that the long-&#13;
winded public administration reform program allows an escape clause to decision takers who&#13;
wish to avoid continuing major decisions such as the reduction of the size of the civil service.&#13;
9.    What are the possibilities of improving the functional integration of MAFF technical&#13;
activities in these circumstances? The formal approach of reorganization is likely to be slow and&#13;
unproductive, especially as the concerned industries are likely to remain jealous and/or&#13;
suspicious of each other. The alternative is to look for organic changes and creation of bridges&#13;
between departments.&#13;
Strengthening of Ministerial Authority&#13;
10.   Integration of technical activities in MAFF depends first and foremost on the institutional&#13;
structure of the Ministry. The currently proposed structure of the Ministry is shown in Figure 1.&#13;
Responsibilities for coordination and integration of services lies with the General Direction&#13;
whose duties are as follows:&#13;
-     Coordinate all the activities and works of the ministry and follow up to improve&#13;
application&#13;
-     General administrative summary reports&#13;
-     Training&#13;
-     Accountancy and budget&#13;
-     Development of agricultural sector&#13;
-     Establish the program and measures for the line departments and provincial&#13;
agricultural services&#13;
-     International cooperation and relationships&#13;
-     Applications for approval of regulations&#13;
-     Extension of agricultural technologies&#13;
-     Confidential duties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 99                                  Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
11.   The Director General is responsible for exercising these powers. Although not shown in&#13;
the figure clearly, the DG of the ministry is understood to have authority directly over DGPH and&#13;
GDIHM as the position is senior to the DGs of these departments. The DG therefore has very&#13;
great responsibility for integration of Ministry technical departments, at least in theory. How&#13;
does it work in practice? According to the current incumbent, the position has only just been&#13;
confirmed so the mode of operation is not yet fully established. What is envisaged is that all&#13;
referrals of coordination issues from the departments to the Secretary of State will pass through&#13;
the DG who will call whatever ad hoc committee is necessary to resolve issues. It must be&#13;
doubted whether it will actually work like this given the power of the other DGs and Directors as&#13;
well as the role of the Under-secretaries. Nonetheless the structure appears sound if authority and&#13;
discipline can be exercised.&#13;
12.   Probably the first need is give more authority to the General Directorate of the Ministry&#13;
itself through the strengthening of the service departments, particularly Planning, Personnel and&#13;
Finance. At present the authority of the Secretary and Under Secretaries of State is based chiefly&#13;
on their personal qualities and their political influence. Some are important in decision taking&#13;
while others are largely ignored and considered irrelevant to decisions over projects or policy.&#13;
Without a strong Ministry, the departments, particularly rubber and hydrology but also fisheries&#13;
and forestry, will pursue their own agendas with limited attention to Ministry policy.&#13;
13.   In terms of control, finance is of crucial importance. It is assumed that the Finance&#13;
Department will take on the responsibility of annual budgeting for the whole Ministry,&#13;
supporting the Minister in budget reviews and being responsible for disbursement to the&#13;
departments as well as subsequent internal controls. Given increasing flows of development&#13;
funds, the power that the Secretary of State will be able to exercise through the finance&#13;
department will be very considerable.&#13;
14.   The strengthening of the Department of Planning, Statistics and International Cooperation&#13;
(DPSIC) will also be important in creating a sense of decision taking based on proper analysis of&#13;
issues as well as a rational allocation of responsibilities to departments. The DPSIC with its&#13;
important resource centers such as LUMO and Agriculture Statistics can confer authority on&#13;
Ministry decisions through its possession of information. In addition, there will eventually be a&#13;
requirement that all projects are analyzed internally prior to approval so that they can be&#13;
examined for conformity to national plans and policy and for environmental impact.&#13;
15.   The upgrading of the Department of Staff to a full ministry personnel department will&#13;
also strengthen the authority of the Ministry vis a vis the departments in terms of being a&#13;
potential arbiter of promotions, transfers etc. This department may have the role of executing&#13;
decisions over staff reductions and streamlining of structures agreed under the Public&#13;
Administration Reform Program.&#13;
The budgeting system for the General Directorates may be autonomous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -                               Annex 4&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
16.   While the DPSIC has a formal role to plan the functional integration of constituent&#13;
departments, the other departments will be very important in giving the Ministry real authority to&#13;
exercise control over the departments and to insist on appropriate integration and allocation of&#13;
resources.&#13;
Provincial Offices.&#13;
17.   ADOR 1 emphasized the positive aspects of the Provincial Departments of Agriculture.&#13;
The Directors of Agriculture had responsibility for the operations of all departments represented&#13;
at that level and were required to produce an integrated plan and budget at the beginning of each&#13;
year. Departments were generally housed in the same offices and there appeared to be an&#13;
atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration in many provinces. Even now, visitors to provincial&#13;
offices attend initial meetings chaired by the Director or Vice Director, thus knowledge of&#13;
projects and activities cannot be kept within departments.&#13;
18.   Given the need to encourage integration, it appears that the provincial and district offices&#13;
are important catalysts in this process and that efforts should be made to protect this structure and&#13;
prevent the departments from segregating their staff at this level. This will require more than just&#13;
passivity because, as more funds flow, bigger departments will perhaps seek to establish separate&#13;
offices and pursue their own provincial programs independent of the Director's office. Apart&#13;
from department aspirations, there are senior staff in MAFF who favor returning to the French&#13;
model of vertical integration. Others, recalling the problems of integration and coordination&#13;
which existed then, favor the current structure. The mere fact that staff meet each other in a&#13;
common office is valuable for horizontal integration. In Thailand, where each department has&#13;
established its own provincial offices, integration has to be encouraged through artificial means&#13;
such as joint committees which often serve only to accentuate rivalry.&#13;
19.   Inevitably the importance of the provincial office and therefore its contribution to&#13;
Ministry integration will depend on the allocation of resources. Moves towards decentralization&#13;
now taking place will help to strengthen the role of the provincial departments. Additionally&#13;
donors, similarly to NGOs in the past, may find it more effective to fund projects directly&#13;
through provincial offices which can integrate services of different departments effectively. This&#13;
may give quicker access to rural target groups.&#13;
20.   In summary, provincial offices constitute one way in which functional integration can be&#13;
strengthened and it would a good investment to provide funds to strengthen the offices&#13;
themselves. Facilities and transport might be provided along with training in planning and&#13;
budgeting techniques. Well conceived provincial agricultural plans might attract funds directly&#13;
which would benefit both provincial staff resources as well as specialists from Phnom Penh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Integration Structures&#13;
21.   Recognizing the difficulties of integrating technical activities both within MAFF and&#13;
between MAFF and MRD and Environment, the Government is establishing a hierarchy of&#13;
integration and coordination committees. These include:&#13;
*     The Cambodian Development Council (CDC) which oversees all national&#13;
development policy and has jurisdiction over all public sector institutions. It also&#13;
controls private sector companies through its powers to grant registration and tax&#13;
benefit rights.&#13;
*     An apex Council for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) established in&#13;
November 1994. Although this committee has no permanent secretariat or regular&#13;
agenda, it does provide a forum for discussion of important national issues and for&#13;
high level decision taking. It is therefore one way in which government resources&#13;
are coordinated to tackle issues.&#13;
*     Under the CARD umbrella, specific issues that require the coordination of a range&#13;
of technical services can be addressed. An example is the establishment of the&#13;
Credit Committee for Rural Development (CCRD) under a formal sub-decree in&#13;
February 1995. This committee consists of representatives form MRD and MAFF&#13;
as well as Ministry of Finance, the National Bank and three NGOs involved in rural&#13;
credit programs. This committee is seen as a permanent body with a general&#13;
secretary and a supporting technical unit.&#13;
l    At provincial level there is now a subdecree to establish Provincial Development&#13;
Committees with the heads of each Ministry represented; similarly at district level.&#13;
22.   By and large this approach is particularly appropriate to coordinate and integrate between&#13;
Ministries. Recourse to committees as a general solution to integration problems at lower levels&#13;
is not sound because it slows down the processes of government and decision taking.&#13;
Internal Integration Measures&#13;
23.   At Ministry level, there could be scope to establish some structures to facilitate&#13;
integration and support the General Directorate in its role. For example the Secretary of State&#13;
could establish a "Policy and Planning" Committee consisting of the Directors and Directors&#13;
General of all the line departments e.g. rubber, hydrology, agronomy, forestry, fisheries and&#13;
livestock. This could be a standing committee meeting routinely once a month and with the&#13;
Department of Planning as the secretariat. Agendas would focus particularly on overlapping&#13;
areas and projects cutting across more than one department's responsibilities. Resolutions could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -                                Annex 4&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
be recorded as the basis for internal MAFF decisions where legal decrees or sub decrees were not&#13;
needed.&#13;
24.   A second possibility may be to establish routine transfer of staff between departments.&#13;
Although there are clearly limitations in terms of technical skills to the number of such transfers,&#13;
there are many non-technical positions in the departments, planning, administration, personnel,&#13;
management, where transfer could be possible. In some countries directors are routinely&#13;
transferred to prevent empire building and encourage fresh approaches and management. This&#13;
would help to break down the barriers between departments and encourage allegiance to a fully&#13;
integrated Ministry.&#13;
25.   In certain situations there may be scope to introduce special coordination arrangements.&#13;
One example found in other countries facing the problem of research and extension links is to&#13;
establish coordination committees at the different levels, Ministry, province and district, where&#13;
agronomists present their research and extension staff report on farmers' needs. In irrigation&#13;
schemes, agronomy staff may be provided with space in scheme management offices. Watershed&#13;
management may be better integrated by establishing common facilities for hydrology and&#13;
forestry.&#13;
26.   At a more superficial level but nonetheless as an important "team" building activity,&#13;
MAFF should be required to produce an annual report of its activities in which all technical&#13;
departments are fully examined. For a wider audience, a MAFF newspaper could be produced&#13;
and circulated to provide information on Ministry activities to all employees, covering not only&#13;
technical matters but articles with human content, examples of successful projects etc. This is a&#13;
task that the DTEE could undertake.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
27.   Although the establishment of a more logical structure for MAFF will help to integrate its&#13;
activities, it will probably be some time before it occurs and will certainly not be the "cure-all" to&#13;
a problem which faces all large institutions. When restructuring does occur, the principle&#13;
embodied in the "French" plan, that of reducing the number of departments to five directions&#13;
would have particular merit in encouraging integration.&#13;
28.   Aside from this major issue, there are organic actions which can be taken to improve&#13;
integration. There is a need to increase the central authority of the Ministry by upgrading the&#13;
planning and policy department, the finance department and the department of staff. This will&#13;
give increased power to the director-general to exercise his coordination role. One particular&#13;
strength that MAFF does currently have is a provincial service which is quite well integrated.&#13;
Departments should be discouraged from segregating their staff at this level (i.e. aid agencies&#13;
should not support the construction of new office facilities separate to the main office) and&#13;
donors may like to support the training of provincial staff and the improvement of facilities on a&#13;
provincial rather than departmental basis.&#13;
&#13;

Page 8 of 8&#13;
29.   The development of the decentralization proposals and the establishment of PRDCs etc.&#13;
all with the department heads as members is another way to integrate actions although the size of&#13;
the proposed committees is of concern. Selective establishment of coordination committees is&#13;
particularly useful in inter-ministerial integration and has already been successfully introduced&#13;
by RGOC. It could also be of value within MAFF but is not the panacea to all integration&#13;
problems as Thai experience has amply demonstrated. Finally there are a number of low key&#13;
measures and actions which could be taken to build "team" spirit within the Ministry.&#13;
30.  Integration of MAFF services with the activities of the Ministries of Rural Development&#13;
and Environment will depend primarily on the effective functioning of the Committee for&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development.&#13;

1.    The various project components would be implemented by the responsible technical&#13;
departments, under the coordination at Ministry level of a Project Steering Committee, (PSC)&#13;
comprising the department directors and senior Ministry officials concerned as members, and&#13;
assisted by a Project Management Unit (PMU) with responsibility for budget planning and&#13;
review, monitoring, procurement and disbursement under the APIP. Proposed membership of the&#13;
PSC and staffing of PMU are attached for consideration and would be agreed with the Bank&#13;
during appraisal. The PMU would be assisted full-time during the first half of the project, and&#13;
thereafter on an intermittent basis, by three internationally recruited staff: a Senior Project&#13;
Management &amp; Policy Adviser, who would be the CTA for the project; a Procurement Adviser;&#13;
and a Financial &amp; Administrative Specialist, who would help formulate and establish the&#13;
necessary financial, administrative, reporting and accounting procedures for the smooth running&#13;
of the project. Short term TA would be recruited for supervision of buildings/civil works. In&#13;
addition, a short-term Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Specialist familiar with institutional&#13;
development projects would assist in establishing and maintaining within the PMU and the&#13;
implementing departments a coherent system for monitoring the project's performance&#13;
milestones and impact indicators. A full evaluation of the implementation and results of the&#13;
project would be carried out by the PMU and discussed with the Bank before the close of the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.    Annual work programs and budget requests under the project would be established by the&#13;
relevant offices of the implementing departments, coordinated with any parallel offices&#13;
concerned, approved by the Provincial Governor and, where appropriate, the PRDC in the case of&#13;
provincial activities, sent to the technical department in Phnom Penh for checking and&#13;
compilation and then transmitted to the PMU for review and final approval. The work planning&#13;
and budget system for the project needs to be coordinated with that for the Ministry as a whole,&#13;
which is currently being reorganized. For this reason, the PMU would hire a budget systems&#13;
analyst or chartered accountant to examine the actual programming and budget system in the&#13;
Ministry, with particular reference to the reporting and flow-of-funds relationships between&#13;
headquarters and the provincial offices, and to present recommendations for any amendments to&#13;
this system to be adopted under the project.&#13;

RECOMMENDATIONS STRENGTHENING GENDER AWARENESS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   In Cambodia, over 65% of the farming population are women,1 and their employment in&#13;
the agricultural sector is 80%. Many of these women are either widows, single heads of&#13;
households or unmarried due to the decimation of male population during the war, and the&#13;
emergence of handicapped males after the war. Women took over the traditional roles of men in&#13;
the farms, such as plowing, during the war years and it has continued to the present time.&#13;
However, the Khmer woman's traditional non-participation in village level decision-making&#13;
remained the same. Her multiple roles as home-maker, reproductive partner, mother, farmer,&#13;
animal raiser, income generator, etc. constrain her in farm management decision-making and in&#13;
availing herself with new knowledge that would help her in the home and in the farm.&#13;
2.    The awareness and understanding of rural women's roles by agricultural development&#13;
agents (planners and implementors) is necessary to accommodate practical programs, such as the&#13;
timing or venue of training activities; and to avoid unintended barriers to access to services, such&#13;
as conditions in exchange for irrigation.&#13;
General Issues Identified and Recommendations&#13;
3.    The following main issues were identified as a result of the field visits done with the team&#13;
and the field work done individually employing rapid rural appraisal techniques. They apply&#13;
equally to the livestock, hydrology and agronomy components of APIP.&#13;
(a)   Information Gap - between the availability of data on improved agricultural&#13;
production and animal raising, and the access to information by the mostly&#13;
women farmers who need them. Constraints include illiteracy, limits in mobility&#13;
and time due to multiple roles of women, and absence of extension services. For&#13;
example, men attend the training on how to use fertilizers, but women are the ones&#13;
who administer the application of fertilizers.&#13;
One solution, is to bring an information package right on the village door in a&#13;
simple, comprehensible and visual form. This can be done through the MAFF&#13;
extension program using existing resources. A video show for instance, on the&#13;
basic "how-to's" (such as how to treat sick animals, how to increase agricultural&#13;
produce, etc.) can be shown to the villages on a scheduled basis. The use of video&#13;
had proven effective in the villages during the UNTAG promotions to encourage&#13;
people to vote. Village mobile theaters have been done in the 60s and had proven&#13;
popular among the farmers. When done as a village activity, it becomes a social&#13;

event where both women and men will enthusiastically participate in and make&#13;
time for.&#13;
The gender catalyst can coordinate the flow of such services by liaising with the&#13;
concerned government agencies or NGOs.&#13;
(b) . Needs Assessment (social survey) - on female farmers who mostly perform the&#13;
agricultural labor on top of their multiple roles in the home, (as mother,&#13;
reproductive partner, home-maker, finance manager, animal raiser, farmer, etc.) in&#13;
order to better understand the reasons behind non-participation in village level&#13;
decision-making and to find ways to help them through program planning and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
The needs assessment (social survey) has to be designed as part of the planning&#13;
process in the project components before project implementation.&#13;
(c)   Lack of female extension workers - commonly attributed to the lack of qualified&#13;
and interested applicants, and the constraints of their mobility dictated by cultural&#13;
factors.&#13;
One underlying reason for this is the high rate of illiteracy among women. Even&#13;
for some who manage to further their training or education, they drop out before&#13;
the course is completed. One reason2 pointed out is the inadequate or absence of&#13;
living facilities close to the school or training venue, and the constraints of space&#13;
when living with other people or relatives. Women are prone to be more&#13;
vulnerable than men given this kind of situation.&#13;
In order to increase the number of potential female trainees, incentives are&#13;
necessary to accommodate their needs. Quota can be a way to ensure female&#13;
presence in recruitment, as such in the livestock component, it is recommended&#13;
that 30% of village vets to be trained have to be women. The standards of&#13;
recruitment need not be affected.&#13;
(d)   Lack of female staff or officers within the Ministry of Agriculture. Although there&#13;
is a growing awareness on the importance of putting female officers in the&#13;
government offices, there is a real issue of competition, since very few women are&#13;
qualified. In Kompong Cham for example, there is a newly created Office of&#13;
Extension under MAFF headed by a woman, but of the total number of provincial&#13;
staff numbering 309, only 24 are women. It is necessary to provide additional&#13;
incentives to women, such as living facilities; and to design a more active&#13;
recruitment strategy to attract more women to apply and identify those who are&#13;
qualified.&#13;

Proposed Strategy&#13;
4.   In consistency with the development agencies incorporating gender issues into their&#13;
projects, such as CARERE (doing community development), UNICEF (WID projects), CIDSE&#13;
and OXFAM (gender training), it is proposed that the Bank-supported agriculture and rural&#13;
development projects take a two-pronged approach. From the bottom is village level community&#13;
development organization incorporating gender orientation among extension agents and village&#13;
development committees; and from the top is gender orientation and training among government&#13;
policy makers, researchers and key actors from the agencies involved in this project.&#13;
5.    t is considered that a need for consciousness-raising is necessary as a starting point for&#13;
gender sensitivity, otherwise even simple activities designed in the village level may not be&#13;
understood. This basic educational process is essential so that the concept of gender is&#13;
understood and consequently, can influence program planning. It will also avoid misconceptions&#13;
(such as role-reversal, inconsistency with Khmer culture, Western bias, etc.) which may cause&#13;
discomfort in many men.&#13;
6.    Unless this consciousness-raising is done through orientation training, it will be difficult&#13;
for the government at all levels to understand the constraints faced by women farmers who&#13;
comprise the majority of agricultural labor in Cambodia. A gender perspective is therefore&#13;
necessary in the assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of APIP.&#13;
7.    A catalyst facilitating this approach should be part of the technical assistance provided&#13;
under APIP. They will be the personnel outlined below. Capacity building will flow from both&#13;
directions: bottom up, from the field and top down, from the bureaucratic hierarchy. Details and&#13;
costing of gender orientation training within the project components and the additional personnel&#13;
required are provided below.&#13;
Recommended Budget&#13;
Personnel&#13;
(a)   One Gender/Community Development (CD) Overall Coordinator&#13;
(b)   (National Local Position) $1,500-2,000/month&#13;
(c)   Five Provincial Community Development Coordinators, one in each of the five&#13;
provinces covered&#13;
(d)   (Provincial Local Position) $800-1000/month&#13;
(e)   Community Development Workers, based on the number of villages and the&#13;
population of each village&#13;
(f)   (District and Village Level) $500-700/month&#13;
&#13;

(g)   One Expatriate Consultant $250-350/day or $3-5,000/month&#13;
The Terms of Reference (TOR) of the Overall Coordinator is included in this report (See Annex&#13;
A).&#13;
Training&#13;
(a)   Materials - budget to be incorporated within each project component&#13;
(b)   Training Allowance, in consistency with the budget in the project components,&#13;
10-15 participants per training, lasting 2-3 days&#13;
(c)   The frequency of the gender orientation training will be consistent with the&#13;
various local training in the project components. It is proposed that gender&#13;
analysis be included in the program, as an introductory orientation.&#13;
Logistics&#13;
8.    The budget for the items below can be a lump sum which would be made available as&#13;
part of the total project cost, s-ecifically allotted to gender costs in each component:&#13;
(a)   Travelling Allowance (Per Diem)&#13;
(b)   Transportation&#13;
(c)   Incidental Expenses&#13;
Specific Suggestions for Each Component:&#13;
(a)   Livestock&#13;
(i)   The design and production of audio-visual materials, already costed in the&#13;
budget, particularly reaching out to the women animal raisers who could&#13;
not read and write, can be shown to villages on scheduled basis through&#13;
extension services.&#13;
(ii)   As mentioned in the above paragraph, the recruitment of female vets&#13;
would need quota, such as 30% of trainees have to be females. This is the&#13;
only way female vets can be increased as far as the present situation is&#13;
concerned.&#13;
(iii)  In the facilitation of credit to poor farmers, and the administration and&#13;
supervision of the development fund for village facilities, attention must&#13;
be given to the participation of women not only as beneficiaries but as&#13;
active decision makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(iv)   Efforts must be made to encourage women to participate in the training&#13;
programs to educate the poor farmers on privatized veterinary services.&#13;
(b)   Hydrology&#13;
(i)   The strengthening of village development committees (VDC's) who are&#13;
the main controllers of irrigation water management and maintenance in&#13;
the village level, can be achieved through community development&#13;
facilitated by the CD workers in coordination with provincial Hydrology&#13;
office.&#13;
(ii)   Gender orientation training can be provided to the village chiefs to make&#13;
them more aware of the constraints faced by female farmers and to avoid&#13;
building in unintended barriers to access in village services, such as&#13;
irrigation water.&#13;
(c)   Agronomy&#13;
(i)    Women farmers must be included in the Farmer Field School (FFS) which&#13;
is an approach to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) developed by FAO.&#13;
A quota of at least 30% will be reasonable.&#13;
(ii)   Efforts must be made in encouraging women farmers to participate in&#13;
educational training programs such as fertilizer administration and&#13;
application. The production of audio-visual materials and other visual&#13;
literature to cater to women farmers who can not read and write, can be&#13;
coordinated through the extension services. (The MAFF Extension Office&#13;
with funding from Australia is planning to build a new building at the&#13;
MAFF grounds, for purposes of producing media and audio-visual&#13;
extension materials and videos.&#13;
(d)   HRM/HRD&#13;
(i)   In the recruitment of trainees in this component, there needs to be a quota&#13;
for women, in similar manner as the quota for village vets trainees under&#13;
the livestock component. The exact percentage can be determined at&#13;
appraisal, after discussion with the government.&#13;
(ii)   Under the Training Needs Assessment (TNA), to find out where there is a&#13;
shortage of "gap" in knowledge and skills needed for implementing the&#13;
project component, women's specific needs must be incorporated in the&#13;
research design.&#13;
(iii)  Gender orientation must be included in the specialized training required&#13;
before Training Coordinators can undertake training needs assessments&#13;
and design training program outlines.&#13;
