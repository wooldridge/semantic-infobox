HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         Government of Guinea&#13;
Implementing      Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Culture&#13;
Agency:           (MESRSC)&#13;
Beneficiaries:    Post-secondary students under the aegis of MESRSC&#13;
Credit Amount:   SDR 4.5 million (US$6.6 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:            Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity&#13;
Financing Plan':  IDA:               US$6.6 million&#13;
Government:       US$0.7 million&#13;
Total:            US$7.4 million&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
&amp; Description:    This operation has been designed to provide support for development and&#13;
implementation of a new policy framework in Guinean higher education,&#13;
and for institutional capacity-building. Activities in support of policy&#13;
development are front-loaded to the first two years of the four-year&#13;
project.  The long-term  objective of the project is to establish a&#13;
reconfigured, streamlined system of higher education and research, with&#13;
greater institutional autonomy, improved cost-effectiveness, and increased&#13;
relevance for economic development. Specific objectives are to help the&#13;
government to: (a) reorganize the Ministry and the institutions of higher&#13;
education based on identified need and resource availability; (b) build&#13;
financial and budget management capacity at the Ministry and&#13;
institutional levels; and (c) establish a viable information and&#13;
communication system. The Ministry will assume a new role focusing on&#13;
quality control, cost-effectiveness and relevance.  This will mean&#13;
overhauling the flow of information, establishing criteria for evaluating&#13;
teaching and learning processes (linking the amount of financing to these&#13;
criteria), and helping the institutions become more academically relevant&#13;
and financially competitive. This approach is seen as a necessary prelude&#13;
to any broader attempt to redefine curricular offerings, etc., or any major&#13;
investment operation, all of which will be undertaken only under a follow-&#13;
up operation to be contingent upon progress realized through this project.&#13;
Slight differences in the amounts may occur due to rounding of figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
The project will:&#13;
1.    Support institutional reorganization by:&#13;
* Financing analysis and reform of university governance, finance,&#13;
management, female participation, student services, user fees and other&#13;
areas in the context of decentralization and institutional autonomy.&#13;
Agendas for the studies and analysis under the first year of the project&#13;
have been developed through a broadly participatory process at each of&#13;
the institutions of higher education and of research; and&#13;
* Financing Ministry-level development of accreditation and evaluation&#13;
procedures.&#13;
2.    Upgrade the information and communication systems by:&#13;
* Overhauling data collection, analysis, and dissemination procedures&#13;
at the central Ministry level;&#13;
* Creating institutional information systems; and&#13;
* Improving communications via installation of a telephone system at&#13;
the University of Conakry, radio communications throughout the sector,&#13;
and Internet connectivity.&#13;
3.    Improve Budgetary Programming and Monitoring by:&#13;
* Supporting Ministry-level financial management, including&#13;
establishment of an internal audit unit and application of competitive&#13;
funding criteria to allocation of institutional grants; and&#13;
* Supporting institution-level financial management, including&#13;
implementation of a computerized accounting system.&#13;
Benefits:         The economic analysis conducted during project preparation focused on&#13;
internal efficiency savings generated by the project.  The external&#13;
benefits of the interventions planned were not quantified because of the&#13;
weakness of the existing data base, a weakness to be addressed under the&#13;
project. Internal savings and new revenues were estimated in four key&#13;
project areas: (i) private resource mobilization, (ii) the opening of&#13;
University social services management to competitive bidding, (iii)&#13;
restriction of scholarships, and (iv) increased productivity of teaching&#13;
and non-teaching personnel.  It was estimated that cost-savings and&#13;
resource mobilization will amount to US$6.4 million over the life of the&#13;
project, and that additional recurrent costs under the project will amount&#13;
to US$1.6 million, for net savings over four years of approximately&#13;
US$4.8 million. Key performance indicators have been included in&#13;
Government's Policy Statement for Higher Education and Research&#13;
(Annex 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
The project will help the Guinean government ensure that future&#13;
investments in the sector are focused on sustainable activities and&#13;
programs that can be shown to have an impact on economic&#13;
development. By introducing cost recovery measures, it obliges the&#13;
sector to initiate demand-driven programs which provide graduates with&#13;
marketable skills.  Through development of criterion-based funding,&#13;
along with accreditation mechanisms, the project provides incentives to&#13;
individual institutions to achieve long overdue cost efficiencies. Along&#13;
with the budgetary targets included in the Government's policy statement&#13;
for higher education, to be monitored throughout the project, this will&#13;
further ensure that the absolute priority given to primary education is&#13;
maintained, and that funds arc freed for the continued expansion of&#13;
primary and secondary education and for improvements in the quality of&#13;
higher education. Recasting the role of the Ministry of Higher Education&#13;
(MESRSC) as one of support and quality control, rather than direct&#13;
management will reduce political tensions throughout the entire sector&#13;
and provide a more stable environment, conducive to the long-term&#13;
sustainability of reform efforts.&#13;
Risks:             The project is low risk. Policy reform measures have been front-loaded&#13;
early in the project cycle to ensure that they remain the focus of&#13;
activities and the subject of the annual and mid-term reviews. The main&#13;
short-term risks include the availability of capable leadership to guide the&#13;
reform process and potential opposition from interest groups (students,&#13;
faculty) that may see themselves as losers in the process; long-term risks&#13;
include the potential failure of Government to provide adequate ongoing&#13;
budgetary support and the converse possibility that increased investments&#13;
in higher education will draw resources away from primary education.&#13;
These risks cannot be entirely eliminated, but they have been addressed&#13;
through the participatory, consensual approach taken to project&#13;
development.   Intensive  budgetary  discussions  were  held  with&#13;
representatives from the Ministry of Pre-University Education&#13;
(MEPUFP) and the Ministry of Higher Education, as well as the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, to ensure agreement on budgetary funding that&#13;
gives a continuing priority to primary education. These agreements are&#13;
included in the policy letters for both ministries and will be a focus of&#13;
annual and mid-term reviews for this project and for the Equity and&#13;
School Improvement Project approved by the Board in May 1995.&#13;

Economic&#13;
Analysis:          Net annual savings from the project would be approximately 1.2 million&#13;
dollars, or just over 4.8 million dollars over the course of the project.&#13;
Of this amount, approximately two-thirds would be reinvested in higher&#13;
education and research and one-third in primary and secondary&#13;
education. The current project was the least cost alternative of the&#13;
various approaches considered.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of Guinea has requested IDA fiancing over four years for a technical&#13;
assistance credit to support the development and initial implementation of a reform program&#13;
for its higher education and research sector. This operation has been designed to provide&#13;
support for development and implementation of a new policy framework in Guinean higher&#13;
education, and for institutional capacity-building. Activities in support of policy development&#13;
are front-loaded to the first two years of the project. This will be the first IDA credit for higher&#13;
education, although a number of policy discussions were held in the context of the recently&#13;
completed Education Sector Adjustment Program (PASE, 1990-1994). It will cover the period&#13;
1995-2000. The project will include support for feasibility studies, management training, and&#13;
improved communications at the five institutions of higher education managed by the Ministere&#13;
de l'Enseignement Superieur, de la Recherche Scientifique, et de la Culture (MESRSC), the&#13;
two principal research institutions, and the central Ministry. A decision will be made at the&#13;
time of the mid-term review regarding a reconfiguration and streamlining of the Ministry, with&#13;
the expected closing of some institutions and programs and the realigning of others.&#13;
1.2   The long-term objective of the project is to establish a reconfigured, streamlined system&#13;
of higher education and research, with greater institutional autonomy, improved cost-&#13;
effectiveness, and increased relevance for economic development. Specific objectives are to&#13;
help the government to: (a) reorganize the Ministry and the institutions of higher education&#13;
based on identified need and resource availability; (b) build financial and budget management&#13;
capacity at the Ministry and institutional levels; and (c) establish a viable information and&#13;
communication system. The Ministry will assume a new role focusing on quality control,&#13;
cost-effectiveness and relevance.  This will mean overhauling the flow of information,&#13;
establishing criteria for evaluating teaching and learning processes (linking the amount of&#13;
financing to these criteria), and helping the institutions become more academically relevant and&#13;
financially competitive. It is seen as a necessary prelude to any broader attempt to redefine&#13;
curricular offerings, etc., or any major investment operation, all of which will be undertaken&#13;
only under a follow-up operation to be contingent upon progress realized through this project.&#13;
1.3   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the&#13;
Board on March 1, 1994. Recognizing the links between education and economic growth, the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy emphasizes the need to build a strong human resource base. It&#13;
calls for higher education reform "in light of severe shortcomings in the adequacy of higher&#13;
education training vis-a-vis economic development needs and high unit costs." IDA has taken&#13;
the initiative at the pre-university level of ensuring that donors have worked at high levels of&#13;
collaboration with one another and with Government, ensuring that sectoral investments and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
donor coordination occur within a supportive policy environment. This project will extend the&#13;
collaborative approach to higher education and will strengthen ongoing Bank support for&#13;
improving policy articulation and resource allocation. The project will be the fifth IDA-&#13;
financed operation for educational development in Guinea.  It will be implemented&#13;
simultaneously with the Equity and School Improvement Project (Cr.2719-GUI), and builds on&#13;
lessons learned through the Education Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2155-GUI, 1990-94), an&#13;
Education Project (Cr. 849-GUI, 1978-84) and a Second Education Project (Cr. 1341-GUI,&#13;
1983-90).&#13;
1.4   The proposed IDA credit of US$6.6 million will finance 90% of the total program cost,&#13;
including 100% of the foreign exchange cost (US$3.4 million equivalent) and 91 % of the local&#13;
cost (US$3.3 million equivalent).  Total program  cost is estimated at US$7.4 million&#13;
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$3.4 million equivalent. Guinea (the&#13;
Government) will finance 10% of the program cost, including 9% of local cost (US$0.3&#13;
million equivalent), plus taxes and duties (US$0.4 million equivalent).&#13;
2. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1   Guinea is a country with 6.2 million inhabitants and a high population growth of 2.8%&#13;
per year (1993). It has long been one of Africa's most conspicuous underachievers. Guinea&#13;
has one of the highest concentrations of mineral resources in Africa (bauxite, diamond and&#13;
gold) and a high agricultural potential. The mining sector accounts for 22% of GDP,&#13;
agriculture for less than 30%. Yet Guinea's per capita income is only US$537, with low social&#13;
indicators such as life expectancy (44 years), infant mortality (133 per 1,000 live births) and&#13;
illiteracy (76%).&#13;
B. Economic Developments&#13;
2.2   Since the beginning of 1986, the Government of Guinea has been implementing an&#13;
ambitious program of economic and financial reform. IDA and the IMF supported the&#13;
adjustment through a SAL I (1986) and two stand-by arrangements in 1986 and 1987. This&#13;
program was aimed at improving the incentive framework for private sector development&#13;
(including the health sector), phasing out state involvement in commercial enterprises,&#13;
instituting better management of the administration (including a reduction in the size of the&#13;
civil service) and developing a strong human resource base. The reform program has resulted&#13;
in a full transition from a command to a market economy, increases in non-mining revenues,&#13;
the privatization or liquidation of a large number of public enterprises, and a comprehensive&#13;
reform of and reduction in the size of the public administration from 95,000 to 52,000&#13;
individuals. While progress in the first phase of the adjustment program was encouraging,&#13;
some of the more difficult institution-building and politically sensitive reforms of the second&#13;
phase have not been implemented at the rhythm anticipated. Consequently, the reform process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
has slowed, with some key measures remaining to be taken. A SAL II was approved by IDA&#13;
in August 1988. Since July 1994, Guinea is implementing the second year program of an&#13;
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility arrangement approved by the IMF in November&#13;
1991, suspended in early 1992 and replaced by a shadow program until June 1994. Overall,&#13;
the Government's program has resulted in real economic growth, averaging 3.8% per annum&#13;
from 1987-1992, an increase in real per capita income of about 1 % per annum.&#13;

2.3   Structure. The educational system consists of six years of primary schooling, a four-&#13;
year cycle for lower secondary and vocational training, a three-year upper secondary cycle,&#13;
and five years of tertiary education. There is no upper secondary vocational training, but there&#13;
are a number of post-secondary vocational programs of varying length run by a wide range of&#13;
sectoral ministries. During the 1993-94 school year, Guinea's pre-university educational&#13;
system accommodated 589,000 students, with 471,000 students in primary school, 109,900&#13;
students in secondary school, and 8,100 students in technical schools. The higher education&#13;
system accommodated 8,104 students. The total number of teaching staff during the 1993-94&#13;
school year for the primary and secondary levels was 14,800 as compared to 786 full-time&#13;
professors in the higher education system.&#13;
2.4   Administration.  The sector is managed by two separate ministries--one for pre-&#13;
university and vocational education (Ministere de l'Enseignement Pre-Universitaire et de la&#13;
Formation Professionnelle [MEPUFP1) and another for higher education and research (Ministere&#13;
de I'Enseignement Superieur, de la Recherche Scientifique, et de la Culture /MESRSCJ). The&#13;
MEPUFP directs all pre-university structures through eight regional Academic Inspectorates&#13;
which in turn administer 38 prefectoral-level Directorates of Education (Direction prefectorale&#13;
de I'education, DPE) and 210 sub-prefectoral Pedagogic Delegates. Significant progress has&#13;
been evident in the past few years for the programs managed by MEPUFP. Under the&#13;
Education Sector Adjustment Program, primary school enrollments increased by over 70%&#13;
during the period 1991-1994. Pre-university budgeting processes and financial management&#13;
procedures were greatly strengthened. A highly successful redeployment of 2200 underutilized&#13;
secondary school teachers and administrative personnel to primary school classrooms took&#13;
place in 1992-1993. Yet if the sector is showing much greater signs of health at the primary&#13;
and secondary levels, similar improvements have not occurred for higher education, where key&#13;
indicators continue to deteriorate. Reforms in 1984 moved the subsector away from a heavy&#13;
focus on agricultural training but did not result in desired improvements to quality and&#13;
relevance. The percentage of female students in higher education declined from 19% in 1984&#13;
to under 6% by 1993. The sector has been plagued by student strikes and low quality. This&#13;
comes against the backdrop of a weakening macroeconomic framework and the Finance&#13;
Ministry's recent record of sporadic disbursements to the sector.&#13;
2.5   The MESRSC is responsible for the two Guinean universities (the University of&#13;
Conakry [UGANC] and the University of Kankan [UJNK], three specialized institutes (the&#13;
Teacher Training Institute in Maneah, the Giscard d'Estaing Agriculture and Veterinary&#13;
Institute in Faranah, and the Mining and Geology Institute in Boke) and a number of scientific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
research centers. Management of these institutions is highly fragmented. The respective&#13;
responsibilities of the Ministry and the institutions have been ill-defined, with a great deal of&#13;
overlap, resulting in conflict and organizational inertia. This has contributed to a precipitous&#13;
decline in educational quality and the relevance of course content. The situation has been&#13;
further aggravated by the total lack of communications capacity within the sector, and the&#13;
absence of reliable statistical data. In an attempt to resolve the ongoing management and&#13;
pedagogic crises, the Government decided in 1993 to grant greater autonomy to the&#13;
institutions. This decision has been only partially implemented because of limited financial&#13;
and educational management capacity and because the type and degree of autonomy to be&#13;
granted was not clearly defined. During the preparation of the proposed project, a number of&#13;
working sessions have been held in order to frame these issues, and a clear statement of policy&#13;
has been prepared.  This policy highlights the development of management capacity,&#13;
information flow procedures, and cost-effectiveness. It calls for a new and clear division of&#13;
responsibilities between Ministry and institutional personnel, with the Ministry assuming&#13;
responsibility for coordination and quality control and the institutions taking responsibility for&#13;
management of personnel, finances, program development and institutional development. The&#13;
Government and the institutions have expressed their commitment to early implementation of&#13;
the new policy.&#13;
2.6   The institutional framework. Until 1984, higher education in Guinea was dominated&#13;
by more than 40 post-secondary agricultural training schools accounting for over 50% of all&#13;
students. Far-reaching reforms in 1984 left only fifteen post-secondary institutions in Guinea.&#13;
Ten of these are technical training schools, overseen by four different ministries. There are&#13;
five institutions run by the Ministry of Higher Education (Ministere de I'Enseignement&#13;
Superieur, de la Recherche Scientifique, et de la Culture--MESRSC): (i) the University of&#13;
Conakry (Universite Gamal Abdel Nasser de Conakry--UGANC) is by far the largest&#13;
institution, with just under 6000 students and 600 teaching staff. It consists of four faculties&#13;
(science, letters and humanities, medicine and pharmacy, and economics and law) and one&#13;
polytechnic institute with five engineering departments. It has no telephones and few&#13;
computers; (ii) the University of Kankan (Universite Julius Nyerere de Kankan--UJNK) has&#13;
about 1200 students, with about 100 teaching staff. It consists of two faculties (natural science&#13;
and social science);  (iii) the Teacher Training Institute of Guinea (Institut Superieur des&#13;
Sciences de l'Education en Guinee--ISSEG) has a variable enrollment ranging from 125 to 400&#13;
students or more, depending on training needs. It has 50 teachers; (iv) the Agriculture and&#13;
Veterinary Institute of Faranah (Institut Superieur Agronomique et Veterinaire--Valery Giscard&#13;
d'Estaing--ISA V) had 111 teachers and 161 students in 1992--enrollment has since increased to&#13;
about 250 students; (v) the Mining and Geology Institute of Boke (Institut Superieur des&#13;
Mines et Geologie--ISMG) has 29 full-time teachers. It produced 16 graduates in 1993. Its&#13;
enrollment is near 250. In addition to these schools, MESRSC runs two major centers for&#13;
research and development: the Research Center of Conakry-Rogbane (Centre de Recherche de&#13;
Conakry-Rogbane--CERESCOR), which conducts research in oceanography and civil&#13;
engineering, and the Guinean Institute for Research and Applied Biology (Institut de Recherche&#13;
et de Biologie Appliquee de Guinee--IRBAG) which conducts research in medical biology&#13;
(transmissible diseases, epidemiological monitoring, etc.) and zoology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.7   None of these institutions is running an effective program at present.  With the&#13;
exception of the Teacher Training Institute, for which new facilities are being built with FED&#13;
financing, the physical infrastructure is everywhere in poor condition. Many programs have&#13;
little relevance for the country's economic development and most are severely underfunded.&#13;
Several are overstaffed while others suffer from staff shortages. Activities in the research&#13;
institutions often overlap research activities in the teaching institutions, with little effort at&#13;
coordination.  In 1994, limited autonomy was granted to these institutions although the&#13;
operational meaning of this autonomy was left largely undefined. In its policy statement for&#13;
higher education and research, submitted to IDA in draft form as a condition of negotiations&#13;
[para. 7.1 (a)], the Government recognizes these weaknesses and affirms its intent to make&#13;
fundamental changes in the way the sector is structured, including redeployment and more&#13;
effective use of teachers, cost recovery, limits to student enrollment, and improvements in&#13;
quality.&#13;
2.8   The Guinea Higher Education Management Support Project (PADES) is a technical&#13;
assistance project designed to help the higher education and research sector establish the&#13;
framework for more responsive and cost-effective programs in these institutions.  While&#13;
primary education will remain the clear priority of Government for the sector, as evidenced by&#13;
the Guinea Equity and School Improvement Project, the current initiative will enable higher&#13;
education to be an effective and efficient contributor to the country's economic development.&#13;
It will do this by strengthening the management capacity of the institutions of higher education&#13;
and research, re-orienting institutional goals, programns and resources according to&#13;
development priorities, increasing cost-effectiveness, and creating a new quality control role&#13;
for the central Ministry.&#13;
2.9   The proposed project is process-oriented, designed to ensure government ownership of&#13;
the reform process as recommended in the Guinea Higher Education and Research Sector&#13;
Report (May 1993). It will enhance overall planning capacity and rationalize the budgetary&#13;
process, re-orienting spending toward quality-enhancing inputs and away from social transfers&#13;
and administrative overhead. During the course of project preparation, there has been a&#13;
significant shift in spending in the education sector from higher education to primary and&#13;
secondary education. Higher education's share of the recurrent education budget has moved&#13;
from 29% in 1990 to 21% in 1992 and 17.5% in 1995. It is expected that higher education's&#13;
share of the education budget will stabilize at 17% in the short term, and remain in the range&#13;
of 17-20% in the medium term, as Guinea continues a major thrust to improve the quality and&#13;
coverage of primary and lower secondary education. This is below the sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
average for higher education of about 22% and makes it all the more important that national&#13;
priorities be established and that programs be implemented efficiently. The project will&#13;
capitalize on the expressed desire of the stakeholders in higher education to significantly alter&#13;
the structure of higher education and to engage in major pedagogical changes. This first step in&#13;
the process of comprehensive reform is seen as a necessary pre-requisite to future capital&#13;
investments.&#13;
2.10  The existing framework for higher education in Guinea has proven to be unsatisfactory.&#13;
Resource allocation is skewed; quality, efficiency and equity are far too low and overhead&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
costs and waste are far too high. Fewer than 6% of university students are female. There is&#13;
little contact between personnel of the various institutions and relationships with the Ministry&#13;
have often been unproductive: highly skilled manpower is not available, research relevant to&#13;
the economic needs of the country is not carried out or, if it is, cannot be communicated to&#13;
potential users. The system is widely perceived as being out of touch with its economic and&#13;
social environment, with many programs irrelevant to Guinea's development needs, and little&#13;
evidence of the flexibility needed to respond to changing conditions. Reversing the current&#13;
trend of deterioration and declining relevance will require fundamental changes in funding,&#13;
programns and management, including: (i) initiation of user fees; (ii) curtailing of scholarships;&#13;
(iii) full privatization of cafeteria services on a competitive basis (a process which is already&#13;
under way); (iv) significant increases in professors' work schedules and reductions in overtime&#13;
payments; and (v) additional investments in infrastructure and materials to improve priority&#13;
programs, as well as laboratory services, library services, communications, computerization,&#13;
and information management.&#13;
2. 11  The policy environment.  According to the 1993 World Bank report, "Higher&#13;
education in Guinea has been characterized by wild policy gyrations over the past two decades,&#13;
and has gone from a period of explosive, uncontrolled expansion to one of cutbacks and&#13;
physical deterioration". This has occurred in a context of physical and intellectual isolation.&#13;
The institutions within the system are currently unable to communicate directly with one&#13;
another, with the Ministry of Higher Education, or with external sources, and there is no&#13;
mechanism for routine consultations and exchanges. Furthermore, the sector is beset with&#13;
many of the problems faced by higher education and research institutions in neighboring&#13;
countries: skewed budget allocations, inadequate levels of non-salary operating funds, poor&#13;
teaching, deteriorating physical plants, etc.&#13;
2.12 Management responsibility has been divided among the MESRSC and the various&#13;
institutions in ways that have led to overlap in functions and considerable inefficiency and&#13;
delay. Until recently, few important decisions have been made at the institutional level,&#13;
including those relating to student intake and faculty composition.  The result has been&#13;
overcrowding and underfunding, with the buildup of large internal arrears for food purchases,&#13;
equipment, and supplies.  In 1994, the sector implemented for the first time legal and&#13;
administrative texts for granting institutional autonomy;  the policy statement for higher&#13;
education and research, the first draft of which was prepared in 1994, provides the&#13;
Government's overall vision for the sector and creates a framework for developing new&#13;
operational agreements between the institutions and the Ministry. The recent decision of the&#13;
government to provide the institutions with greater functional autonomy is potentially a&#13;
watershed in the development of the sector. However, even if a greater degree of autonomy is&#13;
achieved, this in itself is no guarantee of greater relevance or indeed, of less isolation. The&#13;
specifics of that decision have not been worked out. In particular, the mechanisms that will&#13;
enable institutions to recover costs and to disburse funds according to their own priorities have&#13;
not yet been identified. In addition, if higher education is to become less isolated and more&#13;
relevant, the relationship between higher education and its clients must be changed. This&#13;
essentially means that the administrative structure and procedures must change. The thrust of&#13;
that change can be described as involving a shift from "administration" carried out by a central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Ministry to "management" carried out at the appropriate level: national for coordination and&#13;
quality control, institutional for personnel, pedagogy, program planning, etc. Agreement with&#13;
IDA on the final version of the Government's policy statement for higher education and&#13;
research, including monitorable performance criteria and a policy reform agenda, was reached&#13;
during negotiations [para. 7.2 (a)].&#13;
2.13 Sector development issues. Sector work conducted by the World Bank in 1993&#13;
identified a number of issues crucial to the development of higher education in Guinea,&#13;
including the low relevance of current programs to economic development, the quality of&#13;
teaching personnel, low internal efficiency (only 27% of entering students ultimately complete&#13;
the undergraduate cycle), and equity of access. The study found, for instance, that the&#13;
percentage of female students in higher education had dropped from 19% in 1978 to 6% in&#13;
1992.  It also found that rural students were from five to ten times less likely to enter&#13;
university than urban students.&#13;
2.14 Budgetary and financial issues. Under the Education Sector Adjustment Program,&#13;
overall education expenditures moved from 12% of total public expenditure in the late 1980's&#13;
to approximately 22% in the early 1990's, a level at which it has stabilized. The share of&#13;
higher education in the overall education expenditures dropped from 29% in 1990 to 21% in&#13;
1992 and 17.5% in 1995. However, the absolute level of funding for higher education has&#13;
more than doubled in the 1990's. Unit recurrent costs increased from US$1,136 in 1982 to&#13;
US$1,849 in 1990, before dropping to US$1,420 in 1994. This remains almost 50% below&#13;
francophone Africa averages, but relatively close to overall sub-Saharan Africa averages&#13;
(which plummeted from US$6,300 per student in 1980 to US$1,500 in 1988, a level at which&#13;
it has stabilized). Student scholarships in 1995 accounted for approximately 34% of costs&#13;
(reliable data are not available for earlier years). Due to persistent budget shortfalls, non-&#13;
salary operating expenditures are extremely low, and always considerably less than called for&#13;
in the budget, with a gap between scheduled and actual disbursement that is often more than&#13;
six months. Salaries and scholarships, on the other hand, are paid in full in a timely fashion,&#13;
although with considerable waste. Payment of overtime salaries to teachers continues to&#13;
consume an inordinate portion of the budget, in spite of the relatively low number of hours&#13;
taught by most teachers.  The Government's policy statement for higher education and&#13;
research proposes reforms in each of these areas. An arrete-ministeriel already published sets&#13;
the number of teaching hours per week at ten for full and associate professors, and at twelve&#13;
for assistant professors and instructors. Prior to October 31, 1995, the Ministry will publish&#13;
an arr&amp;e-rministeriel acceptable to IDA establishing equivalencies for supervising labs (two&#13;
hours of lab supervision to be equivalent to one hour of teaching) and small-group mentoring&#13;
(one-and-one-half hours to be the equivalent of one hour of teaching).&#13;
2.15 Managing the change process. It is likely that an internally more efficient system will&#13;
make it possible to improve quality at little additional cost, yet in order to address the issues of&#13;
what changes should be made (size of enrollment, program offerings, etc.), meaningful&#13;
participation in the change process on the part of all key actors is needed. The same general&#13;
principle applies to research institutions. Through this process, a higher education sector will&#13;
emerge capable of responding to the sorts of new demands that will be placed on it in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
foreseeable future (such as, for instance, the need for municipal workers that will come from&#13;
the proposed decentralization of Government structures). While the level of discourse about&#13;
change within the sector has increased considerably in recent years, the sector has not&#13;
demonstrated the capacity to reform itself. The Higher Education Management Support&#13;
Project will help establish this capacity, creating both a structure and sufficient time for&#13;
developing internal feedback, external input and appropriate decision-making processes. It will&#13;
provide support both for individual institutions as they define decentralized administrative&#13;
structures and for the central Ministry as it designs and implements a new quality control and&#13;
sectoral planning function. It will pay attention to communication issues and provide an&#13;
environment in which national consensus can be developed. In this sense, it will function as a&#13;
bridge across which innovative ideas can flow.&#13;
2.16 Donor coordination. The change process supported by this project will include the&#13;
active involvement of several donors already involved in the higher education subsector.&#13;
Current donor programs have largely been developed independently;  the newly created&#13;
sectoral steering committee will work to foster a policy dialogue with all active donors, and to&#13;
ensure coherence of programs and policies. The French Ministry of Cooperation and the&#13;
European Development Fund (FED) have provided technical assistance over the past six to&#13;
seven years in support of undergraduate programs in mathematics, physics, computer science&#13;
and social science at the University of Conakry and at the Teacher Training Institute at&#13;
Maneah. Germany (G7Z) is developing a soil mechanics program at the University of&#13;
Conakry, while ACDI is financing a master's program in management and a center for&#13;
environmental studies. USAID is funding a small Human Rights Library. The FED is&#13;
currently financing the construction of new facilities for the Teacher Training Institute and&#13;
improving the cafeteria facilities of the University of Kankan. The UNDP funds the return of&#13;
expatriate nationals abroad with technical expertise to teach at the university for various&#13;
periods of time.&#13;
2.17 Many broad institutional and political issues that exceed the authority of the MESRSC,&#13;
such as the financial procedures necessary to ensure that the formal autonomy granted to&#13;
institutions by Government become operational, have been identified. Others will be identified&#13;
by the various working groups, or task forces, over the course of the project. Rather than&#13;
attempt to define ideal procedures ahead of time, latitude will be given within the project for&#13;
negotiations with representatives of the Ministries of Plan, Finance, and Administrative&#13;
Reform, and other Government entities as appropriate, so that new procedures for the timely&#13;
disbursement of budgetary allocations, teacher recruitment, etc. may be developed.&#13;
D. Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
2.18 The Higher Education Management Project will be the fifth IDA-financed education&#13;
project in Guinea. The first project (1978-84) focused on developing vocational training&#13;
capacity and equipping the Planning Office of the Ministry of Education and the Project&#13;
Management Unit. The Project Performance Audit Report (#6492-GUI) recommended that&#13;
future projects concentrate on addressing a narrow range of issues within the sector. In spite&#13;
of this, the second IDA-financed education credit (1983-1990) financed a wide range of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
activities including vocational training, manpower development, education planning, and&#13;
primary school improvement. According to the Project Completion Report (#10200-GUI), the&#13;
high number of donors (three) and local actors made the project too complex for existing&#13;
management capability. The main recommendation was that project design and organization&#13;
be adapted to the existing institutional, economic, managerial, and implementation capacities.&#13;
Ironically, the first two credits met most of their quantitative goals but did not have a major&#13;
impact on the sector, where virtually all indicators of access and quality were in free fall. The&#13;
failure to achieve a broader impact is largely attributable to the lack of policy dialogue.&#13;
2.19 The third intervention in the sector, the PASE (1990-94), set out to reverse the decline&#13;
in educational access and quality by first strengthening institutional and management capacity.&#13;
Government developed a ten-year strategic design covering the total education sector, with&#13;
explicit attention to the macroeconomic context. Although it was initially intended that higher&#13;
education reform be included in the range of issues considered under the PASE, when higher&#13;
education and pre-university education were split under separate ministries in 1992,&#13;
collaboration became increasingly difficult and this goal was not met. The PASE did succeed&#13;
in reversing the declining enrollment trends of the 1980s for primary schooling, however.&#13;
This was made possible through: (a) an ambitious school construction program supported by&#13;
community groups, NGOs and donors, accompanied by development and implementation of&#13;
low-cost construction norms; (b) West Africa's most ambitious redeployment program to date,&#13;
with over 2,200 teachers shifted from administrative posts and secondary schools to primary&#13;
school classrooms; and (c) a reallocation of budgetary resources in favor of the education&#13;
sector, including large increases in non-salary operating expenditures.  In line with&#13;
Government-wide civil service reform measures, the MEPUFP has overhauled its teacher&#13;
management procedures. Data collection and analysis have been dramatically improved.&#13;
Government support for education has increased from 13% (1989) to 26% (1993) of the&#13;
national budget, with marked improvements in preparation and monitoring of education sector&#13;
budgets. The sectoral budget distribution moved from 32% for primary education in 1990 to&#13;
35% in 1993; expenditures for non-salary operating costs increased from 2% of pre-university&#13;
expenditures in 1990 to 15% in 1993.&#13;
2.20 The key lesson to be learned from implementation of the PASE is that a complex range&#13;
of interventions can be successfully undertaken, provided that they are situated within a&#13;
coherent policy matrix and given intensive supervision. The PASE also demonstrated the&#13;
importance of a long-term framework for education system support. A similar long-term&#13;
perspective will need to be developed for higher education, covering ten to fifteen years.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   The project will provide support for policy reform and for capacity-building. Activities&#13;
in support of policy reform will take place over the first two years of the project, at which&#13;
time agreement will be reached on implementation of a detailed policy agenda; capacity-&#13;
building initiatives will be spread over four years.  The project consists of three major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
components:   (a)  institutional reorganization,  (b)  development of an  information  and&#13;
communication system, and (c) establishment of budgetary programming and monitoring capacities.&#13;
It will be executed over a four-year project, following an agreed schedule of implementation subject&#13;
to annual review. A mid-term review will pay particular attention to the success achieved in&#13;
implementing policy reforms. For all project components, planned activities are premised on the&#13;
creation of a process of reflection and consensus-building to be followed by the re-design of&#13;
existing organizational relationships and structures. All components reflect the fact that individual&#13;
institutions exhibit differing capacities for change and are currently at different levels of&#13;
development. Operational details for each project component are provided below.&#13;
A. Objectives and Scope&#13;
3.2    The purpose of this operation is to provide a framework for the rationalization of&#13;
higher education in Guinea. Its long-term objective will be to establish a reconfigured,&#13;
streamlined system with greater institutional autonomy, improved cost-effectiveness, and&#13;
increased relevance for economic development. This will be done by helping the Government&#13;
to design and implement a process of policy reform and institutional capacity-building.&#13;
Specific objectives are to help the Government to: (a) re-organize the Ministry and the&#13;
institutions of higher education based on identified need and resource availability; (b) build&#13;
financial and budget management capacity at the Ministry and institutional levels; and (c)&#13;
establish a viable information and communication system. The Ministry will assume a new&#13;
role focusing on the control of quality, cost-effectiveness and relevance. This will mean&#13;
overhauling the flow of information, establishing criteria for evaluating teaching and learning&#13;
processes (linking the amount of financing to these criteria), and helping the institutions&#13;
become more academically relevant and financially competitive. This approach is seen as a&#13;
necessary prelude to any broader attempt to redefine curricular offerings, etc., or any major&#13;
investment operation, all of which will be reserved for a follow-up operation to be contingent&#13;
upon progress realized through this project.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.3    The project components are summarized below:&#13;
Project Summary (Total Cost US$7.4 million)a&#13;
1. Institutional Reorganization (US$3.6 million)&#13;
* Analysis and reform of university governance, finance, management, female participation, student services,&#13;
and user fees; consultant support for a collaborative process to reconfigure the higher education sector,&#13;
prepare new recruitment criteria and procedures, develop accreditation procedures, and redefine&#13;
administrative responsibilities (US$3.6 million);&#13;
2. Information and Communication System (US$2.0 million)&#13;
*  Improved data collection, analysis, and dissemination (US$0.5 million);&#13;
*  Upgraded institutional information systems (US$0.7 million);&#13;
*  Improved communications (US$0.8 million);&#13;
3. Budgetary Programming and Monitoring (US$1.1 million)&#13;
*  Support for Ministry-level financial management (US$0.5 million);&#13;
*  Support for institution-level financial management (US$0.6 million).&#13;
a/ Includes taxes and dudes, base costs, contingencies and 3 PPF advances totaling US$640,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
1. Institutional Reorganization (US$3.6 million)&#13;
3.4   Scope and objectives.  Administrative procedures in the past have provided for a&#13;
highly-centralized Ministry where the directorates for higher education and scientific research&#13;
held responsibility for supervising most of the activities of the various institutions. The&#13;
institutions retained control over most curricular issues but did not effectively control&#13;
enrollments or personnel recruitment. A move toward greater delegation of responsibilities to&#13;
the institutional level has already begun but little attention has been given to the operational&#13;
details of decentralization. This failing will be addressed through the project.&#13;
3.5   Ten broadly representative working groups have been established within the institutions&#13;
of higher education, the research centers, and the Ministry.  Representatives of these&#13;
institutions and departments form a sectoral steering committee that ensures that an overall&#13;
vision of the sector drives the reform process and linking decision-making processes with field&#13;
experiences. The steering committee is chaired by the Secretary-General of MESRSC who is&#13;
delegated by the Minister of Higher Education for this purpose.   There is also an&#13;
interministerial committee whose role is to ensure coherence between sectoral policies and&#13;
national priorities for economic and social development.  The interministerial committee&#13;
includes the Ministry of Plan and Cooperation which chairs the committee, three&#13;
representatives of the MESRSC, a representative of the MEPUFP, and a representative of the&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. These two committees receive technical and logistic support from the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit located in the MESRSC, which is responsible for daily operations.&#13;
The working groups have prepared initial statements of mission objectives and detailed study&#13;
agendas with terms of reference for the first year of the project. The study agendas, appraised&#13;
in June 1994 (see Annexes 2 and 6), call for a participative approach to the issues confronting&#13;
the sector. Draft terms of reference for consultant services and studies for the first year of the&#13;
project were submitted to IDA as a condition of negotiations [para. 7.1 (b)]. These emphasize&#13;
institutional appropriation of skills and study design. Agreement on these terms of reference&#13;
was reached during negotiations [para. 7.2 (b)].&#13;
3.6   The study agendas can be divided into two large categories: Ministry and institutional.&#13;
Ministry-level studies will focus on the operational aspects of shifting toward a role of quality&#13;
control. This will include establishment of guidelines to evaluate and accredit existing and&#13;
future programs of higher education and development of competitive funding criteria as a basis&#13;
for allocation of resources. For the Directorate for National Research, it will involve a move&#13;
towards a new role as a clearinghouse for research information. At the institutional level,&#13;
studies will focus on developing structures and procedures in support of decentralization and&#13;
increased operational autonomy. In-depth background studies will be conducted in the areas of&#13;
university governance, finance, management, female participation, student services, user fees,&#13;
etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.7   Annual study agendas will be submitted for joint approval by the steering committee&#13;
and IDA on a competitive basis throughout the life of the project. Mission statements will be&#13;
refined annually based on project findings and working group consensus. The study process&#13;
will have as an explicit outcome objective the redesign of flow charts, new recruitment criteria&#13;
and procedures, and the redefinition of administrative responsibilities. Activities in support of&#13;
policy reform will take place over the first two years of the project; capacity building&#13;
initiatives will be spread out over four years. A matrix of policy reforms is included in Annex&#13;
4. Specific reforms will be implemented in accordance with an overall schedule included in&#13;
the policy statement for higher education and research. A comprehensive assessment of the&#13;
progress achieved in the carrying out of the project (including the reform measures agreed&#13;
upon) will be carried out at the mid-term review to be held by December 1997. Financing&#13;
includes provision for training activities.&#13;
3.8   As coherent mission statements are refined at the institutional level, the next phase of&#13;
the project will involve the updating of viable national goals for higher education and research.&#13;
The initial drafting of these goals will be the responsibility of the steering committee. This&#13;
group will serve an overall role as the agent of reform and will act as a knowledgeable&#13;
intermediary between the various institutions' aspirations, national needs, and institutional&#13;
capacities. The plan it produces will include recommendations for the structure of higher&#13;
education, recruitment and personnel management procedures, information sharing, admission&#13;
and scholarship criteria, program priorities, cost recovery, etc.&#13;
3.9   Project implementation will be coordinated through a Project Coordination Unit (PCU),&#13;
comprising a project coordinator, a treasurer, an operational assistant and other staff to be&#13;
agreed with IDA. Terms of reference for the project coordinator, the treasurer and the&#13;
operational assistant were agreed during project preparation and will be subject to annual&#13;
review.&#13;
3.10 Project support. Under the project support will be given for: (a) training central and&#13;
institutional personnel for development and application of accreditation procedures,&#13;
competitive funding criteria, and program evaluation; (b) computer equipment and materials&#13;
for statistical analyses, tracer studies, and personnel management; (c) studies, including both&#13;
national (250 person-months) and international (42 person-months) technical assistance, and&#13;
(d) incremental operating costs (project administration).&#13;
2. Information and Communication System (US$2.0 million)&#13;
3.11  Scope and objectives. The sustainability of reforms to improve quality and relevance&#13;
requires the existence of viable systems of communication among stakeholders, and unimpeded&#13;
flows of information. Three sub-components are included to this end. First, support will be&#13;
given for broad, sector-wide data collection, analysis and dissemination to be handled by a&#13;
newly configured central statistic unit.  Second, decentralized information needs at the&#13;
institutional level will be defined, with training and equipment tailored to institution-specific&#13;
priorities. Support will be given for adaptation of existing software for tracking student flows,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
teaching loads, class schedules and other localized information needs. Third, support will be&#13;
given for significant improvements in communications infrastructure. This support has been&#13;
designed in such a way that while all existing institutions will benefit in the short term from&#13;
the project, and viable information and communication systems will be introduced at all&#13;
institutions, significant investments in infrastructure will be made only at the University of&#13;
Conakry. This will avoid the possible waste of resources in other institutions that could&#13;
ultimately be closed or reconfigured.&#13;
(a) Improved data collection, analysis, and dissemination (US$0.5 million)&#13;
3.12 Data processing functions are currently split between two separate entities within the&#13;
Ministry, neither of which has training or equipment, with the effect that annual statistical&#13;
reports and other vital information are simply not being produced. There is no centralized data&#13;
base for research and analysis, although some of the institutions produce ad hoc enrollment&#13;
figures and faculty lists of widely varying format and quality. Under this component, the two&#13;
units within the Ministry currently responsible for data collection and processing will be&#13;
merged, and the flow of information to and from the institutions of higher education and&#13;
research will be restructured. The component will be overseen by the central MESRSC&#13;
working group, with input from the steering committee. The streamlined central unit will&#13;
design data collection protocols and prototype yearbooks and databases, and will serve as a&#13;
clearinghouse for infonnation. The new focus of the central unit will be on dissemination of&#13;
operationally relevant data as a basis for financing, and to inform the policy dialogue regarding&#13;
program offerings and curriculum content. Institutional units will provide support for initial&#13;
data collection and end-use analysis. The project will build on a study of existing and needed&#13;
capacity conducted during project preparation. It will finance the design of short-term, on-site&#13;
training programs, and the purchase of computer equipment. Wherever possible, collaborative&#13;
approaches with the pre-university school statistics unit will be developed and information&#13;
technology norms will be shared. The project will also carry out a feasibility study to&#13;
determine how information could best be shared among institutions. Statistical information&#13;
tracked will include personnel lists and files, student enrollment and throughput, monitoring of&#13;
equipment and supplies, and maintenance and upkeep schedules.&#13;
3.13  Project support. Under the project, support will be given for: (a) in-service training of&#13;
central Ministry persormel in use of software packages, database management, development of data&#13;
collection protocols and norms, etc., (b) purchase of computer equipment, software and materials,&#13;
(c) national (24 person-months) and international (4 person-months) technical assistance, and (d)&#13;
incremental operating costs for preparation of data collection protocols and prototype yearbooks and&#13;
databases.&#13;
(b) Upgraded institutional information systems (US$0.7 million)&#13;
3.14 In order to manage student flows in a coherent fashion, and to make rational decisions&#13;
about internal resource allocation, individual institutions require current information about&#13;
student performance and characteristics, teachers' career development, class loads and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
schedules, course offerings, library holdings, etc. A preliminary study of institutional needs&#13;
was conducted at all institutions, with recommendations for software design. It was agreed&#13;
that the institutions will collaborate in development of information systems that will be&#13;
compatible across institutions in order to permit sector-wide tracking of enrollments,&#13;
expenditures and programs, and to facilitate the easy exchange of information. These systems&#13;
will also serve as the basis for allocation of criterion-driven recurrent and investment funding.&#13;
This component will be overseen by the steering committee, with delegation of responsibility&#13;
to the institutional working groups as appropriate. It will include funding for training and&#13;
equipment purchase, as well as technical assistance for training in software use.&#13;
3.15  Project support. Under the project support will be given for: (a) in-service training for&#13;
institution-level personnel in use of software packages, (b) computer equipment, software, and&#13;
materials, (c) technical assistance for adapting a software package, and (d) incremental operating&#13;
costs for preparing and piloting the information systems.&#13;
(c) Improved communications (US$0.8 million)&#13;
3.16 Internal reorganization will not bring an end to the intellectual isolation of Guinean&#13;
higher education and research without a means for adequate communication. To this end, the&#13;
project will finance the following initiatives: (a) installation of a campus telephone system for&#13;
the University of Conakry, with several external lines, (b) purchase of radio communications&#13;
equipment for institutions not linked by telephone, and (c) installation of electronic data&#13;
communication, including email, through the Internet. Internet connectivity at the University&#13;
of Conakry was established during project preparation. Since the university has no telephones,&#13;
a radio modem link was installed. This electronic communication system is being developed&#13;
jointly with the Ministry of Pre-University Education and Vocational Training (MEPUFP). It&#13;
is expected that responsibility for ongoing user service and expansion of internal networks to&#13;
connect all sectors throughout the country will ultimately be assigned to a non-governmental&#13;
organization, but the university will maintain responsibility for assuring the technological&#13;
integrity of the system. Each of these activities will be accompanied by training initiatives.&#13;
3.17  Project support.  Under the project support will be given for:  (a) installation of a&#13;
telephone system at the University of Conakry, (b) purchase of radio communications equipment,&#13;
(c) installation of electronic data communication and e-mail, (d) technical assistance, and (e)&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;
3. Budgetary Programming and Monitoring (US$1.1 million)&#13;
3.18  Scope and objectives. At present, the investment and recurrent budgets for higher&#13;
education are prepared by the central Ministry DAAF based on administrative concerns rather&#13;
than developmental priorities. Requests for additional resources are made independent from&#13;
considerations relating to the effectiveness of existing resource use or functional priorities.&#13;
MESRSC staff have also been unable to define and articulate standard operating norms and&#13;
procedures that will allow them to project the implications of investment expenditures for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
recurrent budgets. Finally, once budgets are accorded to the MESRSC, little emphasis is&#13;
placed on monitoring and analyzing actual expenditures in the context of past budgets, or on&#13;
using these figures during the preparation of future budgets (although this is routinely done at&#13;
the MEPUFP). Given the lack of technical justification for budget proposals and spending&#13;
priorities, it is not surprising to find that the MESRSC currently plays an extremely limited role&#13;
in the budget arbitration process.&#13;
(a) Support for Ministry-level financial management (US$0.5 million)&#13;
3.19 Institutional autonomy implies the development of a number of new functions and&#13;
procedures not currently assured within the Ministry. These have to do with the development&#13;
of financial management by the institutions, the development of new procedures for financial&#13;
oversight by the central Ministry, and new methods for the allocation and transfer of funds to&#13;
the institutions. The objective of the project in this area will be to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
the MESRSC to participate constructively in budget arbitration processes, and to strengthen the&#13;
staff of individual institutions in: (a) analyzing current expenditure patterns for operating and&#13;
investment resources with the aim of identifying efficiency gains, (b) preparing and defending&#13;
operating and investment budgets on the basis of standard operating norms and competitive&#13;
criteria, and (c) monitoring and analyzing actual expenditures against budgetary allocations in&#13;
the context of future budget preparation.   Among other activities, this will require&#13;
development of standard accounting codes and budget nomenclature.&#13;
3.20  Since much expenditure authority has long been outside the purview of the Ministry (e.g.&#13;
salaries, fellowships and other transfers that make up in excess of 90% of higher education and&#13;
research costs), procedures will need to be negotiated with the Ministries of Finance and Plan&#13;
regarding these areas by the time of the mid-term review, with legal texts developed and&#13;
information flows spelled out. The circumstances under which institutions can levy fees, receive&#13;
overhead from research contracts, sell services and allocate funds will need to be established. The&#13;
Ministry will become more proactive in its identification of national training needs, and will need to&#13;
develop audit, statistical and planning capacities. It will become involved in the creation of&#13;
institutional incentives and helping define what priorities to give particular research areas.&#13;
3.21 Establishment of a budget unit with internal audit responsibilities, and a computerized&#13;
accounting system acceptable to IDA, will be a condition of effectiveness [para. 7.3 (a)]. The&#13;
project will finance short-term technical assistance focusing on appropriation of skills by&#13;
MESRSC personnel. It will help the DAAF develop new budget nomenclature, implement a&#13;
computer-based budget planning and control system, and work with the institutions to prepare&#13;
and defend budget proposals. The software and hardware for the system will be chosen&#13;
according to criteria defined during project preparation, including general compatibility and&#13;
support within the country, ease of use, scalability, capacity for consolidation, data and&#13;
equipment security, and cost-effectiveness. The budget planning and control system will be&#13;
designed to strengthen the capacity of the DAAF to participate constructively in the budget&#13;
arbitration process. Support will be provided to strengthen the capacity of central staff to&#13;
analyze past spending patterns, monitor current budget commitments and expenditures, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
develop short- and medium-term budget projections. Criteria will be developed for allocating&#13;
budget funds to individual institutions on a competitive basis (efficiency, student enrollments,&#13;
program relevance, teacher qualifications, etc.). These criteria will serve as the basis for&#13;
development of a new budget model and appropriate software. Training will be provided to&#13;
MESRSC staff to improve their capacity to provide timely feedback to institutional financial&#13;
managers regarding budget execution.&#13;
3.22  Project support.  Under the project support will be given for:  (a) training DAAF&#13;
personnel, (b) purchasing computer equipment and software, (c) technical assistance for&#13;
establishing criteria for competitive allocation of budget funds and installing software, and (d)&#13;
incremental operating costs for establishing a budget unit with audit responsibilities.&#13;
(b) Support for institution-level financial management (US$0.6 million)&#13;
3.23 Short-term periodic technical advisors will be provided to the institutions as needed through&#13;
the medium of working groups and training seminars. Consultants will assist institutional personnel&#13;
in drafting work programs. Financial managers and accountants will be trained at each institution in&#13;
the use of budget nomenclature and standard accounting procedures for central block grants and&#13;
locally-generated revenues (student fees, research contracts, etc.). Institutional personmel will&#13;
receive training in the use of budget software developed by the DAAF to enable them to participate&#13;
more meaningfully in the budget preparation process, and to ensure that competitive budget criteria&#13;
are understood and applied within their institution. Several commercial, off-the-shelf accounting&#13;
software packages were considered during project appraisal. Criteria for selection of software and&#13;
hardware have been established (para.3.21). It was agreed that a final decision will be made during&#13;
the first year of the project, following additional training of DAAF personnel to allow them to&#13;
participate meaningfully in the selection process. This component will be considered a success if,&#13;
at the end of implementation, institutional staff were able to use new tools and work methods to&#13;
articulate institutional priorities and to demonstrate the budgetary implications of decision making.&#13;
3.24 Project support. Under the project support will be given for: (a) training seminars for&#13;
institution-level financial managers, (b) purchasing computer equipment and materials, and (c)&#13;
short-term technical assistance.&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.25 The total cost of the project over a four-year period is US$7.4 million, including taxes&#13;
and duties, with a base cost of $US6.5 million equivalent and a foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$3.4 million equivalent. Price contingencies, estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent&#13;
assume an annual domestic inflation rate of 4% and a foreign inflation rate of 2.2%. Physical&#13;
contingencies estimated at US$0.4 million equivalent provide for 10% of base costs for goods.&#13;
IDA's total contribution of US$6.6 million equivalent will finance 100% of foreign costs and&#13;
91 % of local costs, net of taxes and duties. Government will contribute the equivalent of&#13;
US$0.7 million equivalent or 9.7% of total project costs of which US$0.4 million equivalent&#13;
represents taxes and duties. The cost of each project component is as follows: (a) institutional&#13;
reorganization (including project administration), US$3.6 million equivalent; (b) information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
and communication system, US$2.0 million equivalent; and (c) budgetary programming and&#13;
monitoring, US$1.1 million equivalent. Three PPF advances totaling US$640,000 have been&#13;
made available for preliminary studies under components (b) and (c) above. A detailed&#13;
breakdown of costs is presented in Annex 3. The average cost per person-month of expatriate&#13;
consultant services is US$15,000, which is in line with recent experience in Guinea in the&#13;
sector. The project will result in a reduced MESRSC recurrent budget (see economic analysis&#13;
beginning para. 5.1).&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.1   Project preparation benefitted from: (a) up-stream sector work in the form of a green&#13;
cover sector report issued in 1993 outlining issues and priorities for the higher education&#13;
sector; and (b) an intensive, participatory dialogue among key stakeholders within the&#13;
institutions and the central Ministry, leading to development of a policy framework (the&#13;
Government's statement of higher education policy). Additional support was provided by&#13;
three PPF grants totaling US$640,000.&#13;
4.2   A draft implementation manual was submitted to IDA as a condition of negotiations&#13;
[para. 7.1 (c)]. Agreement on the implementation manual was reached during negotiations&#13;
[para. 7.2 (c)]. Its adoption will be a condition of effectiveness [para. 7.3 (b)]. Overall&#13;
project management will be the responsibility of a sectoral steering committee supported by an&#13;
interministerial committee.   The steering committee will be responsible for project&#13;
coordination and development of long-term objectives for higher education and scientific&#13;
research. The interministerial committee will be responsible jointly with the World Bank for&#13;
the conduct of the mid-term review. It will present to Government at that time an overall plan&#13;
for the restructuring of higher education, along with specific recommendations for institutions,&#13;
budget allocations and academic programs.&#13;
B. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.3   Within the framework of the steering committee, individual institutions will bear broad&#13;
responsibility for managing their own project sub-components. Working groups at these&#13;
institutions will be responsible for ultimate project success.  Each institution has already&#13;
organized working groups. All working groups have prepared an agenda of studies and&#13;
activities for the first year of the project. The studies have been through three iterations and&#13;
were the subject of the appraisal mission.  Agreement regarding establishment of a&#13;
management information system to enable the MESRSC to track annual monitoring indicators&#13;
was reached during project negotiations [para. 7.2 (d)]. The establishment of the MIS system&#13;
is a condition of effectiveness [para. 7.3 (c)].&#13;
4.4   A central project coordination unit (PCU) has been established to provide financial and&#13;
logistic support to the steering committee, the interministerial committee, and the individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
working groups. Such assistance includes the drafting of terms of reference, the identification&#13;
of appropriate consultants, the organization of training sessions, etc. The project unit includes&#13;
an accountant, a project assistant and a coordinator.  Responsibility for all IDA-related&#13;
implementation matters (procurement, disbursements, consultant support, reporting, auditing&#13;
etc.) will be handled by the PCU.&#13;
4.5   The steering committee/interministerial committee.  The steering committee was&#13;
created by ministerial decree on February 23, 1994, with modifications through a further&#13;
decree on September 8, 1995. It is composed of representatives from each institution as well&#13;
as from the central ministry (MESRSC) and is chaired by the Secretary-General of MESRSC&#13;
who is delegated by the Minister of Higher Education for this purpose. The interministerial&#13;
committee was created on September 8, 1995, and includes a representative of the Ministry of&#13;
Plan, who serves as its chair, three representatives of the MESRSC, a representative of the&#13;
Ministry of Administrative Reform and Civil Service, a representative of the MEPUFP, and a&#13;
representative of the Ministry of Finance. The two committees receive technical and logistic&#13;
support from the project coordination unit, situated in the MESRSC. The Project Coordinator&#13;
serves as secretary of the steering committee and is responsible with the chair for preparing the&#13;
agenda.&#13;
4.6   The primary mandate of the steering committee is planning, problem solving, and&#13;
evaluation; its role is to act quickly and effectively to facilitate project implementation and to&#13;
ensure that problems are discussed and addressed in a timely manner. It will be responsible&#13;
for monitoring and evaluating the transfer of technical capacity from the advisors provided&#13;
under the project. The interministerial committee holds the responsibility for approving annual&#13;
working plans and budget proposals and ensuring interministerial coordination during project&#13;
implementation.  During project negotiations, agreement was reached with Government&#13;
regarding the interministerial committee's responsibility for ensuring that a mid-term review to&#13;
evaluate the progress made in implementing the project is carried out with IDA by December&#13;
1997, and the steering committee's responsibility for prompt implementation of all measures&#13;
agreed upon with IDA as a result of the mid-term review [para. 7.2 (e)] (see also Annex 4).&#13;
The steering committe will meet as needed, but at least once each two months, with an&#13;
executive committee meeting between regular sessions of the steering committee as needed.&#13;
Its decisions are subject to confirmation by the full steering committee at its subsequent&#13;
session. The interministerial committee will meet a minimum of two times annually. Minutes&#13;
of meetings will be submitted to IDA as part of the progress reports (para. 4.7).&#13;
4.7   The project coordination unit (PCU). The PCU will be responsible for the routine&#13;
functioning of the project. It will organize working group seminars; it will handle IDA-&#13;
specific implementation matters, such as procurement, disbursements and project accounting.&#13;
The PCU will also be responsible for helping to develop the working agendas for meetings of&#13;
the steering committee and the interministerial committee. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached with the Government on submission to IDA of: (i) progress reports on the&#13;
implementation of the project not later than May 31 and November 30 of each year; (ii) annual&#13;
projected work programs and budgets not later than November 30 of each year; and (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
background documents for an annual review of progress to be organized and carried out with&#13;
IDA during the fourth quarter of each calendar year [para. 7.2 (f)]. A primary goal of the&#13;
PCU will be to move towards integration of its functions within the organizational structure of&#13;
the MESRSC over the life of the project. Job descriptions for project coordination unit&#13;
personnel were prepared during project preparation. These job descriptions are subject to&#13;
annual review.&#13;
4.8   Reporting and monitoring. The PCU will be responsible for submitting to IDA: (i)&#13;
semi-annual reports: these will include a summary of progress in procurement and in all key&#13;
project areas of activity, indicating strengths and weaknesses of Project implementation, and&#13;
definition of a work program with monitorable outputs for the following six-month period;&#13;
(ii) periodic evaluation of the training and skills aspects of the technical assistance provided;&#13;
(iii) a report on the mid-term evaluation of project progress; and (iv) an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report no later than six months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.9   The project will be implemented over a four-year period (1995-1999).  This time&#13;
period has been selected to provide ample time for the policy reform initiatives supported&#13;
under the project (front-loaded to the first two years of the project) and the accompanying&#13;
capacity-building activities. Annexes 1 and 5 provide the framework for implementation&#13;
activities and the basis for planning the physical aspects of project implementation. The&#13;
disbursement schedule for the operation is provided in Annex 13.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
4.10 All Bank-financed procurement of goods and services under the Project will be in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines. Table 2 summarizes the project elements as well as their&#13;
estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement.  The Borrower's procurement&#13;
regulations and procedures have been reviewed by IDA, and proposals for improvement are&#13;
currently being discussed. Pending an agreement, IDA standard bidding documents will&#13;
continue to be systematically used for local procurement, as is being done satisfactorily under&#13;
current projects. ICB procurement will use the Bank's relevant standard bidding documents.&#13;
Selection of consulting firms for complex, time-based assignments will be done on the basis of&#13;
the Bank's standard letter of invitation and form of contract. Under the project, procurement&#13;
procedures will be undertaken as described in the following paragraphs.  The aggregate&#13;
amounts provided include taxes and duties. The submission of bidding documents acceptable&#13;
to IDA for all major packages to be procured through ICB during the first year of the project&#13;
is a condition of effectiveness [para. 7.3 (d)].&#13;

Slight differences in amounts may occur due to rounding of figures. Figures in parenthesis are the&#13;
amounts financed by IDA. N.I.F. = Not IDA-financed.&#13;
4.11 Goods. International competitive bidding will be carried out in accordance with IDA&#13;
procurement for contracts with an estimated cost of US$100,000 or more for goods. Locally&#13;
manufactured goods, if any, will receive the margin of preference of 15% or the amount of&#13;
customs and duties, in accordance with Appendix 2, Section 1 to 5 of the Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (January 1995). National Shopping up to an aggregate amount of US$70,000 or&#13;
IAPSO up to an aggregate amount of US$70,000 may be used for purchases of individual&#13;
vehicles or office equipment needed for the project that fall out of schedule with the main ICB&#13;
imports. It is expected that purchases through local shopping and/or IAPSO will not be in&#13;
excess of an aggregate amount of US$140,000 over the life of the project.&#13;
4.12 Consultants and services. Approximately 420 man-months of consultant services for&#13;
management, procurement, auditing and various sectoral and technical services, including&#13;
training totaling the aggregate amount of US$3.2 million equivalent, will be financed by the&#13;
project. This includes 78 man-months of international technical assistance. All technical&#13;
assistance is short-term. These services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines on the "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" (August 1981).&#13;
4.13 Miscellaneous. Other items not subject to competitive bidding include incremental&#13;
staff salaries, supervision and local training allowances, fuel, equipment and vehicle&#13;
maintenance, and other administrative expenses, not to exceed the aggregate amount of&#13;
US$600,000 during the life of the project. These items will be acquired and paid for&#13;
following regular government procedures defined in the implementation manual to be approved&#13;
by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
4.14 Review by IDA. During project execution, bidding packages for IDA-financed&#13;
contracts above the threshold of US$100,000 for goods will be subject to IDA's prior review&#13;
procedures. This review will cover all contracts procured by ICB and about 75% of the total&#13;
value of contracts funded by IDA. The threshold for prior review of consultant services will&#13;
be US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firms, and US$50,000 for contracts with&#13;
individual consultants. Prior review will continue to be required for all terms of reference,&#13;
single source selection of firms, or assignments determined by IDA to be of a critical nature.&#13;
All other contracts will be subject to selective post review.&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
4.15  Disbursement will be in accordance with guidelines set out in the Disbursement&#13;
Handbook. The project is expected to be completed over a four-year period, with the IDA credit&#13;
disbursed over five years. The proposed allocation of the credit is shown in Schedule 3. All&#13;
applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented, except for&#13;
expenditures for training, recurrent costs, and for contracts with a value of US$100,000&#13;
(US$50,000 for individual consultants) or less for goods and services for which reimbursement&#13;
may be made against certified statements of expenditures (SOEs). The PCU will be responsible&#13;
for preparing withdrawal applications and SOEs to be submitted to IDA, and will indicate on the&#13;
SOEs the nature and origin of any goods and the payment date. These will be retained along&#13;
with all other supporting documentation for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
independent auditors.&#13;
4.16 Special accounts. A special account for US$500,000 will be made available to the&#13;
ProjectlMESRSC for payment of eligible expenditures. To facilitate disbursements, the&#13;
Government will open a Special Deposit Account (SDA) in a commercial bank to cover IDA's&#13;
share of eligible expenditures managed by MESRSC. IDA will make an initial deposit of&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent from the proposed Credit upon credit effectiveness and will replenish&#13;
the SDA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditures. Replenishment of&#13;
the SDA will be submitted to IDA every month. Withdrawal applications for direct payment&#13;
from the Credit Account may be submitted for expenditures above US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
(US$100,000 once the entire initial advance has been paid). Supporting documentation will be&#13;
retained by the MESRSC and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision&#13;
missions and project auditors.&#13;

F. Accounting, Auditing, Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
4.17   Auditing. The PCU  will maintain  accounts to record all Project expenditures,&#13;
commitments and reimbursements in accordance with international accepted accounting&#13;
principles. The appointment of an independent auditor under a multi-year contract acceptable to&#13;
IDA is a condition of effectiveness [para. 7.3 (e)]. Advance contracting arrangements for&#13;
auditing services will be made prior to Project effectiveness with independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The auditors' report will also include a separate opinion with respect to&#13;
statements of expenditures, the Special Deposit Account, and a statement on the adequacy or&#13;
otherwise of the accounting system  and internal controls.  Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that annual audit reports, of reasonable scope and detail, will be submitted to IDA&#13;
within six months of the end of the fiscal year [para. 7.2 (g)]. Project financial accounts will be&#13;
audited annually; audit reports will be sent to IDA no later than six months after the close of the&#13;
fiscal year. Overdue audits will be considered grounds for suspension of disbursements under&#13;
the credit.&#13;
4.18 Reports. The PCU will be responsible for submitting to IDA: (i) semi-annual reports;&#13;
these will include a summary of progress in procurement and in all key project areas of&#13;
activity, indicating strengths and weaknesses of Project implementation, and definition of a&#13;
work program with monitorable outputs for the following six-month period; (ii) periodic&#13;
evaluation of the training and skills aspects of the technical assistance provided; (iii) a report&#13;
on the mid-term evaluation of project progress; and (iv) an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
no later than six months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;

5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.1   Background. This project was developed in the context of a clear priority given by&#13;
the Government of Guinea to primary education, a priority which is articulated in its&#13;
statements of sectoral policy both for pre-university and for higher education. Further&#13;
evidence of this priority is reflected in budget trends, where Government has pursued over the&#13;
past five years a deliberate policy to increase primary education's overall share of the Guinean&#13;
education budget while reducing that of higher education. Given the particular weakness of&#13;
the data base in Guinea, the present analysis does not attempt to quantify the external benefits&#13;
of the higher education interventions planned, but looks rather at the internal efficiency savings&#13;
generated by the project (see Annex 1-B for information regarding wage differentials for&#13;
varying levels of education in Guinea). This analysis assumes, in line with the Government's&#13;
stated budget targets, that a portion of the cost savings from higher education will be&#13;
reallocated to finance the expansion of primary and lower secondary education.&#13;
5.2   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 1,1994,&#13;
calls for higher education reform "in light of severe shortcomings in the adequacy of higher&#13;
education training vis-a-vis economic development needs and high unit cost". The unit cost&#13;
per student in a Guinean institution of higher education in 1994, was approximately US$1,420,&#13;
which is close to the average for sub-Saharan Africa, although relatively modest by&#13;
francophone Africa standards. In terms of the quality and relevance of education, however, or&#13;
in terms of the numbers of qualified graduates which the system produces, unit costs can be&#13;
considered extraordinarily high.  Resource allocation is skewed toward scholarships and&#13;
salaries; quality, efficiency and equity are far too low and overhead costs and waste are far too&#13;
high.&#13;
5.3   The analysis presented below estimates internal savings and new revenues generated&#13;
through the project in four key areas, all of which were agreed by Government during&#13;
negotiations: (i) private resource mobilization, (ii) the opening of University social services&#13;
management to competitive bidding, (iii) restriction of scholarships, and (iv) increased&#13;
productivity of teaching and non-teaching personnel. A constant enrollment figure of 8500&#13;
full-time equivalent students is assumed for purposes of this analysis (there are currently 8104&#13;
students; enrollments increased at an average 11 % per year over the past four years but&#13;
Government has agreed to slow the growth of enrollment to 3 % per year over the next four&#13;
years--this would yield an average of approximately 8500 students per year).&#13;
5.4   Private resource mobilization will occur in two ways. Classes will be offered through&#13;
the open University concept on a credit-hour, cost recovery basis to part-time students in the&#13;
evenings. It is conservatively estimated that by the year 2000, these courses will represent 5%&#13;
of all full-time equivalent university students (FTE's), or approximately 400 FTE's. The&#13;
potential on the upside is much higher, with most Western universities reporting that part-time&#13;
adult students represent close to 50% of FTE's. In addition to evening courses, by the end of&#13;
the project an additional 400 regular students will be recruited annually on a paying basis.&#13;
This approach was successfully tested during the 1993-94 school year. These students will pay&#13;
approximately $400 annually (due upon enrollment); evening students will pay approximately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
$800 per FTE equivalent annually). Total income through the program over four years is&#13;
estimated at $1,200,000 (see Table 3).&#13;
5.5    The Government opened the management of cafeteria services to competitive bidding&#13;
for the 1994-95 school year. While this pilot effort suffered a number of start-up difficulties&#13;
(one of the winning firms was ultimately unable to provide an appropriate level of service), the&#13;
Government has confirmed its commitment to private management of cafeteria services and&#13;
will maintain and extend this approach for the upcoming school year. The current annual cost&#13;
of cafeteria and dormitory services is just under $2,000,000, but reliable figures on past costs&#13;
are not available. Recent privatization in CMte d'Ivoire yielded savings of over 50%. A&#13;
similar program in Senegal lowered the unit cost of meals by about 70%. A conservative&#13;
estimate of 25 % additional savings for Guinea would yield annual savings of $500,000.&#13;
5.6    Student scholarships account for 34%  of the annual higher education budget. During&#13;
negotiations, Government agreed to reduce overall scholarship costs by a minimum of 5%&#13;
annually. This yields a total savings of $1.9 million over the course of the project, with&#13;
considerable additional savings expected over time.&#13;

5.7   In addition, the annual cost to the higher education budget for contract teachers and&#13;
overtime fees for professors (US$1.98 million) represents about 42% of the total salary bill.&#13;
The Government's policy statement calls for progressive reduction of overtime payments and&#13;
an increase in teaching hours, with teaching assistants and instructors responsible for 12 hours&#13;
of classroom teaching each week and associate professors and full professors responsible for 10&#13;
hours of classroom teaching each week. By October 31, 1995, Government will issue an&#13;
arrete-ministeriel clarifying the equivalencies for laboratory supervision and small-group&#13;
mentoring (proposed at 2:1 and 1.5: 1, respectively). These measures are expected to result in&#13;
an effective average increase of 20-25 % in hours taught by each teacher. Based on these&#13;
measures, the Government has agreed to reduce overtime payments to teachers by 80% over&#13;
two years, and to reduce expenses for contract teachers by 60% over two years for four-year&#13;
savings of $455,000 and $269,000 respectively (see agreed performance indicators in Annex&#13;
6).   In  addition,  Government pays  approximately  $264,000  annually  to  laborers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
nightwatchmen, etc. It would reduce this amount by 30% over the first two years of the&#13;
project, for a four-year savings of about $269,000.&#13;
5.8   It is expected that other efficiency gains would be identified and implemented through&#13;
the project. These would include savings through the closing or re-orientation of marginal&#13;
programs, increased efficiency in administration of in-country scholarships, increased&#13;
efficiency due to improvements in communication, and lower repetition and dropout rates. On&#13;
the other hand, the project is expected to result in increased annual recurrent expenditures of&#13;
approximately US$100,000 for telephone and communication services, $250,000 for purchase&#13;
of teaching, laboratory, and library materials, and $40,000 for research grants (see Table 4).&#13;
After subtracting these increases in expenditure, the net annual savings from the project would&#13;
be approximately 1.2 million dollars, or just over 4.8 million dollars over the course of the&#13;
project. This represents an annual reduction of about 11 % of the current budget for higher&#13;
education and research. Of this amount, approximately two-thirds would be reinvested in&#13;
higher education and research activities and inputs to be identified. The remaining one-third&#13;
(approximately 1.5 million dollars) would be absorbed into the budget for primary and&#13;
secondary education, continuing a trend begun in 1990, over which period higher education&#13;
has declined from 29% to 18-20% of the education budget. The budget for 1996 is projected&#13;
to decline to 17%, a level at which it would stabilize.&#13;

5.9    Cost comparisons/least cost analysis. It is clear from the above that to maintain the&#13;
status quo with regards to higher education in Guinea would represent a costly option. Three&#13;
alternative financing approaches were considered at the time of project identification: (i) a&#13;
Government proposal for an investment project (cafeteria facilities, library infrastructure and&#13;
holdings, and science laboratories) to cost an estimated US$10.8 million; (ii) a proposal that&#13;
studies be conducted under PPF funding for up to US$1.25 million, leaving open any decision&#13;
about ultimate project costs; and (iii) the current technical assistance project (US$6.6 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
of IDA financing, US$7.4 million overall). The investment project was rejected as premature&#13;
and economically unsound, since at this stage of development in the sector, it would have&#13;
added to recurrent expenditures by upwards of US$400,000 annually, while providing little in&#13;
terms of external efficiency gains.  The sole reliance on PPF funding was considered&#13;
inadequate since it would have left a significant gap between the time that policy reform&#13;
decisions were taken and the time that training was provided for financial management of the&#13;
institutions and overall quality control functions. It was felt that this gap would jeopardize the&#13;
sustainability of reform initiatives. It was also felt that policy reforms could not be adequately&#13;
implemented in the absence of viable communications. The technical assistance approach was&#13;
considered to present lower risk and higher potential payoff, since it would lead to early&#13;
decisions about a new configuration of institutions, and provide for investment in needed&#13;
human resources and management capacity rather than in institutions or programs which might&#13;
ultimately be closed down. It would also lay the groundwork for any future investment and&#13;
provide time and technical guidance for a participatory process of fundamental change. The&#13;
technical assistance approach, with the addition of basic communications infrastructure at the&#13;
University of Conakry, was endorsed at the time of the green cover meeting for the higher&#13;
education sector report and again at the FEPS meeting.&#13;
5.10  Over the course of project preparation, clear signs of reform thinking have emerged&#13;
that would be accelerated through the interventions proposed in the project.  Individual&#13;
faculties have been given the right to limit student enrollments through administration of&#13;
entrance examinations. Guinea is thus one of the few countries in the region able to maintain&#13;
enrollments at manageable levels. Guinea has already moved to encourage private provision of&#13;
tertiary education and is moving to increase cost recovery.  An earlier decision to grant&#13;
institutional autonomy was finally implemented in 1994 through provision of partial block&#13;
grants to all institutions. A sectoral steering committee created by decree in February 1994&#13;
has begun to play an important decision-making role, and provided strong input throughout&#13;
project preparation. The project itself has been structured to ensure that future investments in&#13;
the Guinean higher education system can be planned on a least cost basis. For instance, a&#13;
series of studies will examine user-financed alternative delivery modes through the open&#13;
university concept.  This and other initiatives will provide the Government with clear&#13;
information and relevant experience regarding the feasibility of innovative low-cost approaches&#13;
for future investments. At the same time, options for future investment will be explored to&#13;
ensure that the system is able to meet Guinea's need for highly trained manpower over the&#13;
medium and long terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.1   The economic analysis conducted during project preparation focused on internal&#13;
efficiency savings generated by the project. The external benefits of the interventions planned&#13;
were not quantified because of the weakness of the existing data base, a weakness to be&#13;
addressed under the project. Internal savings and new revenues were estimated in four key&#13;
project areas: (i) private resource mobilization, (ii) the opening of University social services&#13;
management to competitive bidding, (iii) restriction of scholarships, and (iv) increased&#13;
productivity of teaching and non-teaching personnel. It was estimated that cost-savings and&#13;
resource mobilization will amount to US$6.4 million over the life of the project, and that&#13;
additional recurrent costs under the project will amount to US$1.6 million, for net savings&#13;
over four years of approximately US$4.8 million. Key performance indicators have been&#13;
included in Government's Policy Statement for Higher Education and Research (Annex 6).&#13;
6.2   The project will help the Guinean government ensure that future investments in the&#13;
sector are focused on sustainable activities and programs that can be shown to have an impact&#13;
on economic development. By introducing cost recovery measures, it obliges the sector to&#13;
initiate demand-driven programs which provide graduates with marketable skills. Through&#13;
development of criterion-based funding, along with accreditation mechanisms, the project&#13;
provides incentives to individual institutions to achieve long overdue cost efficiencies. Along&#13;
with the budgetary targets included in the Government's policy statement for higher education,&#13;
to be monitored throughout the project, this will further ensure that the absolute priority given&#13;
to primary education is maintained, and that funds are freed for the continued expansion of&#13;
primary and secondary education and for improvements in the quality of higher education.&#13;
Recasting the role of the MESRSC as one of support and quality control, rather than direct&#13;
management will reduce political tensions throughout the entire sector and provide a more&#13;
stable environment, conducive to the long-term sustainability of reform efforts.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.3   The project is low risk. Policy reform measures have been front-loaded early in the&#13;
project cycle to ensure that they remain the focus of activities and the subject of the annual and&#13;
mid-term reviews. The main short-term risks include the availability of capable leadership to&#13;
guide the reform process and potential opposition from interest groups (students, faculty) that&#13;
may see themselves as losers in the process; long-term risks include the potential failure of&#13;
Government to provide adequate ongoing budgetary support and the converse possibility that&#13;
increased investments in higher education will draw resources away from primary education.&#13;
These risks cannot be entirely eliminated, but they have been addressed through the&#13;
participatory, consensual approach taken to project development.  Intensive budgetary&#13;
discussions were held with representatives from the MEPUFP and the MESRSC, as well as the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, to ensure agreement on budgetary funding that gives a continuing priority&#13;
to primary education. These agreements are included in the policy letters for both ministries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
and will be a focus of annual and mid-term reviews for this project and for the Equity and&#13;
School Improvement Project approved by the Board in May 1995.&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING AND SKILLS TRANSFER&#13;
1.    The Higher Education Management Support Project aims to help decision makers at all&#13;
levels to improve their capacity to reform Guinea's education system. With regards to technical&#13;
assistance, the strategy adopted is to recruit high caliber expertise with a comnrnitment to on-the-&#13;
job training and the ability to transfer skills and knowledge. This orientation is a major focus of&#13;
the consultant terms of reference already drafted for technical advisors to be recruited under the&#13;
Project. To ensure that training and skills transfer receive priority during implementation, several&#13;
actions have been taken:&#13;
(a)   The consultant profiles developed for all technical advisor posts emphasize the&#13;
importance of training, team building and communication skills. These criteria will&#13;
be weighted heavily during the consultant selection process.&#13;
(b)   All terms of reference for consultant support outline a proposed process of&#13;
interaction between technical expert and ministerial or institutional staff, as well as&#13;
with other stakeholders as appropriate. The technical advisors will be required to&#13;
interact with Ministry and institutional personnel in a "working group" format, in&#13;
order to encourage participation and dissemination of information. The technical&#13;
advisors will be responsible for organizing workshops in stakeholders discuss their&#13;
objectives and strategies. They will also organize training seminars and fora in&#13;
which Ministry and institutional staff will present the results of their work to their&#13;
colleagues. The emphasis will be on appropriation of skills by Ministry and&#13;
institutional counterparts.&#13;
(c)   All terms of reference include criteria for evaluating the work of technical advisors&#13;
with heavy emphasis on achieving training and skills appropriation objectives.&#13;
2.    Because of the emphasis placed on developing and implementing management tools and&#13;
information flow procedures and on improving work methods and practices, on-the-job training is&#13;
most suited to achieving the Project's capacity-building objectives. The bulk of training under the&#13;
Higher Education Management Support Project will be provided on the job. Workshops and&#13;
seminars will also be organized to facilitate inter-office communication and the dissemination of&#13;
information. Arrangements will be made under the information systems component to train key&#13;
personnel in the use of relevant software, and to provide trouble-shooting support throughout the&#13;
project period. This training will be conducted in the context of group sessions. The training&#13;
aspects of this Project will be considered a success if, at the end of Project implementation,&#13;
Ministry staff were able to use new tools, information and work methods to articulate needs and&#13;
justify decision-making processes, particularly in the context of requests for operating and&#13;
investment resources.               &#13;

HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SlUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
MiD-TERM REViEw&#13;
1.    The mid-term review is an important part of the supervision plan for this project. Its goal&#13;
is to determine the progress achieved for each project component as a function of the initial&#13;
objectives. It will take place approximately two years after project effectiveness and will provide&#13;
the key opportunity to ensure that needed policy reforms are in place.  Agreement on&#13;
implementation of a matrix of policy reforms is included in the Development Credit Agreement as&#13;
a dated covenant. The mid-term review will examine project-specific implementation as well as&#13;
broader project impact on Ministry and institutional operations and will be the joint responsibility&#13;
of the World Bank and the Government of Guinea. The following evaluation criteria, broken&#13;
down by project component, will be used:&#13;
(a)   Institutional reorganization&#13;
(i)   agreement on implementation of a policy reform matrix, including:&#13;
a.    competitive criteria for block grants to institutions;&#13;
b.    teaching hours and conditions for contract and tenured professors;&#13;
c.    curtailing and prioritizing of student scholarships, with a significant&#13;
increase in the proportion of female students;&#13;
d.    application of user fees and cost recovery;&#13;
e.    privatization of cafeteria and other services;&#13;
f     closing of marginal programs and institutions; and&#13;
g.    increased financing for non-salary expenditures.&#13;
(ii)   successful execution of study agendas for the first two years;&#13;
(iii)  development and application of accreditation processes by the Ministry of&#13;
Higher Education;&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
POLICY STATEMENT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In 1984, there were 10,994 students in 39 institutions of higher education in Guinea, with&#13;
1,981 teachers. Recognizing the serious distortions of the sector, as well as the complete lack of&#13;
financial viability and quality, the national conference on education held in May/June 1984&#13;
established a far-reaching program to improve quality and efficiency. Today, as a result of that&#13;
effort, the sector manages two universities and three specialized institutions of higher learning,&#13;
with 8,104 students and 786 full-time professors.&#13;
2.    The research sector has also undergone profound changes. Many research institutions&#13;
operate under the aegis of other ministries, leaving the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific&#13;
Research and Culture (MESRC) to manage nine research centers and three documentation&#13;
centers.&#13;
3.    The dramatic reduction in numbers and the recent decision to grant the institutions of&#13;
higher education greater administrative and financial autonomy bear witness to the determination&#13;
of the government to create high-quality institutions. However, the level of material and financial&#13;
resources available, the relevance of the teaching and research programs, the efficiency with&#13;
which they are managed, and the quality of graduates and research products all are far below what&#13;
has been intended. For this reason, the government has decided to redefine its development&#13;
strategy for this sector.&#13;
Sectoral issues&#13;
4.    Relevance of training and research. It is now widely recognized that the capacities&#13;
which University students bring to bear on problems in the marketplace are unsatisfactory to the&#13;
few potential employers and to the teachers themselves. More broadly, the major challenges&#13;
ahead with regards to the development of the sector are as follows: (i) to redefine programs and&#13;
courses as a function of marketplace and manpower needs, in line with the country's policies for&#13;
job creation; (ii) to reallocate sectoral resources as a function of established priorities; (iii) to limit&#13;
the number of students entering higher education according to established need; and (iv) to&#13;
establish links among the teaching institutions, among the research institutions, and between the&#13;
teaching and research institutions. These concerns taken as a whole require new paradigms for&#13;
the strategic goals of higher education and research over the short, medium and long terms. The&#13;
development of these paradigms must be a participative process, including all of the principal&#13;
stakeholders, including the students themselves as well as potential employers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
5.    Inputs and system efficiency. A significant change in the respective roles of the central&#13;
ministry and the institutions constitutes a necessary prerequisite for responding to the concerns&#13;
mentioned above. At the central level, there must be a capacity to: (i) define and communicate to&#13;
the institutions the national priorities for the sector; and (ii) monitor the extent to which these&#13;
priorities are being carried out.&#13;
6.    At the institutional level, it is imperative that information concerning: (i) market conditions&#13;
and dynamics; (ii) the number and type of qualifications required by the economy as a function of&#13;
currently utilized production technologies and techniques; (iii) optimal approaches for the&#13;
acquisition of these competencies; and (iv) the best means to ensure that competencies acquired&#13;
are correctly utilized. An appraisal of our system on this basis reveals serious deficiencies.&#13;
7.    Shortcomings can also be found with regards to: (i) teaching and research personnel; (ii)&#13;
teaching and research materials (books, laboratory equipment, scientific journals, etc.); (iii)&#13;
communications; and (iv) an evaluation system providing teachers and administrators with&#13;
information regarding student learning achievement.&#13;
8.    In terms of inputs, for example, 31 years after the creation of the higher education and&#13;
research system, the country has an almost completely Guinean cadre of teaching personnel, and&#13;
has succeeded in raising the average student-teacher ratio to a satisfactory level. However, from&#13;
the perspective of working conditions, or contributions to the local and international development&#13;
of science, much remains to be done. Highly qualified professors are few in number, and there are&#13;
very few productive researchers. Those who do exist, are not well distributed across the various&#13;
institutions and programs. Similarly, the ongoing deterioration of the physical infrastructure has&#13;
reached an advanced stage in all institutions, and the lack of pedagogical materials is pervasive.&#13;
9.    In order to better manage the system, a process to evaluate its internal and external&#13;
infrastructure is indispensable. To this end, viable information regarding the activities of the&#13;
institutions is needed so that the authorities have the ability, for example, of monitoring the&#13;
evolution of achievement of priorities, evaluating existing programs, improving management, and&#13;
determining future resource needs. Some of this information is currently unavailable or, at least,&#13;
hard to access.&#13;
10.   Financial constraints and unit costs. The financial constraints to improved efficiency&#13;
can be found at four main levels: (i) the reliance on a sole source of financing (the state and its&#13;
external partners); (ii) general underfunding; (iii) the skewed allocation of funds in the training and&#13;
research budgets; and (iv) inefficient management (the lethargic process of disbursement, for&#13;
example) of the minimal resources available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
11.   As a corollary of budget allocations, the high unit costs of higher education and research&#13;
should not be seen solely in terms of their absolute value. Their breakdown on the basis of&#13;
salaries, infrastructure, equipment, social transfers, and other teaching and research inputs, reveals&#13;
additional problems to be addressed.&#13;
12.   Social demand for higher education. In spite of the problems indicated above, the&#13;
demographic pressure from primary and secondary schooling, and the personal advantages&#13;
inherent in the possession of a university diploma, mean that the demand for university training&#13;
will continue to grow. If the current tendency is maintained, enrollments in higher education will&#13;
easily surpass the threshold of 10,000 students by the year 2000.  This will have harmful&#13;
consequences for the sector since projected economic growth will not be sufficient to finance the&#13;
additional needs and maintain the system even at its current low level. Consequently, the&#13;
government has decided to implement an ambitious new strategy seen as absolutely essential for&#13;
the sector's future development.&#13;
13.   Development strategy. All investments in research and higher education in Guinea must&#13;
be for the purpose of contributing to the economic and social development of the country. This&#13;
implies the need to prepare a range of strategic objectives that can provide a basis for fundamental&#13;
changes in policy and in organizational structure. Such a vision will encompass short-, medium-,&#13;
and long-term needs.&#13;
14.   Short-term objectives will be premised on creation of a consensus in order to achieve&#13;
acceptance of the profound changes needed in structure, in management, and in the relevance of&#13;
training and research programs. In particular, teachers and students will be invited to participate&#13;
in serious debate over the future of the sector, with a transparent examination of programs,&#13;
structures, and budgets.&#13;
15.   Medium- and long-term objectives will be oriented toward the strengthening of the&#13;
operational autonomy of the institutions. In pursuing these objectives, the future system of higher&#13;
education and research will need to differ significantly from the present system in several basic&#13;
aspects. First, it will need to be flexible enough to respond to changing demand. In the short&#13;
term, for training purposes, this implies controlling student flows and strengthening the idea of&#13;
cost sharing. Second, the system will need to ensure that available financing is well used,&#13;
including a rationalization of use of teaching and research personnel.&#13;
16.   These efforts will need to be pursued with the goal of maintaining a consensus among all&#13;
interested parties:  students, parents, teaching staff, researchers, potential employers, and&#13;
government.  The approach will need to be essentially participative, including a better&#13;
understanding on all sides of the concept of institutional autonomy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
17.   Institutional autonomy. The best way to rebuild higher education and research is to do&#13;
it from within the institutions themselves, through a gradual process. In the short term, greater&#13;
institutional autonomy will require that the state rethink its role. The state will ensure that the&#13;
following objectives are attained: (i) transparency in managing change policies; (ii) a search for&#13;
additional sources of financing; (iii) contribution to the preparation, implementation and&#13;
monitoring of institutional budget processes; (iv) allocation of resources granting priority to&#13;
inputs linked to improvements in quality; (v) social equity within the institutions; (vi) donor&#13;
coordination; and (vii) coordination between higher education and the Ministries of Finance, Plan,&#13;
and Administrative Reform.&#13;
18.   The government has already implemented this year a system of competitive entrance&#13;
examinations in order to limit the inflow of students. This means that the end of secondary&#13;
schooling does not necessarily lead to access to higher education. In addition, the government&#13;
will progressively put into place over the next three years a system of autonomous financial&#13;
management, by which the institutions will assume the responsibility for developing and justifying&#13;
their own budgets and the use of scholarship funds. The role of the government will be limited to&#13;
defining the criteria for allocation of funds and evaluating the results. It is expected that this&#13;
measure will encourage the institutions to maintain enrollments at more manageable levels, and&#13;
that the proportion of budgets allocated to improvements in quality will be considerably increased.&#13;
19.   Open university.  Several approaches are under consideration for reducing the cost&#13;
burden of the state by increasing the efficiency with which teachers are used. Almost all of these&#13;
approaches presume a much more open and flexible relationship between higher education and its&#13;
potential clientele: (i) the development of private higher education will be encouraged; (ii) the new&#13;
institutions of higher education will maintain open doors, from the perspective of the programs&#13;
offered, the type of student enrolled (full time or part time), and the period during which&#13;
individuals wishing to study are allowed to do so. This new approach will help reduce the&#13;
bottleneck created by entrance into university immediately following secondary schooling and will&#13;
lead to financial contributions by individuals and businesses; (iii) the teaching loads of professors&#13;
will be revised as a function (among others) of their administrative responsibilities and their real&#13;
research programs; payment for overtime will be strictly limited to professors participating in&#13;
activities generating additional resources for the university; and (iv) restaurant services, already&#13;
privatized, will be more open to competition in order to save funds which will be reinvested in&#13;
qualitative improvements. It goes without saying that an immediate and radical improvement in&#13;
communication within the sector is the sine qua non of all of these approaches and indeed, of any&#13;
approach aiming to improve the quality and relevance of the sector.&#13;
20.   Political and social marketing of the reform. Higher education is a very politically&#13;
sensitive arena. It offers a number of concrete advantages to a wide variety of groups and&#13;
individuals. Any change in the distribution of these advantages will be poorly received by those&#13;
who consider themselves to be losers, and naturally, well received by those who benefit. It is&#13;
important, well before any changes are made, to identify the probable reactions of these groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(students, parents, teachers, government officials) and to address their concerns. This will require&#13;
a plan for social and political marketing to explain the advantages of the changes and to create a&#13;
constituency which is supportive of them. This plan is a part of the participative approach&#13;
planned in the context of reforms to be put in place. In this context, it is also important to be able&#13;
to show students and professors concrete actions to improve their working conditions (at the&#13;
level, for instance, of the library, of science laboratories, of textbook availability, of means of&#13;
communication, of computers, etc.)&#13;
21.   Summary and conclusions.  In summary, then, the government's strategy for higher&#13;
education and research consists of immediately putting in place a process of change involving all&#13;
of the stakeholders in the system. This process will aim not only to achieve a change in role for&#13;
the institutions (management autonomy, reorientation of programs as a function of market needs)&#13;
and of the ministry (establishment of norms, evaluation and control of quality), but also a change&#13;
in behavior at all levels in order to ensure quality, transparency, and efficiency. The process will&#13;
be accompanied by a strong accent on the practical training of personnel in new approaches to&#13;
management, administration, collection and use of data, organization, etc.&#13;
22.   Improvements in efficiency. Improvements in efficiency over the short and medium&#13;
terms will include the following: (i) cost recovery, (ii) more efficient use of teaching staff, (iii) a&#13;
transparent system of financial management, (iv) progressive implementation of block grants to&#13;
institutions, (v) privatization of cafeteria services, (vi) more flexible working hours and conditions&#13;
(open university concept), (vii) encouragement of private higher education, and (viii)&#13;
collaboration with other institutions of higher education in the region.&#13;
23.   Improvements in quality. Improvements in quality over the short and medium terms will&#13;
include the following activities: (i) implementation of a better system of communication, (ii)&#13;
redistribution of budget resources in favor of pedagogic inputs, (iii) competitive entrance&#13;
examination to limit student enrollments, and (iv) new role of quality control for the ministry.&#13;
24.   Improvements in relevance.  Improvements in the relevance of higher education&#13;
presuppose the implementation of new programs and courses, and the cancellation of programs&#13;
and courses not linked to market needs. This aspect will take into consideration the country's&#13;
global development strategy. Among others, for example, new courses or programs could be&#13;
developed to train personnel for decentralized administration, to strengthen the country's&#13;
communications capacity, to reinforce computerization and transparent management of services&#13;
(public and private), and to create new competencies within the pre-university education system&#13;
(training of school directors, support for training handicapped or gifted students, etc.).&#13;
25.   In the long term, following a process of upgrading capacity and developing consensus, the&#13;
government will look for external support to complement internal resources in order to&#13;
rehabilitate existing infrastructure, acquire equipment, and develop a true university library. It is&#13;
understood in this process that the priority of the government in favor of basic education will be&#13;
maintained, indeed, reinforced, by the approach planned for improving the functioning of higher&#13;
education. The improvement of higher education should at the same time have a positive impact&#13;
on quality at all levels of education as well as on the economic development of the country.&#13;

26.   The following performance indicators translate the Government's policy into operational&#13;
terms for the four year span of the PADES:&#13;
(a)   higher education's percentage of the education budget, which was between 25%&#13;
and 30% prior to the PASE, will be kept in the range of 17% to 20% over the next four years;&#13;
(b)   non-salary operating expenditures will be increased to 25% of the operating&#13;
budget for higher education and research by 1999;&#13;
(c)   cost recovery and user fees will constitute between 5% and 10% of budget&#13;
revenues by 1999;&#13;
(d)   Required teachers hours will be as follows: 12 hours for assistant professors and&#13;
instructors and 10 hours for associate professors and professors, with one hour of classroom&#13;
teaching considered equivalent to two hours of laboratory supervision and one-and-a-half hours of&#13;
small group mentoring;&#13;
(e)   student enrollment will be maintained between 8500 and 9000 over the next four&#13;
years;&#13;
(f)   an annual budget of US$100,000 will be devoted to developing a competitive&#13;
research grant program based on development needs;&#13;
(g)   the cost of social transfers in the overall budget will be reduced by 5% annually.&#13;

HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
SELECTED ACTIVITIES INSTITUTIoNAL REORGANIZATION COMPONENT&#13;
(listed by working group) I&#13;
1.     The following summary descriptions are based on detailed proposals and terms of&#13;
reference reviewed during the appraisal mission. The full documentation for these studies is&#13;
maintained in project files and is available upon request. For proposals covering more than one&#13;
year, only the first year's activities have been appraised. A complete list of project activities is&#13;
provided in Annex 1. These are subject to annual approval by the Steering Committee, the&#13;
Interministerial Committee and IDA on the basis of terms of reference, budgets, and an&#13;
implementation calendar.&#13;
University of Conakry&#13;
2.     Competitive research grants.  This initiative will be carried out jointly with the&#13;
University of Kankan. The intent is to re-establish the management of research activities as a&#13;
legitimate function within the university context. Grants averaging $1000 to $2000 will be&#13;
awarded to University-based researchers on a competitive basis, using criteria developed for this&#13;
purpose. Additional sources of funding, including fee-generating activities within the Universities,&#13;
will be sought at the time of the mid-term project review.&#13;
3.     Measurement of student achievement. The goal of this initiative is to develop a method&#13;
for evaluating student learning in a way that provides a reliable basis for comparison on an annual&#13;
basis. It is anticipated that feedback received will be used to alter individual course content,&#13;
teaching methodology or the broad program of studies. This will be a pilot study of student&#13;
learning outcomes conducted by the Faculty of Sciences. Technical assistance will be sought&#13;
from two sources: (i) a dean or a qualified professor from a College or Faculty of Sciences in a&#13;
developed country will conduct an external evaluation of the curriculum as taught at the&#13;
University of Conakry and together with an evaluation expert will help develop an evaluation&#13;
process for monitoring student learning outcomes, and (ii) a series of visits will be undertaken to&#13;
Faculties of Science in other African universities (English-speaking and French-speaking). A&#13;
visiting scholar will be invited from one of these institutions for a two-month period in each of the&#13;
last two years of the project to provide input into the evaluation process.&#13;
This list of studies deals only with activities planned under the Institutional Reorganization component. As such, it&#13;
does not include the training of institutional personnel in financial management and budgetary planning, the&#13;
development of viable communication systems, or the establishment of statistical data-gathering capacity at the&#13;
institutional level, all of which is being done through other project components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.    Fit between employment/training. Four internal task forces have been designated at the&#13;
Polytechnic Institute to develop needs assessments in the following areas: (i) engineering training,&#13;
(ii) technicians' training, (iii) support of income-generating activities, and (iv) administrative&#13;
streamlining. Each unit will start its activities with an evaluation of the current situation, for&#13;
example, with a study which will assess the quantitative and qualitative needs for engineers. The&#13;
Terms of Reference already developed by the first two task forces include a tracer study of former&#13;
graduates to determine whether the training received has proven relevant to their current&#13;
employment. Based on the ongoing recommendations of these task forces, the Polytechnic&#13;
Institute of Conakry will propose in-depth studies for the second and third years of the project.&#13;
5.    Open University-fee-generating activities. The Faculty of Business and Management&#13;
will take the lead in establishing pilot programs to develop greater financial self-sufficiency. It&#13;
will, among other activities, develop night school and alternative education programs. During&#13;
project preparation, it has already moved to establish a consultancy unit with a fee scale derived&#13;
from the Guinean salary environment that will permit Government agencies to compete with&#13;
international agencies for competent research personnel, while providing a source of income for&#13;
the faculty and a source of professional development for individual faculty members. The&#13;
proposed consultancy group will negotiate standard fee-sharing arrangements with the University,&#13;
as well as a professional code of ethics for University professor/consultants, with clear description&#13;
of the rights and responsibilities of both the professor/consultant, the University, and students.&#13;
6.    Reorganization of student services management.  The first year's activities will be&#13;
organized around a comparative study carried out by a national team. It will deal with a wide&#13;
range of issues relating to student services, including boarding facilities, transportation, and local&#13;
scholarships. The team will include student representation. The team will survey student services&#13;
at the two major universities in Guinea. It will travel to a range of institutions in different&#13;
countries within and outside of the region. It will prepare a comparative report of student&#13;
services offered in the countries surveyed, demonstrating similarities or differences with the&#13;
Guinean experience and analyzing these differences. Recommendations from this study will be&#13;
geared to identifying for more focused follow-up work in the last two years of the project.&#13;
University of Kankan&#13;
7.    Tracer study fit between training and employment.  A tracer study of recent&#13;
University graduates will be conducted to determine the relevance of training received at the&#13;
University. This study will seek to determine the impact of the schooling received in particular on&#13;
employment opportunities in the rural areas as opposed to Conakry.&#13;

8.    Competitive research grants.  This initiative will be carried out jointly with the&#13;
University of Conakry. The intent is to re-establish the management of research activities as a&#13;
legitimate function within the university context. Grants averaging $1000 to $2000 will be&#13;
awarded to University-based researchers on a competitive basis, using criteria developed for this&#13;
purpose. Additional sources of funding, including fee-generating activities within the Universities,&#13;
will be sought at the time of the mid-term project review.&#13;
9.    Reorganization of student services. This study will be carried out jointly with the&#13;
University of Conakry (see above). Carried out by a national team, it will deal with the full range&#13;
of issues relating to student services, including boarding facilities, transportation, and local&#13;
scholarships. It will look at particular problems related to the isolation and relatively poor state of&#13;
facilities at the University of Kankan.&#13;
Mining and Geology Institute of Boke&#13;
10.   Tracer study of graduates.  In order to determine the external efficiency of the&#13;
specialized programs offered at Boke, a tracer study of recent graduates will be conducted. This&#13;
study will analyze the type of employment obtained, employer evaluations as to the&#13;
appropriateness of training received, and the average length of time spent seeking employment.&#13;
This study will be paired with a program evaluation (see [b]) and a study of linkages with the&#13;
Institut Polytechnique (see [c]) to help determine the most appropriate approach for future&#13;
training in the mining sector.&#13;
11.   Restructuring/privatization/program  evaluation.  The potential for greater private&#13;
sector involvement in the training activities currently organized by the Institute of Boke will be&#13;
explored through external evaluation.&#13;
12.   Linkages with the Polytechnical Institute. This study will look at the potential for&#13;
greater institutional collaboration for the engineering programs at the two institutions.&#13;
Teacher Training Institute of Guinea&#13;
13.   Decentralized management-modules, contract teachers. The Teacher Training Institute&#13;
has in recent years become a de facto provider of short-term tailor-made training programs, often&#13;
in support of the ongoing need for retraining personnel within the civil service. However, the&#13;
Institution's management structure has not kept pace with these new needs. This activity will&#13;
help create the management capacity for developing short-term modules and training packages on&#13;
a low-cost contract basis. It will be complemented by pedagogic support for the creation of&#13;
special needs courses (see [b]).&#13;
14.   Creation of special needs courses (principals, GT, LD, ag.). The Ministry for Pre-&#13;
University Education and Vocational Training (MEPUFP) has increasingly expressed a need for&#13;
courses in a range of areas: elementary school instructional leadership, gifted and talented pupils,&#13;
learning disabled students or students with other disabilities, as well as such one-time needs as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

retraining for former agriculture extension agents, etc. This activity will provide the technical&#13;
assistance and other support necessary for development of these courses.&#13;
Agriculture and Veterinary Institute of Faranah (ISAV)&#13;
15.   Program evaluation. The purpose of the study is to develop and apply test instruments for&#13;
the four departments or faculties within the institution: agriculture, water and forestry, livestock&#13;
raising, and rural engineering. Results will be used to analyze the appropriateness of course&#13;
offerings for current needs within the country. This activity will be carried out in collaboration&#13;
with the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
16.   Development of fee-generating activities. An agricultural marketing consultant will be&#13;
asked to evaluate the potential transformation of two existing programs into fee-generating&#13;
activities for the Institute:  a seed dissemination initiative and a program  of agricultural&#13;
innovations.&#13;
CERESCOR (Conakry-Rogbane Oceanographic Research Center)&#13;
17.   Evaluation of scientific and administrative management. From the time of its creation,&#13;
activities at CERESCOR were carried out in the framework of collaboration between Guinea and&#13;
the former Soviet Union. Since the end of Soviet support, the institution has declared its desire to&#13;
become autonomous, i.e. responsible for its own management and financing. The unit from the&#13;
marine biology research center has conducted considerable research on issues such as coastal&#13;
pollution, etc. However, its publication record to date is dismal, considerable hampering its&#13;
capacity to develop its reputation and develop outside sources of income. It has no rigorous&#13;
procedures for internal evaluation of its scientific management or for peer review. Similarly, its&#13;
internal publications are not subject to refereeing. This activity will link an external evaluation of&#13;
scientific and administrative management to the provision of in-service training of personnel. This&#13;
process will culminate in a two-week seminar for all research staff.&#13;
IRBAG&#13;
18.   Evaluation of cost generation potential. The administrative and financial autonomy of&#13;
IRBAG requires that the institution develop the capacity to offer its services and products in a&#13;
competitive market. External consult support will be sought to determine the potential for&#13;
generating resources through such existing programs as production of snake venom, production&#13;
of plant-based drugs, vaccinations, laboratory animals, ecotourism, etc.&#13;
Directorate for Higher Education&#13;
19.   Establishment of accreditation procedures. The directorate of higher education will&#13;
develop guidelines for assuming a new role of quality control. This activity will take place over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the four-year project lifespan. During the first year, two forms of technical assistance are&#13;
envisaged: (i) the services of a regional accreditation agency or its equivalent (from the United&#13;
States or Europe) will be secured in order to develop initial accreditation protocols. These&#13;
protocols will include provisions for institutional self-evaluation and external inspection according&#13;
to criteria to be established; (ii) a national team will be trained to test draft protocols with selected&#13;
faculties. While this team may ultimately evolve into the role of an independent accrediting&#13;
agency, it will work initially under the aegis of the Directorate for Higher Education. Over the&#13;
next two years of the project, all existing institutions will be evaluated (including a self-&#13;
evaluation). By the fourth year, it is expected that the quality control function will be a routine&#13;
feature of MESRSC activity and responsibilities.&#13;
20.   Development of competitive funding criteria. The recent experience of the polytechnic&#13;
institutions in Britain will be used as a model for developing competitive funding criteria.&#13;
Guidelines to be established will include teacher quality, program cost, program relevance,&#13;
student outcomes and overall efficiency. A national team will meet with representatives of the&#13;
various institutions to determine what needs ought to be served and which should receive a lower&#13;
priority in the allocation of resources. These studies will inform the steering committee which will&#13;
eventually decide on the recommendations.&#13;
Directorate for Scientific Research&#13;
21.   Establishment of a national research council.  (i) the  Directorate for Scientific&#13;
Research proposes to establish in fact what currently exists on paper only-a national research&#13;
council. This group will visit research councils and foundations in other countries and become&#13;
acquainted with approaches to R&amp;D policy-making. It will also receive training to help it acquire&#13;
the managerial capacity necessary for coordination and evaluation. It will be funded by but&#13;
operate independently of the directorate of national research; (ii) the directorate of national&#13;
research proposes to develop a computerized data base that will inventory research activities in&#13;
Guinea. The inventory of research projects will make it possible to bring far more coherence in&#13;
the organization of various laboratories and activities than is presently the case, allowing scarce&#13;
resources to be used more efficiently. Personnel will become acquainted with international&#13;
resources potentially available to Guinean researchers. The directorate will become a resource for&#13;
researchers and a clearinghouse for information.&#13;

            Guinea - Higher Education Management
            Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of Higher Education
            Technical Assistance Project is to provide a framework for
            the rationalization of higher education in Guinea. Its
            long-term objective will be to establish a reconfigured,
            streamlined system with greater institutional autonomy,
            improved cost-effectiveness, and increased relevance for
            economic development. The project will provide support for
            policy reform and for capacity-building. It consists of
            three major components: 1) institutional reorganization; 2)
            development of an information and communication system; and
            3) establishment of budgetary programming and monitoring capacities.
