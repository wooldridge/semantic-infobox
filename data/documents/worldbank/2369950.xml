                              A. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The Conflict,The Transition, And TheEmergency&#13;
&#13;
 1.    Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest suffering countries among members o f the&#13;
 World Bank-ravaged         by chronic conflict and political instability. An estimated 4 to 7 million&#13;
people remain vulnerable to hunger with a large number dependent on a massive inflow of food&#13;
 and humanitarian aid. Afghanistan's infrastructure has been destroyed or degraded; its human&#13;
resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded. Despite resilient public&#13;
 administrationstructures, majority o f the state institutions are not able to function effectively, and&#13;
the economy and society have become fragmented.&#13;
&#13;
2.     The aftermath o f September 11, 2001, precipitated change in the political and military&#13;
situation in Afghanistan. The collapse o f the Taliban regime was followed by the conclusion on&#13;
December 5, 2001, in Bonn, Germany, o f the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in&#13;
Afghanistan Pending the Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions (the Bonn&#13;
Agreement)-an        agreement, among the different groups in opposition to the Taliban regime on a&#13;
new structure o f government and a process that would lead to the election o f a fully representative&#13;
government within a period o f about 30 months.&#13;
&#13;
3.     The Interim Administration peacefully took over central administration on December 22,&#13;
2001. After six months an Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) took place in June 2002.&#13;
This Loya Jirga elected a Transitional Administration' that is expectedto pave the way for a new&#13;
constitution and an elected, fully representative government within 2 years. This Transitional&#13;
Administration has the power to promulgate, repeal, and amend laws and regulations through a&#13;
decree.&#13;
&#13;
4.     Despite being hampered by limited capacity and a difficult security situation in many parts&#13;
o f the country, the TISA has improved the quality o f governance and decision-making both at the&#13;
center and in the provinces. It has gained widespread international recognition and moral&#13;
authority. Basic government functions have been restored and international relations re-&#13;
established. The TISA has put forward a compelling vision and strategy for national&#13;
reconstruction embodied inits National Development Framework (NDF, April 2002).&#13;
&#13;
5.     For about 80 percent o f Afghanistan's population that lives in rural areas, incomes are at&#13;
subsistence level due to high pressure2 on cultivable land, cyclical droughts (the last between&#13;
1999 and 2002) and destruction o f livelihoods as a result o f prolonged conflict and instability-&#13;
many families are effectively below subsistence level. A large number o f families have been&#13;
displaced internally or to neighboring countries. As part of the post conflict transition to peace,&#13;
large numbers o f people are returning to Afghanistan, putting additional pressure on resources.&#13;
&#13;
' TheTransitional   Islamic State o fAfghanistan (TISA).&#13;
 About 75 percent o f Afghanistan's area is uninhabitable, (highly mountainous or desert); 14percent is&#13;
suitable for agriculture, and only 4 percent is cultivated inany givenyear (some areas remain fallow while&#13;
others are usedfor pasture). Part o f this arable land is innarrow mountain valleys and the rest is inflat&#13;
lowlands, mostly inthe country's northand west regions. Water is a limiting factor, so much so that&#13;
villages are sometimes defined as those households sharing a water source. A rural population estimated at&#13;
about 20 millionpersons (no census has beenundertaken for more than a decade) and a total land area o f&#13;
about 650,000 square km, results ina density o f about two persons per hectare o f arable agricultural land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Trading, a traditional activity, has been constrained but seems to be reviving. Still, some borders&#13;
 may not be crossed easily or at all, and insome places "tolls" are also being exacted. Outside o f a&#13;
 few cities, telecommunications and other utility services, taken for granted elsewhere, are almost&#13;
nonexistent in Afghanistan. Credit i s rarely available, via mortgages or suppliers' credits,&#13;
 implying high interest rates and hardly worth the risk. Inthe absence o f commercial banlung,&#13;
 transactions need to be in cash or barter, or through informal money transfer agents (the hawala&#13;
 system). Unemployment and underemployment are widespread. While imported grains are&#13;
needed, food aid i s reported to be depressing farm prices, and increasing the relative cost o f&#13;
 acquiringnonfarm goods by way o f selling crops.&#13;
&#13;
 6.    Poor and deteriorated infrastructure further increases costs to rural populations and i s&#13;
retarding recovery o f the rural economy. For many years, public infrastructure has not been&#13;
maintained. Irrigation canals have accumulated sedimentation and in many places structures are&#13;
in need of repair. These conditions reduce water flows and hence agricultural productivity.&#13;
Unpaved provincial and district roads are poorly surfaced and hinder access, even if their total&#13;
length o f about 18,000 km may be adequate given the population's concentration in relatively&#13;
small areas. Some districts have totally lost direct access to markets and social services. The&#13;
3,000 km national paved network, almost circling the high mountains and with spurs to&#13;
neighboring countries, also i s in poor condition. These roads permit only low speeds; often a&#13;
short trip requires an overnight stay-many     rural areas have lost access to the market economy.&#13;
Hence despite long travel distances, non-motorized transport competes with motorized means in&#13;
many parts o f rural Afghanistan. War has not only devastated Afghanistan's existing&#13;
infrastructurebut also prevented maintenance and new investment from talung place-at         present&#13;
infrastructure requirements cover the entire spectrum o f possible interventions, i.e. maintenance,&#13;
rehabilitation, backlog reduction, andnewheplacement.&#13;
&#13;
TheEmergencyRemains-The "Fragile"Post-Conflict Times&#13;
&#13;
7.     Seventeen months after the Bonn Agreement, economic activity in Afghanistan i s showing&#13;
signs o f a start-up. The economy grew by nearly 10 percent last year. Agricultural production this&#13;
year i s projected to grow substantially above a depressed base due to significant rainfall and&#13;
snow, after a prolonged drought. Yet despite positive projections, Afghanistan remains among the&#13;
poorest countries o f the world-projections     indicate that 2003 GDP per capita would still only&#13;
reachUS$175 -US$220.&#13;
&#13;
8.     There is an urgency to ensure that reconstruction and rehabilitation assistance can quickly&#13;
restore assets and production, improve livelihoods, and provide real hope for Afghans.&#13;
Expectations among the population for a "peace dividend" are high, and results on the ground&#13;
need to be deliveredrelatively quickly, otherwise the prospects for further progress and the peace&#13;
process will look dim. This in turns require rapid progress inaddressing major bottlenecks-poor&#13;
security, weak administrative and institutional capacity, non-existent financial systems, weak&#13;
donor coordination-in     order to stimulate economic recovery and growth, and provide holistic&#13;
solutions for improving livelihoods o f the vulnerable Afghan population.&#13;
&#13;
9.     Significant progress has been achieved in starting the reconstruction and development&#13;
effort. Tangible results, in the past 12-1 8 months, include doubling of school enrollment,&#13;
improvements in female enrollment, polio vaccination reaching more than 6 million children,&#13;
improvements in water supply and sanitation in Kabul city, modest improvements in access to&#13;
small scale infrastructure, and increased food production (though primarily due to this year's&#13;
increased precipitation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 10. But results are still far short o f meeting the enormous needs of the Afghan people.&#13;
 Livelihoods continue to be threatened and jobs are needed in the short-run to support the&#13;
vulnerable people, in general, and the returning displaced families and ex-combatants in&#13;
particular. Social indicators are still disma13--e.g., life expectancy, at 43, i s one o f the lowest in&#13;
the world, less than a quarter o f the population has access to safe drinking water, and only a fifth&#13;
have adequate sanitation. Physical access to social and economic services has not improved&#13;
much. The overall road network i s still only partially usable-and              many rural areas are still&#13;
without access to the market economy. Worst o f all, from the point o f view o fthe rejuvenationo f&#13;
the nation state, tangible effects o f the reconstruction effort are not visible to the Afghan people.&#13;
The government needs to reinforce its role in all parts o f the country and be apparent as the&#13;
facilitator o f a positive change.&#13;
&#13;
Cross-Sector Needs And Sector Priorities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Livelihoods and Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
 11. Despite recent improvements in agriculture, employment opportunities in rural areas are&#13;
limited. Border crossing restrictions with Iran and Pakistan have reduced opportunities for&#13;
Afghan migrant labor. Return o f refugees and internally displaced populations continues to&#13;
further stress the labor market. Little opportunity i s being afforded to the reintegration o f ex-&#13;
combatants under these circumstances-and             even less to the vulnerable female and disabled&#13;
population. The resultingrural to urban migration i s also stressing the cities.&#13;
&#13;
 12. Based on experience inthe past eighteen months, there is a large range o fvulnerabilities4-&#13;
both at the individual and household level-including         food insecurity, disease, conscription, asset&#13;
stripping, physical assault, arbitrary detention, and forced displacement. Programs targeting&#13;
single vulnerabilities (such as food, shelter, etc.) are assessedby the Government as not the most&#13;
efficient means to make a timely and wide spread impact. Desperate and irreversible coping&#13;
strategiess are still being employed by many Afghans.&#13;
&#13;
13.    Although food shortages are still being experienced in many parts o f Afghanistan, the&#13;
overall food security has improved. Field evidence suggests that emergency support to livelihood&#13;
reconstruction requires a more holistic approach through methods other than just food aid if&#13;
(estimated) 4-5 million vulnerable Afghans are to rebuild their lives and if the government i s to&#13;
further secure its reach outside Kabul. Investments are needed inbuilding livelihoods approaches&#13;
in multiple relevant sectors, and ensuring proper coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of&#13;
these approaches and actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rural Access&#13;
&#13;
14. Roads and airports provide the basis o f physical access in landlocked Afghanistan. The&#13;
road network comprises about 6,000 km o f national roads o f which 3,300 km are primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Afghanistan Transitional SupportStrategy, The World Bank, March 2003.&#13;
 Addressing Livelihoods in Afghanistan, Adam Pain and Sue Lautze, Issue Paper Series, Afghanistan&#13;
Research and EvaluationUnit,September 2002.&#13;
 These strategies are reflected inthe following trendslinformation gathered during last year's vulnerability&#13;
assessment and mapping by WFP: higher land sales and mortgages; small farmers' indebtedness and&#13;
reliance on larger land owners; distress sales of household assets, tools, farming equipment, and livestock;&#13;
early marriage o fpre-pubescent daughters and indentures o f young boys for labor by families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
highways, including 2,400 km that were originally paved. The national primary road network&#13;
consists mainly o f the ring road (Herat - Kandahar - Kabul - Mazaresharif - Shibergan -&#13;
Maimana - Herat) and six international links to neighboring countries. The 615 km Shibergan -&#13;
Herat section i s only partly constructed and is generally unpaved. The remaining network&#13;
comprising o f 2,700 km secondary national roads, and 15,000 km provincial roads, is either&#13;
gravel or earthen. The tertiary roadnetwork consists o funpaved village access roads.&#13;
&#13;
 15.   More than two decades o f conflict combined with a prolonged lack o f maintenance has&#13;
resulted in damage to long stretches o f roads and to many bridges and other critical structures.&#13;
Overall, the road network has been rendered only partially usable, and that too, at a significantly&#13;
hightransportation cost. Large sections o ftheroads inthe southandeast o fthe countryhavebeen&#13;
lost. Nearly all resources for road construction and maintenance have also been lost.&#13;
&#13;
16.   As a landlocked country and with large mountainous regions, Afghanistan has to rely&#13;
significantly on civil aviation for international and domestic passenger movement as well as for&#13;
the supply o f emergency goods to the remote communities. The civil aviation infrastructure has&#13;
deteriorated extensively during the prolonged conflict. Immediate challenges include removing&#13;
major road transport bottlenecks and re-establishing safe civilian air traffic services to facilitate&#13;
the access o f the rural communities to social and economic services, and the movement o f&#13;
humanitarianaid, returning refugees and trade-related traffic.&#13;
&#13;
Government Response and Strategy for Recovery&#13;
&#13;
17.   The Transitional Government o f Afghanistan has elaborated a clear strategy for the&#13;
country's reconstruction through its National Development Framework (NDF), comprising&#13;
twelve National Programs (Annex 3). This strategy6recognizes the critical importance o fbuilding&#13;
Government institutionsto ensure the success o freconstruction and development efforts.&#13;
&#13;
18.   The Government has emphasized the need to address the root causes of Afghanistan's&#13;
serious humanitarianproblems, not just the symptoms, while recognizing the need for continuing&#13;
humanitarian assistance in the short run. It has advocated a shift from a humanitarian to a&#13;
reconstruction focus, consistent with several related transitions that the government i s seeking,&#13;
including: a) from in-kmdcommodity aid to cash assistance (e.g. from food-for-work to cash-for-&#13;
work); b) from assistance directly to implementing agencies (outside the Government budget) to&#13;
aid that passes through government budget channels; and, c) from assistance that is "sole-&#13;
sourced" to specific entities to transparent, competitive contracting. The government has&#13;
identified good governance as a priority, recognizing the pivotal role o f governance in&#13;
establishing a transparent and accountable government and in enabling private sector&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
19.   The shift from a humanitarian to a longer-term reconstruction and development focus as&#13;
described in the National Development Framework would also enhance government leadership&#13;
and open the way for better alignment o f international assistance with the government's&#13;
reconstruction strategy and budget. The Government i s using the budget to set priorities,&#13;
coordinate donor assistance and to allocate financial resources. It has strengthened processes for&#13;
compiling both the recurrent and multi-year development budgets, as well as for budget&#13;
execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Information on the Government strategy is derived from the NationalDevelopment Framework and other&#13;
Government documents. See http://www.afghanistangov.com&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Donor and Program coordination mechanisms inplace&#13;
&#13;
 20.   The Government i s coordinating donor activities through a comprehensive development&#13;
 fkamework that i s built upon its budget. Consultative Groups have been formed inKabul for key&#13;
 sectors and themes to engage with international assistance partners and to align reconstruction&#13;
programs with Afghanistan's development priorities. Based on principles o f country-ownership&#13;
 and good governance, with a primary emphasis on the role o f the private sector, the Consultative&#13;
 Group process has been well received by the international community. Yet, ensuring that benefits&#13;
 are felt in a timely manner by the entire population o f Afghanistan, particularly by the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, remains a major challenge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Livelihoods and Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
21.    Livelihoods and Social Protection (LSP) i s a major theme inthe first pillar o f the NDF. The&#13;
Government's LSP Program aims to' "enhance human security and support sustainable rural and&#13;
urban livelihoods thereby promoting the elimination o f poverty through enhanced governance".&#13;
The Government realizes that in order to support the livelihoods o f poor people it i s necessary to:&#13;
a) address a wide range o f sectors (agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation, energy,&#13;
transport and communication, natural resource management, human security and safety, etc.); b)&#13;
ensure that the benefits o f growth are inclusive to different groups o f women, men, children and&#13;
young people, and that economic policy takes full account o f diverse vulnerabilities; c) ensure&#13;
that livelihood promotion and social protection are not treated as separate activities; d) coordinate&#13;
actions for delivery o f effective, nationally owned, policies and programs; and, e) ensure&#13;
involvement o fpublic, private, and civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
22.    The primary agencies jointly responsible for delivering the LSP's objectives are the&#13;
Ministries o f Finance (MF), Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), Labor and Social&#13;
Affairs (MLSA), Women Affairs (MWA), Martyrs and Disabled (MMD), Frontiers and Tribal&#13;
Affairs (MFTA), and the National Disaster and Risk Management Authority (NDRMA). These&#13;
Ministries havejointly submitted the LSP Public Investment Program (PIP) for SY 1382-1384 as&#13;
part o f the National Development Budget (NDB). In addition, the Ministries o f Public Works&#13;
(MPW) and o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE) are also actively&#13;
executingLSP interventions inthe form o f workfare programs.&#13;
&#13;
23.    Within the LSP program, national strategies and policy frameworks are being formulated&#13;
inthe following areas in 1382: Targeted Social Protection; Disaster Management; Reintegration&#13;
of Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); National Emergency Employment&#13;
Program; Micro-Enterprise Development; Micro-Finance; Promotion o f Pastoralist Livelihoods;&#13;
and, Promotion o f Alternative Livelihoods in Poppy Growing Areas'.               Work in these areas i s&#13;
planned inthe investment budget through several sub-programs (Annex 4A).&#13;
&#13;
24.    The National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) i s the main investment for targeted&#13;
social protection for vulnerable groups inthe LSP public investment program (Annex 4B). NEEP&#13;
i s meant to provide a timely, efficient, self-targeting, and widespread, cash-for-work based social&#13;
safety net.    NEEP activities will involve a wide range o f sectors (roads, irrigation, urban&#13;
''NDFCode    1.4: Livelihoods and Social Protection Public Investment Program (SY 1382-1384)&#13;
  Whilst ruralrecovery programs will promote the development o f alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers&#13;
and workers, a coordinated strategy that phases law enforcement interventions together with initiatives&#13;
contributing to alternative livelihood promotion will have a more significant impact. Sub-program No. 5 o f&#13;
the SY 1382-1384 PIP specifically targets this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development, natural resource management, soil conservation, reforestation) and themes&#13;
(targeting women and disabled); and include capacity building to ensure effective planning,&#13;
delivery, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Inaddition to NEEP, anumber of other activities will be central to social protection. These&#13;
include the protection o f children and young people, continuing development o f the National&#13;
Livelihoods Based Surveillance System through capacity building activities at the central and&#13;
provincial level, stakeholder consultations on the national vulnerability assessment, winterization&#13;
initiatives, food aid targeting, the development o f a national strategy for social protection, and&#13;
strengthening o f disaster management coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rural Access&#13;
&#13;
26.     Rural access infrastructure lends itself well to large-scale workfare programs, and i s&#13;
therefore one o f the key sector investment sub-programs under the Government's NEEP. In&#13;
addition to its short-term employment benefits, investment in rural access infrastructure creates&#13;
assets that will have a lasting poverty reduction impact by improving access o f the rural poor to&#13;
economic opportunities and to basic services. These longer-term benefits can be enhanced and&#13;
made more sustainable if workfare programs are made an integral part o f a coherent rural access&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
27.     A rural access strategy for Afghanistan has yet to be formalized, but efforts are underway&#13;
both under the NEEP (with the adoption o f integrated rural access planning approaches), and&#13;
more broadly in the context o f an overall transport sector policy, which the Government i s&#13;
preparing, with Bank assistance provided under the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
approved by the Board inFY03.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Once the Government has formulated and adopted a vision and strategic plan for transport,&#13;
programs o f prioritized actions (policy changes, institutional development and capacity building)&#13;
and investments can readily be prepared and initiated. This should be done in an integrated&#13;
manner using a common framework for all transport modes and sub-sectors. It will, however,&#13;
take time to formulate and build consensus on a new policy framework, modify legislation and&#13;
regulations, and reorganize the sector. Meanwhile, existing government structures need to focus&#13;
on the implementation o f emergency repairs and rehabilitation work and related maintenance,&#13;
while preparing for more fundamental policy and organizational changes appropriate for each&#13;
sub-sector.&#13;
&#13;
29.    Inthe short term, a Core Network Repairs and Stabilization strategy has been adopted by&#13;
the government to implement fast track projects aiming at removing critical bottlenecks&#13;
(collapsed bridges, disintegrated pavements, damaged tunnels, unsafe air traffic operations). This&#13;
strategy i s meant to rapidly restore normal traffic operations on key road arteries and inthe air, in&#13;
order to facilitate trade, humanitarian aid, reconstruction efforts in all sectors, and economic&#13;
integration. The related road works would also generate employment. The rural access program&#13;
under the NEEP will play an important part in this strategy, complementing other Government&#13;
transport programs focusing on the rehabilitation o f trunk roads, urban streets, civil aviation, and&#13;
customs posts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The National Emergencv Employment Program&#13;
&#13;
30.    During the last few years, various labor-intensive cash-for-work and food-for-work&#13;
infrastructure works projects have been implemented by multiple donors and NGOs. While these&#13;
interventions have mostly achieved their safety net objectives by creating much-needed&#13;
employment, their success in creating lasting infrastructure assets has been more uneven. Insome&#13;
cases, the assets created have been o f uneven quality, their delivery not appropriately prioritized,&#13;
and contracting and financing mechanisms have not been efficient. The Government i s trying to&#13;
build on the experience o f these projects while addressing their shortcomings by developing a&#13;
coherent planning, design and implementation framework under the NEEP, and encouraging&#13;
donors to channel funds through this framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
31.   The purpose o f the NEEP i s to (a) provide a safety net for vulnerable people by creating&#13;
productive employment opportunities, and (b) establish effective mechanisms for developing&#13;
infrastructure assets, through labor-based (Annex 5) methods and based on a private sector-led&#13;
approach. The Government i s implementing, and will continue to implement, NEEP through all&#13;
the concerned sector ministries and by developing replicable models and mechanisms to achieve&#13;
NEEP objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Budget Execution&#13;
&#13;
32.   Funding, resource allocation and the implementation o f projects under NEEP will follow&#13;
Government execution modalities. A funding mechanism through the national budget will be&#13;
established to ensure that funds are allocated in accordance with Government policies related to&#13;
social targeting, sector priorities, and geographical distribution. This framework will provide a&#13;
focused and transparent mechanismfor donors to contribute financial resources to specific sectors&#13;
and program areas that support Government priorities. The budget flowing through this&#13;
framework will be gradually expanded over the coming years, in concurrence with the&#13;
Government's management capacity. During the initial year, this framework will be mainly used&#13;
to correct resource allocation imbalances that result from insufficiently coordinated programs&#13;
funded through multiple donor channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NEEP Institutional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
33.   A National Inter-Ministerial Board (NIB)9will oversee the NEEP. The Board will be&#13;
chaired by the Minister for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and include representatives o f&#13;
other participating Ministers. The Board will be responsible for: (a) directing policy and strategy;&#13;
(b) resource allocation and programming; (c) project approval against agreed criteria inline with&#13;
national development priorities; (d) establishing appropriate financial modalities; (e) approval o f&#13;
the oversight mechanism for effective resource management; and (f) supervision o f the Joint&#13;
ProgramManagement Unit (JPMU).&#13;
&#13;
34.   A Joint Program Management Unit, reporting to the inter-ministerial Board, will be&#13;
responsible for the daily management o f the Program. Its main roles and functions will be to: (a)&#13;
establish and maintain effective coordination systems; (b) manage the programming/resource&#13;
allocation mechanisms; (c) develop methods, standards and tools for programming, planning,&#13;
&#13;
 Please refer to Annex 11for a proposed compositionand structure o fNIB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation, and monitoring and evaluation; and (d) help build capacity within the&#13;
Government to implement NEEP. Qualified national and intemational agencies (and/or&#13;
individuals) will provide support through the Unit in the areas o f social process management,&#13;
community mobilization and capacity building, engineering,              contracting and financial&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Government's request to the Bank&#13;
&#13;
35.     The Government attaches high priority to the NEEP, and sees the Bank as a key&#13;
knowledge and financing partner in the program's implementation. In its public investment&#13;
program, the Government has allocated US$53.5m for the NEEP in the current fiscal year (SY&#13;
1382).&#13;
&#13;
36.    Out o f this, US$25.4m is funded from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF&#13;
NEEP-1Project signed in March 2003)-however,           there is a possibility that some part o f this&#13;
NEEP-1 commitment-up          to US$lOm-may     either be delayed or canceled due to paucity o f&#13;
funds inthe ARTF. Additional fundinghas beenrequested from IDA under the proposedProject,&#13;
which focuses on the rural access sub-sector o f the NEEP. Inparallel, the Government will seek&#13;
to interest other donors in supporting employment generation programs in other sectors under the&#13;
NEEP. To coordinate the overall program, the Government has also requested IDA to support&#13;
capacity building o f the NEEP JPMU. This project i s being prepared in response to these&#13;
requests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        B. BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37.    The World Bank responded initially to Afghanistan's reconstruction needs through&#13;
participation in a Needs Assessment carried out jointly with ADB and UNDP, which has led to a&#13;
program o f financial assistance and deepening advisory services. It has supported strategies in&#13;
different sectors, particularly through four IDA grants, totaling U S $ lOOm, which were approved&#13;
by the Board in FY 2002 for public administration, infrastructure reconstruction, community&#13;
driven development, labor intensive public works, and education.&#13;
&#13;
38.    A new TSS for Afghanistan was presented to the Board inMarch2003. The reconstruction&#13;
strategy developed by the Government, and embodied in its National Development Framework&#13;
(NDF) and national budget, forms the framework for this TSS. The new TSS puts forward&#13;
priorities for Bank assistance based on the areas o f comparative advantage o f the Bank and where&#13;
other donors are engaged, in line with a Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF)&#13;
approach. Under this strategy, which also begins the transition from a short-run emergency&#13;
orientationto a longer-term development orientation, the Bank will focus on four areas.&#13;
&#13;
           Improving Livelihoods: employment generation, community development, and the rural&#13;
           economy including water resources management.&#13;
           Fiscal Strategy, Institutions, Management: budget, role o f Ministry o fFinance, revenue&#13;
           and expenditure arrangements, central-local fiscal framework.&#13;
           Governance and Public Administration Reform: role o f state, financial transparency,&#13;
           good governance o fpublic administration, civil service reform.&#13;
           Enabling Private Sector Development: business climate, financial sector, infi-astructure,&#13;
           regulation, and trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 39.   Based on the Government's identified priorities, the TSS includes project assistance to the&#13;
 Government in scaling-up the implementationo f the NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
BankSupport to the NEEP&#13;
&#13;
40.    Inlate 2002, the Bank supported a first NEEP initiative by financing labor-intensive road&#13;
 sub-projects on a pilot basis. This was funded through a component o f the FY02 IDA Grant for&#13;
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP). The pilot i s&#13;
focused on rural road repairs and i s being successfully implemented. IDA supervision missions&#13;
have visited sub-project sites in several provinces and found the quality o f works to be good and&#13;
the labor selectiodemployment mechanisms to be robust. Some further improvements are being&#13;
made based on this early experience, with active support from monthly IDA supervision.&#13;
Additional financing for the NEEP, including expansion o f the rural roads program and pilot&#13;
labor-based investments in irrigation, was mobilized through the ARTF. Given the successful&#13;
startup o f the program, the magnitude o f the financing and capacity support needed to scale it up&#13;
to all provinces, and the NEEP's pivotal role in the Government's social protection strategy,&#13;
further Bank engagement i s identified as a priority area inthe TSS.&#13;
&#13;
41.    Under the on-going IDA funded ECEPWP's public works component, and the ARTF&#13;
financed NEEP-1, US$42.6m o f approved financing i s under execution for the NEEP. It i s&#13;
expected that this funding will be entirely committed to sub-projects by August, 2003. In all&#13;
likelihood, some part-up     to US$lOm--of      the ARTF financing for NEEP-1 may either be&#13;
delayed or cancelled, due to the immense demands on the ARTF funds. To keep the program's&#13;
momentum and its credibility in the provinces, and avoid funding gaps which would cause restart&#13;
costs and delays, further financing should be programmed now. The proposed Project will&#13;
provide this supplementary financing (US$39.2m), and help buildup the overall capacity o f the&#13;
NEEP's management unit in planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation for the&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements and impacts to-date&#13;
&#13;
42.   A total o f US$7.91m (46 percent) has been disbursed under the ECEPWP labor-intensive&#13;
public works component. The component includes two sub-components, one for secondary roads&#13;
executed by MPW with United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) as implementation&#13;
partner, and another (multi-sector, but with about 70 percent expected to be spent on rural road&#13;
subprojects) executed by MRRD with implementation support provided by CARE and other&#13;
NGOs. Implementationo f the MPW subcomponent started inJanuary 2003. Since then, US$3.8m&#13;
(out o f US$8.75m available under the component) have been committed to 193 rural road repair&#13;
subprojects, now under implementation in 18 provinces. These sub-projects, directly contracted&#13;
with communities, have an average completion period o f 3 months, average cost just under&#13;
US$20,000, and average labor content o f 70-80 percent. They are expected to generate 1.52&#13;
million person-days o f employment, and will repair 2,3 16 km o f rural roads. This i s satisfactory&#13;
progress in four months. Disbursements and employment creation under this component are&#13;
expected to accelerate substantially, as a batch o f larger sub-projects (average cost of&#13;
US$lOO,OOO) contracted competitively to local area contractors and NGOs, are just getting&#13;
underway. The US$5m MRRD subcomponent i s also progressing well, with over 75 percent o f&#13;
the funds already committed, and completion expectedby August 2003,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43.    Additional grant funding of US$25.4m from the ARTF was committed in March 2003.&#13;
This financing    includes US$3.4m for a pilot program of labor intensive repair and rehabilitation&#13;
works on irrigation systems, implemented by MIWRE.The main component, for US$22m, will&#13;
finance rural road works, to be executed by MPW with UNOPS as Implementation Partner, and&#13;
incoordination with MRRD.The contract betweenMPW andUNOPS hasbeensigned, and sub-&#13;
projects are expected to start within a month's time. There i s a provision in this contract for&#13;
UNOPS to support some limited start-up costs for the NEEP's joint program management unit&#13;
(JPMU). The JPMU has already been established and has started working, initially with ILO&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
44.    Projections based on the current rate of progress indicate that the remainder of the&#13;
ECEPWP funds available for labor-intensive works will be committed within the next 2 months,&#13;
and that the funds available under the ARTF NEEP-1 for rural road sub-projects from the&#13;
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) will be fully committed by the end of August&#13;
2003. Additional funds are requiredto continue the programbeyond August.&#13;
&#13;
45.    Together, the available IDA and the ARTF funds are projected to provide nearly 8 million&#13;
person-days o f labor by undertaking 763 sub-projects that will repair nearly 5,740 km of rural&#13;
roads and tracks. The projecteddelivery cost to the government of the NEEP pilot is expected to&#13;
be around US$ 1,500-2,500 per labor-year o f employment provided, which compares favorably&#13;
with similar programs inother post-conflict countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lessons from Early NEEP Experience&#13;
&#13;
46.    Some areas for improvement have been identified during IDA supervision of the NEEP&#13;
component under ECEPWP. More work needs to be done to ensure that wage levels are set&#13;
appropriately, primarily to enable self-targeting of vulnerable groups. The system o f project&#13;
selection, while being relatively transparent, needs to be strengthened in order to improve&#13;
targeting. The program also requires the support of a more rigorous vulnerability assessment".&#13;
The entire sub-project labor employment cycle, while assessed as being satisfactory, could be&#13;
further improvedby addingdetails inthe project implementationmanualregardinglabor payment&#13;
methods and timeliness, safeguarding labor intensity; and, monitoring labor selection and&#13;
rotation.&#13;
&#13;
47.    The quality o f works, and the maintenance and rehabilitation strategies in use, need to be&#13;
improved to increase the sustainability o f the assets produced. Cross-drainage structures-such&#13;
as bridges, culverts, and causeways-are          a key to sustainability o f access improvements. Repair&#13;
of these structures i s often not incorporated inthe sub-projects due to their highercosts and lesser&#13;
labor intensity. Repairs o f cross-drainage structures should be included in the road repairs sub-&#13;
projects to increase sustainability and appropriate labor-based equipment supported technologies&#13;
should be applied to achieve, both, highlevels o f labor input and minimumlife cycle costs. The&#13;
repaired roads need to be handed over to the accountable administration, and their maintenance&#13;
included infuture budgets (providing opportunities for second-round employmentbenefits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loThe revisionto World FoodProgram (WFP) 2002 Vulnerability Assessment Mapping is underway for&#13;
2003. AREU along with WFP, MRRD, and other stakeholders, including the Bank, are providing inputs to&#13;
revisioninthe field data collection methodology, to improve the quality o f data collected and for better&#13;
assessing the vulnerabilities and risks facing the Afghan society, This revised data collection exercise will&#13;
be carried out from August 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48.    A significant share of the road works executed in the pilot stage consists of spot&#13;
improvements such as pothole filling, drain repairdreshaping, surface leveling, etc. While such&#13;
interventions are highly labor-intensive, low cost, and effective in enabling motor-able access,&#13;
the repairs may last only 6-12 months. Over time, and as capacity develops, such repair and&#13;
maintenance works should become part of a maintenance program funded from sustainedrevenue&#13;
streams, such as user charges collected in a road fund. Under its emerging transport policy&#13;
formulation process, the Government has shown interest in designing and building such long-&#13;
term institutional arrangements, but it would be unrealistic to expect them to be in place at the&#13;
current stage of Afghanistan's reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
49.    While limiting the sub-projects to roads i s sound, other sectors can be targeted in future for&#13;
such works equally effectively. Rural road works allow for relatively fast implementation, and&#13;
employ more unskilled labor than most other public works-in              contrast with say building&#13;
construction, which would require extensive inputs from artisans and sktlled labor. Based on the&#13;
experience gained inECEPWP, it was found more effective to focus the proposed Project on this&#13;
sector only. Includingother sectors such as large-scale irrigation programs would have required&#13;
substantial preparation time to design effective implementation arrangements and address the&#13;
institutional, social and environmental issues specific to these sectors. However, by strengthening&#13;
the JPMU, in charge of the overall NEEP, the project will indirectly help build capacity for&#13;
similar programs in other sectors. The Government has expressed interest in future IDA&#13;
involvement innon-roadprograms of the NEEP, especially inthe irrigation sector.&#13;
&#13;
50.   Other lessons from IDA'S early experience with NEEP include the need for targeted&#13;
employment opportunities for women and disabled in the sub-projects; and a need to strengthen&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, including through an improved MIS. These lessons are incorporated&#13;
inthe proposedProject, inparticularthrougharevisedProjectImplementationManual.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
51, The government considers the Bank to be a key partner through provision of advice based&#13;
on it's global experience of social funds and post-conflict reconstruction, and through finance to&#13;
support its livelihoods and social protectionprograms.&#13;
&#13;
52.   Through its involvement inECEPWP, the Bank has already gained operational experience&#13;
indevelopingmechanisms to deliver such a social protection program inAfghanistan, whichhas&#13;
been incorporated into the design of this project. The Bank, together with the European&#13;
Commission, i s also the focal point nominatedby the government for the Consultative Group on&#13;
Livelihoods and Social Protection program, which i s chaired by the MRRD.(Annex 6 provides&#13;
details about the CDF basedConsultative Groups structure.)&#13;
&#13;
53.   The Bank has substantial experience o f similar emergency social protectionprograms using&#13;
labor-intensive public works in other post conflict countries (among others East Timor, Bosnia-&#13;
Herzegovina, West Bank and Gaza), and in the monitoring and evaluation of Active Labor&#13;
Market Programs (ALMP).&#13;
&#13;
54.   The proposed project is in line with the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) presented in&#13;
March 2003 to the Executive Directors. The TSS highlightsImproving Livelihoods as one of four&#13;
pillars o f Bank assistanceto Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;

                          C. DETAILEDPROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
55.    The proposed National Emergency Employment Program for Rural Access (NEEPRA)&#13;
project aims to assist the Government in providing targeted social protection, and in the&#13;
improvement o f key rural access infrastructure, for improving livelihoods o f the rural poor in&#13;
Afghanistan through: (i) provision o f emergency short-term employment opportunities for the&#13;
                            the&#13;
poor on labor-based rural access infrastructure improvement subprojects; and, (ii)             technical&#13;
assistance for the implementation o f NEEP. A secondary objective o f the project i s to repair key&#13;
rural access infrastructure and assist the Government inmobilizing donor support for its National&#13;
Emergency Employment Program. The project will achieve this objective through labor-based&#13;
rural access infrastructure subprojects, and technical assistance to the NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project Performance Indicators&#13;
&#13;
56.    To track project performance, a set of indicators havebeen identified duringappraisal. Key&#13;
indicators include days o f employment provided; total cost per labor-year o f employment&#13;
provided; km o f roads repaired; number and length o fbridges and culverts repaired; and, amount&#13;
of incremental nonBank funds channeled through NEEP. A detailed list o f indicators i s provided&#13;
inAnnex 7.&#13;
&#13;
57.    The Credit portion will finance the reconstruction o f secondary rural access&#13;
infrastructure-primarily     bridges. The Grant will finance the rehabilitation o f tertiary rural access&#13;
infrastructure and technical assistance to the Government for implementing the NEEP. The&#13;
Project is expected to create a minimumo f 6,000,000 unskilled labor days o f employment, and to&#13;
rehabilitate a minimumo f 2,000 kmo f ruralroads and 2,300 mo fbridges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Project:NationalEmergencyEmploymentProgramfor RuralAccess (NEEPRA)&#13;
&#13;
58.      The project development objective will be achieved by: a) the creation o f productive,&#13;
self-targeting, emergency employment opportunities in maintenance and rehabilitation o f the&#13;
rural access infrastructure, b) using appropriate labor-intensive methods in order to ensure high&#13;
labor content o f the works to be financed, yet at the same time trying to improve the quality and&#13;
extend the life o f the infrastructure produced; and c) buildingcapacity o f JPMU to implement and&#13;
manage the NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
59.    The Government wishes to allocate the Credit and Grant proceeds distinctly-while&#13;
recognizing that in principle funds are fungible-to       ensure that Credit proceeds target more&#13;
sustainable infrastructure rehabilitationheconstruction and that the Grant proceeds are targeted&#13;
towards achieving greater direct social impact. Therefore the entire Credit portion o f the Project&#13;
financing will be spent on reconstructiodrehabilitation o f larger, more sustainable secondary/&#13;
primary rural access infrastructure-primarily    bridges. While the Grant will fund components o f&#13;
the project with immediate/direct social impact, i.e., more labor intensive works, and technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 60.    The project will comprise two components: A) labor-based rural access sub-projects; and,&#13;
B) technical assistance to support the Government's overall National Emergency Employment&#13;
Program (NEEP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Component A: Labor-basedRuralAccess Infrastructure(LJS$34.2m)&#13;
&#13;
 61. This component will finance sub-projects for labor-based maintenance and rehabilitationo f&#13;
rural access infrastructure-primarily        secondary and tertiary roads, bridges and other cross-&#13;
drainage infrastructure associated with these roads. These sub-projects will be spread over all&#13;
provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub-componentA (I):Sub-projects Grants for tertian rural access infrastructure (US$13.8m)&#13;
&#13;
62.    This sub-component will finance sub-project grants (US$11.Om) for maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation o f tertiary access infrastructure, and will be implemented by MRRD. This sub-&#13;
component will also finance consulting services, training and audit, equipment and goods, and&#13;
incremental operating costs to implement the sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub-componentA (2): Sub-projects Grants for secondaw rural access infrastructure (US$20.4m)&#13;
&#13;
63,    This sub-component will finance sub-project grants (US$15.3m) for secondary rural access&#13;
infrastructure in all provinces and will be implemented by MPW. This sub-component will also&#13;
finance consulting services, training and audit, equipment and goods, and incremental operating&#13;
costs to implement the sub-projects. As part o f the goods, this component will also finance&#13;
provision and erection o f removable bridges (approximately US$l.3m)-these               will be used for&#13;
restoration o f rural access at critical locations where, e.g., the expected construction costs (and&#13;
project durations) for permanent bridge structures are beyond the scope o f this project.               A&#13;
preliminary list o f proposed bridges received from Ministry o f Public Works i s attached in&#13;
Annex-9.&#13;
&#13;
Component B: TechnicalAssistancefor theNEEP(LJS$S.Om)&#13;
&#13;
64.    The TA component will finance technical assistance services, studies, surveys, training and&#13;
audit, incremental operating costs, goods and works to establish and strengthen the NEEP's&#13;
JPMUand its provincial structures.&#13;
&#13;
65.    The project will finance a NEEP Coordinator who will manage the JPMU, and will be&#13;
assisted by a team o f international and national specialists. The team will be comprised o f&#13;
specialists on (i)Social Protection and Gender; (ii)          Planning, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation; (iii)&#13;
Roads/Transport Engineering and Contracts Management; (iv) Irrigation and Environmental&#13;
Engineering; (v) Management Information Systems; and (vi) Training. In addition to the&#13;
international TA, national consultant staff will be recruited under the project in the fields o f&#13;
Management Information Systems (2 staff) and training (1 staff). Government counterpart staff&#13;
will be assigned by the participating line ministries. Preliminary TOR o f the key Specialists" are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
''These  TOR are not as per the final agreed skills midjob-descriptions contained inthe text here. These&#13;
are indicative TOR that will be consolidated and finalized into the seven TOR required for the NEEP&#13;
JPMUspecialists-including     the JPMU Coordinator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 attached in Annex 10. These TOR will be finalized with the Government before their final&#13;
 procurement.&#13;
&#13;
 66.   The Project TA will assist in the establishment o f provincial support structures for&#13;
 implementation o f the NEEP. At the provincial level, MRRD will assign Provincial NEEP&#13;
 Coordinators (PNCs) who will be responsible for the coordination and monitoring o f NEEP&#13;
 activities in the provinces. Advisors (national) to the PNCs will be recruited under the Project,&#13;
 with each advisor coveringfour provinces (eight intotal).&#13;
&#13;
 67.   The TA will also assist the JPMU in the identification, design and implementation o f&#13;
 surveys and studies that will be requiredto further develop the NEEP strategy and its operational&#13;
procedures and guidelines. Studies and surveys being considered for fundingunder Component B&#13;
of the Project include (i)studies to determine appropriate wage rate levels; (ii)   transport studies&#13;
for planning and assessment o f the impacts o f interventions under NEEP; (iii)studies to&#13;
determine appropriate labor productivity norms; (iv) inventories o f the rural roads network and&#13;
the irrigation infrastructure and their condition; (v) studies o f livelihoods strategies and coping&#13;
mechanisms o f pastoralists, to enable a more effective targeting o f this vulnerable group under&#13;
NEEP; (vi) monitoring and evaluation surveys to assess the effectiveness o f the NEEP strategies&#13;
and operational procedures and to provide an input in further refining and modifying them; (vii)&#13;
development o f an integrated rural access planning approach for Afghanistan; and (viii)&#13;
translation o f key labor-based techniques and IRAP into local languages and their introduction&#13;
into the curriculum o f technical universities inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 D. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68.    The project will be implemented over a 39 month period, with the expectation o f faster&#13;
implementation in most provinces. Two ministries will lead the implementation o f this project:&#13;
MRRDandMPW.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA: Labor-basedRuralAccess Infrastructure(US$34.2m)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component A (I):Sub-uroiects Grants-for tertiary rural access infrastructure (US$l3.8ml&#13;
&#13;
69.    This sub-component will be implementedbythe MRRD.MRRDwill utilize the services of&#13;
an implementation consultant, ina manner similar to the arrangement between MPW and UNOPS&#13;
for implementation o f the labor-based roads repair component o f the existing ECEPW project. In&#13;
this arrangement, the implementation consultant (to be contracted by MRRD)will facilitate sub-&#13;
project identification, carry out surveys, bid out works and make payments to communities and&#13;
small contractors. The implementation consultant will work in close collaboration with the staff&#13;
o f MRRDat the central, provincial, and local levels.&#13;
&#13;
70.    The overall allocations to the provinces will be decided by the NEEP's Board, after detailed&#13;
consultations based on poverty and vulnerability, population, security, accessibility, and other&#13;
relevant parameters. Once the allocation per province has been decided, the sub-projects will be&#13;
identified through a consultative mechanism involving the MRRD, the JPMU, the Provincial and&#13;
District Administration, and communities-but       always with basic consideration to the fact that&#13;
the selected sub-project should target the poorest and most vulnerable areas, should provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 employment/labor opportunities to communities in the vicinity o f the sub-project, and should&#13;
 maximize economic and social returns to the target communities.&#13;
&#13;
 71.   For selecting the implementation consultant (IC) for this component, MRRD will invite&#13;
proposals from two or more UNAgencies'* involved in such operation services in Afghanistan,&#13;
 and select the Agency that can effectively and rapidly scale up its operations in Afghanistan in&#13;
 order to ensure that sub-projects implementation i s not delayed and employment benefits can&#13;
reach the poor inthe shortest possible time. An additional selection criteria will be the quality o f&#13;
the UN Agency's team in terms o f its ability to maximize the delivery o f employment benefits&#13;
without compromising the quality/sustainability o f the infrastructure repaired. Based on the&#13;
assessment of the appraisal mission, it i s most likely that UNOPS and the International&#13;
Organization for Migration (IOM) will be the two Agencies requestedto submit proposals for this&#13;
assignment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub-comuonent A (2): Sub-proiects Grants for secondagi rural access infrastructure KJS$20,4m)&#13;
&#13;
72.    This sub-component will be implementedby the MPW. MPW will utilize the services o f an&#13;
implementation consultant as described above for sub-component A(1). M P W has proposed&#13;
continuingwith UNOPS for implementing the proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
73.    The experience with UNOPS to date, under the existing ECEPW project, has been&#13;
satisfactory. Prior to having started disbursements to UNOPS, IDA reviewed and provided no&#13;
objection to the use o f the operating guidelines and procedures o fUNOPS (including for financial&#13;
management and disbursements), for activities executed by them. This arrangement addresses the&#13;
disbursement bottlenecks related to the nascent banking services in Afghanistan. Direct payments&#13;
to UNOPS allows expedient and timely disbursements and project payments to contractors.&#13;
UNOPS has been working well with MPW and has carried out extensive training o f M P W&#13;
counterpart staff. One o f its achievements to date under the ECEPW project has been to revive&#13;
the Design Unit in MPW. Counterpart MPW Engineers are carrying out surveys and preparing&#13;
designs for most o f the larger labor-based public works. UNOPS engineers work closely with&#13;
their MPW counterparts, both inthe center and inthe provinces.&#13;
&#13;
74.    The overall allocations to the provinces and the selection o f sub-projects will be decided on&#13;
the basis o f the Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (RAP) technique (Annex S), or a similar&#13;
technique, by the NEEP EMU.The final decision on the sub-projects to be undertaken will be&#13;
taken by the NEEP National Inter-ministerial Board, the Provincial and District Administrations,&#13;
and will incorporate results o f prior community consultations.&#13;

75.    To provide an effective framework for coordination and decision-making, an Inter-&#13;
ministerial Board (the NIB)has been established and i s awaiting cabinet endorsement. The Board&#13;
i s expected to be the Govemment's mandated body for policy development and decision-making&#13;
for the NEEP. The Joint Program Management Unit will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;

81. NEEPRA Project i s a subset o f the Government's NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social TargetingIssues&#13;
&#13;
82.      Social targeting will happen during a) the overall geographic resource allocation, b) the&#13;
sub-project selection, and c) sub-project implementation. At the sub-project level, the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
targeting mechanism will be wage rate-within        reasonable limits. The wage rate will be based on&#13;
prevailing wage rates for unskilled agricultural labor during the agricultural slack season, to&#13;
promote self-targeting to the most needy. This will be coupled with other strategies to incorporate&#13;
women and the disabled where possible. Based on these approaches, the project i s expected to&#13;
have a satisfactory level o f social targeting.&#13;
&#13;
83.    However, social targeting will need to continuously improve during the course o f&#13;
implementation. A number o f resource allocation and targeting issues are presented in the&#13;
following paragraphs. These issues will be monitored during implementation and may lead to&#13;
changes inimplementationmechanisms as required.&#13;
&#13;
84.    Although various vulnerability assessments have been conducted in Afghanistan,&#13;
uncertainty remains about their accuracy. These assessments predominantly focused on food&#13;
security aspects o f vulnerability and left out important other aspects. For example, the adaptation&#13;
o f livelihood strategies in the present unsettled situation i s not reflected in the existing&#13;
vulnerability analysis nor is coherent information available about actual needs and preferences o f&#13;
the targeted vulnerable groups. The lack o f accurate and complete information, and o f an&#13;
effective targeting strategy, are constraints to the effectiveness o f the present social protection&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Vulnerability Assessment&#13;
&#13;
85.    A precondition for an effective social targeting strategy i s a database that provides the&#13;
information required. Comprehensive vulnerability assessments are expected to be undertaken on&#13;
a yearly basis within the framework o f the recently established National Livelihoods and Social&#13;
Protection Surveillance System. Through these assessments, information on key indicators o f&#13;
vulnerability will be collected. This includes quantitative indicators o f accessibility to&#13;
infrastructure facilities, services and assets. To the extent that this information becomes available,&#13;
it will form the basis for the programming and resource allocation, in combination with data on&#13;
the geographical distribution o f the population in general and o f the targeted vulnerable groups in&#13;
particular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ResourceAllocation&#13;
&#13;
86.    To avoid inequity in resource allocation, projects under NEEP will be initially targeted to&#13;
those areas that are not yet served by other major programs (such as the National Solidarity&#13;
Program which provides block grants and technical support to communities, and the National&#13;
Area-Based Development Program). To ensure an equitable distribution o f NEEP's available&#13;
resources among the targeted beneficiaries, specific resource allocating formulae will be used.&#13;
The data on food-insecure population, district-wise and province-wise, available with the World&#13;
Food Program (WFP), will be assessed for integrity and used as a proxy tool to estimate&#13;
vulnerable populations by province and to help determine NEEP allocations by province. Subject&#13;
to the availability o f data, similar formulae would be used for resource allocation within the&#13;
districts o f a province.&#13;
&#13;
87.    To ensure an appropriate balance between NEEP's social objective and its infrastructure&#13;
development objective, it i s envisaged that on average at least 60% o f NEEP's investment&#13;
resources per province should be allocated for the payment o f wages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Equal Opportunity andAccess to Jobs&#13;
&#13;
88.   Core principles in developing effective social targeting mechanisms relate to the principles&#13;
o f equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work o f equal value. These principles&#13;
have to be translated into practical guidelines that especially target the most vulnerable people.&#13;
These include the disabled and handicapped, returnees, IDPs, pastoralists, female-headed&#13;
households, the elderly and destitute women. Women are also often excluded from public labor-&#13;
based projects because o f religious and traditional norms and values (refer to Annex 13). To&#13;
promote the participation o f these groups inNEEP projects, the followingmeasures are proposed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0    There will be national-level resource allocations o f NEEP's budget for wages to&#13;
          vulnerable groups. The proposed allocations reflect currently available data on the&#13;
           composition o f the most vulnerable groups:&#13;
            o   510% to vulnerable disabled men and women who can participate inthe works;&#13;
            o   5% to vulnerable disabled men and women who cannot participate inthe works;&#13;
            o   5% to vulnerable pastoralists;&#13;
            o   5% to vulnerable returnees;&#13;
            o   510% to destitute women and other vulnerable female-headed households;&#13;
            o   65-75% to vulnerable able-bodied men and women, including ex-combatants.&#13;
&#13;
          These are minimums rather than absolute targets. These minimums may be modified&#13;
          basedon analysis o f vulnerability data being collected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   To promote participation o f women and disabled under NEEP, at least 20 percent o f&#13;
          funds at the district level may be earmarked for activities involving exclusively women&#13;
          and disabled people. Some examples o f activities where women and certain groups o f&#13;
          disabled can participate, are:&#13;
            o   Routine maintenance o f tertiary and secondary roads;&#13;
            o   Preparing dressed stones for road paving within a confined compound in the&#13;
                village;&#13;
            o   Weaving gabion mattresses for gabion boxes within a confined compound inthe&#13;
                village;&#13;
            o   Supervision o f the labor gangs;&#13;
            o   AssistingGovernment staffwith surveys and measurements;&#13;
            o   Keeping attendance registers and muster rolls o f the labor-force;&#13;
            o   Storekeeping for construction materials and tools;&#13;
            o   Managing tree nurseries that supply seedlings for forestation or soil conservation&#13;
                activities; and&#13;
            o   Plantationand care-taking o f seedlings.&#13;
&#13;
89.   Equal opportunity in access to jobs can only be achieved if the targeted population i s well&#13;
informed about the possibilities and conditions o f employment, highlighting the need for an&#13;
information &amp; communication campaign.&#13;
&#13;
90.   Transparency in recruitment procedures i s expected to reflect the principle o f equal&#13;
opportunities in access. If there are more job seekers than jobs, a monthly job rotation can be&#13;
applied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Timing, Scale and Location of Activities&#13;
&#13;
91.   Proper timing and scaling o f activities are important considerations inrelation to the social&#13;
targeting objective o f NEEP. The Program should not compete with other demands for casual&#13;
labor. During the agricultural peak season, ministries and their implementation consultants will&#13;
have to assess the local situation o f labor supply vis-&amp;vis requirements. If necessary, operations&#13;
should be scaled down duringthis period or even be suspended.&#13;
&#13;
92.   Works are to be located in the vicinity o f the areas where the targeted population lives, in&#13;
order not to increase the suffering o f vulnerable populations. Experience indicates that works&#13;
should be locatedwithin a radius o f 5-8 kilometers from the targeted community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 WageRates and Payments&#13;
&#13;
93.   Wage rates and payment modalities constitute important social targeting instruments. Ifthe&#13;
wage rates are set too high, the social targeting objective would not be achieved (refer to Annex&#13;
13). High wage rates lead to excess demand for employment opportunity and this leads to&#13;
rationing. Rationing i s problematic as it can lead to unfair practices. If the rates are set too low,&#13;
productivities may decrease and the Program may not achieve sufficient infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation. Wage rates will be set and paid in accordance with the following conditions.&#13;
&#13;
      0    Inrelationto measurableproductiveoutput.&#13;
      0    M e n and women shouldreceive equal pay for work o f equal value.&#13;
      0    Wage rates will be set at the provincial level and will be based on prevailing wage rates&#13;
           for unskilled agricultural labor during the agricultural slack season-a         maximum&#13;
          national "cap" will also be agreed for the project.&#13;
      0    The preferred payment modality o f wages i s cash. Where food and cash resources are&#13;
           available, at least 50% o f the daily wages shall be paid in cash. Overall it shall be&#13;
           ensured that the total package (cash plus food) i s equivalent to the established&#13;
           minimumwage rate for the sub-project area.&#13;
      0   Wages shall be paid on time and in full. The preferred frequency o f payments i s bi-&#13;
           monthly.&#13;
&#13;
94.   NEEP projects should not be implemented (at a minimum they should be significantly&#13;
scaled down) where, or when, daily wage rates for unskilled labor are significantly higher than&#13;
the set daily wage.&#13;
&#13;
95.   Mixed, or complete, Food-For-Work schemes will be limited to areas with acute food&#13;
insecurity. The location and timing of construction activities under such schemes should reflect&#13;
the seasonal variation in food insecurity. In the identification o f projects, preference would be&#13;
given to those that can absorb large numbers o f targeted people, without inducing undesired&#13;
migration to the worksites.&#13;
&#13;
96.   The NEEPPMU,as part o f its donor and resources coordination activities, will ensure that&#13;
wage rates across sub-projects financed by various sponsoring agencies are kept consistent to&#13;
minimize distortions. A general consensus needs to be developed over the wage rate in workfare&#13;
programs inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Labor Productivity&#13;
&#13;
97.    To ensure that men and women receive equal pay for work o f equal value, payments need&#13;
to be linked to established labor-productivities. This will also improve transparency and increase&#13;
productivity. The advantage o f a remuneration system based on productivity, over one that i s&#13;
based on daily wage payment i s that it ensures cost predictability, minimizes supervision,&#13;
maximizes productivity and maximizes income and flexibility for workers. Pending the outcome&#13;
o f a planned labor productivity survey, the labor productivity norms as applied by the&#13;
Government/UNOPS will be the reference standard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure Development Issues&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
98.   As mentioned earlier in this Technical Annex, the project is an employment creation and&#13;
asset restoratiodmaintenance project. It i s not the right instrument to address broader, long-term,&#13;
sustainability issues in the sector o f rural access infrastructure. Within these limitations, the&#13;
project will endeavor to improve sustainability o f its interventions. Part o f the Technical&#13;
Assistance will include development and implementation o f a management information system&#13;
(MIS). A part o f this M I S could eventually be developed into a road network management and&#13;
maintenance planning tool.&#13;
&#13;
99.   The project will introduce other operational measures that may later become part o f a&#13;
sustainability strategy for the sector o f rural access infrastructure. Examples include storing&#13;
maintenance capacity by stockpiling and storing broken stones for use in post-project&#13;
maintenance or spot rehabilitation works, and other innovations inmaintenance methods.&#13;
&#13;
100. A number o f constraints hamper the development o f the country's rural infrastructure. The&#13;
Technical Assistance Component o f the project will support the government in implementing the&#13;
followingmeasures to address these constraints.&#13;

Project Scope&#13;
&#13;
 101. As discussed earlier inthis Technical Annex, the scope o f sub-projects (physical works) to&#13;
be implemented under this project (NEEPRA) i s limited to physical rural access infrastructure.&#13;
However, the NEEPRA i s also supporting, through the TA component, development o f&#13;
management capacity for the overall NEEP delivery mechanism. Other sectors included in the&#13;
NEEP include labor-based rehabilitation o f small and medium scale irrigation systems, labor-&#13;
based forestry, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project Performance Indicators&#13;
&#13;
102. These will be developed early on during project implementation and agreed with the&#13;
Government and its implementationpartners. The Project's performance will be monitored using&#13;
specific indicators such as: number o f unslulled labor-days o f employment created; kilometers o f&#13;
roads repaired; length of bridges, culverts and causeways repaired; and amount o f incremental&#13;
non-World Bank funds channeled through the NEEP. Key indicators initially agreed during&#13;
appraisal are presentedinAnnex 7. An outline o fproposed M&amp;Earrangements i s presentedinthe&#13;
section on Monitoringand Evaluation.&#13;

                   E. FINANCIALAND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
&#13;
103. Many destitute families needpaid employment as assets have depleted. Labor-based works&#13;
under this project are expected to provide employment opportunities (thereby high social returns&#13;
inthe short run)andbetter accessibility to remote districts (thereby economic progress inthe long&#13;
run).Since the project will create safety nets to reduce incomevulnerability, andwill rehabilitate&#13;
infrastructure, the Project has strong economic merit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
InfrastructureBenefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Roads&#13;
&#13;
 104.    While detailed cost benefit calculations have not been carried out as part o f this&#13;
emergency project preparation, international experience has shown that maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation o f rural roads and cross-drainage structures have a very high rate o f return. The&#13;
component for secondary rural access infrastructure (US$20.4m for MPW) will primarily focus&#13;
on removal o f key access bottlenecks. These will primarily be the repair and restoration o f&#13;
bridges, causeways, and culverts-all     with minimum 10 to 20 year initial service life-and          thus&#13;
will provide highlife-cycle returns despite the risk o flow routine maintenance inthe future.&#13;
&#13;
 105. Improved accessibility will help integrate the village economy with the regional and&#13;
national markets. It will also lead to better allocation o f resources, technology transfer and&#13;
realization o f higher productivity and outputs. It may also facilitate expansion o f rural non-farm&#13;
activities. Diversification o f household income sources will minimize the household vulnerability&#13;
risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
outputs&#13;
&#13;
106. It i s expected that 2,000 km of roads and 2,30014 m o f bridges (cross-drainage structures)&#13;
will be rehabilitated under thisproject.&#13;
&#13;
107. A specific priority will be to improve radial access between provincial and district centers,&#13;
and from district centers to main villages. The distance between villages can be as little as 5 km&#13;
or as much as 20 or more km, especially in mountainous areas. Some villages have only 20 or so&#13;
compound houses, or many more compounds, often in several sub-clusters. Only local roads&#13;
serving significant populations will be eligible for fundingunder the program. In some instances,&#13;
tracks may be upgraded; in others roads requiring rehabilitation after years o f neglected&#13;
maintenance-although      light traffic and drought have somewhat contained deterioration. District&#13;
roads built to 4 mwide plus shoulders should suffice where traffic i s light-lsewhere        7 mwidths&#13;
may be justified. Even though motorized traffic i s currently low, motorcycle and pickup traffic i s&#13;
expected to increase as soon as roads are passable, especially if water becomes more available&#13;
and agricultural productionincreases.&#13;
&#13;
108. Main district roads should also have good surface conditions for non-motorized transport,&#13;
such as carts, bicycles, and pedestrians. Sealing would be desirable; it may be required on slopes&#13;
or be justified to protect a fine granular surface topping. Given the harsh climate, the expected&#13;
low maintenance requirements, and the closeness o f Iran (from where asphalt products can be&#13;
supplied at low costs), surface sealing i s expected to cost much less than incountries further away&#13;
from supplies. However, sealing will also depend on funding availability, and the option will&#13;
have to be evaluated in each case, based on each road's individual merits. It i s estimated that&#13;
upgrading 1 km of gravel road, 4 m wide, would require some 4,000 unslulled labor-days, and&#13;
cost about US$12,000 equivalent, or more than US$20,000 ifa bitumen seal coat i s applied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l4Basedon estimates providedby MPW-see       Annex 13-at   an average cost of US$ 5,000irunning m&#13;
(average based onvarious degrees ofrehabilitation and reconstruction-as these vary from site to site).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
EmploymentBenefits&#13;
&#13;
 109. The needy and vulnerable districts will be selected through a consultative process. There is&#13;
little risk o f geographic mis-targeting, as most areas are in need. The wages to be offered are&#13;
expected to serve as a self-targeting instrument for the poorest. However, because job rationing&#13;
i s likely as a result o f the large number o f very poor people, institutional mechanisms are&#13;
proposed under the project to ensure that priority i s given to the most vulnerable. Options for&#13;
women to participate in the work-force will be promoted, such as production o f building&#13;
materials from the home or other socially acceptable locations. A review o f the wage level&#13;
switching point will be made as part o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
110. Assuming that labor costs represent on average 45 percent o f subproject costs, US$26.6m&#13;
in district sub-project grants would provide at least 6.0 million unskilled labor-days, plus&#13;
employment for Afghan engineers and other skilled workers. If there are 2 million rural&#13;
households in Afghanistan, and one person from each household i s eligible to work, excess up-&#13;
front demand for employment opportunities should be expected even as other programs operate.&#13;
The wage i s expected to vary from US$1.50 to US$2 equivalent per day, because o f regional&#13;
variations in the labor market. Limitingthe number o f labor-days o f individual households may&#13;
be necessary, as demand for employment opportunities i s likely to exceed the project's capacity.&#13;
Rationing and sequencing may thus be required.&#13;
&#13;
111. Looking into the future, after a decade o f equitable growth, labor-based public&#13;
infrastructure projects may be less justified than in the current circumstances. Better wages may&#13;
be forthcoming from agriculture or other private sector activities. But this i s not foreseen in the&#13;
short to medium term. For some years to come, excess demand for employment opportunities by&#13;
unskilled laborers is expected to persist. Project monitoring and evaluation will include a review&#13;
o f costs and benefits to define prospects o f future programs. Employment-based development that&#13;
leads to increased access will be a catalyst for economic and social progress.&#13;
&#13;
Risks andProject Alternatives&#13;
&#13;
112. The project builds on IDA experience inAfghanistan with different ministries and agencies&#13;
including MPW, MRRD, UN Agencies, and NGOs. Nevertheless, the project carries significant&#13;
risks o f misallocations or inefficient use o f funds given the dispersed nature o f activities and the&#13;
limited amount o f central government control over certain areas. Another risk i s that equipment in&#13;
support o f the labor may be unavailable within the short lead and implementation times dictated&#13;
by employment objectives. Despite the risks, the project design is preferredto other alternatives&#13;
given the importance o f the employment objectives. The other alternatives considered during&#13;
project design include:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)Apossiblealternativetolabor-basedworkscouldbewelfarepayments-cashtransfers&#13;
           without the infrastructure benefits. These have the advantages that all funds would go&#13;
           to needy families; that no energy would be spent on working on public schemes which&#13;
           necessitate more food intake; and that organizational requirements are lower under a&#13;
           subsidy distribution system. However, international experiences show that leakages&#13;
           related to targeting errors under welfare payments tend to be higher, resulting in high&#13;
           transfer costs. Further, welfare payments erode pride and lessen morale.&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)Foodforworkisnotanattractivealternativebecauseofagriculturedistortionsthatthe&#13;
           approach creates. Monetizing food aid would be preferable. Moreover, the logistic cost&#13;
           o f food aid tends to be high, more than that o f labor-intensive works on a cashpayment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            basis, and i s even higher when including the costs o f transporting food from remote&#13;
            international locations. Food aid would be justified in areas where crops have failed&#13;
            due to drought, are not in excess o f the amounts that normally would have been&#13;
            harvested, or to areas o f absolute food shortage where production prices would not be&#13;
            depressed by the aid.&#13;
&#13;
113. A summary o f other risks i s highlightedhere.&#13;
&#13;
114. The security situation could deteriorate (either throughout the country or in parts of the&#13;
country) - This i s outside the scope o f the project design. However, the project's modular design&#13;
will allow the project to cease activities inone or more unstable areas without stopping work in&#13;
areas where there are no or few security risks.&#13;
&#13;
115. Intervention by local warlords could divert funds from their intended uses - The project&#13;
design includes a series o f socialization workshops with Government inthe center, provinces, and&#13;
in the districts, and with local leaders and beneficiary representatives. A key message of these&#13;
workshops will be that the project includes a policy stipulating that failure to justify the use o f&#13;
funds ina transparent way will leadto the immediate withdrawal o fthe project from that area.&#13;
&#13;
116. Use of project funds in poppy cultivation - The project, by design will not attempt to&#13;
compete for employment provision in poppy cultivating areas. The project will also seek&#13;
assurance that participating communities do not engage in poppy cultivation. Project funding&#13;
would be terminated for districts and communities which do not comply with these arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
117. Corruption - For the sub-projects, corruption controls are expected to function through&#13;
public participation and transparency, by linkingdisbursements to outputs, and by utilizing UN&#13;
agencies as implementation consultants. Control over corruption for the labor-based works&#13;
schemes will be through engineers o f the implementation consultants and by independent&#13;
monitoring by consultants.&#13;
&#13;
118. The Government's ability to disburse project funds - Due to systemic issues and limited&#13;
capacity in the government institutions (line ministries, ministry o f finance, and D a Afghanistan&#13;
Bank), there have been delays in govemmental payments to contractors, consultants, and&#13;
suppliers. The Bank and the Government are agreeing actions to remedy the situation. Inthe case&#13;
o f this project, this risk will be mitigatedby making direct payments to implementingconsultants,&#13;
who in turn will use their existing systems for transferring funds to the provincial and district&#13;
levels, which to date have worked effectively.&#13;
&#13;
119. Capacity for accounting for and reporting on project funds - For the past one year,&#13;
reporting on the use o f project funds has been insufficient. IDA i s supporting a number o f&#13;
initiatives to improve project accounting and reporting to donors. However, for the proposed&#13;
project, as disbursements will be made directly to the UN Agencies, govemed by their contract&#13;
provisions and the requirements o f the Blanket Withdrawal application, reporting to the World&#13;
Bank and to the implementing agencies i s expected to be timely and appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
120. Project auditing - An existing IDA-financed project (the Emergency Public Administration&#13;
Project  - EPAP)     i s providing technical assistance to the Auditor General's office for auditing&#13;
project accounts according to acceptable audit standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ComplementaryPrograms&#13;
&#13;
 121. Other complementary projects under the Government's NEEP are: Employment Generation&#13;
Infrastructure Project (SIDA, EO); Labor Intensive Infrastructure Development (EC-CARE);&#13;
Community Based Irrigation (ADB-MRRD); and, Rebuilding Afghan Markets Program&#13;
(USAID).&#13;
&#13;
122. Various National Road Rehabilitation Projects are proposed for priority areas of the 3,000&#13;
kmpavedroadnetwork. Theprojects will bemore equipment-intensive.&#13;
&#13;
123. Various village development projects are being implemented by other agencies, including&#13;
food for work and opium eradication programs. Villagers who have obtained funds from these&#13;
programs will not have priority for employment underthis project.&#13;
&#13;
MonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
124. The NEEP JPMU will monitor the various subprojects, and physical outputs will be closely&#13;
compared to financial results. The Technical Assistance component of this project aims to&#13;
develop M&amp;Esystems for the overall Government's NEEP includingthe on-going IDA-financed&#13;
project and the proposed NEEPRA project.&#13;
&#13;
125. Sanctions are expected to be applied wherever monitors, supervisors, or other reviewers&#13;
find a lack of transparent information. Engineers involved in corruption will be fired and&#13;
subproject funding will be discontinued. The Project will also seek assurances that participating&#13;
communities do not engage in poppy cultivation. Project funding would be terminated for&#13;
communities which do not comply with these agreements. The people working on these&#13;
subprojects will be aware of these sanctions as they will be a part of the information campaign&#13;
that will precede the commencement of work.&#13;
&#13;
126. Under NEEPRA, an ex-post review of sample projects will be carried out 6-9 months after&#13;
sub-projects implementationhas started.&#13;
&#13;
127. Evaluation will be done by an independent organization mutually agreed between the&#13;
Government and the Bank during the project. Annual evaluations will provide data on outputs&#13;
and on processes, and will help inmaking design modifications wherever necessary.&#13;
&#13;
128. Quarterly financial monitoring reports will be produced showing: (i)    sources and uses o f&#13;
funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii)   physical progress; and (iii) of&#13;
                                                                                        status&#13;
procurement activities. These will be submitted to the Association within 45 days o f the end of&#13;
the quarter.&#13;
&#13;
129. A quarterly progress report will be prepared and submitted to IDA that consolidates&#13;
progress on activities, as further detailed in the Project's procurement plan and detailed&#13;
monitoring indicators. Responsibility for this reporting rests with the AACA, with MMRD and&#13;
MPW providing requisite inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                  F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
130. This project falls under an Environmental Category B (partial assessment). The principles&#13;
governing social and environmental management will be applied through an Environmental and&#13;
Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework) which i s attached inAnnex 14.The Framework i s&#13;
applicable to all activities financed by the proposed Project, and includes (i) policy principles&#13;
                                                                              key&#13;
for social and environmental management, (ii)      tools to guide the screening o f subprojects for&#13;
significant social and environmental impacts, and to assist in the mitigation o f such impacts, (iii)&#13;
procedures to ensure that these principles and tools are appropriately applied, and (iv) guidelines&#13;
and an action plan for capacity building and monitoring. The Framework will be operationalzed&#13;
through the proposed Project's arrangements for implementation, capacity building and&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
131. The relevant safeguards for this project are Environmental Assessment (OP4.01),&#13;
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20), and Cultural Property&#13;
(OPN11.03). Because individual subproject investments are not known in advance, the Project&#13;
will adopt a programmatic approach, with the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Environmental Impacts: N o significant environmental impacts are anticipated.&#13;
          Impacts are expected to be those associated with the rehabilitation o f rural roads and&#13;
          reconstruction o f very small infrastructure (i.e. culverts, stream crossings, retaining&#13;
          structures,   etc.).  Such impacts will be addressed by incorporating standard&#13;
          environmental operating procedures into the project manual, contract documents,&#13;
          technical training courses, and monitoring systems. Environmental Codes o f Practice&#13;
          (ECOPs)     will be developed to address environmental issues at the design,&#13;
          implementation and maintenance stages. Implementation consultants will be&#13;
          responsible for applying these ECOPs as well as carrying out preliminary&#13;
          environmental screening. Potential induced impacts in environmentally sensitive areas&#13;
          will be assessed and documented in the sub-project planning/appraisal format and&#13;
          mitigation measures designed and implemented, if applicable. Inparticular, the project&#13;
          should minimize the risk o f further depletion o f forest areas potentially resulting from&#13;
          improved access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Land Acquisition and Resettlement: The activities to be undertaken under the&#13;
          proposed Project involve rehabilitation o f existing secondary and tertiary roads and&#13;
          other related rural access infrastructure that are not likely to involve any land&#13;
          acquisition or have any other adverse social impacts. Even if additional LIPW&#13;
          activities, such as those proposed above involving rehabilitation o f irrigation systems,&#13;
          afforestation, and repair o f public buildings (schools, clinics, and administrative&#13;
         buildings) are included in the project, these activities would also not be likely to&#13;
          involve any land acquisition, resettlement, or have any other adverse social impacts&#13;
          (afforestation activities would require that existing resource utilization rights are&#13;
         understood and addressed). In terms o f the Environment and Social Safeguards&#13;
         Framework agreed between the Government and the Bank, the proposed project can be&#13;
         categorized as S-3, i.e., as not being expected to have any land acquisition,&#13;
         resettlement, or other adverse social impacts, but on the contrary having significant&#13;
         positive social impacts regarding improved livelihoods. The experience o f LIPW under&#13;
         the on-going ECEPWP has also been reviewed with regards to land acquisition, and it&#13;
         i s assessedthat the S-3 categorization i s applicable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           Inthe current socio-political context inthe rural areas, involuntary land acquisition is&#13;
           unlikely for the lund o f small-scale activities to be undertaken under the proposed&#13;
           project, since the costs in terms o f decreasing security deriving from local resistance&#13;
           would in all likelihood deter local authorities from attempting to acquire land against&#13;
           the will o f those affected. If minor pieces o f land are needed in connection with&#13;
           construction o f road structures, or minor changes in road alignments to eliminate&#13;
           hazards to traffic or to ensure year-round pass-ability, these would only be obtained if&#13;
           they are govemment lands free o f encroachments and other encumbrances, or through&#13;
           voluntary donation (local authorities do not have funds to purchase land). The sub-&#13;
           project planning/appraisal format in the Project's Technical Manual (or similar to the&#13;
           Project ImplementationManual for the UNOPS under ECEPWP) will include a check-&#13;
           list recording any amount o f land provided by the govemment or privately donated,&#13;
           ensuring that the land i s free o f squatters or other encumbrances, and in the case o f&#13;
           private land donations, providing written proof that it i s presented as a voluntary&#13;
           donation (see Attachment 2(ii) in Annex 14-the     Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
           Framework).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0    Minoritiesandvulnerablegroups&#13;
&#13;
           The project will not cause any adverse impacts on ethnic minority groups, and the&#13;
           overall project design which involves targeting o f vulnerable districts within each&#13;
           province will help ensure that different ethnic groups participate in the project and&#13;
          receive benefits from it. Within districts, inclusion o f different ethnic groups as&#13;
           beneficiaries in terms o f both income generation through labor contracts and improved&#13;
           connectivity will be addressed through the selection o f specific sub-projects, so that&#13;
           these include roads that serve villages inhabited by different ethnic groups. After the&#13;
           first year o f implementation, an assessment will be made o f whether this approach has&#13;
           succeeded in providing benefits to different groups in ethnically mixed districts.&#13;
          Results and recommendations from these studies and project monitoring in minority&#13;
           areas will be an agenda item in project annual reviews. Project monitoring will also&#13;
           assess whether within-village       minorities are being included among project&#13;
          beneficiaries.&#13;

Afghanistan-was     translated into local languages (Dari and Pushto) and disclosed inAfghanistan&#13;
and at the Bank's Public Information Center (PIC) in the Spring o f 2002. Thus, it was agreed that&#13;
the disclosure o f the original Framework meets the disclosure requirements o f this project. This&#13;
Framework has now been revised-without         changing the basic principles-to  meet the specific&#13;

                             PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       GENERAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
         The project development objective will be achieved by: a) the creation o f productive&#13;
emergency employment opportunities in maintenance and rehabilitation o f the roads&#13;
infrastructure, thereby also providing a social safety net for poor people in Afghanistan; b) using&#13;
appropriate labor-intensive methods in order to ensure high labor content o f the works to be&#13;
financed; and c) buildingcapacity o f government to implement the project and manage its overall&#13;
NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
         Given the above, the project will comprise two components:&#13;
&#13;
         Component A: Labor-based Rural Access Infrastructure&#13;
         Component B: Technical Assistance for Government's NEEP&#13;
&#13;
         The total allocation for component A will be US$34.2m, o f which US$13.8m will be a&#13;
    grant for tertiary rural access infrastructure, where each sub-project i s estimated to cost less&#13;
    than $200,000; and US$20.4m will be an IDA credit for secondary rural access infrastructure&#13;
    (cross drainage structures, i.e., bridges, culverts, etc.), where each sub-project i s estimated to&#13;
    cost inthe range US$500,000 - 1,000,000.&#13;
&#13;
         The total allocation for component B will be US$S.Om inthe formo f a grant.&#13;
&#13;
         In view of the dispersed nature of works to be executed in remote location in a&#13;
decentralized manner under component A, and given the post-conflict environment in the&#13;
country, the procurement risk i s considered high. Project supervision will include procurement&#13;
expertise in most missions over the life o f the Project. Threshold limits described below have&#13;
been set inaccordance with the nature o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       PROCUREMENTMETHODS&#13;
&#13;
         Procurement under the IDA Grant and Credit will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January&#13;
and August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and&#13;
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised in September&#13;
1997, January 1999, and M a y 2002). Procurement o f goods, works and services will follow IDA&#13;
approvedlstandard documents.&#13;

3.       IMPLEMENTINGAGENCIESAND THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT:&#13;
&#13;
         Two ministries will be involved in the implementation o f the Project: The Ministry o f&#13;
Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW).&#13;
However, due to lack o f capacity, the concerned ministries have proposed to hire UNagencies as&#13;
implementationconsultants for implementation o fthe Project components.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component A(1) will be implemented by the MRRD. For selecting the implementation&#13;
consultant for this component, MRRD will invite proposals from two or more UN Agencies&#13;
involved insuch operation services inAfghanistan, and select the Agency that can effectively and&#13;
rapidly scale up its operations in Afghanistan in order to ensure that sub-projects implementation&#13;
i s not delayed and employment benefits can reach poor in the shortest possible time. An&#13;
additional selection criteria will be the quality o f the UNAgency's team in terms o f its ability to&#13;
maximize the delivery o f employment benefits without compromising the qualityhstainability o f&#13;
the infrastructure repaired. Based on the assessment o f the appraisal mission, it i s most likely that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 UNOPS and International Organization for Migration (IOM) will be the two Agencies requested&#13;
 to submit proposals for this assignment. Like UNOPS, IOM also has wider coverage throughout&#13;
 Afghanistan in implementing rural access infrastructure sub-projects and i s maintaining a very&#13;
 strong relationship with MRRD.The reason for soliciting proposals only from the UNagencies i s&#13;
 that the Bank can make direct payments to the UNagency account. This will ensure, under the&#13;
 prevailing payment procedures o f the Borrower, that sub-project disbursements start immediately&#13;
 after the Project becomes effective.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-ComponentA.2 will be executedby the MPW with the assistance o f an implementation&#13;
 consultant. MPW has proposed for single-source selection o fUnited Nations Office for Project&#13;
 Services (UNOPS) basedon the followingjustifications: a) UNOPS are already operational and&#13;
 implementing sub-projects similar to this sub-component under ECEPWP LIWP for M P W and&#13;
have successfully established all required field procedures for needs identification, consultation,&#13;
 contracting, supervision, disbursement o f funds, and auditingknancial management, and for&#13;
coordination with MPW and other provincial and district entities which i s a significant&#13;
achievement inthe post conflict emergency reconstruction scenario; (b) UNOPS i s usinga&#13;
balanced mix o f local and international staff and partnering very well with local agencies' staff&#13;
duringsub-projects implementation which has helpedthem inperforminginthe field and in&#13;
gaining the trust o f the Borrower; and (c) UNOPS can ensure that sub-project disbursements start&#13;
immediately after the Project becomes effective, hence, ensuring that employment i s provided&#13;
almost immediately inthe areas proposedunder this project. This i s essential as this i s an&#13;
emergency employment program that aims to provide a social safety net to Afghans and raise the&#13;
acceptance o f the TIGA inall the provinces--a huge political payoff. According to MRRD,no&#13;
new implementation partner currently inAfghanistan or abroad can help achieve this objective in&#13;
the given time frame under this project.&#13;
&#13;
         MRRD shall sign an agreement with UNOPS only after receiving the Association's&#13;
clearance in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
          Sub-Component B will be executed by MRRDwith the assistance o f an implementation&#13;
consultant. Because o f LO'S expertise and experiences in providing similar services, and its&#13;
strong presence inAfghanistan, MRRDhas proposed to select EO, on single-source basis, as the&#13;
implementation partner for this component. Although the Component B consists procurement o f&#13;
goods, works and services, ILO will be primarily responsible for procurement o f services. For&#13;
procurement o f goods and works, ILO will sign an inter-agency memorandum of agreement with&#13;
UNOPS, who will carry out the procurement of goods and works under this component.&#13;
&#13;
         MRRDshall sign an agreement with ILOonly after receivingthe Association's clearance&#13;
inthisregard.&#13;
&#13;
4.       PROCUREMENT BYIMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANTS:&#13;
&#13;
         The United Nations Agencies, as the implementation consultants, may use their own&#13;
procurement documents. However, they will follow the procurement methods stipulated under&#13;
paragraph 2. IDA'Sprior and post review requirements, as mentioned under paragraph 6 below,&#13;
will be applicable to procurement carriedout by the implementation consultants.&#13;
&#13;
5.       PROCUREMENTPLANNING&#13;
&#13;
         Prior to implementation o f any community driven sub-projects, issuance o f any&#13;
invitations to bid for goods/works or initiating selection process o f any consultants services, the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                 37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement plan for goods, works and services shall be furnished by the responsible&#13;
implementation consultants to IDA for its review and approval, in accordance with the provisions&#13;
o f paragraph 1 o f Appendix 1 to IDA'SProcurement Guidelines. The procurement plan shall be&#13;
prepared following the Bank provided format.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.       PRIOR AND POSTREVIEW&#13;
&#13;
6.1.     Prior Review&#13;
&#13;
         The first three Level 1 sub-projects and the first three Level 2 sub-projects under&#13;
Component A.l, the first two sub-projects for secondary rural access infrastructure under&#13;
Component A.2; and sub-projects for works contracts above US$500,000 will be subject to&#13;
Bank's prior review.&#13;
&#13;
         Consulting services contracts estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 or more for individual consultants, and any selection o f consultants, including the&#13;
implementation consultants, on a Single-Source basis will be subject to IDA's prior review and&#13;
approval.&#13;
&#13;
        All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more&#13;

IDA's prior review.&#13;
&#13;
6.2.    Post Review&#13;
&#13;
        All other contracts, not governed by paragraph 6.1, will be subject to selective post-&#13;
review by IDA during supervision missions. The project provides for audits to be conducted by&#13;
independent auditors to be hired by the ministries for expenditures incurred as well as asset&#13;
verification. In addition, the project provides technical audits by independent consultants for&#13;
community construction works on a sample basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.      PROCUREMENTINFORMATION&#13;
&#13;
        The implementation consultants will submit quarterly Procurement Status Reports to the&#13;
concerned ministries and to the Bank within two weeks o f the next quarter in the format which&#13;
will be providedby the Bank. The Procurement Status Reports will indicate:&#13;
&#13;
            0   number o f contracts signed so far, contract amounts, contractor'shpplier'sl&#13;

   FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT,DISBURSEMENT,AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
         Since there i s no Country Profile o f Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country&#13;
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there i s inadequate documented&#13;
knowledge o f country issues and related strengths and weaknesses. However, IDA has gained&#13;
substantial experience in implementing three projects over the past one year. The overall&#13;
assessment i s that though the country's financial management system i s not fully functional,&#13;
appropriate mitigation measures, general and project specific, are being taken. General measures&#13;
include the engagement o f the Financial Management Agent and project specific measures&#13;
include the engagement o f the UN Agencies for assisting line ministries with project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
         The engagement o f the Financial Management Agent; the government's commitment to&#13;
transparent and accountable financial management, and the use o f UN agencies for assisting the&#13;
line ministries with project implementation and supervision, are the primary strengths o f the&#13;
project's financial management system.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
         The Project will follow standard government financial management policies and&#13;
procedures, including using the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent to record Project expenditures. In addition, the selected UN Agencies, will be required to&#13;
report to IDA on a quarterly basis according to formats to be incorporated in their contract&#13;
agreements with the line ministries. The use o f these procedures will allow for adequate recording&#13;
and reporting of Project expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
         Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the Ministry o f Finance, in particular,&#13;
the Grant Management Unit (GMU), with support from the Financial Management Agent, and&#13;
consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f Project&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
        The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f&#13;
the Audit Agent, with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project&#13;
financial statement to the Association would include a summary o f funds received (showing&#13;
funds received from all sources), and a summary o f expenditures shown under the main Project&#13;
components/ activities and by main categories o f expenditures. The format o f the annual Project&#13;
financial statements will be similar to the Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs). The audit o f the&#13;
Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f the accounting and&#13;
internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and&#13;
(c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association financing. The annual Project financial&#13;
statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, would be submitted&#13;
within 6 months o f the close o f fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f each year. The following&#13;
audit reports will be monitoredinthe Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Financing Percentage.       Since collection o f tax revenue has just begun and i s sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentages have been set at 100% with the understanding, however, that MOF will&#13;
submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. The tax structure o fthe government will be&#13;
reviewed periodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages&#13;
needto be set and financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Method.        Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with&#13;
fulldocumentation or against statements ofexpenditures as appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
Blanket Withdrawal Method: As project activities will be executed by UN Agencies (UNOPS,&#13;
ILO, and IOM), the Blanket Withdrawal application procedure can be followed, thereby enabling&#13;
direct disbursements to the UN Agencies. On this basis, the UN Agencies will be given an&#13;
advance, and thereafter, will report to IDA on a quarterly basis on the use o f funds and the&#13;
estimated forecast for the next six months, and seek direct disbursements. Although reporting will&#13;
be to IDA and disbursements will be made directly to the UNAgencies' bank accounts, the UN&#13;
Agencies will be requiredto keep the line ministriesinformed at all times on financial progress o f&#13;
the project. The use of Blanket Withdrawal procedure, however, does not preclude the line&#13;
ministries from disputing direct disbursement requests made by the UNAgencies to the IDA, at&#13;
any given time.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis o f SOEs for&#13;
all contracts for sub-grants under Component A(1), sub-grants for civil works less than&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent under Component A(2), goods less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent,&#13;
consultants' services for firms less than US$lOO,OOO, for individual consultant less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent, all training, audits and incremental operating costs. These SOE thresholds&#13;
are applicable for procurement made, ifany, outside o f the UN Agencies contracts. For all&#13;
contracts with UN Agencies, reimbursements thresholds and reporting requirements as to be&#13;
specified inthe specific contracts, will apply.&#13;
&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs means the incremental expenses incurred on account o f Project&#13;
implementation and management, including the installation, operation and maintenance o f&#13;
vehicles, computers and office equipment, communication and insurance costs, office&#13;
administration costs, Special Account banking charges, utility charges, domestic travel and per&#13;
diem, but excluding salaries o f the officials o f the Recipient's civil service.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account. Should there be a need for a Special Account at any given time duringthe life o f&#13;
the project, the MOF should write to IDA and make a request. The Special Account will opened&#13;
and maintained in D a Afghanistan Bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association;&#13;
and would be operated by MOF-GMUin accordance with the Association's operational policies.&#13;
The Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account would be set not to exceed US$1 million.&#13;
&#13;
Minimum application size.      Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) monthly, regardless o f amount, or (2) when the Special Account balance i s reduced&#13;
by 40%, whichever comes first. The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for&#13;
reimbursement, direct payment, or for applications for Special Commitments i s 20% o f the&#13;
Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe caseofBlanketwithdrawal applications, this minimumapplicationsize does not apply.&#13;
&#13;
Authority to withdraw Grant funds.         MOF-GMU will retain the right to sign and submit&#13;
withdrawal applications to the Association.&#13;

Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
        IDA has reviewedthe operating procedures, including financial management procedures,&#13;
o f UNOPS, and found them to be satisfactory. As regards other UNagencies to be selected, IDA&#13;
will needto review the operatingprocedures o fthese agencies, prior to making disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
        From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive supervision.&#13;
The focus during supervision will be on the internal control arrangements of the selected UN&#13;
Agencies for their internal functioning o f accounting, financial reporting and auditing. IDA will&#13;
review them inorder to ensure that they are incompliance with the operating guidelines reviewed&#13;
and accepted by IDA at the time o f the implementing agency's signing o f the contract with the&#13;
selected UNAgency.&#13;

                     THE NATIONALDEVELOPMENTFRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Developed and presented in April 2002 by the Afghanistan Interim Administration, the draft&#13;
National Development Framework provides the basis for the Government's reconstruction&#13;
planning, and prioritizesprograms for support.&#13;
&#13;
The NDF is based on three pillars:&#13;
0  Pillar One - Humanitarian Assistance and Human and Social Capital recognizing the&#13;
                                                                                -&#13;
   continuing humanitarian crisis and the need to address the pressingneeds o f the vulnerable,&#13;
   including the refugees, programs will focus on creating the conditions for people to live&#13;
   productive and secure lives through community development and developing social capital.&#13;
0  Pillar Two PhysicalReconstructionand Natural Resources - supporting reconstruction&#13;
                -&#13;
   activities to expand physical infrastructure and provide employment opportunities as well as&#13;
   laying the basis for a private sector-led strategy for growth.       Programs include urban&#13;
   development and attention to municipal development, roads, transport, water and sanitation.&#13;
0  Pillar Three - Private Sector Development - developing a competitive export-oriented&#13;
   economy, to provide an engine for growth and instrument o f social inclusion through the&#13;
   creation o f opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Under these three pillars, the Government has put forward Twelve National Programs being&#13;
prepared through a consultative process led by key ministries and involving relevant agencies and&#13;
donors.&#13;
&#13;
          Pillar One                       Pillar Two                       Pillar Three&#13;

   0   Cultural Heritage,                 Management&#13;
       Media and Sports&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition three important cross-cutting themes have been identifiedto be addressed within each&#13;
program:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0  Governance, financial management and administrative reform - efforts will include&#13;
   creating an enabling environment for cavity society development, ensuring equitable&#13;
   development by addressing provincial needs and those o f urban and rural areas, and&#13;
   developing systems for financial management and public administration that are transparent&#13;
   and efficient.&#13;
0  Human Rights, Security and Rule of Law - without security and peace it i s acknowledged&#13;
   that development efforts will have little chance o f taking hold.      A priority will be the&#13;
   development o f a national police force and army, re-absorption o f combatants through&#13;
   vocational training, and reviving the judicial system. This cross-cutting issue also recognizes&#13;
   the broader meaning o f security in removing barriers to inclusion and providing equal&#13;
   opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 e   Gender - this will have a two pronged approach     - first to restore the rights o f women and&#13;
     girls that were removed under the Taliban, particularly with regard to income eaming&#13;
     opportunities, and second, to undertake a process o f assessment across sectors - political,&#13;
     economic and social -to ascertain how to promote the inclusion o f women inthese sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Twelve NationalProgramsof Afghanistan'sNationalDevelopmentFramework&#13;
&#13;
The following provides a summary o fthe twelve national programs o f the Government's National&#13;
Program for Reconstruction.       Information has been obtained from Govemment documents&#13;
including the National DevelopmentFramework and the National Development Budget.&#13;
&#13;
Refugee Return: With an unprecedented number o f refugees retuming to Afghanistan and&#13;
settling in urban centers, facilities and services - already severely pressed to serve current&#13;
residents - are being stretched beyond capacity. This program aims to improve information,&#13;
registration and documentation o f refugees, and provide support to the neediest and their host&#13;
communities. Specific measures are being taken to cater to the needs o f the most vulnerable&#13;
duringthe cold winter months. The programwill also address policy and institutional issues and&#13;
develop the capacity o f government agencies aimed with assisting refugees and coordinating their&#13;
reintegration.&#13;
&#13;
Education: Given the appalling conditions o f the education system in the country, evidence o f&#13;
which i s population's education indicators-among     the worst in the world-and     the destruction&#13;
o f much o f the country's educational institutions, development o f an education system i s a vital&#13;
need for future growth and development in Afghanistan. The education program covers a range&#13;
o f essential areas including policy reform, improving education infrastructure, teacher&#13;
development, increased primary and secondary school enrolment with a particular focus on&#13;
female enrollment, as well as vocational training and early childhood development.&#13;
&#13;
Health and Nutrition: Suffering from highinfant, child and maternal mortality rates as well as&#13;
the prevalence o f communicable diseases and poor nutrition, the health situation for much o f&#13;
Afghanistan's population i s bad. This program will focus on decreasing mortality rates through&#13;
provision o f a basic package o f health services, and increasing the capacity o f government to&#13;
develop necessary systems and policies, as well as implementing a number o f specific&#13;
interventions including safe motherhood, and nutrition.        Issues o f civil service reform and&#13;
financial planning and management are also key priorities. The expected results are quantifiable&#13;
improvements in health indicators as well as improvements in health infrastructure and&#13;
institutional capacity within relevant agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Livelihoods and Social Protection: Aimed to address the risk and deprivation experienced by&#13;
large parts o f the rural Afghan population, this program will focus on five areas: institutional&#13;
strengthening, macroeconomic regeneration, community-based development, protection o f lives&#13;
and livelihoods and income generation. It is hoped that these activities will support sustainable&#13;
rural livelihoods and, through the National Solidarity Program and Emergency Public Works&#13;
Program, identified as a priority sub-program for immediate implementation, citizens and&#13;
communities will be empowered through directly designing and implementing reconstruction&#13;
efforts in their communities. This program will also address issues o f the disable who comprise&#13;
nearly 4 percent of the population.&#13;
&#13;
Cultural Heritage, Media and Sports: Recognized as a key element in consolidating a common&#13;
Afghan identity, particularly during the transitional period, this program will promote a number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of activities including the preservation o f Afghan cultural heritage, rehabilitation o f sports&#13;
infrastructure, and rehabilitation o f the media, with participation o f women encouraged in all&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
Transport and Telecommunications: The vital role o f good communication and transport&#13;
networks to economic development and national integration form the basis o f this program.&#13;
Suffering significant destruction and neglect through years o f war, large investments are planned&#13;
in these networks.      In addition to physical infrastructure, this program will also create a&#13;
regulatory environment to promote private sector participation inthe transport sector and address&#13;
policy and institutional issues. Inthe area o f communications, telephone, IT, intemet and postal&#13;
services will be addressed, as will the regulatory environment for private sector involvement and&#13;
the development o f technology for distance education inpriority areas.&#13;
&#13;
Urban Management:         With Afghanistan's urban population estimated at around 30 percent o f&#13;
the total population, this program aims to create cities as viable economic hubs around the&#13;
country. The program will address rebuilding in cities destroyed by war, provision o f services to&#13;
housing areas, waste water and sanitation services, new land acquisition for housing as well as&#13;
attention to policy issues such as town planning and management and standards, procedures and&#13;
legislation.&#13;
&#13;
Energy and Mining: As in other areas, the power and mining sectors have suffered severe&#13;
neglect after years o f war. The energy and miningprogram, which recognizes the significant role&#13;
of the private sector in this area, aims to secure cost-effective power supply to urban areas and&#13;
expansion to rural areas where it i s cost-effective and practical. The role o f government will&#13;
focus on regulation o f the sector and development o f a policy environment for private sector&#13;
participation rather than direct involvement inoperational activities.&#13;
&#13;
Natural Resource Management: Focusing on community management o f natural resources and&#13;
improvements in livelihoods, this program will rehabilitate and enhance the development o f&#13;
sustainable agriculture, horticulture and livestock production, including identification o f viable&#13;
substitutes for poppy production. Resource protection measures will include sustainable water&#13;
usage and protection o f existing forests as well as new planting through agro-forestry program.&#13;
Additionally, environmental laws and policies will be developed and awareness campaigns&#13;
conducted to reachout to the population.&#13;
&#13;
Trade and Private Investment: Private sector development lies at the heart o f the government's&#13;
development plans, and the trade and investment program will lay the basis for developing an&#13;
environment conducive to foreign and domestic investment. Activities will include assistance for&#13;
small business development, efforts to improve governance, creation o f laws in areas such as&#13;
competition, direct and foreign investment and standards and certification.       The challenging&#13;
issues o f divestiture and privatization o f state owned enterprises will also be included in this&#13;
program,&#13;
&#13;
Public Administration: The Public Administration program focuses on three key areas: the&#13;
establishment o f an effective civil service system; rehabilitating the physical infrastructure o f&#13;
government; and developing an organizational structure that permits the government to deliver&#13;
the needed goods and services to the Afghan public in an effective manner. In addition to&#13;
physical infrastructure, the program will aim to rationalize the number o f ministries, ensure that&#13;
donor assistance i s integrated into the budget process and reduce the number o f government&#13;
corporations. Within this program an important sub-program will focus on mainstreaming gender&#13;
inpublic administration.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Security and Rule of Law: Numerous specific activities relating to security are covered under&#13;
this program. To address the rule o f law, activities will improve the domestic justice system to&#13;
ensure independence o f the judiciary, and will include efforts to rebuild the administration o f&#13;
juvenile justice, prison and law enforcement systems. Among the activities to be carried out are&#13;
the establishment o f new courts and the strengthening of legal aid services within the&#13;
organizational structure of the Supreme Court.&#13;

&#13;
                       DEFINITION OF LABOR-BASEDTECHNOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         A construction technology which aims to apply a labodequipment mixthat gives priority&#13;
to labor, but supplements labor with appropriate equipment where necessary for reasons o f&#13;
quality or cost. While producing or maintaining infrastructure to a specified standard in a cost-&#13;
effective manner, people are employed with fair worlung conditions.&#13;
&#13;
         Ifapieceofinfrastructure istobe constructed or maintained, achoice canbemadeto use&#13;
either labor or equipment as the predominant input in the process. Any decision should be&#13;
objective and will depend on factors such as:&#13;
&#13;
         0    the type o f construction or maintenance;&#13;
&#13;
         0    the relative costs o f labor and equipment (true and un-subsidized) in the country or&#13;
              locality where the work i s to take place;&#13;
&#13;
         0    the availability o f labor and equipment;&#13;
&#13;
         0    the technical specifications for the completed works;&#13;
&#13;
         0    policy objectives or directives on technology choice.&#13;
&#13;
         It is important to distinguishbetweenan optimum and efficient use o flabor (labor-based)&#13;
and a maximum, and possibly inefficient, use o f labor (labor-intensive). However, a maximum&#13;
use o f labor may be preferred to efficiency where income generation and job creation are the&#13;
over-riding, short-term objectives    - forinstance disaster relief, or food-for-work projects.&#13;
&#13;
         The term labor-based on the other hand indicates that a flexible and optimum use i s made&#13;
o f labor as the predominantresource, accompanied by appropriate light equipment to ensure cost-&#13;
effective and quality aspects in construction. Labor-based technology therefore implies properly&#13;
planned use o f labor in an economically efficient, humanly fair, and hence sustainable manner. It&#13;
must produce technically sound results and be socially and economically competitive with&#13;
alternative equipment-based methods.&#13;
&#13;
         The use of labor-based methods also implies the increased use o f associated local&#13;
resources. These may include locally available materials, tools and equipment, skills and&#13;
knowledge as well as finance. For example if in certain countries the agricultural sector i s&#13;
flourishing, then it should be possible to tap into and use the tools and equipment produced&#13;
locally for agriculture, with perhaps some adaptation to make it suitable for use in labor-based&#13;
infrastructure provision. This reinforces the amount o f investment which remains in the country&#13;
and often inthe locality o f the works, and reduces the dependence on costly imports.&#13;

&#13;
           INTEGRATEDRURALACCESSIBILITY PLANNINGTECHNIQUES&#13;
&#13;
         The Oxford dictionary defines access as "the opportunity to reach, use or visit." In the&#13;
rural social and economic development context, the concept o f accessibility can be applied to the&#13;
access to basic needs like drinlung water, energy, employment and basic services like education,&#13;
health care and markets.&#13;
&#13;
         In the rural areas of many developing countries, travel and transport consume a large&#13;
portion o f the household budget in terms o f money, energy and time. Due to the generally poor&#13;
condition o f the road network, entire areas can become isolated for long periods o f the year. This&#13;
makes it difficult for rural households to access their basic needs. In this situation, paid&#13;
employment opportunities are virtually nonexistent. The result i s often that rural people are&#13;
forced to migrate to the urban centers. This further compounds social problems.&#13;
&#13;
         The IRAP process identifies prioritized investments that maximize the impact to those&#13;
most in need. This may involve the improvement o f the road network or the improvement o f the&#13;
distribution and location o f services. Providing the population with access to a range o f goods and&#13;
services and local employment creates the platform for economic and social development. This&#13;
can reverse the cycle o fpoverty and outward migration.&#13;
&#13;
         I"identifiesaccessneedsattwospatiallevels:&#13;
&#13;
             Within the settlement area: Destinations usually within walking distance for the&#13;
             majority o f the households, like potable water supplies, fuel wood sources,&#13;
             agricultural land and cultural and social facilities like primary schools and communal&#13;
             buildings.&#13;
&#13;
             Outside the settlement area: Destinations usually requiring the use o f a wide range&#13;
             o f public and private transport modes, like the market, secondary education facilities,&#13;
             health care facilities and administrative centers.&#13;
&#13;
         For every sector studied, the IRAP procedure first assesses the existing assets.&#13;
Information on travel time, travel cost and frequency i s then gathered. Villages are then ranked&#13;
according to their level o f ease, or difficulty, in gaining access to Basic MinimumNeeds (BMN)&#13;
and services. This serves to identify areas most in need o f development. Through consultation&#13;
with the stakeholders a prioritized investment framework is then developed. By comparing the&#13;
sector plans, an integrated accessibility plan i s then created. Using this multi-sector approach,&#13;
investments that conflict or are complementary can be taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
        The IRAP process develops around a series o f participatory workshops. The workshops&#13;
occur at both commune and district levels. The outcomes o f these workshops are processed and&#13;
the results are analyzed. Then stakeholders verify the analysis in follow up workshops. The&#13;
stakeholders taking part in the planning process are: village leaders, religious leaders, women&#13;
committee representatives, elderly people, Development Committees, local leaders, district&#13;
officials and representatives o f the departments o f health education, public works, rural&#13;
development, teachers, health workers and NGO representatives. The following steps are taken to&#13;
carry out the IRAPcycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 a)     Asset AssessmentandDataCollection&#13;
&#13;
        A situation analysis is made o f the district. It identifies access problems and target areas.&#13;
This process starts with an assessment o f the condition and the location o fthe rural roadnetwork&#13;
Transport Infrastructure Inventory (TII), other public infrastructure assets, Rural Infrastructure&#13;
Asset Inventory (RIAI) and the location o f all villages, commune centers and natural resources.&#13;
After the inventory i s completed, village level information i s collected on access, using secondary&#13;
sources and data supplied by key informants at commune workshops. Most o f the information i s&#13;
collected making use o f manual maps and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. This&#13;
serves as a basis to update the GIS maps.&#13;
&#13;
b)      AccessibilityAssessment,IndicatorBuildingandMapping&#13;
&#13;
        The data i s processed and analyzed for each settlement and accessibility indicators are&#13;
calculated at the village and the commune levels. The difficulty o f access to specific goods and&#13;
services i s quantified, in terms o f travel time, travel cost and fi-equency. Based on these&#13;
indicators, villages and communes are ranked according to their levels o f access to basic&#13;
minimum needs and services. Manual maps and GIS maps are produced to show the spatial&#13;
distribution o f the accessibility ranlung. Poor accessibility ranlungs can then be used to highlight&#13;
areas most in need o f development. The collected information is compiled into a document&#13;
referredto as the District Accessibility Profile (DAP).&#13;
&#13;
c)      IdentificationandPrioritization&#13;
&#13;
        The accessibility indicators for all o f the settlements are compared during a district&#13;
workshop using manual thematic maps. The stakeholders identify and prioritize areas and&#13;
locations, like transport routes, schools, health centers for possible interventions. A target village&#13;
or area with the poorest accessibility in a particular sector gets the highest priority for access&#13;
interventions inthat sector.&#13;
&#13;
d)      InvestmentPlanningof AppropriateInterventions&#13;
&#13;
        The stakeholders at the district and commune levels define the sector objectives for&#13;
access interventions. These interventions attempt to meet the BMN standards that the MRD uses&#13;
to monitor poverty. Using the BMNthresholds and other planning criteria, like buffer zones and&#13;
service areas, the sector priorities are compared with each other and integrated into an investment&#13;
framework. Maintenance o f existing assets i s considered first before identifyingrehabilitation and&#13;
new construction.&#13;
&#13;
e)      CostingandDesignof AppropriateInterventions&#13;
&#13;
        A more detaileddesign andcostingexercise is then carriedout to estimate the costs o fthe&#13;
proposed infi-astructure works. Standard unit rates are usedto estimate the costs.&#13;
&#13;
0       Submissionofthe AccessibilityActionPlan&#13;
&#13;
        Duringa final planning workshop the stakeholders study the investment framework and&#13;
the cost estimation and agree upon the final version o f the district plan. Then the Accessibility&#13;
Action Plan (AAP)i s prepared. It i s subsequently submitted to the Provincial Rural Development&#13;
Committee (PRDC) for integration into the provincial plan. Through the PRDC, it i s presentedto&#13;
government departments and development agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                  59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
g)      FacilitationofFundingandImplementation&#13;
&#13;
        The local authorities then make decisions about what interventions will be supported. The&#13;
design o f the interventions can then be finalized, tender documents prepared and individual&#13;
projects within the plan implemented.&#13;

Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The IRAP process enhances the integrated nature o f planning. It i s a simple and easily&#13;
applied participatory planning method. The resulting Accessibility Action Plan, although&#13;
primarily transport oriented can be expended to other sectors. The maintenance and upgrading of&#13;
existing assets are considered first in the investment planning, followed by the need for new&#13;
assets. IRAPi s participatory innature at every level and incorporates stakeholder perceptions into&#13;
the investment priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Where local planning processes produce village development and commune development&#13;
plans, IRAP has proved to facilitate the effective integrationo f these plans at district level, which&#13;
makes them complementary.&#13;
&#13;
   At the provincial level, the IWdistrict plans serve as the basis for the creation o faprovincial&#13;
infrastructure master plan. This provincialplan ranks the district sector prioritiesbased on relative&#13;
accessibility, the population served, socio-economic cost-benefit analysis and environmental and&#13;
geographic criteria.&#13;

&#13;
Rationalefor the PlanningandM&amp; EAdvisory input&#13;
The absence o f a rational process for project planning and selection, based on objectively&#13;
verifiable social and economic indicators, seriously affects the effectiveness o f investments made&#13;
ininfrastructure works. Another major problem is the lack ofeffective monitoring andevaluation&#13;
system. At present the Government i s not in a position to monitor the performance o f the&#13;
implementing partners and contractors and lacks information about the effects and impacts o f the&#13;
investments made in infrastructure works. To address these major constraints, the Transitional&#13;
Islamic Government o f Afghanistan has request the input o f a Planning and M &amp; E Advisor for&#13;
the JPMU.&#13;
&#13;
Initially an input o f 12 person months i s scheduled. Considering the complexities related to the&#13;
establishment o f effective planning and M &amp; E procedures and methodologies, and based on the&#13;
currently available slulls and resources inthese areas, the current lack o f effective methodologies,&#13;
data and systems, an extension o f the consultancy i s foreseen.&#13;
&#13;
GeneralDutiesandResponsibilitiesof the PlanningandM&amp; EAdvisor&#13;
The Planning and M &amp; E Advisor will be assigned to the NEEP JPMU and shall work under the&#13;
overall direction o f the Program Director o f the JPMU. The Advisor will report to the NEEP&#13;

other relevant programs. Together with his/her JPMU Government counterpart, the Advisor will&#13;
be responsible for the overall coordination and implementation o f activities related to the&#13;
development and implementation o f effective planning and M &amp; E methodologies and&#13;
procedures. Together with hisher JPMU Counterpart he/she will also be responsible for the&#13;
design and implementation o f a human resource development plan inthe field o fplanning and M&#13;

     Based on the review o f the existing planning and M &amp; E methodologies and the analysis o f&#13;
     data and data collection systems, develop effective planning and M &amp; E systems to cover the&#13;
     various stages o f the project planning and implementation cycle. Planning systems and M &amp;&#13;
     E systems have to be developed inline with the overall NEEP strategy and should take into&#13;
     account available personnel capacities. The Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP)&#13;
     procedure that has been developed by the ILO and that provento be a very effective model in&#13;
     various countries will be the basis for the development o f the planningmethodology.&#13;

Rationalefor the M I S Advisory input&#13;
A precondition for the effective implementation ofNEEPactivities inthe areas o fprogramming,&#13;
resource allocation, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, i s the establishment&#13;
and operation of a functional management information system (MIS). Although various donors&#13;
and implementing partners operate sub-databases, there i s not a single system in place that&#13;
provides the Government with comprehensive and accurate information that is required for NEEP&#13;
to execute its roles and functions efficiently and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
An input o f 12 person months is foreseen. However, the current level o f skills and resources&#13;
within the various organizations, and the present lack o f data and systems may necessitate an&#13;
extension o f the consultancy.&#13;

development and implementation o f a comprehensive MIS for NEEP in particular and for the&#13;
development o f a M I S master plan for the involved Government institutions in general. A&#13;
bottom-up approach will be used (developing one sub-system at a time) but at the same time top-&#13;
down issues (design of the overall MIS) have to be considered. In line with the capacity&#13;
development objective o f NEEP, the Advisor and hisker Counterpart will also be responsible for&#13;
the development o f a comprehensive human resource development plan and coordinate activities&#13;
formulated inthis plan.&#13;

Rationalefor the IrrigationEnvironmental EngineeringAdvisory input&#13;
The economic development objective o f NEEP is to provide increased livelihood opportunities&#13;
for the poor through increased access to public and productive infrastructure services, facilities&#13;
and assets. This should be achieved by developing and maintaining the country's rural and urban&#13;
physical infrastructure works through labor-based methods and technologies. At present a wide&#13;
array o f infrastructure works programs and projects are implemented but their effectiveness i s&#13;
seriously hampered due to a multitude o f constraints in the current planning, preparation,&#13;
contracting, implementation and supervision of these works. To address these constraints, the&#13;
Government has requestedthe input o f an Irrigation / Environmental Advisor to the NEEP JPMU.&#13;
Within the overall strategy that has been prepared for NEEP, specific issues related to the&#13;
development and maintenance o f the physical infrastructure need to be resolved and effective&#13;
labor-based methodologies, approaches and technologies need to be developed and implemented&#13;
to ensure an optimum return to the investments made invarious physical infrastructure sectors. In&#13;
the allocation of available resources, high priority will be given to the establishment and&#13;
implementation o f systems for the maintenance o f still maintainable infrastructure. During the&#13;
financial year 1382 a part o f the National Development Budget for NEEP will be allocated to the&#13;
irrigation sector and to environmentalprotection works related to NEEP's infrastructure activities&#13;
inthe roads- andirrigationsector&#13;
&#13;
Initially an input o f 12 person months i s scheduled. Considering the multitude o f current&#13;
constraints related to the development and implementation of appropriated labor-based&#13;
approaches, methodologies and technologies in the rehabilitation, (re-) construction and&#13;
maintenance o f physical infrastructure works, an extension o f the Advisory input is foreseen.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The strategy outline for the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) as presented in this&#13;
document reflects the outcome o f initial discussions between concerned Government institutions and an&#13;
appraisal o f identified key issues vis-a-vis the program's objectives. The strategy proposed inthis worlung&#13;
document does not represent the official view o f the Transitional Islamic Government o f Afghanistan.&#13;
The purpose o f this paper i s to facilitate further discussions between concerned Govemment institutions,&#13;
UNagencies, InternationalOrganisations, ImplementingPartnersandDonors inthe process ofdeveloping&#13;
an effective and comprehensive strategy for NEEP.&#13;
&#13;
Chapter one provides the background and rationale for the program. In Chapter two the contextual&#13;
framework o f NEEP in relation to the Government's National Development Framework i s described.&#13;
Chapter three outlines the core principles o f the proposed strategy. Chapter four presents the identified&#13;
strategic issues and gives an overview o f the proposed strategic interventions. InChapter five the specific&#13;
activities and inputs that are required to develop and implement the proposed strategic interventions are&#13;
presented. This chapter also includes a proposed timeframe for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Operational guidelines and directives related to the program management o f NEEP and the planning,&#13;
selection, implementation and monitoring o f specific infrastructure projects inthe various sectors covered&#13;
byNEEP, will be presentedina separate volume.&#13;

                                           Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
At the 2002 Tokyo Conference the Government of Afghanistan outlined its vision for a prosperous and&#13;
secure Afghanistan. Basedon this vision, the Government's priorities were articulated through 12National&#13;
Programs. As an interimmeasure, pending the finalization of the National Development Budget inMarch&#13;
2003, 6 national priority sub-programs were identified. These programs represent the nation's highest&#13;
priorities for donor fundingand needs were considered too urgentto allow implementationdelays.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
One o f the national priority sub-programs i s the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP). This&#13;
Program i s anchored within the National Development Plan for Livelihoods and Social Protection. The&#13;
purpose o f NEEP i s to develop replicable models and mechanisms to achieve its objectives; (i)   provide a&#13;
safety net for the most vulnerable people by creating productive employment opportunities; and (ii)&#13;
establish effective mechanisms for developing public and productive infrastructure assets, through based-&#13;
based methods andbasedon a private sector-led approach.&#13;
&#13;
Execution&#13;
&#13;
Funding, resource allocation and the implementation of projects under NEEP will follow Government&#13;
execution modalities. A Trust Fund will be established to ensure that funds are allocated in accordance&#13;
with principles and directions of the Government's policies and strategies related to social targeting,&#13;
sectoral priorities and geographical distribution. The Fund will provide donors with a focused and&#13;
transparent mechanism to contribute financial resources to specific sectors and program areas that reflect&#13;
Government priorities. Ifdonor funds are not channeled through the Fund, projects will only be prioritized&#13;
inthe NationalDevelopment Budgetifcompliance to Government execution is assured.&#13;
&#13;
The budget of the Trust Fundwill be gradually expanded over the coming years, in concurrence with the&#13;
Government's management capacity. During the initial year the Fund will be mainly used to correct&#13;
resource allocation unbalances that are the result o f the current lack o f transparency and coordination of&#13;
funds programming through donor channels. An oversight consultant will be assigned to assist the&#13;
Government in developing its Trust Fund management capacity. The oversight consultant will also&#13;
support the Government inexecuting its financial and technical control of the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
National Inter-Ministerial Board&#13;
An Inter-Ministerial National Board will be chaired by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development and represented by the relevant Ministers. The Board will be responsible for; (i)     providing&#13;
policy and strategy direction; (ii)  resource allocation and programming; (iii)     project approval against&#13;
agreed criteria and in line with National development priorities; (iv) establishing appropriate financial&#13;
modalities; (v) approval o f the oversight mechanism for effective resource management; and (vi)&#13;
supervision o fthe Joint Programmed Management Unit.&#13;
&#13;
Joint ProgramManagementUnit&#13;
&#13;
A Joint ProgramManagement Unitwill beresponsible for the daily managementofthe Program. The Unit&#13;
reports to the Inter-Ministerial Board. Designated representatives of the concerned Ministries, with&#13;
support from key partners, will jointly establish, develop and manage the Program. Main roles and&#13;
functions o f the Unit will be; (i)establish and maintain effective coordination systems; (ii)manage the&#13;
programmingh-esource allocation mechanisms; (iii) functional and appropriate methods, standards&#13;
                                                     develop&#13;

 and tools for programming, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) build capacity&#13;
 within the Government to implement NEEP; and (v) report to the Inter-Ministerial Board. Supporting&#13;
 partners will provide assistance based on their comparative strength. Qualified national and international&#13;
 agencies shall provide support in the areas o f social process management, community mobilization and&#13;
 capacity building. Other agencies and firms will have a leading role in providing technical assistance in&#13;
 engineering, contracting and financial management.&#13;
&#13;
 Main Issues&#13;
&#13;
 Social targeting: Various vulnerability assessments were conducted but uncertainty remains about their&#13;
 accuracy. The adaptation o f livelihood strategies in the present unsettled situation i s not reflected in the&#13;
 analysis nor i s coherent information available about actual preferences and needs o f the targeted&#13;
vulnerable groups. In this context it i s important to develop effective social targeting mechanisms that&#13;
relate to the principles o f equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work o f equal value.&#13;
K e y elements in developing such mechanisms relate to; (i)specific financial resource allocations&#13;
proportional to the targeted populations; (ii)transparent information campaigns and recruitment&#13;
procedures; (iii) the selection o f appropriate construction activities that maximize the participation o f the&#13;
targeted groups; and (iv) establishment o f appropriate wages rates and payment modalities.&#13;
&#13;
Coordination and Communication: A wide array o f coordination mechanism and management structures&#13;
exist but these are not firmly embedded within the Government structure. They are often donor-driven and&#13;
fragmented, and do not always have a transparent, output-oriented and time-bound, agenda. This&#13;
complicates the effective coordination by the Government at strategic and operational level and leads to&#13;
high costs and low effectiveness. NEEP's institutional set-up and the Trust Fund modality will be&#13;
instrumental inimproving the (cost-) effectiveness and efficiency o f coordination and communication.&#13;
&#13;
Information: Various projects and programs have their own data collection and information management&#13;
systems and methodologies. But there i s not a single system in place that provides the Government&#13;
decision-makers with key information that i s required for developing strategies, and for programming,&#13;
budgeting, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Available information i s scattered&#13;
throughout the international assistance community, i s not consolidated inone comprehensive database and&#13;
is not structurally accessible to the Government. The importance o f developing a comprehensive&#13;
management information system within the Government i s crucial. Without it, the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency o f coordination, programming and the utilization o fresources will remain limited.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Development: Over the last years the international assistance community has primarily focussed&#13;
on the direct implementation o f programs and projects. Providing assistance to the Government and the&#13;
private sector to buildtheir capacities, has received less priority. Capacity buildingi s a key element inthe&#13;
strategy. This relates to the development o f effective methodologies, the establishment o f effective&#13;
supporting systems and technical guidelines, and strengthening the human resource capacity through&#13;
training and skill development.&#13;
&#13;
Project Planning: Planning is a participatory and iterative process, simultaneously bottom-up and top-&#13;
down. At national level resourcing takes place and project planning, implementation and monitoring&#13;
guidelines are established. At local level coherent and transparent selection tools have to be applied. These&#13;
tools should include economic indicators. Sometimes it i s argued that participatory decision-making&#13;
processes can replace the economic selection process. But as the "wish-list" will typically be greater than&#13;
available resources, a rational process, using economic criteria, should be used to help priorities alternative&#13;
investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation: Based on the results of the planning process, activities will be undertaken that&#13;
best reflect NEEP's social objectives, implementation capacities, and the required functionality and (cost-)&#13;
effectiveness o f the works. A wide range of infrastructure construction works is captured under NEEP's&#13;
umbrella. These should all conform to the principles and guidelines that are being established by the&#13;
Program. But time i s requiredto provide a solid management capacity within NEEP. Given the current&#13;
time constraints and capacity limitations, the Program will initially focus on the development of planning&#13;
and implementation mechanisms in those sectors where a maximum effect, impact and visibility can be&#13;
achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting. Monitoring and Evaluation: It i s essential to establish a simple and effective reporting,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system within the Government. Implementing partners should follow this&#13;
system. This will enable the Government to monitor and evaluate the physical and financial progress of&#13;
projects and their effects and impacts. This information will be processed and analysed through a&#13;
computerized Management Information System. This will facilitate the process of decision-making within&#13;
the Government on the basis o f factual and comprehensive information.&#13;
&#13;
Norms and Standards: There i s a mosaic of norms, standards and procedures that are being applied by&#13;
different partners in planning and implementinginfrastructure works. These relate to wage rates, labor&#13;
productivity norms, design specifications, biddingand contracting, quality standards and monitoring. The&#13;
lack of uniformity and the frequently observed sub-standard project planning and implementation&#13;
adversely affect the return on the investments in the public- and productive infrastructure sector. Clarity&#13;
and agreementon standards and procedures i s essential.&#13;
&#13;
StrategyDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
Short-term Strategy: The short-term resource allocation strategy will be based on available information&#13;
and data, and on capacities for planning, design and implementation. Whereas NEEP will promote the&#13;
application of its principles and approaches throughout the various relevant infrastructure sectors, the&#13;
Program will initially target particular sectors in developing, testing, implementing and monitoring its&#13;
operational procedures. Inthis regard NEEP will primarily focus on public secondary and tertiary roads&#13;
and on selected large-scale irrigation projects during 1382. Associated soil conservation activities and&#13;
environmental protection works will be included as well. Routine maintenance activities will receive high&#13;
priority. Maintenance activities will be exclusively done through Cash For Work. No activities will be&#13;
selectedthat would have negative environmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
Long-term Strategy: The short-term strategy for NEEP will lay the foundation for the development o f a&#13;
long-term strategy that will be the focus on; (i)developing methodologies (targeting, programming,&#13;
planning, labor-based approaches, reporting, monitoring and evaluation); (ii)   developingresources(human&#13;
resources and skills, financial resources, equipment and transport, office facilities); and (iii)the&#13;
development o f management systems and procedures (operational manuals and guidelines, pilot projects,&#13;
reporting formats, monitoring and evaluation procedures, base-line studies and surveys)&#13;
&#13;
Time frame: Subject to the availability o f funds, staff and space, the Joint ProgramManagement Unit will&#13;
have a core establishment by the end o f May 2003. Mid-June 2003 guidelines for the planning and&#13;
implementation o f infrastructure works should be prepared for use by the Government authorities and&#13;
implementingpartners duringthe 1382 constructionseason. The implementation of the guidelines will be&#13;
closely monitored and evaluated. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, and the results of various&#13;
surveys that will be conducted, the long-term strategy will be developed.&#13;

1.       BACKGROUNDAND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
Two and a half decades o f armed conflict have devastated the livelihoods o f millions o f Afghan&#13;
people. The recent four years o f severe drought has further exacerbated the crisis. Available&#13;
information indicates that more than five to six million Afghan people don't have the means for&#13;
securing the minimumnecessities o f life. They have lost all or nearly all o f their stocks and assets&#13;
and have been stretched beyond their household coping and survival strategies.&#13;
&#13;
The response o f households in the context o f a war and a black market economy, confounded&#13;
with drought, resulted in multi-layered livelihood changes. Before the drought, households&#13;
diversified into low-risk activities aimed at maintaining assets and assuring food security in what&#13;
was a high-risk environment. The drought deepened these strategies, pushing many households&#13;
into depletion o f essential assets -land, livestock - and o f social and human capitals.&#13;
&#13;
Vulnerability interms o f food insecurity i s one dimension inthe context o f livelihood hazards in&#13;
the rural and urban economy but it i s also very important to understand that not all vulnerabilities&#13;
relate to food security. A major structural determinant o f vulnerability i s the inaccessibility to and&#13;
the destruction o f the productive, public and private infrastructure and assets inmany areas o f the&#13;
rural and urban economy.&#13;
&#13;
Caution i s necessary inorder not to confuse the apparent recovery in selected agricultural sectors&#13;
with the situation o f all rural livelihood systems. Improvements for some may have deepened the&#13;
vulnerability o f others, e.g. the drilling o f boreholes that may threaten the water sources o f more&#13;
vulnerable farmers or the access to potable drinking water for certain groups. Likewise, the&#13;
landless poor are not necessarily more vulnerable than farmers who mainly depend on their&#13;
livelihood from this agricultural land. The landless may have developed a more diversified&#13;
pattern o f on-farm and off-farm income sources than the farmer who mainly depends on his&#13;
agricultural production.&#13;
&#13;
With the understanding that livelihoods are dynamic and complex realities, it should be realized&#13;
that their composition cannot be assumed or taken for granted. The range o f vulnerabilities i s&#13;
vast, deep and potentially expanding and changing, and these concerns have to be addressed&#13;
systematically. In this context, building knowledge, developing sectoral and inter-sectoral&#13;
policies and strategies, strengthening government coordination and monitoring mechanisms, and&#13;
establishing functional management information systems within the Government are key&#13;
requirements. Inthis context it i s considered to be o f key importance that structural synergies are&#13;
established and maintainedbetween the various national programs.&#13;
&#13;
General consensus exists between the Government and the international partners about the&#13;
importance o f an employment-based safety net, through labor-based public works interventions.&#13;
This is reflectedinthe Government's National Investment Plan and inthe assistance providedby&#13;
the international humanitarian and assistance community. Duringthe last couple o f years various&#13;
labor-intensive Cash For Work (CFW) and Food For Work (FFW) infrastructure works projects&#13;
were implemented. It i s recognized that these interventions have achieved their purpose as a&#13;
safety net. But these programs were less effective from a developmental point o f view.&#13;
&#13;
There i s an increasing need to relate the safety net function o f these labor-intensive public works&#13;
programs to the development objectives o f the Government. Re-building and maintaining the&#13;
country's public infrastructure should be undertaken within a coherent functional framework that&#13;
enables the durable development and sustainable maintenance o fthe infrastructure assets.&#13;

2.       NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
2.1      The NationalDevelopmentFramework&#13;
&#13;
The Government's development priorities are reflected in the National Development Framework (NDF).&#13;
The development strategy i s basedon three pillars:&#13;
&#13;
         1. Humanitarian assistance and social policy to create conditions for the people to live secure&#13;
            and to lay the foundations for the formation of sustainable human capital.&#13;
         2. External assistance to build the infrastructure in the country and to develop its natural&#13;
            resources ina way that lays the basis for a private sector-led strategy o f sustainable growth.&#13;
         3. Development o f a competitive private sector, which becomes both the engine o f growth and&#13;
            the instrument o f social inclusion through the creation o f opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
The Government identified twelve National Programs to articulate its development priorities within the&#13;
NDF. Within the context o f these National Programs a series o f priority sub-programs, and specific&#13;
projects within these sub-programs, were identified and these are elaborated inthe National Development&#13;
Budget (NDB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2      TheNationalEmergencyEmploymentProgram&#13;
&#13;
One o f the Government's national priority sub-programs i s the National Emergency Employment Program&#13;
(NEEP). This sub-program i s anchored within the National Development Plan (NDP) for Livelihoods and&#13;
Social Protection (LSP), which i s embedded in the first pillar o f the NDF. NEEP i s among the&#13;
Government's highest priorities for donor funding as the needs to be addressed under NEEP are&#13;
considered o f vital importance. The Government's high priority to NEEP i s reflected in the SY 1382&#13;
National Development Budget. US$ 41.8 million has been resources for NEEP under the Budget for&#13;
Livelihoods and Social Protectionfor SY 1382&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
NEEP will be the Govemment's main instrument to link the establishment o f a viable and&#13;
effective safety net for the vulnerable and deprived, to the development and protection o f the&#13;
country's rural public and productive infrastructure. The long-term development objective, to&#13;
which NEEPwill contribute, i s formulated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    Development of the localproductive capacity in the perspective of longer-term&#13;
      economic growth, based on investment policies steered towards employment&#13;
  creation for the poor and the development of the country's physicalinfrastructure&#13;
                              through a private sector-led strategy.&#13;
&#13;
The contribution o f NEEP to the long-term development objective should thus not only be&#13;
perceived in relation to the provision o f short-term employment opportunities. Through NEEP&#13;
increased and improved access to local markets, schools, clinics and productive agricultural land&#13;
will be provided and natural resources will be protected and developed. This will have a&#13;
significant positive effect and impact on the social and economic well being o f the population.&#13;
&#13;
Within this overall development objective, NEEP's specific objectives are:&#13;
I. SocialProtectionobiective:Increasedsocialprotectionforanestimated5-6millionofthe&#13;
      most vulnerable people inAfghanistan through the provision o f employment opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
11. Economic Development objective: Increased economic livelihood opportunities for the&#13;
      poor through increased access to public and productive infrastructure services, facilities and&#13;
      assets.&#13;
&#13;
111. Capacitv Development obiective: Increased technical and management capacity in the&#13;
      government sector and the private sector with regards to resource allocation, planning,&#13;
      implementation and monitoring o f infrastructure works.&#13;
&#13;
NEEP will not able to address the entire spectrum o f livelihoods issues that needto be resolved.&#13;
With interventions limited to the development andmaintenance o f physical infrastructure, not all&#13;
the vulnerable groups can be directly reached through NEEP. Construction activities under NEEP&#13;
primarily require the input o f an able-bodied workforce and there may be less scope for the&#13;
disabled to participate in the mainstream o f these works. Other types o f programs and projects&#13;
may be more suitable to reach these groups (like small entrepreneur development, vocational and&#13;
skill development). A key element in NEEP's strategy however should be a focus on approaches&#13;
that specifically target the disabled and other particularly vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
3.       CORE PRINCIPLES OFTHE STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
The NEEP strategy i s based on a number o f general principles and principles related to&#13;
institutional sustainability, social targeting and infrastructure development. The general principles&#13;
apply to the various NEEP-specific principles.&#13;
&#13;
1. General principles&#13;

    4.6. Planning, prioritisation and selection based on rational processes, including economic&#13;
          criteria and usingobjectively verifiable information.&#13;
    4.7. Labor productivity as basis for costing infrastructure works and the payment o f laborers&#13;
    4.8. Infrastructure works' life-cycle costs to be considered, including maintenance costs&#13;
    4.9. Prioritisation o f still maintainable infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
All above principles should be considered in the strategy. Chapter four describes current issues&#13;
relatedto these principles outlines strategies to address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.    STRATEGIC ISSUES AND APPROACHES&#13;
&#13;
4.1      InstitutionalIssues&#13;
&#13;
There i s insufficient      Government ownership in coordinating, directing and executing&#13;
development activities. Existing coordination mechanisms exist among the international&#13;
assistance community but these are not very transparent and do not always have an output-&#13;
oriented and time-bound agenda. The coordination structures are fragmented and are not&#13;
consideredto be very effective and efficient interms o f institutional sustainability. There i s a lack&#13;
o f accountability, coherence, cost-effectiveness and quality in programming, planning and&#13;
implementingdevelopment programs and projects.&#13;
&#13;
The current system o f donor-channelled resource allocation for infrastructure investments lacks&#13;
transparency and i s not very efficient or effective in ensuring a balanced programming and funds&#13;
allocation. There i s also insufficient compliance by donors to Government executingmodalities.&#13;
&#13;
Due to the absence of effective information and reporting systems inthe Government, the quality&#13;
o f decision making at strategic level i s negatively affected. This leads to a sub-optimum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   89&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 allocation o f available resources. At operational level there i s a lack o f quality and uniformity in&#13;
 standards, guidelines and procedures. This leads to a low cost-effectiveness o f the investments in&#13;
infrastructure works, a reduced lifetime and increased maintenance costs. Problems are further&#13;
aggravated because o f the limited capacity within the Government. As institutional capacity&#13;
buildingwithin the Government is a prerequisite for sustainable development, it is required that&#13;
more assistance is provided by the international donor community for capacity building.Figure 2&#13;
presents a flow chart indicating the relation between the four core institutional issues and the&#13;
various steps inthe NEEP cycle.&#13;

&#13;
To provide an effective framework for coordination and decision-malung, an Inter-ministerial&#13;
Board will be established. A Joint Program Management Unit will be responsible for the day-to-&#13;
day management o f NEEP. External support will be provided by qualified agencies and&#13;
organisations. At Provincial level Government-led Technical Support Units will coordinate and&#13;
supervise the implementation of the infrastructure works. Figure 3 presents the proposed&#13;
institutional framework for NEEP.&#13;

4.2.2    ExecutingModalitiesandFundingMechanism&#13;
&#13;
In executing projects within the NEEP structure, the Implementing Partners will follow the&#13;
Government's principles regardingthe execution o f the National DevelopmentBudget. Two main&#13;
principles apply:&#13;
&#13;
1, All funds are channelledthrough the NationalDevelopmentBudget (NDB);&#13;
2. If donors don't course funds through NDB, they will accept the Government's executing&#13;
     authority&#13;
&#13;
Projects inthe National Development Budget will be prioritised according to adherence to above&#13;
principles. Where neither principle i s agreed, the project will not be prioritised.&#13;
&#13;
The Government will establish a Trust Fundto ensure that funds are allocated and distributed in&#13;
accordance with the principles and directions provided inthe strategy. Funds channelled through&#13;
the Government or directly sourced by donors to NGOs or other non-Government implementing&#13;
partners, should be used efficiently and effectively. Intermediate sub-contracting layers should be&#13;
avoided. The already operational Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF) will be used as&#13;
the Trust Fund for NEEP. A transparent system o f multi-year planning and budgeting will be&#13;
applied, linkmgphysical planningto financial resource allocation.&#13;
&#13;
Through NEEP and its Trust Fundmechanism, the Government will gain control inprogramming&#13;
and allocating funds for infrastructure development. The Government National Development&#13;
Budget for NEEP reflects the intention to gradually increase its control over this process. During&#13;
SY1382 the proposedbudget is relatively small to allow the NEEP structure to be established and&#13;
to develop.&#13;
&#13;
Duringthis first year, programmingand fundallocationthrough NEEP's structure will enable the&#13;
Government to allocate sufficient funds to prioritisedvulnerable groups and to sectors. Itwill also&#13;
give the Government an instrument to correct unbalances in fund allocations caused by the&#13;
currently fragmented way in which donors and implementing partners operate. Gradually, the&#13;
Government will expand the budget o f the Trust Fundand NEEP will become more the steering&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
The Trust Fundwill eventually be comprised o f a general fund and sectoral sub-funds.This will&#13;
enable donors, who target resources sectorally, to fund directly and have specific sets o f criteria&#13;
for allocation and disbursement. In case o f national emergencies (like earthquakes) or shifting&#13;
Government priorities, NEEP's National Board will review potential re-allocations between the&#13;
sectoral sub-funds.&#13;
&#13;
Apart from the general fund and the sectoral sub-funds, the Trust Fundwill also include a limited&#13;
Quick Response Fund (QRF). This QRF will be used to meet funding requirements o f high&#13;
priority projects that require a quick response and cannot be accommodated within the framework&#13;
o f the NEEP regular planning and implementation cycle. During 1382 the Trust Fund will be&#13;
mainly a general fund to enable the Government to direct resources in geographical areas or&#13;
sectors that are relatively under-resourced. A schematic presentation o f the Trust Fund set-up i s&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4.2.3   CapacityBuilding&#13;
&#13;
To enable an efficient, transparent and effective management and coordination o f NEEP,&#13;
sufficient resources will have to be allocated for capacity building activities. Capacity building&#13;
will focus on strengthening and developing methodologies, supporting systems andresources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A. Methodologies: Effective and uniformmethodologies will be developed for:&#13;

4.3       SocialTargeting Issues&#13;
&#13;
Although various vulnerability assessments were conducted, much uncertainty remains about&#13;
their quality and accuracy. In addition, these assessments predominantly focussed on the food&#13;
security aspects of vulnerability. The adaptation of livelihood strategies in the present unsettled&#13;
situation i s also not reflected in the vulnerability analysis nor i s coherent information available&#13;
about actual needs and preferences of the targeted vulnerable groups. The lack of accurate and&#13;
complete information and the absence of an effective targeting strategy are serious constraints to&#13;
the effectiveness ofthe present social protectioninterventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.4      SocialTargeting Strategy&#13;
&#13;
4.4.1    Vulnerability Assessment&#13;
&#13;
A precondition for an effective social targeting strategy is a comprehensive database that will&#13;
provide information requiredfor the development of effective social targeting methodologies and&#13;
approaches. Within the framework of the recently established National Livelihoods and Social&#13;
Protection Surveillance System, comprehensive vulnerability assessments will be undertaken on a&#13;
yearly basis. Through these assessments, key indicators o f vulnerability will be collected. Those&#13;
include quantitative indicators of accessibility to infrastructure facilities, services and assets. This&#13;
information, in combination with data on the geographical distribution of the population in&#13;
general and the targeted vulnerable groups inparticular, will form the basis for the programming&#13;
and resource allocation.&#13;
&#13;
4.4.2    Resource Allocation&#13;
&#13;
To ensure an equitable distribution of NEEP's available resources among the targeted&#13;
beneficiaries, specific resource allocating formulae will be used. Inthe absence of comprehensive&#13;
and consolidated vulnerability indicators at Provincial and District level, resource allocations will&#13;
initially be based on total Provincial population figures. A distinction i s made between rural and&#13;
urban areas. For fund allocations to rural areas the followingprocedure will be applicable:&#13;
&#13;
         Collect, validate and consolidate available information on the size of the ruralpopulation&#13;
         per Provinceand calculate the proportionofthe Provincial population(P,) as a fraction of&#13;
         the total population (PJ;&#13;
         Collect, validate and consolidate quantitative information at Provincial level about&#13;
         current and committed wage resource allocations (inUS$) that are not covered under the&#13;
         NEEP budget for the different physical infrastructure sectors. Calculate the wage&#13;
         resource allocations per Province (W,) and summarize the wage resource allocations of&#13;
         all the Provinces (Wp-total);&#13;
         Add the NEEP national rural budget for wages        (WNEEp)   to W,+,,~.  This gives the total&#13;
         national available budget for wages in rural labor-based physical infrastructure&#13;
         development works;&#13;
         Calculate the Provincial NEEP Budget (NEEPprovincia1),applying the following formulae:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Subject to the available o f data, the same procedure can subsequently be applied for resource&#13;
allocation within the Districts of a Province. The resource allocation procedures can be further&#13;
refined once comprehensive and quantitative information will be available at Provincial and&#13;
District level on vulnerability indicators and needs assessments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  96&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
To ensure an appropriate balance between NEEP's social objective and its infrastructure&#13;
development objective, it i s envisaged that at least 60% of NEEP's investment resources per&#13;
Province should be allocated for the payment of wages. NEEP pilot projects with a particular&#13;
purpose may be exempted from this overall directive.&#13;
&#13;
Inurbanareas arelatively limitedNEEPwill beimplemented. During1381approximately twenty&#13;
million labor-days of work were generated through labor-intensive public works programs, of&#13;
which 10%was generatedthrough urban-basedprograms. For 1382 also about 10% of the NEEP&#13;
National Development Budget will be allocated for urban public infrastructure development&#13;
works. This will benefit an estimated 70,000 urban families through the provision o f employment.&#13;
Resource allocation procedureswill be similar to those for rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
4.4.3    EqualOpportunityandAccess to Jobs&#13;
&#13;
Core principles in developing effective social targeting mechanisms all relate to the principles of&#13;
equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work of equal value. There should be no&#13;
discrimination against persons in their employment on the basis of their race, colour, sex,&#13;
religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, or on any other basis set out in&#13;
national legislation.     These principles are related to human rights and are laid down in&#13;
international labor conventions, many o f which have been ratified by the Government o f&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
These principles have to be translated in guidelines that especially target the most vulnerable&#13;
people. These include the disabled and handicapped, returnees, IDPs, pastoralists, female-headed&#13;
households, the elderly and destitute women. For these vulnerable groups there are generally less&#13;
opportunities to participate in physically demanding infrastructure works. Women are also often&#13;
excluded fiom public labor-based projects because of religious and traditional noms and values.&#13;
To promote the participation of these groups in NEEP projects, the following measures are&#13;
proposed:&#13;
&#13;
1. Specific national-level resource allocations o f NEEP's budget for wages to vulnerable&#13;
    groups. The proposed allocations reflect currently available data on the composition of the&#13;
    most vulnerable groups:&#13;
&#13;
         5-10%to vulnerable disabled men and women who can participate inthe works&#13;
    ...&#13;
    ..&#13;
    .    5% to vulnerable disabled menandwomen who cannot participate inthe worksI6&#13;
         5% to vulnerable pastoralists&#13;
         5% to vulnerable returnees&#13;
         5-10% to destitute women and other vulnerable female-headedhouseholds&#13;
         65-75% to vulnerable able-bodied menand women, including ex-combatants.&#13;
&#13;
2. Promoting the employment o f women and the disabled by carefully exploring the scope for&#13;
    incorporating activities where these groups can participate. Should women wish to participate&#13;
    in construction activities, up to 50% of the funds for wages will be allocated for female&#13;
    workers. Some examples o f activities where women and certain groups o f disabled can&#13;
    participate, are:&#13;
    .... Routinemaintenance of tertiary and secondary roads;&#13;
         Preparing dressed stones for road pavingwithin a confined compound inthe village&#13;
         Weaving gabion mattresses for gabion boxes within a confined compound inthe village&#13;
         Supervision o f the labor gangs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l6For infrastructure works that facilitate access for the disabled to facilities and services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       97&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     ..&#13;
     .   Assisting Government staff with surveys and measurements&#13;
         Keeping attendance registers and muster rolls o fthe labor-force&#13;
     .   Storekeeping for construction materials and tools&#13;
         Managing tree nurseries that supply seedlings for forestation or soil conservation&#13;
         activities&#13;
         Plantationand care-taking o f seedlings&#13;
&#13;
3. The introduction o f a task work system and a piecework system. A task i s a defined output&#13;
    over a certain period o f time for a certain activity (e.g. cleaning the side ditches along a&#13;
    defined section o f a road within a period o f seven days). A piece i s a defined unit o f output&#13;
    (e.g. one dressed stone with defined specifications). Under the task work system and the&#13;
    piecework system, wage payments will be related to the labor productivity (or output). This&#13;
    system will provide flexibility in workmg hours, as payments are not based on fixed working&#13;
    hours but on the achieved output.&#13;
&#13;
4. Equal opportunity to access to jobs can only be achieved if the targeted population is well&#13;
    informed about the possibilities and conditions o f employment. This requires a properly&#13;
    designed and implementedinformation &amp; communicationcampaign.&#13;
&#13;
5. Recruitment procedures should be very transparent and should reflect the principle of equal&#13;
    opportunities inaccess. Ifthere are morejob seekers thanjobs, a monthlyjob rotation will be&#13;
    applied through a lottery system. To ensure equality of opportunity at the family level, only&#13;
    one able-bodied person per family will be eligible for employment at a time.&#13;
&#13;
4.4.4    Timing, Scale andLocationof Activities&#13;
&#13;
Proper timing and scaling o f activities are very important considerations inrelation to the social&#13;
targeting objective o f NEEP. The Program should not compete with other demands for casual&#13;
labor. Especially during the agricultural peak season implementation agencies and their partners&#13;
have to assess carefully the local situation o f labor supply vis-&amp;vis requirements. If necessary,&#13;
operations should be scaled downs during this period or even be suspended (except maintenance&#13;
activities).&#13;
&#13;
Works are to be located in the vicinity o f the areas where the targeted population lives. The&#13;
purpose o f the Program i s not to increase the suffering o f the already vulnerable population by&#13;
locating activities far away from their homes. Experiences indicate that works should be located&#13;
within a radius o f 5-8 kilometres from the targeted community. To avoid inequity in resource&#13;
allocation and possible undesirable effects o f differences in approaches, projects under NEEP's&#13;
National Development Budget will be initially targeted to those areas that are not served yet by&#13;
other major relevant programs like NSP and NABDP.&#13;
&#13;
4.4.5    Wage Ratesand Payments&#13;
&#13;
Wage rates and payment modalities constitute important social targeting instruments. Ifthe wage&#13;
rates are set to high, the social targeting objective will not be achieved. Ifthe rates are set too low,&#13;
productivities will decrease and the Program will be perceived as a welfare program rather than&#13;
an infrastructure program. The convention on the protection o f wages stipulates that wages should&#13;
be paid in cash money. Where wages are paid partially in the form o f allowances in kind, they&#13;
should be appropriate for the personal use and benefit o f the worker and his or her family, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   98&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 fair value should be attributed to such allowance^'^. Wage rates will be set andpaidinaccordance&#13;
 with the following conditions:&#13;
&#13;
 1. Men and women should receive equal pay for work of equal value.&#13;
 2. Currently available information suggests that the minimum daily wage for unsllled casual&#13;
     labor should not be below US2.0, or the equivalent inanother currency or inkind.&#13;
 3.  Wage rates will be set at Provincial level and will be based on prevailing wage rates for&#13;
     unskilledagricultural labor duringthe agriculturalslack season.&#13;
 4. The preferred payment modality of wages i s cash. Where food and cash resources are&#13;
     available, at least 50% of the daily wages shall be paid in cash. The food portion of a daily&#13;
     wage shall not exceed four kilogramof wheat per worker.&#13;
 5.  Wages shall be paid on time and infull. The preferred frequency o fpayments i s monthly.&#13;
&#13;
Projects within the framework of NEEP should not be implemented or significantly be scaled&#13;
down in those areas and/or duringthose periods in the year where or when daily wage rates for&#13;
unskilledlabor are significantly higherthan the set daily wage.&#13;
&#13;
Mixed FFWICFW schemes or FFW schemes will be limitedto areas with acute or very highfood&#13;
insecurity, to be agreed upon between the Government and WFP. The location and the timing of&#13;
constructionactivities under such schemes should reflect the seasonalvariation infood insecurity.&#13;
In the identification of these projects preference will be given to those that can absorb large&#13;
numbers of targeted people, without inducing undesired migration to the worksites. FFW&#13;
payment modalities will not be applied inmaintenance schemes. Maintenance works will be fully&#13;
carried out through CFW activities. FFW schemes will only be approved if all the funding&#13;
resourcesare securedto complete that scheme ina functional way.&#13;
&#13;
4.4.6    Labor Productivity&#13;
&#13;
To ensure that men and women receive equal pay for work of equal value, it i s very important&#13;
that payments are linked to established and appropriate labor-productivities. This will also&#13;
improve transparency and increase productivity. The advantage o f a remuneration system based&#13;
on productivity over daily wage payment i s that it ensures cost predictability, minimizes&#13;
supervision, maximizes productivity and maximizes income and flexibility for workers. Pending&#13;
the outcome of a planned labor productivity survey, the labor productivity norms as applied by&#13;
the GovernmentAJNOPS will be the reference standard. An exception will be the payment system&#13;
for the disabled workers where wages will be fixed on a daily basis. Generally, the work to be&#13;
done by these workers i s of a different nature than the work done by the able-bodied workers and&#13;
it will be often impossibleto set daily, productivity-related,tasks for these workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l7In 1963 a principle agreement was reached between the ILO andWFP that, inthe case o fWFP projects&#13;
involving the employment of wage labor, the workers should receive, in addition to the food supplied, a&#13;
cash payment of not less than 50% o f the wage prevailing in the locality for the kind o f work to be done.&#13;
This requirement was intended to ensure that workers would be able to meet essential non-food needs, and&#13;
would not be led to sell or barter the WFP food received.&#13;

5.       OUTPUTS,ACTIVITIESAND STAFFINGINPUTS&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 presents the framework relationships between: a) NEEP's specific objectives as&#13;
mentioned in paragraph 1.2.1; b) the expected outputs at the end o f SY 1382; and c) the main&#13;
activities that are requiredto achieve these outputs.&#13;
&#13;
Indicated outputs reflect the resourced budget under the NEEP National Development Budget o f&#13;
the National Investment Plan (see figure 1) and the food resources available through WFP's&#13;
Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (approximate value o f these food resources: US$49&#13;
million).&#13;
&#13;
The substantial additional outputs with regards to the creation o f employment opportunities and&#13;
the development o f infrastructure covered under other National Development Budgets and&#13;
fundingchannels are not incorporated inthe table 1.&#13;
&#13;
For the development o f the methodologies, support systems and resources, available Government&#13;
inputs will need to be mobilized. Considerable external support will be required as well to&#13;
strengthen the Government's capacity in the management o f NEEP. Table 2 outlines the&#13;
envisaged minimumkey full-time personnel inputrequirements for the JPMU during SY 1382.&#13;
&#13;
Apart from these minimum staffing input requirements, a representation o f the participating&#13;
Ministries in the JPMU will be needed to ensure adequate communication, coordination and&#13;
dissemination o f information. Support staff will be required for the day-to-day management o f the&#13;
office.&#13;
&#13;
Additional short-term external support will be required for the development o f a number o f&#13;
methodologies and for strengthening the database by conducting a number o f base-line studies&#13;
and surveys.&#13;
&#13;
To enable the implementation o f NEEP duringthe SY 1382 construction season it will be critical&#13;
that the following activities are completed by the end o fApril 2003:&#13;
&#13;
    Establishthe Inter-Ministerial Board and the Joint ProgramManagementUnit.&#13;
    Secure the operational budget for the Joint Program Management Unit&#13;
    Recruitment and secondment o f staff to the Joint ProgramManagementUnit&#13;
    Procurement o f equipment and transport for the Joint Program Management&#13;
    Finalize the draft short-term strategy through a consultative process (including workshops)&#13;
    withthe Government stakeholders, implementingpartners, UNagencies and donors.&#13;
    Consolidate available data and information required for the programming o f resources.&#13;
    Develop operational guidelines and procedures.&#13;

&#13;
        WAGE RATESAND PARTICIPATION OFWOMEN AND DISABLED&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wage Rates&#13;
&#13;
      Wage rate i s critical decision variable in NEEP and it should serve as an instrument for&#13;
      self targeting. Besides providing livelihood security, it should help generate productive&#13;
      and durable infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
      L o w wage rates facilitate self selection and minimizes the need for rationing. But very&#13;
      low wage rates affect quality o f assets and NEEP works are primarily post-conflict&#13;
      reconstruction works.&#13;
&#13;
      Highwage rates leadto excess demand andthis leads to rationing; which in-tumbecomes&#13;
      problematic as un-fair practices creep-in once rationingbecomes a norm.&#13;
&#13;
      Highwage rates are likely to exclude the most needy and maximizes bothinclusion and&#13;
      exclusion errors. The vulnerable groups' share in wage bill will be lowered on account&#13;
      o f fall innumber o f days o f employment for a given budget. It may disrupt the existing&#13;
      labor market and may adversely effect the other economic activities. It may even result&#13;
      in a high cost economy and make the domestic products non-competitive. Highwage&#13;
      rates may induce adoptiono f capital intensive technologies displacing labor.&#13;
&#13;
      The market wage for unskilled workers inlean season ina province be the upper limit for&#13;
      wage rates under NEEP inthat province.&#13;
&#13;
      Piece work system and task work system be given preference since labor productivity per&#13;
     hour will be high. It also ensures equal pay for work o f equal value. The gender equality&#13;
      concems can be taken care of. It also makes monitoring task easy and ensures flexibility&#13;
      inwork timings.&#13;
&#13;
      Cash payments o f wages i s desirable since it leaves greater flexibility for household level&#13;
      expenditure allocation decisions. It also avoids logistic problems o f distribution o f food&#13;
      (kind) and more so in an environment with weak institutional base.               Monthly or&#13;
      fortnightly payments depending on the local preferences be adopted. Only during crisis&#13;
      situations like drought, both cash and kindpayments be considered.&#13;
&#13;
     NEEP works should be preferably taken up during agricultural lean seasons to avoid&#13;
     competition between NEEP and agriculture works. However, maintenance works can be&#13;
     taken up inall seasons.&#13;
&#13;
     Village or settlements with very high market wage rates even for unskilled workers&#13;
     should not receivepriority under NEEP. Preference can be accorded to those areas where&#13;
     no other major workhnfrastructure development projects are in operation and the areas&#13;
     identified as the most inaccessible and vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
     Inthe case of secondary roads, iflabor have to move away from their village for longer&#13;
     period, wage rates be billed to compensate for the social costs.&#13;

&#13;
Involvement of Women and Disabled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Women participation in public works in Afghanistan is more a socio-cultural issue and&#13;
       with out the consent o fthe community women cannot take part inpublic and laborbased&#13;
       works. However, some o f the experiences o f NGOs like CARE in central Afghanistan&#13;
       reveal that the community support can be mobilized. Certain types o f works which&#13;
       women like to do exclusively as a group without the presence o f males have to be&#13;
       initiated inthe NEEP. Under irrigation sub-projects women and disabled can be involved&#13;
       inweaving o f gabion baskets. Disabled can also take up the collection and carrying of&#13;
       baskets through horse drawn carriages to the site, Stone dressing and nursery raising are&#13;
       some other activities where in women and disabled can be involved. Under tertiary&#13;
       roads, works closer to the settlement be contracted out to women. Disabledbe involved in&#13;
       activities such as clearing the road side bushes etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Women Social Animators through PRA techniques can elicit the views on choice o f&#13;
       schemes/works, work sharing, institutional arrangements for workfare and time&#13;
       preferences Women can be even involved inmicro-project design as well. Dialogue and&#13;
                    .&#13;
       negotiations with community can help seek the approval for women's participation.&#13;
       Local NGOs be given training in use o f PRA methods by the International and National&#13;
       NGOs like CARE and DACAR . In areas where PRA exercises can not be carried out&#13;
       focus group discussions be attempted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   To promote the participation of women and disabled in NEEP, certain proportion funds&#13;
       from the Bank be earmarked exclusively for these vulnerable groups.( 20 %). Ifincertain&#13;
       regions community acceptance i s not forth coming then that part o f the funds be&#13;
       transferred to the areas where women are allowed to take up works.           Such allocation&#13;
       norms may result in institutional innovations in identifying suitable schemes for women&#13;
       inthe specific socio-cultural context.&#13;

                ENVIRONMENTAND SOCIALSAFEGUARDSFRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
 I. Objectives&#13;
&#13;
 This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework provides general policies, guidelines,&#13;
 codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the proposed World&#13;
 Bank supported National Emergency Employment Program - Rural Roads in Afghanistan.&#13;
 Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective o f this Framework i s to help ensure&#13;
 that activities underthe proposedreconstruction operation will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 0        Protect humanhealth;&#13;
 0        Prevent or compensateany loss of livelihood;&#13;
 0        Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their&#13;
          cumulative effects;&#13;
 0        Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
 0        Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguardpolicies.&#13;
&#13;
 11.      GeneralPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
 Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed project, and the related need for providing&#13;
 immediate employment, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing potential&#13;
 environmentaland social risks, this Framework i s basedon the followingprinciples:&#13;
&#13;
     1. The proposed project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which&#13;
         may not be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's&#13;
          safeguard policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
          implementation for the selection and design of subprojects, and the planning o f&#13;
         mitigation measures;&#13;
&#13;
     2. The proposed project will not support environmental Category A ~ubprojects'~,nor&#13;
          subprojects requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or more people. Consequently, no&#13;
         Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS)will be&#13;
         required. All proposed subprojects will be screenedto ensure that the environmental and&#13;
          social risks can be adequately addressed through the application o f standardized&#13;
         guidelinesand codes o fpractice;&#13;
&#13;
     3. Activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment, such as new road construction&#13;
         (or, related, significantly expanded, infi-astructure), will be supported under subsequent&#13;
         operations;&#13;
&#13;
     4. Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity&#13;
         between ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density.&#13;
         Employment opportunities within the sub-projects will be available on an equal basis to&#13;
         all, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. Inall sub-projects which require&#13;
         consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated consultations&#13;
&#13;

         population; and,&#13;
&#13;
     5.  Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplifiedto meet the special needs of&#13;
         this project. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
         Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the&#13;
         World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
111.     Management of Social and EnvironmentalIssues under the Project&#13;
&#13;
N o significant environmental impacts are anticipated as the Public Works Programonly involves&#13;
repair and rehabilitation of existing rural roads and related access infrastructure. The project i s&#13;
not expected to have any land acquisition or other adverse social impacts, but on the contrary&#13;
significant positive social impacts regarding improved livelihoods. The project i s national in&#13;
scope with a focus on vulnerable districts, and this will enable different ethnic groups to benefit&#13;
from the project. Since the project involves repair and rehabilitation of existing roads, it will not&#13;
impact historical or cultural artifacts. The project implementation manual will include project&#13;
screening, planning and appraisal formats, which will record the environmental and social&#13;
impacts and related mitigation measures for specific sub-projects. Monitoring will include&#13;
reporting on chance archeological finds. The project implementationmanual will be based on the&#13;
Environmental and Social SafeguardsFramework agreedbetween the Government and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The relevant safeguards for this project are Environmental Assessment (OP4.0l),         Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement (OP/BP4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20), and Cultural Property (OPN11.03).&#13;
For all four safeguard policies, the project design follows the criteria and norms laid down inthe&#13;
"Revised Guidance Note on Application of Safeguard Policies for the Afghanistan Program".&#13;
Because individual subproject investments are not known in advance, GOA will adopt a&#13;
programmatic approach, with the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
Environmental impacts&#13;
Impacts are expected to be those associated with the rehabilitation o f rural roads and&#13;
reconstruction o f very small infrastructure (i.e. culverts, stream crossings, retaining structures&#13;
etc.).  Such impacts will be addressed by incorporating standard environmental operating&#13;
procedures into the project manual and technical training courses. To this end, Environmental&#13;
Codes of Practice (ECOPs) will be developed to address environmental issues at design,&#13;
implementation and maintenance stages. ECOPs will incorporate mitigation measures which are&#13;
essentially based on sound engineering, such as erosion protection, provision o f adequate&#13;
drainage, keeping earthwork to a minimum, prevention o f shallow slope failures, etc.&#13;
Implementation will be pursued through terms o f reference and checklists for the implementation&#13;
consultants, who are also responsible for carrying out preliminary environmental screening&#13;
through on-site training and dissemination. Potential induced impacts in environmentally&#13;
sensitive areas will be assessedand documented inthe sub-project planning/appraisal format and&#13;
mitigation measures designed and implemented, if applicable. Inparticular, the project should&#13;
minimize the risk o f further depletion of forest areas resulting from improved access inprovinces&#13;
such as Laghman, Kunar, Nuristan, Paktia, and Badarskhan.&#13;
&#13;
LandAcquisition and Resettlement&#13;
The activities to be undertaken under the proposed project involve rehabilitation of existing&#13;
secondary and tertiary roads that are not likely to involve any land acquisition or have any other&#13;
adverse social impacts. No involuntary resettlement i s anticipated. However, the project's&#13;
Operational Manual will include a fi-ee-standing guideline on land acquisition, and will include a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
process framework for managing land acquisition of any type, voluntary or involuntary. Ifminor&#13;
pieces of land are needed in connection with construction of road structures or changes in road&#13;
alignments? they can only be obtained if the land in question i s govemment land, or though&#13;
voluntary donation (local authorities do not have funds to purchase land). The sub-project&#13;
planning/appraisal format inthe Project Technical Manual will includea check-list recordingany&#13;
amount of land made available by the govemment or privately donated, that the land i s free of&#13;
squatters or other encumbrances, and written proof incase the land i s privately donated, that it is&#13;
provided as a voluntary donation (see Attachment 2(ii) in the project (NEEP-RR) Safeguards&#13;
Framework). Confirmation o f voluntary surrender will be a criterion on the proposal review list&#13;
and will be supervised by the oversight consultants and independent monitors. Bank supervision&#13;
missions will verify that these guidelinesare followed.&#13;
&#13;
Minorities andvulnerable groups&#13;
The project will not cause any adverse impacts on minorities, and the overall project design with&#13;
its targeting o f vulnerable districts within each province will help ensure that different ethnic&#13;
groups participate in the project and receive benefits from it. Within districts, inclusion of&#13;
different ethnic groups as beneficiaries in terms of both income generation through labor&#13;
contracts and improved connectivity will be addressed through the selection of specific sub-&#13;
projects so that these include roads that serve villages inhabited by different ethnic groups. After&#13;
the first year o f implementation, an assessment will be made o f whether this approach has&#13;
succeeded in providing benefits to different groups in ethnically mixed districts. Results and&#13;
recommendations from these studies and project monitoring in minority areas will be an agenda&#13;
item in project annual reviews. Project monitoring will also assess whether within-village&#13;
minorities are beingincluded among project beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
Cultural Property&#13;
Chance archeological finds will be recorded in project monitoring formats, the implementing&#13;
agency will secure the artifact, and the Archeological Committee will be informed of the find.&#13;
Should the continuation of work endanger an archeological site, project activities will be&#13;
suspendeduntila solution i s found.&#13;
&#13;
Mine RiskManagement&#13;
Subprojects will not be implemented without appropriate mine-risk management.                     Current&#13;
practice (evolved during field implementation) for managing mine risk have been robust. A GOA&#13;
procedure for mine risk management (based on these practices) in World Bank funded projects&#13;
has been sent for approval o f the Bank Safeguards. Once approved by the Bank and signed by&#13;
GOA,this will become a part of the project safeguard framework. All risk assessment and&#13;
clearance tasks shall be implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for&#13;
Afghanistan (MACA). These procedures may need to be amended in the future, depending on&#13;
evolving circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
IV. SafeguardScreeningand Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects will be consistent&#13;
with the following guidelines, codes ofpractice andrequirements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2o  Changes inexisting road alignments may be required to eliminate hazards to traffic or to ensure that a&#13;
    particular stretch o f road is passable throughout the year.&#13;

        Projects inAfghanistan, presented(indraft form) inAttachment 5.&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Responsibilitiesfor SafeguardScreeningandMitigation&#13;
&#13;
Two Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed project, the Ministry of&#13;
Reconstruction and Rural Development and the Ministry o f Public Works. Each Ministrywill be&#13;
responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point will be identified with responsibility for&#13;
overseeing the implementationof the Environmental and Social SafeguardsFramework.&#13;
&#13;
The National Emergency Employment Program Coordination Unit (NEEPCU) in the MRRD&#13;
(being supported under this project) will ensure third-party tracking of implementation o f the&#13;
Framework.&#13;
&#13;
V.      CapacityBuildingAndMonitoringOf SafeguardFrameworkImplementation&#13;
&#13;
As part ofthe capacity buildingthat will be provided for implementationof the proposed project,&#13;
the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive&#13;
training in the application o f the Safeguard Framework and specifically during the development&#13;
and implementation o fthe ECOP.&#13;
&#13;
To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
application o f the Framework, GOAwill contract specialist social and environmental services&#13;
within its NEEPCU, and as part of its overall project implementation consultant's team. During&#13;
supervision of these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the&#13;
Framework, and ifrequiredwill recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
The experience of the Labor-based Public Works (LIPW) component under the ongoing&#13;
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP) will be reviewed&#13;
with regardto environmentalissues, landacquisition and other social safeguards issues.&#13;
&#13;
VI.     ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework reflects consultations with the principal&#13;
NGOs and development partners participating inreconstructionactivities inAfghanistan. It will&#13;
be disclosed by GOAin both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made&#13;
available at the World Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                111&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Since no other separate environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under&#13;
the proposed project, no additional disclosure requirements will apply. Inthis regard, however, it&#13;
i s worth noting that GOAintends to make all project documentation publicly available through the&#13;
Afghan Information Management System (AIMS).&#13;

&#13;
        Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition, EntitlementsandCompensation&#13;
&#13;
I.Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Land acquisition will be kept to a minimumand no person will be involuntarily displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed by the proposed project.          Subproject proposals that would require&#13;
demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or&#13;
avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor&#13;
expansion along rights o f way should be reviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition may&#13;
take place outside o f these guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition Assessment i s attached as&#13;
Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that&#13;
all such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their land tenure status, will be assisted to&#13;
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to&#13;
pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People,&#13;
PAPs) and the magnitude o f impacts, projects may be categorizedas S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
&#13;
    a.       S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement o f more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
             where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions&#13;
             will be ineligible for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction&#13;
             operations.&#13;
&#13;
    b.       S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement o f less than 200 persons. In&#13;
             such cases, the following documentation i s required: (1) a land acquisition&#13;
             assessment, (2) the Minutes or record o f consultations which assess the compensation&#13;
             claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record o f the receipt o f the compensation,&#13;
             or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
&#13;
    C.       S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant&#13;
             adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and&#13;
             improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
11.Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affected by the project.&#13;
PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
    (1)      those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structureshuildings,&#13;
             including recognizedcustomary and traditional rights;&#13;
&#13;
    (2)      those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct right&#13;
            rooted incustomary law;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                114&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    (3)     those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall&#13;
            within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
AcquisitionofProductiveAssets and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
PAPSare eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as describedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
        a.       Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals&#13;
              may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or&#13;
              permanently from their land without compensation.&#13;
&#13;
        b.      Contributions against compensation.          A contributorJasset loser considered&#13;
              "affected" will be eligible for compensation from the local community or&#13;
              alternatively from the Government.          A PAP shall lodge hisher claim for&#13;
              compensation to the local community representatives/shura head and it shall be&#13;
              verified by the implementing agency. The claim shall be lodged within 2 weeks o f&#13;
              completion o f the consultations with the concerned community, and before project&#13;
              implementationbegins.&#13;
&#13;
Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.             The&#13;
documentation should specify that the land i s free o f any squatters, encroachers or other claims.&#13;
A format is attached inAttachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
&#13;
111.CompensationPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any o f the following means o f compensation&#13;
are provided ina timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
&#13;
(1)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets&#13;
       with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at&#13;
       replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost&#13;
        assets will be according to following principles:&#13;
&#13;
       a.     replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
              productive assets;&#13;
       b.     materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
       c.     replacement o f damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
       d.     other acceptable in-kindcompensation;&#13;
       e.     in case o f cash compensation, the delivery o f compensation should be made in&#13;
              public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.&#13;
&#13;
(2)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets&#13;
       rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation&#13;
       for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,&#13;
       according to theprinciples in (1) a-d above.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationProcess&#13;
&#13;
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants o f land and owners o f assets located in&#13;
a proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community meetings for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                115&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
each affected mantuqu/gozur (urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to inform the local&#13;
population about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these&#13;
Guidelines.   The Minutes o f the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held,&#13;
agreements reached, and include details o f the agreement, based on the format provided in&#13;
Attachment 2(ii) .&#13;
&#13;
The implementing agency shall provide a copy o f the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each o f them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements&#13;
reached, and any eventual complaint.          Copies will be recorded in the posted project&#13;
documentation and be available for inspection duringsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
&#13;
In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing&#13;
agency shall:&#13;
&#13;
        a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed&#13;
           between the affected person and the local community;&#13;
        b. not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory&#13;
            manner to the affected persons;&#13;
        c.  ifmore than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the subproject shall&#13;
           be deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
&#13;
All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village&#13;
level. If this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation o f the&#13;
agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying&#13;
out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the&#13;
municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the relevant&#13;
implementing agency for a decision.&#13;
&#13;
Verification&#13;
&#13;
The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements o f compensation and evidence o f&#13;
compensation having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising&#13;
engineers, who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when&#13;
they undertake reviews and post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all&#13;
relevant project documents, including details o f the relevant authority for complaints at&#13;
municipal/district or implementing agency level.&#13;

                                   Protectionof CulturalProDertv&#13;
&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f view,&#13;
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites.          Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, andnatural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposedproject i s unlikely to pose a risk o f damaging cultural property, as the sub-projects&#13;
will largely consist repair and reconstruction o f existing secondary and tertiary rural access&#13;
infrastructure. Further, the negative list o f attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible&#13;
for support (Attachment l),    includes any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable&#13;
cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft,&#13;
and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and included instandard bid documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities&#13;
o f cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course o f project&#13;
implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural&#13;
artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
     1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment o f historical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry o f Information&#13;
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
         made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of&#13;
         work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
         untila solutionis foundfor the preservation o fthese artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
     3. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in the countryside o f a&#13;
         province, the provincial governor (wali) or district in-charge (woluswal) should be&#13;
         informed within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
         case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in a city, the provincial branch&#13;
         o f the Department o f Maintenance o f Historical Values o f the Ministry o f Information&#13;
         and Culture should be informed within two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find is made within the&#13;
         center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art.&#13;
        25).&#13;
&#13;
     4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a&#13;
         fine or imprisonment for a period o f one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
     5. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay&#13;
        compensation in accordance with the value o f the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period&#13;
        o f one month to ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  120&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In case o f a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the&#13;
implementing agency i s responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage&#13;
untilthe responsibilityhasbeentaken over bythe relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable.  During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above&#13;
regulations relating to the treatment o f any chance find encounteredare observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o f the&#13;
project's cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity building activities, as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;

   Proceduresfor MineRiskManagementinWorldBankFundedProjectsinAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background:&#13;
&#13;
The following procedures are designed to respond to the risks caused by the presence o f mines in&#13;
Afghanistan, inthe context of:&#13;
         Community rehabilitation / construction works to be identified and implemented by the&#13;
         communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000 each);&#13;
         Small and medium-size works to be identified by local authorities and implemented by&#13;
         local contractors (for projects up to $5m each);&#13;
          Works to be implementeddirectly by Government departments/agencies,without use o f&#13;
         contractors;&#13;
         Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m);&#13;
&#13;
General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance tasks&#13;
shall be implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).&#13;
These procedures may need to be amended inthe future depending on evolving circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Community-ManagedWorks&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitation I construction works to be&#13;
identified and implementedby the communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000&#13;
each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: The communities should be responsible for making sure that the projects they&#13;
propose are not in mine-contaminated areas, or have been cleared by M A C A (or a mine action&#13;
organization accredited by MACA).&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Communities are best placed to know about mined areas in their vicinity, and have a&#13;
strong incentiveto report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1. Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected&#13;
presence o f mines in the area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be&#13;
implemented. This questionnaire should be formally endorsed by the Mine Action Program for&#13;
Afghanistan(MAPA).       It will be a mandatory attachment to the project submission by the&#13;
communities and should be signed by community representatives and the external project&#13;
facilitator. External project facilitators will receive training from MAPA. Financing agreements&#13;
with the communities should make clear that communities are solely liable in case of a mine-&#13;
relatedaccident.&#13;
&#13;
2. If community certifies that there is no known mine contamination inthe area, the ministry&#13;
       the&#13;
responsible for the selection o f projects should check with MACA whether any different&#13;
observation i s reported on MACA's data base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  123&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             o IfMACA's information is the same, the project can go ahead for selection. The&#13;
                 community takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and extemal&#13;
                 organizations cannot be made liable incase o f an accident.&#13;
&#13;
             o IfMACA's information is different, the project should not go ahead for selection&#13;
                 as long as MACA's and community's statements have not beenreconciled.&#13;
&#13;
3. Ifthe community suspects mine contamination inthe area,&#13;
&#13;
             o If the community has included an assessment / clearance task in the project&#13;
                 agreed to be implemented by MACA (or by a mine action organization&#13;
                 accredited byMACA), the project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
             o Ifthe community has not included an assessment / clearance task in the project,&#13;
                 the project should not go ahead for selection as long as this has not been&#13;
                 corrected.&#13;
&#13;
             o Mine clearance tasks must be implemented by MACA or by a mine action&#13;
                 organization accredited by MACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent&#13;
                 funding by World-Bank funded projects shall be reduced or cancelled) if they&#13;
                 elect to clear mines on their own.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor SmallandMedium-sizeWorks ContractedOut&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to small- and medium-size works to be identified by local&#13;
authorities and implementedby local contractors (for projects up to $5m each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated&#13;
general survey or on a new general survey) before projects are considered for selection. Only&#13;
project sites assessed to have a nil-to-low risk would be eligible for selection, unless they have&#13;
been demined by MACA or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the mine-&#13;
related risks ina systematic way, while they may have incentives to underestimate them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1. Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey should be carried out by MACA&#13;
    (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks in the area&#13;
    o f the project (this should include checking information available in the MACA data base).&#13;
&#13;
2. If A C A provides information suggesting a nil-to-low risk in the proposed project area, the&#13;
       M&#13;
    project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
The contract between the responsible ministry and the contractor will include a clause stating that&#13;
in case of an accident, legal liability would be fully and solely borne by the contractor.&#13;
&#13;
3.   IfMACA assesses a potentially highrisk inthe area (whether due to the presence ofmines&#13;
    or uncertainty),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                124&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              o Ifthe project includes an assessment/ clearance task agreed to be implemented&#13;
                  by MACA (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), it can go&#13;
                  ahead for selection based on agreed fundingmodalities (clearance may be funded&#13;
                  either under a contract with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor&#13;
                  agreements with the mine action organization);&#13;
&#13;
              o If the project does not included an assessment / clearance task, it should not go&#13;
                  ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Works to be implemented directly by Government DepartmentdAgencies,&#13;
without use of contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to works to be implemented directly by Government&#13;
departmentdagencies, without use o f contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated&#13;
general survey or on a new general survey) before works or installation o f goods/materials are&#13;
carried out inany given area. Work would only be allowed to proceed inareas assessedto have a&#13;
nil-to-low risk, unless they have been demined by a mine action organization accredited by&#13;
MACA .&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Government departments and agencies responsible for providing services currently do&#13;
not have the capacity to assess the mine-related risks in a systematic way, and currently follow a&#13;
process of consulting with MACA prior to carrying out activities.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1.       Prior to carrying out work, the Government departmedagency will consult with MACA&#13;
to assess mine-related risks inthe area (this should include checking information available in the&#13;
MACA data base). Ifnot already done, a general survey shouldbe carriedout byMACA (or by a&#13;
mine action organization accredited by MACA)to assess mine-related risks inthe area.&#13;
&#13;
2.       If providesdetailedinformationonmine-relatedriskswhichsuggestanil-to-low&#13;
           MACA&#13;
risk in the proposed area, the work can proceed. The Government would be solely liable in case&#13;
o f a mine-related accident.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Ifinformation providedbyMACA cannot support the assessment of a nil-to-low riskin&#13;
the proposed area (whether due to the presence o f mines or uncertainty), works should not go&#13;
ahead before MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) carries out the&#13;
necessary further assessment and/or clearance for risks to be downgraded to nil-to-low, based on&#13;
agreed funding modalities (clearance may be funded either under a contract with a Bank-funded&#13;
project or under existing donor agreements with the mine action organization).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 125&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procedure for Large Works Using Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to large works to be implemented by large contractors&#13;
(projects above $5m).&#13;
&#13;
Overallapproach: The main contractor should be responsible for dealing with mine-related risks,&#13;
incoordinationwiththe UNMineAction Center.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1. As part of the preparation of the biddingdocuments, a general survey should be carried out&#13;
    by MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) on all the areas where&#13;
    contractors may have to work (broadly defined).          This survey should provide detailed&#13;
    information on mine-related risks in the various areas allowing for an un-ambiguous&#13;
    identification of areas that have a nil-to-low risk of mine/UXO contamination and areas&#13;
    where the risk is either higher or unknown. The survey should be financed out of the&#13;
    preparation costs of the biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
All survey information should be communicated to the bidders (with sufficient legal caveats so&#13;
that it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning o f their activities (e.g.,&#13;
location o f campsites, access roads to quarries).&#13;
&#13;
2. Dependingon the nature and location of the project and on the available riskassessment, two&#13;
    differentoptions canbeused.&#13;
&#13;
Option 1-Mine-clearance activities are part o f the general contract&#13;
&#13;
    a. Based on the general survey results, a specific budget provision for mine action during&#13;
    constructioni s set aside as a separate provisional sum inthe tender documents for the general&#13;
    contract.&#13;
&#13;
    b. As a separately identified itemin their bid, the bidders include a provision for a further&#13;
    detailed mine assessment and clearance duringconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
    c. On the instruction of the Supervision Engineer and drawing on the specific provisional&#13;
    sum for mine action in the contract, the contractor uses one of several nominated sub-&#13;
    contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to be rapidly available on&#13;
    call, to carry out assessment prior to initiation of physical works inpotentially contaminated&#13;
    areas, and to conduct clearance tasks as he finds may be needed. The Contractor may also&#13;
    hire an international specialist to assist him in preparing and supervising these tasks. The&#13;
    Contractor is free to chose which o f the accredited sub-contractors to use, and he i s fully&#13;
    responsible for the quality o f the works and i s solely liable in case of accident after an area&#13;
    hasbeendemined.&#13;
&#13;
    d. To avoid an "over-use" of the budget provision, the Contractor is requiredto inform the&#13;
    Supervision Engineerin writing (with a clearjustification o f the works to be carried out) well&#13;
    inadvanceofmobilizing the mine-clearingteam. The Supervision Engineer hasthe capacity&#13;
    to object to such works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 126&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Option 2 -Mine-clearance activities are carried out under a separate contract&#13;
&#13;
    a. Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveying and/or clearing o f&#13;
    areas with a not-nil-to-low risk (under the supervision o f the Engineer) by specialized&#13;
    contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The definition o f the areas&#13;
    to be further surveyed I cleared should be limited to those areas where any contractor would&#13;
    have to work, and should not include areas such as camp sites and quarrieslmaterial sites&#13;
    which are to be identified by the Contractor during and after bidding o f the works. As a&#13;
    result o f these further surveys and possibly clearance works, mine-related risk in the entire&#13;
    contract area i s downgraded to nil-to-low.&#13;
&#13;
    b. The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent o f the portion o f the&#13;
    construction site o f which the Contractor i s to be given possession from time to time, clearly&#13;
    indicating restrictions o f access to areas where the mine risk i s not nil-to-low.     It also&#13;
    indicates the target dates at which these areas will be accessible. Following receipt o f the&#13;
    notice to commence works from the Engineer, the Contractor can start work inall other areas.&#13;
&#13;
    c. The general Contractor i s invited to include in its bid an amount for mine-security, to&#13;
    cover any additional survey I clearance he may feel necessary to undertake the works.&#13;
&#13;
4. Incase o f an accident, a Boardo f Inquiryis assembled by M A C A to investigate on the causes&#13;
of the accident and determine liabilities. Large penalties should be applied on the Contractor if&#13;
the Board determines that the accident resulted from a breach o f safety rules.&#13;
&#13;
5. All parties involved in this process are required to closely coordinate with M A C A and to&#13;
provide the Government, local communities, MACA, as well as any interested party the full&#13;
available information on mine-related risks that may reasonably be required (e.g., maps o f&#13;
identifiedminefields, assessments for specific areas).&#13;

EXECUTIVESUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Purpose&#13;
The purpose o f this Manual' i s to assist the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to develop an&#13;
implementation plan and detailed procedures for a Labor Intensive Works Program (LIWP) a&#13;
component o f the Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP).&#13;
The secondphase of the work plans for inclusion of the MIWREfor Irrigationworks as well as a&#13;
role of MRRD for coordinated targeting of rural infrastructure. The Ministry of Martyrs and&#13;
Disabled will be an associated ministry to address the targeting of vulnerable disabled wage&#13;
earners and families where feasible.&#13;
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is to be specifically for the LIWP and has followed&#13;
the earlier generic forms of (PIMs) as a tool for implementing small public works inAfghanistan&#13;
under various aid initiatives reflecting policies of the Islamic Transitional Government of&#13;
Afghanistan (ITGA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
The objective of the LIWP i s to support economic recovery, using labor intensive mechanisms to&#13;
improve selectedrural infrastructure.&#13;
This will be achieved by:&#13;
         o providingemployment opportunities through labor-basedreconstructionactivities.&#13;
         o carrying out urgent reconstruction andrehabilitationworks for roadworks to improve&#13;
             rural transport; and&#13;
&#13;
The outcomes of the component are expected to be improvements inrural infrastructure, which&#13;
will reduce transport costs providing lower input costs and higher profits to for agricultural&#13;
products, which would improve the basis for sustainable livelihoods. A major ancillary objective&#13;
will be the transfer of project implementation skills to MoPW counterparts, developing Afghan&#13;
capacity to carry out similar works at International standards for execution and financial&#13;
accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
The Project would be implementedover an 12monthperiod. The LIWPwill be implementedby&#13;
the UNOPS with MOPW(MIWRE) for urgent, labor-based, rehabilitation work such as road&#13;
rehabilitation and small structure repair.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selected Provinces&#13;
The ITGA's intention is to ensure a wide distribution o f reconstruction support around the&#13;
country within the practical constraints o f the roadinfrastructure sectors and proposed&#13;
interventions, which will be supported by other donors. All Provinces of Afghanistan have been&#13;
targeted for these activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The procedures documented inthis manual are based o n the 14-year UNOPS experience inRural&#13;
Rehabilitation inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                129&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Allocations&#13;
To ensure a needs-baseddistribution of Program funds, allocations to each o f the provinces has&#13;
been calculated on criteria related to the relative numbers of people residing in those provinces.&#13;
This Programo fUS$ 12,000,000 inthe first phase, will support labor intensivepublic works sub-&#13;
projects at three levels. Those community works less than $30,000; a majority of engineering&#13;
works up to $100,000; and a limitednumber of larger works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement,FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit Arrangements&#13;
Assistance with procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWP will be&#13;
provided by the UNOPS as the Implementing Agency (IA). Under LIWP a primary objective i s&#13;
to buildMinistry capacity for these functions. To ensure that functional capacity i s built up, the&#13;
Implementing Agency will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as deemed&#13;
necessary to ensure they develop capacity to eventually carry out these core functions on their&#13;
own. This will be done though formal daily training sessions in addition to the hands-on project&#13;
work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoringand Evaluation&#13;
The IA, will prepare and submit to the MOPW, quarterly progress reports showing progress&#13;
towards meeting implementation and development objectives for all the sub-projects they are&#13;
implementing. The external progressreporting of LIWPwill be the responsibility of the MOPW,&#13;
which will submit to the IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalAnd SocialAspects&#13;
The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through an&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework).&#13;
The sub-projects envisaged under the LIWP are not expected to generate significant negative&#13;
environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to the improvement o f environmental&#13;
conditions. The Framework provides a list of items ineligible for support under the ECEPWP&#13;
and, by implication therefore, items which are not eligible investments for LIWP sub-projects to&#13;
financed under the ECEPWP. The Framework provides social and environmental mitigation&#13;
measuresto be incorporated inthe design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ParticipatoryApproach&#13;
Participationand consultations with beneficiaries will take placethrough the traditional district&#13;
shuras/organizations inconjunction with the District administrations. Project design and sub-&#13;
project selection will aim at maintainingequity between various groups of the population.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
 1.1     Purpose&#13;
The purpose o f this Manual' is to assist the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) to develop an&#13;
implementation plan and detailed procedures for a Labor Intensive Works Program (LW) a&#13;
component o f the Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP).&#13;
The secondphaseof the work plans for inclusionofthe MrWRE for Irrigation works as well as a&#13;
role of MRRD for coordinated targeting of rural infrastructure. The Ministry of Martyrs and&#13;
Disabled will be an associated ministry to address the targeting of vulnerable disabled wage&#13;
earners and families where feasible.&#13;
The Project ImplementationManual (PIM) has been drawn from a generic form of PIM designed&#13;
to be used for the World Bank financed works, as a tool for implementing small public works in&#13;
Afghanistan under various aid initiatives, reflecting policies of the Islamic Transitional&#13;
Government of Afghanistan (ITGA). The PIM would, off course, need to be reviewed and&#13;
possibly adapted to meet the requirements of additional donor agencies that may become&#13;
involved. This i s particularly true for the financial disbursementmechanism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.2      Objective&#13;
The objective of the LrWP is to support economic recovery, usinglabor intensive mechanisms to&#13;
improve selectedrural infrastructure.&#13;
This will be achievedby:&#13;
The outcomes of the component are expected to be improvements in road infrastructure, which&#13;
will reduce transport costs providing lower input costs and higher profits to for agricultural&#13;
products, which would improve the basis for sustainable livelihoods. A major ancillary objective&#13;
will be the transfer of project implementation skills to MoPW counterparts, developing Afghan&#13;
capacity to carry out similar works at International standards for execution and financial&#13;
accountability.&#13;
         o providingemployment opportunities through labor-basedreconstructionactivities.&#13;
         o carrying out urgentreconstruction andrehabilitationworks for roadworks to improve&#13;
             rural transport; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3      Implementation&#13;
The Project would be implementedover a 12 month period. The LIWP will be implementedby&#13;
the UNOPS with MOPW(MrWRE) for urgent, labor-based, rehabilitation work such as road&#13;
rehabilitation and small structure repair.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3.1. SelectedMunicipalities&#13;
The ITGA's intention is to ensure a wide distribution o f reconstruction support around the&#13;
country within the practical constraints of the roadinfrastructure sectors and proposed&#13;
interventions, which will be supported by other donors. All Provinces o f Afghanistan have been&#13;
targeted for these activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'The procedures documented inthis manual are based on the 14-year UNOPS experience inRural&#13;
Rehabilitation inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 132&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 1.3.2   Allocation of Fundsto Towns&#13;
To ensure a needs-based distribution o f Program funds, allocations to each o f the provinces will&#13;
be loosely based on criteria related to the relative numbers o f people residing inthose provinces.&#13;
This Program of US$ 12,000,OO will support labor intensive public works sub-projects at three&#13;
levels.  Those community works less than $30,000; a majority o f engineering works up to&#13;
$100,000; and a limited number o f larger works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1.3.3. Procurement,FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit Arrangements&#13;
Procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWP will be provided by the&#13;
UNOPS as the ImplementingAgency (IA). Under LIWP a primary objective i s to buildMinistry&#13;
capacity for these functions. To ensure that functional capacity i s built up, the Implementing&#13;
Agency will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as deemed necessary to&#13;
ensure they develop capacity to eventually carry out these core functions on their own. This will&#13;
be done though formal daily training sessions inaddition to the hands-on project work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3.4   Monitoring andEvaluation&#13;
The IA, will prepare and submit to the MOPW, quarterly progress reports showing progress&#13;
towards meeting implementation and development objectives for all the sub-projects they are&#13;
implementing. The external progress reporting o f LIWP will be the responsibility o f the MOPW,&#13;
which will submit to the IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.4     Environmental And Social Aspects&#13;
The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through an&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework).&#13;
The sub-projects envisaged under the LIWP are not expected to generate significant negative&#13;
environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to the improvement o f environmental&#13;
conditions. The Framework provides a list o f items ineligible for support under the ECEPWP&#13;
and, by implication therefore, items which are not eligible investments for LIWP sub-projects to&#13;
financed under the ECEPWP. The Framework provides social and environmental mitigation&#13;
measures to be incorporated inthe design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.5     Participatory Approach&#13;
Participation and consultations with beneficiaries will take place through the traditional district&#13;
shuras/organizations in conjunction with the District administrations. Project design and sub-&#13;
project selection will aim at maintainingequity between various groups o f the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2       OBJECTIVESAND OUTCOMES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1     General Objectives&#13;
The objective o f this Project i s to assist ATA inrehabilitating the rural infrastructure/ feeder road&#13;
network in all provinces in order to: (a) provide a rapid infusion o f cash to rural communities&#13;
through a Labor based methodology; (b) ensure preservation o f existing infrastructure/road&#13;
assets; (c) induce revival o f economic activities; and (d) concurrently building subsequent&#13;
capacity to allow the MOPW led team to manage similar interventions directly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The immediate physical objective of the Project is: (a) to repadmaintain sections of rural&#13;
infrastructure and farm to market roads that have failed due to war related damage and many&#13;
years without maintenance; and (b) to rehabilitate the infrastructure to meet the original&#13;
functional requirements. The direct emergency objective i s to get cash into the hands of rural&#13;
families in order to assist them in coping with the onset of winter as well as preparation for the&#13;
next agricultural season.&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, UNOPS partnership will provide training for counterpart staff in procurement,&#13;
project design and management. It will include detailed training on subproject contracting at&#13;
international standards for design, costing, tender, bid review and evaluation, engineering&#13;
supervision, monitoring and financial supervision.          The output o f this objective is a&#13;
MoPW(MIWm) better prepared to accept and deliver and account for international funds at&#13;
international standards, enhancing the likelihood of future direct funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The above objectives will be achieved through the provision of consultancy services, works,&#13;
equipment, and supplies for infrastructure/road building activities identified and prioritised by&#13;
ATAiMoPW(MIWRE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2      Specific Objectives&#13;
The project hasthe following specific objectives. Corresponding planned activities are subject to&#13;
modifications that may be agreed between MoPW(MIWRE) and UNOPS as needed to achieve&#13;
the following objectives:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Immediateand sustainedincometo Labor force&#13;
&#13;
        This will be accomplished by the immediate certification of field staff and deployment&#13;
         for Level One Engineeringsubprojects. Sites in 8 regions located close to provincial and&#13;
        district centers will be prioritized with identified vulnerable areas receiving initial&#13;
        attention. Activities o f limited engineering, but necessary to protect and improve roads,&#13;
        such as drainage works, leveling, and culvert rehabilitatiordcleaning will be targeted.&#13;
        Limited surface rehabilitation for roads not requiring substantial survey/design will also&#13;
        begin. Community groups are organized through shuras to carry out necessaryworks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Rural Infrastructure rehabilitated to appropriate quality and implementation&#13;
        standards.&#13;
        Concurrent to the above activity, survey/design and costing for EngineeringLevel 2&amp;3&#13;
        subprojects will be developed, necessary procurement and training completed and&#13;
        preparations made for construction in those areas where the winter conditions will allow&#13;
        activities. Inhigher elevations, preparations will continue through winter to allow for a&#13;
        fast spring start -up. Staff will be shifted to the warmer locations to complete some&#13;
        provincial work early allowing reallocation o f assets in early 2003 to higherhorthern&#13;
        locations as weather permits.&#13;
&#13;
        UNOPS will apply the existing Subproject contract methodology, developed through&#13;
        more than 14 years o f Rural Engineering inAfghanistan, to insure all aspects o f project&#13;
        activities are transparent and accountable at international standards.        The general&#13;
        methodology will use information coordinated under the provincial Governors office to&#13;
        set priority targets in all Provinces for Labor Intensive works. It will then divide works&#13;
        into three Technical categories to allow immediate cash infusion on least demanding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 134&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         sections, but allowing time for proper Design, and engineering of more technical&#13;
         structures in Category 2 and 3.      It uses subproject procedures that divide work into&#13;
         ceilings that allow smaller projects to be regionally approved with larger projects having&#13;
         an expedited appraisal at Kabul level. Financial delegations are up to $30,000 with the&#13;
         UNOPS STA and $100,000 with UNOPS STA after LCC review inKabul.&#13;
&#13;
UNOPS will apply the Roads RehabilitationTechnical manual developed more than 10 years ago&#13;
and already translated into local languages as the interim standard for these roads.&#13;
Implementation will use approved UNOPS subproject documentation and certification.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
         UNOPS subcontracting and admidfinance documentation modified and translated to&#13;
         support activities above. Government staff trained in use and compliance.          Slower&#13;
         construction seasons will allow or heavier training levels.      Topics cover subproject&#13;
         management of road works as well as all procurement, administrative and financial&#13;
         procedures. Trainings will be output oriented with staff certified and costs covered only&#13;
         for objectives achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Maintenancecapacity developed andtrained&#13;
&#13;
         Also concurrently to construction above a manual focused on maintenance of these&#13;
         Public works will be designed and translated for use. This will complement equipment&#13;
         purchased as Area based assets and staff trained to allow a limited deployment of&#13;
         maintenance and construction equipment (this component would be expanded to all&#13;
         Provinces ifadditional fundwere allocated).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3      General Outcomes&#13;
The outcomes of the component are expected to be more income to rural populations, cheaper&#13;
transport facilities, which contribute to sustainable livelihoods, as well as improved government&#13;
systems for project delivery which i s fundamental to sector reform and institution building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.4      Specific Outcomes&#13;
Through an integrated approach to Labor-intensive works and Road rehabilitation to accepted&#13;
standards involving communities, local NGOs, line ministries and technical departments o f the&#13;
Government, a number of hard and soft outputs will be achieved under the contract. The&#13;
verifiable indicators o fthe hard outputs for Phase 1are:&#13;
&#13;
      0   The potential rehabilitation o f between 2000-5000 Kilometers o f road dependent on&#13;
           starting road condition of targeted sections.&#13;

4        THE IMPLEMENTATIONMODEL&#13;
&#13;
4.1      The Project Process&#13;
The manual focuses on the subproject process o f the LIWP as shown on the following page and&#13;
details a typical cycle with five stages o f process (one being the subcontracted implementation).&#13;
This manual encompasses these stages o f the process and includes a separate set o f subproject&#13;
financial processes.     UNOPS guidelines for actual project implementation will be used for&#13;
procurement, staffing and regular financial operations. These are available through the UNOPS&#13;
handbook and the UNOPS Web site system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2      The Role and responsibilities of the MOPW&#13;
MOPW at the National level is the coordinating Ministry within the ITGA, and the line ministry&#13;
responsible for all Area and Provincial activity. The duties o f the MOPW with respect to the&#13;

       0  the Provincial and Area level to assist survey and design and supervise the&#13;
          subcontracting, procurement and implementatiodcertification.&#13;
The policy o f the ITGA i s to use Project ImplementationTeams within government institutions.&#13;
These groups will, inter alia, effectively take part in the rehabilitation and reconstruction o f the&#13;
Country. The contract implementation function would be contracted out to the private sector.&#13;
In this regard, the role o f the implementing agency would be to implement the Program with&#13;
counterpart staff participationat all levels to insure skills transfer. SpecificallyUNOPS will have&#13;
legal responsibility for subcontracting, procurement and financial administration.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5       SUB-PROJECTIDENTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
5.1.    Sub-project identificationthroughstakeholder participation&#13;
The success o f LIWP depends on adequate stakeholder participation. While the time constraint&#13;
will not allow for in depth relationships to be built between planners, implementers and local&#13;
communities, processes can be tailored to the three levels o f projects expected that will allow&#13;
adequate dialogue before selection. Whenever resources are brought to the community level,&#13;
especially in a post conflict environment - care must be taken to insure that the allocation o f&#13;
resources i s made using decision making bodies that are credible in the eyes o f the people&#13;
affected.  In rural Afghanistan this means community leaders, District level shura bodies,&#13;
Woleswals, Provincial technical staff and members o f the Govemment ministries. This project&#13;
will rely on, and try to assist the capacity development of, provincial coordination mechanisms&#13;
under the office o f Govemor.&#13;
Inorder to ensure that the rural Afghan population benefits from the LIWP it is important to&#13;
ensure that the sub-project selection procedure i s o f a demand driven nature. This ranges fi-om&#13;
where the vulnerability needs are most acute for the initial quick cash Level One interventions, to&#13;
where the road rehabilitation needs will bring the most lasting benefiting o f Engineering based&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2     Subproject ceilings&#13;
The LIPW project separates the interventions into two distinct categories.       First are simple&#13;
smaller projects that require minimal or n o engineering and simpler community based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               138&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contracting/execution arrangements     -Level 1. Second are those of a more advanced technical&#13;
nature - still Labor based but requiring adequate levels of engineering intervention. This to&#13;
ensure the result i s improved infrastructure inthe med-longterm rather than the inappropriate use&#13;
o f Labor in interventions that lack any sustained impact.         These are considering in this&#13;
implementation plan as Level 2 &amp; 3 interventions and for which the details subproject cycle will&#13;
be discussedmomentarily.&#13;
&#13;
5.3      Level One&#13;
(Small-scale, always less than $30,000 for community-based labor intense works)&#13;
To be successful ina major objective of the Program- cashput inthe hands of rural Labor force&#13;
immediately - the project must be able to identifyinterventions that can be carried out quickly -&#13;
inmany casesbeforeheexpectedarrivalofthe winter seasoninseveralmonths. These will avoid&#13;
major construction works and focus on Labor intensive procedures that either address the&#13;
immediate rehabilitation needs of roads with limited damage or act to do simple preparation for&#13;
more damaged sectors that will be addressedunder Levels 2&amp;3.&#13;
&#13;
These activities include, brushremoval and Boulder removal. They cover Ditching, slopinghack&#13;
sloping, and the cutting of mitre drains - all of which will address the initial rehabilitation needs&#13;
of the roadway but also act to provide a substantial period of protection that avoids further&#13;
damage before more substantial road works are carried out. Near to future sites for retaining&#13;
walls and drainage structures, preparatory andprotective activities canbe done to allow the use of&#13;
labor alone to improve the situation through backfilling and compaction. In selected sites, with&#13;
the available inputs, limitedgabion protectioncouldbe added.&#13;
&#13;
These activities will require an expedited mechanism for selection, approval and implementation&#13;
inorder to achieve the statedobjectives. Inorder to allow this streamlining a first step hasbeen&#13;
to determine a ceiling for individual project size that allows maximum community participation, a&#13;
limited need for technical oversight and less likelihood through lower financial ceilings of&#13;
financial impropriety. This ceiling is suggested initially at $30,000 per activity for community&#13;
managed works. Based on Labor costs of about $2 a day plus supervision costs of $4 for one&#13;
crew chief on every 25 workers and a $5 daily fee for the project foreman, 50-250 workers can&#13;
benefit from two months of seasonalwork before winter sets in,inhundreds of target locations.&#13;
&#13;
Level One subprojects must match the technically appropriate sectors o f road rehabilitation with&#13;
those locations having populations perceived as most vulnerable. Appropriate administers for&#13;
activities must be identified, detailed summary sheets and Cost estimates supplied. Target&#13;
outputs through a simple design and bill o f quantity format agreed, advances provided and&#13;
monitoring and certification carried out. All in a fairly expedited but adequately documented&#13;
process. Administrators will be responsible to insure the specified workforce works the specified&#13;
hours/days as agreed in advance. Monitoring will adjust payments for a percent o f compliance.&#13;
Level One projects will be administered under this streamlined procedure.&#13;
&#13;
A distinct component of the Level 1 works will be identified for vulnerable households and&#13;
families with Disability. Appropriate community works ranging from a physical nature where&#13;
appropriate, to activities within community institutions such as schools and mosques, as well as&#13;
available apprenticeship training will be on offer. Organized through community elders and&#13;
school/church leaders and coordinated through the provincial and regional Ministry of Martyrs&#13;
and Disabled offices, this component will be an add-on to works developed through the regular&#13;
mechanism. This use of existing operations allows the component to be added for little additional&#13;
cost other than the actual labor payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 See Level One Annex&#13;
&#13;
5.4      Level Two &amp; Three&#13;
(Labor-based Engineeringworks)&#13;
&#13;
For Level 2 and 3 engineeringbased subprojects the process becomes more formalized where&#13;
both technical information from a variety of sources and local confirmation are used to narrow&#13;
down the potential sub projects. In order to achieve maximum stakeholder participation the&#13;
active support o f many agencies both vertically and horizontally integrated into the provinces i s&#13;
essential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6        SUB-PROJECTPROCUREMENTPROCESS&#13;
The method of procurement is a function of the modality selected for project implementation.&#13;
Essentially there are two options; community contracting and commercial contracting (includes&#13;
NGOswilling to register as contractors).&#13;
For all levels, that prioritization and appraisal process is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.1      Project Initiation&#13;
Technical information from Provincial, International, Government technical body sources i s&#13;
collected within the framework for the Provincial Technical Team (PTT)concept under the&#13;
coordination o f the Governor and benefiting from participation of counterpart ministry&#13;
participationas they become operational at Provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
      0    Information on vulnerable areas i s           compared against potential appropriate&#13;
           infrastructure/road sectors.&#13;
      0    Province/District level surveys review sectors and availability o f local Labor pool.&#13;
      0    Short listed sectors submitted by Area Engineers and PTT usingthe following criteria:&#13;
             *:*  degree of Labor intensity;&#13;
             *:*  economic impact;&#13;
             *:*  consultation with and endorsement by local civil society/ community groups.&#13;
Each sub-project i s reviewedby the Provincial Team for the degree of impact it has on all three of&#13;
the above criteria.&#13;
Since providing employment is the main objective of the LIWP, it i s given the highest weighting.&#13;
The suggestedguidelines for weightings are as follows:&#13;
             *:* Employment: 40%&#13;
             *3 Economic impact: 40%&#13;
             *:* Consultationwith civil society: 20%&#13;
         The prioritization will be done by majority opinion of the complete Provincial team inan&#13;
         open fomm.&#13;
The Area teams,with the provincial Governors concurrence will recommend prioritizedproposals&#13;
and provide the relevant information to the Kabul LIPW team. The Kabul team will enter the&#13;
information into the National database and ifwithout objection instruct the Area provincial teams&#13;
to:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
6.5       Projectsfundedby directlyby donors&#13;
Insome cases where projects are funded directly by donors, the approval mechanism of these&#13;
sub-projects will be agreed between the implementingpartner and the donor concerned prior to&#13;
receipt o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7         PRE-QUALIFICATION OF CONTRACTORSAND NGOS&#13;
&#13;
7.1       Database/ Register&#13;
Using the UNOPS Contractor database, the register will be updated at the Provincial level to&#13;
include all firms / contractors / NGOs wishingto bid for works under this Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.2       QualificationCriteria&#13;
For Level 2&amp;3, it i s anticipated that the civil works on most projects will be relatively&#13;
(technically) simple. The proposed criteria, is therefore that the contractors must have performed&#13;
at least three similar sized contracts previously. This criteria couldbe set for contracts above, say&#13;
$10,000 and below which, no previous jobs will be required (this could encourage local&#13;
entrepreneursto start new businesses for smalljobs).&#13;
Other appropriate qualificationcriteria are chosenfor larger works (see registrationform).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.3      ApplicationForms&#13;
Each Provincial office should maintain freely available copies of application forms for&#13;
registration. Advertisements and Radio/TV notify potential contractors of the process in each&#13;
Area and Kabul&#13;
&#13;
8        REQUESTSFOR QUOTATIONS&#13;
             Tendering will follow the UNOPS approved standards, (forms attached - Invitation&#13;
             to bid, information letter, endorsement sheet, tender document).&#13;
             Contracts will be awarded on the basis of the receipt, evaluation and comparison of&#13;
             all, but at least three (3) competitive quotes.&#13;
             Where considerable numbers of firms have registered, tenders should be allowed by&#13;
             only those firms registered and with capacity for the specific region and type of&#13;
             intervention.      Ifover subscription occurs UNOPS will propose a tender document&#13;
             charge to cover printing and review charges that should reduce the number of&#13;
             applications.&#13;
             Quotations will be requestedby a specific time on a specific date.&#13;
             A secure Tender box will be placed inan appropriate room ineachprovincial Office&#13;
             into which quotations can beplaceddirectly by the contractors.&#13;
             All contractors submitting quotations will be invited to attend the opening of&#13;
             quotations. This shall take place at the time and date specified for quotations (i.e. at&#13;
             6 above).&#13;
             The quotations shallbe openedand the followingdetails announced:&#13;
             Name of Contractor&#13;
             Quotation Price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  142&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Each quotation will be evaluated to check that all of the technical and commercial&#13;
             requirements of the Invitation to Quote document have been fully met.&#13;
             Quotations with substantial non-compliance will be rejected and not considered&#13;
             further inthe selection process. However, the firms submittingsuch quotations will&#13;
             be given a chance to learn of the non-compliance inan interview conducted after the&#13;
             selection processhas beencompleted.&#13;
             Quotations that are substantially compliant will be compared.&#13;
             The lowestpricedquotation will berecommended for the contract.&#13;
             Due to the tendency for firms to underbid to get projects and potentially misuse&#13;
             mobilization advances, any lowest bid that i s more than 10% lower than market&#13;
             estimates, would be required to work without mobilization advance and be paid on&#13;
             the basis of 90% o f work performedwith fullpayment after completion.&#13;
             The review team will prepare abriefevaluation report.&#13;
&#13;
8.1      Award of contracts&#13;
The Contract will be drafted with the firm submitting the lowest responsive evaluated quotation.&#13;
The Consultant's Senior International Engineer shall complete the Letter of Acceptance form&#13;
attached to the Invitation to Quote document. This shall be signed and approved by the following&#13;
parties:&#13;
         Review Team&#13;
         Contractor&#13;
Contracts under $30,000 will be signed by UNOPS STA, those between $30,000 and $100,000&#13;
will be signed by the UNOPS STA after LCC or NY review, and those over $100,000 must be&#13;
approved by UNOPS NY.&#13;
Tender, Bidevaluation, and contracting forms are annexed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.2      Contractperformance&#13;
Although day-to-day monitoring of sub-projects is carried out at the provincial level, the MOPW&#13;
i s responsible for overall project monitoring. The PC will, with the help o f the implementing&#13;
agency in each province, monitor the progress of each sub-project. The Implementingagency i s&#13;
responsible for the execution o f the works, but MOPW will make sure that the Program o f works&#13;
i s being adhered to. Likewise, MOPW will monitor timely disbursement o f the funds UNOPS&#13;
provides to the contactors. The role of the MOPW i s very much as a co-ordinator. It will make&#13;
decisions on policy matters and help to expedite and facilitate disbursements between IDA and&#13;
the Implementing agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Contracts are monitored at three levels. Provincial Technical Teams, Area Teams&#13;
            and random checks by the International Advisor teams.&#13;
            This is in addition to regular informal checking and monitoring b interested&#13;
            community groups and local authorities.&#13;
            Regular monitoring results in Subprojects monitoring reports submitted by&#13;
            engineering staff and is terminated with the final "End of Subproject Report issued&#13;
            on completion.&#13;
            Engineeringworks will have a retentionperiod of 6 weeks to 3 months before a final&#13;
            release o fthe money that remains as security deposit and guarantee of good work.&#13;
            A handover with community and local authorities is thendocumented.&#13;
            Maintenance reportingbegins through MoPW field staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                143&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            Additionally an internal audit department will review regional BOQ rates and spot&#13;
             check actual quantities against project site visits to confirm transparency and&#13;
             accountability.&#13;
             Contactors failing to follow all procedures and who perform poorly will face&#13;
             disciplinary action that may include suspension and expulsion from future&#13;
             contractingopportunities.&#13;
&#13;
8.3     Procedures for Public Sector Contracting&#13;
The contracting bypublic sector for the LIWP funds is not allowed under the fundingrules ofthis&#13;
project but may bepermissible under rules of different donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.4     Facilitationof disbursement&#13;
The UNOPS Finance officer using the UNOPS - US$ Imprest account will facilitate the&#13;
disbursement o f funds as per UNOPS procedures, through UNOPS staff. UNOPS will request&#13;
the opening o f a convertible account at the Da Afghanistan Bank to handle local transactions. In&#13;
the interim the existing Imprest will be used. Contract will be calculated in Dollars but paid at&#13;
the bank exchange rate at time of disbursement. Contractors will be encouraged to open local&#13;
accounts for payment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.5     Provisionof project co-ordination/support&#13;
The MOPW will be responsible for project co-ordination and support. The Project Co-ordinator&#13;
(PC) will be responsible for providing MoPW NOCs to batches of sub-projects over $30,000.&#13;
Projects less than $30,000 have the implicit approcal throughthe Ministrycounterpart on the Arae&#13;
Team. PTTs will monitor the progress of the sub-projects. Area Teams with MOPW monitors&#13;
will check results.&#13;

10        DEMINING,ENVIRONMENTAL,AND SOCIAL RISKS&#13;
The best information on the potential for mines in a given area lies with the local communities&#13;
them selves. All proposed LIWPprojects must be certifiedby the local communities as ina Low-&#13;
to-Nil risk environment. Level 2&amp;3 Subprojects will be passed to the Regional RMAC for their&#13;
confirmation o fno information contrary to a Low-to-Nil Riskfactor.&#13;
The reconstruction and rehabilitation interventions envisaged under the proposed project are not&#13;
expected to generate significant negative environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to&#13;
the improvement o f environmental conditions. Limited adverse impacts could result, however,&#13;
fiom inadequate design and construction practices.          T o limit the extent o f these risks, the&#13;
Environmental Framework -developed for other IDA funded interventions - provides a negative&#13;
list o f activities ineligible for support under the proposed project.&#13;
T o mitigate the remaining potential impacts, the guidelines and codes o f practice included in the&#13;
Framework provide social and environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated in the&#13;
design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects. These are made operational through the&#13;
specific site checklists for Level 2&amp;3 works and addressed as necessary through the initial&#13;
prioritizationprocess and documentation for Level One works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
No activities will be supported that require involuntary land acquisition or the acquisition o f land&#13;
requiring the resettlement or compensation o f more than 200 people.              Consequently, no&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan will be required for these types o f projects.&#13;

12.1    Procurement,FinancialManagement, DisbursementandAudit Arrangements&#13;
Procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWPwill be undertaken through&#13;
UNOPS procedures by delegatedUNOPS staff.&#13;
For procurement, the MOPW, would provide technical input. To ensure that works procurement&#13;
capacity i s built up, UNOPS will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as&#13;

            Afghanistan - National Emergency Employment
            Program for Rural Access Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The National Emergency Employment
            Program for Rural Access Project for Afghanistan, which
            forms a part of the Government's National Emergency
            Employment Program (NEEP), will assist the Government in
            providing targeted social protection, and improving key
            rural access infrastructure to improve the livelihoods of
            the rural poor in the Government's territory by
            providing: (i) emergency short term employment opportunities
            for the poor on labor-based rural access infrastructure
            improvement subprojects; and (ii) technical assistance for
            the implementation of NEEP. The Credit portion will finance
            the reconstruction of secondary rural access
            infrastructure--primarily bridges. The Grant will finance
            the rehabilitation of tertiary rural access infrastructure
            and technical assistance to the Government for implementing
            its NEEP. The project will comprise two components: A)
            labor-based rural access rehabilitation reconstruction
            subprojects; and, B) technical assistance to support the
            Government's overall NEEP. The Project is expected to
            create a minimum of 6,000,000 unskilled labor days of
            employment, and to rehabilitate a minimum of 2000 km of
            rural roads and 2300 m of bridges. The labor-based
            sub-projects are expected to provide high social returns in
            the short run and contribute to economic progress in the
            long-term. The employment generated will reduce income
            vulnerability levels and create infrastructure which will
            improve access to markets and services. By removing access
            bottlenecks, the project will help integrate the village
            economy with the regional and national markets. The
            technical assistance component will lead to better
            allocation of resources, higher productivity and outputs,
            and help mobilize further donor resources for productive
            employment creation. The project builds upon working
            implementation arrangements, but even so its implementation
            is  expected to be difficult. The security situation could
            deteriorate, derailing reconstruction efforts. This is
            outside the scope of the project design. However, the
            project's modular design will allow activities in one
            or more unstable provinces to cease without stopping work in
            provinces where there are no or few security risks. The
            Credit and Grant are expected to be fully disbursed in a 39
            month period.
