iv            2014   The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Preface&#13;
Since the late 1990s access to information and communication technologies&#13;
(ICTs) has seen tremendous growthâ&#128;&#148;driven primarily by the wireless&#13;
technologies and liberalization of telecommunications markets. Mobile&#13;
communications have evolved from simple voice and text services to&#13;
diversified innovative applications and mobile broadband Internet. By the&#13;
end of 2013, there were an estimated 6.8 billion mobile-cellular subscriptions&#13;
globally. The number of individuals using the Internet has risen constantly and&#13;
reached an estimated 2.7 billion while the number of fixed (wired)- broadband&#13;
subscriptions reached almost 700 million at the end of 2013.&#13;
&#13;
The impacts of ICTs cross all sectors. Research has shown that investment&#13;
in information and communication technologies is associated with such&#13;
economic benefits as higher productivity, lower costs, new economic&#13;
opportunities, job creation, innovation, and increased trade. ICTs also help&#13;
provide better services in health and education, and strengthen social&#13;
cohesion.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology 2014&#13;
illustrates the progress of this revolution for 214 economies around the&#13;
world. It provides comparable statistics on the sector for 2005 and 2012&#13;
across a range of indicators, enabling readers to readily compare economies.&#13;
&#13;
This book includes indicators covering the economic and social context, the&#13;
structure of the information and communication technology sector, sector&#13;
efficiency and capacity, and sector performance related to access, usage,&#13;
quality, affordability, trade, and applications. The glossary contains definitions&#13;
of the terms used in the tables.&#13;

&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for 2005 and 2012 or the most recent year unless&#13;
otherwise noted in the table or the glossary.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Growth rates are proportional changes from the previous year unless&#13;
       otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
       economies only.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Figures in italics indicate data for years or periods other than those&#13;
       specified.&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
       ..     indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot&#13;
              be calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
0 or 0.0      indicates zero or small enough that the number would round to&#13;
              zero at the displayed number of decimal places.&#13;
&#13;
       $      indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
Lettered notes on some country tables can be found in the notes on&#13;
page 232.&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank or the ITU. The&#13;
term country (used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political&#13;
independence or official recognition by the World Bank or the ITU but refers&#13;
to any economy for which the authorities report separate social or economic&#13;
statistics.&#13;
&#13;
Aggregates for groups of economies are based on the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s regional&#13;
and income classifications. Because of missing data, aggregates should&#13;
be treated as approximations of unknown totals or average values. The&#13;
aggregation method for each indicator is noted in the glossary. Sums (s)&#13;
are simple totals of available data. Weighted averages (w) are calculated&#13;
using the value of the denominator or, in some cases, another indicator as&#13;
the weight. Median (m) calculations are based on available data and exclude&#13;
economies with populations below 1 million. For more information about&#13;
aggregation methods visit datahelpdesk.worldbank.org.&#13;
&#13;
The cutoff date for data is March 1, 2014.&#13;

The country composition of regions is based on the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s analytical&#13;
regions and may differ from common geographic usage. These regions include&#13;
low- and middle-income economies only.&#13;

&amp;#12;                     Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy in The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology&#13;
is classified as low income, middle income, or high income. Low- and middle-&#13;
income economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The&#13;
use of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in&#13;
the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have&#13;
reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income&#13;
does not necessarily reflect development status. Note: Classifications are&#13;
fixed during the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal year (ending on June 30), thus countries&#13;
remain in the categories in which they are classified irrespective of any&#13;
revisions to their per capita income data.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,035 or less&#13;
in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$1,035 but less than $12,616. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle&#13;
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $4,085.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,616 or more.&#13;
&#13;

broadband sub-basket is based on a monthly usage of (a minimum of)&#13;
1Â gigabyte (GB). For plans that limit the monthly amount of data transferred&#13;
by including caps below 1 gigabyte, the cost for additional bytes is added&#13;
to the sub-basket. The minimum speed of a broadband connection is&#13;
256Â kbit/s. (International Telecommunication Union) (m)&#13;
&#13;
Fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions refers to subscriptions to high-speed&#13;
access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds&#13;
equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-&#13;
to-the-home/building, and other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions. This&#13;
total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscrip-&#13;
tions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via&#13;
mobile-cellular networks. It excludes technologies listed under the wireless-&#13;
broadband category. (International Telecommunication Union) (w)&#13;
&#13;
Fixed-telephone sub-basket refers to the monthly price charged for&#13;
subscribing to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), plus the cost&#13;
of 30 local calls to the same (fixed) network (15 peak and 15 off-peak calls)&#13;
of three minutes each. The service refers to the traditional fixed telephone&#13;
line and does not refer to, for example, prices for managed VoIP. (International&#13;
Telecommunication Union) (m)&#13;
&#13;
Fixed-telephone subscriptions refers to the sum of active number of analog&#13;
fixed-telephone lines, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) subscriptions, fixed&#13;

&#13;
GDP growth is the annual percentage growth rate of gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are&#13;
based on constant 2005 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added by&#13;
all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any&#13;
subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without&#13;

GNI per capita, World Bank Atlas method, is gross national income (GNI)&#13;
converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method divided by the&#13;
midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident produc-&#13;
ers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of&#13;
output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and&#13;
property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually&#13;
converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across&#13;
economies. The World Bank Atlas method is used to smooth fluctuations in&#13;
prices and exchange rates. It averages the exchange rate for a given year&#13;

            Since the late 1990s access to
            information and communication technologies (ICTs) has seen
            tremendous growth&#151;driven primarily by the wireless
            technologies and liberalization of telecommunications
            markets. Mobile communications have evolved from simple
            voice and text services to diversified innovative
            applications and mobile broadband Internet. By the end of
            2013, there were an estimated 6.8 billion mobile-cellular
            subscriptions globally. The number of individuals using the
            Internet has risen constantly and reached an estimated 2.7
            billion while the number of fixed (wired)- broadband
            subscriptions reached almost 700 million at the end of 2013.
            The Little Data Book on Information and Communication
            Technology 2014 illustrates the progress of this revolution
            for 214 economies around the world. It provides comparable
            statistics on the sector for 2005 and 2012 across a range of
            indicators, enabling readers to readily compare economies.
            This book includes indicators covering the economic and
            social context, the structure of the information and
            communication technology sector, sector efficiency and
            capacity, and sector performance related to access, usage,
            quality, affordability, trade, and applications. The
            glossary contains definitions of the terms used in the tables.
