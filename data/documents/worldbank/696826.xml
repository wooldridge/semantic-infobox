This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission that visited Viet Nam in June-July&#13;
1995. The mission comprised L. Richard Meyers (Task Manager), Bcmhard Liese (Director,&#13;
Health Services). Nguyen Van Minh (Operations Officer, RMV), Claudia von Monbart&#13;
(Economist), S. Subramanian (Disbursement Specialist), Mohindar Virdy (Procurement&#13;
Specialist), Ji An Zhou (Human Resources Specialist) and consultants Ved Kumar&#13;
(Pharmaceuticals and Logistics Specialist) and Mario Taguiwalo (Health Economics). Pamela&#13;
Wright and Orjan Sjoberg joined the mission as consultants to the Government of the Netherlands&#13;
and SIDA, respectively.   Oscar Echeverri, Rama Lakshminarayanan and Nicholas Prescott&#13;
contributed to the preparation of the project in earlier phases. The contributions of the following&#13;
consultants funded under a Japanese Grant for project preparation are also acknowledged: Cyril&#13;
Bowman, Orville Solon and Melvyn Thome. Peer reviewers were Jeffrey Hammer (PRDPE),&#13;
Janet Hohnen (EA2RS) and James Socknat (ASTHR). The report was cleared by Sven Burmester&#13;
(Chief, EA1HR) and Callisto Madavo (Director, EAI).&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
NATIONAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
1.   THE SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Country Background&#13;
1.1          Since the late 1980s, Viet Nam  has undergone a period of successful&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and adjustment to external shocks occasioned&#13;
by the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1992, the economy had fully recovered and growth&#13;
climbed to 8.3 percent. The decade of the 1990s promises to mark Viet Nam's transition to&#13;
sustained and rapid growth. While growth performance and future prospects are good, Viet&#13;
Nam remains a very low-income country with a per capita GDP of less than US$200.&#13;
Encouragement of broadly-based economic growth with policies that absorb and make&#13;
productive use of labor will play an important role in reducing aggregate poverty in Viet Nam.&#13;
However, certain groups--the more disadvantaged and those living in resource poor regions--&#13;
are likely to lag behind. The policy challenge for the 1990s therefore lies in taking advantage&#13;
of Viet Nam's substantial growth potential while at the same time ensuring widespread&#13;
participation in the benefits of development.&#13;
1.2         Broad-based economic growth will generate new and diverse income-earning&#13;
activities for the poor in Viet Nam, but some will be unable to take full advantage of them&#13;
because of illiteracy, lack of skills, ill-health and malnutrition. Ensuring access for the poor to&#13;
basic social services--especially primary education, basic health care and family planning is&#13;
doubly essential. Viet Nam has made impressive progress in providing widespread access to&#13;
basic social services for a country with such a low income level. It has also developed an&#13;
extensive system of social transfers and safety nets. Altogether public spending on these&#13;
programs absorbs around one-third of the Government's discretionary current expenditure.&#13;
But since the late 1980s the quality and quantity of social service provision has shown signs of&#13;
deterioration. Secondary school enrollments have declined sharply and utilization of health&#13;
services has also fallen. These developments have occurred in parallel with major changes in&#13;
the provision and financing of social services as part of Viet Nam's ambitious program of&#13;
structural reform.&#13;
B. The Population, Health and Nutrition Sector&#13;
1.3         Past Achievements.   Viet Nam's past record on health and fertility&#13;
improvements has been impressive and matched by few low-income countries. For example,&#13;
the infant mortality rate (IMIR) was roughly halved from about 156 per 1,000 live births in&#13;
1960 to around 83 in 1979 and was then approximately halved again during the next ten years.&#13;
The total fertility rate, which was 5.1 children in 1979, fell by over 25% between 1979 and&#13;
1989. A number of factors jointly contributed to the health gains achieved by Viet Nam:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
establishment of a vast network of primary health facilities throughout the country;&#13;
implementation of a number of categorical health programs to deal with preventable health&#13;
problems, such as malaria, diarrheal diseases, and immunizable diseases; and high rates of&#13;
literacy, especially among women. A strong past political commitment to health resulted in a&#13;
substantial allocation of resources to the sector.&#13;
1.4           Recent Declines. Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, a number of problems&#13;
arose. Among these were the burden of improving the poor health infrastructure in the South&#13;
after reunification, sharply diminished external assistance to the sector, acute macroeconomic&#13;
instability and a deepening fiscal crisis in the mid-1980s. The political imperative traditionally&#13;
accorded to the sector also began to ebb somewhat. Under these circumstances, inputs to the&#13;
sector--drugs, equipment, medical supplies, maintenance--began declining. A well-functioning&#13;
health service system has therefore been breaking down. At the same time, the sector has had&#13;
to address a set of new challenges entailed by the transition to the market economy.&#13;
1.5           As a result of these developments past gains in health are threatened. Some&#13;
health indictors have shown signs of reversal. There has been a major resurgence of malaria in&#13;
the mountainous regions and areas bordering Cambodia. Malnutrition rates in Viet Nam are&#13;
significantly higher than would be expected, rates higher than any other low-income country in&#13;
South and Southeast Asia, except Bangladesh and possibly Myanmar. There is also evidence&#13;
that the health gains of the past have been unevenly distributed. There are wide disparities in&#13;
health, population and nutrition indicators across regions and provinces and between urban&#13;
and rural areas.&#13;
2&#13;
Organization of the Health System&#13;
1.6           Central Level. Health services in Viet Nam are organized along a four-tiered&#13;
system. At the apex is the Ministry of Health, which is the main authority in the health&#13;
sector. It provides overall policy guidance and technical direction for the country. It is&#13;
organized into 13 functional departments. In addition, it has specialized institutes which&#13;
provide services of a tertiary nature and referral services in various specialties.  These&#13;
institutes include the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the National Institute&#13;
of Nutrition, and a number of other institutes responsible for research, training, and patient&#13;
care in areas such as traditional medicine, pediatrics, tuberculosis, etc. In addition, there are a&#13;
number of other ministries that provide parallel health services, such as the Ministry of&#13;
Defense. Overall there are some 33 service-providing institutions at the central level under&#13;
the MOH. It is widely recognized that there is a need to streamline the overall management of&#13;
central health services.&#13;
Viet Nam has achieved a density of service provision at all levels--including hospitals and health centers--&#13;
that far exceeds availability in most developing countries. For example, Viet Nam's ratio of commune&#13;
health centers per million population is around 170, compared with 32 in Indonesia, 63 in China and 141&#13;
in Thailand. Similarly, Vietnam's hospital bed ratio of one per 389 persons compares favorably with one&#13;
per 465 in China, 665 in Thailand and 1,743 in Indonesia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
1.7           As in many other centrally planned economies, over the years Viet Nam has&#13;
developed a number of self-contained vertical health programs, including that for malaria,&#13;
tuberculosis (TB), acute respiratory infections (ARI) control and control of diarrheal diseases&#13;
(CDD), with structures running down to the central district level. In general, the complex&#13;
structure at the central level results in unclear and overlapping institutional mandates. As&#13;
such, it is now proving inefficient in a market economy where coordination and integration&#13;
would permit greater efficiency.&#13;
1.8           Provincial Level. The provincial level is administered by the Provincial Health&#13;
Services. The Director of the Provincial Health Service oversees health activities in the&#13;
province. There is also a Center for Preventative Medicine, which manages the cold chain for&#13;
vaccine storage, provides support to the districts to perform preventative services and&#13;
maintains a range of laboratory referral services. The provinces also run provincial hospitals&#13;
and in some cases specialized hospitals. These general hospitals have facilities for care in&#13;
specialties such as surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, internal medicine, etc. Altogether there are&#13;
some 249 provincial general and specialist hospitals. Manpower at the provincial level totals&#13;
approximately 35% of the nation's total. However, in practice most of the patients cared for&#13;
at these hospitals reside in the general vicinity of the hospitals. The hospitals therefore serve&#13;
many basic curative needs that for the most part could be effectively attended to at lower&#13;
levels in the health care delivery system.&#13;
1.9           An additional function of  provincial health services is provided by the&#13;
secondary medical school.  These schools train middle level health workers for their&#13;
provinces--assistant physicians, nurses, midwives, and secondary pharmacists.&#13;
1.10          District Level. District Health Services have three components. The District&#13;
Health Office has surveillance and program management responsibilities. The Preventative&#13;
Medicine Service provides preventative services, including EPI, CDD, malaria control,&#13;
Vitamin A deficiency control, and iodine deficiency control. It also provides support to the&#13;
commune health centers to deliver these services. The District Hospital is staffed by general&#13;
practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists, pediatricians, opthamologists, dentists and in some&#13;
cases ear, nose and throat specialists. The District Health Office and District Hospital have&#13;
recently been combined into the District Health Center (DHC).&#13;
1.11          There are some 550 district hospitals in the country, one in each district. Most&#13;
have excess bed capacity, with occupancy rates averaging only 50%.&#13;
1.12          The support that DHCs provide to lower level health services varies in quantity&#13;
and quality. Since most health resources of the district reside in the DHCs, there is a need to&#13;
improve the quality of services and focus the range of services at this level to improve the&#13;
effectiveness of these facilities as a first referral facility.&#13;
1.13          Under the DHC is a hybrid facility, the Intercommunal Poly-clinic (ICP), that&#13;
in theory is to serve some three to six communes. ICPs were intended to provide basic&#13;
services at a higher level of sophistication than commune health centers (CHCs), the lowest&#13;
level facilities. ICPs were to take referrals and give other back-up services and training to&#13;
CHCs. In practice most have not fulfilled these roles and the Government is re-examining&#13;
their future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.14         Commune Level. Commune Health Centers (CHCs) are the unit of service&#13;
delivery at the commune level.  There is a wide network of CHCs and some 93%  of&#13;
communes have CHCs. The remaining communes, "white communes," are to be provided&#13;
with CHCs over the next three years. CHCs employ some 23% of all health workers. In&#13;
theory, each CHC is staffed by 3-5 CHC workers, comprised of at least one assistant doctor&#13;
trained for three years and a nurse midwife trained for two years. In practice this is often not&#13;
the case. The major reason for this stems from the collapse of the now largely defunct rural&#13;
cooperatives that used to fund the operation of CHCs and, most importantly, staff salaries.&#13;
This loss of revenue, combined with the pressures on public health expenditures since the late&#13;
1980s, have resulted in the deterioration of equipment and facilities, leading to facilities that&#13;
are often run down and lacking in the most basic equipment and drugs. Many CHC workers&#13;
are said to be working only a few hours a day in order to supplement their salaries through&#13;
other means. In recognition of this dilemma, Government decided in 1994 to phase in the&#13;
financing of CHC staff salaries by the state health budget over a three year period.&#13;
1.15         Each commune consists of hamlets and villages. A previously existing health&#13;
worker, the brigade nurse, provided health care for local people prior to 1986. However, with&#13;
the dismantling of production brigades, this household level outreach system largely&#13;
disappeared.&#13;
1.16         Supervision. Given the tiered nature of the health system described above,&#13;
supervision is meant to take place from the central to provincial level, from provincial to the&#13;
district level, etc. Two major constraints largely prevent this. One is lack of resources--&#13;
transportation, travel allowances, etc. The other is lack of good training in proper supervision&#13;
procedures. Most supervision does not examine the quality of care, facilities, record keeping&#13;
etc., nor are workers advised, commended or reprimanded as appropriate.&#13;
1.17         Private Health Care. Doctors have been allowed to practice privately since&#13;
1989, either using public facilities after hours or, increasingly, out of their own homes or in&#13;
small privately-owned clinics. An important group of private practitioners is retired health&#13;
workers who have elected to take up private practice. While the extent of private practice is&#13;
increasing, there are no reliable estimates of the numbers involved, especially for rural areas.&#13;
This is compounded by the lack of clear official distinctions regarding what is considered&#13;
private and what is public. The lack of adequate regulations governing private practice,&#13;
which can ensure that medical standards are set and enforced, is of concern to the&#13;
Government. It also inhibits those physicians who wish to expand their private practice but&#13;
are unsure of what the rules are that might impact on this expansion.&#13;
1.18         The private sector is most visible in private pharmacies, whose numbers have&#13;
increased dramatically since 1989. As noted in Section C below, private sales of drugs&#13;
account for the bulk of household payments for medical care.&#13;
Human Resource Constraints&#13;
1.19         While, as noted above, Viet Nam has high health worker per capita ratios&#13;
relative to many other low-income countries, CHC workers constitute only about 23% of the&#13;
total health work force. This percentage is less than optimal given that an overwhelming&#13;
majority of the health problems are still infectious and parasitic diseases that could be tackled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
at the CHC level. Because of their wider availability and better distribution, people are more&#13;
likely to consult CHCs than any other level of public care. Thus, the need for ensuring that&#13;
CHCs are staffed with well-trained and highly motivated staff. A particular need is in the area&#13;
of maternal care, especially trained midwives. Most assistant physicians are male. Women are&#13;
more likely to seek help from female health workers, especially for ante-natal examinations&#13;
and delivery. Of the total workers in the sector, only about 14,000 are secondary or&#13;
elementary midwives.  These numbers are not adequate for the estimated 18.5 million&#13;
Vietnamese women of childbearing age.&#13;
1.20         Training. Training is carried out in eight medical and pharmaceutical schools,&#13;
plus 25 secondary schools. The eight medical schools produce some 2,000 graduates each&#13;
year. About two-thirds of all doctors are trained at Hanoi Medical School, the oldest and&#13;
most prestigious in the country. Quantity of training, at least at the physician level, is less of&#13;
an issue than is quality and orientation. Community diagnosis and management of health&#13;
services receive only minimal attention. Epidemiological approaches to addressing health&#13;
problems in a community are needed in all health training programs.&#13;
1.21         Secondary medical schools, which train middle level health workers, are in&#13;
need of improvements in both facilities and curriculum. The training is mainly didactic and&#13;
for the most part does not incorporate modem client-centered, interactive methods, that are&#13;
skills-based, problem-oriented (as opposed to focusing on topics or programs), locally-&#13;
adapted and experience-tested.&#13;
Information Needs&#13;
1.22         A major impediment to more rational planning for progress in the sector is the&#13;
lack of reliable information on a range of issues. Most sources of data do not agree on the&#13;
magnitude of health problems and status. Thus, there are often significant differences between&#13;
data sources (e.g., MOH, census data, the Demographic and Health Survey) on such statistics&#13;
as the IMR. There is usually no disaggregated data to indicate the size of problems for each&#13;
disease within the general population statistics. In addition, there is a lack of accurate,&#13;
population based information essential for policy decisions that need to be made in order to&#13;
rapidly reorient the sector towards more market economy approaches.   For example,&#13;
Government lacks information on price, accessibility and quality of the available public and&#13;
private medical care. It does not have reliable figures on health care utilization, particularly as&#13;
this relates to socio-economic status. Without such information, it will be difficult to devise&#13;
effective market oriented policies that can move the sector forward but that can also respond&#13;
to the Government's traditional concern with equity.&#13;
Current Health and Nutrition Status&#13;
1.23         Viet Nam has a relatively low average infant mortality rate (around 46 per&#13;
1,000 live births in 1991) and high average life expectancy (67). Major causes of child&#13;
3&#13;
A description of the population subsector is found in Staff Appraisal Report 14966 VN, which&#13;
describes IDA's Population and Family Health Project, a companion project to the National&#13;
Health Support Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
mortality include malaria, ARI, diarrheal disease, neonatal tetanus and measles. It is estimated&#13;
that ARI (33%) and diarrhea (25%) account for over half of all infant deaths. Under-five&#13;
mortality is estimated to be about 81/1,000 live births (1991), reflecting the same disease&#13;
conditions as infants.&#13;
1.24         Estimates of the maternal mortality rate (MiMiR) vary greatly across the&#13;
country, averaging around 110 but rising as high as over 400 per 100,00 live births (1991).&#13;
The conditions of delivery are a major determinant of the condition of maternal and the&#13;
newborn's health. While reliable data on maternal health services are lacking, even the MOH&#13;
data indicate a declining trend in the number of women delivering at health facilities. MOH&#13;
considers that 35% of all maternal deaths are definitely preventable and 53% are possibly&#13;
preventable. The avoidable factors most often include delay in treatment, delay in referral,&#13;
delay in diagnosis, incorrect treatment or diagnosis and lack of transport, blood or drugs.&#13;
1.25         Viet Nam has embarked on a plan to achieve important primary health care&#13;
goals in five areas by the year 2,000: 85% UCI coverage; polio eradication; neonatal tetanus&#13;
elimination; reduction of measles morbidity by 90% and mortality by 95%; and 85% of all&#13;
diarrhea episodes to receive oral rehydration therapy plus continued feeding.  Substantial&#13;
progress has been made in meeting each of these targets with neonatal tetanus elimination&#13;
being the least successful in large part due to the lack of access to good maternal health care&#13;
during pregnancy and delivery at CHCs.&#13;
1.26         Despite the progress cited above, relative to other developing countries, Viet&#13;
Nam still resembles a typical low-income country in its disease profile, with preventable&#13;
communicable diseases being the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, among adults and&#13;
children. Malaria, followed by diarrhea and respiratory infections account for the majority of&#13;
reported illnesses, while tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI)&#13;
are the leading causes of mortality.&#13;
1.27         Malaria has had a resurgence in recent years with the number of deaths&#13;
reaching 4,646 in 1991, the highest ever recorded. This worsening of the situation was&#13;
primarily due to the under-financing of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and&#13;
was compounded by the changing epidemiological situation, serious problems of resistance to&#13;
drugs and decline in general health services. Although mortality has been steadily reduced in&#13;
the past two years, the risk of malaria continues to be a fundamental threat for about 35&#13;
million Vietnamese.&#13;
1.28         Tuberculosis is a less dramatic and visible disease in Viet Nam, though it is the&#13;
second major public health problem following malaria. Annually, more than 50,000 new&#13;
infectious cases occur, most of whom would die without proper treatment. Moreover, these&#13;
patients infect annually more than one million Vietnamese citizens. With systematic treatment&#13;
it is now not only possible to prevent the mortality caused by tuberculosis but also, and most&#13;
importantly, to reduce transmission of the disease. This would result in fewer new cases per&#13;
year, and such a gain in tuberculosis control is long-term.&#13;
1.29         HIV/AIDS is an increasing health concem in Viet Nam. As of November&#13;
1994, nearly 2,000 HIV infected persons had been reported since the first reported case in&#13;
1991. Altogether 22 provinces have reported HIV, with a concentration in provinces in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
South. Using different scenarios projected annual AIDS cases by the year 2,000 range from&#13;
4,000 to 11,000. Government established the National AIDS Committee (NAC) in 1990 with&#13;
representation from ten ministries and four mass organizations. It is currently chaired by a&#13;
Vice Prime Minister. Provincially there is replication of the NAC. UNDP has taken the lead&#13;
in an effort to coordinate external assistance for the Government's efforts. Discussions are&#13;
ongoing within the Government concerning an appropriate strategy for addressing the&#13;
HIV/AIDS threat as well as how best to mobilize and coordinate external assistance.&#13;
1.30        As noted above, Viet Nam's child malnutrition rates are extremely high.&#13;
Estimates of the prevalence of underheight for age (stunting) of children under five years are&#13;
49%; for underweight for height (wasting) 12%. The 1992-93 Viet Nam Standards Survey&#13;
(VLSS) found that for children aged 1-2, when the impact of malnutrition has its most serious&#13;
long-term consequences, one in ten children are wasted. Similarly, around three of every five&#13;
Vietnamese children in that vulnerable age group are already stunted. Low birth weights, an&#13;
outcome of intrauterine malnutrition, showed figures for 1990 and 1992 of 12% and 14%,&#13;
respectively. While inconclusive, there is some evidence to suggest that these rates have been&#13;
increasing. A 1993 nationwide MOH study of 3,062 children aged 8 to 12 from 30 schools in&#13;
provinces throughout the country indicated that 16% have severe iodine deficiency disorders;&#13;
65% have mild or moderate disorders. Anemia linked to iron deficiency is a major problem.&#13;
It is estimated that approximately half of all pregnant women are anemic. In rural areas, about&#13;
half of young children are anemic.&#13;
C. The Changing Health Sector--Sector Issues&#13;
1.31        Perhaps the greatest overall challenge facing the sector is how to respond to&#13;
current rapid change. On the one hand it confronts the problem of a relatively recent and&#13;
rapid demise in what was once a strong public health system. On the other is the challenge of&#13;
how to take advantage of the opportunities that the new market economy context offers.&#13;
1.32        Decline in the Quality of Service. The developments described earlier have led&#13;
to significant undermining of the past quality of health services. Medical and surgical&#13;
equipment in district hospitals is sparse, antiquated and barely functional in many cases. A&#13;
large proportion of commune health facilities have become dilapidated to the point of being&#13;
unusable for want of equipment and medical supplies. A significant proportion of commune&#13;
health centers have virtually no drugs or injections to dispense. Many commune level staff&#13;
have had no retraining over the last decade or two, or at most only a few days. At the same&#13;
time salaries of health personnel have declined in real terms leading to low morale and&#13;
productivity.&#13;
1.33        Changing Patterns of Health Service Utilization. The symptoms of decline in&#13;
health services are seen in a marked reduction in the utilization of health services. According&#13;
to Ministry of Health (MOH) service statistics, the number of outpatient consultations has&#13;
fallen in half since the late 1980s, from an annual rate of around 2.1 visits per capita in 1987 to&#13;
0.9 per capita in 1993. The inpatient admission rate also dropped sharply during this period,&#13;
falling from about 105 per 1,000 persons in 1987 to 68 per 1,000 in 1990; since then inpatient&#13;
utilization appears to have recovered but not to its former level. While the reliability of these&#13;
reported trends is in some doubt, given weaknesses in the official reporting system and its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
inability to capture utilization of private sector services, they certainly suggest a picture of&#13;
reversal in Viet Nam's past gains in delivering health services.&#13;
1.34         The Challenges of Liberalization. In March and April of 1989, the Council of&#13;
Ministers promulgated a series of measures designed to liberalize the health sector and&#13;
mobilize new resources for the sector. These included: (a) introduction of user fees for&#13;
health care; (b) legalization of private practice; and (c) sale of drugs on the open market as&#13;
well as liberalization of the pharmaceutical industry.  Each of these developments has&#13;
presented its own challenges.&#13;
1.35         (a) User Fees.  While eager to relieve the public budget from  financing&#13;
pressures for health care, the Government is concerned about the impact of private financing&#13;
on the poor. Pricing regulations governing services rendered by public health facilities have&#13;
recently been updated with clearer guidelines on protecting access to the poor. But the actual&#13;
enforcement of these guidelines, their impact on revenues and access by the poor and their&#13;
future adjustments are still serious concerns.&#13;
1.36         (b) Privatization. Drug retailing and private professional practice have been&#13;
liberalized in order to harness private sector capacities. Private sector prices and quality are&#13;
of concern to policy makers; there is a belief that the private sector can do more in health but&#13;
policy makers are unsure how to best delineate public-private roles. That this is an important&#13;
area of concern is demonstrated by the fact that expenditures by the private sector are by far&#13;
the largest source of financing for health care. Estimates from the VLSS indicate that total&#13;
household payments for medical care amounted to some 7,500 billion dong in 1993. Around&#13;
3,000 billion dong was spent on medical care contacts in which treatment was provided by the&#13;
public sector--twice as much as the total amount of public subsidies for health. Only a small&#13;
proportion of this amount was spent on payment of fees to public providers. Rather, most of&#13;
it--2,800 billion dong--paid for drugs associated with, but often not provided as part of,&#13;
treatment in public facilities; the state budget allocates only about 60 billion dong for drugs&#13;
which are intended to be provided free of charge. Even more--4,300 billion dong--was spent&#13;
on drugs by people who sought treatment from private providers or who resorted to self-&#13;
medication. These figures suggest that drug utilization dominates health expenditure in Viet&#13;
Nam, yet the public sector plays little direct role in providing or financing it.&#13;
1.37         Taking the public and private sectors together, it is clear that the public sector&#13;
role in financing health care overall is small--the state budget paid for 16 percent of all health&#13;
expenditures in 1993. Even for important public services, private payment dominates. Thus,&#13;
public subsidies contribute only one-third of all spending associated with public hospitals, and&#13;
less than 10 percent of all spending associated with utilization of commune health centers.&#13;
These estimates show that the financing reforms introduced in 1989 have had a far-reaching&#13;
effect, transforming the provision of health care into a largely private market. This transition&#13;
presents both an opportunity and a threat to the poor. On the one hand, successful&#13;
mobilization of private resources has enabled a much higher level of access to health care to&#13;
be sustained than would have been possible with continued reliance on the severely&#13;
constrained level of budgetary financing. On the other hand, the complementary role of the&#13;
public sector remains thinly spread across all levels of curative and preventive health care,&#13;
rather than narrowly targeted at priority areas of government involvement. This means that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
the poor face lower quality and higher prices for basic health care at public facilities than they&#13;
would if public resources were better targeted.&#13;
1.38         c) Pharmaceutical Sector. Prior to economic liberalization, the pharmaceutical&#13;
sector was tightly controlled to serve the well defined needs of the socialized health service&#13;
delivery system. However, with opening of the economy, there has been rapid growth in the&#13;
number of entities importing and distributing drugs in both the public and private sector. As&#13;
indicated in the sectoral analysis above, self-medication without medical consultation is now&#13;
the norm. The previous system of oversight was not set up to handle the current massive&#13;
influx of drugs and the situation is now largely out of the authorities' control. Given the&#13;
potential detrimental health impacts of this situation, including already documented cases of&#13;
increased drug resistance, there is an urgent need for the formulation and effective&#13;
implementation of a national drug policy.  SIDA is providing resources to support the&#13;
Government's effort in this area. IDA must seek to ensure that its investments in the sector&#13;
complement and further progress in this important endeavor.&#13;
4&#13;
1.39         Public Expenditures for Health.  A notable feature of the fiscal adjustment of&#13;
1990-91 was that social sector spending was protected relative to other sectors.  These&#13;
increases offset the compression in overall government spending so that real expenditures per&#13;
capita actually increased. However, the impact of public expenditures depends not only on&#13;
how much is spent but also where it is spent--to what extent are these expenditures directed to&#13;
those regions and provinces with large concentrations of poverty?--and how well it is spent--&#13;
to what extent are policies implemented so that the benefits accrue to the intended groups?&#13;
1.40         These considerations are particularly important when considering their impact&#13;
on the poor. State budget expenditures for health are distributed between the central and local&#13;
governments in line with their administrative functions. The central government budget for&#13;
health subsidizes central and branch hospitals, which are administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Health and other ministries respectively, together with preventive health care, medical training&#13;
and research. Local government budgets subsidize lower levels of health care, with provincial&#13;
governments responsible for provincial hospitals and the district level subsidizing district&#13;
hospitals and, in some cases, commune health centers. Thus the central budget finances&#13;
around one-quarter of the state budget for health, while the rest is spent by the local&#13;
governments. Overall state budget expenditures on health in 1993 amounted to 1,442 billion&#13;
dong, or some 20 thousand dong per capita--about half as much as the government spent on&#13;
education. No official breakdowns of budgetary expenditure are available for local&#13;
governments but estimates, based on analysis carried out for Viet Nam: Poverty Strategy and&#13;
Assessment, suggest that almost all of this budget--90 percent--is spent on curative care in&#13;
hospitals. Only a small amount, about 3 percent, is reported to be spent on preventive health&#13;
care. An even smaller amount of the budget, 2 percent, is estimated to be spent on commune&#13;
health centers.&#13;
1.41         Reaching the poor effectively means giving priority in allocating public&#13;
resources to those health programs which the poor are more likely to use extensively.&#13;
4&#13;
These issues are elaborated in detail in Viet Nam: Poverty Strategy and Assessment, World Bank, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Targeting public expenditures efficiently requires that the poor also use a large fraction of the&#13;
subsidized health programs. Analysis based on VLSS data indicates that, aggregating across&#13;
all health sector programs, health subsidies are larger for the better off, reaching 28 thousand&#13;
dong per capita for the richest quintile or more than double the amount spent on the poor,&#13;
which averaged 11 thousand dong. In other words public subsidies for health reach the poor&#13;
less effectively than they benefit the better off This reflects the fact that most of the budget is&#13;
allocated to public programs--hospitals--which are not efficiently targeted to the poor. Only&#13;
the very small budgetary subsidy for commune health centers is strongly pro-poor.&#13;
1.42         There is a need to achieve greater consistency between the Government's&#13;
formal policies to increase the quality of health care for the poor and the actual allocation of&#13;
public health expenditures. Systematic analysis of the current public expenditure system for&#13;
health will be essential to this effort.&#13;
1.43         Donor Coordination.   External assistance for health has been steadily&#13;
increasing since the early 1 990s. MOH figures show a total of approximately US$36 million&#13;
for 1994 divided between United Nations agencies (32%); NGOs (12%); and ODA (56%).&#13;
SIDA, active since the beginning of the 1970s, has been the largest donor, followed by&#13;
UNICEF.  An increasing number of bi-lateral donors are providing funding for a range of&#13;
MOH programs such as the malaria control program, upgrading of health infrastructure in&#13;
selected districts/provinces, etc. However, the MOH has yet to develop an overall framework&#13;
for rationalizing the use of these new  resources and maximizing their impact.  As a&#13;
consequence, individual donor interests rather than the Ministry's well articulated priorities&#13;
play a major role in determining where and how external assistance is utilized. Nor is use of&#13;
these resources tracked in a systematic way to provide a clear picture of their allocation by&#13;
geographic area, program or function, types of inputs financed, etc. Thus, there is a real need&#13;
for development of a sound public investment plan based on the MOH's policy objectives that&#13;
could be used as a basis for mobilizing and coordinating donor resources.&#13;
D. Priority Actions for the Health Sector&#13;
1.44         The above description of the changing character of the sector suggests that&#13;
there are number of actions that need to be taken if the quality of health care is to improve,&#13;
particularly for the poorer segments of Vietnamese society:&#13;
1.45          (i) Revitalization of the Public Health Network. The revitalization and further&#13;
extension of grass roots health coverage is essential if the Government is to assure a basic&#13;
service outreach capacity for preventive, promotive and early treatment programs. Given&#13;
current trends, without Government intervention the commune health centers will turn to fee&#13;
for service arrangements in communes with some capacity to pay or wither away in&#13;
communes that are unable to generate enough revenues. In any case, the basic infrastructure&#13;
for delivering publicly funded programs like tuberculosis control, immunization, health&#13;
education, family planning, nutritional supplementation, disease surveillance, epidemic control,&#13;
and other community health services that are not amenable to fee for service arrangements&#13;
could be greatly weakened. As noted in the World Development Report 1993: Investing in&#13;
Health, these are among the most cost-effective interventions that governments with limited&#13;
resources can support. For example, global estimates suggest that in low-income countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis costs US$3-5 per disability-adjusted life year&#13;
(DALY) saved, making this one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Thus,&#13;
there is a need to secure an essential infrastructure for delivering cost-effective, public health&#13;
services with large collective benefits in which market mechanisms are known to fail. This is&#13;
distinguished from health care that benefits primarily individuals for which markets work more&#13;
effectively.&#13;
1.46         It is important to emphasize that the above effort should not be one that seeks&#13;
to restore the commune health system to its former status as an all-purpose health service unit.&#13;
CHCs as an integrated preventative, promotive, curative and supervisory facility may have&#13;
been appropriate during the socialized system. However, conditions have greatly changed.&#13;
Communes are no longer an organized production unit generating lots of collective resources.&#13;
Moreover, there are changes in the demand for health care services. People are seeking&#13;
higher quality care, or at least perceived higher quality care, and thus some are going to&#13;
private practitioners, drugstores or directly to hospitals. Thus, CHCs need to emphasize as&#13;
their primary role the provision of preventative, promotive and community health services that&#13;
people may not be willing or able to pay for but that Government wants to assure.&#13;
1.47         (ii) Support for National Communicable Disease Control Programs. Within&#13;
the general area of improving public health services, there is a particular need to focus scarce&#13;
public resources on the control of malaria, tuberculosis and acute respiratory infections, which&#13;
are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. Together these diseases pose a&#13;
heavy burden on the health of the population and a substantial drain on economic resources.&#13;
Their control, because of its public goods nature, is necessarily in the public domain forming&#13;
an essential part of public health activities. However, support for these national programs&#13;
needs to be closely linked to the strengthening of CHCs, and DHCs, which are the critical&#13;
links in the grass roots health system for achieving communicable disease control program&#13;
success.&#13;
1.48         (iii)  Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Policy Analysis. The analysis&#13;
presented in section C above suggests that Viet Nam's rapid shift to a market economy has&#13;
left the MOH and related Government agencies poorly-equipped to confront the urgent&#13;
planning and policy challenges presented by the new market economy context. While there&#13;
are a number of institutional issues to be addressed--future manpower training, reorganization&#13;
of the public health service, etc.--, two would seem particularly urgent. The first is increased&#13;
capacity to undertake public expenditure analysis. As noted in the sectoral analysis above, the&#13;
Government wishes to substantially improve the way public funds for health are mobilized,&#13;
allocated and used, so as to improve the overall quality and coverage of health services,&#13;
reduce major public health problems and adequately meet the particular health needs of the&#13;
poor. To achieve these aims, it must improve significantly its capacity for public investment&#13;
planning in health in order to know where its resources for health come from, how they are&#13;
allocated, how they are spent, and what outputs are produced.&#13;
1.49         The second major institutional challenge has to do with improving Government&#13;
capacity to mobilize private financing for health. As also noted above, private expenditures&#13;
make up the large bulk of total expenditures for health. Given this, the Government would&#13;
like to mobilize private financing for health as well as private capacities for producing health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
services in ways that: (a) sustain the increases in overall levels of resources made available by&#13;
the growing economy for meeting the health needs of the country; (b) relieve the public&#13;
burden from financing pressures due to increased demand for higher quality personal care by&#13;
those with the means to pay; and (c) achieve some degree of cross-subsidization of the poor&#13;
by the rich in the latteres payments for use of publicly-provided health services. However, the&#13;
MOH needs to increase its capacity to provide advice to the Government on how to achieve&#13;
these objectives.&#13;
1.50         The above three areas for action are arguably the most important ones that&#13;
need to be acted upon to achieve significant progress in the health sector. The project set out&#13;
in Chapter 2 builds on these three areas for its basic design.&#13;
E. Strategy for Sector Development&#13;
1.51         The health sector in Viet Nam today is a blend of overlapping approaches to&#13;
health policy, financing, management and delivery of services. These approaches stem from&#13;
various sources, including socialist principles of equity and predominant state responsibility, a&#13;
market-oriented view of a pluralist health system financed by user contributions, and&#13;
internationally prevalent concepts for improving health care in developing countries such as&#13;
Primary Health Care, Health For All, etc. The 1992 constitution marked a new direction,&#13;
however, by stating that health is no longer guaranteed by the state but is still a basic right,&#13;
reflecting the withdrawal of the state as the sole provider of health care. It commits the&#13;
Government to certain basic health programs but also accepts alternative contributions to&#13;
health care.&#13;
1.52         The current MOH formal health sector strategy was articulated in its 1992&#13;
"Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000 and Strategic Health Plan for the Period 1990-&#13;
1995 in Vietnam". The strategy emphasizes nine health strategies for the pursuit of health for&#13;
all, e.g., early prevention, comprehensive health care, etc. A number of National Programs&#13;
have been developed to address the priority health problems, e.g., Strengthening the Primary&#13;
Health Care Network, Program for Goiter Control, etc. Each of the national programs is&#13;
centrally administered through a department of the Ministry of Health and some receive major&#13;
funding from a donor, e.g., EPI from UNICEF. While these various programs represent a&#13;
range of important approaches to basic health problems, many of them reflecting donor&#13;
concerns, they do not collectively constitute a fully coherent and consistent approach to the&#13;
problems of the sector. In part this reflects the conflict between an economically-driven&#13;
requirement to reduce health expenditures and a political commitment to maintain or expand&#13;
coverage. As a result, the priorities and support programs are sometimes only partly related&#13;
to the question of financing and affordability.  Sometimes this also leads to selective&#13;
implementation of national programs in donor-funded areas only. The Ministry recognizes&#13;
this lack of consistency in approaches and is seeking, through various mechanisms, to&#13;
formulate a more analytically grounded and consistent overall health sector strategy. The&#13;
strategy is currently being revised. Initial draft formulations of this strategy emphasize, among&#13;
other things, the importance of diversifying the provision of health care by encouraging an&#13;
increased role for the private sector, and reiterate the Government's strong commitment to&#13;
achieving improvements in primary health care in the poorer regions of Viet Nam.&#13;

F. Bank Experience&#13;
1.53         Lessons from Previous IDA Experience. IDA has experience with only one&#13;
social sector project in Viet Nam, the Primary Education Project (Cr. 2548-VN). Relatively&#13;
slow initial implementation progress in this project highlights the need for investments in&#13;
helping counterpart agency personnel become fully familiar with IDA procedures such as&#13;
procurement. However, subsequent projects will clearly benefit from the knowledge that is&#13;
now accumulating in the Government about these matters, e.g., formulation of standardized&#13;
bidding documents. One other difficulty has been some resistance on the part of the&#13;
Government to allocate IDA funds for technical assistance. The availability of grant financing&#13;
in the National Health Support Project should help to overcome this difficulty&#13;
1.54         Country Assistance Strategy. IDA's goal in Viet Nam as articulated in the&#13;
CAS, discussed by the Executive Directors on November 21, 1995, is to promote broad-based&#13;
economic development and to combat poverty. The project would contribute especially to the&#13;
latter objective. A key element of IDA's strategy is to assist in the provision of basic social&#13;
services to poor households. The project responds directly to the findings of IDA's Poverty&#13;
Assessment and Strategy Report, in particular that insufficient resources are being directed to&#13;
providing essential public health care in rural areas, especially in poorer provinces, while&#13;
public subsidies for health are primarily going to those most able to afford this care. The&#13;
project is also one means to further IDA's commitment to assist the Government in its&#13;
transition to a market economy by supporting the development of policies that promote cost&#13;
recovery.&#13;
1.55         Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA initially became involved in the sector&#13;
through the production of the Population, Nutrition and Health Sector Report in 1992, which&#13;
set out the first comprehensive description and analysis of the needs of the sector. IDA's first&#13;
operational involvement will provide assistance for addressing the needs of the sector through&#13;
three distinct yet interdependent initiatives. The National Health Support Project (NHSP) will&#13;
improve grass roots health services in fifteen of the poorest provinces, support communicable&#13;
diseases programs nationwide, and strengthen basic planning and policy-formulation capacity&#13;
in MOH. Another proposed IDA-funded Population and Family Health Project will provide&#13;
similar support at the grass roots level in an additional 15 provinces, while also strengthening&#13;
capacity nationwide to foster achievement of population and family health objectives. A third&#13;
proposed Child Nutrition and Development Project would concentrate on reducing Viet&#13;
Nam's strikingly high child malnutrition rates. In addition, these projects will complement the&#13;
IDA-funded Primary Education Project by reinforcing investment in female education through&#13;
investment in women's health.&#13;
1.56         IDA is also increasingly playing a role in providing leadership for donor efforts&#13;
to build institutional capacity in MOH for policy work. The Government has indicated its&#13;
interest in having IDA play a larger role in overall donor coordination in the sector. Given&#13;
IDA's contribution in the area of policy, this should have added value for overall donor&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;

2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Scope&#13;
2.1          Project Objectives: The project's overall objective is to improve the health&#13;
status of the rural population of Viet Nam in the poorer areas of the country. Specifically, it&#13;
would aim to:&#13;
(a)    provide high quality, reliable primary health care on a sustainable basis in&#13;
fifteen of the poorer provinces;&#13;
(b)   reduce nationwide mortality and morbidity due to malaria, tuberculosis and&#13;
acute respiratory infections (diseases that disproportionately afflict the poor),&#13;
as well as the adverse socio-economic impacts associated with these diseases,&#13;
(c)   strengthen the capacity of the MOH  in policy-formulation, planning and&#13;
management in order to better achieve the above objectives, with a particular&#13;
focus on improving the capacity to ensure that the basic health needs of the&#13;
poor are met.&#13;
2.2          Project Scope:  To achieve its objectives, the project would consist of the&#13;
following components:&#13;
(a)    Service Delivery in the areas of  (i) infectious and communicable diseases,&#13;
(ii) maternal and child health care, (iii) family planning, (iv) reproductive health&#13;
services, (v) and other basic health care,&#13;
(b)   National Program  Assistance for the Malaria, Tuberculosis and Acute&#13;
Respiratory Infection Programs, including provision of: (i) drugs, (ii)&#13;
insecticides, (iii) transport and equipment and (iv) technical assistance, in order&#13;
to attain full coverage according to the plans for each national program;&#13;
(c)    Strengthening Institutional Health Planning and Management including support&#13;
for: (i) improving the planning and management of health public expenditures;&#13;
(ii) improving capacity to mobilize private financing for health and private&#13;
capacities for providing health care services; and (iii) generating population-&#13;
based household data and analysis to facilitate more effective and equitable&#13;
health sector planning and management.&#13;
2.3          The project implementation period would extend over seven years from 1996&#13;
to 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
Component 1: Assistance to Commune and District Health Centers&#13;
(US$60. 1 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
2.4          The Government of Viet Nam has identified improvement of the basic health&#13;
services network as one of the priorities for the health sector.  This includes general&#13;
strengthening of the grass roots health network as well as improving essential public health&#13;
services at the primary (commune health center) and first-referral level (district health center)&#13;
facilities.&#13;
2.5          The project's commune and district health center activities and inputs would&#13;
only be made available to the poorest and least developed provinces, districts and communes&#13;
that have not yet received similar kinds and levels of public health investments in the past five&#13;
years. This component would operate in fifteen provinces that were selected on the basis of&#13;
low GNP per capita, low health expenditures per capita, lower than national average health&#13;
status and above average implementation capacity on the part of the provincial health&#13;
authorities. Other factors used to choose the project provinces were availability of Bank and&#13;
other donor assistance (e.g., provinces in the Bank-assisted Population and Family Health&#13;
Project were excluded) and reasonably equitable geographical distribution across the major&#13;
regions of the country. Annex 1 lists the provinces and provides key health indicators for each.&#13;
2.6          The objective at the commune level is to enable the commune health center&#13;
(CHC) to properly perform:&#13;
.  case finding and case management in prevalent infectious and communicable&#13;
diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria;&#13;
*  appropriate quality safe motherhood and child health care including family&#13;
planning;&#13;
*  early first-contact care for common medical problems of the very poor who have&#13;
no means to pay;&#13;
*  IEC activities, epidemiological monitoring, and community mobilization for public&#13;
health promotion.&#13;
2.7          The objective at the district level is to improve district health centers (DHCs)&#13;
primarily as technical support and management command centers for commune level&#13;
public health operations. Thus, they will provide:&#13;
* technically competent field supervision of CHCs;&#13;
* adequate laboratory and other diagnostic facilities to support activities at the&#13;
commune level;&#13;
. first-referral level support in medical, surgical and obstetric services including&#13;
family planning.&#13;
2.8          In addition, the clinical credibility and effectiveness of DHCs would be&#13;
enhanced in terms of improved emergency care capabilities for management of cases common&#13;
in the community, facilities for patient transport, reliable sterile supplies and emergency&#13;
electrical power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
2.9          Inter-communal polyclinics, which are intended to provide intermediate levels&#13;
of care between commune and district health centers, would be treated by the project as either&#13;
commune or district health centers for purposes of providing basic project inputs.  This&#13;
classification will be based on the types of services a facility provides, the skills of the health&#13;
providers, distance from the next level of health care delivery and utilization rates of these&#13;
clinics.&#13;
2.10         In the selected provinces, the project would provide a package of civil works,&#13;
drugs, equipment and retraining to both commune and district health centers as part of a&#13;
public health service infrastructure development strategy of the Ministry of Health. Annex 2&#13;
sets out the overall strategy for supporting the development of this infrastructure.&#13;
Essential Drugs and Supplies&#13;
2.11         The project would provide essential drugs and basic equipment to the&#13;
commune and district health centers to enable them to deliver the above basic health services.&#13;
The list of items to be provided has been stratified to reflect requirements at different levels&#13;
within the health care infrastructure.  Lists of equipment and drugs to be supplied are&#13;
presented in Annex 3. In addition, Annex 4 sets out the guidelines that have been agreed&#13;
upon with the MOH for the financing, procurement and distribution of drugs and equipment.&#13;
The small number of essential drugs to be provided by the project were carefully chosen&#13;
because of their critical role in achieving the project's public health objectives, and are not&#13;
intended to address all, or even a major portion, of the drug needs of the community. They&#13;
are instead intended to primarily address the health needs of pregnant women and children,&#13;
and the poor. The project has been designed so that these drugs are used to benefit the&#13;
population for whom  they are intended.  At negotiations, the Government provided&#13;
assurances that it would furnish to IDA by September 30, 1996, and have an exchange of&#13;
views with IDA on, a comprehensive description of the policy and implementation guidelines&#13;
it will employ to ensure the effective implementation of: (i) cost recovery with respect to the&#13;
essential drugs to be provided by the project in those communes of project provinces where&#13;
applicable;  and (ii) providing essential drugs and medical supplies free of charge in&#13;
mountainous and remote communes in project provinces. The policy and implementation&#13;
guidelines would be reviewed by the Government and IDA each year thereafter and would be&#13;
an explicit focus of the mid-term review. The principles used to designate mountainous and&#13;
remote communes would also be provided. Also, at negotiations, an understanding was&#13;
reached on the specific logistics arrangements for handling project-financed commodities in&#13;
accordance with discussions held during appraisal as set out in Annex 4.&#13;
2.12         Commune level.  Investments in equipment would be focused on basic&#13;
instruments and devices to provide primary health services. The distribution of equipment&#13;
would be done to assure that all CHCs have a minimum standard list. Investment in drugs and&#13;
medical supplies would assure sustained availability of adequate quantities and types needed&#13;
for first contact care of minor cases, maternal and child health care, family planning, treatment&#13;
of trachoma and nutrition and growth monitoring. The actual volume of drugs and supplies&#13;
distributed would reflect the size of the population served by the CHC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
2.13         In addition, two hamlet health workers in communes in remote or mountainous&#13;
areas would be provided with short-term training and a basic medical equipment kit (see&#13;
Annex 3). The workers would report to the CHC and would provide health education and&#13;
rudimentary health services to families in selected hamlets in the commune, especially those&#13;
far from the CHC. This approach would be tested in two provinces in the first two years of&#13;
the project and, if successful, would be revised as necessary and extended to other remote or&#13;
mountainous communes in the project provinces.&#13;
2.14         District level.   Equipment would be provided to  meet the minimum&#13;
requirements for hospital-based clinical support of  implementing various national health&#13;
programs and the incremental requirements for securing a safe and functional hospital&#13;
environment.  The main equipment inputs would be equipment for services in clinical&#13;
laboratories with public health use, diagnostic X-ray, surgical and obstetric equipment,&#13;
equipment for central sterile supplies, emergency electrical power and ambulance transport.&#13;
Investments in drugs would provide those drugs necessary to complement the role of the&#13;
DHC as a first-referral facility for the commune level.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
2.15         The project would upgrade health facilities to enable them to provide good&#13;
quality primary health care.  Different standard models would be used for renovating&#13;
commune and district health centers based on their geographical location and accessibility,&#13;
population size served, utilization rates, distance from a higher-level referral facility and staff&#13;
capacity. A set of decision rules would guide the selection of sites and the nature of civil&#13;
works investments for each facility.  In general these rules operationalize three basic&#13;
principles: a) improve the facilities that are likely to be utilized due to distance from other&#13;
facilities; b) repair these facilities only to a level necessary for their basic functions; and c) only&#13;
when the cost of repairs exceeds 60 percent of the costs of a new facility should replacement&#13;
be considered. These rules are set forth in Annex 5. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
provided assurances that the selection of CHCs and DHCs to be upgraded would be carried&#13;
out in accordance with criteria acceptable to IDA, as described in Annexes 2 and 5.&#13;
Similarly, assurances were provided that the facilities of each commune or district that are&#13;
upgraded would be maintained in accordance with criteria acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.16         Commune health centers.  The project would ensure that CHCs have the&#13;
necessary facilities to serve five purposes: (i) a multi-purpose area for up to ten adults for&#13;
immunization sessions, health education classes, and staff meetings; (ii) an examination area&#13;
for at most two persons; (iii) a minor surgery/delivery/family planning/treatment area for at&#13;
most two persons; (iv) a post-treatment observation/recovery/patient waiting area for at most&#13;
two persons; and (v) a storage area sufficient for CHC stocks of supplies and equipment.&#13;
Electrical connections in electrified areas and a source of safe water would also be assured.&#13;
Two basic models would be supported. Model I facilities, not to exceed 70 sq. meters, would&#13;
serve as basic outpatient clinics. Model 2 facilities, not to exceed 95 sq. meters, would serve&#13;
as outpatient clinics with additional space for limited inpatient services.&#13;
2.17         District health centers. Investments in equipment would be the main rationale&#13;
for investments in civil works, i.e., civil works would be provided only up to the level and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
extent required to properly accommodate and adequately operate the equipment provided. In&#13;
most cases, only those renovations required for surgical and obstetric, laboratory, radiology,&#13;
central sterile, and emergency power rooms would be supported as well as an ambulance&#13;
garage.&#13;
2.18         The number of commune health centers and district health centers eligible for&#13;
improvements under the project is 2,819 and 155, respectively.&#13;
In-service Training of Health Personnel&#13;
2.19         The project would provide training to ensure that health personnel are&#13;
competent to provide health services appropriate to different health care levels. Retraining&#13;
would be provided to staff at all CHCs and DHCs in the selected provinces. In-service&#13;
training would be conducted in five modules that would be developed and pre-tested at the&#13;
central level (see Annex 6). The first two modules would be designed specifically for CHC&#13;
staff and the latter three would address the training needs of district level staff.&#13;
2.20         Commune level.  In-service training would be provided to appropriate,&#13;
regularly salaried workers of all CHCs in the selected provinces. The training would be based&#13;
on two basic modules designed specifically for these workers. Module 1 would cover&#13;
Maternal and Neonatal Care and Family Planning. Module 2 would cover Endemic Disease&#13;
Control.  The modules would be designed to incorporate technical protocols for new&#13;
interventions that are introduced under the project (e.g., injectables, implants, etc.). The&#13;
training activities would be timed to take place during the distribution of the equipment and&#13;
drugs provided by the project.&#13;
2.21         District level. In-service training would be provided to appropriate staff of all&#13;
DHCs. The training would be conducted in three modules. Module 3 would be for training in&#13;
equipment operation and maintenance and would cover four areas--radiology, laboratory&#13;
technology, sterile supplies and operating theater management. Module 4 would train district&#13;
level staff in providing technical and managerial supervision of commune level operations.&#13;
Module 5 would train district health managers and department heads in the management of&#13;
hospital operations and district health center operations.&#13;
2.22         Training of CHC staff would take place at provincial secondary medical&#13;
schools. Central schools such as the School of Public Heath would be used as the sites for&#13;
district level training. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that an&#13;
action plan for this, and other training programs of the project, would be provided to IDA&#13;
for review and comments by June 30, 1996.&#13;
Component 2: Assistance to Three Priority National Programs&#13;
(US$51.4 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
2.23        The project would support three priority national health programs, namely,&#13;
Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB) and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), the policies and general&#13;
operations of which are technically sound. These three diseases have been selected by the&#13;
Government because communicable and infectious diseases still pose an intolerable burden on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
the health of the population and a substantial drain on economic resources. Furthermore, their&#13;
control is clearly in the public domain because of the public goods nature of such control. The&#13;
burden of disease falls disproportionately on the poor. Lastly, they have been selected because&#13;
cost-effective measures are available to address these diseases.&#13;
2.24         The project would provide funding where current available resources are in&#13;
varying degrees short of what are needed to meet assigned national targets. Since project&#13;
assistance would cover the estimated total resource gaps in these programs, the geographic&#13;
coverage of this assistance is effectively nationwide. The component would be implemented&#13;
by the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology and by the National&#13;
Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases through existing organizational channels.&#13;
Annex 7 provides further details concerning the support to be provided to these programs.&#13;
National Malaria Control Program&#13;
2.25         The aims of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) are to: (i) reduce&#13;
deaths due to malaria by early effective treatment, (ii) prevent malaria epidemics or at least&#13;
detect them early and control them; and (iii) apply long-term mosquito control measures to&#13;
reduce the incidence of malaria in populations at high risk. The total projected need for the&#13;
program  in the period 1995-2000 is approximately US$50 million.  The Vietnamese&#13;
Government currently invests about US$4 million per year in the NMCP. Several donors--&#13;
AusAID (Australia), Belgium, GTZ (Germany), Holland (MCNV), UNICEF, WVO and the&#13;
Red Cross--together are expected to provide donations totaling about US$9.3 million for the&#13;
period 1995-2000. If national funding continues at current level, it will cover nearly 50% of&#13;
the shortfall of external funding in the period 1995-2000.&#13;
2.26         The project would support the NMCP in providing inputs to meet the needs&#13;
that are insufficiently covered by the other funders of the NMCP. This support would aim to&#13;
cover the population at high malaria risk by:&#13;
* locally effective anti-vector measures, particularly impregnated bednets;&#13;
* improved program management including better epidemiological services; and&#13;
* training, supervision, communications and program-related applied field research.&#13;
2.27         The inputs required include insecticides, equipment, means of transport,&#13;
training and technical assistance. The main thrust of this support would be to assure the&#13;
provision of a major proportion of the commodities that must be imported and a proportion of&#13;
the national training needs that require international support.&#13;
National Tuberculosis Program&#13;
2.28         The project would aim  to reduce tuberculosis incidence in the general&#13;
population as well as cure infected patients through attainment of a case finding rate of 70%&#13;
of new infectious patients, and cure 85% of all patients enrolled in chemotherapy. The main&#13;
inputs in this sub-component would be drugs, equipment, means of transport, training and&#13;
operations support. An integral part of the program approach would be careful patient&#13;
follow-up to mitigate the risk of insufficient patient compliance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Acute Respiratory Infections Program&#13;
2.29        The national ARI program aims to extend coverage to 100% of children under&#13;
five by the year 1999. At present, it reaches only half the children in need. The program&#13;
emphasizes the training of health workers and supply of appropriate antibiotics in&#13;
standardizing case management in health facilities, particularly at the commune and district&#13;
levels. The project would finance drug treatment costs of ARI cases as well as support&#13;
implementation of the case management approach on a scale necessary to cover gaps in the&#13;
national program. These inputs would complement the large bulk of assistance provided by&#13;
UNICEF to the ARI program to cover most development and program costs.&#13;
Component 3: Strengthening Institutional Health Planning and Management in&#13;
the Ministry of Health&#13;
(US$4.7 million equivalent estimated base cost)&#13;
2.30        This component is directed at improving the beneficial impact of policies&#13;
affecting the health sector. It would expand and enrich the Government's knowledge about&#13;
the management of resources for health in the current rapidly changing market economy&#13;
context. In a poor country like Viet Nam where resources are scarce for all, resources are&#13;
even scarcer for the poor. Thus, Component 3 is a strategic investment in attaining better&#13;
health for the poor. It would assist in promoting health among the most vulnerable groups by&#13;
enhancing the capacity of MOH to use several important health sector planning and&#13;
management tools.&#13;
Sub-component 1: Improving the Planning and Management of Public Expenditures for&#13;
Health&#13;
2.31        Given the large magnitude of public funds spent for health, better management&#13;
of public expenditures for health is recognized as a high priority in order to achieve adequate&#13;
quality, coverage and utilization of public health services and achieve significant reductions in&#13;
the country's major public health problems.&#13;
2.32        This sub-component would achieve two specific objectives:&#13;
(i) Improve the budgeting, accounting and operational reporting systems of&#13;
central MOH hospitals and institutes, provincial health departments and the&#13;
central MOH.   The following activities would be undertaken to achieve this&#13;
objective: (a) The MOH, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, would review&#13;
policies and practices in financial accounting, budget preparation and execution, and&#13;
operations reporting at central hospitals and institutes, provincial health departments&#13;
and the central MOH; (b) pilot demonstration projects would be conducted at selected&#13;
institutions to install the government-approved budgeting, accounting and operations&#13;
reporting system; (c) the recommendations that come out of this pilot experience&#13;
would be presented for wider implementation and would result in the production of an&#13;
annual report on the sources and uses of funds in the public health sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
(ii) Prepare a public investment plan for the health sector that defines the&#13;
priorities and  levels of public investments to  be financed  from  general&#13;
government revenues and donor assistance.  The MOH, in consultation with&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Investment, would: (a) prepare cost estimates and projections&#13;
to meet national goals and targets; (b) monitor donor assistance; (c) prepare a public&#13;
investment plan for the health sector; and (d) use data from a household survey on&#13;
health and expenditures to prepare a report on the actual distribution of public&#13;
expenditures for health.&#13;
2.33         The main inputs to this sub-component would be funding of local service&#13;
contracts, equipment, foreign and local technical assistance, training, fellowships and&#13;
operations support.&#13;
Sub-component 2: Mobilizing Private Financing for Health&#13;
2.34         Available data indicates that in 1993 households spent US$750 million for&#13;
health, accounting for as much as 84% of total national expenditures on health. This money&#13;
went mainly toward expenditures on drugs associated with treatment obtained from public&#13;
facilities, drugs for self-medication, and fees and drug costs associated with private providers.&#13;
Though such private expenditures for health allow for a wider variety of choices for the client&#13;
and assist the expansion of the health sector, there are serious concerns regarding the&#13;
effectiveness of much of this spending as well as the adverse effect on the poor due to this&#13;
increased reliance on private financing for health.&#13;
2.35         In order to assist the Government to better mobilize and utilize private&#13;
financing of health, this sub-component is directed to meet two specific objectives:&#13;
(i) Improve the system of setting, charging and collecting prices for publicly&#13;
provided health services to better protect the poor and increase revenues&#13;
available to enhance the quality and quantity of these services. The MOH and&#13;
other relevant agencies would: (a) prepare a technical framework for setting prices in&#13;
the public health sector and monitoring responses to these prices; (b) establish a&#13;
system of sentinel sites for gathering data on levels and trends of key provider-side&#13;
parameters in the technical framework for setting prices and monitoring responses; (c)&#13;
organize a series of small-scale pilots to experiment in administering public subsidies&#13;
for medical care that protect the poor; and (d) train a corps of technical professionals&#13;
from relevant departments of MOH and other government and academic institutions in&#13;
health economics and health care financing.&#13;
(ii) Prepare proposals for further expanding private production of health&#13;
services in a manner consistent with health sector goals. The MOH and other&#13;
relevant agencies would: (a) undertake a survey of other countries' experience in&#13;
using private sector providers for health; and (b) prepare studies which review current&#13;
practices, assess the prospects for further expansion, and identify barriers and&#13;
opportunities to possible roles of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
2.36         The main inputs to this sub-component are technical assistance (both&#13;
international and local), funding of study tours and pilot studies and training.&#13;
Sub-component 3: Generating Population-based Household Data and Analysis for Health&#13;
Sector Planning and Management&#13;
2.37         Much of health sector planning and management in Viet Nam has been based&#13;
on administrative data from health facilities and small-scale surveys of communities. The&#13;
Government has recognized that it is time to lay a solid base of household survey data series&#13;
as one of the foundations for effective and equitable health planning and management. In&#13;
particular, the Government wants to invest in data gathering and analysis on the health sector&#13;
in order to: (i) enhance the technical quality of policies and plans in the sector, and (ii)&#13;
improve the effectiveness of policies and plans, particularly in terms of benefiting the poor,&#13;
through increased knowledge about interactions between the public and private sectors,&#13;
households and providers, resources and outcomes.  The sub-component is directed to&#13;
meeting two objectives:&#13;
(i) Design, plan, organize and implement the first national household health and&#13;
medical provider survey. The MOH, in consultation with the General Statistical&#13;
Office (GSO), would determine the sample frame, develop the questionnaire, recruit&#13;
and train field work staff, undertake field work and quality control, and train and equip&#13;
MOH/GSO Units involved.&#13;
(ii) Report, analyze, utilize and disseminate the data and results from the first&#13;
national household health and medical provider survey for planning and&#13;
management. The MOH, in consultation with GSO, would enter and clean the&#13;
collected data, prepare a statistical abstract and analysis, disseminate reports and&#13;
studies, and conduct workshops and seminars to discuss the findings of the survey, the&#13;
results of policy analysis and proposals for policy directions.&#13;
2.38         The main inputs to this sub-component are technical assistance (both&#13;
international and local), training (local and international), and funding of the operational costs&#13;
of the development and execution of the survey.&#13;
2.39         A detailed description of the activities to be undertaken in Component 3 is&#13;

3.   PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.1          Summary of Project Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at&#13;
Vietnamese Dong 1,400.5 billion or US$127.3 million equivalent, including contingencies and&#13;
taxes. Project costs are summarized by project component in Table 3.1, and by expenditure&#13;
category in Table 3.2. These costs by year are provided in Annex 8.&#13;
3.2         Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance for&#13;
unforeseen physical additions at 3% of base costs (US$3.0 million equivalent) and for inflation&#13;
at 7% of base costs (US$8.2 million equivalent), based on the standard Bank-wide and&#13;
regional guidelines on inflation factors.&#13;
3.3         Taxes and Duties: The Government has made a decision that all Bank-financed&#13;
projects are subject to customs duties and taxes. Project cost estimates therefore include&#13;
customs duties for equipment and taxes for civil works (US$3.5 million equivalent), which&#13;
would be fully financed by the Govemment. During negotiations, the Government confirmed&#13;
to IDA that it will make available to MOH a budget allocation, as part of counterpart funds, to&#13;
cover the cost of these customs duties and taxes.  Project cost estimates for technical&#13;
assistance and training have been calculated net of taxes. The Government would also cover&#13;
from its own resources any taxes related to consultancy services.&#13;
3.4         Foreign Exchange Costs.  Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs are&#13;
estimated at about 65% of base project costs. The estimated foreign exchange component for&#13;
the various expenditure categories are as follows: civil works, 30%; furniture and equipment&#13;
89%; drugs, 95%; foreign technical assistance, 90%; local technical assistance, 10%; overseas&#13;
training, 95%; local training, 20%; program support, 10%; and maintenance, 20%.&#13;
3.5         Incremental Recurrent Costs. The investments under the project targeted at&#13;
strengthening existing health service facilities at the grass roots level would not add a major&#13;
burden in terms of recurrent costs. The disease control component would actually reduce&#13;
recurrent costs in the long term by decreasing the recurrent costs associated with&#13;
communicable disease control.  However, two types of incremental recurrent costs are&#13;
included in the total project costs. The first type is maintenance and logistics costs--the&#13;
maintenance of civil works (4.5% of the base cost of civil works) and maintenance of&#13;
equipment (8.1% of the base costs of equipment). These maintenance costs of US$4.5 million&#13;
(including contingencies) over the seven year project period would be fully financed by the&#13;
Government.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that an appropriate budget for&#13;
maintenance would be made available for the Provincial Project Implementation Units. The&#13;
logistics cost (2% of baseline costs, amounting to US$2.9 million including contingencies) for&#13;
storing and distributing equipment and drugs would also be fully financed by the Government.&#13;
The second type of incremental recurrent costs is program support needed during the life of&#13;
the project. Part of such costs are travel accommodation, office supplies and communications&#13;
expenses, amounting to US$7.3 million including contingencies needed, for carrying out&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
3.11        Procurement for works, goods and services to be financed by the IDA credit&#13;
would be as follows:&#13;
(a) Civil Works: The civil works carried out under the project would generally be small and&#13;
simple, consisting primarily of repair and/or renovation of the existing buildings at the district&#13;
and commune level, and would be dispersed throughout the project provinces. Owing to the&#13;
nature and size of these works, National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, would be appropriate to use since no foreign contractors are likely to be&#13;
interested in bidding for them. The total estimated cost of these works is US$22.2 million&#13;
including contingencies. The Ministry of Health would group these works in suitable packages&#13;
so as to minimize the number of contracts with a view to managing the NCB efficiently. Up to&#13;
a total amount of US$3.7 million, civil works would be carried out by awarding relatively small&#13;
contracts, each valued at about US$30,000, by obtaining at least three quotations from local&#13;
contractors. This would apply in remote areas where packaging would not be possible so as to&#13;
follow NCB procedures. The MOH would draft the bidding documents following the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works (Smaller Contracts), January 1995.&#13;
(b) Goods (Equipment. Furniture, Vehicles, Drugs and Medical Supplies):  Equipment and&#13;
materials are estimated to cost US$32.2 million including contingencies. Of this amount,&#13;
equipment costing US$22.4 million would be procured by International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB) procedures; and US$8 million, with an estimated cost of US$100,000 equivalent or less&#13;
per contract, may be procured   by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank. This would include some hospital equipment and&#13;
furniture.   However, surgical equipment (estimated cost of US$5 million), owing to its&#13;
specific end-user needs and functional usage, would be procured by NCB as the Vietnamese&#13;
experience in the past indicates that it would not be useful to use ICB since no foreign supplier&#13;
manufactures them in the smaller sizes required to meet the needs of the country (differences in&#13;
anthropometric measurements). Small items or group of items costing less than US$25,000&#13;
per contract, subject to an aggregate amount of US$0.6 million, would be procured by prudent&#13;
shopping, requiring quotations from  at least three reputable suppliers.  All drugs and&#13;
pharmaceuticals (estimated cost of US$46.6 million including contingencies) would be&#13;
procured by ICB procedures. Under ICB, domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a&#13;
margin of preference in bids evaluation of 15% of the c.i.f costs of the competing imports or&#13;
the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. MOH would prepare the bidding documents&#13;
following: (a) the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods, January&#13;
1995 for procurement of equipment and materials, and (b) the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Document for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, September 1993 (as amended&#13;
to reflect the changes as per the Bank's Guidelines, January 1995 for procuring drugs and&#13;
pharmaceuticals).&#13;
(c) Training and Technical Assistance:  This includes training (US$5.2 million including&#13;
contingencies and excluding taxes), technical assistance (US$4.3 million including&#13;
contingencies and excluding taxes), and operational research (US$2.3 million including&#13;
contingencies and excluding taxes) to be carried out by the provincial secondary medical&#13;
schools or national institutes, which are the sole-sources either in a particular technical field, or&#13;
in a particular province. MOH would award these assignments, with the exception of technical&#13;
assistance, to these agencies, and enter into "responsibility contracts" with them to carry out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
the assignments. However, before entrusting these assignments, MOH would provide the&#13;
Bank with its standard contract for comment to ensure that these contracts comply with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency. MOH also would need to prepare a letter of invitation and the contract for&#13;
the technical assistance activity for the Bank's comment following the Bank's Standard Form&#13;
of Contractfor Consulting Services, June 1995&#13;
3.12        Procurement Review. All civil works contracts in excess of US$150,000&#13;
(including the first two civil works contracts regardless of their respective estimated cost), all&#13;
goods contracts in excess of US$150,000 and all consulting contracts in excess of US$100,000&#13;
for firms (US$50,000 for individuals) would be subject to prior review by the Bank. With&#13;
respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of value, prior review will be required for: (a)&#13;
terms of reference; (b) single source contracts regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts&#13;
and assignments of a critical nature (because of environmental safety or public health&#13;
considerations) regardless of value; and (d) contract amendments valued at more than&#13;
US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals), or those that raise the total contract value&#13;
to more than US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals). This will allow prior review&#13;
for approximately 80% of the works and goods procured under the project.&#13;
3.13        MOH would use the Bank's latest Standard Bidding Documents as follows: (a)&#13;
Procurement of Works (Smaller Contracts), January 1995 and as adapted to Viet Nam's local&#13;
requirements to carry out NCB procurement; (b) Procurement of Goods, January 1995 for&#13;
materials and equipment; (c) Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, September 1993&#13;
as amended to reflect the changes as per the Bank's Guidelines of January 1995; and (d)&#13;
Standard Form of Contract for Consulting Services, June 1995. Accordingly, MOH would&#13;
draft and submit bidding documents to the Bank by September 1995 for its review and&#13;
approval so that it can use these documents during the implementation of the project and in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995).&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
3.14        The proposed IDA Credit of US$101.2 million equivalent would be disbursed&#13;
over a period of seven and a half years, with disbursements to be completed by the closing date&#13;
of September. 30, 2003. The proposed disbursement schedule, as given in Annex 9 is&#13;
considered feasible. The schedule has relatively high levels of early disbursements because of&#13;
concentrated early procurement of equipment and civil works necessary for facility upgrading.&#13;
Draft bidding documents are already finalized. The Resident Mission will provide substantial&#13;
support to the Project Management Unit (PMU) and provincial PIUs in handling procurement&#13;
and disbursement during the early implementation period. Special arrangements are also being&#13;
made by the PMU in MOH, with the help of IDA, to organize workshops on procurement and&#13;
disbursement for the national institutes and provincial health services.&#13;
3.15        Disbursements would be made against: (a) 90% of the total expenditures for&#13;
civil works; (b) 100% of c.i.f. cost for directly imported goods, including drugs (foreign&#13;
expenditures), 100% of the ex-factory expenditures for locally manufactured goods, and 85%&#13;
of the other off-shelf goods procured locally; (c) 100% of the total expenditures for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
consultancies and training; and (d) 70% of the total expenditures for program support.&#13;
Disbursements categories to be made against the IDA credit are summarized in Table 3.5.&#13;

3.16         Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for&#13;
civil works contracts with a contract value of less than US$150,000, for goods contracts with&#13;
a contract value of less than US$150,000 equivalent, and consulting contracts less than&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and less than US$50,000 for individual consultants, and for training and&#13;
program support costs. All documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by the PMIU in&#13;
MOH, and made available for random sample review by IDA supervision missions. For all&#13;
contracts above these limits, full documentation would be required.&#13;
3.17         Special Accounts. A Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$3&#13;
million, based on four month's average expected expenditures, would be established in a bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The first withdrawal will be limited to an amount equivalent to US$1.5&#13;
million until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total&#13;
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by IDA shall be equal to or exceed&#13;
the equivalent of US$16 million. The PMIU at the MOH would control and operate the&#13;
Account. All the documentation for the operation of the Account would be retained in the&#13;
PMU in MOH, and made available for review by IDA. Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
Account, supported by appropriate documentation, would be monthly or whenever the account&#13;
is drawn by 20% of the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. For withdrawals outside&#13;
the Special Account (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments),&#13;
a minimum application value of 20% of the authorized allocation would be observed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization&#13;
4.1         The project would be implemented by the Ministry of Health, with the&#13;
collaboration of the provincial health services of the fifteen provinces, including their&#13;
component district health centers and commune health centers.  Overall direction and&#13;
guidance for the project would be provided by a high level Steering Committee composed of a&#13;
senior official from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, the&#13;
National Committee for Population and Family Planning, and the State Bank of Viet Nam, in&#13;
addition to the Minister of Health.&#13;
4.2         The implementation of individual components and sub-components of the&#13;
project would be assigned to existing organizational units of the MOH and to the provincial&#13;
health services of the fifteen provincial governments in which Component 1 of the project will&#13;
operate. The appointed heads of these units, such as Institute Directors, MOH Department&#13;
Directors and Provincial Health Service Directors, would have direct responsibility for&#13;
managing the component or sub-component activities assigned to their unit as part of their&#13;
existing programs as well as their regular and official duties--see Figure 4.1 on the overall&#13;
implementation structure for the project.&#13;
4.3         Certain regular officials of the MOH and provincial health departments would&#13;
be designated as NHSP officers with specific duties that they would need to perform in&#13;
addition to and with priority over their regular and official functions. From the MOH, this&#13;
would include: the NHSP Project Director, the Lead Person for Component 1, and the Lead&#13;
Person for Component 3, among others. From the provincial health services, this would&#13;
include the Provincial Project Manager. Annex 10 sets out for each of these officials the&#13;
project responsibilities that have been discussed with MOH.&#13;
4.4         A group of regular MOH staff and contractually employed personnel would&#13;
constitute a Project Management Unit (PMU). The latter would be hired specifically for the&#13;
project and only for the duration of the need for their services. The PMU would be&#13;
established to assist the MOH and provincial health officials assigned to manage the project.&#13;
These personnel would include: the Manager of the PMU, various contractual staff of the&#13;
PMU including provincial project specialists (one per NHSP province). All these personnel&#13;
would serve the project full-time and would perform only duties related to the project. The&#13;
functions to be carried out by the PMU are detailed in Annex 10.&#13;
4.5         While an interim PMU has been in operation for purposes of project&#13;
preparation, formal designation of the project management structure for implementation will&#13;
be necessary.  Government confirmed during negotiations its concurrence with the&#13;
specification of the structures and authorities for project management set out in Annex 10. A&#13;
condition of effectiveness would be confirmation of the establishment of the NHSP Project&#13;
Steering Committee. During negotiations assurances were provided that the Steering&#13;
Committee would be maintained during implementation for overall oversight of project&#13;
implementation, on the basis of criteria acceptable to IDA. Further steps before effectiveness&#13;
include the issuance of a decision on the creation of a central Project Management Unit, and&#13;

the designation of other MOH units involved in implementing specific components or sub-&#13;
components of the project. This would also include specific provisions on how the PMU will&#13;
be staffed by full-time personnel of adequate qualifications. If this is to be met by assigning&#13;
existing MOH employees, initial designations would be made. If this is to be met by hiring&#13;
contractual employees, agreement with MOF or MPI, as appropriate, to do so providing rates&#13;
and sources of funding would be documented. This will also include the identification of&#13;
office area, provision of adequate office equipment, and setting aside sufficient operating&#13;
funds for coordinating the nation-wide implementation of the project.  A condition of&#13;
effectiveness would be provision of evidence satisfactory to IDA that the Project&#13;
Management Unit has been established and its manager appointed Assurances were&#13;
provided during negotiations that the PMU would be maintained during implementation for&#13;
coordination of project implementation, on the basis of criteria acceptable to IDA, as&#13;
outlined in Annex IO.&#13;
4.6         Implementation of the project would depend on existing MOH and provincial&#13;
health department structures and processes as far as possible. Existing bodies in the MOH&#13;
such as the National Drug Policy Council, Committee on Medical Prices and other relevant&#13;
bodies officially created would deliberate on matters involving project implementation.&#13;
Similar bodies at the provincial level would also be utilized for executing project activities.&#13;
The MOH  would establish, as appropriate, mechanisms/structures to ensure effective&#13;
interdepartmental coordination for project implementation.&#13;
4.7         Whenever necessary, the NHSP Director, as delegated by the Minister of&#13;
Health, may create ad hoc recommendatory bodies to undertake various tasks and coordinate&#13;
decisions regarding the project. For instance, various bodies may be established such as:&#13;
Technical Evaluation Committees to technically review proposals or offers of contractors to&#13;
the project; a Project Budget Review Committee to review and consolidate the various&#13;
proposals of implementing units for their respective annual project budgets; other special&#13;
committees to handle specific tasks. Once officially created, these bodies would perform&#13;
functions in project implementation.&#13;
4.8         Experience with other IDA-financed projects in Viet Nam to date highlights&#13;
the importance of having in place at effectiveness the requirements for rapid project start up.&#13;
Budgetary provisions are especially important. Government would be asked to provide a first&#13;
year implementation plan for the project, including a first year project budget before&#13;
effectiveness. In addition, if required by Government procedures, available budget authorities&#13;
to disburse project funds in 1996 would need to be identified.&#13;
4.9         Lastly, since much of the actual implementation of Component 1 activities will&#13;
be undertaken by provincial authorities, it will be essential that MOH negotiate with and reach&#13;
agreement with the respective People's Committees of the 15 participating provinces on a&#13;
number of critical implementation matters. A condition of effectiveness would be provision&#13;
of evidence satisfactory to IDA that the Provincial Implementation Units (PIUs) have been&#13;
established and their managers appointed. Assurances were provided during negotiations&#13;
that the provincial PIUs would be maintained during implementation for assisting Provincial&#13;
Health Service Directors to implement the project, on the basis of criteria acceptable to IDA,&#13;
as set out in Annex IO. Also, during negotiations, the Government provided assurances that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
it would take all necessary steps to ensure that each of the project provinces implements its&#13;
activities under the project and is provided, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services&#13;
and other resources requiredfor that purpose.&#13;
B . Accounts and Auditing&#13;
4.10        The total project account would be maintained by the PMU in MOH, and&#13;
separate accounts for the project components (activities) would also be maintained by each&#13;
local government of the project provinces and the MOH Institute of Malariology,&#13;
Parasitology, and Entomology and the Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices. The project accounts would reflect all financial&#13;
transactions during the project implementation period for both IDA Credit and counterpart&#13;
funding in two books, one by project components, and one by expenditure categories. The&#13;
project accounts would be separated from any routine budget account and other foreign-&#13;
financed project accounts.&#13;
4.11        The project accounts would be audited in accordance with Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (The World&#13;
Bank, March 1982). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that audits of project-&#13;
related records and accounts, including the Special Account, would be undertaken in&#13;
accordance with appropriate accounting principles consistently applied, by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts andfinancial statements, in a format&#13;
agreed with IDA, and including separate audits of Statement of Expenditures, would be sent&#13;
to IDA within nine months of the end of each Government fiscal year.&#13;
C. Progress Reviews and Reporting&#13;
4.12        The PMU would be responsible for monitoring project implementation&#13;
progress and performance.  Within the framework of the project's basic strategy and&#13;
objectives, and the design of its three components, fourteen key indicators have been agreed&#13;
upon to measure project impact and achievement. These indicators would provide measures&#13;
of the: (1) number of CHCs improved as a proportion of total CHCs targeted; (2) number of&#13;
DHCs improved as a proportion of total DHCs targeted; (3) utilization of CHCs; (4) infant&#13;
mortality rate; (5) maternal mortality rate; (6) malaria prevalence rate; (7) malaria case fatality&#13;
rate; (8) TB case-finding rate; (9) TB cure rate; (10) proportion of the population with access&#13;
to adequate primary health services; (11) share of public spending allocated to commune- and&#13;
district-level services; (12) project disbursement rate; (13) average time deviation of actual&#13;
procurement actions with planned milestones; and (14) actions taken in key policy areas.&#13;
Further description of these indicators is found in Annex 11. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were provided that the Government would maintain operational procedures adequate to&#13;
enable it to monitor and evaluate overall project implementation progress and impact, in&#13;
accordance with the indicators set out in Annex 11, including the impact on various&#13;
communities in the project provinces, in particular those with ethnic minority populations&#13;
(see para. 4.18).&#13;
4.13        The PMU would produce progress reports based on service statistics and other&#13;
field data. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that it would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
furnish semi-annual reports to IDA by June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning in&#13;
September 1996.   These reports would constitute the basis for semi-annual project&#13;
performance reviews to be undertaken with IDA. In addition, assurances were obtained that&#13;
an annual project workplan and budget for the next fiscal year would be furnished to IDA by&#13;
August 31 of each year, beginning in Auigust 1966. The PMU would be responsible for&#13;
organizing annual workshops with the provincial PRJs to review implementation progress,&#13;
which would be timed to support annual preparation of operational plans and budgets.&#13;
4.14        At mid-term, the MOH would conduct a comprehensive review to determine if&#13;
there is a need for major changes to project design and implementation targets. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would, by March 31, 1999,&#13;
carry out a comprehensive mid-term review of project implementation on the basis of terms&#13;
of reference developed in consultation with IDA. Agreements were reached to ensure that&#13;
within six months of the Closing Date, the Government would submit to IDA a final&#13;
evaluation report on the project and a plani of such scope and detail as IDA may request for&#13;
the future operation of the completed project.&#13;
D. Impact on Women&#13;
4.15        Maternal mortality and morbidity in Viet Nam is high (the maternal mortality&#13;
ratio is reported to vary from 100 to 200 per 100,000 births) and there is a high incidence of&#13;
reproductive tract infections among Vietnamese women. The project would promote birth&#13;
spacing, provide a choice of contraceptive services, improve the quality of safe motherhood&#13;
interventions, and provide reproductive health services.  In combination with the IDA-&#13;
financed Population and Family Health Project, the project would increase women's&#13;
knowledge of desired health behaviors and encourage utilization of maternal and child health&#13;
services.&#13;
E. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.16        The proposed project would have no significant impact on the environment.&#13;
Protocols would be developed for safe disposal of syringes at all health facilities covered&#13;
under Component I of the project, and their implementation would be monitored as part of&#13;
project supervision.  Two pesticides will be used in the project, PERMETHRAN and&#13;
LAMBDACYHALOTRIN (ICON). Both are classified as "unlikely to present any health&#13;
hazards in normal use". Although both pesticides are harmful to aquatic fauna (particularly&#13;
fish), their specific-restricted use in malaria control for impregnation of bednets and residual&#13;
spraying of houses excludes any negative environmental impact. Project activities will not&#13;
result in the involuntary resettlement or displacement of any persons. In the long-term, an&#13;
improved rural health care system, which includes adequate provision of family planning&#13;
services, will lower fertility rates and reduce environmental pressures associated with rapid&#13;
population growth.&#13;
4.17        Five of the provinces in which Component I of the project will operate have&#13;
significant ethnic minority populations (Cao Bang, Lang Son and Son La in the Northerm&#13;
Mountains region and Gia Lai and Kon Tum in the Central Highlands). Overall, ethnic&#13;
minorities constitute 13 percent of the Vietnamese population. Most of these minority groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
are relatively disadvantaged. They mainly inhabit the mountainous, forested or remote parts&#13;
of the country, often living in small and scattered settlements that are difficult to access. As&#13;
part of project preparation for IDA's Population and Family Health Project (PFHP)--to be&#13;
implemented concurrently with the NHSP--, two studies were carried out on ethnic minorities&#13;
in Viet Nam by an anthropologist with long experience in Thailand and Viet Nam. The&#13;
findings are also applicable to the NISP. The major finding was that the disadvantages of&#13;
these groups in Viet Nam stem primarily from lack of access to services.&#13;
4.18         The PFHP will fund a number of studies to build up a better data base on&#13;
ethnic minorities and their distinctive health and family planning needs. A baseline national&#13;
survey for the PFHP will be undertaken that will over-sample ethnic minority populations,&#13;
including collection of information on how well the service delivery system responds to the&#13;
particular needs of ethnic minorities. Additional participatory studies will be carried out to&#13;
allow minorities to communicate their distinctive family population and family health needs,&#13;
and examine the nature of care during pregnancy and delivery, and more general issues with&#13;
respect to family health care (reasons for non-use of CHCs, etc.). The PFHP will also fund&#13;
pilot efforts to explore how to deliver family health services more effectively in remote areas,&#13;
e.g., experimentation with village-based health posts (Annex 12 summarizes these studies and&#13;
pilot efforts). Since the NHSP will deliver the same basic services through the same MOH&#13;
structure at the local level as the PFHP, the findings of these studies and pilots will be directly&#13;
applicable to the NHSP.  The NHSP will therefore incorporate these results into its&#13;
implementation activities in the same manner as will the PFHP. In addition, in each of the&#13;
training modules of the project, technical assistance will be employed to design practical&#13;
methods for assessing the training needs of ethnic minorities, designing or adapting training&#13;
modules for them, and evaluating the training outcomes in ethnic minority areas. The training&#13;
program will also include workshops on training techniques for ethnic minorities in all&#13;
provinces where applicable. Special attention will be paid to assessing how well the project is&#13;
meeting its objectives in ethnic minority areas as part of the mid-term  review.  During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were provided that the Government will carry out the project in&#13;
accordance with a strategy, satisfactory to IDA, which (a) shall be designed on the basis of&#13;
studies and surveys undertaken by qualified experts under terms of reference and timing&#13;
satisfactory to IDA; and (b) include provisions for the informed participation of, and&#13;
consultation with, a variety of representative communities in the project provinces, in&#13;
particular ethnic minorities, to ensure that the design and implementation thereafter of the&#13;
project adequately addresses the needs and preferences of such communities.&#13;
4.19         There are no resettlement issues in the project.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
4.20         The annual recurrent cost implications of the project have been estimated to&#13;
represent less than one percent of the projected national health budget at the end of the&#13;
project. It would seem reasonable that this level of costs could be maintained. However, it is&#13;
essential that the project investments not only be sustainable but also be ones that are cost&#13;
effective. World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health argues that the inclusion of&#13;
health care as part of a strategy for combating poverty justifies the public financing of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
minimum package of '"ssential" clinical or individual services. It identifies five clusters of&#13;
interventions that have been found to be highly cost-effective: prenatal and delivery care,&#13;
family planning services, management of the sick child (with particular attention to diarrheal&#13;
diseases, ARI, measles and malaria), treatment of tuberculosis and case management of&#13;
sexually transmitted diseases. These particular interventions are at the core of the National&#13;
Health Support Project. The World Development Report (WDR) 1993 estimates that these&#13;
five interventions each cost less than US$50 per DALY in low income countries, estimates&#13;
that are believed to be applicable to Viet Nam. WDR 1993 estimates the cost of tuberculosis&#13;
control by short-term chemotherapy in low income countries at US$3-5 per DALY, making it&#13;
one of the most cost-effective of all interventions. The cost per DALY may be even less in&#13;
Viet Nam given predominant treatment of ambulatory cases rather than the more expensive&#13;
option of hospitalization that is used in some countries.  Global estimates of  case&#13;
management of ARI suggest a cost per DALY of about US$37 and there is no reason to&#13;
believe this estimate does not apply to Viet Nam.&#13;
4.21         The project's field level interventions have therefore been chosen as priorities&#13;
for the project because they address health problems that cause a large disease burden in Viet&#13;
Nam but also are ones for which well-documented, cost-effective measures are available. As&#13;
such, they constitute interventions that should result in demonstrable gains in health status and&#13;
thus be interventions that Government would want to sustain.&#13;
4.22         A broader issue concerns the project's focus on support for the health&#13;
problems of the poor.  There is concern in the Government that regional inequalities could&#13;
worsen in the near term in the course of anticipated overall economic growth. Thus, for the&#13;
foreseeable future there is likely to be political support for directing resources to improving&#13;
health care in the poorer provinces targeted by the project. However, it is also the case that&#13;
current expenditure patterns in the sector are clearly not sustainable. The bulk of public&#13;
resources are going to large hospitals, in part due to demand caused by failures at lower levels&#13;
in the health system. The project aims to, among other things, strengthen local delivery&#13;
systems, thus lessening the demands on higher level, more expensive care; make more&#13;
transparent the MOH's resource allocation process so that resources increasingly go to&#13;
provision of more cost-effective health services, and facilitate increased private financing of&#13;
care, where appropriate, thus lessening the burden on public funding of health care. Together&#13;
these measures should lead to a more sustainable health sector.&#13;
4.23         Even taking into account increased efficiencies in the sector, IDA needs to be&#13;
assured of Government commitment to sustaining project activities after the completion of&#13;
the project. This issue must be viewed from a sector perspective and not only a project one.&#13;
The policy component of the project, particularly the work on public expenditures on health,&#13;
will assist the Government to identify sector-wide inefficiencies with the view to directing&#13;
resources to sustaining the public health/public good objectives of the project over time.&#13;
Thus, as the project progresses, IDA's overall policy dialogue will need to explicitly focus on&#13;
the issue of sustainability. This would have two dimensions. The macroeconomic work&#13;
carried out under the proposed SAC II would address the issue of overall allocations for the&#13;
sector. The work carried out at the sectoral level under the public expenditure component of&#13;
the project would focus on the composition of these allocations, with particular attention to&#13;
encouraging adequate investments in priority public health areas. These two concerns would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
then be brought together during the project mid-term review in the form of an exchange of&#13;
views between the Government and IDA concerning long-term investments in the sector.&#13;
This would also provide an opportunity to review the question of striking an appropriate&#13;
balance between cost recovery and the resource needs of the sector. In addition, IDA would&#13;
also need to play a role in encouraging other donors to reinforce the emphasis on having the&#13;
Government sustain investments in public health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1          The project would result in better primary health care for people in rural areas&#13;
of 15 of the poorest provinces in Viet Nam through improvements in the grass roots health&#13;
delivery systems. Upgraded health facilities that are equipped with adequate equipment and&#13;
essential drug supplies, and staffed by personnel who have had their skills and knowledge&#13;
improved through retraining would result in a much improved primary health care system that&#13;
delivers quality care. These benefits would be especially important to women and children&#13;
who are affected most by the current lack of adequate maternal and child health care services.&#13;
Given similar inputs from IDA's concurrent Population and Family Health Project in an&#13;
additional 15 provinces, over half of Viet Nam's 53 provinces would benefit from the two&#13;
projects. Approximately 52% of the total population of Viet Nam in the year 2002 will have&#13;
benefited from these projects. This would result in significant overall improvements in health&#13;
status in the country, particularly with respect to maternal, child and reproductive health.&#13;
5.2         The 15 NHSP provinces will have a projected population of about 19 million in&#13;
the year 2002 or 24% of Viet Nam's total population, who would benefit from access to&#13;
improved primary health care. Beneficiaries of the core Component I interventions, covering&#13;
maternal and young child care plus family planning, would amount to an average of 3.7 million&#13;
annually, made up of about 500,000 women requiring maternal care, around 1.2 million&#13;
children under three years of age and around 2 million contraceptors.&#13;
5.3         The project's support to national communicable disease control programs&#13;
would result in a substantial nationwide reduction over time in morbidity and mortality due to&#13;
malaria,  tuberculosis, and ARI.  As both malaria and tuberculosis lead to reduced&#13;
productivity in the labor force on the part of those infected, these reductions would have&#13;
important benefits to the economy.  Moreover, when such programs are effectively&#13;
implemented, especially in the case of tuberculosis, reductions in the number of new cases are&#13;
usually long-term. Thus, there are also economic gains to be achieved as a consequence of&#13;
reducing the current costs to the health system  of  treatment.  Specific numbers of&#13;
beneficiaries for each control program are provided below.&#13;
5.4         While the exact number of TB cases is not known, MOH estimates that there&#13;
about 130,000 cases annually. Currently, 55,000 cases are detected per year, a detection rate&#13;
of 42%. Most importantly, the project seeks to achieve a cure rate of 85% of all detected&#13;
cases. While maintaining this essential focus on an appropriate cure rate, it also targets a&#13;
gradual increase in the detection rate to 70% of all cases over the life of the project.&#13;
5.5         Some 35 million people, or a little less than half of Viet Nam's total&#13;
population, are at risk of malaria. Fifteen million are exposed to intense malaria transmission.&#13;
Migration trends are likely to result in an even larger population at risk in the absence of&#13;
improved malaria control. The malaria control program targets proper treatment of some&#13;
800,000 clinical malaria cases at the primary level in 1996 with an overall program aim of&#13;
reducing the number of cases of malaria by about 100,000 per year during the project. It also&#13;
seeks to keep malaria outbreaks in the country to under 30 per year. Although the program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
suggests reductions in mortality from malaria that would be achieved over the life of the&#13;
project, it is not proposed to attempt to measure these reductions.&#13;
5.6          An estimated total of some 10 million children are at risk of ARI and the total&#13;
number of estimated deaths presently due to ARI is between 25,000 and 30,000 cases per&#13;
year. The ARI national program has a target of treating correctly some 1.2 million children in&#13;
1996 rising to some 3.5 million by the year 2000. This would translate into an estimated&#13;
avoided mortality of about 10,000 children per year.&#13;
5.7          The project's focus on building institutional capacity for policy formulation&#13;
would result in strengthened Government capacity to develop policies for the sector that lead&#13;
to a more effective and efficient use of sector resources over the long-term. An important&#13;
corollary to this would be increased capacity of the Government to achieve its objective of&#13;
effectively targeting health resources for the benefit of the poor. Also, improvements in the&#13;
Government's ability to mobilize private financing of health care by those able to pay for it, as&#13;
well as its ability to promote quality provision of private health care, would lessen pressures&#13;
on the public budget for financing health services as well as free up resources that can be&#13;
directed to the needs of the poor.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.8          There are three main risks. The first is that the Government will not provide&#13;
the financial resources necessary to guarantee the salaries of commune health center workers&#13;
over time. Without this, the other grassroots inputs will have minimal impact. Despite the&#13;
promulgation of an official policy decision, such resources have to date not been made&#13;
available in all provinces. During negotiations, assurances were provided that each commune&#13;
health center and district health center in the project provinces would be appropriately&#13;
staffed in accordance with criteria acceptable to IDA and district health centers provided&#13;
with adequate funding to meet the payroll obligations with respect to related commune&#13;
health center staff A second risk has to do with the generally weak implementation capacity&#13;
of MOH to manage the project at all levels. Of particular importance is the need for a strong&#13;
PMU with qualified, adequately supported staff As noted above (para. 4.5), Government&#13;
would provide adequate staffing and financing for the PMU, satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
5.9    A third risk relates to the previous two. An underlying assumption of the project is&#13;
that, once they are properly staffed and equipped, utilization rates at rural facilities will rise as&#13;
people regain confidence in the services available. Moreover, these services are unlikely to be&#13;
found elsewhere as they are for the most part not ones that the private sector would provide.&#13;
However, people will return to public health facilities only if they are convinced, by the quality&#13;
of care they receive, and by the outreach functions of these facilities (e.g., concerning the&#13;
importance of improved child nutrition), that doing so results in better health. This fact simply&#13;
reinforces the importance of project interventions that are technically sound and that can be&#13;
effectively implemented in such a way that clearly demonstrates their utility to those that need&#13;
them most. It will be important, therefore, to closely monitor response to provision of&#13;
services. As noted above (para. 4.12), a set of performance indicators were agreed upon at&#13;
appraisal. In the course of annual work plan discussions and the mid-term review, progress&#13;
with respect to these indicators will need to be reviewed and adjustments made as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1         During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:&#13;
(a) it would furnish to IDA by September 30, 1996, and have an exchange of&#13;
views with IDA on, a comprehensive description of the policy and&#13;
implementation  guidelines   it will employ  to  ensure  the  effective&#13;
implementation of: (i) cost recovery with respect to the essential drugs and&#13;
medical supplies to be provided by the project in those communes of project&#13;
provinces where applicable; and (ii) providing essential drugs and medical&#13;
supplies free of charge in mountainous and remote communes in project&#13;
provinces. The principles used to designate mountainous and remote&#13;
communes would also be provided. The policy and implementation guidelines&#13;
would be reviewed by the Government and IDA each year thereafter and&#13;
would be an explicit focus of the mid-term review (para. 2.1 1).&#13;
(b) the selection of CHCs and DHCs to be upgraded would be carried out on the&#13;
basis of criteria acceptable to IDA, as described in Annexes 2 and 5 (para.&#13;
2.15).&#13;
(c) the facilities of each commune or district that are upgraded would be&#13;
maintained in accordance with criteria acceptable to IDA (para 2.15).&#13;
(d) an action plan for the training activities under the project would be provided to&#13;
IDA for review and comments by June 30, 1996 (para. 2.22).&#13;
(e) it would maintain the Project Steering Committee during implementation for&#13;
overall oversight of project implementation, on the basis of criteria acceptable&#13;
to IDA (para. 4.5).&#13;
(f) it would maintain the Project Management Unit during implementation for&#13;
coordination of project implementation, on the basis of criteria acceptable to&#13;
IDA, as described in Annex 10 (para. 4.5).&#13;
(g) it would maintain the Provincial Project Implementation Units during&#13;
implementation for assisting the Provincial Health Service Directors to&#13;
implement the project, on the basis of criteria acceptable to IDA, as described&#13;
in Annex 10 (para. 4.9).&#13;
(h) all necessary steps would be taken to ensure that each of the project provinces&#13;
implements its activities under the project and is provided, promptly as needed,&#13;
the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for that purpose&#13;
(para. 4. 9).&#13;
(i) audits of project-related records and accounts, including the Special Account,&#13;
would be undertaken in accordance with appropriate accounting principles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that&#13;
audited accounts and financial statements, in a format agreed with IDA, and&#13;
including separate audits of Statement of Expenditures, would be sent to IDA&#13;
within nine months of the end of each Government fiscal year (para 4.11).&#13;
() operational procedures would be maintained adequate to enable monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of overall project implementation progress and impact, in&#13;
accordance with indicators as set out in Annex 11 (para. 4.12).&#13;
(k) semi-annual reports would be furnished to IDA by June 30 and December 31&#13;
of each year, beginning in September 1996 (para. 4.13).&#13;
(1) an annual work program and budget for the next calendar year would be&#13;
furnished to IDA by August 31 of each year, beginning August 1996 (para.&#13;
4.13).&#13;
(m)by March 31, 1999, a comprehensive mid-term review of project&#13;
implementation would be carried out on the basis of terms of reference&#13;
developed in consultation with IDA. Also, within six months of the Closing&#13;
Date, the Government would submit to IDA a final evaluation report on the&#13;
project and a plan of such scope and detail as IDA may request for the future&#13;
operation of the completed project (para. 4.14).&#13;
(o) surveys, studies and training programs would be undertaken, in accordance&#13;
with criteria acceptable to IDA, to ensure the informed participation of, and&#13;
consultation with, ethnic minority communities (para. 4.18).&#13;
(p) each commune health center and district health center in the project provinces&#13;
would be appropriately staffed in accordance with criteria acceptable to IDA&#13;
and district health centers provided with adequate funding to meet the payroll&#13;
obligations with respect to related commune health center staff (para. 5.8).&#13;
6.2         In addition, during negotiations, the Government reached an understanding&#13;
with IDA on:&#13;
the logistics arrangements for handling project-financed commodities, in&#13;
accordance with discussions held during the appraisal as set out in Annex 4&#13;
(para. 2.1 1).&#13;
6.3          As a condition of effectiveness, the Government would provide evidence&#13;
satisfactory to IDA that:&#13;
(a) the Project Steering Committee shall have been established (para. 4.5).&#13;
(b) the Project Management Unit shall have been established and its manager&#13;
appointed (para. 4.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
(c) the Provincial Project Implementation Units in project provinces where&#13;
Component 1 will operate shall have been established and their managers&#13;
appointed (para. 4.9).&#13;
6.4          In addition to the above agreements, during negotiations the Government&#13;
clarified that:&#13;
(a) it will make available to MOH a budget allocation to cover the cost of customs&#13;
duties and taxes for goods and consultant services; and&#13;
(b) with respect to consultant services, all letters of invitation, contracts and&#13;
invoices submitted for disbursements would be net of taxes (para. 3.3).&#13;
6.5          Subject to the conditions in paras. 6.1 to 6.3 above, the proposed project&#13;
would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR 68 million (US$101.2 million&#13;
equivalent) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam with 40 years maturity, and 10 years of&#13;
grace.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
National Health Support Project&#13;
INVESTING IN AN ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DELIVERING&#13;
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES IN VIET NAM&#13;
1.          Component 1 of the National Health Support Project (NHSP) includes a&#13;
package (drugs, equipment, civil works and retraining) that would provide support for&#13;
Commune Health Centers and District Health Centers. This support is an investment intended&#13;
to secure an essential infrastructure for delivering public health services in Viet Nam. This&#13;
annex outlines the rationale for such a package and details what would be included in such a&#13;
package, including proposed criteria for prioritization of investments in specific districts and&#13;
communes.&#13;
What The Package Does NOT Intend to Do&#13;
2.          Component 1 does not attempt to restore the old, completely subsidized public&#13;
health system. Central and local government plus the donor resources are insufficient to re-&#13;
establish and sustain a totally state-financed health network under the current situation of&#13;
rapidly increasing demand for health care in Viet Nam. Nor would such a system make sense&#13;
in the socio-economic and political conditions that obtain in the 1990's.&#13;
3.          Given that Government policy now sanctions private provision of health care,&#13;
Component 1 does not attempt to reduce the present nor forestall future private sector&#13;
responses to such increasing demand for health care in the growing, modernizing economy.&#13;
While the demand is growing for drugs; for physician--and even more for specialized&#13;
professional services--; for hospitalization; and for various modern treatment modes,&#13;
Component I assumes that they will increasingly be supplied by a dynamically responding&#13;
private health care market.&#13;
4.          Component 1 also does not attempt to use central government financing&#13;
through a national loan-financed project to reduce local governments' investments in public&#13;
health. While the NIHSP will be implemented by the Ministry of Health and financed by a&#13;
Credit to the national government of Viet Nam, the execution and financing of Component I&#13;
in the selected provinces would take into consideration provincial capacities to manage and&#13;
sustain the financing required for continued operations of the facilities that would be improved&#13;
by project investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-                               Annex 2&#13;
What the Package DOES Intend To Do&#13;
5.          First, the package will only be made available to the poorest and least&#13;
developed provinces, districts and communes that had not yet received similar kinds and levels&#13;
of public health investments in the past five years. This means that Component 1 will&#13;
strengthen the public health service delivery capacities precisely in those places whose&#13;
populations have not yet benefited from increased economic activity, higher household&#13;
incomes and vigorous private sector growth that have occurred in other provinces, districts&#13;
and communes of the country.&#13;
6.           Secondly, the package will only strengthen those elements and activities of&#13;
commune and district level public health service outlets which benefit the whole community,&#13;
which private practitioners do not find profitable to provide and for which households are not&#13;
individually willing to pay themselves.&#13;
7.           The Commune Health Centers (CHCs) will be strengthened in their&#13;
capacities for community-wide health activities such as,&#13;
initiating and following up, as appropriate, case finding and case management&#13;
in prevalent infectious and communicable diseases like TB, malaria and ARI,&#13;
the control of which are of national importance,&#13;
provision of appropriate quality maternal and child care, including family&#13;
planning, for which household demand needs to be influenced in ways&#13;
consistent with long term community welfare;&#13;
provision of early first-contact care for common medical problems of the very&#13;
poor who have no means to pay; and&#13;
conduct of activities in IEC, epidemiological monitoring and community&#13;
mobilization for which individuals are not willing to pay but whose social&#13;
benefits exceed their costs.&#13;
8.           The District Health Centers (DHCs) will be strengthened in those technical&#13;
support and managerial functions which are most efficiently shared among a number of CHCs,&#13;
instead of being provided in each single CHC, such as:&#13;
technically competent field supervision whose effectiveness depends on&#13;
coverage wider than one or two communes;&#13;
adequate laboratory and other diagnostic facilities that require higher volumes&#13;
of work for cost efficient operations;&#13;
relatively intensive medical and surgical services required for management of&#13;
hospitalized or serious cases due to infectious and communicable diseases of&#13;
national importance as well as of cases requiring higher level competencies in&#13;
maternal and child health care, including family planning service.&#13;
9.          In addition, the basic clinical credibility and effectiveness of DHCs would be&#13;
enhanced in terms of better emergency care capabilities for management of cases common in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-                                 Annex 2&#13;
the community and of facilities for patient transport, reliable sterile supplies and emergency&#13;
electrical power.&#13;
10.          The Component will support the improvement of DHCs primarily as technical&#13;
support and management command centers for commune level public health operations. The&#13;
improvement of other DHC clinical capabilities as a hospital are being undertaken primarily in&#13;
recognition of the observation that credible and effective leadership and supervision in&#13;
preventive care tends to be done better in tandem with demonstrated ability to render reliable&#13;
and good quality basic curative care.  Another reason for this approach is that in the&#13;
communities selected by the project, it will take some time before adequate private hospitals&#13;
can emerge to meet the health care demands of the population. Meanwhile, it may be possible&#13;
to partially finance the operations of improved public district hospital capabilities by&#13;
implementing equitable user fees on services for which better-off people in the area are willing&#13;
to pay.&#13;
Proposed Criteria for Prioritizing Investments&#13;
11.          In the provinces selected for support by the project, the following proposals&#13;
would be used for determining what Component 1 inputs should be provided to which&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Commune Health Centers&#13;
12.          In general, the package of inputs to be provided should include only those&#13;
necessary for enabling a CHC to function as:&#13;
-     a base for community-wide health activities;&#13;
-     a site for delivering community-level services under the national health&#13;
programs;&#13;
-     the community's focal point for mobilization in preventive and promotive&#13;
activities, and&#13;
-     a source for first-contact care of minor medical problems and for referral of&#13;
possibly more difficult cases.&#13;
13.          The inputs should include some civil works, some minor equipment, some&#13;
drugs and medical supplies, and some staff re-training.&#13;
14.          Civil Works. Investments in civil works should be targeted to assuring a core&#13;
area with minimum enclosed space and facilities adequate for five distinct activities, namely&#13;
a multi-purpose area (useful for activities like immunization sessions, mothers'&#13;
classes, staff meetings, health education sessions) for up to at most 10 adults;&#13;
an examination area for at most two persons;&#13;
a minor surgery/delivery/family planning/treatment area for at most two&#13;
persons;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-                                Annex 2&#13;
-     a post-treatment/observation/recovery/patient waiting area for at most two&#13;
persons; and&#13;
-     a storage area sufficient for CHC stock of supplies and equipment.&#13;
15.          Electrical connections in electrified areas and a source of safe water should&#13;
also be assured.&#13;
(a) It is proposed that civil works investments exclude those CHCs within one hour&#13;
travel time (by normal mode of transport) from the nearest DHC or Provincial&#13;
Hospital.&#13;
(b) It is also proposed that additional civil works beyond the basic model, such as&#13;
additional patient holding or treatment facilities, may be provided for CHCs in&#13;
mountainous areas and those most remote from referral DHCs.&#13;
(c) It is proposed that new CHCs be constructed to replace temporary or completely&#13;
dilapidated ones in mountainous areas and those most remote from referral DHCs&#13;
which have the highest levels of activities and utilization rates in the past three years.&#13;
16.          Equipment. Investments in equipment should be focused on instruments and&#13;
devices, scales, sterilizers, and furniture.&#13;
(a) It is proposed that distribution of equipment be done only to assure that all CHCs&#13;
have the minimum standard list. For those items which are already available and are&#13;
still usable, new or additional ones should not be provided.&#13;
(b) CHCs which may not receive the civil works investments may still receive the&#13;
equipment investments according to need.&#13;
(c) CHCs which perform significantly more than the average CHC--in terms of the&#13;
range or quantity of services rendered, or which serve much larger than average&#13;
populations--may be given additional quantities of equipment items in the standard list.&#13;
17.          Drugs and Medical Supplies. Investments in drugs and medical supplies&#13;
should assure sustained availability of adequate quantities and types needed for first-contact&#13;
care of minor cases, maternal and child health care, family planning, treatment of trachoma&#13;
and common eye diseases, and nutrition and growth monitoring. The standard list of drugs is&#13;
based on quantities appropriate for an average size commune.&#13;
(a) Quantities of drugs and supplies actually distributed to CHCs should consider the&#13;
variations in sizes of populations being covered by different CHCs. Those that serve&#13;
larger than average populations should get more and those with less than average&#13;
populations should get less. But in all cases the types of drugs and supplies provided&#13;
should be maintained.&#13;
(b) CHCs which are receiving similar supplies from other sources should be provided&#13;
additional supplies only up to that level of provision equivalent to all other CHCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-                                Annex 2&#13;
18.         Retraining. The appropriate regularly salaried workers from all CHCs of the&#13;
provinces selected, including those working in CHCs which may not receive any or all of the&#13;
civil works, equipment and drugs inputs, should be re-trained on two basic modules, namely&#13;
the Maternal, Neonatal Care and Family Planning Module and the Endemic Diseases Module.&#13;
(a) CHC workers who are not yet regularly salaried should be re-trained at the time&#13;
when they shall have been absorbed into the government payroll.&#13;
(b) It would be preferred that the re-training activities be timed near, i.e., shortly&#13;
before or after, the period of distributing the equipment and drugs to be provided by&#13;
the project.&#13;
District Health Centers&#13;
19.         In general, the package of inputs for district health centers would be those&#13;
deemed essential to enable them to adequately operate as:&#13;
-     the main source of technical, administrative, financial and logistical support&#13;
services for operations of commune health centers,&#13;
-     the provider of managerial and supervisory direction in the implementation of&#13;
community-level activities under national health programs,&#13;
-     the performer of diagnostic and treatment services and functions required at&#13;
first-referral level supporting implementation of national health programs;&#13;
-     the first option provider of common emergency medical and surgical care and&#13;
hospitalization of the poor.&#13;
These inputs include some civil works, some equipment, some drugs and medical&#13;
supplies, and some re-training of DHC personnel.&#13;
20.          Equipment.   Equipment would  be provided to  meet the minimum&#13;
requirements for hospital-based clinical support of implementing various national health&#13;
programs plus the incremental requirements for securing a safe and functional hospital&#13;
environment. In support of national disease control programs, equipment for services in&#13;
clinical laboratories with public health use, diagnostic X-ray, and operating and delivery rooms&#13;
shall be provided. For adequate general hospital conditions, equipment for central sterile&#13;
supplies, emergency electrical power, and ambulance transport shall be provided.  The&#13;
standard list of equipment is based on quantities appropriate for an average size district.&#13;
It is proposed that DHCs in densely populated areas be provided with more&#13;
complete equipment than those in less densely populated areas. Where the&#13;
probability of high levels of utilization exists, then investments in hospital&#13;
equipment should be made. These areas would have been targeted to receive&#13;
less investments in CHCs. In places where the population is too dispersed to&#13;
use the hospital intensively such as in mountainous and very remote areas, less&#13;
investments in hospital equipment should be made as these areas would have&#13;
already been targeted to receive more investments in CHCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                                Annex 2&#13;
21.          Civil Works.  Investments in equipment shall be the main rationale for&#13;
determining appropriate investments in civil works. Thus, investments in civil works shall be&#13;
provided by the project only up to the level and extent required to properly accommodate and&#13;
adequately operate the equipment provided. At the minimum, only the investments required&#13;
to install the equipment and slightly modify existing spaces would be made. At the maximum,&#13;
the building of a whole diagnostic and treatment block may in rare cases be provided. In most&#13;
cases, only those renovations required for proper X-ray, laboratory, operating and delivery,&#13;
central sterile, emergency power rooms and an ambulance garage would be supported.&#13;
-     Below a certain minimum (see Annex 5), it would be more expedient not to&#13;
include civil works activities under the project and instead require that the&#13;
necessary works be provided by local government authorities as a condition for&#13;
receiving the equipment.&#13;
22.          Drugs.  Investments in drugs will be based on the drugs provided to the&#13;
commune health centers for the reason that the project is not really supporting DHC drug&#13;
requirements in general, but rather drug requirements of commune-level activities that spill&#13;
over to the DHCs.&#13;
It will be necessary for DHCs to establish mechanisms that will ensure the&#13;
appropriate dispensing of these drugs in accordance with the established drug&#13;
use financing policies of the MOH.&#13;
23.          Retraining. Investments in re-training will be provided to all DHCs including&#13;
those not receiving the civil works or equipment inputs. Three modules of re-training will be&#13;
provided to appropriate DHC staff as follows:&#13;
re-training of all users of medical equipment on proper operation and&#13;
preventive maintenance of these equipment;&#13;
skills and techniques required by district supervisors that support commune-&#13;
level operations,&#13;
district managers and department heads will be trained in the management of&#13;
hospital operations and district health center operations.&#13;
&#13;

National Health Support Project&#13;
PROCEDURES FOR THE FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND&#13;
DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS AND EQUIPMENT&#13;
Procurement of Drugs Financed Under NHSP&#13;
1.          The NHSP will finance procurement of three groups of drugs, namely:&#13;
* essential drugs for commune health centers and district health centers under&#13;
Component 1,&#13;
* malaria treatment drugs for the Malaria Control Program;&#13;
* TB and ARI treatment drugs for the TB Control and ARI Control Programs,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
The latter two groups of drugs are included under Component 2 of the project. All&#13;
these drugs will be procured through one central mechanism to be established by the MOH in&#13;
conformity with relevant IDA procurement regulations.&#13;
2.          In order to carry out procurement of drugs, the MOH will formally establish&#13;
the necessary administrative structure and procedures for the conduct of the various stages of&#13;
drug procurement. This structure will provide for, at the minimum, the following tasks to be&#13;
performed by identified and designated groups, units, committees or departments of the&#13;
MOH:&#13;
(a) Drug specification in form, dosage, packaging, and other essential quality&#13;
dimensions. Drug quantity estimation, including proposed allocation of supplies&#13;
by provinces and levels.&#13;
These two tasks are proposed to be done as follows:&#13;
*  For essential drugs of DHCs and CHCs:  a Committee headed by the&#13;
Department of Pharmacy, with the participation of other MOH units involved in&#13;
the MCH-FP, nutrition, trachoma and basic medical care programs.&#13;
*  For malaria drugs and supplies:  a Committee organized by the Malaria&#13;
Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-                               Annex 4&#13;
. For TB and ARI drugs and supplies: a Committee organized by the TB&#13;
Institute.&#13;
It is emphasized that the technical specifications should include all the relevant&#13;
standard provisions of the IDA-approved bidding documents, and that only those&#13;
technical specifications explicitly stated can be used as the basis of technical&#13;
evaluations.&#13;
(b) Bidding and procurement processing: This is proposed to be done via an&#13;
existing entity with experience in tender processing and other administrative as well&#13;
Bank procedures.&#13;
(c) Technical evaluation of bids or offers: The organizations and groups responsible&#13;
for technical specifications and quantity estimation (as described in (a) above) shall be&#13;
responsible for undertaking the technical evaluation and preparing the findings on the&#13;
technical responsiveness of the offers received.&#13;
(d) Awarding and contracting the procurement: The recommendation to award&#13;
the contract based on the technical findings and financial evaluation will be done by an&#13;
ad hoc committee designated by the Minister of Health for this purpose.  The&#13;
recommendation will be submitted to IDA for review, and upon approval, contracting&#13;
shall then proceed.&#13;
(e) Testing of deliveries, acceptance, and authorization for payment: Procedures&#13;
for pre-shipment inspection, manufacturer's certification, and in-country inspection as&#13;
appropriate will be provided in order to ascertain the compliance of the actual&#13;
deliveries of drugs according to what was specified, offered and contracted. This is&#13;
proposed to be done by a designated group of the MOH which shall supervise the&#13;
performance of specific evaluation steps for testing and accepting drug supply&#13;
deliveries.&#13;
(f) Consignment of drug deliveries to final end users: This is proposed to be done&#13;
by the same groups designated to perform the tasks identified in (a) above.&#13;
(g) Monitoring of drug issue, consumption and stock: A system of confirmation of&#13;
receipt of drug deliveries and supervision of actual flow of goods shall be set up and&#13;
supervised by the PMU, in cooperation with the Department of Pharmacy. Similar&#13;
mechanisms will be established for monitoring the flow of malaria, TB and ARI drugs.&#13;
3.           The rules and procedures for drug procurement shall be in conformity with the&#13;
country's laws and the IDA procurement regulations. The actual rules and regulations for&#13;
NHSP drug procurement will recognize the fact that compliance with currently implemented&#13;
drug regulations in Viet Nam alone may not be sufficient to ensure that drugs procured under&#13;
these regulations will be of adequate quality. Thus, in addition to satisfying relevant existing&#13;
drug regulations, such as current drug registration and supplier licensing, the procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-                               Annex 4&#13;
rules will apply other measures to control the quality of the drugs procured under the project.&#13;
These measures shall include adherence to GMIP standards, and the WHO system of&#13;
certification from country of origin, among other conditions explicitly provided in the IDA-&#13;
approved bidding documents.&#13;
4.           The MOH has indicated its intention to apply the relevant provisions of its&#13;
forthcoming national drug policy on the drug procurement under this project. These may&#13;
include, among others, an exclusive essential drug list, generic labeling of drug products,&#13;
application of GMP in manufacture of drugs to be procured, practice of rational drug use&#13;
according to treatment guidelines. Prior to doing so, these policies will be communicated to&#13;
IDA for consideration as to whether any of these policies are incompatible with World Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines. Some policies such as exclusive preference for domestic suppliers or&#13;
requiring pre-registration of drug products being procured may not be consistent with IDA&#13;
procurement regulations.&#13;
5.           An appropriate MOH decision or order stating these structures and procedures&#13;
governing drug procurement, among others, shall be an essential requirement to be met before&#13;
the project could be implemented.&#13;
Distribution of Drugs to be Procured&#13;
6.           Management of Commodities Distribution. Drugs and equipment procured&#13;
under the NHSP shall be distributed through arrangements established by the MOH as the&#13;
nodal service ministry that must ensure that these are supplied to user points at pre-&#13;
determined intervals and also ensure that suitable mechanisms are in place to ensure the&#13;
smooth, transparent and continuous flow of supplies. Towards this end, the following actions&#13;
will be taken:&#13;
(a) Due to the large volumes involved and the differing requirements of&#13;
delivery and follow-up action, separate logistics systems will be set up for&#13;
drugs and equipment.&#13;
(b) For drugs, MOH will establish the following arrangements:&#13;
(i) For Malaria, TB, and ARI control drugs, MOH will provide limited&#13;
support for port clearance and thereafter hand over delivered supplies to&#13;
the appropriate Institute for distribution through the existing vertical&#13;
channels for these control programs. Due to possible storage capacity&#13;
constraints at the Institutes, the central warehouses will hold stocks only on&#13;
request for a short period and will hand these over to the Institutes as and&#13;
when requested.&#13;
(ii) For essential drugs, MOH will arrange for a service contract for drug&#13;
distribution with three pharmaceutical companies, the details of which are&#13;
discussed in para. 7 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-                               Annex 4&#13;
(iii) All imported drugs will arrive at Haiphong. The MOH warehouse will&#13;
be used as a holding and transit facility. The port clearance and transfer of&#13;
stocks to the Malaria, TB, and ARI Institutes and the three pharmaceutical&#13;
companies will be contracted out through competitive bidding to private&#13;
contractors who specialize in clearing and forwarding activity.&#13;
(iv) For equipment, MOH will arrange for a distribution, installation, and&#13;
maintenance contract with three medical equipment companies, the details&#13;
of which are discussed in para. 13 below.&#13;
7.           In-Country Handling of Essential Drugs: Pharmaceutical company Number&#13;
1 at Hanoi, Number 2 at Ho Chi Minh City and Danang Central Company have adequate&#13;
capacity, infrastructure and manpower to handle the in-country storage and distribution of the&#13;
volumes and variety of essential drugs to be procured under the NHSP. These companies'&#13;
central warehouses had been handling drug supplies for the entire country before&#13;
liberalization. Furthermore, these central stores were further modernized in the early 1970's&#13;
under the SIDA Provision of Drugs Program.&#13;
8.           MOH intends to enter into a contractual arrangement with these entities for&#13;
providing the logistics support for both projects on agreed/negotiated service charges. These&#13;
companies will be contracted to be responsible for:&#13;
(a) Warehousing, storage, and accounting of all drugs procured under the&#13;
project;&#13;
(b) Inventory control and management;&#13;
(c) Physical distribution as per plans provided by the Pharmacy Department;&#13;
(d) Providing periodic reports of actual distribution and stock holding,&#13;
including exceptions, etc.&#13;
9.           Physical Distribution of Drugs from  the Center to DHCs and CHCs.&#13;
Since all drugs are meant to be supplied to district health centers and then to commune health&#13;
centers, the contracted companies will make direct deliveries to districts at frequent intervals&#13;
either using their own transport or private transport. The Provincial Health Bureau, through&#13;
its provincial NHSP-PMU, will prepare and approve the district and commune drug supply&#13;
distribution plans on which these deliveries will be based.  As deliveries are made, the&#13;
distribution contractor shall provide the provincial authorities with actual supply reports on a&#13;
regular basis. Intermediate provincial storage and subsequent transfer to districts has been&#13;
ruled out as this will add another step with consequent delays, possible losses and additional&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-                               Annex 4&#13;
10.          This system of delivery will first be pilot tested in the provinces covered by two&#13;
central warehouses together with a comparative system in the other central warehouse which&#13;
would deliver to the provinces instead of direct deliveries to the districts. Evaluation of this&#13;
pilot will be undertaken after the first year. Recommendations from the evaluation will be the&#13;
basis for the system of distribution for the rest of the project life.&#13;
11.         The NHSP essential drugs will be delivered to district stores which have&#13;
adequate capacity for storage of the expected quantities provided under the project. Thus,&#13;
supplies to districts need only be made on a quarterly or semester basis. Distribution from&#13;
districts to CHCs will be done via the current monthly collection system by the CHC staff&#13;
when visiting the district for monthly meetings or when collecting their salaries. The volumes&#13;
per CHC are not large, storage capacity at CHCs are limited, and monthly rather than&#13;
quarterly allocations are probably better for control purposes.&#13;
12.          Separation of Free Drugs from Drugs for Sale. The contracted companies&#13;
are currently handling drugs for sale and they will also be handling these project-financed&#13;
drugs which are to be supplied free of charge to patients. Thus the MOH will require that the&#13;
contractor will physically segregate the stocks of project-financed drugs and maintain separate&#13;
stock accounts for receipt and issue, which will be subject to audit.&#13;
13.          Physical Distribution and Installation of Equipment.  MOH intends to&#13;
enter into contracts with Medinsco at Hanoi, Vimec at Ho Chi Minh City and the Danang&#13;
Equipment Store at a negotiated service charge for storage, distribution, installation and&#13;
maintenance of equipment supplied under the project.  These companies have adequate&#13;
storage capacity and staff and have the experience of handling and distributing UNFPA&#13;
supplied equipment, in addition to having received assistance for upgrading and modernization&#13;
from this donor. These companies will also be required to maintain separate segmented areas&#13;
for storage and separate segmented stocks and issue accounts for project-funded equipment&#13;
apart from their commercial operations.&#13;
14.          As is the case with drugs, the distribution plan for equipment among DHCs and&#13;
CHCs shall be prepared and approved by the Provincial Health Bureau, through their&#13;
provincial NHSP-PMU. But the contracted companies will supply the equipment direct to&#13;
DHCs, with subsequent distribution to CHCs within the districts. Information about the&#13;
receipt of these equipment will be provided to the provincial authorities.&#13;
15.          Estimates of the Costs of Distribution. A budgetary estimate equivalent to&#13;
7.5% of the CIF costs of drugs and equipment is included in the project costs. This estimate&#13;
is based on international experience in inward distribution. The actual costs or charges shall&#13;
have to be negotiated by the MOH with these companies.&#13;
16.          Financing of Service Contract Costs. The costs of the service contracts for&#13;
the in-country warehousing, storing, handling, distributing and accounting for the project-&#13;
financed drugs and equipment shall be borne by the Government as part of its project&#13;
counterpart costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-                               Annex 4&#13;
Project Financing of Drug Procurement and Distribution&#13;
17.          Project credit funds shall finance drugs included in the project and procured in&#13;
accordance with IDA regulations. Government counterpart funds will finance the service&#13;
contracts for distribution.&#13;
Financial Terms for the Dispensing of Project-Financed Drugs&#13;
18.          Under the terms of an existing Government decree, the drugs provided under&#13;
the project for the malaria, TB and ARI programs shall be dispensed to people for free. This&#13;
is also true for people living in mountainous and remote areas with respect to the approved&#13;
essential drugs listed in Annex 4 for CHCs and DHCs. These drugs are for communicable&#13;
diseases like malaria, TB, and ARI, or are essential drugs for pregnant women, children and&#13;
the poor. Adjustment in quantities favoring poorer communes may be made during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
19.         In order to fully implement the policy of not charging for utilization of these&#13;
particular drugs, the following measures shall be taken by the MOH:&#13;
(a) The regulations on dispensing the drugs included in the approved drug list for&#13;
CHCs and DHCs without charge shall be issued and given wide publicity, at the time&#13;
drug supplies under the project shall have started to flow.&#13;
(b) In the 15 provinces covered by Component 1, the Provincial People's Committees&#13;
shall be requested by the MOH to issue their own regulation on dispensing those drugs&#13;
in the approved drug list for CHCs and DHCs without charge. The rationale for the&#13;
policy on why these drugs in the list are provided free, while other drugs not on the list&#13;
are being sold, will be adequately explained to the People's Committees.&#13;
(c) Packing of drugs procured and distributed under the project shall be clearly&#13;
marked: "Not for Sale, To be Dispensed Without Charge", or similar words to that&#13;
effect. In addition, drugs provided in large volumes and with relatively high unit costs&#13;
shall be identified by unique markings on the tablets, vials, tubes or individual pieces of&#13;
the drugs. These markings will permit the monitoring of actual dispensing and use.&#13;
(d) The policy of dispensing without charge the drugs in the CHC and DHC drug list&#13;
in mountainous and remote areas and in the malaria, TB and ART programs, while&#13;
other drugs continue to be sold, shall be clearly explained and included in all health&#13;
worker training undertaken under the project.&#13;
(e) Compliance with the policy of dispensing project financed drugs without charge&#13;
shall be part of the supervision in CHCs by district supervisors. The health facility&#13;
records shall include prescriptions and dispensing by the health workers and&#13;
acknowledgment of receipt of drugs by the patients. Such records will be regularly&#13;
inspected by supervisors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-                               Annex 4&#13;
(f) Continued supply of drugs under the project from the MOH to the provinces will&#13;
be based on the provinces' compliance with all their responsibilities for assuring that&#13;
CHCs and DHCs are dispensing these drugs without charge, in those areas where&#13;
applicable.&#13;
(g) The system of distribution of project-financed drugs, particularly when such system&#13;
may also handle drugs for sale, shall clearly describe the measures for preventing free&#13;
drugs from being sold. For some drugs included in the project which are also being&#13;
sold for other indications. e.g., some of the antibiotics for TB or ARI, stocks for sale&#13;
and stocks to be dispensed without charge should be clearly separated. At the DHCs,&#13;
issuance of drugs for sale and free drugs shall be at different points for dispensing&#13;
under these two different financing conditions.&#13;
Sustaining the Financing of Drug Supply&#13;
20.          Sustaining the financing of drugs being sold in the public sector is not a&#13;
problem. Drug selling in the public sector has many problems but sustained financing is not&#13;
one of them. The issue of financial sustainability in the project involves the provision of&#13;
certain drugs to certain people without charge. Controlling prevalent communicable diseases&#13;
like malaria, TB and ARI as well as improving the basic health of the poor and of children&#13;
require that adequate supply of drugs be made available to them at CHCs and DHCs without&#13;
charge.  Charging for these drugs could compromise the disease control and health&#13;
improvement objectives of the project; on the other hand, not charging for these drugs may&#13;
compromise the Government's ability to financially sustain the supply of these drugs over the&#13;
long term. Thus the specific sustainability issue is: how can the Government sustain levels of&#13;
financing in order to adequately supply those few drugs that need to be dispensed without&#13;
charge for some purposes to some groups in the population so that its disease control and&#13;
health improvement objectives can be met?&#13;
21.          Based on projections of the malaria, TB and ARI programs, successful disease&#13;
control efforts should reduce the extent of these disease problems over time. Thus in terms of&#13;
financing of drugs for these programs, the requirements will eventually decline with&#13;
progressive successes in disease control.&#13;
22.          For other essential drugs for the poor, continued financing through&#13;
Government revenues is being proposed in certain circumstances. Over the life of the project,&#13;
public expenditures analysis and private sector mobilization under Component 3 will identify&#13;
areas of current Government health activities where possible shifts from public financing to&#13;
private financing are desirable. Resources thus freed up could then be used to sustain the&#13;
financing of provision of essential drugs to the poor. This will be one of the specific&#13;
objectives of Component 3, i.e. to identify sources of financing within the current and future&#13;
pattern of public expenditures that may be more efficiently and even equitably replaced by&#13;
private financing, and may then be used to sustain the project's financing of essential drugs to&#13;
the poor.&#13;
&#13;

communicable diseases like malaria, TB and ARI, and to protect the health of the poor now&#13;
and in the immediate seven years, in anticipation of further economic growth that can generate&#13;
sufficient incremental public resources for sustaining a possibly much reduced prevalent&#13;
disease control burden, while also making possible some adjustments in current public health&#13;
expenditure patterns.&#13;

of this sub-component, the following general policies will be adopted:&#13;
1.    Technical Direction By A Module Task Force&#13;
For each module, a task force will provide technical direction in the development and&#13;
implementation of the module. The composition of the task force will be determined on the&#13;
following basis:&#13;
(a) Persons representing institutions with mandates relevant to the training module;&#13;
with technical expertise in the content of the module or the methods of training; and&#13;
who are familiar with the practical conditions of the field, understand and accept the&#13;
value of good quality training; and have the time and energy to get involved in the&#13;
activities of the task force.&#13;
(b) For reasons of convenience, members of the task force will come from around&#13;
Hanoi. However, attention shall be given to include periodic consultations with&#13;
persons who come from other parts of the country, particularly the South and Center.&#13;
Persons in this category shall also be identified and included as consulting members of&#13;
the task force.&#13;
1 A detailed description of the content of each module as well as how it will be developed and&#13;
implemented is available in the project files.&#13;

(c) Members of the task force should in general not be involved in conducting the&#13;
training, although one or two of its members may also be engaged as a master trainer.&#13;
This will insure that the task force effectively oversees the development of the module.&#13;
2.    Technical Support by Identified Institutions for Each Module&#13;
(a) The costs for the operations of the task force shall be included in the contract to&#13;
the institution that shall serve as the base for module development. The following&#13;
institutions have been tentatively identified:&#13;
Module I-   Institute for the Protection of Mothers and Newborn and Institute for&#13;
the Protection of Child Health&#13;
Module 2 and 4-Ha Tay Secondary Medical School&#13;
Module 3-   Institute of Medical Equipment or Medical Technician College&#13;
Module 5-   School of Public Health.&#13;
(b) Each of the above institutions will be supported to maintain a small secretariat or&#13;
administrative unit to sustain the activities of the task force, assist the master trainers&#13;
who are developing the module, and provide a venue for the activities of module&#13;
development.&#13;
3.    Master Trainers to Serve as Module Developers&#13;
(a) For each module a number of master trainers have been identified who will&#13;
perform the following functions:&#13;
-Conduct the training needs assessments;&#13;
-Contribute to designing the module curriculum;&#13;
-Prepare the prototype reference, teaching and learning materials;&#13;
-Pre-test the module design and materials;&#13;

-Supervise and monitor the actual training, including conduct of some of the&#13;
training;&#13;
-Evaluate the training outcomes and prepare recommendations on module&#13;
revisions;&#13;
-Receive and work with foreign consultants involved in the training.&#13;
(b) Master trainers will be engaged as local consultants on a part-time or full-time&#13;
basis depending on the needs of the module at different stages of project&#13;
implementation. The costs for keeping the master trainers involved shall be included in&#13;
the contract of the institutional base of the module.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

National Health Support Project&#13;
SUPPORT TO NATIONAL DISEASE CONTROL PROGRAMS&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The disease control component of the National Health Support Project would include&#13;
program support for the National Malaria Control Program, National Tuberculosis Control&#13;
Program and the Acute Respiratory Infections Program. The component would be&#13;
implemented by the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology and by&#13;
the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases through existing&#13;
organizational channels.&#13;
RATIONALE FOR SUPPORTING THESE PROGRAMS:&#13;
* The three diseases have been selected as priority public health concerns by the&#13;
Government because communicable and infectious diseases still pose an intolerable&#13;
burden on the health of the population and a substantial drain on economic resources.&#13;
The burden of disease falls disproportionately on the poor. Furthermore, their control&#13;
is necessarily in the public domain forming an essential part of public health activities&#13;
in the country. The three diseases are of particular high priority for the reasons&#13;
detailed below.&#13;
After years of effective control, malaria has had a resurgence in recent years, with the&#13;
number of deaths reaching 4,646 in 1991, the highest number ever recorded. This&#13;
worsening of the situation was primarily due to the under-financing of the National&#13;
Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and was compounded by the changing&#13;
epidemiological situation, serious problems of resistance to drugs and decline in&#13;
general health services. Although mortality has been steadily reduced in the past two&#13;
years, the risk of malaria continues to be a fundamental threat for about 35 million&#13;
Vietnamese.  Hence, protection from this risk of malaria for the population is&#13;
imperative.&#13;
* Tuberculosis is a less dramatic and visible disease in Viet Nam, though it is the second&#13;
major public health problem following malaria. Annually, more than 50,000 new&#13;
infectious cases occur, most of whom would die without proper treatment. Moreover,&#13;
these patients infect annually more than one million Vietnamese citizens.  With&#13;
systematic treatment it is now not only possible to prevent the mortality caused by&#13;
tuberculosis but also, and most importantly, to gradually reduce transmission of&#13;
the disease. This would result in fewer new cases per year, and such a gain in&#13;
tuberculosis control is long-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-                               Annex 7&#13;
* Acute respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia, is the single most important&#13;
killer of children under 5. While a program to control ARI is gradually being put in&#13;
place, it presently reaches only half the children in need.&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF THE SUB-COMPONENTS:&#13;
Malaria Control sub-component:&#13;
Objective:         To reduce malaria mortality, morbidity and its social and economic&#13;
impact in Viet Nam.&#13;
To strengthen national and local capabilities for sustainable malaria&#13;
control.&#13;
Main Inputs:       Insecticides, equipment, means of transport, training, IEC, program&#13;
support.&#13;
Indicators:        Prevalence, mortality&#13;
Main Outcomes:    Coverage of all populations at high malaria risk by locally effective&#13;
anti-vector measures, with emphasis on impregnated bednets; early&#13;
diagnosis and treatment, improved program management including&#13;
better epidemiological services, training, supervision, communication&#13;
and program related applied field research.&#13;
Benefits:          Improved health status for the approximately 35 million people in Viet&#13;
Nam at risk of malaria, in particular the 15 million exposed to yearly&#13;
intense malaria transmission.&#13;
Reduction of risk of unmanageable multiple drug resistance partially&#13;
caused by the unregulated private pharmaceutical market.&#13;
Increased socio-economic development opportunities in malarious&#13;
areas.&#13;
Implementation:    National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology.&#13;
Risks:             There is a distinct risk that the attainment of a level of malaria control&#13;
cannot be sustained after project termination. However, with the social&#13;
and economic development in Viet Nam continuing at the current pace,&#13;
such a scenario does not seem probable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-                                 Annex 7&#13;
Tuberculosis Control sub-component:&#13;
Objectives:         To reduce tuberculosis incidence, mortality and morbidity including the&#13;
psycho-social suffering caused by the disease.&#13;
Indicators:         Case-finding rate, cure rate, number of districts on short-course&#13;
chemotherapy.&#13;
Main Inputs:        Drugs, equipment, transport, training and operations support.&#13;
Main Outcomes:      Reduction in tuberculosis incidence and mortality through attainment of&#13;
a case finding rate of 70% of new infectious patients and cure of 85%&#13;
of all patients enrolled in chemotherapy.&#13;
Benefits:           Reduced tuberculosis incidence in the general population.&#13;
Cure of infected patients.&#13;
Implementation:     National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases.&#13;
Risks:              A major risk is always insufficient compliance (patients under treatment&#13;
dropping out) resulting in a very slow decrease of the incidence of&#13;
tuberculosis in the general population. This risk can be mitigated by&#13;
careful patient follow-up.&#13;
ARI Control Program sub-component&#13;
Objectives:         To provide the national ARI program funds to purchase additional&#13;
drugs and supplies in order to achieve its coverage objectives. The&#13;
objective under this sub-component is limited since UNICEF provides&#13;
major assistance to the ARI program, covering most development and&#13;
program costs.&#13;
Indicators:        Pneumonia cases treated.&#13;
Main Inputs:        Antibiotics, equipment, training and program support.&#13;
Main Outcome:       Extend coverage under the ARI program to 100% of children under&#13;
five by the year 1999.&#13;
Benefits:           Reduction in the mortality of ARI among children and improved&#13;
health status in this group.&#13;
Implementation:    National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases.&#13;
Risks:              A major risk is the limited absorptive capacity at the CHC level, which&#13;
is the level at which the interventions will be targeted. Also, wastage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-                                Annex 7&#13;
of drugs is an on-going concern and this would require standard ARI&#13;
case management and careful drug management.&#13;
ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED DURING IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
The proposed control strategies for the three programs are technically sound.&#13;
However, the following issues will need to be addressed during implementation:&#13;
For malaria:&#13;
* establishment of ecological and occupational patterns to better target control&#13;
* agreement to provide bednets free of charge&#13;
* review of antimalarial drug use and disease management in the private sector and&#13;
development of an action plan to influence private sector use of antimalarials&#13;
* establishment of a small research steering committee&#13;
For tuberculosis:&#13;
-  review and establishment of criteria for introduction of short course chemotherapy&#13;
(six months)&#13;
-  establishment of dosages for introduction of blister packs for short course&#13;
chemotherapy&#13;
- undertake tuberculin survey in selected provinces to measure impact&#13;
- review anti-tuberculosis drug use in the private sector and develop an action&#13;
program&#13;
For ARI&#13;
*   study drug resistance to co-trimoxazol&#13;

and efficiently. He is the official mainly accountable for the timely and adequate execution of&#13;
the approved program of work for the project.&#13;
2.    Lead Persons for Component 1: The various activities of Component 1 would be&#13;
implemented by the respective departments, e.g., civil works by the Department of Medical&#13;
Equipment and Construction. However, there is a need for coordination across departments&#13;
for certain aspects of project implementation. Thus, this Lead Person would be the MOH&#13;
executive assigned by the Minister of Health to coordinate the implementation of Component&#13;
1, which provides support to commune health centers and district health centers in selected&#13;
provinces. He chairs a committee to be created under the project composed of representatives&#13;
of the MOH Departments of Medical Equipment and Construction, Science and Training and&#13;
Pharmacy, plus representatives from provincial health departments of the 15 project&#13;
provinces.  This committee is responsible for preparing recommendations and proposed&#13;
instructions on the implementation of Component 1 activities that involve cross-departmental&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
3.    Lead Person for Component 3: The MOH executive assigned by the Minister of&#13;
Health to coordinate the implementation of Component 3, providing support to planning and&#13;
management in the Ministry of Health. He chairs the committee to be created under the&#13;
project composed of representatives of the MOH Departments of Planning and Finance,&#13;
Treatment and Health Statistics Unit, plus representatives of other relevant units.  This&#13;
committee is responsible for preparing recommendations and proposed instructions on the&#13;
implementation of Component 3 activities that involve cross-departmental responsibilities.&#13;
4.    Provincial Project Manager (in selected provinces): The provincial health service&#13;
executive, other than the provincial health service director, who shall be designated to serve as&#13;
the person whose primary task is to assist the provincial health service director in coordinating&#13;
NHSP activities involving the province, its districts and communes.  On behalf of the&#13;
provincial director, he will relate to heads of units in the provincial health department, and&#13;
district health directors concerned to ensure proper implementation of NHSP activities in the&#13;

Functions of the Project Management Unit&#13;
16.   The Project Management Unit is the staff organized specifically to support all units of&#13;
the MOH and provincial health departments assigned to implement the NHSP. The PMU&#13;
does not implement the NHSP; it supports, assists, collaborates with, coordinates with, and&#13;
facilitates the work of, those regular and ad hoc government bodies assigned by the Minister&#13;
to implement the project.&#13;
17.   The PMU has the following functions:&#13;
In Relation to the MOH Implementing Units&#13;
(a) Assists them in preparing their respective annual project implementation plans and&#13;
proposed project budgets;&#13;
(b) Consolidates proposed plans and budgets into an overall project plan and budget&#13;
for approval by the Minister;&#13;
(c) Coordinates with the MOH and MOF units responsible for releasing project funds&#13;
to insure that implementing units have funds to undertake their planned activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Specific Authorities Needed by the PMU to Effectively Coordinate Project&#13;
Implementation&#13;
If the PMU is to effectively carry out the above functions, it requires the following&#13;
authorities.&#13;
18.   Authority to issue annual planning and budget guidelines to be used by the&#13;
provinces, institutes and departments as the basis of their annual project plan&#13;
and budget.&#13;
Explanatory Note: Before the start of each year of project implementation, the PMU&#13;
will determine the overall scope and level of activities that are targeted to be&#13;
accomplished by the project for that year. This is reflected in the sequence of activities&#13;
as well as in the targeted level of project disbursements described in the Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report. This would usually be discussed by the Project Steering Committee,&#13;
and the resulting detailed guidelines on project priorities, project budget ceilings per&#13;
component or sub-component, and physical targets for the year would be issued to the&#13;
implementing units.&#13;
19.   Authority to consolidate all the component and sub-component plans and&#13;
budgets for the whole project and submit the final annual project plan and&#13;
budget to Government and IDA.&#13;
Explanatory Note: Based on the annual project plan and budget guidelines, each&#13;
province, institute and department involved will prepare their respective plan and&#13;
budget. These will be consolidated by the PMU and technically reviewed by ad hoc&#13;
committees it may organize. From these reviews, the PMU will identify issues for&#13;
resolution. Examples of issues would be: level of activity or funding required by an&#13;
implementing unit is higher or lower than what has been programmed; there are&#13;
problems with the technical approach proposed; there are conflicts in timing or&#13;
scheduling of activities; matching resources outside the project needed to achieve the&#13;
goals are not available; there are new ideas that have emerged since the project was&#13;
designed; etc. These issues are presented for resolution by the Steering Committee&#13;
and the decisions are implemented by the PMU in the consolidated project plan and&#13;
budget that it submits to other authorities.&#13;
20.   Authority to allocate fund releases to various project activities and implementing&#13;
units.&#13;
Explanatory Note: While the approved annual plan and budget would normally have&#13;
the total funding required from the credit proceeds and from the Govemment&#13;
counterpart, actual releases at any time may be less than the total required. In these&#13;
cases, the PMU will have to prioritize which activities will go first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87-                                Annex 10&#13;
21.  Authority to re-allocate fund releases from slower moving activities to faster&#13;
moving ones.&#13;
Explanatory Note: The PMU initially decides to set aside funds for certain activities to&#13;
proceed based on their expectation of implementation efficiency. But if other activities&#13;
move faster and thus need more resources, the PMU can allocate additional project&#13;
resources or re-allocate existing resources provided these are all within the annual plan&#13;
and budget.&#13;
22.   Authority to approve technical specifications for procurement and activity&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Explanatory Note: All contracts and expenditures paid from project funds will be&#13;
governed by technical specifications or descriptions developed by one unit of the&#13;
MOH or another. These specifications can include: type, dosage, or form of drugs;&#13;
type, make, critical performance criteria for equipment; scope of work and level of&#13;
effort of consultants; type of paper and binding for printed materials; number of&#13;
participants, duration and per diem rates for re-training; sample size and methodology&#13;
of surveys; etc. For all these specifications, the PMU should have final authority to&#13;
approve before these are sent to IDA for no objections review as necessary.&#13;
23.   Authority to approve contracts up to a certain amount.&#13;
Explanatory Note: Project contracts of some amount should be within the authority of&#13;
the PMU to approve for speed and efficiency in implementation.&#13;
24.   Authority to approve consultant selection.&#13;
Explanatory Note: Consultants to be contracted under the project shall be procured in&#13;
accordance with IDA regulations. The final selection shall be communicated by the&#13;
PMN  to IDA for no objection review, as necessary.&#13;
25.   Exclusive authority to communicate on official project matters with IDA.&#13;
Explanatory Note: The MOH will communicate with the IDA through the PMU. All&#13;
communications of provinces, institutes, and departments of the MOH regarding the&#13;
project will be coursed to the PMU and all IDA responses will be received and&#13;
transmitted to those concerned by the PMU. This will cover all bid documents,&#13;
contracts, specifications, and plans for review; all statements of expenditures, requests&#13;
and reports on financial transactions; all technical information and issues; and all&#13;
requirements for legal compliance.&#13;
26. Authority to decide on commodity distribution plans, choices of CHCs and DHCs&#13;
to include, and levels of activities in each geographic area.&#13;
Explanatory Note: In the course of project implementation, the distribution of project&#13;
benefits will be affected by the actual distribution for project inputs. The PMU should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-88-                               Annex 10&#13;
have the authority to finally approve the actual specific targeting of project inputs&#13;
during implementation in order to ensure that implementation adheres to the project&#13;
objectives and goals.&#13;
27. Authority to resolve technical disagreements among MOH departments as well as&#13;
between MOH departments and provinces.&#13;
Explanatory Note: There will be occasions when various units involved in the project&#13;
may not agree on technical issues. E.g., Malaria and TB programs would like to&#13;
conduct their own training; the re-training modules would like to integrate malaria and&#13;
TB training into one module. The DMEC would like to include provincial technicians&#13;
and engineers in the equipment training; DST wants to cover only the district-level&#13;
personnel. A province would like to modify the criteria for selecting CHCs for civil&#13;
works; DMEC would like to keep the criteria uniform. All these issues are examples&#13;
of technical disagreements for which the PMU should have the authority to resolve, by&#13;
itself or though the Steering Committee, or though another mechanism that it sets up.&#13;
28. Authority to request withdrawals from the Project Special Account and the fund&#13;
for Government counterpart to the project.&#13;
Explanatory Note:  This represents the act of disbursement for duly authorized&#13;
expenditures, and is therefore essential to project coordination.&#13;
29. Authority to submit official reports on the project.&#13;
Explanatory Note: The PMIU should be the source of all reports on the project.&#13;
30. Authority to maintain an account for PMU operations, authorize expenditures&#13;
charged to this account, authorize domestic travel of PMU personnel on project-&#13;
related matters.&#13;
Explanatory Note: The PMU should have a measure of autonomy in order to perform&#13;
its tasks.&#13;
31.  Authority to create ad hoc committees or work groups drawn from  the&#13;
implementing units of the project.&#13;
Explanatory Note: The PMU will identify from time to time various specific issues in&#13;
project implementation that require discussion and decision by various groups in the&#13;
project. The PMU should have the authority to set up committees and task forces to&#13;
deal with these issues.&#13;
&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
National Health Support Project&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
1.           The NHSP may be considered a set of inputs (drugs, equipment, civil works,&#13;
technical assistance) designed to allow a particular set of activities (service delivery, policy&#13;
work) to be undertaken to realize a set of outcomes (greater utilization of services, expanded&#13;
coverage by disease control programs, policy reforms)  that would lead eventually to&#13;
beneficial impacts on health status (reduced morbidity and mortality).&#13;
2.           With regard to project inputs, performance indicators should help determine&#13;
whether resources are adequate, readily available and economical. With regard to activities&#13;
undertaken by the project, performance indicators should help determine whether these&#13;
activities are completed as scheduled, effectively utilized and well targeted. With regard to&#13;
outcomes, indicators should be able to identify whether outcomes have indeed occurred, what&#13;
benefits were generated and to whom the benefits accrued. Finally, performance indicators&#13;
should help establish the overall impact on health status.   Thus, performance indicators&#13;
should answer the following basic questions: (1) were the resources adequate?; (2) were the&#13;
resources effectively applied?; (3) did the application of resources improve service delivery&#13;
and utilization? and (4) did all these lead to improvements in health status?&#13;
3.           Given the basic project strategy and the design of its components, the&#13;
following 14 performance indicators will be monitored. Indicators I-V are measures of&#13;
achievement of Objective 1 of the project, indicators VI-XI of Objective 2, and indicators MI&#13;
and XIV of Objective 3 (see Table 11.1). The remaining indicators provide measures of the&#13;
effectiveness of project management. It should be noted that the MOH already routinely&#13;
collects, and will continue to collect, data nationwide on morbidity and mortality for the basic&#13;
diseases of concern to the project, i.e., basic measures of health status. Thus, the indicators&#13;
listed below primarily concentrate on measures of inputs, activities and outputs.&#13;
I. Number of CHCs Improved as a Proportion of Total CHCs Targeted&#13;
4.           "Improved CHCs" are defined as those Commune Health Centers whose staff&#13;
has been trained on MCH-FP and endemic diseases, which have received the basic set of&#13;
equipment, are receiving a regular supply of essential drugs, are being regularly supervised by&#13;
district supervisors and whose facility is deemed physically adequate (new, repaired, upgraded&#13;
or replaced). The project targets the improvement of 2,819 CHCs in 15 provinces. This&#13;
indicator monitors the progress with which separate streams of investments in training,&#13;
equipment and drug supply, civil works and supervision come together in individual CHCs. In&#13;
addition to monitoring the progress of these activities as part of specific input indicators, the&#13;
individual CHCs will be tagged and the coming together of all the provisions reported and&#13;
monitored. The source of data will be individual facility reports validated by a supervisor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-                              Annex 11&#13;
from the provincial PMU. This indicator measures the extent of implementation of the&#13;
strengthening of the primary health care infrastructure in the target provinces.&#13;
II. Number of Improved DHCs as a Proportion of Total DHCs Targeted&#13;
5.          'Improved DHCs" are defined as District Health Centers whose staff have&#13;
been trained in equipment operation, field supervision and hospital management; have received&#13;
the basic equipment; are receiving regular supply of essential drugs; and whose building has&#13;
been repaired to accommodate the equipment. The project targets the improvement of 155&#13;
DHCs in 15 provinces. This indicator monitors the progress with which separate streams of&#13;
essential inputs are assembled in one service facility. The source of data will be individual&#13;
facility reports validated by a supervisor from the provincial PMU. This indicator measures&#13;
the extent of implementation of the strengthening of the primary health care infrastructure, of&#13;
which the DHC is a key technical support.&#13;
Ifl. Utilization of CHCs&#13;
6.          'Utilization" will be defined using three index services being provided by the&#13;
CHC, namely: delivery; outpatient clinic visit; and well-baby care visit. District supervisors&#13;
will maintain a monthly log of total numbers of these three index services for each of the&#13;
CHCs they regularly supervise. In the first year of the project, the utilization thus recorded&#13;
would serve as the baseline. As the various inputs to CHCs and their supporting DHCs are&#13;
provided and improvements of these facilities are completed, the recorded utilization will be&#13;
summarized by districts and consolidated by the provincial PMU.  Annual analysis of&#13;
utilization for CHCs of various conditions (improved CHC, partially improved CHC,&#13;
unimproved CHC paired with combinations of improved DHC, partially improved DHC and&#13;
unimproved DHC) would be undertaken by the NHSP-PMU. This indicator measures the&#13;
extent to which the community utilizes the appropriate and essential CHC services.&#13;
IV, V. Infant Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Rate&#13;
7.           These two impact indicators will track changes in the health status of children&#13;
and women, the primary beneficiaries of Component 1. They are considered sensitive to&#13;
project interventions (although also affected by other influences). The data will be made&#13;
available through routine MOH reporting systems as well as special surveys.&#13;
VI, VII. Malaria Prevalence and Case Fatality Rate&#13;
8.           The first is measured by the annual parasite incidence as reported by the&#13;
individual anti-malaria stations of the malaria-affected provinces. This indicator measures the&#13;
risk of malaria infection which shows the progress of malaria prevention activities.&#13;
9.           The second is measured by the deaths due to malaria as a proportion of those&#13;
infected as reported by the whole national health network. This indicator measures the&#13;
effectiveness of case management of malaria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                              Annex 1 1&#13;
VIII, IX. TB Casefinding Rate and Cure Rate&#13;
10.         The first is measured by the proportion of microscopy-confirmed TB infectives&#13;
over the symptomatics examined as reported by the district anti-TB units and confirmed by the&#13;
national or provincial TB coordinators.  This indicator measures the effectiveness of&#13;
diagnosing TB.&#13;
11.         The second is measured by the proportion of those enrolled for treatment&#13;
which have demonstrated negative microscopy findings after completing the course of&#13;
treatment. This would be reported by the districts covered by the TB Control program and&#13;
validated by the provincial or national TB control coordinator. This indicator measures the&#13;
effectiveness of TB treatment.&#13;
X. Proportion of the Population with Access to Adequate Primary Health Services&#13;
12.         "Population with access to adequate primary health services" is defined as&#13;
those people within one hour's normal travel time to a health facility with the capacity for&#13;
providing safe delivery, adequate treatment of malaria and ARI, and dispensing essential drugs&#13;
for free. In the provinces covered by the project, an estimate of the population with such&#13;
access would be made within the first year of project life, and every year thereafter, using&#13;
reported population coverage of the CHCs and DHCs. This indicator measures extent of&#13;
population coverage of this basic service provision.&#13;
XI. Share of Public Spending Allocated to Commune- and District-Level Services&#13;
13.         A table on the sources and uses of Government funds in health will be an&#13;
annual output of one of the sub-components of Component 3. This table will show the&#13;
estimates of funds coming from all parts of Government that are spent for commune- and&#13;
district-level health services. Increasing the share of public funds for this area of health&#13;
provisions indicates greater importance given to financing those services which have the&#13;
greatest likelihood of benefiting the poor. These results will be an important focus of the mid-&#13;
term review.&#13;
XII. Project Disbursement Rate&#13;
14.         Proportion of project funds actually disbursed relative to the scheduled&#13;
disbursement rate. This is an indicator of general efficiency in project implementation.&#13;
XIII. Average Time Deviation of Actual Procurement Actions with Planned Milestones&#13;
15.         Based on the project procurement plan, a critical path for the schedule of&#13;
milestones (e.g., date when technical specifications are submitted to the Bank, date when&#13;
bidding documents are issued, date when bidding is conducted, etc.) which need to be met will&#13;
be established. Actual actions along this plan will be monitored by the NHSP-PMt and the&#13;
average time deviations in weeks (+/-) will measure the efficiency of this specific aspect of&#13;
project implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-                             Annex 11&#13;
XIV. Actions Taken on Key Policy Challenges&#13;
16.         The intended outcome of Component 3 is that the Government would use the&#13;
results of the analytical work undertaken in this component to make progress in addressing&#13;
several major policy challenges facing the sector. Progress in three specific areas would be&#13;
monitored:  (a) completion and approval of a public investment plan, (b) policy statements&#13;
or commitments to project recommendations regarding the pricing of government health&#13;
services; and (c) policy statements or actions concerning project recommendations for&#13;
incentives and regulations needed for more effective private sector provision of health care.&#13;
These topics would be a central focus of the mid-term review. Completion of studies and&#13;
experiments would serve as "markers" of progress but the actual endorsement of the public&#13;
investment plan and the promulgation of specific policies recommended by the project would&#13;
be the ultimate outcome measures of Component 3.&#13;
Organization of Monitoring and Evaluation Activities&#13;
17.         The Health Statistics Unit of the MOH's Department of Planning and Finance&#13;
is responsible for the aggregation and analysis of routine health data from the provinces. It&#13;
would continue to undertake this function and, for the purposes of the project, would provide&#13;
the relevant summary statistics to the NHSP-PMU on a periodic basis. Information on public&#13;
expenditures on health as well as other relevant MOH budgetary information would be&#13;
provided by the Department of Planning and Finance. Similarly, IMPE and the NITRD would&#13;
provide reporting tables on the malaria and TB control program indicators to the PMNU for&#13;
inclusion in annual reports. The PMIU would have responsibility for obtaining data on&#13;
provincial level project management indicators from the provincial PMUs.&#13;
18.         The table below lists the indicators, and gives the proposed timing, formats and&#13;
methods to be used to collect data on these indicators as discussed with MOH. These&#13;
proposals, particularly the formats, will be further detailed and refined as a part of the Project&#13;
Launch Workshop.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
National Health Support Project&#13;
ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS&#13;
1.          The Population and Family Health Project (PFHP) will undertake a number of&#13;
surveys and pilot efforts the results of which will be utilized in the implementation of the NHSP.&#13;
The PFHP will conduct three major surveys (baseline, mid-term review, and final evaluation) for&#13;
the purposes of project evaluation, conduct three major studies that will measure the project&#13;
impact of family planning and family health interventions that cannot be readily measured using a&#13;
population-based survey sample; and conduct special surveys and studies to evaluate the special&#13;
needs, and appropriate strategies for meeting those needs, for the major ethnic minority&#13;
populations.&#13;
Special Surveys and Studies to Address the Population and Family Health Needs of the&#13;
Major Ethnic Minority Populations&#13;
2.          With the exception of the Han, all of the major ethnic groups in Viet Nam are&#13;
known to be demographically disadvantaged relative to the Kinh, with higher rates of both fertility&#13;
and infant mortality. Little information exists, however, to understand the underlying reasons for&#13;
their disadvantage.&#13;
3.          The ten major ethnic minority populations will be over-sampled in the survey&#13;
instruments and special studies mentioned above.  Additional participatory studies, to be&#13;
conducted among each of the ten major ethnic groups, will address their special population and&#13;
family health needs. These assessments will be conducted using focus-group methodology among&#13;
various sub-groups of the ethnic minority populations, including women of reproductive age, men&#13;
of reproductive age, adolescents, grand-mothers, traditional birth attendants or others found to be&#13;
important to decision-making processes in family health.&#13;
4.          Topics to be addressed will include, but are not limited to, the following issues:&#13;
(a) Beneficiary-needs assessments: These special studies will allow members of the&#13;
ethnic minorities to communicate what population and family health needs they have&#13;
that could reasonably be expected to be fulfilled during the project.&#13;
(b) Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of family planning: Contradictory impressions&#13;
exist regarding the acceptability of family planning services in Viet Nam.  The&#13;
Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas (CEMMA) suggests that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99-                               Annex 12&#13;
issue of family planning can be sensitive to certain ethnic groups since they do not&#13;
want to adopt any practice that may jeopardize their cultural identity and preservation&#13;
as a distinct ethnic group. In contrast, preliminary studies suggest that non-use may&#13;
simply reflect lack of accessibility and poor method mix.&#13;
(c) Care during pregnancy and delivery: In order to gain a fuller understanding of&#13;
pregnancy- and delivery-care, special focus groups should be conducted with pregnant&#13;
women, new mothers, traditional birth attendants, and relevant family members.&#13;
Questions should solicit information on the dietary practices of pregnant and&#13;
breastfeeding women, supplementation (if any) with vitamins, work habits, traditional&#13;
practices and beliefs, practices in the event of an obstetric emergency, transportation&#13;
options, etc.&#13;
(d) Family health care: Suggested topics for this component include traditional practices&#13;
for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases (including malaria),&#13;
immunization practices, the use of traditional healers, and the reasons for non-use of&#13;
CHCs.&#13;
Special Strategies for Ethnic Minorities&#13;
5.           Findings of the Baseline Survey Exercise: Most ethnic groups are known from&#13;
census and survey data to be poor, poorly-educated and isolated. It is therefore not surprising that&#13;
their demographic profile is unfavorable. However the proximate determinants of their fertility&#13;
and mortality levels and patterns have been little studied. A first step in the design of any special&#13;
strategy is therefore a set of baseline surveys and participative baseline studies. A model exercise&#13;
of this kind was conducted as part of PFHP project preparation in Dac Lac province&#13;
6.           The major findings of the participative studies conducted in Dac Lac among a&#13;
number of minority groups were as follows:&#13;
(a) family planning, modern contraception and modern health care appear to be very&#13;
acceptable to minority women, couples and communities&#13;
(b) Government and health workers are not always in touch with community attitudes and&#13;
interests in the health and family planning sectors and communications between&#13;
program staff and communities need to be improved&#13;
(c) there is considerable unsatisfied demand for temporary methods of contraception in&#13;
many minority communities, particularly pills and injectables&#13;
(d) health facilities in minority areas were often dilapidated and poorly equipped and&#13;
supplied&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-                               Annex 12&#13;
(e) there is a severe deficiency of good-quality IEC materials and activities in minority&#13;
communes&#13;
(f) there is a large reservoir of interested and motivated minority community members&#13;
who could be tapped for extension, outreach or community-based distribution work&#13;
for family planning and health&#13;
(g) there is a need for refresher training for health and FP staff, particularly for family&#13;
planning, with emphasis on counseling skills and up-to-date knowledge of modern&#13;
contraceptive methods&#13;
(h) there is a need to develop new and specialized approaches to the provision of health&#13;
and family planning services in minority areas, with the emphasis on recruitment and&#13;
specialized training programs for minority community-based workers.&#13;
7.          In line with the above, field observations during project preparation identified the&#13;
following major problems in the delivery of primary health care and family planning in remote&#13;
mountainous areas:&#13;
(a) long travel distances between villages and CHCs, resulting in low utilization of CHCs&#13;
and heavy dependence on DHC mobile teams to provide services&#13;
(b) serious understaffing of CHCs, with many empty facilities used only as premises for&#13;
visiting DHC teams&#13;
(c) serious shortages of minority health workers, due to low educational levels among&#13;
minority groups&#13;
(d) low skill levels among minority health workers, for the same reason&#13;
8.           Outline of a Special Strategy for Health and FP Service Delivery in Remote&#13;
Minority Areas: Based on the above findings, plus available information from other sources, the&#13;
outline of a set of special strategies for delivery of health and family planning services in minority&#13;
areas that are remote and mountainous, and hence isolated and underserved at the present&#13;
moment, has been developed for introduction and testing under the project. Details will be refined&#13;
on the basis of the full findings from the baseline surveys and studies to be conducted as a first&#13;
step, but a preliminary set of possible interventions has been identified. Its principal approach is to&#13;
adapt the standard Viet Nam model of service delivery to the special needs of remote areas and&#13;
minority cultures by upgrading, strengthening and expanding outreach, access and community-&#13;
level or community-based services and promotive activities. Major features are as follows:&#13;
(a) Adaptation of the CHC Model for Remote Mountainous Areas: Since larger in-&#13;
patient CHC facilities which can do deliveries will not be utilized in remote mountainous areas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                             Annex 12&#13;
only small outpatient facilities will be provided in such areas under Component I of the project (as&#13;
well under the NHSP).&#13;
(b) Establishment of Health Posts: A model health post system would be tested in 60&#13;
communes in remote mountainous areas in the 15 PFH project provinces, and expanded under&#13;
Component 1 to all such areas in the 15 project provinces if successful. For a commune to be&#13;
eligible for coverage by the system, it must fulfill the following criteria:&#13;
(i) the CHC must have at least 3 health staff&#13;
(ii) the CHC must be at least 4 hours walking distance from the nearest DHC&#13;
(iii) there must be strong commitment from the Provincial People's Committee&#13;
A health post would be set up in one village in each commune. It would consist of two&#13;
small rooms, one of which would be a consultation room/office and the other a bedroom. Basic&#13;
furniture, medical equipment, a selection of essential drugs, and a bicycle for household visiting&#13;
would be supplied. The health post would be staffed by one of the CHC health workers, on either&#13;
a rotational basis or as a permanent assignment, according to the choice of the workers. The&#13;
health worker in residence would provide basic IEC and services for MCH/FP, including the&#13;
distribution of appropriate contraceptives and some minor curative care. In the separate new&#13;
collaborator system to be also tested (see below) the health post could be staffed by the new&#13;
collaborator.&#13;
(c) Establishment of Family Health Workers: Remote mountainous areas and minority&#13;
areas would participate in the new collaborator model system to be tested under Component 5&#13;
and extended to cover the 15 project provinces if successful under Component 1; out of the total&#13;
45 communes selected for testing, 22 would be in remote mountainous areas and another 5 in&#13;
midland and mountainous areas that are not considered remote. In remote areas, 7 full-time&#13;
collaborators would be recruited per commune (compared to 3 in delta communes and 5 in the&#13;
midland/mountainous areas) and each would be given a bicycle to facilitate household visiting. If&#13;
both the health post and the new collaborator systems are successful, the health posts could be&#13;
staffed by collaborators as an alternative to CHC staff&#13;
(d) Additional Transport for DHC Outreach: Under Component 1, DHCs in remote&#13;
mountainous areas would be provided with extra motorcycles (and in the Mekong Delta, motor&#13;
boats) in order to enhance their outreach capabilities. The vehicles would be used by the DHC&#13;
mobile teams for EPI, FP and control of endemic diseases. The project would also finance&#13;
maintenance and operating costs for the vehicles. The impact of this additional transport would be&#13;
evaluated at the end of the project and continued under regular health/FP budgets if judged&#13;
essential to full functioning of the DHC mobile teams.&#13;
(e) Special Training Strategy for Remote Mountainous Areas: Because of the lack of&#13;
local minority candidates with adequate minimum educational qualifications (completion of high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-                               Annex 12&#13;
school), health staff in these areas are at least 80 percent Kinh. Even so, there is an acute shortage&#13;
of CHC health workers, with more than 50 percent of the approximately 500 communes in the&#13;
remote mountainous areas of the 15 project provinces currently lacking any resident CHC staff&#13;
Such CHCs must be staffed by a seconded DHC worker. Skills of minority health workers, where&#13;
they exist, also often need improvement. Thus special strategies for pre-service and in-service&#13;
training will be implemented in the 15 project provinces in order to both increase minority worker&#13;
numbers and upgrade skills of existing minority staff, as follows:&#13;
(i) Pre-Service Special Training: About 300 minority health workers with below-&#13;
standard educational qualifications would be recruited and trained as "family&#13;
health workers" to serve in CHCs. They would receive a short basic training&#13;
course of about one month, plus two supplementary courses of the same length&#13;
to follow later once the workers were in service. Those who showed promise&#13;
could later take the regular primary midwife pre-service course at the provincial&#13;
secondary medical school and then be upgraded to the level of primary midwife.&#13;
(ii) In-Service Special Training: Frequent refresher training would be provided to&#13;
the approximately 500 minority workers stationed in CHCs in the remote&#13;
mountainous areas, in order to upgrade and maintain their skills. The training&#13;
schedule would comprise four short courses per year of about two days each.&#13;
(iii) Special Training Methodologies: All the in-service and pre-service training&#13;
described above would take place at the DHC in order to facilitate attendance.&#13;
DHCs would be provided with the necessary teaching aids. Training&#13;
methodology and materials would be adapted to lower educational levels&#13;
through: an emphasis on practical skills and demonstration models; heavy use of&#13;
pictorial materials; translation of training materials into local minority&#13;
languages; and special training of DHC trainers in the use of these special&#13;
methodologies and materials.&#13;
A reference manual adapted to this modified training approach will be developed and&#13;
provided to all minority CHC workers (including family planning workers) in remote mountainous&#13;
areas throughout the country, except for the NHSP provinces where it would be provided under&#13;
NHSP financing.&#13;
(f) Special Family Planning Approach for Minority Groups: The project as a whole&#13;
responds to the findings above through support of increased access to and promotion of modern&#13;
temporary methods such as pills and injectables, as well as improved models of IUD. However,&#13;
special approaches will be designed and implemented to adapt family planning services to the&#13;
particular conditions, needs and preferences of minority communities. This will be done after the&#13;
results of the baseline surveys and studies are available for guidance, and will be based on them. It&#13;
is expected that these special approaches will include:&#13;

IDA SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.   IDA Supervision Input. The staff input indicated in the table below is in addition to&#13;
regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions, supervision&#13;
report preparation and correspondence (estimated for this project to require six staff weeks&#13;
per year throughout project implementation).&#13;
2.    Borrower's Contribution to Supervision&#13;
(a) Annual work plans and budgets for the project would be prepared by each central&#13;
MOH department and institute responsible for implementing specific project activities,&#13;
and  each  participating  province.   The plans and  budgets of the central&#13;
departments/institutes would be reviewed by the appropriate technical and financial&#13;
staff of the MOH and the Project Management (PMU). The plans and budgets of the&#13;
provinces would be reviewed by the Project Director and PMU, and would be agreed&#13;
upon between the PMU and the provinces. The PMU would consolidate the plans and&#13;
budgets of the provinces and the departments and institutes into an overall annual&#13;
project plan.&#13;
(b) Semi-annual progress reports would be prepared by the PMU in a format to be agreed&#13;
upon with IDA during the project launch mission. The reports would: (i) include a&#13;
concise, narrative section describing major project achievements and problems&#13;
encountered; and (ii) utilize a simple, tabular account to show details of actual&#13;
accomplishments compared to agreed upon plans. The initial progress report would&#13;
be due on December 31, 1996, with succeeding reports due on June 30 and December&#13;
31 of each year until project completion. The reports would constitute the basis for&#13;
the semi-annual project performance reviews to be conducted by the Government and&#13;
IDA.&#13;
(c) Monitoring and reporting of implementation progress in accordance with the annual&#13;
plans would be the responsibility of the PMU, with inputs from the relevant MOH&#13;
departments/institutes and the provincial PMUs. The PMU would also be responsible&#13;
for organizing annual workshops to review implementation progress with provinces,&#13;
which would be timed to support the annual updating of operational plans and budgets&#13;
(see below).&#13;
(d) The PMU would be responsible for coordinating arrangements for supervision&#13;
missions, and for providing information required by missions. Mission briefings upon&#13;
arrival and wrap-up meetings would be presided over by the Project Director or a&#13;
designated representative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-                             Annex 14&#13;
(e) The PMU would prepare and submit to IDA within six months of the Closing Date a&#13;
final evaluation report on the project and a plan for the future operation of the&#13;
completed project.&#13;

(a) Semi-annual reviews of project performance would be normally be held in March and&#13;
September of each year to assess progress in project implementation.&#13;
(b) A comprehensive mid-term review would be completed on December 31, 1998 to&#13;
determine any need for modification to the design and implementation targets of all&#13;
project components.&#13;
(c) Each IDA supervision mission would: (i) require at least two weeks in the field, (ii)&#13;
the services of specialists in public health and project management/implementation on&#13;
a regular basis; and (iii) review progress of procurement and civil works, financial&#13;
statements and disbursements, Credit covenants, and the implementation of technical&#13;
assistance and training activities. Specialized skill requirements would be added to the&#13;
missions according to needs identified by previous supervision missions and would&#13;
include, among others, the following: malaria and TB control programs, training,&#13;
logistics, health finance, and sample survey methodologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-                             Annex 14&#13;
(d)  At least one of the two semi-annual reviews would be held jointly with the project's&#13;
cofinanciers, who would provide both general supervision and additional specialized&#13;
skills.&#13;
3.    Proposed Specific Supervision Activities By the Borrower&#13;
In light of the MOH' s lack of experience with IDA procedures and the comprehensive&#13;
nature of the project, the following supervision schedule and activities have been discussed&#13;
with the borrower. The details of these arrangements will be finalized during the Launch of&#13;
Project Workshop.&#13;
(a) In January of each project year, the PMU would organize a Procurement Supervision&#13;
mission with participation by representatives from the Medical Equipment and&#13;
Construction Department, Bidding Evaluation Committee, etc. It would visit three&#13;
provinces and would examine:&#13;
* the bidding procedures for civil works,&#13;
* the progress of civil works construction;&#13;
*  the maintenance of completed buildings;&#13;
* the distribution, storage and utilization of essential drugs;&#13;
* the installation, operation and maintenance of equipment;&#13;
The procurement plan for that year would be discussed during the mission.&#13;
(b) In June of each project year, a Financial Supervision mission would be organized by the&#13;
PMU with the participation of representatives from Ministry of Finance, State Bank&#13;
and Auditing Agent, etc. It would visit three provinces and would examine:&#13;
* the Credit disbursement progress;&#13;
* the availability of counterpart funds;&#13;
* book-keeping and accounting procedures;&#13;
Project/program officers from adjacent provinces would be called for a Semi-annual&#13;
Meeting at this occasion to review the implementation progress in the past six months,&#13;
and to prepare the Semi-annual Report.&#13;
(c) A Project Supervision mission would take place each November, which would be&#13;
organized by the PMU with the participation of representatives from MPI, MOF,&#13;
MOH and NCPFP, etc. It would visit three provinces to review the implementation&#13;
progress of each component of the project. The Annual Meeting would be called at&#13;
this occasion, attended by project officers from all 15 provinces and national program&#13;
officers. The Meeting would evaluate the implementation progress during the past 12&#13;
months, then prepare the Action Plan and budget for the next year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-                             Annex 14&#13;
(d) In March and September of each year, IDA would send two supervision teams. These&#13;
missions would visit three provinces each time, thus making it possible for IDA to visit&#13;
all 15 provinces over the life of the project.&#13;
(e). The following table indicates the arrangement of supervision activities in each project&#13;
year. Every project province would be visited at least once a year by the PMU, and&#13;
each field visit would involve site supervision down to the district and commune level.&#13;

            The National Health Support
            Project's overall objective is to improve the health
            status of the rural population of Viet Nam in the poorer
            areas of the country. Specifically, it will aim to: 1)
            provide high quality, reliable primary health care on a
            sustainable basis in fifteen of the poorer provinces; 2)
            reduce nationwide mortality and morbidity due to malaria,
            tuberculosis and acute respiratory infections, as well as
            the adverse socio-economic impacts associated with these
            diseases; and 3) strengthen the capacity of the ministry of
            health (MOH) in policy-formulation, planning and management.
            To achieve these objectives, the project consists of the
            following components: 1) service delivery in the areas of:
            (a) infectious and communicable diseases; (b) maternal and
            child health care; (c) family planning; (d) reproductive
            health services; and (e) other basic health care; 2)
            national program assistance for the Malaria, Tuberculosis
            and Acute Respiratory Infection Programs including provision
            of drugs, insecticides, transport, equipment and technical
            assistance; and 3) strengthening institutional health
            planning and management.
