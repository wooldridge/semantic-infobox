&amp;#12;THE WORLD BANK/IFC ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM&#13;
Memorialist:               Aron Broches&#13;
Date of Interview:         May 23, 1984&#13;
Place of Interview:        Washington, D.C.&#13;
Interviewer:               Robert E. Asher&#13;

&#13;
ASHER:     Today is May 23, 1984.   My name is Robert Asher.   With me here at the&#13;
headquarters of the World Bank is Mr. Aron Broches, whose distinguished career&#13;
with the Bank and elsewhere I summarized on April 18, when we recorded the first&#13;
installment of this interview.      We are here today to continue our conversation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Ronnie, on April 18th we did talk about the policy initiated by George&#13;
Woods of transferring a portion of the surplus of the Bank to IDA, but that's&#13;
about the only mention of either IFC or IDA that we made in that first&#13;
installment.     I should like to begin, therefore, by turning to the creation,&#13;
during the presidency of Eugene Black, of the International Finance Corporation&#13;
and the International Development Association.      The Bank's Articles of Agreement&#13;
were hammered out at the big Bretton Woods of conference, which you attended,&#13;
and most of the other post-World War II international agencies were also created&#13;
at big conferences.     The IFC and IDA Articles, however, were written by a&#13;
handful of people, the Executive Directors of the World Bank.      Whose idea was&#13;
that, and how noteworthy is that departure from previous practice?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    The first question I honestly can't answer.    I don't remember whose&#13;
idea it was.     I think it was a good idea.   It was a very noteworthy departure&#13;
from existing practice.     I wrote about it at some modest length in the course of&#13;
lectures which I gave in 1959 at the Academy of International Law in the Hague,&#13;
a course of lectures called "The International Legal Aspects of the Operations&#13;
of the World Bank," and I mentioned the connection with the purpose of the Bank&#13;
and its Articles of Agreement.      This activity was one of negotiating, of&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
formulating new international agreements, charters of new international&#13;
institutions.     I guess at the time I gave those lectures I could only have&#13;
talked about the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     I heard you in 1965, I think, at the American Society of International&#13;
Law â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Correct â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ and they were both in business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     At that time there were three.      At that time I talked about the two&#13;
that were already in business, that is, the IFC and the IDA, and I talked about&#13;
ICSID, which had already been negotiated, but had not yet entered into&#13;
operation.     Now, ICSID is significant, because a treaty governing its activity&#13;
is one that one normally wouldn't have thought would be proper for formulation&#13;
by an international institution, but without good reason.         I mean, it's just&#13;
that people thought that it wasn't be done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I remember a conversation at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#13;
in connection with the negotiation of ICSID, but the same thing could have&#13;
happened with IFC or IDA.     They said, "But don't you need a diplomatic&#13;
conference?"     and I said, "No, why?   You need a meeting of the minds.     But how&#13;
that meeting of the minds is arrived at is something to be decided by those who&#13;
are setting about creating a new institution."         Well, this didn't fit the&#13;
traditional way of thinking of the Japanese Foreign Office establishment, and&#13;
particularly not their Treaty Division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            It might have been something else if the Executive Directors of the&#13;
Bank had started drafting a charter for an agricultural export corporation.            But&#13;
here, what the Directors were doing was to add something to the existing&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                       -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
instruments for promoting economic development.      In the case of IFC, it was to&#13;
give emphasis to the private sector.      In the case of IDA it was to give emphasis&#13;
to those countries whose absorptive capacity was greater than their credit-&#13;
worthiness.     In the case of ICSID, to get slightly ahead of the story, it was to&#13;
create a set of instruments which might help attract foreign investment to&#13;
countries that needed it, thereby once again assisting the task of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Now, the successive legal advisors of the Bank have always taken the&#13;
position that the Bank can engage in other activities apart from those which are&#13;
expressly mentioned in the Articles.     Let me say that, strangely enough, if you&#13;
look at the Articles, you won't find an explicit statement saying that the Bank&#13;
is allowed to borrow.     You derive it from a provision about loans. The Bank may&#13;
make loans out of its capital, it may make loans out of borrowed funds, very&#13;
interesting....      Then later you get the statement, that the Bank may only&#13;
borrow with the consent of the country whose currency is involved, etcetera.         In&#13;
other words, the power to borrow is there, but it is expressed only indirectly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     That's in part because originally at Bretton Woods they were thinking of&#13;
a guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, the Articles state that the Bank may lend, or guarantee, but no, I&#13;
think it's more that the Articles weren't very artistically drawn, even though&#13;
there were a number of lawyers around.     It would have been handled quite&#13;
differently if there had been more time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            And there's another thing.   There are two ways of drafting a charter:&#13;
you can have what I will call the American style--which may also be the UK&#13;
style, but I can't say for sure--or you can have the Continental style.       Now, in&#13;
the American style, you enumerate powers in great detail.      Then, you may still&#13;
have a residual power provision.     In the Continental style, you say the purpose&#13;
of the corporation or institution is to do such-and-such, and it may engage in&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                       -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
any activities that are necessary or useful for that purpose, save fro some&#13;
stipulated exceptions, for instance conducting an insurance business or engaging&#13;
in some other regulated industry.     The Bank's.Articles were somewhat in between.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I deviated somewhat, but what I come back to is that it's been the view&#13;
of successive General Counsel, including myself--I can't say what happened after&#13;
my retirement--that, to put it in extreme terms, everything that's not&#13;
prohibited is permitted, as long as it serves the purposes of the institution,&#13;
and as long as it is not inconsistent with anything else in the Articles that&#13;
might not explicitly prohibit it, but might be inconsistent with the actions&#13;
proposed.     In the case of these three institutions, we didn't see any reason why&#13;
the in-house procedures couldn't be followed.       Members might have objected, and&#13;
I'll tell you why, and why it is noteworthy.        The negotiatons took place in the&#13;
Board.    Now, whether there were eighteen, or twenty, or twenty-two Directors&#13;
doesn't matter.     There weren't as many Directors as there were members, so not&#13;
every member had an occasion to participate in the preparatory work, which is&#13;
typical ,,,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:    That is, participate directly â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES: Directly, yes.    They had to do it through their Directors.      Now, that&#13;
was no problem for those five countries that appointed Directors, it was just a&#13;
question of instructing them what to say.     It became much more complicated in&#13;
the case of Directors who represented more than one country, and there have been&#13;
some extreme cases of fifteen or sixteen countries represented by one Director.&#13;
For him it's much more difficult.     In the case of ICSID, we found that direct&#13;
participation was so important that we established another mechanism, about&#13;
which I will not speak now.     In the case of IFC and IDA, the Directors&#13;
themselves were experts,    In the case of ICSID, which is a legal institution&#13;
although with heavy policy content, the Directors might or might not be experts&#13;
depending on their past life.    In the other, they were deemed to be experts, but&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                       -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
it remained for them to decide which side they would choose if their&#13;
constituents weren't of the same view.     Now, do you want to know the reasons for&#13;
those two institutions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER: .Well, I asked the question in part because, while it seems to be an&#13;
excellent example, it certainly hasn't been followed by other organizations,&#13;
some of which might. conceivably have found a better way than the mass meetings&#13;
--diplomatic conferences--which they used to establish new machinery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     I have a comment on that, with respect to IDA.     It doesn't hold for&#13;
IFC--well, possibly even for IFC.     The activities that IFC was to undertake--and&#13;
I don't need to talk about them now--could have been undertaken within the&#13;
framework of the Bank, if we had amended the Articles.        There were two reasons&#13;
why we didn't.     The first is the fear that if you open the very attractive can&#13;
labeled "Articles of Agreement of the World Bank", it may turn out to be a can&#13;
of worms, or worms will get in once you start talking about amendments.        The day&#13;
that happens, it may be regarded as an open season for all sorts of ideas by&#13;
members.     That's one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The other is--and I think it was somewhat exaggerated because, after&#13;
all, we did amend the Articles to permit the Bank to lend to IFC in the 1960s--a&#13;
public relations or political one, and one on which I was always on the negative&#13;
side, and the losing side, and maybe rightly so; that is, in order to impress&#13;
the world with the importance of the act, you have to set up a new institution.&#13;
This was true for IFC, although I don't think it was much debated.        It was just&#13;
assumed that there would be a new institution.      It was very true of IDA.    In the&#13;
case of IDA, many of us felt that it was a waste of effort to go through the&#13;
whole exercise of creating a new international institution.       IDA could be set up&#13;
as a trust fund.     No amendment of the Articles was needed; we would just set up&#13;
a trust.    One of the things the legal advisors of the Bank and the management&#13;
and Directors also did was set up all sorts of trust funds: we had a trust&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                         -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
fund for riverblindness, for the Indus, for the Nam Ngum project in Laos in&#13;
which we didn't even have money of our own. There were all sorts of things that&#13;
we thought we could do, because they served our purpose, and there was no reason&#13;
why they shouldn't be done, as they weren't inconsistent with anything else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I thought that in the case of IDA we could have just set up a trust&#13;
fund the way the UNDP was set up within the United Nations.         But the U.S. in&#13;
particular--and, as I recall, heavily supported by the UK--felt that in order to&#13;
make it a success, it had to be very visible.         It had to be a separate&#13;
institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Well, a separate institution raises another question.      In the case of&#13;
the IFC, the Bank staff, including its Legal Department, does not serve the IFC;&#13;
it's separate machinery.        In the case of the IDA, the staff is integrated;&#13;
there's no distinction.     How did that difference come about, and do you consider&#13;
it fortunate, unfortunate, or not very important?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Well, let me start with IDA.     Since the only intended difference&#13;
between the Bank and IDA was the financial terms on which money would be lent,&#13;
there was no reason whatsoever to have different people dealing with essentially&#13;
the same problem.      Now this view, as I recall, was not challenged when we set up&#13;
IDA.     I think it was challenged by Klackenberg, who was then the equivalent of&#13;
Director of Foreign Aid in Sweden, who felt that IDA should have a separate&#13;
staff.     There may even be something in the Pearson Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     There is.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     They recommend it.&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                        -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     But that was â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     The influence came from Sweden.   I've never understood it.     I had a&#13;
long conversation with Klackenberg, during a very long lunch in Stockholm when I&#13;
met him, and after he explained it to me three times, I still couldn't&#13;
understand it.      He felt that one should approach IDA in a different frame of&#13;
mind, and that the same person couldn't deal with two such different clients.&#13;
The fact that it was the same client, one day it was IDA and the other the Bank,&#13;
didn't impress him.      The fact that there was joint financing, in the sense of&#13;
one project being financed in part with Bank funds and in part with IDA funds,&#13;
didn't impress him either.      He felt that the two should be separate, and should&#13;
be driven by different motivations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But IFC â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     This was something that came up later.   I don't recall that it was&#13;
ever an issue when we drafted the IFC Articles of Agreement.      IFC is a good&#13;
demonstration of a mixture of policy and personalities, because when IFC was&#13;
created, it was clear that the head of it would be [Robert L.] Garner, and&#13;
Garner was then the Vice President and really, you might say, General Manager&#13;
--although that title didn't exist--of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Garner, in the first place, was a very strong, passionate promoter of&#13;
the private sector, and thought that it was the only valid method of promoting&#13;
economic development.      He always felt slightly embarrassed to be in an&#13;
institution that was governmental, and dealt with governments, and so he was&#13;
very happy that such a institution was being created to assist the private&#13;
sector,     He was then in his early sixties, and it was clear, I think, that he&#13;
wanted to be number one in an institution.      And Black, who is a person who is&#13;
very loyal to his staff, particularly to staff who have been loyal to him, felt&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                      -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
that Garner had been a great support to him, and had done the routine work of&#13;
managing the institution while he traveled, and so forth. Black felt that he&#13;
owed Garner something within the bounds of reason during his last few years in&#13;
active life in the World Bank environment.     So, Garner was going to be head of&#13;
IFC.   That was great, except that the Executive Directors didn't like Garner one&#13;
little bit, and that accounts for the strange structure of the Articles of IFC.&#13;
If I mention it here, it is because I found out that various IFC legal and other&#13;
staff had never realized why the Articles got drafted in such a funny way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            In the Bank, you know, there are three tiers: Governors, Directors, and&#13;
the President, who is selected by the Directors.     And the President is Chairman&#13;
of the Board of Executive Directors.     In IFC, you have the Governors, the&#13;
Executive Directors, who are called Board of Directors, because it sounds more&#13;
businesslike, and the Chairman of the Board on whose recommendation the&#13;
President of IFC is selected by the Board.     So, there's no necessary identity&#13;
between the Chairman of the Board and the President.     One can fairly say it was&#13;
not expected that the Chairman of the Board and the President would be one and&#13;
the same person.     Black as Chairman, would recommend Garner, and then on this&#13;
nomination the Board would select Garner as President of IFC.    Also, the&#13;
Articles of Agreement were drafted in such a way that Garner couldn't be fired&#13;
without the consent of Black.     You see, this strange structure was devised&#13;
strictly to take care of particular personal relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            When Garner left the reason for this structure disappeared, and Black&#13;
asked my advice.     He asked if he could become President of IFC, and I said, "If&#13;
you have a high opinion of yourself, I see no reason why you shouldn't recommend&#13;
yourself for the job.     The Executive Directors undoubtedly will be happy to&#13;
accept you, and if you think that you are doing badly, you can recommend that&#13;
you be fired, and that would be done, too."&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                         -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     The staff of IFC continued, even after the â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Well, you see, it did and it didn't.       There were some differences.       I&#13;
gave you this story in the first place.       I think that somewhere, this weird&#13;
drafting of the Articles and the reasons for it should be recorded.          Secondly,&#13;
there was evidence of a strong separatist sentiment, certainly on the part of&#13;
IFC's management.      Black would just as lief have had the two institutions&#13;
together.     In the beginning, the operational staff of IFC was separate.         The&#13;
legal staff was not.      I was General Counsel of IFC.     When Garner wanted special&#13;
service, or rather identifiable service, we allocated some legal resources to&#13;
IFC, and the late [R.B.J.] Dick Richards, who later became General Counsel of&#13;
IFC, was head of that element.       Garner felt that that wasn't enough, and that he&#13;
didn't get the service or the priority he wanted.          I know that he felt that&#13;
private clients ought to get service before governments.         Also, the Legal&#13;
Department had some comments on some of their clients, which he didn't&#13;
particularly like.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            So, at a given moment, he decided that he wanted to have his own&#13;
General Counsel.      I pleaded with Black not to go along with that, because Garner&#13;
was going to leave in a year, if not sooner.          I said that once a separate legal&#13;
department had been created it would be almost impossible to reverse the&#13;
decision.     And to do something which is irreversible, for somebody who's about&#13;
to leave, I thought was wrong.       Black said he just couldn't do that to Garner.&#13;
He could do it to me, even though he agreed that it was wrong to have two&#13;
General Counsel, but he couldn't do it to Garner.         Garner was his support, and&#13;
his friend, and he was going to leave.       So this was quite â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Was he mildly relieved not to have Garner in the Bank itself, because&#13;
Garner by that time had a lot of enemies?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes.   This was 1956.   He had a lot of enemies.    Certainly Garner's&#13;
going to IFC made it possible for Black to widen the management structure.               Then&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                           -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
there was William Iliff, Davidson Sommers and Burke Knapp, who became the three&#13;
Vice Presidents.     And he still stayed close to Garner.       He may have felt that&#13;
this was good all around, because it certainly made Garner happy.          It was the&#13;
one thing he wanted most, and as I said, it gave the Bank some breathing space&#13;
in more than one way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            But, on the legal side, certainly the Bank lawyers, and maybe the IFC&#13;
lawyers, liked the variety of looking one way at one project and another way at&#13;
another project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     And that was denied them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     And that was denied them.     On   the other hand, there were problems&#13;
common to the two institutions.        And I must say that in fact, the top&#13;
managements, that is the President of both the Bank and IFC--because since the&#13;
departure of Garner they've been both Chairman of the Board and President--would&#13;
consult with the Bank's General Counsel as the senior legal advisor, officially&#13;
or unofficially, and IFC General Counsel Richards would say, "I've discussed&#13;
this with my colleague of the World Bank and he agrees," things of that type.&#13;
After an initial rough period there was a peaceful coexistence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Let's now turn for a moment to IDA.      Was IDA's unwillingness to accept&#13;
tied contributions from Part I governments an issue in which you became&#13;
involved?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes.&#13;

&#13;
ASHER:     Well, I think it first came up at the very beginning, because there was&#13;
some hope that it would become a â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BORCHES:     Oh, you mean the Monroney funds?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Yes, but later, too.   I'm more interested in the latter part of â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, no, the Monroney proposal was very quickly accepted.     Reluctantly,&#13;
but as a pure public relations element.      It was not considered seriously at all.&#13;
If you read through the minutes of      those early meetings of the Directors, you&#13;
can see all the jokes that were being made.        It's what the U.S. wanted, and it&#13;
is in the Articles that those who contribute, quote, "Monroney funds" would get&#13;
a special development certificate.      One of the Dircetors asked if that was the&#13;
same as trading stamps.     The meetings were at times uproariously funny.     So that&#13;
was the early tied contributions.      Later, yes, it did come back, and it stayed&#13;
with us.     I was among those who were opposed to it.     I'm not sure that this&#13;
really reduced funds that were available.       I'm not sure at all.   And I think&#13;
there would have been considerable danger in becoming a channel for various â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     You can argue that it's increased them because they might have given you&#13;
soft money or something for what they later were willing to do in hard money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Well, yes, that's right, but it wasn't a great issue.     It came up&#13;
again as a specific issue with the Special Action Fund of the European&#13;
Community.     There was a billion or a billion-and-a-half, which the EEC made&#13;
available to the Bank, subject to some restrictions which were finally&#13;
accepted.But it avoided the real dangers of either commercial considerations or&#13;
political considerations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Were you involved in the negotiation of IDA replenishments, and in any&#13;
event, would you care to comment on how they were conducted?&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                      -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Yes, I was.   This became a specialty of my deputy, Lester Nurick.       He&#13;
handled the legal part, and I think more than the legal part, with great skill.&#13;
With one or two exceptions, I was not present during the negotiations; at the&#13;
pre-negotiating stage, yes, but I didn't go to these negotiating sessions.         They&#13;
were extremely difficult.     When we drafted the Articles, we picked an amount out&#13;
of the air which seemed not to be too frightening: a billion dollars, of which&#13;
seven hundred fifty million was to be real money, with a five-year expected&#13;
replenishment period.     Well, this didn't work at all.    That would have been one&#13;
hundred fifty million dollars a year.     The first replenishment was done after&#13;
three years, and after that there were generally three-year periods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           In the beginning, it was not too difficult.     The first replenishment&#13;
was difficult because George Woods had started from an unrealistically high&#13;
amount, but that was cut down.     But after that, various tensions developed.       The&#13;
United States wanted its share to be progressively reduced, which, in part at&#13;
least, was perfectly reasonable.     I suppose nobody liked to see it, but it was a&#13;
reasonble demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Then, there were a number of technical problems that took enormous&#13;
amounts of time.    What did one do about the Part II countries?    They couldn't&#13;
put up any real money, and yet one didn't want their voting power to be eroded.&#13;
Much time was spent on devising formulae, and the main device that was used to&#13;
safeguard the position of the developing countries was to make a distinction&#13;
between subscriptions and contributions.     The subscriptions carried voting&#13;
rights, and contributions didn't.     So, I would say to you, "I expect from you a&#13;
hundred dollars, of which two dollars will be a subscription," and I know that&#13;
98 is contributions so you get two votes, which enabled me to say to somebody&#13;
else, who only had two dollars, "You may use all of that as a subscription."&#13;
So, his voting rights would be preserved, and wouldn't be diluted, as a result&#13;
of much larger amounts coming in.     This was really an extremely time-consuming&#13;
effort, and I was very grateful to my deputy, Lester Nurick, who discussed&#13;
strategy with me and then went to do battle at endless sessions.      It was not&#13;
even particularly controversial, but it was damned difficult.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
            Another difficulty was that there are certain pre-emptive rights&#13;
provisions in the Articles of Agreement of IDA entitling a country to maintain&#13;
its voting rights, which can only be deviated from with a waiver by everyone.&#13;
All these things can either cause delays for purely administrative reasons, or&#13;
they may be used to get something else,       So the negotiations were always&#13;
difficult, either for technical reasons, or for more substantive reasons, and&#13;
the substantive problem was always burden-sharing, on which there's been&#13;
disagreement from the start.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            There were the easy "touches": the Scandinavians, the Dutch, the&#13;
Canadians.     The British were fairly easy, and those who didn't like the British&#13;
to get recognition for being easy and cooperative said that most of the money&#13;
was going to India and Pakistan.     They felt that much of the lending to these&#13;
countries was for general import loans, or industrial project loans which&#13;
involve a lot of spare parts, and so forth, and since those countries have their&#13;
traditional links with suppliers in the U.K., a lot of the money would flow back&#13;
to the U.K., much more than the U.K. put in.       The back flow in this case is more&#13;
easily demonstrable than, for instance, in the case of the U.S., where the&#13;
direct back flow was relatively small.       Now, I must add that I don't think the&#13;
British Parliament does the accounting of how much they get back.          Certainly the&#13;
Treasury does, and so they could just find it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The U.S. was always difficult.    The French were difficult.     Japan was&#13;
being pressured to increase its share, which it did, under loud protestations.&#13;
It expected, if it increased its share in IDA, to be permitted to subscribe to&#13;
more shares in the Bank, so that their voting rights in the parent institution&#13;
--not technically parent, but felt to be--would be greater.       And as you know, at&#13;
this.very moment--! don't know the details of this matter of great travail and&#13;
very great bitterness--apparently the U.S., which at first agreed to the&#13;
Japanese demand, now expects something in a totally unrelated field from the&#13;
Japanese, before they will permit them to subscribe to more shares in the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
Well, if the Japanese don't subscribe to more shares in the Bank, they probably&#13;
have an excellent case for walking away from their commitment to put more into&#13;
IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             So, it's this kind of thing, sometimes involving large sums, sometimes&#13;
involving small amounts.      But each negotiaton has been extremely painful:&#13;
should the value of the funds of the replenishment be maintained, and what&#13;
currency should the commitments be expressed in?      There were differences of&#13;
opinion on these points.      I'm not sure that the ones who won their point also in&#13;
fact profited, because exchange rates didn't change in the same way convential&#13;
wisdon expected them to.      So, I'll say at once: it's never a happy situation.&#13;
In the days when we did finish with the intended result, it was a last minute&#13;
affair, and as you know, for the past few years the target just hasn't been met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     I had the feeling, from my recollection, that the U.S. has been a bigger&#13;
problem than anybody else in the negotiation of replenishments.      This raises a&#13;
more general question of the Bank's relations with its host and largest&#13;
stockholder.     Did the U.S. from time to time get, quote "special treatment"&#13;
unquote, from Bank presidents and/or Bank officers?      I put the thing in&#13;
quotes â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Oh, yes.   Well, let me take the special treatment literally and&#13;
without any value judgement attached to it.      It did, right from the beginning.&#13;
Loan proposals, or the documents before they went to the Board, were shown to&#13;
the U.S., and the special treatment was said to be necessary so that the&#13;
National Advisory Council, which then looked at every loan proposal--maybe they&#13;
still do--and then instructed the Executive Director, would have time to look at&#13;
it.    Obviously, they might also then make some warning noises, or some negative&#13;
noises, which I just don't remember.      I do know that some of us thought that it&#13;
was not exactly even-handed to give the U.S. advance information on these loans.&#13;
That I distinctly remember.&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                       -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     You felt this both in your capacity as a legal advisor and as a national&#13;
of a country other than the     u.s.?&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes.   Well, you can't say that there was a very strict law on this&#13;
point, although I'm not so sure that an institution, in supplying information to&#13;
members, shouldn't observe equality of treatment as a broad legal principle.&#13;
But I felt that even as a matter of policy it was a bad thing.      There were some&#13;
practical reasons, but then you could have compensated for those in another way.&#13;
But this was regarded as quite normal.      The U.S. was the largest shareholder, it&#13;
wanted something, and it got it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I also remember--by that time I was getting a little bored with the&#13;
recurrent claims for, quote, "special treatment"--when we negotiated IDA, I had&#13;
a big fight with the U.S. legal advisor, who insisted that proposals that the&#13;
staff was working out be shown to him before they were shown to other members of&#13;
the Bank.     I told him that we wouldn't do it, and he was very unhappy.   He said,&#13;
"We're the largest shareholder, and we have all this Monroney money."       I said,&#13;
"Don't talk about the Monroney money."      So from time to time one resisted&#13;
successfully, and Sommers--he was just at the point of leaving--agreed with my&#13;
opposition to clearing drafts, or even showing them, to one member before you&#13;
put them out as just a suggestion.      So there has been that kind of problem.&#13;
Now, for the rest, undoubtedly, the U.S.--but not only the U.S.--if it felt&#13;
strongly about something, would talk directly to the President.&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
There is no doubt that in the first years the proportion of U.S. personnel was&#13;
very high, in part because there weren't any others around, but also in part&#13;
because the Americans felt more comfortable with each other and, if they had to&#13;
deal with foreigners--! once said this at a so-called lost week-end of the&#13;
senior staff--preferred the British, although there are many things, such as&#13;
language, that divide the two.     Now when you come to the Europeans' defense,&#13;
there's the question of how good their English is, and of course the French are&#13;
very difficult.     I said these things at that meeting--Black was still the&#13;
President.     I said that these feelings had led to an under-representation of&#13;
these countries in the staff, and as we walked away after the meeting, Black&#13;
said, "Well, Ronnie, of course you were right, but, God, these people can be&#13;
difficult!"     That's where that subject was left.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            "Europe and the Bank" was one of the subjects on the agenda.   The&#13;
relationship was not a happy one.     I said that the Bank was not run to serve&#13;
American interests; that was not the point.     In fact, I knew of instances where&#13;
the management had refused to accept U.S. suggestions or requests.      However, if&#13;
one thinks along American lines--that is, if mostly Americans are running the&#13;
Bank--the style and approach of the institution will clearly be marked thereby.&#13;
Therefore, in Europe--that was the issue at the time--the Bank was regarded as&#13;
an American institution, which was very enlightened and â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Would you say is regarded, or was regarded?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES;     Well, it was then, in the late 1950s, early 1960s.   It was then&#13;
regarded as basically an American institution, but one that was working for the&#13;
general benefit.     The Europeans didn't feel that it was their institution.     I&#13;
recall that this whole discussion was related to the capital increase in&#13;
connection with the opening of markets.     The Europeans tended to talk about&#13;
"they" instead of "we". This has changed.&#13;

ASHER:     Relations between the Bank and the Fund were not very close during the&#13;
early years, but are much better today than they were.        Can you comment on those&#13;
ups and downs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     I have no very significant comments to offer.     Of course, there have&#13;
always been personality problems.     The President of the Bank and the Managing&#13;
Director of the Fund each considers himself, with some reason, as the most&#13;
important person in his field. Cooperation between the two, quote, "most&#13;
important people" is not easy.     The fact that the President was always an&#13;
American and the Managing Director a European--successively Belgian, Swedish&#13;
twice, French, Dutch, and again French--the different management styles and the&#13;
differences in management-Board relations also militated against true intimacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Well, the chief executives have to get along at the Bank-Fund meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes, and there, surprisingly, there are no major clashes, although I&#13;
remember a number of clashes on minor issues between the secretariats.        As you&#13;
know, the leading role rotates annually.     One year the meeting is a Fund-Bank&#13;
meeting and the next year a Bank-Fund meeting.        In earlier years, there were&#13;
problems about the use of Fund staff on missions.        For example, the World Bank&#13;
sent out the so-called Economic Survey Missions.        I was the head of one to&#13;
Nigeria, and we wanted for the monetary field staff from the Fund.        This had to&#13;
be approved by the Fund's Executive Directors.        There was some question of how&#13;
independent they could be, whether they were under the directon of the mission&#13;
leader, or of the Fund.     There was a different style in the Fund from the Bank,&#13;
which, I think, inhibited close cooperation.        From Legal's side, there were only&#13;
relatively few questions on which common action was necessary or desirable, and&#13;
although approaches differed there, too, we worked them out.        There were some&#13;
Annual Meeting issues, China in particular.     From my side of the house the&#13;
relations were about neutral.     It was strange, of course, that we didn't have&#13;
closer relations.     There was no enmity either.     It was sort of like twins who&#13;
didn't suit each other very well.&#13;

ASHER:     Does it make real sense to you to have membership in the Fund a pre-&#13;
requisite for membership in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Oh, I think probably it does,   It was a given, and the justification&#13;
was that only those who were prepared to work for orderly exchange arrangements&#13;
should be eligible to borrow long-term money.        That, briefly, was the original&#13;
idea, and I think that the current serious tensions between the Bank and Fund&#13;
about their respective roles--a development that largely post-dates my&#13;
retirement--would be further exacerbated if the link didn't exist.       To go back&#13;
to the earlier years, one country--now let me see, I think it was Australia&#13;
--postponed its membership in the Bank because it was not certain about what it&#13;
wanted to do in the Fund.     I guess Switzerland would have become a member of the&#13;
Bank if that link hadn't existed.     Not in order to borrow, but to find a proper&#13;
way to contribute funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     And Switzerland would be reluctant to make available all the information&#13;
the Fund wants?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     I don't think that that was a problem.    The way they told me--and the&#13;
"they" in this case were Governors of the Swiss National Bank the Directors-&#13;
General of the Treasury--it was their fear that the scarce currency provision of&#13;
the Fund's Articles--which I think has never been invoked--might be invoked.&#13;
Switzerland was admittedly rich, but as a small country, it was afraid of the&#13;
consequences of Fund action that would affect the Swiss franc, and the situation&#13;
hasn't changed basically. There is always talk of joining the Fund and Bank, but&#13;
no action.     Of course, Switzerland is cooperating with the Fund through the GAB&#13;
[General Agreement to Borrow] and with the Bank Group by making long-term&#13;
interest-free loans to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But today, if Argentina or Brazil objected strenuously to a&#13;
stabilization program proposed by the Fund, and they said thank you, goodbye,&#13;
they would automatically have to cease being members of the Bank too, wouldn't&#13;
they?&#13;

Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Well,     on the Bank side the Secretary was mostly involved.       The Fund&#13;
was always the first one to consider applications, and the negotiation of quota&#13;
was entirely a Fund matter in which not only the staff but a committee of&#13;
Executive Directors were heavily involved.          In the beginning, the Bank&#13;
subscription was calculated by a simple mechanical formula.          There were some&#13;
legal problems for the admission of--that's a long time ago--Germany and Italy&#13;
and especially Austria:          a question of whether they were states, and to what&#13;
extent they could assume international obligatio, considering the various&#13;
post-war instruments that governed.them.         So we had that set of problems with&#13;
the former European enemies of the Atlantic alliance.         With Japan, there was no&#13;
problem,     Of course, China was a perennial problem, but,,,&#13;

BROCHES:     Right, it was a problem of which government represented China.      China&#13;
was a member, that was clear, and the issue of recognizing the Government of the&#13;
People's Republic as the representative of China was raised for the first time&#13;
in 1950, at the Paris Annual Meeting.      It has come back regularly, and was&#13;
finally resolved three years ago, long after the UN had taken action.&#13;

specialists, yes, but, in the broader perspective, I would say no.       Well,&#13;
there's one--I should make one exception--and that is the question of&#13;
jurisdiction over the Bank, an issue considered in connection with the Bank's&#13;

&#13;
BROCHES:     Not particularly, even though I thought I was technically right.         As&#13;
you say, the UN General Assembly repeatedly asked the Bank and the Fund to cease&#13;
assistance to Portugal and South Africa, and these resolutions were sent to the&#13;
institutions.         The Fund never even answered.   We always said that we'd sent it&#13;
to our Directors, and that they would send the papers to the Governors.          This&#13;
went on for some years, until there was a particularly urgent request to stop&#13;
lending.     It came at the worst moment for the Bank, because the Bank had decided&#13;
that South Africa, political considerations apart, should be phased out.          South&#13;
Africa manufactured the raw material that enabled it to dispense with World Bank&#13;
assistance, but â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes, in order to make for somewhat of a transition, George Woods had&#13;
said to the South Africans that he'd make them one more loan, sort of a farewell&#13;
loan, but only on condition that they would go to the market, and borrow there:&#13;
Germany, the United States, it didn't matter where.          It was a graduation, if you&#13;
will, except that this was a country that was politically very visible, and&#13;
disliked by very many other countries.         Apart from that, you could compare it&#13;
with what's going on now with graduation.         And so they were told, first, that&#13;
there would be only one more loan, and secondly, that they had to raise an&#13;
equivalent amount in the market.         That was South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Portugal was told that its economy was stagnant because they were&#13;
salting away foreign exchange for the future colonial war.         Agriculture ought to&#13;
be revamped, the Bank had made reports, but the Government was not serious about&#13;
it and the Bank would not lend to Portugal until it changed its economic policy.&#13;
Now what happened within months after those General Assembly resolutions was&#13;
that South Africa went to the market and borrowed money, and Portugal changed&#13;
its economic policy.        The question was then whether the Bank should honor its&#13;
commitments to the two countries,         It was decided that we should honor them.&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
            Then the UN, of course, was unhappy.      It was the Russians who made&#13;
particularly nasty remarks, which was easy for them, not being members of the&#13;
Bank.     They said that the Bank was showing the greatest contempt for the UN.&#13;
Its representatives didn't even come to meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            George Woods then had a bright idea.      He   was going to show that the&#13;
Bank had no contempt for the UN.       He would fight them to his last General&#13;
Counsel â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ !    He informed the Secretariat that I would appear.      I did, with a&#13;
prepared statement.       I then noticed something very strange.    You talk of&#13;
American, or French or Dutch positions, and there is no such thing.          There are&#13;
the Dutch who know about the Bank, then the Dutch who know about the UN,&#13;
etcetera.       The only ones who speak with one voice may be the British.     In other&#13;
countries there were different ministries and less coordination, some UN&#13;
delegates of countries that were voting in the Bank in favor of loans for&#13;
Portugal and South Africa, when I saw them at the UN, they said "What's this all&#13;
about?     I hope you'll defend us."    I said, "Defend you?     Defend the institution&#13;
without saying that these are the countries which want us to make these loans?"&#13;
They had no brief They just stayed away, or sent junior people who were totally&#13;
uninformed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            When I arrived at the UN, the Trusteeship Council had just finished&#13;
hearing witnesses who were testifying about maltreatment, I think, in Angola.&#13;
And the witnesses had sat below the table of the President, facing the delegates&#13;
because, it was explained to me, then the delegates could see you and know&#13;
whether you were honest or not.      A UN Secretariat officer told me with some&#13;
trepidation that it had been suggested that I speak from the same place, rather&#13;
than from the IBRD observer's seat, which is in the back of the hall where&#13;
nobody can see you.       I could have objected as a formal matter, but I decided not&#13;
to, since I much preferred to address faces rather than backs.         Well, I read&#13;
that prepared piece, noting, among other things, that General Assembly&#13;
resolutions were not binding on the Bank, and of course the Russians again made&#13;
various critical remarks, cost free, and asked whether, since I was such a good&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
lawyer, I could give them some legal advice: how could the UN phrase its&#13;
resolutions so that they would be binding on the Bank?        I declined the honor and&#13;
I said that I wouldn't compete with their own legal counsel.        I would&#13;
nevertheless mention one method which must be very well known to them; it was&#13;
the Uniting for Peace Resolution of the General Assembly, which was adopted by&#13;
the General Assembly to overcome their veto on the Korea issue in 1950.        That&#13;
remark was very distateful to them.      But there were several rather passionate&#13;
remarks by countries, including Tanzania and Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            This confrontation was followed by an exchange of memoranda between the&#13;
Bank and the UN Secretariat.     Well, basically, the unassailable position of the&#13;
Bank was that the UN had in fact not ordered the Bank to do anything, couldn't&#13;
have done so, and the Bank wasn't bound, and its Articles forbade it to act&#13;
based on political motives.     What we maintained--which was not unassailable, but&#13;
I think was right--was that we weren't even permitted to do it.        So one aspect&#13;
was that the UN couldn't force us, the other was that we couldn't respond to â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     It sounds much more debatable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     It is somewhat debatable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Because you did respond, really, didn't you?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Well, after we'd said that we couldn't respond, we did in fact&#13;
respond.    We did made no more loans.      We did not make loans to Portugal because,&#13;
once again, they were in an economic mess, and of course South Africa had agreed&#13;
in advance that it wouldn't receive any further loans.        Moreover, in the case of&#13;
South Africa, I suppose we wouldn't have made a loan anyway, even if they had&#13;
abolished apartheid, because they didn't need the money.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
            In the case of Portugal, the UN issue was never discussed.     No&#13;
Executive Director, no Portuguese_representative, no staff member, no President&#13;
raised the question of further loans to Portugal.      It was just not a subject&#13;
until the revolution in Portugal, and then lending started again.        So, in the&#13;
case of Portugal, there was a response, and what it proves to me, is the&#13;
importance of international public opinion.     The legal issue was not&#13;
controlling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            If the United Nations resolutions were recommendations that were not&#13;
binding on members, and they are not, they were certainly not binding on&#13;
outsiders like the Bank.     That was number one.   Number two: the members of the&#13;
Bank didn't act to carry these resolutions into effect.      The issue is whether&#13;
they could have, because they had a heavy political content.      Could the members&#13;
of the Bank have prevented the Bank from lending to Portugal and South Africa?&#13;
They had of course the power, but could they have properly exercised it?        It is&#13;
maybe an open question, but they didn't.     As I told the Indian delegate at the&#13;
Trusteeship Council during a coffee break, "Watch out, because if you look at&#13;
the voting record, you'll find that once or twice, your Director voted in favor&#13;
of a loan proposal or abstained, or was not heard from, but he didn't oppose."&#13;
The Trusteeship Council and the Bank Board are two different bodies, and the&#13;
representatives to each may think in good faith people that they act in&#13;
accordance with the charters governing them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     And the upshot was no real harm in relations with the UN?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, we ended the exchanges with the UN with an agreement to disagree&#13;
on the legal issue.     Woods wrote to the UN Secretary General saying that the&#13;
Executive Directors had seen the opinion--he called it a "closely reasoned&#13;
opinion"--of the UN Counsel and the opinion of the Bank's Counsel, and that the&#13;
Executive Directors, although with some exceptions and some dissents, accepted&#13;
the Bank's Counsel's opinion, but that this was no reason not to work closely to&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
realize their common aims.     You know, this was in a way shadowboxing, because&#13;
whatever some UN and Bank people liked to say, an large amount of work was and&#13;
is being done in close cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Were there other issues with specific governments in which you became&#13;
deeply involved in some memorable or precedent-setting way?        Was there any&#13;
problem with India?     Didn't it try once to repay part of its debt in rupees?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BORCHES:     No, it didn't try; we told them to.     It was one of George Woods' less&#13;
good ideas.     India was ready for a rescheduling exercise on its&#13;
intergovernmental debt, and the Bank was pushing the creditors to do that.         And&#13;
then Woods felt that the Bank couldn't push other people that hard without doing&#13;
something itself.     He encouraged the Indians to ask for some facilities which&#13;
involved the--I've forgotten the details--foreign exchange deposits in the&#13;
Central Bank in favor of the World Bank on terms which amounted to some&#13;
spreading-out of maturities, in effect.      The Indians were very unhappy.    They&#13;
said that they would of course     not default to the World Bank.     If they didn't&#13;
have enough funds, they would first pay the World Bank, and they didn't want&#13;
this facility.     But Woods talked them into it by saying that if the Bank showed&#13;
that it was willing to make a sacrifice, this would help to persuade the&#13;
governments to reschedule the Indian debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then a legal issue was raised.   One of the Directors said that while&#13;
the Articles talk about assistance to a country that was in financial&#13;
difficulty, it provided that the country had to ask for this assistance, and&#13;
that he was not aware of any such request having been made.        The Indians should&#13;
say that they were unable, because of foreign exchange shortages, to pay.          In&#13;
that case the Articles empowered the Bank to do certain things.       Well, George&#13;
Woods wanted a legal opinion, and I tendered a legal opinion, saying that the&#13;
Bank could do what any sensible banker would do, whatever seemed sensible in the&#13;
circumstances of financial difficulties of .a client, including some&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
rescheduling.     The Article provision in question dealt essentially with the&#13;
right of the member to ask for particular concession, rather than with the power&#13;
of the Bank to grant them.     For instance, in the Articles provision talking&#13;
about defaults by borrowers, it says that the first thing the Bank will do is to&#13;
make such arrangements as it thinks are indicated.     So the debate became one&#13;
over general powers, specific powers, restrictons on powers, a totally&#13;
unnecessary and useless debate since what we were proposing to do with the&#13;
Indians was one of the things that was specifically authorized under the&#13;
Articles, provided the Indians had asked for it.     George Woods pounded the table&#13;
and said that he was not going to ask one of our members "to swear out a&#13;
pauper's oath."    Well, you can see that those were not the most pleasant Board&#13;
meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But this was a kind of unique incident?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Yes, and I repeat that it was not something the Indians had asked for.&#13;
No, it was something we got ourselves into.&#13;

ASHER: The President got you into!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Bank personnel have on several occasions been involved in the drafting&#13;
or the development of multilateral investment insurance schemes.     In the 1950's,&#13;
I think, the General Counsel's office didn't see this as a great idea, but there&#13;
were subsequent pressures that brought it up again and again.     I wonder whether&#13;
you'd comment on your involvement, and on the way in which the institution&#13;
invokes its institutional memory when these things reappear--resurface from time&#13;
to time--and also the rationale for such a series.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Well, in the fifties there was a general concern about various ways to&#13;
promote private foreign investment, and there were basically three possible&#13;
approaches.     One, which was followed in the OECD at the instigation of the Swiss&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                      -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
and the Germans, was the code of good behavior, an agreement for the protection&#13;
of foreign property that defined the things you could do and couldn't do, mostly&#13;
the things you couldn't do, and "you" means developing countries.         The code&#13;
would have dealt with treatment of foreign property, including in paricular&#13;
transfer and expropriation.     It would have been an international treaty.       There&#13;
was no agreement, and the multilateral code approach had to be abandoned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The second approach was what the Bank concentrated on, which was&#13;
arbitration and conciliation.     That was mechanisms for resolving disputes.        Not&#13;
compulsory, but available.     Some questioned   w~ether   a dispute settlement&#13;
mechanism made sense in the absence of law--code of behaviour--to be applied by&#13;
that mechanism.     And the answer was, first, that waiting for the adoption of a&#13;
code of behavior was not a realistic alternative, and, secondly, that in an&#13;
evolving field like this, it was probably a good idea to move through the&#13;
development of principles by international tribunals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The third approach was entirely different.     It discounted a code of&#13;
good behavior, as well as a dispute settlement mechanism.        It envisaged&#13;
insurance of investors against political risk, such as expropriaton, certain&#13;
forms of foreign exchange control, or war.       The investor would not receive a&#13;
guarantee that these things wouldn't happen--and that's why it shouldn't be&#13;
called a guarantee system, it's really investment insurance--but he would be&#13;
made whole.     Those were the three approaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The OECD had already started working in 1958 on the code idea, which&#13;
was finally given up in 1967.     A resolution was adopted, to the effect that the&#13;
code gave a good statement of positive international law, but even within the&#13;
OECD there was no unanimity.     Spain--or Portugal--and Turkey abstained on the&#13;
resolution.    The other approach on which the OECD worked was investment&#13;
insurance.    Again in the fifties there were a number of proposals--as I&#13;
remember, they were all private proposals--for an investment insurance scheme,&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
multilateral investment insurance schemes.        Before getting deeply into that the&#13;
OECD asked the World Bank for a report.        That report was issued in 1961 or early&#13;
1962 and reviewed various plans.        I was involved throughout in that, and so were&#13;
Dick [Richard H.] Demuth and Shirley Boskey.        We went through these various&#13;
schemes, but the real question we were asked, more important than the merits or&#13;
demerits of the various ideas, was whether investment insurance as such had&#13;
merit, and whether the Bank could be involved in it.        The answer to the first&#13;
question was, frankly, we don't know.        It might be.   It's awfully hard to say.&#13;
If investors are looking for oil or minerals they may not have much choice of&#13;
where to go and investment insurance might not be crucial to their decision.              On&#13;
the other hand, if it's a question of industrial investment, or of marketing,&#13;
there's much more choice, and then the investment climate will make a greater&#13;
difference and investment insurance may encourage such        investment~    But there's&#13;
no statistical way of proving the value of investment insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Were there already at that stage national investment insurances?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     There were very few.    There was the U.S. scheme, under the foreign aid&#13;
legislation, and there was the German scheme, and the Japanese, and that was it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But was there any feeling that because there might be competition among&#13;
national schemes, that there should-be some obvious advantage in a multilateral&#13;
one?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No.   These were really private ideas ofm various people, and we had to&#13;
say that we didn't know what the value of insurance was.         Probably it could be&#13;
useful, in some cases.      In other cases, it might not be.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Just a brief aside.     I interviewed the Germans in 1962 or 1963.     Some&#13;
firms didn't insure anything.       They said they'd be self-insurers.      Some insured&#13;
everything, and both of them did well.       Some selected their risks, and they were&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
the ones who lost.     Some managements would rather face their board of directors&#13;
with extra costs for coverage than be exposed to criticism for not having&#13;
covered a policitical risk that with hindsight is likely to be called "clearly&#13;
foreseeable."     Others were more interested in keeping costs down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            We expressed reservations as to a possible role of the Bank.        I was the&#13;
one who felt most strongly that the Bank shouldn't be put in a position where it&#13;
was an insurer and a lender.     I mean, an insurer of money invested by others and&#13;
a lender to that country, which might disturb its relations with both.&#13;
Therefore, there should be a clear separation between the two functions.&#13;
Nothing happened for a while, and we started on ICSID and we finished it.           In&#13;
the meantime, the OECD had formulated a proposal for multilateral investment&#13;
insurance, and the U.S. supported it at the time.        It was not based on fear of&#13;
competition.     The reason for the U.S. to promote it was, on the contrary, that&#13;
they wanted a diversification of foreign capital flows, to increase these flows,&#13;
and also not to have U.S. capital stick out as the one foreign private investor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then there were the smaller countries which didn't have, and couldn't&#13;
afford to have, national schemes--or thought they couldn't afford to have them.&#13;
My own country, Holland, said while it was a small country, but it was home to&#13;
four of the largest companies of the world.        If those were insured, and&#13;
something went wrong, the national insurance scheme could close up shop.          For&#13;
that reason, they were particularly interested in risk sharing.        And others&#13;
were, too.     Also, risk sharing creates a certain solidarity among the investing&#13;
countries.     The fact that some countries had national systems was recognized,&#13;
but it didn't seem to matter.     Maybe they would want to reinsure part, or put&#13;
part in the international and part in the national scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Well, a draft was discussed in OECD.    I was interested, so I read the&#13;
papers.     But the Bank as such had nothing to do with it until UNCTAD in 1964 or&#13;
1965--I can't remember when it was--decided that the Bank should be asked to&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
look at the OECD package.     The OECD was very glad, because it had reached a&#13;
point where it couldn't go any further, so they handed the whole file over to&#13;
us.     Incidentally, the OECD had also asked us whether we would be prepared to&#13;
take over the code of good behavior.     That was in Woods' days, and I was the&#13;
spokesman for the Bank.     I said that we wouldn't do it, because the code was a&#13;
one-sided document limited to the protection of foreign property and the&#13;
obligations of the host countries.     If we were to take it over, we would have to&#13;
look at the other side, namely the obligations of investors.     The developing&#13;
countries would still feel that the Bank presented a proposal cooked up by their&#13;
adversaries, and the industrialized countries would accuse us of watering down a&#13;
wonderful document.    We were liable to end up by having everybody mad at us, or,&#13;
possibly even worse, coming out with a meaningless document.     So, we definitely&#13;
said no to that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Clausen--I don't know for what reason--in his first speech to the Board&#13;
of Governors, came back to that idea of a code of good conduct.       I don't know&#13;
who gave him that foolish notion, but he dropped it.     It was not in his prepared&#13;
speech, it was an insert.     I've never found out whose idea it was.   Maybe&#13;
somebody in the U.S. Treasury, but certainly not in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            But getting_back to the sixties and investment insurance, we got the&#13;
OECD package, and since ICSID was completed, we had time, and we started on&#13;
that.    We worked on it from 1966 'til 1973.   At first the meetings were chaired&#13;
by Woods, and then when McNamara came he found this whole subject so little to&#13;
his taste that he had me chair the meetings of the Committee of the Whole.&#13;
Normally, when these charters are negotiated, it is the Board of the Executive&#13;
Directors sitting as a committee â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

BROCHES:     Yes, we had the OECD version, we circulated it, and then Shirley&#13;
[Boskey) and Dick Demuth were the principal authors of a so-called principal&#13;
points paper.     You take the issues paper, and you go through that.    After that,&#13;
you have a draft, and you have meetings.     In fact, we had meetings extending&#13;
over seven years, most of which I chaired.     There were all sorts of&#13;
difficulties.     The main difficulty was that there were no great enthusiasts,&#13;
with the exception of Holland, which had since 1955 clamored for such an&#13;
institution and still does,     For the rest, countries moved in and out.    The U.S.&#13;
wss first in favor, then it was not in favor.       The British were in favor, but&#13;
then suddenly they decided that the last thing they wanted was to promote&#13;
capital export, so they dropped off.     Some devel?ping countries were opposed to&#13;
arbitration and subrogation.     Others were not, but it was never the same group.&#13;
I never had the same constituents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     The Pearson Commission, though, did endorse â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Yes, but that didn't help.   When Nixon was elected in 1968, the U.S.&#13;
administration, in accordance with what I am afraid has become a custom, said&#13;
that it had more urgent concerns and asked for a suspension of work, so for a&#13;
whole year we had no meetings.     Then, the the round of meetings started again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            In the meantime the U.S. had hardened its position, and required the&#13;
developing countries to share losses, something even the OECD had never&#13;
seriously considered.     It could have been in small amounts 1 but of course,&#13;
politically what it meant was to promote solidarity so that developing country A&#13;
would get angry at developing country B if it expropriated foreign property,&#13;
because country A would have to pay.     The Indians at one point--every country&#13;
changed its mind over the years--in the final period were very interested in&#13;
getting the institution set up, because they said that they suffer from the bad&#13;
behavior of other countries.     They did not object to international arbitration,&#13;
which they considered quite normal as a method of settling disputes between a&#13;
state and an international institution.     But they objected to loss-sharing.       If&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
India had caused a loss it would pay one hundred percent.     But if country x or&#13;
country y had confiscated foreign property, India would not be involved.        And&#13;
that was the breaking point, I think.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The U.S. was--and I've said this somewhere in writing--largely&#13;
responsible for the fact that nothing came about, but that was not entirely so.&#13;
Executive Directors and their countries simply became bored with the&#13;
interminable meetings at which nothing new emerged.     I found this particularly&#13;
frustrating, but in the absnece of directives from McNamara or of freedom to&#13;
take initiatives, we were treading water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Let me get back to your first question about national systems.     By the&#13;
late sixties there were plenty of national systems, which lessened the urgency&#13;
of a multilateral institution.     To put the issue in terms of an imaginary&#13;
dialogue, the developing countries said what are we buying?     Now we deal with&#13;
countries A, B, C, D, E.     It's true that there are nowadays syndicated&#13;
investments which may not fit into these national schemes.     If they fit, the&#13;
various partners don't have exactly the same protection, and that is a&#13;
constraint, true.     On the other hand, in a normal case, we can deal with the&#13;
various 'countries.   What do we buy?   We'll be confronted by the whole group of&#13;
industrialized capital-exporting countries if there is a dispute.     To which the&#13;
answer was yes, that's true.     On the other hsnd, you'll be on the Board.    You&#13;
won't hsve a determining vote, but you have voting rights, and you have speaking&#13;
rights, and you can help shape the policies of the institution.     Well, seeing&#13;
that we weren't going anywhere, several times I advised McNamara to stop.       And&#13;
he said, "No, let's just go on a little while."     I urged him to preside over a&#13;
meeting, being convinced that when he heard the discussion he would get very&#13;
impatient, and would have something to say to the Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            He said that he didn't want a confrontation, but that obviously, if&#13;
there was no mileage in the project, we should stop.     I then asked him whether&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
he would authorize me to say that he felt that one shouldn't go on spending time&#13;
and effort on this matter, but he preferred, for reasons I do not understand,&#13;
That I would keep the discussions going.     There were some very, very&#13;
controversial discussions, where the controversyÂ·was very clear, and at one&#13;
point, one of the Latin American Directors said that he thought this idea was&#13;
completely unacceptable.     I seized upon that, and said," Do I hear a motion?"&#13;
There was laughter, and I continued, "Do I hear a motion that would permit us to&#13;
take a decision whether we want to go on with the proposal?"      But nobody was&#13;
willing to take the responsiblilty for breaking off negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Well, finally McNamara decided that the time had come.   He didn't want&#13;
to have a Board meeting, because he was not sufficiently familiar with the&#13;
proposal.     So the matter was handled in writing.   A memorandum was circulated to&#13;
the Executive Directors stating that unless we got solid evidence of interest of&#13;
both the rich and the poor in going on, work on the proposal would be stopped.&#13;
It further said that interest meant willingness to compromise, not just interest&#13;
in the sense of yes, but only on our previously stated conditions.        Then, in the&#13;
absence of such indications of interest, we buried the thing mercifully in 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Why Clausen resurrected it in his inaugural speech, I don't know.&#13;
Again, nobody in the Bank did.     One of the reasons that was used for taking it&#13;
up again was that times had changed.     Well, they had changed, but in the wrong&#13;
direction, in my opinion.     While there was a greater need for private foreign&#13;
investment, institutional arrangements had hardened, and there were other ways&#13;
of dealing with the matter.     The eternal, at least perennial, obstacles were&#13;
loss-sharing, a link with the Bank--which in large part was a false issue, I&#13;
must say--arbitration of disputes, and subrogation.      Like any insurance company,&#13;
if you insure somebody and there's a loss, and you pay, you are subrogated in&#13;
the rights of the insured, which means the institution confronts the&#13;
"wrongdoer".     Then, if you can't come to an agreement, where do you go?     You go&#13;
to international arbitration, and those two things were unacceptable to Latin&#13;
Americans, and to certain others.&#13;

ASHER:     When the Bank picks up a subject after a lapse of a decade, do they&#13;
automatically, so to speak, call on the previous experience, or â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, apparently there were instructions to forget anything that had&#13;
gone on before.     So, laboriously, new people working on the project finally&#13;
found documents in files, but the name had to be changed, and it was totally&#13;
different.     I won't mention names, but even some very intelligent&#13;
people--friends of both yours and mine--said oh, but you know this is totally&#13;
different from the â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢    Well, the totally different turned out to be, for&#13;
example, that the first proposal envisaged that you would have some fifty or&#13;
sixty members, and the new one said that you would start with fewer.        I don't&#13;
think that's totally different.      I've been shown the current draft and there are&#13;
other non-differences--or cosmetic differences--like that.      I don't know where&#13;
it's going.     It was almost buried, but it's now apparently again being revived.&#13;
Of course something can be set up, but I just hope that it won't be done at the&#13;
expense of giving up on essential principles, such as the ones I mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            One reason why staff interest has been revived has to do with my second&#13;
or, really, third successor, Ibrahim [F. I.] Shihata, who knows the subject, and&#13;
has been very close to the only functioning international institution, which is&#13;
the Inter-Arab Guarantee Corporation.      I think that's the right name.    It's&#13;
functioning.     It's not functioning very actively; because it's main customer&#13;
would be Egypt, and relations between Egypt and the other Arab nations have been&#13;
bad.     I know that as of a few years ago they were hardly doing any business, but&#13;
it's soundly set up.      It is very conservative, and has all the things in it that&#13;
I and people more juridically minded would have in it.      But, I don't see that&#13;
it's acceptable.     I think it's fine, but I don't think it's acceptable.     Shihata&#13;
said to me, in a personal conversation, that he nevertheless wanted to see&#13;
whether this couldn't be done.     And he is certainly not one to overlook anything&#13;
that's happened in the past.     He's one of the most conscientious and thorough&#13;
lawyers I know,&#13;

&#13;
ASHER:     Well, maybe this does bring us logically--or illogically--to a baby of&#13;
yours, on which you might have a lot to say: ICSID.     We've mentioned it briefly&#13;
before, but it came into being toward the end of George Woods' presidency.        You&#13;
were largely responsible, I think, for its creation, and you served as its&#13;
Secretary-General from 1967 to 1980.     What can you tell us about its origin, its&#13;
creation, its most novel features?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Well, in part, it follows from what I said earlier about the third&#13;
approach.     It's not the code, it's not the insurance, it's the mechanism for&#13;
settlement of disputes.     We'd had a little experience with it in the Bank.&#13;
Black had been asked to intervene--to assist rather--in the settlement of some&#13;
disputes, not by way of arbitration--we always said that was impossible--but as&#13;
a conciliator.     But in some cases of conciliation, although what comes out of&#13;
the work is a recommendation which is not binding, it may in fact be binding if&#13;
it's the last resort of the parties.     That was the case of the settlement of the&#13;
compensation claims in the Suez Canal, and a dispute regarding a Japanese bond&#13;
issue, which had been litigated in France and Japan for twenty years without&#13;
result.     Although Japan and the French bondholders just asked for conciliation&#13;
by Black, obviously this was the last chance, and they accepted what he&#13;
recommended.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Well, since we were under general pressure to do something in the field&#13;
of encouragement of foreign investment, I thought dispute settlement was the&#13;
least controversial approach, and also something that wouldn't require a large&#13;
organization.     It wouldn't require money, and I thought it was something that&#13;
the Bank ought to take up.     I think I sent the first note to Black in 1961, and&#13;
gradually the Board became reconciled to the fact that they would get a lot of&#13;
legal papers, and we started discussing the outlines of a proposal.     Then Black&#13;
left, in December, 1962.     All that existed was a resolution of the Board&#13;
Governors, saying that this was something that ought to be looked into, no more&#13;
than that.&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
            Then George Woods came.     He said that the idea appealed to him but that&#13;
he had to learn so many things, that he didn't want to talk to me about it until&#13;
he felt that he understood it.        He really educated himself on the subject&#13;
--amazingly well--and had himself examined by me, had test luncheons with the&#13;
Executive Directors in which he explained the proposal, requesting me not to&#13;
intervene unless he went too far afield, and he would take the Executive&#13;
Directors in order of importance.        By the time he had the Big Five at luncheon,&#13;
he was perfect, and he said to me that he also understood what he was saying.&#13;
By the fifth luncheon--! think we had five luncheons--he really knew the&#13;
subject.    He said that he was now ready to preside at meetings, although he&#13;
would still let me do most of the talking.       Well, then we did start talking, and&#13;
drafts were circulated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Let me say what some of the basic elements were.     First, the system was&#13;
to be embodied in a convention, a treaty.       Then, the fact that a state signed&#13;
the treaty and ratified the treaty, didn't oblige that state or any of its&#13;
nationals to submit any disputes either for conciliation or arbitration under&#13;
the convention, but when the government of the contracting state agreed with an&#13;
investor to submit existing or future disputes, then that became a treaty&#13;
obligation for that party, and an irrevocable commitment.        Now, if you have an&#13;
irrevocable commitment to go to arbitration, it means that you can't walk away&#13;
from it, and that if you try to walk away from it, an arbitral tribunal will&#13;
still be formed.     If an unwilling party doesn't appear before the tribunal, the&#13;
tribunal will still examine the case, although the fact that a party doesn't&#13;
appear doesn't mean that the the tribunal will assume that the other party is&#13;
right.     The other party will have to prove its case, to the extent that that's&#13;
possible in the absence of the defaulter.        If a decision is reached and an award&#13;
rendered--and this is true whether it was with both parties present or one--the&#13;
                                                                                  '&#13;
award is binding, and not subject to review by any national court, although it&#13;
is subject to review, in exceptional circumstances, by another entity under the&#13;
convention.     That means, once again, international adjudication.     And the first&#13;
instance of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
this has just occurred.     There was a case between a German company and Cameroon.&#13;
There was a decision in which the company claim was denied and it is now seeking&#13;
to have that award annulled.     It's a very special procedure, whereby a special&#13;
committee has to be appointed.     But that, once again, is outside national&#13;
courts.     It's under the aegis of ICSID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Well, after the draft had been discussed for a while, the Executive&#13;
Directors were showing signs of getting bored, because they didn't have proper&#13;
feedback from home.     Executive Directors report to Ministries of Finance, and&#13;
while the purpose of the exercise was developmental, the technique was not only&#13;
legal, but procedural.     It was particularly difficult for people who are not&#13;
lawyers, or who are lawyers but not interested in procedural matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then we hit on the idea of taking the show on the road to get comments&#13;
from member countries, because we didn't get them through the Directors, and&#13;
also to relieve the Directors of the tedium of having to go over this thing all&#13;
the time.     I have to take credit for the idea of having four regional&#13;
consultative meetings in the four capitals of the U.N.: Geneva, Santiago,&#13;
Bangkok, and Addis Ababba.     The Bank paid for up to two experts for one week-&#13;
-travel and subsistence--and the meetings were chaired by the Bank.      Woods said&#13;
that since he was not a lawyer, he had instructed the General Counsel to be in&#13;
the chair.     I had two and sometimes three other lawyers with me.   It was a bit&#13;
like a traveling circus.     We traveled to those four places with the same&#13;
program.     We had an opening reception.    I called on the Ministers of Foreign&#13;
Affairs and Justice.     We went through the text, received frequently the same&#13;
comments and gave the same answers.     There was no voting at these meetings.      In&#13;
addition to comments, suggestions were advanced, and some compromises were&#13;
reached, but all in the framework of consultations.      The representatives of&#13;
countries were not really representing these countries, they were experts-&#13;
designate.     Some were as high as cabinet members, others were professors, or&#13;
private lawyers, or they could be anything.      But the consultative meetings gave&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
an enormous amount of useful information.     After these four meetings, I wrote a&#13;
report to the Board--and I didn't do all these things alone, I had two or three&#13;
people working with me--in which I said that on the basis of these reports of&#13;
the consultative meetings, I was satisfied that it would be possible to work out&#13;
something that would command wide support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The Board endorsed that, and then we went to the Annual Meeting in&#13;
Tokyo in 1964, where incidentally, the decision on grants to IDA was also taken.&#13;
The Governors approved a resolution instructing the Executive Directors to draft&#13;
a treaty and to submit it to governments for such action as they saw fit.        I&#13;
knew what action I wanted, but we left the language neutral.     Since the&#13;
Directors had become no more expert that they were before, we inserted another&#13;
mechanism in order to help them, in the form of a Legal Committee made up of&#13;
experts     who this time would be representing governments, rather than just being&#13;
designated by them.     They sat for three weeks, morning and afternoon, most of&#13;
the time, and went through more drafts, and came out with a document that was&#13;
handed to the Executive Directors as the advice of the Legal Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Now, there was a constitutional and legal problem involved, and that&#13;
was: how would that Legal Committee vote?     Should it vote on the basis of one&#13;
country, one vote?     No, because any decisions taken in the Bank are based on&#13;
weighted voting.     Well, weighted voting didn't make any sense either, because&#13;
not every country might send a representative to the Legal Committee.        I mean,&#13;
they were entitled to do so, and the Bank even paid for the travel and&#13;
subsistence, but if their votes were disregarded, the Executive Directors&#13;
wouldn't get the proper picture.     So the decision was that there would be no&#13;
vote, although the chairman had the right to ask for indications of views of&#13;
delegates.     In practice, it was hands up, hands down all the time, and with it&#13;
was immediately accepted that if there appeared to be a majority for a&#13;
particular proposition, and opponents did not consider it to be of essential&#13;
interest, then that would be regarded as decided.     On the other hand, regardless&#13;

of whether there was a majority or not, if some countries that were opposed felt&#13;
that a very important issue was involved, it would simply be reported to the&#13;
Executive Directors.     This voting-non-voting system was pretty innovative, and&#13;
it worked well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But in the light of subsequent Latin American attitudes, and preceding&#13;
ones too, toward any multilateral forum for investment dispute settlement, had&#13;
they previously given you the impression that they would.go along with it more&#13;
than they did?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    No, on the contrary, in Tokyo in 1964, the Latin Americans opposed, en&#13;
masse,the resolution that was before the Board instructing the Directors to&#13;
draft a convention, and this became known in the Latin American press as El No&#13;
de Tokyo.     The fact that they acted largely on the basis of false information&#13;
doesn't matter, because if they'd had the right information, they would still&#13;
have voted against it.    Apparently most of them had been told that, if this&#13;
resolution were adopted, every Latin American country would be obliged to bring&#13;
all investment disputes before the World Bank.      But even if they'd known of the&#13;
much more modest scope of the proposal, they would also have been opposed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            During the consultative meeting in Santiago, I heard objections that if&#13;
this convention came about, although it might not be compulsory, the countries&#13;
that didn't sign it wouldn't get Bank loans.     If they signed, but didn't submit&#13;
disputes, they wouldn't get Bank loans.    Well, in the first two years after&#13;
that, lending to Latin America shot up by 250 percent.     Clear proof that there&#13;
was no link whatever between Bank operations and attitudes towards the&#13;
convention.    No, there was a deep-seated distrust, and dislike, and just&#13;
traditional Latin American philosophical, legal, and political ideas, and it&#13;
hasn't changed.    There are a few Latin American countries that have now signed,&#13;
but those who say that this is a radical change are wrong.     There is no radical&#13;
change.&#13;

BROCHES:     Oh, Israel held out for various reasons.       Israel held out because with&#13;
the rather dirigiste, or quite dirigiste government, they had an abivalent&#13;
attitude to private investment.        Furthermore, they took the position that since&#13;
Israel was not going to hurt foreign investors, so it was not necessary to join&#13;
ICSID in order to attract foreign investment.          When I pointed out that there&#13;
were Israeli investors who invested in Africa, they said that that was another&#13;
reason why they wouldn't join.        Heaven knows what such investors might do, and&#13;
Israel needed friends, not enemies.        The investors would have to fend for&#13;

ASHER:     But this isn't litigation â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes, it is litigation.     Arbitration is litigation.     I mean it's a&#13;
confrontation of two legal positions, resolved by third party adjudication of&#13;
the dispute.     The decision is made by arbitrators rather than by a state court,&#13;
but the decision is binding.       McNamara says that he does not believe that&#13;
litigation is the best way to solve investment disputes.         He is right, if that&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
means that one should make every effort to reach an amicable settlement.       But he&#13;
believes that law is     irrelevant.   McNamara wants to get what he wants, he has&#13;
shown this throughout his career, by any means.      I won't say by illegal means,&#13;
but I'm sure that one of the reasons--he will deny it, but I'm convinced--why he&#13;
doesn't like litigation is that while you might win, you might also lose, and he&#13;
doesn't like losing.     It's the reason why he foolishly held out as long as he&#13;
could against the creation of an Administrative Tribunal.       When he finally had&#13;
to give in, he received no credit for his decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Maybe this is an unfair question, but how could you give as much time&#13;
and thought, and travel, and so on to ICSID as you appear to have given, and&#13;
still do your full duty as General Counsel and Vice President of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     The ICSID work was largely concentrated betweenÂ· 1963 and 1965, when it&#13;
was a priority project of the Bank.     More importantly, we had a very broad and&#13;
deep top at the Legal Department.      I can say that now. I always denied it then,&#13;
because I wanted to broaden it further, and the personnel people said that we&#13;
had too many senior staff.     I needed it, because there were all these roles for&#13;
the Legal Department: in addition to normal    opera~ional   work there were the&#13;
President's Council, relations with the Board, questions of interpretation of&#13;
the Articles of Agreement, the Annual Meetings, and special problemscropping up&#13;
from time to time, such as China, valuation of capital, review of borrowing&#13;
instruments, a great variety of subjects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But those are things that are hard to delegate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Well, no, I wouldn't say so.   It depends what you mean by delegate.&#13;
You can leave matters to your closest colleagues if they know your way of&#13;
thinking.    They have their instructions and can go very far in supplying the&#13;
details, or get instructions as to those with a five minute conversation or&#13;
telephone call.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     No, I was really thinking of it from the point of view of a President of&#13;
the Bank, or Executive Directors, who think the General Counsel is at their&#13;
right hand most of the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     The Executive Directors certainly do not think so.    Nearly all&#13;
contacts between Executive Directors and the General Counsel are at the&#13;
initiative of the latter.     The President, or rather McNamara, would hint, but&#13;
never say outright, that he would like to see me travel less.       He traveled a&#13;
great deal himself, so that if you happened to be away when he was in Washington&#13;
there might be a long gap.     I managed to be at most of the Board meetings&#13;
myself.     If I had been away, I would return as did McNamara, the eve of the&#13;
weekly Board meeting. During absences from Washington       I talked frequently to&#13;
Lester [Nurick], or Piero Sella.     I would phone from the country where I was,&#13;
and I knew exactly what would be on the agenda, what the issues were and to what&#13;
extent the Legal Department was involved.      The bulk of the Legal Department's&#13;
work is routine in the sense that it does not need close attention by the&#13;
General Counsel.     It is therefore normal that the General Counsel concentrates&#13;
his own activity on a few priority issues such as, in my case, valuation of the&#13;
Bank's capital, matters of audit, the so-called Kafka Committee and the like in&#13;
the last years of my incumbency.     As it happened, now that I mention them, I was&#13;
in disagreement with McNamara on most of them.       I understand that [Ibrahim F.&#13;
I.] Shihata travels at least as much as I did, but, like me, is in full control&#13;
of the Legal Department.&#13;

ASHER:     Let me wrap up ICSID, if I can â&#128;¢. You've been out of it for a while.&#13;
Looking back on your frustations, on your satisfactions, in the operation of the&#13;
agency, how do you evaluate it in terms of your own experience with it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Oh, I'm very happy about it.   I never thought that it would become an&#13;
institution that would have an enormous amount of business.       I never expected&#13;
it, and I never said otherwise.     There are reasons, which would take me too&#13;
long--because they're all technical--to explain.      But basically, there couldn't&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
have been disputes in the beginning, because there couldn't have been contracts&#13;
which referred to the Convention.     There weren't enough parties yet to the&#13;
Convention.     In addition, there's a honeymoon period in investment agreements.&#13;
This explains amply why in the beginning there weren't any eases.      Now, if there&#13;
hadn't been any eases for ten years, you would have sounded defensive explaining&#13;
it, even though the explanation was valid.      In fact, the first ease wasn't&#13;
registered until five years after the Convention entered into force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            What would have been bad, was a refusal by countries and investors to&#13;
provide for recourse to ICSID in ease of disputes arising in the future, and&#13;
that was not the ease.     There are large numbers of countries which have made&#13;
these commitments.     If there are no disputes, so much the better.   In some eases&#13;
there are disputes, but they don't come to ICSID, even though there's an&#13;
agreement to take them to ICSID.     Why?   Because at the last moment, both sides&#13;
realized that they may win or may lose, and make a last effort at settlement,&#13;
which is often successful.     Generally, an ironclad commitment to go to a court&#13;
or to arbitration is a strong incentive to settlement.      The preventive value of&#13;
these institutions is very great.     It's also interesting that a number of ICSID&#13;
proceedings were discontinued after the parties reached a settlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Now, is the International Council on Commercial Arbitration, with which&#13;
you have some current connections, an outgrowth, a parallel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, it has absolutely nothing to do with it.   That is a committee of&#13;
experts on international commercial arbitration, involving both private-private&#13;
and private-government disputes.     No, it has nothing to do with ICSID.   The&#13;
Council is interested in national legislation, whereas ICSID is entirely in the&#13;
international sphere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The number of eases before ICSID is accelerating, exactly for the&#13;
reasons that there are more countries, there has been more time to get into&#13;

disagreements, and there are more contracts,            Now, I don't know, there are&#13;
sixteen or seventeen cases, I think.         When I left--and that's only three years&#13;
ago--there were nine.      And these are all big cases.       You can't go to ICSID with&#13;
an ordinary commercial case.      These are all very complicated cases, and they may&#13;
take some years.      That number is increasing.     Although I'm no longer connected&#13;
with ICSID, I'm president of an arbitral tribunal in one case and I'm counsel in&#13;
two other cases, so I've not lost â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Not out of touch, but coming from outside.        No, I think it's been&#13;
useful.     It has had more attention in legal periodicals than in business&#13;
periodicals, and that's partly my fault.        Also, doctoral     theses have been&#13;
written about it, because it was very innovative, and there are all sorts of&#13;
wrinkles that are very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     Theses?   Where, did you say?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Doctoral theses, yes.   There's one in Germany.       There's one in France,&#13;
there's one in Japan, that I know of, and many masters papers, and so forth, and&#13;
law review articles.      Oh, the list of publications is enormous.       The&#13;
bibliography is enormous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     It exceeds the number of cases by far.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Yes, but you know, you ought to compare ICSID with the International&#13;
Court rather than with, say, the International Chamber of Commerce, or the&#13;
American Arbitration Association.         There is no routine type of case that's bound&#13;
to go there.     Woods, rightly, always called this a modest proposal, but it's one&#13;
of the things that can be, and has been, helpful.           There's one other thing I&#13;
should mention.      There are now about sixty treaties between states, generally&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
industrialized and developing, which provide for access to ICSID in case of&#13;
disputes about violations of the treaties.     And those treaties are investment&#13;
protection treaties.     So, ICSID has an enormous potential clientele.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     You indicated that McNamara's interest was less than intense, and I&#13;
guess that's understandable in the light of the emphasis he put on the&#13;
tremendous expansion in Bank lending and borrowing, personnel, and generally&#13;
building up the Bank and IDA during his turbulent presidency.      Aside from ICSID,&#13;
what do you regard as the principal set of pluses and minuses in the McNamara&#13;
era?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:      Before I answer the question, let me say that I don't consider his&#13;
lack of interest in ICSID a minus.     It didn't really hurt.   One of the reasons&#13;
why he didn't want to come out for ICSID--I think he wanted me to be aggressive,&#13;
which I didn't think was the role of the Secretary-General, and he felt that if&#13;
he played a visible role it would have been activist or aggressive--is that he&#13;
saw himself as the friend of the poor, and since ICSID had to do with private&#13;
investment, he did not like to have identified himself as Chairman of the&#13;
Administrative Council of ICSID.     I once said that to an Executive Vice&#13;
President of IFC, the late Bill [William C.] Gaud, who laughed and asked me&#13;
whether I didn't realize that he had never spoken as President of IFC, because&#13;
it's private.     Inside the institution he took a great interest in private&#13;
investment and IFC's role in the private sector, but this was not to tarnish his&#13;
image for the outside world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            In Nairobi, in 1973, when he had just made his great poverty speech, he&#13;
asked me how he could show some interest, in a decent way, in private&#13;
investment?     Bankers and other private sector people had been talking to him&#13;
about it.     He was troubled because he didn't consider his Annual Meeting&#13;
addresses State of the World speeches in which he would devote a paragraph to&#13;
this, a paragraph to that.     He had to have a theme, such as poverty,&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                           -46-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
agriculture, or human rights.        If he was going to speak about private investment&#13;
he had to devote more than a paragraph to it,             But where could he do it?&#13;
Certainly not at an Annual Meeting.          I suggested that he make a speech at a&#13;
finance forum in New York, London or Zurich.             Bankers would be falling all over&#13;
themselves to provide him with the proper platform.             But he did nothing of the&#13;
kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I guess he had just decided he'd rather let other people play that&#13;
role.     He had some pretty articulate IFC people, but it would have helped IFC if&#13;
he had openly shown an interest in its affairs.            Well, that was a minus, I&#13;
think.     Apart from the private investment area, I would say that there were very&#13;
big pluses, and very big minuses in his administration,            I think that the&#13;
biggest minus--because it's the most recent--was his drive for ever-expanding&#13;
activities, for continuous growth, in total disregard of what members, who have&#13;
to provide the money, wanted.        He has done a miraculous job of bluffing, of&#13;
forcing the U.S. to go along with him, but obviously there would come a time&#13;
when that would no longer work, and we're in that period right now.            And I think&#13;
that that would have been true under the Carter administration as well as the&#13;
Reagan one.     He was telling the    u.s.   what they'd got to do, even on legal&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I don't know if I mentioned that to you, but he once wanted me to give&#13;
the U.S. Treasury a legal opinion on U.S. budget law, and tell them that they&#13;
had to accept my opinion because this was a matter which directly interested the&#13;
Bank!     Can you imagine anything more unrealistic?!         Of course that is not to say&#13;
that I wasn't currently arguing with the Treasury about their interpretation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But what about the direction of lending?         I assume that there is a real&#13;
problem.     You can't expand total lending forever, but he also changed&#13;
substantially the direction and the purposes for which loans were made,&#13;

BROCHES:      Well, do you really think he did it that much?      I have a feeling it&#13;
was all much more gradual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:      Well, the rhetoric was changed 100 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:      Yes, the rhetoric was changed.     But, you know, you filter that out,&#13;
and I'm sure that I couldn't repeat it, I just didn't listen to the rhetoric, I&#13;
looked at what we were doing, and, well, there were some excursions into the&#13;
field of energy.         There, the poor World Bank was also buffeted, and in this ease&#13;
by the U.S., with Kissinger.         At one time he wanted to go this way, then he went&#13;
the other way, and the Bank tried to follow, more or less.          There was the&#13;
excitement about a resources bank which flopped, which was nothing.          Then the&#13;
Bank was subject to violent attacks, mostly from Exxon, when it started             talking&#13;
about lending to countries to help them become partners, or joint venturers, in&#13;
oil exploration and oil exploitation.         This was said to be terrible, because it&#13;
was socialism.      Companies could do it themselves, and the fact that the Bank was&#13;
going to do it with countries where the companies didn't want to go didn't&#13;
matter.      The Bank was subject to very unfair attacks, I think.      I'm not sure&#13;
that the whole oil industry agreed with Exxon; but Exxon was the one that spoke&#13;
out loudest.&#13;

BROCHES:      Exactly.    And now there is Special Action, and that is emergency&#13;
assistance, of the kind, as I understand it, which would, for instance, take&#13;
care of export shortfalls, or cost overruns, which is something the Bank said it&#13;
would never do.      And now it's called Special Action Program.      There are a lot of&#13;
labels put to things that are not all that new.&#13;

ASHER:     There were two new things under McNamara, that you may or may not have a&#13;
comment on: the establishment of the CGIAR--the Consultative Group on&#13;
International Agricultural Research--and the initiation of the World Development&#13;
Report.     Would you give those as pluses, or â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     On the World Development Report, I don't know what else is available,&#13;
so I can't judge the comparative merits.      As a matter of fact, I would be&#13;
interested some time to hear a critique or an evaluation of that.        I think the&#13;
CGIAR was a typical plus.     It was a great plus, and typical of McNamara's way of&#13;
getting things done.     You know, if he had an idea, he would find ways of getting&#13;
it done, of getting people together, and getting it organized.        I think that was&#13;
one of his great merits.     When I talked about the largest minus, it was just his&#13;
ruthless way of going about it, which was bound to lead to reactions which, as I&#13;
said, we are now suffering from.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I saw him in January 1968, before he joined--he came April 1,&#13;
1968--because I went to the Pentagon with two Directors to show him his&#13;
contract.     He signed it, but later denied having read it.     That's quite&#13;
possible, but I had occasion to tell him that his not having read it didn't&#13;
meant that he was not bound by it.      He probably thought that mine was a&#13;
legalistic argument.&#13;

until late at night.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Oh, not legal documents.   He may even have preferred not to know the&#13;
details.    What was characteristic is that three months before taking up his job&#13;
at the Bank he had all his quantitative targets for the first five year plan&#13;
ready.&#13;

BROCHES.     I went to the Pentagon with two Directors, the Dean and the Deputy&#13;
Dean of the Board.     Luis MachadÂ·o, a Cuban, was the Dean, and Lieftinck, the&#13;
Dutch Director, was the Deputy Dean.     You know, Lieftinck is a very solemn man,&#13;
and he spoke earnestly and solemnly to McNamara.       He said to McNamara that&#13;
everybody had heard of his great organizing capabilities.        The current&#13;
President, Mr. Woods, was a very dynamic man, and had advanced the work of the&#13;
Bank very much and it had expanded very rapidly, and they were now looking&#13;
forward to a period of consolidation, under McNamara's administrative and&#13;
managerial genius.     Well, I thought McNamara would die.     His eyes clouded over,&#13;
and he was silent.     Then he started a big speech.    "Dr. Lieftinck, Dr. Machado,"&#13;
he said, "the World Bank has a great potential for development," and he started&#13;
laying out his five year plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     He also introduced a major reorganization in the Bank, in 1972, which&#13;
made you a Vice President as well as General Counsel.        Did this change any of&#13;
your duties, or was.it just public relations?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     No, what happens is, when you hire McKinsey and you pay them two&#13;
million dollars, they have to make additional Vice Presidents.        They have to do&#13;
something for the money--sorry to be so cynical.       The management structure goes&#13;
back to George Woods and the President's Council.       In 1964 George Woods&#13;
established the President's Council, which was not a decision-making body, but a&#13;
forum for exchange of information and ideas at top management level.        At that,&#13;
there was more staff input under Woods than subsequently under McNamara.          In the&#13;
beginning, the Woods Council met every day, and then once a week.        It consisted&#13;
of Burke Knapp, as the lending man, Siem Aldewereld as the project man, plus&#13;
three staff people.     So, there were only two line officers and three staff.        The&#13;
three staff people were the Economic Advisor, the Legal Advisor, and Dick&#13;
Demuth, who was the brains trust.     Then, it was somewhat enlarged, and under&#13;
McNamara it was further enlarged, particularly after the 1972 reorganization.&#13;

[BROCHES]&#13;
            The big issue in the Bank was the relation between projects and&#13;
programs.     A strong management would have resolved the issue and put its&#13;
solution into effect.     A weak management in these matters--and McNamara is not&#13;
strong in such matters--hires management consultants, tells them what is wanted,&#13;
generally obtains the desired advice and then introduces the solution suggested&#13;
by expert opinion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I'll get back to the merits of the reorganization, which I think were&#13;
very substantial, but I'll finish my answer about the effect of the title change&#13;
on my position, which was nil.     When the McKinsey exercise took place, the&#13;
regions were created, and the heads of these regions were called Vice&#13;
Presidents, but they reported to somebody who was not called Senior Vice&#13;
President, although that would have described him correctly, and that was Burke&#13;
Knapp.     McKinsey added more Vice-Presidential titles, which also constituted&#13;
promotions at the time.     McNamara said that for Hollis [Chenery]--Hollis was the&#13;
Economic Advisor--and me the title Vice President did not mean a promotion.         He&#13;
wondered whether we would be willing to do without the title, which wouldn't&#13;
affect our influence, rank or pay, and would make his job with the Board easier,&#13;
since it wasn't keen on having so many Vice Presidents.     However, these things&#13;
matter to the outside world, and McNamara agreed to include us.      The circular&#13;
that came out listed the officers who had been promoted, and stated that the&#13;
titles of Messrs. Chenery and Broches had been changed to Vice President, to&#13;
make very clear that we had been at that level before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     But in terms of elevating regional problems, do you think the&#13;
reorganization was useful?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Oh, yes.   There was a need to create a basis for operational&#13;
responsibility with power to manage the two sides, projects and programs, of the&#13;
Bank's lending programs.      The Regions were created to solve what had really&#13;
become an intolerable situation.      Burke and I had suggested a much simpler&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                       -51-&#13;

&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
solution in 1965, but that was not tried out.        The projects side and the&#13;
programs side needed to coordinate their activities by consultation, or to be&#13;
coordinated.     The programs side wanted to make a loan to Thailand for railways,&#13;
but projects said that to their regret their railway resources were occupied&#13;
with Chile.     This is a typical example.   Also, of course, the projects people&#13;
tended to be perfectionists.     The programs people were concerned with country&#13;
interests, painting with a broader brush.      Differences between the two sides&#13;
were not resolved until they came to the very top.       It was a very, very&#13;
inefficient system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Again, there would have been other ways to solve the situation, but it&#13;
was probably necessary to make a radical change.       So, I think that it was all to&#13;
the good to give these Regional Vice Presidents the staff resources, so that&#13;
they could be held accountable.     They had a projects unit and a programs unit&#13;
both under their control and it was up to them to manage these resources in such&#13;
a way that they could carry out their lending programs, which they were also&#13;
responsible for drawing up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then there was Warren Baum's shop, the Central Projects Department.       It&#13;
was to exercise policy and quality control.     McKinsey had proposed that the&#13;
latter should come under Hollis Chenery. Â· McNamara      submitted this proposal to a&#13;
big professional staff meeting, at which everybody, including the economists,&#13;
thought that it belonged to Operations.      I suspect that McNamara had tricked&#13;
McKinsey into thinking that their recommendation was what he wanted.       McKinsey&#13;
even called it their most important recommendation, and McNamara said that he&#13;
would not accept it.     It certainly created an impression of arms-length&#13;
dealing .â&#128;¢â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:      One administrative innovation that we haven't mentioned is the&#13;
Administrative Tribunal, with which you had a lot to do, I think.       How did that&#13;
come about?&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                      -52-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     You know, the question should really be how it came about that the&#13;
Bank didn't have an Administrative Tribunal much earlier, as is the case of all&#13;
international organizations in the world, except for the financial ones created&#13;
under U.S. sponsorship.     The other international organizations have staff rules&#13;
and generally two tiers of review of disputes between organization and staff.&#13;
The Bank didn't have staff regulations.     There were, and maybe still are, big&#13;
binders with what are called policies and procedures statements, which aren't&#13;
very clear, and there were no provisions for review of management decisions&#13;
affecting a staff member.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The second was thus what would happen if a staff member felt that he&#13;
was being unfairly dealt with, or in violation of his terms of appointment.&#13;
Where could he go?    Generally speaking, if an employee disagrees with his&#13;
employer, and feels that the employer is not living up to his legal obligations,&#13;
he or she goes to court.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Now, I didn't want the staff members to go to national courts, because&#13;
depending on their residence they might be able to go to court in different&#13;
countries.    These courts might reach totally different decisions on identical&#13;
cases because they would each be applying their own law.    My view was--I say my&#13;
view, because I was the one to express it, not because there was something&#13;
special about it--that the relationship between the staff in an international&#13;
organization is governed by the internal law of the organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Unfortunately the Bank didn't have, and maybe still doesn't have, a&#13;
readable statement of the rights and obligations of the employee.     It still had&#13;
little bits and pieces of paper called Policies and Procedures Statement Number&#13;
X, Y or Z, which may be five years out of date.     I considered this an example of&#13;
poor administration, but it didn't mean that it was impossible to decide what&#13;
their rights and obligations were.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
            The real question was before which forum, if any, disputes regarding&#13;
these rights and obligations were to be litigated.        For the reasons stated, I&#13;
felt that they should not be brought before national jurisdictions and I stated&#13;
that if a staff member sued the Bank in a national court, I would argue that the&#13;
court had no jurisdiction, since the relationship was one governed by&#13;
international law.     But was there any forum, and should there be any other&#13;
forum?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I debated that with my recent colleague [Purviz N.] Damry, the&#13;
Secretary of the Bank, in a President's Council meeting.        His answer was that&#13;
the recourse for a staff member was the exercise of sound discretion by the&#13;
Bank's management.     I'm sure that Mrs. Gandhi would have been quite happy with&#13;
that response.     I couldn't understand it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The question had been discussed for a long time, but there weren't many&#13;
disputes, or at least none that came to the attention of people like myself, who&#13;
were asked to intervene.     But, around 1960 I think, I began to worry about it,&#13;
and said that we ought to do something.        For instance, we might join the&#13;
Administrative Tribunal of the UN.     All successive Directors of&#13;
Administration--at that time the issue never came to a President--were shocked&#13;
at the idea that their actions could be reviewed.       How can we manage this&#13;
institution?     How could they manage the institution and write frank evaluation&#13;
reports?     Practically every Vice President had the same reaction when the issue&#13;
came, much later, to the President's Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            At first, it was a fairly low-pressue discussion between the Legal&#13;
Department and the Personnel Department.        But that did not get us anywhere.     We&#13;
had a plan to write Staff Regulations.     We were met by the same negative&#13;
reaction.     How could the managers manage a staff governed by regulations?        It&#13;
would reduce flexibility.     In order to show that the problem was not so&#13;
difficult, we did a mock-up of regulations--this was done by one of my&#13;
&amp;#12;BROCHES                                      -54-&#13;

colleagues, who left us for the UN, and who is the greatest international&#13;
proceduralist known to man or God--and he did a mock-up of some sections.        It&#13;
didn't get anywhere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then the Staff Association was formed.   Strangely enough, I don't at&#13;
this moment recall the origin of the Staff Association, but obviously it was&#13;
formed because there was a feeling that the staff was not always satisfied, and&#13;
wanted to be able to speak with a collective voice.     I continued talking about a&#13;
staff tribunal, and I said that the proper thing, of course, would be to have an&#13;
independent tribunal, like the national tribunals to which national civil&#13;
servants can appeal actions taken by the administration.     The UN Tribunal seemed&#13;
to represent the best solution, but if that was not acceptable the Bank might&#13;
set up its own tribunal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I met with continued resistance, and accepted that, as a first step, we&#13;
should set up a joint staff committee that could hear grievances and make&#13;
recommendations to the management.     The Appeals Committee that was formed is&#13;
composed of three staff members, one selected by the Staff Association, one by&#13;
the management, and one jointly appointed.     The Appeals Committee reaches&#13;
decisions which are non-binding recommendations to the President, who can accept&#13;
or reject them.    The practice now, as far as I know, is to accept them almost&#13;
blindly, unless they should be completely irrational.     Nevertheless, legally,&#13;
the Committee's conclusions are not binding.     They are recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I kept urging the creation of a formal Administrative Tribunal, and&#13;
finally the Vice President of Administration was, as he called it himself,&#13;
pulled screaming over the line.     Most of the Vice Presidents still thought that&#13;
this would destroy their authority over their staff.     McNamara was very&#13;
uncertain.    He didn't like it.   He said he wasn't sure that it was prudent.&#13;

&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
            In the meantime, the Bank was being sued by a staff member in U.S.&#13;
District Court, and there was a threat that the Staff Association would appear&#13;
amicus curiae in court.     While we had instructed our outside lawyers--Wilmer,&#13;
Cutler and Pickering--to plead absence of jurisdiction, I felt that the Staff&#13;
Association, represented by Surrey and Morse--the latter a former Director&#13;
General of the ILO [International Labour Organization]--could cause us serious&#13;
trouble by pointing out that the Bank denied its staff any possibility to have&#13;
recourse to impartial third party dispute resolution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The last thing Martin Paijmans, Vice President of Personnel and&#13;
Administration, asked of me--and my last official act--was a memorandum to&#13;
McNamara, dated March 31, 1979.        I urged him as a minimum to make a statement&#13;
that he was seriously considering the establishment of a Tribunal, while&#13;
stressing that this would have to be approved by the Executive Directors, and&#13;
that he was not sure whether they would.        If he didn't say something, I foresaw&#13;
trouble.    Well, he didn't do it, and then the Kafka Report came out, and there&#13;
was such an outcry that he â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     That was on salaries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     That was on salaries and on tax reimbursement.     McNamara suddenly&#13;
caved in, and the Tribunal was established not too long afterwards.        But he had&#13;
held off until the last minute.        I can't tell you now how many cases the&#13;
Tribunal has had, but its reports are published.        Its membership consists of&#13;
seven by and large eminent people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            For practical reasons, it would have been much better to have joined&#13;
the UN Tribunal, which was possible.        The Bank could have opted in and&#13;
determined its own conditions.       There were fears that the UN Tribunal might have&#13;
Communist members.     This struck me as a misplaced fear, because Communists don't&#13;
believe in workers' rights.        They would be likely to support management.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BROCHES]&#13;
            Another objection, equally invalid, was that the Tribunal might include&#13;
non-members of the Bank.     I was convinced that the UN, eager to get adherence&#13;
from another organization, who would also pay a little of the cost, would have&#13;
agreed to provide that the panels which sit on World Bank cases should be&#13;
composed of persons having the nationality of member countries.        The management&#13;
--I had left the Bank--wanted to avoid possible points of controversy and felt&#13;
more comfortable setting up a World Bank Administrative Tribunal.        That was&#13;
done, and it was done well, I think.        [Heribert) Golsong, who had just come as&#13;
General Counsel-designate--he was obliged to resign a short time later--was very&#13;
useful, because he came from the Council of Europe, which had an administrative&#13;
tribunal.     It was only the Washington-based institutions that were unfriendly to&#13;
administrative tribunals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I want to append a critical footnote.     At the San Francisco conference&#13;
on the UN, the question of an Administrative Tribunal was raised, and the two&#13;
countries which were the principal opponents were the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A.&#13;
In the Bank, too, the U.S. was strongly opposed to the creation of a Tribunal.&#13;

long with its Legal Department, do you have any concluding remarks that you&#13;
would like to make about the role played by the Legal Department, or about any&#13;
other matters that I perhaps should have brought up and have failed to do?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

BROCHES1     Actually, I was with the Bank thirty-three years,     There were two&#13;
years between Bretton Woods and my joining the staff and five years since my&#13;
retirement, and that adds up to forty years.        I feel that I've been there all&#13;
that time,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Well, I would say, by and large, the Legal Department has had a&#13;
worthwhile role to play, and it has played it, by and large, well,        For the&#13;
persons who have worked there, including myself at various levels, it has been&#13;
particularly rewarding, because while the primary responsibility of the Legal&#13;
Department is limited to legal matters, it inevitably gets involved with the&#13;
problems of its clients, which may be problems of general policy, political&#13;
policy, and sometimes even options on economic decisions, technical problems,&#13;
procurement, and organizational matters.     Even though the lawyers have only one&#13;
client, its operations have so many facets that it's the equivalent of a legal&#13;
practice that is particularly rich in content.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank's Legal Department has never, unlike the legal department in&#13;
some national--especially U.S.--organizations, under any of its General&#13;
Counsels, sought to build a power base,     It has not tried to run other people's&#13;
business, although it has taken very strong positions on questions of financial&#13;
management.    Without wanting to describe the lawyers as starry-eyed idealists&#13;
--and I talk for all of them--we've mostly felt that our task was to help, that&#13;
we could be helpful, and that we ought to be reasonably objective.       The lawyers&#13;
have often, at all levels, acted as arbitrators, if you will, in a more general&#13;
sense of the word, between contending factions within the Bank, which is a&#13;
particularly satisfying function.     I think the Legal Department has been&#13;
respected by all Presidents, including McNamara,       He may not have liked to get&#13;
very close to it, but it didn't mean that he didn't respect it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           I don't know whether it's still so, but in my last years, I noticed&#13;
that some of the bright young people who joined on the programs side of the Bank&#13;
thought that law--including the Bank's Articles of Agreement--was irrelevant,&#13;

and constituted unnecessary constraints on their freedom of action, as did the&#13;
need to show what they had written to the Legal Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Now, of course the role of the lawyer in societies other than the&#13;
American is much less prominent, although that is changing, too.     Lawyers are&#13;
becoming more and more involved in business matters in Europe, too.      One of the&#13;
reasons why it was less so in Europe was because most senior administrators and&#13;
top management people are lawyers, that is to sayÂ·that they had legal training,&#13;
even though they never practiced law.     Study of the law instills a certain&#13;
discipline of thinking which enables the graduates, among other things, to see&#13;
where there might be a legal problem, and call in the lawyers, and equally to&#13;
take it upon themselves to do things without legal advice when they discern no&#13;
legal problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            More than twnety years ago I gave a talk to the professional staff&#13;
entitled "Lawyers in the Bank," in which I discussed the different attitudes to&#13;
law of lawyers and businessmen from different societies.     There are&#13;
representatives from many types of societies are in the Legal Department.&#13;
Taking this great variety into account, the Legal Department has been an&#13;
unusually harmonious group.     This has helped it vis-a-vis its clients, who are&#13;
less tempted to shop around for opinions based on assumptions of individual&#13;
lawyers' orientations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I should not fail to say that my work with the Bank has given me great&#13;
satisfaction.     I was early on given a high degree of responsibility and&#13;
successive Presidents have permitted me great freedom to determine priorities.&#13;
While my job, apart from personal rank, didn't change, the institution changed,&#13;
bringing with it new problems, and as a result, one's interest was kept up and&#13;
one's thinking refreshed.     That was true on the lending side, but even more so&#13;
on these other matters, such as the insurance, interpretation of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement, financial policy, relations with the UN and specialized agencies,&#13;

legal aspects of personnel policy, procurement, creation of new institutions,&#13;
investment disputes, investment insurance, in short an endless stream of&#13;

want to open up a big issue, unless you think it's one that we should deal with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:     Co-financing, very briefly, has one thing in common with supposedly&#13;
new departures, such as program loans.      It's something that's been with us from&#13;
practically the beginning, but it takes different forms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Gene Black sold notes of France and Holland, with a two year maturity,&#13;
with our guarantee, to the American Express.      That was a form of co-financing.&#13;
We increased these sales with guarantees.      Then when commercial banks became&#13;
familiar with the guaranteed paper of our borrowers, we started selling it&#13;
without recourse.     More co-financing.   Then we had borrowers who came to us,&#13;
such as Norway, Belgium and South Africa, who in our opinion were almost market-&#13;
ready--I'm now talking about 1949 to 1952--and who were told that we would make&#13;
them a loan in conjunction with a market operation.      This was also co-financing,&#13;
and structured as such.     The prospectus would refer to the Bank loan, and the&#13;
use of the market funds for the same project as was financed by the Bank loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            We did the same, but in a quite different form, with some French&#13;
borrowers.     The pipeline loan to SOPEG, with the French Government guarantee,&#13;
which was conditioned on our selling a certain percentage of the&#13;

notes representing our loan.     Similar terms were included in a loan for a&#13;
Rothschild-sponsored iron ore mine in Mauritania.     There were also portfolio&#13;
sales, and participations--sales of disbursed and undisbursed portions of&#13;
loans--whenever market interest conditions made this possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            For a while this went well, but then when interest rate differentials&#13;
became too great, that business died out, because our rates were so much below&#13;
the market rate, that even by selling the shortest maturities, we were not&#13;
attractive.     There were various considerations affecting this type of operation.&#13;
Wasn't it more expensive than borrowing, and therefore not a good way of&#13;
obtaining funds?     On the other hand, while not interesting from a financial&#13;
point fo view, these operations were useful in establishing relations between&#13;
our borrowers and commercial banks, and that might justify a sacrifice.        But the&#13;
business dried up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Then came a renewed effort toward the end of McNamara's term, but it&#13;
didn't go very far, and it still hasn't gone very far.     The latest--but that is&#13;
really far beyond my tenure--are these so-called B-loans, which are lending&#13;
operations divided in two parts.     One is a Bank loan, and the other is a loan in&#13;
which the Bank might come in, as if it weren't an international institution,&#13;
together with others, or would agree to guarantee later maturities or to lend&#13;
for late maturities if the borrower needed a longer maturity than the commercial&#13;
banks were willing to provide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Now this is a refinement--and, if it works out, would be great--of&#13;
something that we had also done in the past.    We would make a loan, sell the&#13;
earlier maturities, and hold the long ones, which is exactly the same thing.&#13;
Or, if we were involved in a parallel operation with the private lenders, we&#13;
would extend the period of grace on our loan, or adapt our curve of service&#13;
payments in order to accommodate the private lender's repayment schedule.        The&#13;
fact that we engaged in these various operations in the past does not mean that&#13;

there isn't merit in these renewed efforts and the search for new formulas, and&#13;

Bank bank is nothing short of idiotic, which unfortunately doesn't mean that it&#13;
might not come about.     It is a typical habit of institutions in difficult times&#13;
to search for miracle cures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            To get back to co-financing, I'm told that Hungary is a candidate for&#13;
the special B-loans, the special co-financing, and I think that is working.        In&#13;
other words, co-financing is now taking unconventional forms, which is an&#13;
extension and further development of what the Bank has been doing almost since&#13;
its beginnings.     It has created great interest among the commercial banks, for&#13;
understandable reasons.     And the Bank is trying to get a quid-pro-guo, in the&#13;
form of lower rates or longer maturities for its borrowers, to make it&#13;
worthwhile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ASHER:     So, you are current in your knowledge of the Bank as well as familiar&#13;
with its history.    When I was preparing myself for these interviews, I was told&#13;
repeatedly that you have total recall, and now that we've reached the end, I'm&#13;
convinced that it's true.     I thank you very, very much for an extremely&#13;
informative set of conversations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BROCHES:    Thank you.   I enjoyed it greatly.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In April and May 1984, Aron Broches was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert E. Asher. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1946 to 1980, Mr. Broches worked in the following
            areas: in the legal department as an attorney (1946-1951);
            as assistant general counsel (1951-1956), as associate
            general counsel (1956-1959), and as general counsel
            (1959-1971) of the World Bank and the International Finance
            Corporation (IFC); as vice president (1972-1979); and in the
            International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute
            (ICSID) as secretary general (1967-1980). His association
            with the World Bank dates back to the Bretton Woods
            conference in the summer of 1944. His transcript concerns
            his involvement with the World Bank from its conception,
            elaborating on the early difficulties of the World Bank with
            Poland and Czechoslovakia and highlighting his appraisal of
            colleague Eugene Meyer before his resignation as president.
            Mr. Broches also discusses how the access to information
            improved with the creation of the Operations Evaluation
            Department with its completion and evaluation reports.
