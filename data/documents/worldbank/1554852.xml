Abstract&#13;
The paper attempts to explain movements of real wages in the Philippines&#13;
in terms of the standard trade-theoretic Stolper-Samuelson-Rybczynski model.&#13;
In view of the factor intensities in the Philippines, commodities are aggre-&#13;
gated into two composite goods--traded and non-traded--whose relative price--&#13;
the so-called 'real exchange rate'--is shown to have been an important&#13;
determinant, with changes in relative factor supplies of less importance in&#13;
determining real wages. A conventional two-sector model is set out, which&#13;
distinguishes between the shoro-and long-run effects in terms of the 'quasi-&#13;
fixity' of sector specific capital. A simple regression model is estimated&#13;
and seems to provide a fairly good explanation of what has hitherto appeared&#13;
to be a puzzling feature of post-war Philippines economic performance--high&#13;
growth rates of output and employment, accompanied by declining real wages&#13;
(in turn being associated with a rising incidence of poverty) in at least&#13;
two periods. The final section of the paper briefly outlines the sources&#13;
of the movements in the real exchange rate, leading to these real wage&#13;
movements, and draws some tentative conclusions for economic policy.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
This paper attempts to explain post-war movements of real wages in&#13;
the Philippines in terms of the standard trade-theoretic Stolper-Samuelson-&#13;
Rybczynski (SSR) model. This may be of interest for three reasons.&#13;
First, despite fairly rapid growth in output and employment, there&#13;
have been two periods of marked real wage decline in the Philippines, which&#13;
have also been associated with an increasing incidence of poverty. As these&#13;
cannot be explained in terms of an unsatisfactory overall increase in the&#13;
demand for labour relative to its supply (see Lal (1980)), various&#13;
structuralist explanations have been popular (see Khan (1977)). In our&#13;
view, these, too, are flawed, as they depend upon various forms of labour&#13;
market segmentation for which there seems to be virtually no evidence in&#13;
the Philippines (see Lal (1980), Ch. II). Hence our search for an explanation&#13;
within the standard neo-classical trade-theoretic framework.&#13;
Though the SSR theorems are amongst the most thoroughly researched&#13;
in trade theory, and would seem to be directly relevant to our subject, they&#13;
have rarely been applied.-/ This may be due to their long run character, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
well as the other standard simplifying assumptions on which they are based.&#13;
Their short run versions in the so-called Ricardo-Viner (RV) model, which&#13;
assume sector specific capital stocks but mobile labour (in the three-&#13;
factor two-commodity versions (see Jones (1971), Mayer (1974), Mussa (1974)]&#13;
are known to suffer from the so-called neo-classical ambiguity [see Samuel-&#13;
son (1971), Jones (1975)] concerning movements in the short run real wage.&#13;
These, unlike the long run SSR versions, can no longer be predicted solely&#13;
from the production structure of the economy and could, moreover, be at&#13;
variance with the long run predictions. However, as Burgess (1980) has&#13;
recently shown, once inter-industry flows are introduced into the 'two&#13;
specific- one mobile factor' model, at least for certain parameter values of&#13;
the production structure, this neo-classical ambiguity disappears. It is&#13;
this version of the short-run version of SSR that we apply to the&#13;
Philippines. The dynamics of adjustment to the prices and/or factor&#13;
supplies have been studied by Mussa (1978). He shows that in an economy&#13;
with ongoing capital formation (at increasing marginal cost) and depreciation&#13;
of existing capital, the qualitative properties of the adjustment path are&#13;
the same with static or rational expectations.2/ This enables us to sidestep&#13;
the thorny issue of expectation formation and the adjustment technology in&#13;
our empirical work, and to determine the time path of real wage movements&#13;
purely in terms of standard parameters of the production side of the economy,&#13;
and the exogenous relative price and relative factor supply changes, over&#13;
time.&#13;
Thirdly, as the empirically determined commodity aggregation (dic-&#13;
tated by the relative factor intensities of commodities) for the Philippines&#13;
entails a model that only distinguishes between traded and non-traded goods,&#13;
the key relative price of these goods is also the so-called 'real exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
rate' of the Australian model of balance of payments adjustment [see Salter&#13;
(1959), Corden (1977)]. Recently there has been much concern with the&#13;
'social' consequences of various IMF short-run stabilisation programmes in&#13;
developing countries [see Nowzad (1981)]. A major component of these pro-&#13;
grammes is measures to affect the real exchange rate. Hence the analysis and&#13;
empirics of this paper which explicitly links real wage movements with those&#13;
in the real exchange rate may also be of interest in the debate on the norma-&#13;
tive question of the 'optimal' stabilisation scheme for a small open develop-&#13;
ing country whose exports are natural resource rather than labour intensive.&#13;
The paper is in three parts. The first provides the necessary&#13;
Philippine background, and the particular trade-theoretic model we use in the&#13;
second part to explain Philippines real wage movements between 1956-1978.&#13;
The third part pinpoints the sources of the real exchange rate changes which&#13;
we argue have led to the observed movements in real wages, and thus briefly&#13;
considers the issues involved in devising 'optimal' stabilisation policies&#13;
in an economy such as the Philippines.&#13;
Part I&#13;
The Setting&#13;
Table 1 summarises the data on overall trends in the labour force,&#13;
employment, constant price NNP and various measures of unemployment for the&#13;
Philippines in the post-war years. Table 2 provides data on the movements in&#13;
real wages for urban and rural labour. Elsewhere [Lal (1980)] we have studied&#13;
the available evidence of the functioning of the Philippines' labour markets.&#13;
The following conclusions from that study and the data in Tables 1 and 2 are&#13;
relevant for our purposes.&#13;

The figures till 1973 are from Tidalgo (1976). She states that these are the full time equivalent unemployment of the visibly under-&#13;
employed defined as below 40 hours and wanting additional work. However, from the November 1973 Labor Force Survey (NCSO Bulletin No. 40 T&#13;
the total number of workers working under 40 hours and wanting additional work was only 900 thousand, which is less than the 1200 thousand&#13;
'fully unemployment" equivalent of these workers reported by Tidalgo in 1973 (column 7). Rovever, there were altogether (858,000 vorking&#13;
less than 20 hours and 2,541,000 working less than 39 hours - 3399 thousand workers (including those not wanting additional work) working&#13;
less than 40 hours (NCSO Bulletin No. 20 Table 12). If it is assumed that the average hours worked was 10 for those under 20, and 30 for&#13;
those between 20 and 39 hours, we get the full time unemployment equivalent in thousands as: (3/4 (858) + 1/4 (2,541) - 1,278, which is&#13;
close to Tidalgo's figure. We therefore deduce that Tidalgo's estimates refer to those working less than 40 hours (including those not&#13;
wanting additional work), and hence are a rough measure of the surplus labor time (below a 'full time' employment norm of 40 hours)&#13;
available in the employed labor force.  Our estimatea for 1974 onwards therefore are based on this above assumption.&#13;
Unemployed (openly) plus the full time equivalent unemployment of the visibly underemployed, defined as those persons working less than 40&#13;
hours a week.&#13;
These figures have been computed in Statistical Appendix Table A.1, from the NCSO data, for those working less than 40 hours and wanting&#13;
additional work, and they correspond more closely to a notion of involuntary underemployment, on the assumption that implicitly those&#13;
wanting additional work, would be willing to work up to 40 hours at their current wages.&#13;
Interpolated values by averaging the figures of the previous and the folloving year with October and May surveys.&#13;
e/ Interpolated values by conputing the average annual growth rate of 1968-71.&#13;
The labor force definition for these years is different, it is for the population 15 years and older, as compared vith 10 years and above&#13;
for earlier years.&#13;
See note a above for the basis of computing these figures.&#13;
Note:&#13;
The NCSO labor force surveys vere conducted biannually in May and October till 1968 (except for 1958, 1960, 1962 and l164). A May&#13;
survey. was undertaken in 1969 but none in 1970 when the Census of Populstion and Housing was conducted. From 1971 a quarterly survey in&#13;
February, May, August and November was instituted, except that the first quarterly survey in 1971 was in March. The sample design of the&#13;
survey was changed in 1965 and again in 1971.&#13;
The employment and labor force data from Tidalgo (1976) shown are averages of the May and October figures from 1956 to 1968, and&#13;
quarterly averages from 1971 to 1973. 'For the years when only one or no labor force survey undertaken, the average of the preceding and&#13;
the following year when surveys were undertaken is used instead' (Tidalgo, Ibid, p. 184).&#13;

a/ This series was estimated by the ILO Sharing in Development team, and is reported in Berry (1978). It uses data&#13;
from. BAECON wage surveys, or made available directly by BAECON. Deflation was by the consumer price index for&#13;
areas outside Manila.&#13;
b/ Estimated by Berry (1978) from BAECON data.&#13;
Hicks &amp; McNicoll (1977), estimates were derived by weighting the money wages for four categories of farm workers&#13;
(plowmen, planters, harvesters and common laborers) in nine geographical regions, by the numbers of workers in&#13;
each category.  It also makes adjustments for payment in kind in the form of two meals per day for each worker.&#13;
The deflator used was the consumer price index for regions outside Manila (available since 1957) spltced to the&#13;
Manila price index for domestic consumer goods for the 1950-57 period (see Hicks-McNicoll, p. 91).&#13;
d This is reported in Khan (1977).&#13;
e Series A, is the unweighted average of BAECON wages rates for ploughman, planters and harvesters (for which&#13;
alone data was available) till 1966, and from 1966 to 1973 onwards also includes the unweighted average of wage&#13;
rates of cultivators, weeders and sprayers. For 1973 and 74, the daily cash earnings of salary and wage earners&#13;
in agriculture for NCSO, Survey of Household Bulletin Labor Force, May Series, have been spliced in.&#13;
f   This is also from Khan (1977), and is the unweighted average of BAECON wage data for ploughman, harvesters and&#13;
planters only.&#13;
I! This is also from Khan (1977) and is the wage rate for ploughmen only.&#13;
h These are our estimates from Table A-10.&#13;
i   These are our estimates of the unweighted average of BAECON wage rates of the same groups as in (d) above, but&#13;
without any adjustment for payments in kind for meals.  As in (d) above after 1966, the average is across wage&#13;
rates of cultivators, weeders and sprayers, in addition to ploughmen, planters and harvesters for all regions.&#13;
The deflator is the consumer price index for areas outside Manila from 1957, to which the Manila consumer price&#13;
index is spliced for earlier years.&#13;
/ This is our estimate of daily cash earnings from the NCSO Labor force surveys.&#13;

First, purely in terms of the growth of employment relative to in-&#13;
creases in labour supply (and noting some decrease in unemployment and under-&#13;
employment) job creation has kept up with increases in labour supply. Nor has&#13;
this been at the expense of any dilution in the 'quality' of jobs as judged&#13;
by such indices as (a) the changes in average hours worked, (b) changes in&#13;
the numbers (or percentage) of those who want additional work, and (c) changes&#13;
in the distribution of employment by broad class of worker--salary and wage&#13;
earners, self-employed and unpaid family workers. Neither is there any evi-&#13;
dence of any 'discouraged worker' effect which might have meant a larger&#13;
'ex ante' labour supply than needed to meet the increases in labour demand&#13;
[see Lal (1980), Ch. 1].&#13;
Second, Philippines labour markets have functioned fairly&#13;
efficiently, and would seem to be closer to the competitive view of their&#13;
likely behaviour than the opposing structuralist view which emphasises labour&#13;
market segmentation. There is no evidence of trade union activity raising the&#13;
price of organised sector labour above its supply price to any marked extent,&#13;
while there is survey evidence to support the view that there are virtually&#13;
no social barriers to entry into different labour markets in the Philippines.&#13;
There is considerable inter- and intra-generational occupational and geo-&#13;
graphical mobility [see Castillo (1977), ILO (1974), Abrientos (1972),&#13;
Castillo (1975)]. There is also considerable intrasectoral mobility of labour&#13;
within the rural sector, with multiple farm and non-farm occupations common&#13;
amongst rural households. As such, at least for the unskilled, we would&#13;
expect rural labour markets to be fairly well integrated. Similarly, for the&#13;
so-called urban informal sector, survey results show considerable occupational&#13;
mobility [see Tidalgo and Jurado (1978)]. Nor is there any evidence of any&#13;
obvious barriers to entry into the urban 'formal' or the rural 'plantation'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sectors [see Lal (1980), Ch. II]. Hence, overall increases in labour demand&#13;
can be expected to be diffused relatively rapidly over the various industrial,&#13;
occupational and regional labour markets in the Philippines.&#13;
Despite the above factors, there is considerable evidence of a de-&#13;
cline in real wages between 1961-64 and again from 1969-74 for most groups in&#13;
the economy, though any secular tendency for real wages to decline is statis-&#13;
tically more speculative [see Khan (1977), Berry (1978), Lal (1980)].&#13;
Finally, there is some evidence of a falling wage share and output&#13;
capital ratio and rising capital intensity over the last two decades [see Lal&#13;
(1980) for a summary of the evidence which is largely confined to the manu-&#13;
facturing sector]. Williamson (1971) has estimated an elasticity of substi-&#13;
tution between capital and labour for Philippines manufacturing of about 0.9.&#13;
If this applied to the economy as a whole, the above stylised facts would&#13;
imply that there has been, in growth accounting terms, capital using technical&#13;
progress strongly biased against labour in the Philippines. 3/ But, while&#13;
suggestive, this does not in itself provide any explanation of the observed&#13;
real wage movements. First, because it raises the further question of the&#13;
causes of this form of biased technical progress in the Philippines. Second,&#13;
and more importantly, some explanation is needed as to why this bias should&#13;
have been particularly great during the two periods of marked real wage&#13;
decline.&#13;
It is in this context that we seek to explain the movements in real&#13;
wages in terms of a more basic economic mechanism, viz. relative price move-&#13;
ments in a fairly aggregated economy wide model. The principle we follow in&#13;
our aggregation follows from the long run SS result that ceteris paribus, the&#13;
real wage would be expected to be inversely (directly) correlated with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
decreases (increases) in the relative price of the most labour intensive&#13;
'commodity' in the economy.&#13;
We distinguish three different sectors: those producing (i) im-&#13;
portable, (ii) exportable, and (iii) non-traded commodities. Broadly, in the&#13;
Philippines, these can be identified with (i) manufacturing (which is still&#13;
mainly import-substituting); (ii) the cash crops, mining and other natural re-&#13;
source intensive export activities (manufactured exports being a relatively&#13;
minor part of this 'sector') and (iii) the rest, which comprise services, non-&#13;
cash crop agriculture, and the production of various commodities for local/&#13;
domestic consumption. From the fragmentary data on factor intensities that&#13;
can be pieced together [from Bautista (1975), Power and Sicat (1971), Hicks&#13;
and McNicoll (1971), and Table 3 below] it appears that non-traded commodities&#13;
are the most labour intensive in the Philippines. Though given the abundance&#13;
of unskilled and semi-skilled labour in the economy, exportables may have been&#13;
expected to be the most labour-intensive, in fact they appear to be land and&#13;
natural resource intensive. If following Kenen (1965) we assume that land and&#13;
natural resources require complementary inputs of capital to be made&#13;
'effective', we can 'lump together' both the traded goods as being capital in-&#13;
tensive relative to the non-traded good. Moreover, to the extent that the&#13;
domestic prices of traded goods are influenced by their respective world&#13;
prices and the exchange rate, the domestic relative price of exportables and&#13;
importables will be constant if the terms of trade are constant, and the&#13;
tariff equivalent structure and level of trade restrictions remain unchanged.&#13;
Though neither of these last two assumptions is strictly valid for the&#13;
Philippines, we shall, however, be making it in order to allow us to treat&#13;
traded goods as a Hicksian composite good.4/&#13;

Source:  This table has been derived from the 12-sector transactions&#13;
table for 1969 for the Philippines given in Table 16.1 of the Philippine&#13;
Statistical Yearbook 1978 (NEDA, Manila, 1978), as follows. Sectors 1-&#13;
Agriculture, 2-Fisheries, 5-Food Manuf., 7-Construction, R-Utilities,&#13;
9-Transportation, 10-Trade, 11-Building, Insurance and Real Estate, and&#13;
12-Other Services, in the 12-sector table were aggregated as non-traded.&#13;
The remaining sectors--3-Forestry and Logging, 4-Mining and Quarrying,&#13;
6-Other Manufactures, were treated as traded. The item under depreciation&#13;
in the original table was treated as part of the rental, and the other&#13;
item in value added-other value added, which includes both the wage and&#13;
capital earnings of the self-employed, was broken down into its wage and&#13;
capital components using the methods detailed in Lal (1978), p. 101.&#13;
(B) The above table yields the following values of the production parameters&#13;
defined in the text:&#13;

aKT a 0.5052; aKN = 0.3505&#13;
In Lal (1978), short and long run demand elasticities for labour with respect&#13;
to the wage rate have been estimated. Using the estimates for large scale&#13;
manufacturing for traded and traditional services for non-traded goods, gives&#13;
the following short run elasticities: (see Lal (1978), Table 53, p. 147).&#13;
=T 0.3;    tN - 0.5-&#13;
Finally, from the Statistical Yearbook, 1978, op. cit., (p. 46), 34.1% of&#13;
total employment was in agriculture, forestry and fishing.   From the 1969&#13;
input-output table, 7% of the wage bill for this sector was for forestry&#13;
and fishing.  Assuming that employment was also distributed in this&#13;
proporti6n yields 2.39% of the labour force in forestry and fishing.    Similarly,&#13;
whilst other manufacturing in the total manufacturing wage bill was 75%, which&#13;
,yields share of other manufacturing in total employment of 12.98%. The&#13;
total share of traded good employment is thus 2.39 + 12.98 - 15.4%. Hence,&#13;

The Model&#13;
Consider the two-good, two-factor model in which capital (K) is&#13;
immobile between the two sectors--traded (T) and non-traded (NT)--in the short&#13;
run, but mobile in the long run. Labour (L) is mobile in both the short and&#13;
long run. Unlike the models of Jones (1971), Mayer (1974), and Mussa (1974),&#13;
there are intermediate goods flows from both industries, which (unlike&#13;
Burgess (1980)) also include inputs of each good in its own production. The&#13;
following equations in Jones (1965) algebra describe the unit cost and the&#13;
factor balance conditions of the resulting general-equilibrium model, where&#13;
Yn  and  Yt are the gross outputs of the non-traded and traded goods, pi is&#13;
the price of the  i    commodity, aii    is the  i    input in the production&#13;
of the  jth  commodity and  w   is the common wage rate and  r   the rental&#13;
rate in the  ith  industry.&#13;

(a) Relative Commodity Price Changes&#13;
The short run impact of relative commodity price and factor supply&#13;
changes on nominal, and thence on real, wages can be determined from (7).&#13;
First, consider a change in relative commodity prices, with a rise in the&#13;
price of traded goods, that is with   4 &gt; O , p*     0 . Then,&#13;
W* G {[X ATT(l-ITT)/vT] - AZNeNOTN/vNIPT                          (7a)&#13;
Table 3 presents estimates of the parameters in (7a) for the Philippines,&#13;
which suggest that the value of w*    is close to zero.   This suggests that the&#13;
impact effect of a rise (fall) in the relative price of traded goods in the&#13;
*    *  *&#13;
Philippines is a fall (rise) in the real wage rate (W), as W     - w -p  , in&#13;
terms of either traded or non-traded goods (noting that ex hypothesi any&#13;
relative price change can be represented by   pN   0  and  PT   &lt; 0 )&#13;
The long run equilibrium value of the nominal and real wage change&#13;
can be determined by removing the sector specific capital assumption of&#13;
the model summarised by equations (1) and (4). With capital mobile between&#13;
the sectors in the long run, the capital balance equation (2) becomes:&#13;
akTYT + akNN    K                                               (2a)&#13;
Denoting the total direct and indirect primary factor inputs in the&#13;
production of net output (Xi) of the two goods by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
AiN   (1 + alf) aiN + aiTaTN   (i-K,L)&#13;
i=K,L),&#13;
AiT = (1 + aTT)aiT + aiNaNT&#13;
the unit cost conditions in equation (1) can be rewritten in terms of total&#13;
primary factor inputs as:&#13;
AK r + ALjw = p1   (j=N,T)                                       (8)&#13;
and the factor balance constraints as:&#13;
AINXN + AtTXT   L&#13;
)                                            (9)&#13;
AWiXN + AkTXT   K&#13;
Total differentiation of (8) and (9) and solving for w will yield the long&#13;
run equilibrium changes in w , flowing from a change in the    p's , which if&#13;
we define  a,, = Aijpi/pj , and    ii - AijX /i , with  i-K,L, and  j-N,T , as&#13;
the equivalent of the earlier  O's  and   X's  in terms of the total primary&#13;
factor coefficients, and denote the long run wage change by we&#13;
W* = [a~         *.at0&#13;
e     KTPN    tKNPTJI I                                         (10)&#13;
where   lal - (acLNKT -  KNLT)&#13;
Given the values of the a's in Table 3, which obviously depend only on the&#13;
factor intensities of the two aggregate commodities, |a| is positive, which&#13;
means that any relative increase in the price of traded goods, pT &gt; 0 , N ' 0,&#13;
w    0, and vice versa for a fall in the relative price of traded goods. Thus&#13;
the change in the long run equilibrium real wage   (We). for any change in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
relative price of traded goods will be   W    w  - p   &lt; 0 , in terms of either&#13;
e    e    T&#13;
traded or non-traded goods.&#13;
Thus, we would expect that the impact effect of a rise (fall) in&#13;
the relative price of traded goods in the Philippines on the real wage would&#13;
be further accentuated, and be of the same sign; that is, it would fall (rise)&#13;
in the long run.&#13;
(b) Changes in Factor Supplies&#13;
From (7) the reaction of the nominal wage to a relative rise (fall)&#13;
in the labour supply, can be readily determined (with K = KT = 0, and&#13;
L &gt; 0) as&#13;
*     *&#13;
w  = -L /E                                                        (7b)&#13;
As E is positive, the real wage will initially fall (rise) with a relative&#13;
rise in labour supply (as ceteris paribus prices have not changed, the nominal&#13;
wage change from (7b) will also be an equivalent real wage change), but as&#13;
is evident from (10), in the long run SSR equilibrium there will be no change&#13;
in the nominal and hence real wage. Thus during the adjustment process the&#13;
initial decline (rise) flowing from an expansion (decrease) in relative labour&#13;
supply will be completely reversed.&#13;
(c) The Adjustment Process&#13;
It remains to chart the adjustment process between the impact effect&#13;
and the long run equilibrium resulting from exogenous changes in relative&#13;
commodity prices and factor supplies. These will depend upon the shifting of&#13;
capital that will ensue as a result of the divergence in rental rates on the&#13;
short run sector specific capital stocks.   These can be readily derived by&#13;
solving for  rT   and  rN  from (5) and (6).5/  Given a relative rise (fall)&#13;
in the price of traded goods,   r. &gt; 0 , and  r  &lt; 0 (r. &lt; 0; rN &gt; 0).   While&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
given a relative rise (fall) in labour supply, both rental rates will rise&#13;
(fall) but with  rN &gt; rT &gt; 0   (rT &lt; rN &lt; 0) . With depreciation of the&#13;
existing capital stock and ongoing net investment, replacements and increments&#13;
to the capital stock will be made in the sector whose relative rental has&#13;
increased (or fallen least) as a result of the relative commodity price or&#13;
relative factor supply change. The impact of the nominal wage, and the real&#13;
wage, (as ex hypothesi during the adjustment process relative prices are&#13;
constant) will then depend upon the direction and the extent of the shifting&#13;
of the capital stock, till the rental rates in the two industries are equal-&#13;
ised at their long run equilibrium value.6' To determine the wage changes&#13;
during the adjustment process (wa) assume (for simplicity) that the capital&#13;
stock adjustments take place entirely through the replacement in the sector&#13;
with the higher rental of the depreciated stock in the sector whose rental&#13;
has fallen.  In that case, say as a result of   PT &gt; 0, the increase in the&#13;
traded good sector's capital stock will be exactly equal to the loss of the&#13;
non-traded good sector's, that is, during the adjustment process dT - -d KN.&#13;
As during the adjustment process prices are constant,   p;   0.   Imposing&#13;
these conditions on equations (5) and (6) and solving for w     yields the&#13;
value of the nominal (and because prices are constant, the real) wage during&#13;
the adjustment process as:7/&#13;
a     (LN/K   LT/K*)dKN/L.E                                       (11)&#13;
As from Table 3,  LN/KN   &gt; LT/KT, nominal and real wages will fall (rise) as&#13;
capital is shifted from (to) the non-traded sector, as a result of the impact&#13;
effect of raising (lowering) the relative rental on traded goods, flowing from&#13;
the exogenous change in relative commodity prices and/or in relative factor&#13;
supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Part II&#13;
The Regression Model&#13;
From the results of the previous section it is evident that the&#13;
time path of real wages for any given exogenous change in relative commodity&#13;
prices and factor supplies will be determined by equations (7), (10) and (11).&#13;
Thus consider a simultaneous increase in the relative price of traded goods&#13;
and of labour relative to capital supply    (   &gt;0; pN - 0; L     &gt;   ;&#13;
KT - K  - 0).   Then in the first period, the real wage will fall (i) because&#13;
of the impact effect of the rise in the traded good price (from (7), and&#13;
given the likely parameter values in Table 3); (ii) because of any readjust-&#13;
ment of the capital stock from the non-traded to traded good industries&#13;
flowing from the rise in the rental on traded good capital relative to non-&#13;
traded good capital following the rise in the traded good relative price&#13;
(from (11)); (iii) the impact effect of a relative increase in labour supply&#13;
from (7). But this fall in the real wage will be (iv) counterbalanced to the&#13;
extent that the implicit rise in the rental rate on non-traded goods with a&#13;
ceteris paribus increase in labour supply, induces a reverse flow of capital&#13;
from the traded to non-traded good sector in the first period. Over time, the&#13;
real wage will continue to fall towards its long run equilibrium value due to&#13;
the rise in the traded good price (from equation (10)), as the effect (ii)&#13;
above comes to predominate. But this fall will be tempered by the effects&#13;
under (iv) above, as the initial decline in the real wage as a result of the&#13;
relative expansion in labour supply is reversed in the long run.&#13;
The speed with which this adjustment process will converge to the&#13;
new long run equilibtium will depend both upon the nature of expectations as&#13;
well as the costs of adjustment [see Mussa (1978)]. However, for an adjust-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
ment process with increasing marginal costs of investment and with ongoing&#13;
net investment and depreciation, the qualitative properties of the adjustment&#13;
path will be the same under both static and rational expectations [Mussa&#13;
(1978), Section IV], namely those summarised under the effects (i)-(iv) above.&#13;
This implies that the time path of percentage changes in real wages   (W )  in&#13;
t&#13;
the Philippines can be represented by the following reduced form equation:&#13;
*        t-z         t-q    *&#13;
W      +   i b P +     I   ck +u                                 (12)&#13;
i-t         J=t  i i &#13;
where *&#13;
P   is the percentage change in the relative price of traded to non-&#13;
traded goods;&#13;
k   is the percentage change in the overall capital-labour endowment;&#13;
a   represents any time trend;&#13;
u   is a random error term; and&#13;
z,q are the respective lengths of the lags between the impact and&#13;
equilibrium effects of any exogenous change in relative commodity&#13;
prices and relative factor supplies, respectively.&#13;
We expect negative b's and the c's to be initially positive and then negative.&#13;
The Results&#13;
Table 4 summarises the data we have used to estimate (12) for the&#13;
Philippines, and its notes explain the sources. Of the various wage series&#13;
shown in Table 2, the Central Bank's wage earners series labelled WE , and&#13;
the BAECON's agricultural wage series labelled WA are deemed to provide the&#13;
most reliable available estimates of movements in urban and rural wages&#13;
*        *&#13;
respectively.  As our  P   and  k   series are derived series, they are likely&#13;
to suffer from unknown measurement errors, which should also be kept in mind&#13;
in what follows.&#13;

As we have no a priori theory to determine the nature and length of&#13;
the lags z,q for the Philippines, statistical convenience determined our choice&#13;
of the use of the Almon polynomial lag on the two independent variables.&#13;
Various orders of the polynomials and different lag lengths were tried. The&#13;
best results were obtained with a first degree polynomial and a one period lag&#13;
on the relative price (P ) and a two period lag on the relative factor supply&#13;
(k ) variables.8- These relatively rapid rates of adjustment are not altogether&#13;
implausible. It is well known that acreage under different crops adjusts&#13;
fairly rapidly to relative crop price changes [see Behrman (1968)], and for&#13;
Philippines manufacturing, Williamson (1971a) found that one to two year lag&#13;
models provide good statistical fits for the response of relative factor in-&#13;
put changes flowing from relative factor price changes.9/&#13;
The regression results are summarised in Table 5. The results for&#13;
the WA series are 'better' than those for the WE series. For both, the p&#13;
variable has the expected sign which is not significant, but only the WA&#13;
series shows the reversal of signs that is expected, and which is also sig-&#13;
nificant, for the k    variable.  Overall it appears from these results that&#13;
the SSR model does provide an explanation for the paradoxical real wage move-&#13;
ments in the Philippines. Figure 1 charts the actual and predicted wage&#13;
movements for the two wage series.&#13;
Part III&#13;
Causes of Relative Commodity Price Changes&#13;
If the above SSR process is accepted as being operative in the&#13;
Philippines, we can disaggregate our traded commodity bundle further into its&#13;
constituent exportable and import substitute components. This will enable us&#13;
to see the different factors which, through their effects on the domestic&#13;

prices of exportables and import substitutes, have altered the real ex-&#13;
change rate and thereby led to the observed movements in real wages. This,&#13;
however, means that we need to expand our earlier two-good two-commodity&#13;
model, which we do-by including a third factor of production, land (G), which&#13;
is used in the production of non-traded goods (N) and exportables (X) but not&#13;
for import substitutes (M). The unit cost conditions in the three industries&#13;
will then be given by:&#13;
a,MW I akMr   pm&#13;
(i=X,N)                              (12)&#13;
aZiw + akir +aGi = pi&#13;
for the long run case where, for simplicity, we assume that there is no&#13;
change in factor supplies. Further, we assume that the factor intensities&#13;
in the three industries are as follows:&#13;
akX/akX I akM/akM &gt; akNla ZN&#13;
aGX /a X &gt;aGN /aN   and  akN/aGM &gt; akx /aGX&#13;
that is importables are intensive in the use of capital, exportables in the&#13;
use of land and non-traded goods in the use of labour relative to the other&#13;
commodities. Then, total differentiation of (12) and using our previous&#13;
*&#13;
notation allows us to solve for w     , as&#13;
w* = loll/ 1e1&#13;

Therefore, we would expect that,ceteris paribus,real wages would vary inversely&#13;
with changes in the domestic prices of exportables and importables, and&#13;
directly with that of non-traded goods.&#13;
Domestic prices of importables and exportables can rise relative to&#13;
those of non-traded goods if, ceteris paribus, their foreign currency prices&#13;
rise, or the exchange rate depreciates, or the level of tariffs and/or export&#13;
subsidies (implicit and explicit) increases. Table 6 summarises the data on&#13;
exchange rates, and the foreign and domestic currency prices of importables and&#13;
exportables. From these we can deduce which of these factors were&#13;
responsible for altering the real exchange rate during the 1956-1978 period.&#13;
Figure 2(A) charts the ratios of the domestic to foreign currency price&#13;
ratios of importables and their foreign currency prices, (p d/p) while&#13;
m m&#13;
Figure 2(B) does the same for exportables,     (pd pf).  Both charts also show&#13;
the exchange rate (e).&#13;

Till 1961 there was a mild rising trend in the foreign prices of&#13;
importables and no clear trend in that of exportables. On the other hand,&#13;
during this period, which was one of import-substitution [see Power and&#13;
Sicat (1971), Baldwin (1975)], the domestic price of importables rose&#13;
faster than their foreign prices, and as the exchange rate was constant&#13;
during the period, this relative rise in domestic importable prices&#13;
clearly reflects the high and rising levels of protection offered in the&#13;
domestic market.&#13;
Between 1961 and 1962-63, the relative domestic to foreign&#13;
currency prices of both importables and exportables rose because of the&#13;
1960-61 devaluation of the peso. There then followed a period in which&#13;
there were mild rises in foreign currency prices and exchange rate&#13;
stability between 1961-68. The marginal decline in the relative domestic&#13;
to foreign currency price of importables during this period reflects the&#13;
limited import liberalisation that took place.&#13;
The third period between 1969 and 1972 saw the relative domestic&#13;
to foreign currency prices rising sharply because of the large devaluation&#13;
that took place in 1969.&#13;
Between 1972 and 1974 the domestic prices of both importables and&#13;
exportables rose steeply (though not as fast as their foreign currency&#13;
prices). Between 1974 and 1976 domestic prices of the two tradeables rose&#13;
faster than their corresponding foreign prices, largely because of the&#13;
devaluations of 1974 to 1976.&#13;
During 1976 to 1978 there was some fall in the   Pd/pm  ratio,&#13;
implying some marginal import liberalization, but by contrast there were&#13;
conflicting trends in the exportable sector, with no clear conclusions to&#13;

It is apparent, therefore, that it is the trade policy and&#13;
associated exchange rate policies in the Philippines which have been the&#13;
major determinant of the relative commodity price changes which have led to&#13;
the declining real wage trends that have been observed.&#13;
The distortions created by the import control regime in the&#13;
Philippines are well known and have been analyzed in detail by Power and&#13;
Sicat (1971), Baldwin (1975) and ILO (1974). They have imparted an ex-&#13;
cessive capital intensity into Philippines manufacturing and they have&#13;
been biased against the growth of labor intensive manufactured exports,&#13;
which have not grown sufficiently as a result to enable the diversification&#13;
of exports required to prevent the declining terms of trade the Philippines&#13;
has suffered in the past. As the above account suggests, their intensifi-&#13;
cation in the pre-1960. period led to the real wage decline observed in that&#13;
period, while their relative reduction in the mid-60s was associated with&#13;
the relative real wage stability during this period. Up to 1980 there was&#13;
no marked change in the degree of protection provided by the Philippines&#13;
trade control system. Ceteris paribus the real wage trends in the late 60s&#13;
and 70s cannot be explained in terms of any intensification of these trade&#13;
controls. We need to introduce macroeconomic policies and exchange rate&#13;
policy explicitly to account for these changes.&#13;
Macroeconomic Policy, Exchange Rates and Real Wages&#13;
In our theoretical model of Part II we had implicitly assumed that&#13;
money wages are flexible. But if this is so, then devaluation is redundant,&#13;
except (as on the monetarist view of the effects of a devaluation) as an&#13;
indirect way to contract real cash balances in the economy [see Johnson and&#13;
Frenkel (1976), Corden (1977), Lal (1980a)]. We thus need to trace the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
effeets of devaluation on real wage movements on alternative assumptions&#13;
about money wage flexibility, and within the SSRY.VR framework.&#13;
From Figure 2 it is apparent that there have been 3 devaluations in&#13;
the Philippines, one in 1961-62, another much larger one between 1969 and&#13;
1972 and a smaller one between 1974 and 1976. All three devaluations were&#13;
in response to emerging or extant balance of payments deficits. In addition&#13;
there was an effective devaluation in 1973-74, as the foreign currency&#13;
prices of traded goods rose, at a constant exchange rate.&#13;
The effects of macroeconomic and exchange rate changes on real&#13;
wages can be readily derived by expanding our SSR-RV two-good model of&#13;
Part II te include money, as another 'good', on well-known lines [see&#13;
Dornbusch (1973, 1974, 1980), Krueger (1974)]. We assume that nominal&#13;
aggregate expenditure is a function of the nominal money stock.A/ The&#13;
demand for our two-composite goods (Di), which we assume are gross substi-&#13;
tutes, is then given by:&#13;
Di ' DiCPT* PN' M)     (i-T,N)                                   (14)&#13;
The commodity balance equations are given by:&#13;
B-YT - DT ; Yx - %      ' ° ;                                    (15)&#13;
where B is the balance of trade, and the domestic market for the non-&#13;
traded good must always be in balance.&#13;
Totally differentiating (15), and substituting for dDi and dYi from&#13;
the total differentials of (14) and (2), yields:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

where         (6Di/6pj)pj/Di , (i,j=T,N)    are the demand elasticities with&#13;
respect to the two prices, and    im    (SDi/6M)M/D, (i-T,N)   are the  ex-&#13;
penditure elasticities for the two goods.ll/&#13;
With fixed foreign exchange currency prices, changes in the price&#13;
of traded goods   (p*T)  will depend upon exchange rate changes, but the price&#13;
of non-traded goods will be endogenously determined. The changes in real wages&#13;
will in turn depend upon the changes in money wages induced by the relative&#13;
price changes. It is known that, in the SSR-RV model the impact effect of&#13;
a devaluation (that is with    Ki   0 0)  on the non-traded good nominal and&#13;
relative price differs with the extent of moneywage flexibility in the econ&#13;
economy [see Dornbusch (1974), Jones and Corden (1976)].&#13;
With money wage flexibility the impact effect of a change in&#13;
the policy parameters, the exchange rate (and bence     PT' and the money stock&#13;
CM), on the nominal price of non-traded goods, can be obtained by substi-&#13;
tuting the values of   rN   and  w  , from (7) and footnote 5, in (17). With&#13;
Ki   0, and considering for simplicity the case without intermediate goods,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
Thts with money wages flexible, a ceteris paribus increase in the&#13;
money supply or in the price of traded goods raises the price of non-traded&#13;
goods, though less than proportionately. Whereas the rise in non-traded&#13;
good prices, from a ceteris paribus increase in money supply, will raise&#13;
the real wage (for the reasons stated in Part II, when   p  &gt; 0, p  - 0), a&#13;
devaluation will, by raising the relative price of traded goods, lower it.&#13;
By contrast, with money wage rigidity, while a ceteris paribus in-&#13;
crease in the money supply will still raise the nominal and relative price&#13;
of non-traded goods, real wages will fall, as money wages are rigid. From&#13;
Table 2 it appears, however, implausible that money wages are inflexible&#13;
in an upward direction. If they are only inflexible downwards, then as in&#13;
the case with full money wage flexibility, money and real wages will rise&#13;
with the nominal and relative price of nontraded goods, following the&#13;
monetary expansion. If the ensuing trade deficit is sought to be corrected&#13;
by a devaluation, the price of non-traded goods will fall, as in our SSR-&#13;
*&#13;
RV model, with  w =0, and fixed factor supplies, from (7), the required&#13;
* O)13/&#13;
change in the non-traded good price is readily derived as (for M G0),&#13;
Pi'  (-nT/nN)PT G [1 - l/nN]PT&#13;
or   1p*   P*N   P*/n                                                (19)&#13;
T     N     T    N&#13;
and hence for an equivalent devaluation, the relative price of non-traded&#13;
goods will fall by more if money wages are rigid rather than flexible.&#13;
But with the fall in the price of non-traded goods, and constant money&#13;
wages, real wages will rise in terms of non-traded and fall in terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
traded goods, the net effect being determined by the share of the two&#13;
types of goods in wage earners consumption.&#13;
Given these divergent predictions of the changes in the non-traded&#13;
good price with a devaluation in the short-run SSR-VR model, we can provide&#13;
a simple test of the validity of the two alternative money wage flexibility&#13;
assumptions for the Philippines. If we run an OLS regression of the form:&#13;
PN ' aO I alPT + a2M&#13;
we would expect   a   to be positive if money wages are flexible, and&#13;
negative if they are rigid (at least downwards).   Both  al  and  a2  are&#13;
expected to be less than unity, from (18) and (19), in both cases. Table 7&#13;
summarises the data on the three variables, and gives the regression results.&#13;
The rigid money wage hypothesis would seem to be convincingly refuted.&#13;
Given this we can now interpret the effects of macroeconomic and&#13;
exchange rate policies in the Philippines during the late 1960s and 1970s&#13;
on the real exchange rate and thence on real wages. For this purpose it&#13;
is useful [following Dornbusch (1980)] to derive the locus of the internal&#13;
(NN) and external (TT) balance locuses in pN and M space, as in Figure 3.&#13;
From (18) for a given exchange rate   (pT - 0) we have, for internal balance&#13;
that&#13;
PN m *MM4&#13;
so the NN locus has a positive slope of less than unity. While for external&#13;
balance from (16) after substituting the value of w     and  rT  from (7)&#13;
and footnote 5, we have:&#13;

From (14) and (15) an equiproportionate change in nominal prices&#13;

The 1969 devaluation in the Philippines was the result of an&#13;
increase in domestic absorption caused by an expansionary monetary and&#13;
fiscal policy.   The resulting outcome can be depicted on Figure 3&#13;
by an initial rise in the money supply to M' , so that the economy moved&#13;
from the initial equilibrium point  A   to the point  A1  on the  NN  locus,&#13;
where internal balance was attained by a rise in the nominal (and relative)&#13;
price of non-traded goods, but there was a balance of payments deficit. In the&#13;
absence of any sterilisation of the induced changes on the domestic money&#13;
supply of this payments deficit, the money stock would have contracted over&#13;
time,L3-/ in the face of a neutral policy stance, and the economy would have&#13;
moved back along the NN schedule to the original equilibrium point A , and&#13;
thus the original nominal and relative price of non-traded goods. In this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
process, the real wage would first have risen, and then fallen back to its&#13;
original level. The economy would have temporarily absorbed more goods and&#13;
services than it produced, by generating a trade deficit, financed by&#13;
running down reserves; or in short it would have converted some of its&#13;
foreign assets into current absorption, which would be reflected in a&#13;
temporary rise in the real wage.&#13;
The same result could be achieved, but with a permanently higher&#13;
price level, if there were a devaluation of the requisite amount to shift&#13;
the TT and NN schedules to intersect at A2. It appears, however, that&#13;
the devaluation in the Philippines in 1969 was larger so that instead of&#13;
the initial trade deficit being merely eliminated (as it would be with a&#13;
devaluation which restored equilibrium at A2), a temporary payments surplus&#13;
was generated. This suggests that the 1969 devaluation shifted the TT and&#13;
NN loci to T'T' and N'N', and the economy thus moved from A1 to A3, where&#13;
the non-traded good price rose less than proportionately than that of traded&#13;
commodities. Real wages would fall by more than required to attain the&#13;
original real equilibrium at A, or the identical one at A* towards which the&#13;
economy would then have moved, along the N'N' locus, as the payments surplus&#13;
increased the domestic money supply, and the nominal and relative price of&#13;
non-traded goods rose to the level given by A*.&#13;
The 1969 devaluation thus entailed a larger fall in real wages than&#13;
required to achieve the new equilibrium corresponding to the higher money&#13;
supply, M1. Before real wages (and the relative price of traded to non-&#13;
traded goods) could rise back from this temporarily depressed level, there&#13;
was a further effective devaluation (as a result of the rise in foreign&#13;
currency prices of all traded goods, and a constant exchange rate) in 1972-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
74 (with roughly no marked change in monetary aggregates at least till&#13;
1973--see Table 8).  This meant that the NN and TT loci shifted to N"N" and&#13;
T"T", with the economy at A4, there was another fall in the price of non-&#13;
traded relative to traded goods, and hence real wages (compared with the&#13;
position at A3 and, of course, than that at A and A*), and a large trade&#13;
surplus. In time, assuming no further exogenous shocks, the economy should&#13;
be expected to move along the N"N" locus from A4 to A**, with relative&#13;
non-traded good prices and real wages rising back to their original levels,&#13;
at A.&#13;
If this argument is correct, the appropriate cure for the 1969&#13;
deficit would have been a monetary deflation, unless the government was in&#13;
effect seeking to convert part of its foreign assets into domestic&#13;
absorption, in which case a neutral policy stance would have been&#13;
appropriate. While if the contraction of real cash balances was sought to&#13;
be effected through a devaluation, the extent of the devaluation was&#13;
possibly too large. By contrast, in the 1972-74 period, an exchange rate&#13;
appreciation would have prevented the effective devaluation that took place.&#13;
In both cases this would have prevented what appears to be excessive real&#13;
wage declines. In both cases, a freely floating exchange rate, which auto-&#13;
matically ensured external balance, would have meant that the NN and TT&#13;
loci would have shifted automatically to a point of intersection on the 450&#13;
line above the chosen (and    changing) money supply of Figure 2, and hence&#13;
the 'disequilibrium' real wage effects would have been avoided.&#13;
We conclude, therefore, that the real wage trends that are a&#13;
legitimate cause of concern in the Philippines are the result, in the more&#13;
distant past, of the capital intensive bias imparted by trade controls, but&#13;

6. The long run equilibrium value of r is given by:&#13;
r* - [aLNp       -  LTPN] /   [aKT - aKN]&#13;
7. The relevant equations determining the value of w* are:&#13;
a&#13;
L w    +    Kir*   =  0   (i =N, T)&#13;
Li*a        ila     &#13;

8.  That is,   b1=% + a1.i    (i=0,1)&#13;
cj=yo + y1.j   (j=0,1,2).&#13;
9.  Further support for this relatively rapid rate of adjustment can be&#13;
provided by the following argument. Suppose that the total capital&#13;
stock (K) is growing at the rate g, and that the rate of depreciation&#13;
on both types of capital (KT,KN) is d.    Then if the initial distribution&#13;
of the two types of capital       stock is&#13;
0     0  0   0        0    0     0&#13;
KT/K, KN/K    , with  K     + KN = K&#13;
the traded good capital stock, at the new equilibrium following a rise&#13;
in PT/PN , is 4t/Kt . Assuming that in the time, t, it takes to reach&#13;
the new equilibrium, all new additions to the capital stock through&#13;
gross investment are in the traded good sector, it follows that:&#13;
4t/Kt= K    +   I  (gKn + d.K) / K    +   I   gKn&#13;
nl                       n=0&#13;
K (l-d)t&#13;
K   (l+g)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
From the national accounts gross investment (GI) to GNP(Y) ratio was&#13;
roughly 0.2 between 1960-70. The capital-output (K/Y) ratio for the&#13;
same period (making use of our estimated capital stock figures) was&#13;
1.75. Hence the ratio of GI/K = 0.2/1.75 = 0.11. From the national&#13;
accounts the capital consumption allowance as a proportion of GNP was&#13;
about .07. If this is taken as a measure of depreciation, we have the&#13;
value of d = d.K/K    (d.K/Y)/(K/Y) = .07/1.75 = 0.04, and hence the&#13;
value of g = (GI/K) - (d.K/K) = 0.11-.04 = 0.07.   We do not have data&#13;
for the value of K%/K0 but assume that 0.4 of the capital stock was&#13;
in the less capital intensive non-traded good in the base period.&#13;
Suppose that as a result of the rise in the relative price of traded&#13;
goods, the required equilibrium capital stock in the traded good in-&#13;
dustry has to rise from its base value of 0.6 to 0.7. Then substituting&#13;
for 4 /Kt = 0.7; K/K0 = 0.4; d = 0.04; g = 0.07, in the above equation&#13;
and solving for t, we get a value of t between 2-3 years, for a fairly&#13;
large shift in capital from the non-traded to traded goods sectors to&#13;
take place.&#13;
10. In the simplest version we could assume that there is a constant money&#13;
expenditure velocity V, so that expenditure is equal to VM.&#13;
11. If following Dornbusch (1980) we assume homothetic tastes, so that the&#13;
demand functions are D = aVM/pN ; DT = (l-a)VM/pT , then in (16) and&#13;
(17) the own price elasticities of demand will be   -1, the cross price&#13;
elasticities of demand will be zero, and the expenditure elasticity&#13;
unity, so that we have the much simpler system (assuming Ki = 0)&#13;
dB = aTeLT(rT-w w) +     - M*&#13;
0 =  eLN (rN -w*) + pN - M&#13;
12.  For homothetic tastes, as 1NT=0;        a -1;    N   1, (18) reduces to:&#13;
PN =aNeLN1nT(l + aNLNnT)PT + M&#13;
13. We are assuming that the domestic money supply is\a stable function of&#13;
high powered money (H), which in turn consists of domestic credit of the&#13;
consolidated banking sector (C) and the stock of net foreign assets or&#13;
reserves (R). As a change in the balance of payments (dB) is directly&#13;
reflected in changes in R, unless there is sterilization, in the form of&#13;
a countervailing change in C, H and thence M will move in line with the&#13;
change in R, and hence dB.&#13;

            Real wages and exchange rates in the
            Philippines, 1956-78 : an application of the
            Stolper-Samuelson-Rybczynski model of trade
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The standard trade-theoretic
            Stolper-Samuelson-Rybczynski model is used in an attempt to
            explain movements of real wages in the Philippines. In view
            of the factor intensities in the Philippines, commodities
            are aggregated into two composite goods, traded and
            non-traded. The relative price, or real exchange rate, of
            these goods is shown to have been an important determinant,
            with changes in relative factor supplies of less importance
            in determining real wages. A conventional two-sector model
            is set out, which distinguishes between the short- and
            long-run effects in terms of the quasi-fixity of sector
            specific capital. A simple regression model is estimated and
            seems to provide a fairly good explanation of what has
            hitherto appeared to be a puzzling feature of post-war
            Philippines economic performance: high growth rates of
            output and employment accompanied by declining real wages,
            in turn being associated with a rising incidence of poverty,
            in at least two periods. The final section of the paper
            briefly outlines the sources of the movements in the real
            exchange rate, leading to these real wage movements, and
            draws some tentative conclusions for economic policy.
