     Do they work ?&#13;
&#13;
     Are they sustained ?&#13;
&#13;
     Do they benefit everyone,&#13;
&#13;
     including the poor in the community ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These are the questions that are now being asked for evaluating the effectiveness of infrastructure services funded by&#13;
&#13;
development assistance. As we step into the 21st century, greater accountability is being demanded of investment&#13;
&#13;
projects , for outcomes that are sustainable and more equitable than in the past decades, when the focus was&#13;
&#13;
overwhelmingly on just the construction of a targeted number of facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The water and sanitation sector is responding to the new definition of its goals by re-defining its policies and indicators&#13;
&#13;
for success in terms of sustainability and equity. In countries across the world, sector institutions, policy makers and&#13;
&#13;
investors are seeking to understand what the changes mean for them. In the perspective of this common interest and&#13;
&#13;
quest , WSP-EAP organized its 2001 annual conference for stakeholders in East Asia, on the theme "Towards sustainability&#13;
&#13;
with equity".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It has been a WSP-EAP tradition to bring together clients and partners in the region for an annual thematic event&#13;
&#13;
focused on a specific learning agenda of current interest to all. These events are unlike usual conferences. There are&#13;
&#13;
no overhead projectors, no PowerPoint presentations, no formal papers to be read and strictly no business suits.&#13;
&#13;
There is, however, intense and thoroughly enjoyable learning by individuals and groups, as borne out by evaluations&#13;
&#13;
of the events by the participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As in previous years, this conference too was designed to draw upon the participants' diverse personal experiences,&#13;
&#13;
skills and knowledge and focus them on collectively exploring the unknowns of relevance to all. Allen Hard, the&#13;
&#13;
process designer and principal facilitator, wove his special magic keeping participants engrossed in their quest. As&#13;
&#13;
this report shows, the informality generated by the process allowed people to come out of their official personae and&#13;
&#13;
engage fully in the process of pooling their knowledge, learning from each other and reaching new insights together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The conclusions and consensus we reached together with our partners will add greatly to the directions our work takes&#13;
&#13;
in the EAP region. We look forward to coming together again next year, to review progress and take the next steps&#13;
&#13;
forward.&#13;

IOVERVIEW :&#13;
 WHAT WAS THE CONFERENCE ABOUT ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Some fifty two sector professionals mainly from East Asia gathered in Chiang Mai in&#13;
&#13;
       March 2001, to collectively push the frontiers of knowledge about approaches to achieve&#13;
&#13;
       sustainable and equitable water and sanitation service (WSS) for the poor. Although&#13;
&#13;
       their focus was on East Asia, learning from across the world was drawn upon and&#13;
&#13;
       mulled over. The event aimed at furthering, in the EAP region :&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Common understanding of what is&#13;
&#13;
                                                           `sustainability' and what is `equity'in&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Water Supply and sanitation (WSS)&#13;
&#13;
                                                           projects and how they are related.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Consensus regarding how to move&#13;
&#13;
                                                           forward in ideas and actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       The event was designed to :&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Maximize learning from each others'&#13;
&#13;
                                                           experiences.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Facilitate networking for future&#13;
&#13;
                                                           collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Investigate what leads to the effective&#13;
&#13;
                                                           transfer of experience &amp; learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Essential concepts were explored and defined. Sector&#13;
&#13;
                                        trends were traced over past decades to identify where&#13;
&#13;
                                        we stood in 2001 in terms of sector knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Participants then identified what was known and still&#13;
&#13;
                                        unknown about sustainability and equity from their own&#13;
&#13;
                                        sector experience in East Asia, and globally. Country&#13;
&#13;
                                        groups rated their national sector policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
                                        in term of sustainability and equity, with some eye-&#13;
&#13;
                                        opening results. Finally, different groups worked on&#13;
&#13;
                                        integrating the twin principles of sustainability and&#13;
&#13;
                                        equity in defining how they could be operationalized&#13;
&#13;
                                        through ongoing and future water supply and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
                                        interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This report is a summary of the process and outcomes of the conference deliberations. It&#13;
&#13;
represents the voices of leading WSS practitioners and stakeholders in East Asia, making&#13;
&#13;
a strong collective statement about directions for the future, i.e. WSS investments are justified&#13;
&#13;
only if they are: a) sustainable and b) serve the poor within the society equitably. They also&#13;
&#13;
agreed that by now we do know something about how to move forward with this agenda.&#13;
&#13;
What is not yet known will have to be learned by working with local stakeholders, using&#13;
&#13;
methods that ensure participation of all interest groups. Lessons from bottom-up learning&#13;
&#13;
will have to feed upwards and continually refine sector strategies and policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The participants from 14 countries&#13;
&#13;
included a mix of government and&#13;
&#13;
ExternalSupportAgency(ESA)personnel,&#13;
&#13;
but only a few NGOs and private sector&#13;
&#13;
personnel. Health professionals and&#13;
&#13;
engineers formed the majority in the&#13;
&#13;
professionalgroupings. Thismoreorless&#13;
&#13;
reflected the current sectoral composition&#13;
&#13;
in terms of professional expertise. The&#13;
&#13;
reigning gender imbalance in the sector&#13;
&#13;
was also obviously reflected ­ there were&#13;
&#13;
11womenamongthe52participants,but&#13;

morethanhalfofthosewomenwerefrom&#13;

II        WHERE ARE WE NOW IN THE QUEST&#13;
          FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITY ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To refresh people's memories about consensus reached in past conferences and lessons&#13;
&#13;
gained from recent global research, the following definitions were offered as a starting point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   SUSTAINABILITY   = Continuous, satisfactory functioning and effective use of WSS services.&#13;
&#13;
                       (Effective use = Use by the majority in a health-promoting and environmentally sound&#13;
&#13;
                       manner)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   EQUITY           = Everyone (e.g. men &amp; women, rich &amp; poor, social minorities &amp; majority groups) has&#13;
&#13;
                       equal voice and choice in decision making, equal access to information/external inputs/&#13;
&#13;
                       benefits from projects, and shares burdens and responsibilities fairly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Participants then assessed their country situations regarding sustainability and equity in&#13;
&#13;
             WSS. The 5 following statements were placed at 5 locations around the conference&#13;
&#13;
             hall. People walked over to the statement that they agreed with. The resulting distribution&#13;
&#13;
             was like this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
How the participants voted :&#13;
&#13;
"In the country where I work most, sustainable and equitable water and sanitation&#13;

&#13;
                                                          was the large clustering of participants&#13;
&#13;
                                                          under "Don't know".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          People in the cluster explained that&#13;
&#13;
                                                          sector professionals generally have their&#13;
&#13;
                                                          personal impressions about the issue but&#13;
&#13;
                                                          there are no definite statistics or methods&#13;
&#13;
                                                          of knowing for sure whether services are&#13;
&#13;
                                                          getting better or worse for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The five stone-arch was introduced at this point as the visualization of the theme of the&#13;
&#13;
conference. It suggests that Sustainability andEquity are the principles (the pillars) that&#13;
&#13;
water and sanitation services must be founded on, in the 21st century. The arch spans&#13;
&#13;
the road to the future of the sector, in the EAP countries represented by the stars over the&#13;
&#13;
arch.&#13;

 WHAT PRIORITY QUESTIONS&#13;
 DO WE WANT ADDRESED ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Participants were asked to think of the most important questions they would like to see&#13;
&#13;

 THE HISTORY OF WSS IN EAST ASIA :&#13;
 " THE GREAT BAMBOO RAFT RIDE .......... "&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The East Asia region has seen turbulent times and wars in the past 2-3 decades, as well&#13;
&#13;
        as rapid changes due to the growth of the Asian Tiger economies in the 1980s, followed&#13;
&#13;
        by sweeping economic crisis over the past few years.&#13;
&#13;
        At the same time significant changes have taken place in the water and sanitation sector&#13;
&#13;
        globally. The 1960s saw not much happening in the sector The 1970s ushered in a focus&#13;
&#13;
        on technology , construction and expansion of coverage which spilled over to the 1980s&#13;
&#13;
        with the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD) being&#13;
&#13;
        launched in 1980. The sector attracted large investments from governments and donors&#13;
&#13;
        and universal coverage targets set by the IDWSSD were pursued globally. During the&#13;
&#13;
        1990s it became clear that supply-driven, construction ­target-oriented approaches were&#13;
&#13;
        not having the desired impact. They were leading to services being constructed but not&#13;
&#13;
        effectively used and sustained. Radical new thinking began to permeate the sector in the&#13;
&#13;
        1990s towards demand-driven approaches and community-driven development.&#13;
&#13;
        Participants worked in 8 groups to trace how these combined events and trends played&#13;
&#13;
        out in East Asia, in general and in the WSS sector specifically, over the 4 decades from the&#13;
&#13;
        1960s till 2001.&#13;
&#13;
        The decades were then given thematic titles. The entire timeline for WSS in East Asia &amp;&#13;
&#13;
        Pacific from 1960 ­ 2001 was aptly named by participants as "The Great Bamboo&#13;
&#13;
        Raft Ride Through The Last 40 Years: War, Water and People"&#13;
&#13;
        This is what the raft ride looked like.&#13;

SECTOR KNOWLEDGE MILESTONES&#13;
CROSSED IN PREVIOUS REGIONAL&#13;
CONFERENCES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      In January 1997, the Water and Sanitation Program, East Asia and Pacific (WSP-EAP)&#13;
&#13;
      organized its first regional thematic collective learning event in Da lat, Vietnam. Since&#13;
&#13;
      then 4 more learning events have been organized, some by WSP-EAP, some jointly by&#13;
&#13;
      WSP-EAP and WSP-South Asia, in Chiang Mai (January 1998), Lombok (October, 1998),&#13;
&#13;
      Bangkok (December, 1999) and the current one in Chiang Mai again, in March 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      These events brought together WSP's clients and working partners from East and South&#13;
&#13;
      Asia, to collectively analyze challenges facing WSS sector, and share experiences and&#13;
&#13;
      learning across the region to find ways of overcoming the challenges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      At the Chiang Mai 2001 conference there were some people who had participated in&#13;
&#13;
      previous events. They shared the following overview of the learning and consensus&#13;
&#13;
      achieved at the past events, which illustrate how sector thinking and knowledge has&#13;
&#13;
      been developing in the region. This helped to define the starting point for the learning&#13;
&#13;
      to be pursued in the current Chiang Mai conference in March 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      1. What are Demand and Demand Responsive Approaches (DRA) ?&#13;

&#13;
       different issues and water supply and sanitation programs need to be handled&#13;
&#13;
       differently.&#13;
&#13;
       Translating knowledge about DRA into practice requires :&#13;
&#13;
       Incorporating DRA into sector policies.&#13;

SUSTAINABILITY &amp; EQUITY :&#13;
TAKING STOCK OF OUR KNOWLEDGE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The historical timeline made it very clear that "sustainability" is a fairly recent issue&#13;
&#13;
           which has gained WSS sector attention only during the last decade of the 20th century.&#13;
&#13;
           "Equity" is newer still. None of the participants had encountered the "equity" issue in&#13;
&#13;
           any sector conference to date. There seemed much that was still unknown about the&#13;
&#13;
           two related concepts.&#13;
&#13;
           Participants divided themselves into 4 groups to ponder over three searching questions&#13;
&#13;
           about SUSTAINABILITY and EQUITY in WSS:&#13;
&#13;
                Just what do Sustainability and Equity mean in WSS ?&#13;
&#13;
                What do we now know about increasing Sustainability and Equity, in the&#13;
&#13;
                21st century (the "knowns") ?&#13;
&#13;
                What do we most need to know to enhance sustainability and equity in&#13;
&#13;
                WSS (the "unknowns") ?&#13;
&#13;
           Each group presented its conclusions and lively debates ensued, generating insights for&#13;
&#13;
           all. The emerging conclusions looked like this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  What is SUSTAINABILITY of WSS services ?&#13;
&#13;
     Continuous, satisfactory functioning and effective use of WSS services by the&#13;
&#13;
     majority.&#13;
&#13;
     Unsustainability is relatively easy to identify (after the system fails)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   What do we now know about SUSTAINABILITY ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        SUSTAINABILITY is multi-dimensional.&#13;
&#13;
        It has Social, Technical, Financial, Institutional and Environmental components. They&#13;
&#13;
        are all interrelated, making sustainability a complex issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Components of SUSTAINABILITY can be measured.&#13;
&#13;
        We do have some indicators for the building blocks of SUSTAINABILITY, and methods&#13;
&#13;
        to assess them. For example :&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Social Sustainability                How well do different users groups appreciate or value&#13;
&#13;
                                             the services/system ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Is the system supported by informed social consensus ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Extent of community ownership from the beginning ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Technical Sustainability             How appropriate and acceptable is the&#13;
&#13;
        indicators                           technology for the users ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Is it supportable by skills available in the community&#13;
&#13;
                                             for operation and maintenance ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Institutional Sustainability         Is there an institutional structure/organization&#13;
&#13;
        indicators                           in   place to operate, manage, repair ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Does it have the necessary skills ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Is the structure supported by social consensus?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Does it represent voices of all groups of service&#13;
&#13;
                                             users ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Financial Sustainability             Are operation and maintenance costs covered&#13;
&#13;
        indicators                           by user payments ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Are repair &amp; replacement costs covered ?&#13;
&#13;
                                             Are users happy to pay for services? Satisfied with&#13;
&#13;
                                             services ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Environmental Sustainability         Does the operation of the services incorporate&#13;
&#13;
        indicators                           sound water resources and environmental&#13;
&#13;
                                             management practices ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Process of service establishment is very important to ultimate sustainability&#13;
&#13;
     e.g. :&#13;
&#13;
     -  Leadership that allows voices of all to be heard.&#13;
&#13;
     -  Community ownership from the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
     -  Community choice in key decisions.&#13;
&#13;
     -  Community capacity building to manage and maintain services.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
What do we now know about EQUITY ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Current sector practices are not equity-promoting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 - Current practices do not lead to very equitable outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY is not considered seriously in every step of project development.&#13;
&#13;
 - There is no common understanding among sector stakeholders about EQUITY.&#13;
&#13;
 - Current subsidy policies do not necessarily promote EQUITY.&#13;
&#13;
 - There are no manuals/guidelines for incorporation of EQUITY during WSS project&#13;
&#13;
   development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Achieving EQUITY in projects takes special effort&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 - Targeting poverty is very difficult !&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY does not happen naturally.&#13;
&#13;
 - Informed choice by stakeholders leads to EQUITY.&#13;
&#13;
 - It requires targeting to achieve EQUITY.&#13;
&#13;
 - Intra-community targeting is essential to ensure EQUITY. Geographic targeting of whole&#13;
&#13;
   communities does not guarantee that the poor will be reached.&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY is about democratic processes.&#13;
&#13;
 - Service providing agencies are responsible for creating an equity-generating&#13;
&#13;
   environment.&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY as a principle needs to be built into policies, laws, regulations that govern the&#13;
&#13;
   sector.&#13;
&#13;
 - Policies, laws, regulations and projects need the means to verify whether EQUITY is&#13;
&#13;
   being achieved, i.e. indicators for equity &amp; methods of measuring them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 EQUITY ­ SUSTAINABILITY relationship&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY is a part of SUSTAINABILITY. Services are considered as "sustained"&#13;
&#13;
   only when they continue to serve the majority of users with acceptable levels of&#13;
&#13;
   service.&#13;
&#13;
 - More EQUITABLE services are better SUSTAINED.&#13;
&#13;
 - EQUITY is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for SUSTAINABILITY.&#13;

The wealth of worldwide experience brought to the conference by the participants was&#13;
&#13;
creatively utilized in many ways throughout the conference process. One such way was&#13;
&#13;
the Ideas Fair on Day 2 where participants were invited to make 1 minute `info-mercial'&#13;
&#13;
promotion of best examples of what they have seen, learned, and experienced about&#13;
&#13;
sustainability and equity. After 9 such info-mercials were presented people voted for the&#13;
&#13;
ones they most wanted to hear more about.&#13;

VIII&#13;
COUNTRY ANALYSIS :&#13;
ARE CURRENT POLICIES &amp; STRATEGIES&#13;
SUPPORTIVE ENOUGH ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      National governments have policies governing various sectors and strategies to guide&#13;
&#13;
      sector progress towards policy goals. External Support Agencies have globally applicable&#13;
&#13;
      policy goals and at times well defined strategies to reach them. Facilitating technical&#13;
&#13;
      assistance agencies such as WSP also have policies and strategies to guide their work&#13;
&#13;
      across countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The conference offered an opportunity to different groups of participants to take a look&#13;
&#13;
      at their organizational or sector policies and strategies and assess how far they are&#13;
&#13;
      supportive of sustainability and equity principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Policy Assessment tools were selected from the Methodology for Participatory&#13;
&#13;
      Assessments1 (MPA) and adopted for use at the conference. The purpose was not an&#13;
&#13;
      official assessment of policies and strategies but to provide the participants an exposure&#13;
&#13;
      to this new methodology for sustainability and equity monitoring, which has been&#13;
&#13;
      developed by Water and Sanitation Program in collaboration with the IRC International&#13;
&#13;
      Water and Sanitation Center. MPA is designed for use with project communities, sector&#13;
&#13;
      agencies and policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Participants worked in country groups for this exercises, with facilitation support by a&#13;
&#13;
      WSP member trained in MPA. Donor agency personnel joined the country groups&#13;
&#13;
      when they work most. WSP members working in different countries chose to get together&#13;
&#13;
      and assess where their own organization stands in this respect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      At the conference, two selected MPA exercises were used to examine:&#13;
&#13;
      a)   The extent to which SUSTAINABILITY and EQUITY are explicitly spelt out as policy&#13;
&#13;
           goals for the national sector/organization&#13;
&#13;
      b)   The extent to which organizational/national sector strategies are present to guide&#13;
&#13;
           progress toward these policy goals, in terms of:&#13;
&#13;
           -    Community cost-sharing and management of services&#13;
&#13;
           -    Community participation in decisions&#13;
&#13;
           -    Financing strategy for the poor&#13;
&#13;
           -    Presence and definition of gender in sector interventions&#13;

                                                                          bar charts by each country group and the WSP group.&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the issues it brought to the surface. The hands-on experience&#13;
&#13;
of using an MPA tool served to illustrate the potential of the&#13;

MPA methodology for sector and institutional reform&#13;

&#13;
       PARTICIPANTS' VIEWS ON THEIR LEARNING FROM THE POLICY ASSESSMENT EXERCISE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1. CAMBODIA group&#13;
&#13;
            Sustainability is a big issue with the government now, as we move from emergency perspectives to long-&#13;
            term perspectives. It is very useful for us to be able to measure &amp; monitor progress towards sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
            Scores for explicitness of sustainability in sector policy in Cambodia are low now, but will increase soon,&#13;
            because it is being built explicitly into the sector policy now being drafted. But after that the challenge will&#13;
            be to get everyone to understand and act on it.&#13;
&#13;
            `Financing Strategy for the poor' is the most interesting one for us because 85 per cent of the population&#13;
            can be classified as poor.&#13;
&#13;
            The first experience with MPA through a sanitation policy study has been useful in Cambodia. We should&#13;
            start by building the capacity of 2-3 persons in each country, who can further develop MPA capacity locally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. INDONESIA group&#13;
&#13;
            We have Sustainability explicitly in our policy goals but developing it at the ground level is proving difficult.&#13;
&#13;
            `Equity' is a goal explicit on paper ­ but not yet so at the field-level. The middle and upper social classes still&#13;
            have dominance in everything.&#13;
&#13;
            Our financing strategy for the poor is not yet well through out, scores are low.&#13;
&#13;
            We have some definition of `gender' in water supply projects, but have not done much about gender issues in&#13;
            sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
            MPA seems to be a good self-diagnostic tool, particularly for district and province level. We have to understand&#13;
            better whether and how it can be used at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. LAO PDR group&#13;
&#13;
     Our strong points seem to be `sustainability in policy goals' and `financing strategy for the poor'.&#13;
&#13;
     We need to do better in terms of `.presence and definition of gender'.&#13;
&#13;
     MPA seems to present exciting possibilities. It is difficult to digest in 1.5 hours (at the conference) !&#13;
&#13;
     We need proper training in MPA followed by pre-testing of MPA tools to tailor them for application in&#13;
     Lao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
     MPA has to be built into the institutional system , to reap its full benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. The PHILIPPINES group&#13;
&#13;
     It is thought ­ provoking why the assessments of women and men were different, although&#13;
     they all come from the same institutions ( the Philippines team was the only one to do the MPA&#13;
     exercise in separate gender groups ).&#13;
&#13;
     Why do women give lower scores for our policies and strategies than men? This can lead to&#13;
     rich debates at community and institution levels.&#13;
&#13;
     MPA scales have to be adopted to better suit country situations. (This is an important requirement,&#13;
     which is taken care of during country level MPA training. This is one of the reasons why MPA&#13;
     should not be implemented without proper training).&#13;
&#13;
     We could not maximize this (assessment) case due to lack of country data. (This was only a&#13;
     simulation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. VIETNAM group&#13;
&#13;
     MPA is exciting.&#13;
&#13;
     Why did we score low on `gender'? Gender is not a big issue in the Vietnam WSS sector. (Male&#13;
     view. Women in the team did not agree).&#13;
&#13;
     This methodology is useful for revealing views of different types of stakeholders on the same subject.&#13;
&#13;
     Knowing how to analyze MPA scores is necessary to get its full value.&#13;
&#13;
     We would like to use MPA to analyze actual practices and results in the provinces, then come back&#13;
     and look at national policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Water and Sanitation Program group&#13;
&#13;
     Which policies were we assessing ­ WSP global or WSP-EAP ?&#13;
&#13;
     WSP's present definition of Sustainability and Equity goals seems to lag behind the latest thinking&#13;
     on these issues.&#13;
&#13;
     The scaling on subsidies needs to be reviewed (country adaptations make the scales more relevant).&#13;
&#13;
     The language in the MPA scales contains a lot of jargon ­ may be difficult to translate.&#13;
&#13;
     We realize that there is no gender policy in WSP.&#13;
&#13;
     The visibility of assessment results possible through MPA can help make policy dialogues/&#13;
     debates better focussed and constructive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               23&#13;

IX        NETWORKING FOR TIMES AHEAD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At this point in the conference the main issues and challenges had been recognized&#13;
&#13;
and examined. The participants had also become familiar with each others' interests,&#13;
&#13;
expertise and experiences. The time was ripe for making connections for future&#13;
&#13;
collaborations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Each participant made out a poster about :&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   a)   his/her area of expertise, and&#13;
&#13;
   b)   areas where s/he would welcome assistance from others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The conference hall walls were lined with these posters, each of which carried 2 envelopes&#13;
&#13;
for name cards. The participants walked around and picked up business cards from&#13;
&#13;
"GIVE" envelopes of those whom they would like to contact later for specific information&#13;
or possible collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They also dropped their own business cards into the "RECEIVE" envelopes of those to&#13;
&#13;
whom they could provide some information or technical assistance. The process made&#13;
&#13;
it possible , within half an hour, for 52 participants to provide and collect contact&#13;
&#13;
information for future networking tailored to their individual interests and skills.&#13;

 HOW TO MOVE FORWARD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Towards the end of the conference consensus was&#13;
&#13;
                                       evolving that :&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              Equity and sustainability are mutually&#13;
&#13;
                                              influencing factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              Equity is a part of sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              We     know      more     about      measuring&#13;
&#13;
                                              sustainability than we know about&#13;
&#13;
                                              measuring equity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       The logical way forward, then, seemed to be to take&#13;
&#13;
                                       each key component of sustainability (i.e. social,&#13;
&#13;
                                       technical, financial, environmental and institutional), and&#13;
&#13;
                                       identify how equity could be built into it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Participants self-selected themselves into 5 groups to work on different key components&#13;
&#13;
       of sustainability. Each group focussed on the same four questions :&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               From our understanding of equity, in what ways can equity be built into&#13;
&#13;
               this component of sustainability ?&#13;
&#13;
               What can be the indicators of equity in these cases ?&#13;
&#13;
               How can these indicators be measured or verified ?&#13;
&#13;
               What implications does&#13;
&#13;
               this have for agency and&#13;
&#13;
               project practices ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The results, presented in the five&#13;
&#13;
       following tables represent a set of&#13;
&#13;
       concrete, practical ideas and&#13;
&#13;
       actions that are possible at policy,&#13;

       institution, and community level, to&#13;

&#13;
      the flight to Sustainability and Equity in WSS -- East Asia took off on schedule from the&#13;
&#13;
      Empress Hotel, Chiang Mai, Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Passengers and crew expressed their solidarity for their common vision by wearing the&#13;
&#13;
      conference symbol across their fronts, vowing to meet and compare notes on progress&#13;
&#13;
      a year from now, in terms of the learning agenda that they had identified for the EAP&#13;
&#13;
      region (detailed in section VI of this report) .&#13;

questionnaires. A Mood Meter was set up in a corner behind a screen , where&#13;
&#13;
participants marked their satisfaction with the learning that was being achieved every&#13;
&#13;
day, using colored stickers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This is how the results looked at the end of three days ........&#13;

            The water and sanitation sector is
            responding to the new definition of its goals by re-defining
            its policies and indicators for success in terms of
            sustainability and equity. In countries across the world,
            sector institutions, policy makers, and investors are
            seeking to understand what the changes mean for them. In the
            perspective of this common interest and quest, Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP)-East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
            organized its 2001 annual conference for stakeholders in
            East Asia, on the theme 'Towards sustainability with
            equity'. This report is a summary of the process and
            outcomes of the conference deliberations. It represents the
            voices of leading Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS)
            practitioners and stakeholders in East Asia, making a strong
            collective statement about directions for the future, i.e.
            WSS investments are justified only if they are: a)
            sustainable and b) serve the poor within the society equitably.
