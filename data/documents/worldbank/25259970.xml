&amp;#12;This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, and Pap-&#13;
ua New Guinea organizations. The Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Department of Health, Water PNG, and&#13;
Eda Ranu have been key partners together with WaterAid and the Water and Sanitation Program in analyzing the sector. The&#13;
authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by the European Unionâ&#128;&#153;s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program,&#13;
World Bank Country Management Unit, Asian Development Bank, Department of Implementation and Rural Development,&#13;

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The follow-&#13;
ing World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process and&#13;
report: Isabel Blackett, Penny Dutton, U-Primo Rodriguez, Trevor Nott, and Almud Weitz; as well as the following WaterAid&#13;
staff: Rick Steele and James Wicken. Charles Feinstein, Sector Manager, Energy and Water, East Asia and Pacific Region,&#13;
World Bank, and Laura Bailey, Country Manager, Papua New Guinea, World Bank, peer reviewed this report.&#13;
&#13;
The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WaÂ­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-&#13;
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conductÂ­ ed in&#13;
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to asÂ­       sess the ad-&#13;
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service deÂ­   livery pathways. SDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure&#13;
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fiÂ­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated&#13;
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Global Practice, sup-&#13;
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s donors&#13;

With a backdrop of high population growth and declining         a lack of policies that clearly articulate a vision, targets, and&#13;
coverage rates, over the last two decades, the absolute         approaches for water and sanitation; unclear institutional&#13;
number of people without access to water supply and sani-       roles in the sector; and lack of budget mechanisms for al-&#13;

The benefits to PNG of increased access to water and sani-      To achieve government water supply and sanitation access&#13;

draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs con-                          indicators and is scored from 0 to 3 accordingly. The score-&#13;

past water and sanitation coverage, a costing model to                             building blocks that are inadequate, constituting a barrier to&#13;

  Government targets have a pattern similar to the MDG, albeit with a different base year (2010). In the case of water supply, the government targets for 2030&#13;
(70%) effectively cut in half the proportion of the 2010 population that did not have access to improved facilities. The 2030 government targets also imply&#13;
reducing the proportion of the population that did not have access to improved sanitation facilities in 2010 by about 46%.&#13;

  The 2030 government targets suggest a 50% reduction in the proportion of the 2010 population that did not have access to improved water sources. The&#13;
application of this formula to urban areas, where 87% of the population had access to improved facilities in 2010, led to a target of 94% in 2030.&#13;

a role in this. Originally, the National Water, Sanitation, and                  siderable effort is needed to gear up PNG training institu-&#13;

tion entity established during the drought of 1990s and re-                      throughput of trainees required.&#13;
formed during the cholera outbreaks. However, in practice,&#13;
the National Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Committee is&#13;
not yet operating as an official coordinating mechanism.&#13;
There are no WASH technical working groups operating in&#13;
PNG or other forums for coordination between stakehold-&#13;
ers.&#13;
&#13;
A critical constraint in the sector is a shortage of human&#13;
resources to deliver increased output in water and sanita-&#13;
tion. Utilities already identify urgent skill shortages, which&#13;
are holding back the sector, such as specialized engineers,&#13;
technicians, and managers. NDOH has few personnel to&#13;
assist in the implementation of any project or insufficiently&#13;
trained staff in sanitation promotion. Provincial govern-&#13;
ments and LLGs have few skills in the operation and plan-&#13;
ning of water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Current staffing in the sector is estimated to be around&#13;
1,100 people. If the MDG targets were to be met, an ad-&#13;
ditional 7,600 people would be required, including 1,190&#13;
engineers, 4,140 technical staff, 1,760 staff in management&#13;
and finance, and 520 staff in social development/hygiene&#13;
promotion.21 To meet the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2030 targets, a&#13;
lesser but still significant increase in human resources is&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
The capacity of existing training institutes in PNG is not suf-&#13;
ficient to deliver human resources in the quantities needed.&#13;
Until 2000, the Department of Works has provided water&#13;
and sanitation training courses at their training center, but&#13;
this center is now closed and mothballed. Lae Unitech&#13;
and Madang Divine Word University provide some techni-&#13;
cal training, but the throughput is not enough. A range of&#13;
training is needed, and this might be delivered through in-&#13;
ternational short courses, for example, through the Japan&#13;

       Priority actions for financing and its implementation&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Urgently increase investment in water and sanitation especially in the rural sector.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Develop an overall financing strategy for the sector.&#13;

 Investment Planning&#13;
&#13;
 A considerable challenge to financing WASH is that the                              PNG lacks information on recurrent spending for water&#13;
 sector targets are not supported by investment planning or                          and sanitation and spending in rural and urban areas. Only&#13;
 by an operational plan. The current confused institutional                          NDOH has a budget line item for recurrent spending on wa-&#13;
 framework and lack of sector leadership prevent an overall                          ter and sanitation. It is very difficult to get information for the&#13;
 investment plan from being prepared for the sector. Where-                          provinces and districts because there are no separate line&#13;
 as most public and donor finance is on budget, financing                            items for water and sanitation.23&#13;
 through NGOs and resource companies is off budget and&#13;
 not formally reported.                                                              Utilization of Budgets&#13;

 An improvement in the PNG national budget system since                              know whether the budget allocation is in fact being spent.&#13;
 2011 is that budgets now clearly indicate development                               The overall government budget is generally utilized only by&#13;
 expenditures for water and sanitation, by project. Some of                          60%, and it is likely that water and sanitation budgets are&#13;
 the projects presented can also be linked to the provincial                         not utilized fully.24 There is some information on the pro-&#13;
 budgets. A breakdown of the funding sources (as in table 5.1)                       vincial development budgets, but this accounts for a very&#13;
 is also provided in the budget. However, the development                            small proportion of the allocations. For example, the items&#13;
 budget does not differentiate between water and sanitation,                         appearing in the 2011 provincial budgets indicate a planned&#13;
 nor does it differentiate between rural and urban investments.                      spending of US$5.2 million for 2010. This is only approxi-&#13;
 Without this level of disaggregation, it is difficult to account                    mately 13% of the total allocation for water and sanitation&#13;
 for expenditure and to evaluate if the spending is being                            that appears in the national budget. District spending on&#13;
 effective at delivering services in each subsector.22                               water and sanitation is not available and difficult to track.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 22&#13;
   For the SDA analysis, the proportion allocated between water and sanitation was derived by asking those directly involved in each project to make an&#13;
 estimate.&#13;
 23&#13;
      Field visits to provinces may be required to obtain a sense of recurrent spending on WASH, as well as capital expenditure.&#13;

 One of the difficulties in assessing service delivery in PNG is                    It is possible that rural water supply systems built in the&#13;
 the limited reliable past and recent baseline data for moni-                       past have ceased working, but the extent and reasons for&#13;

   The assumption on the proportion of budget allocated to sanitation is derived using the proportion of actual expenditure on water supply and sanitation&#13;
 on the recently completed ADB PNG Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The US$11 million included in the analysis covers the project&#13;
 preparation budget (US$1 million) in 2013 and one-third of the funds for the project proper in 2014. The analysis assumes that the project will be completed&#13;
 by 2016 instead of 2015 because the project preparation period is expected to last from 6 to 9 months. Basic information on the project was drawn from&#13;
 personal communications with Stephen Blaik of the ADB.&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Papua New
            Guinea : turning finance into services for the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water and sanitation service delivery
            assessments (SDAs) are being carried out in eight countries
            in the East Asia and the Pacific region under the guidance
            of the World Bank’s water and sanitation program and local
            partners. An SDA analysis has three main components: a
            review of past water and sanitation coverage, a costing
            model to assess the adequacy of future investments, and a
            scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The SDA analysis relies on an
            intensive, facilitated consultation process, with government
            ownership and self-assessment at its core. Through the SDA
            process, an evidence based participatory analysis has been
            conducted to better understand what undermines progress in
            water supply and sanitation and what the government of Papua
            New Guinea (PNG) can do to accelerate progress. This
            analysis aims to help PNG assess its own service delivery
            pathway for turning finance into water supply and sanitation
            services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water
            supply and rural and urban sanitation. This report evaluates
            the service delivery pathway in its entirety, locating the
            bottlenecks and presenting the agreed priority actions to
            help address them.
