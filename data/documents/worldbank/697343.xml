INDIA&#13;
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
I.    CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                India, Acting by its President.&#13;
Executing  Agency:    The State of Tamil Nadu.&#13;
Amount:                  IDA Credit of SDR 181.9 million&#13;
(US$ 282.9 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:                   IDA:  Standard with 35 years maturity.&#13;
On-Lending  Terms:       Government of India would make the proceeds of the&#13;
Credit available to the State of Tamil Nadu (GOTN)&#13;
under standard arrangements for developmental&#13;
assistance to the States of India. GOI would assume&#13;
the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Project  Description: The project would be a sector investment loan,&#13;
financing an agreed state-wide program to improve the&#13;
productivity and sustainability of Tamil Nadu's&#13;
irrigation sector, to introduce multi-sectoral water&#13;
planning, to integrate farmers in irrigation&#13;
management, and to strengthen the state's&#13;
institutional and technical capability in water&#13;
development, management and planning. Project&#13;
components would be: (a) Systems Improvement and&#13;
Farmer Turnover to improve productivity through&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of the existing&#13;
irrigation systems integrated with participation of&#13;
farmers and turnover of operations and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) of improved distributaries, as well as funding&#13;
of O&amp;M, to water user associations (55% of investment&#13;
base costs); (b) Scheme Completion Investments to&#13;
complete viable investment on existing schemes for&#13;
increased availability and reliability of water (29%&#13;
of investment costs); (c) capacity building in Water&#13;
Planning. Environmental Management and Research to&#13;
introduce multi-sectoral water planning, incorporate&#13;
environmental management in all aspects of water&#13;
planning, investment and management, and to enhance&#13;
research in the water sector (8% of investment&#13;
costs); (d) Institutional Strengthening of Tamil&#13;
Nadu's Water Resources Organization (WRO) to&#13;
strengthen capabilities in all professional and&#13;
management areas (7% of investment costs); and (e)&#13;
associated Land Acauisition and Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation for project affected persons (1% of&#13;
investment costs). The above investments are&#13;
supported by recent issuance by GOTN of a State Water&#13;
Policy defining its new, broader objectives in the&#13;
water sector, an institutional reorganization to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
establish WRO as a specialist state water agency,&#13;
stepped up funding by GOTN of maintenance to full&#13;
required levels and reordering of state expenditure&#13;
priorities to emphasize maintenance and improved&#13;
productivity of existing systems rather than new&#13;
construction.&#13;
Project  benefits:       The project would enhance agricultural production on&#13;
about 0.7 million ha (50% of the state's surface&#13;
irrigated area) directly benefitting some 4 million&#13;
persons, of which 70% occupy small and marginal farms.&#13;
Irrigation would be put on a sustainable footing&#13;
through rehabilitation and modernization of the&#13;
systems linked with farmer participation and upgraded&#13;
maintenance and water management. A specialist state&#13;
water agency would be created and strengthened&#13;
including in water planning and environmental&#13;
management, with broad and long-term benefits stemming&#13;
from multi-sectoral water planning and management,&#13;
essential for Tamil Nadu's present and long-term&#13;
economic development and its sustainability. Farmer&#13;
participation and turnover would forge a private&#13;
sector role in management of infrastructure and&#13;
contain organizational features to foster&#13;
participation of women and minorities in irrigation's&#13;
management and benefits.&#13;
Project  Risks:          First, the fundamental change in water resources&#13;
management will require continued political will and&#13;
sustained effort to be successfully implemented. Key&#13;
features required (state water policy, institutional&#13;
reorganization, reordering of expenditure priorities,&#13;
staff training and all key project related decisions and&#13;
Government announcements) were established by GOTN&#13;
during project preparation. The extensive reforms&#13;
already implemented provide a strong basis for project&#13;
start-up and some confidence regarding the critically&#13;
important continuation of GOTN's commitment. Second,&#13;
the systems improvement and farmer turnover program,&#13;
while based on successful piloting, is innovatory on&#13;
this scale. The project includes special monitoring and&#13;
management features and intensive consultancy, training&#13;
and NGO assistance, and provisions for adapting the&#13;
farmer turnover component as experience is gained.&#13;
Third, aeneral imDlementation capacitv constraints of&#13;
WRO have been addressed in the project's institutional&#13;
strengthening, including special arrangements for&#13;
implementation monitoring and financial management: in&#13;
other respects, WRO has proven capability and successful&#13;
experience in undertaking the kind of physical&#13;
activities to be implemented under the project.&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
I.   WATER RESOURCES SECTOR&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.01 The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP) would assist&#13;
Tamil Nadu state to better plan, manage and develop its water resources and to&#13;
improve the productivity of the irrigation sector. The project would fulfil a&#13;
critical need. The state is water short, severely so in some areas, and has&#13;
nearly fully developed its exploitation potential. Future economic&#13;
development will depend on the best allocation of water between sectors and&#13;
efficient use by the main sectoral users, especially agriculture. Two&#13;
principal needs are catered for under the project. First, comprehensive water&#13;
planning on a river basin basis and across sectors is required. Second, for&#13;
the largest user of water - the agriculture sector - which consumes some 75%&#13;
of water, irrigation's productivity must be enhanced to improve agricultural&#13;
growth while still ensuring the growing water needs of municipalities,&#13;
industry and other uses.&#13;
1.02 Under the project, a formerly construction oriented Public Works&#13;
Department (PWD) would be refocussed and strengthened as a state water agency&#13;
responsible for multi-use water planning and for providing irrigation,&#13;
drainage, flood control and bulk water supply services. Expenditures would be&#13;
refocussed to emphasize maintenance and modernization of existing facilities,&#13;
and beneficiary participation linked with cost recovery would be integral to&#13;
the service improvements. The new approach necessarily requires substantial&#13;
institutional and policy reforms for the water sector which Tamil Nadu has&#13;
already commenced. The project would assist Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN)&#13;
to implement these objectives including the funding of the associated physical&#13;
and institutional investments.&#13;
Water Resources in India&#13;
1.03 Water is an increasingly scarce resource in India. Its management in&#13;
terms of physical, economic and environmental needs is critical to economic&#13;
development. India's water resources are distributed unevenly, both spatially&#13;
and seasonally. In many states, including Tamil Nadu, development of surface&#13;
and groundwater is reaching its physical limits. Water needs to be planned&#13;
and managed holistically: planning needs to be on a multi-sectoral basis, by&#13;
river basin, recognizing the interlinkages between surface and groundwater,&#13;
and including environmental as well as quantity considerations.&#13;
1.04 Competing Uses of Water. Irrigation is the largest user of water in&#13;
India (about 93% of present gross water use). However, the National Water&#13;
Policy (Ministry of Water Resources, 1987) gives the first priority to the&#13;
provision of domestic water supplies for urban and rural populations and&#13;
assuring water supplies for livestock. Competing demands arise from industry,&#13;
thermal and hydro-power, fisheries and navigation. In addition, minimum flows&#13;
on rivers for flushing pollutants, dilution of waste water, and other&#13;
environmental concerns limit the operation of facilities. The Central Water&#13;
Commission (CWC, 1988) estimated that community needs would double, and&#13;
industrial and power requirements would increase almost seven-fold, by 2025.&#13;
While the total water demand for community use (forecast to be 40 BCM/yr in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
2025) is not high compared to the total water resources (930 BCM/yr in 2025),&#13;
localized and regional demand can lead to severe shortages, particularly for&#13;
urban areas. Thus, in future, competing uses are likely to limit the water&#13;
available for agriculture and irrigation, particularly near major metropolises&#13;
and in dry regions. These increasing demands could also force fundamental&#13;
changes in irrigation systems, cropping patterns and water use efficiency.&#13;
1.05  Agriculture and Irrigation.  Agriculture is a key sector in India's&#13;
economy, contributing about 35% of GDP and 65% of employment. Annual&#13;
agricultural growth has been modest at 2.6% p.a. over the last two decades.&#13;
India has a land area of 3.3 million km2 of which about 40% is cultivatable,&#13;
and 20% is irrigated. Irrigation has been the major source of agricultural&#13;
growth, and the pursuit of India's goal of food self-sufficiency has been&#13;
based on massive investment in irrigation. The potential of irrigation,&#13;
however, has been constrained by inadequate attention to comprehensive&#13;
planning, maintenance, water management and farmer participation. Performance&#13;
of irrigation has been stagnant in the past two decades, and in some states&#13;
has deteriorated. Significant issues must be addressed if irrigation is to&#13;
maintain and surpass past contributions to agricultural growth (India&#13;
Irrigation Sector Review, 1991, Report 9518-IN).&#13;
Development Priorities&#13;
1.06 Development plans of the Government of India (GOI) and State governments&#13;
give priority to alleviating poverty and creating employment, particularly in&#13;
the rural areas. While per capita income has increased by 2% per annum to an&#13;
average of about US$310, the impact on improvement in the standard of living&#13;
of the poor or in reducing under-employment has not been significant due to&#13;
rapid population growth. Of the total population of about 900 million, an&#13;
estimated 300 million live below the poverty line. About 74% of the&#13;
population live in rural areas, depending directly or indirectly on&#13;
agriculture. One-third of the agricultural labor force are women, and&#13;
agriculture is the main source of employment for women in rural areas. Thus,&#13;
the performance of agriculture and its main source of productivity growth,&#13;
irrigation, is intrinsically linked to poverty alleviation.&#13;
1.07 GOI's long-term strategy is to stimulate agricultural growth and promote&#13;
rural development through improved water and land management, enhanced&#13;
efficiency of irrigation and drainage networks, strengthened research&#13;
services, increased attention to environmental protection, and improved rural&#13;
infrastructure. Investment programs to address these elements and to re-&#13;
establish growth are of high priority in the Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97).&#13;
Equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and sustainability of the&#13;
resource base are also emphasized.&#13;
Tamil Nadu State&#13;
1.08 General Features. Tamil Nadu, at the southern tip of India (IBRD Map&#13;
No. 26167), has an area of 130,000 Sq. Kms and a population of 56 million of&#13;
which two-thirds are rural. About 40% of the population are below the poverty&#13;
line. Due to higher literacy and a successful family planning drive,&#13;
population is growing more slowly than the India average (1.5% in Tamil Nadu&#13;
compared with about 2.0% nationally), but population density is higher, 428&#13;
persons/sq. Km in Tamil Nadu compared with the national average of 264. Large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
urban centers include Madras (3.8 million people), Madurai and Coimbatore&#13;
(nearly 1 million each). The state's average per capita income of US$319 is&#13;
at about the national average. Relative to the rest of India, Tamil Nadu is&#13;
both land and, in particular, water short.  It has 7% of the country's&#13;
population but only 4% of the land area and 3% of the country's surface water&#13;
resources.  Water constraints in Tamil Nadu vary by basin and as influenced by&#13;
the present level of irrigation development and by urban needs. Scarcity is&#13;
acute in some areas, particularly for Madras city, for which water is being&#13;
carried in by train and road.&#13;
1.09 Water Resources. The state's average rainfall is 925 mm/annum, but is&#13;
highly variable, both year-wise and geographically. Tamil Nadu is affected by&#13;
two monsoons, the northeast monsoon (October to December, average 440&#13;
mm/annum) and the southwest monsoon (June to September, 310 mm). The&#13;
intensity of the southwest monsoon decreases from North to South. Rainfall is&#13;
highest on the coast, decreasing westwards as the impact of the northeast&#13;
monsoon diminishes.   The state's estimate of water resources is 23.6 billion&#13;
cubic meters of surface water and 22.3 billion cubic meters of groundwater.&#13;
Utilization is estimated to be 93% for surface water and 60% for groundwater.&#13;
Groundwater utilization varies by basin. In a number of localities,&#13;
especially near urban centers including around Madras, Coimbatore and Madurai&#13;
and parts of the Palar and Vaigai basins, withdrawals are causing groundwater&#13;
levels to fall. Regulatory, pricing and other actions are needed to&#13;
counteract this.&#13;
1.10 The state comprises 17 river basins (some of these are groups of several&#13;
minor basins), all flowing eastwards from the Western Ghats and Deccan&#13;
plateau. Amongst these the major rivers are the Cauvery, Palar, Vellar,&#13;
Vaigai and Tambaraparani. Tamil Nadu either contains a basin in full or is a&#13;
downstream riparian to another state, and does not share any international&#13;
rivers. For one river, the Cauvery, shared with upstream Karnataka, water&#13;
sharing has not been agreed. While basin planning in the Cauvery would be&#13;
part of the project, the WRCP contains no plans for investment in this basin.&#13;
1.11 Agriculture and Irrigation. Agriculture contributes about 22% of state&#13;
domestic product. Cultivated area is 5.9 million ha (7.6 m. ha including&#13;
multiple cropping) or 45% of the state's area, the rest being primarily&#13;
occupied by forest, hill and waste land and urban development. The main crops&#13;
are paddy (2.4 m. ha), millet and sorghum (1.6 m. ha), oilseeds (1.1 m. ha),&#13;
and pulses (0.6 m. ha). The remaining 1.9 m. ha are mainly in fruits and&#13;
vegetables, spices, sugarcane and cotton. Annual production of foodgrains has&#13;
increased from 5.4 million tons in the 1960s to 7.5 million tons in 1987/88.&#13;
Despite this gain, production since 1970 expanded more slowly than population,&#13;
and in drought years Tamil Nadu has had to import from other states. Farm&#13;
sizes tend to be uniformly very small. The average holding size is 1 ha, with&#13;
71% of holdings less than 1 ha, and 88% less than 2 ha.&#13;
1.12 Irrigation covers 2.4 million ha (41% of the state's net cropped area).&#13;
The state's irrigation system is the product of old investment, in the case of&#13;
many tanks going back several centuries or more. By the 1960s new investment&#13;
in canal and tank irrigation had peaked. Investment in wells continued&#13;
through the 1970s, but by the 1980s irrigated area from all sources of&#13;
irrigation had reached a plateau. Canal and tank irrigation supply 1.3&#13;
million net ha, and wells irrigate 1.1 million ha. New investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
opportunities are limited by water availability, but large opportunities are&#13;
available for improving the performance of existing irrigation. Neglected and&#13;
underfunded maintenance has resulted in deterioration of most systems,&#13;
unreliable water to head-end farmers, and often no water for tailenders.&#13;
There are also opportunities to complete investments on a number of commands&#13;
in order to improve the water service and provide some extension in command&#13;
area.&#13;
1.13 Environmental Needs. Actual or potential environmental concerns in&#13;
Tamil Nadu are typical of those found in the water sector for any large state&#13;
or country. No one problem is endemic state-wide and conditions vary by&#13;
basin. Groundwater resources, though overall still under-exploited, are being&#13;
depleted in a number of localities; around Madras city, Coimbatore, Madurai,&#13;
and parts of some basins such as the Vaigai basin. In some coastal belts this&#13;
has been accompanied by saline intrusion. The opposite groundwater situation&#13;
of waterlogging is also found, in generally small localities and sometimes&#13;
with localized salinization. This is often due to poor water management&#13;
resulting in excess water at head-ends of commands. Effluents from industry&#13;
(chemicals, tanneries) cause pollution on a number of rivers affecting&#13;
riverine flora and fauna and the quality of drinking water. Tree cover of&#13;
watersheds ranges from excellent to poor; in parts of basins such as&#13;
Pennaiyar, Palar and Vaigai, deforestation has resulted in excessive soil&#13;
erosion and siltation problems for canals and reservoirs. While serious water&#13;
borne diseases such as Bilharzia are not present, malaria, dysentery and other&#13;
risks can be transmitted through stagnant or organically polluted water.&#13;
Tamil Nadu is also subject to cyclones and flood damage, especially in&#13;
estuaries.&#13;
1.14 Environmental management capabilities are present in Tamil Nadu's&#13;
specialized agencies - for instance, the Pollution Control Board, Public&#13;
Works, Public Health, Forestry, Agricultural, Fisheries and Wildlife&#13;
Departments, and Water and Drainage Board, together with good university and&#13;
research center capability. But coordination between them is limited. No&#13;
apparatus has existed for tackling such issues from a basin approach, and for&#13;
planning water development comprehensively incorporating environmental&#13;
management in investment decisions, including better representation from the&#13;
general public and private sectors. Within Tamil Nadu's main water agency -&#13;
the Water Resources Organization, recently created from the irrigation wing of&#13;
the Public Works Department (para 1.16) - technical skills in environmental&#13;
monitoring, assessment and management also need strengthening.&#13;
1.15 Water Resources Institutions. The Public Works Department (PWD) has&#13;
been responsible for construction, maintenance and operation of the state's&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems, bulk water supply for municipalities, and&#13;
flood control. Several entities also come under the Secretary PWD and would&#13;
be important to the WRCP. The Institute of Water Studies (IWS), located in&#13;
Madras has handled water planning and research, but until recently has not had&#13;
the mandate to coordinate with other sectors. The Institute of Hydraulics and&#13;
Hydrology (IHH) at Poondi is PWD's hydraulic research agency. The Irrigation&#13;
Management and Training Institute (IMTI) at Trichy provides training for PWD&#13;
engineers and farmers. The two other major water agencies are the Tamil Nadu&#13;
Water and Drainage Board (TWAD), which provides water supply, drainage and&#13;
sewerage for towns and villages, and Metrowater, which provides similar&#13;
services for Madras. A strong academic and research capability exists in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Tamil Nadu's universities. This includes, for the water and agriculture&#13;
sectors, Anna University, Coimbatore Agriculture University, the Madras&#13;
Institute of Technology and the Madras Institute of Development Studies.&#13;
However, closer coordination between the above institutions is a recognised&#13;
need.&#13;
1.16 PWD has had a long tradition as the state's construction agency,&#13;
covering many activities from irrigation to buildings. This has given it&#13;
civil works expertise, but within irrigation less funding and staff emphasis&#13;
has been put to water management, maintenance and water planning. Over time,&#13;
the organization became progressively less equipped to handle the increasingly&#13;
demanding requirements of the state's water sector. Accordingly, to meet&#13;
Tamil Nadu's new objectives for the water sector, and as part of its&#13;
preparation for the WRCP, Government decided to create a specialist water&#13;
resources agency. Following a detailed institutional study, PWD was&#13;
bifurcated in April 1994 to create a specialized "Water Resources&#13;
Organization" (WRO), separate from buildings and other traditional PWD&#13;
functions. WRO and its sub-entities - IWS, IHH and IMTI - will be solely&#13;
handling the water sector in two principal capacities: as state water planner&#13;
and coordinator between sectors, and as implementor for irrigation, drainage,&#13;
flood control and bulk water supply. This is being accompanied by a major&#13;
internal reorganization (para 2.24 and Annex 2). The objectives are to create&#13;
a decentralized and more functionally effective management, organized along&#13;
basin lines, specialization in functional areas such as planning, design,&#13;
construction, operations and maintenance, and establishment or strengthening&#13;
of capabilities in management information systems, programming and budgeting,&#13;
procurement, environmental management, regulatory, training, staff development&#13;
and other areas. An institutional apparatus has also been established for&#13;
state coordination of water planning and environmental management between&#13;
sectors (para 2.21). Farmer participation in irrigation management is also a&#13;
central objective, and a vigorous drive to implement this is already underway.&#13;
Experience with Past Bank Lending&#13;
1.17 Experience in India. India's agricultural development efforts have&#13;
attracted substantial support from the Bank Group. To date, 131 agricultural&#13;
projects in India have received US$10.5 billion equivalent of IBRD/IDA&#13;
financing (81% IDA and 19% Bank), the majority of which has been for&#13;
irrigation. Projects have also included: agricultural support services&#13;
(credit, research and extension); commercial agriculture (seeds, fisheries&#13;
and agro-industry); forestry, watershed and resource conservation; livestock&#13;
development; and drought assistance. The objectives of Bank involvement in&#13;
Indian agriculture have been to expand and modernize the infrastructure&#13;
supporting sectoral growth, strengthen the institutions serving agriculture,&#13;
increase the production of high value commodities, and introduce sustainable&#13;
land management systems affecting rainfed agriculture.  Common problems in&#13;
agricultural projects have been: (a) delays in project mobilization and&#13;
procurement; (b) quality of civil works; (c) institutional weaknesses; and&#13;
(d) insufficient local funding.&#13;
1.18 Experience in Tamil Nadu. In the irrigation sector the Periyar Vaigai&#13;
Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1468-IN/SF16-IN) financed extension and improvement&#13;
of the old Periyar Vaigai system in southern Tamil Nadu and closed on October&#13;
31, 1993. The Project Completion Report concluded that the project, while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
slow in implementation, met its physical objectives and achieved an ERR of&#13;
25%. Sustainability was also considered satisfactory. Other positive&#13;
features included successful piloting of cultivator group participation in&#13;
water management, good construction quality, and accelerated implementation in&#13;
the last two years of the project. In other sectors related to water, the&#13;
Madras Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Cr. 1822/Ln.2846), and the Tamil&#13;
Nadu Urban Project (Cr. 1923), both ongoing, have, inter alia, encouraged&#13;
water planning initiatives. GOTN is currently preparing a Veeranam Water&#13;
Supply Project (for supply of bulk water to Madras) and a follow-on Madras&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Project for consideration by the Bank. The&#13;
project with the greatest relevance to the WRCP is the National Water&#13;
Management Project ("NWMP",Credit 1770-IN), which has enabled the gaining of&#13;
field experience for the WRCP's principal component. Under NWMP, seven&#13;
commands in Tamil Nadu covering 153,000 ha have been rehabilitated and&#13;
modernized. After a hesitant start, Tamil Nadu has been implementing this&#13;
project well and with enthusiasm over the past three years, as it experiences&#13;
the yield and social benefits of improved water management. This momentum has&#13;
facilitated preparation of the WRCP's main component which has similar&#13;
engineering features to NWMP, and has also enabled commencement in the field&#13;
of WRCP pre-investment and farmer organization activities, enhancing prospects&#13;
for rapid project start-up.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.01 The project would help implement the Bank's and GOI's new strategy for&#13;
the water and irrigation sector, as defined in the recent Bank policy paper&#13;
and the India Irrigation Sector Review. The Bank's new strategy ("Water&#13;
Resources Management", September 1993), proposes an agenda of policies and&#13;
institutional reforms that will utilize market forces and strengthen the&#13;
capacity of governments to carry out their essential roles in resource use and&#13;
planning. The policy paper calls for the adoption of a comprehensive&#13;
framework for analyzing policies and management options regarding water&#13;
scarcity, efficiency of service, allocation of water and environmental damage.&#13;
2.02 Specific to India, the "India Irrigation Sector Review" (Report 9518-IN,&#13;
December, 1991), prepared jointly with GOI and state governments, identified&#13;
four priority areas of action consistent with the above: (i) multisectoral&#13;
water resources policy and planning using river basins as planning units;&#13;
(ii) institutional development to upgrade management capability of irrigation&#13;
departments through improved functional responsibilities, institutional&#13;
accountability and participation of farmers and the private sector; (iii)&#13;
redefined public expenditure priorities, emphasizing improved performance of&#13;
existing schemes, enhanced operations and maintenance, completion of viable&#13;
incomplete projects and improved cost recovery linked to service improvements;&#13;
and (iv) improved technical performance of water and irrigation service&#13;
delivery including improved environmental management. The project also&#13;
supports the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India of May 1995.&#13;
The CAS emphasizes investment lending operations providing comprehensive&#13;
support to policy, institutional, and expenditure reform for key sectors in&#13;
states receptive to reform. Reforms would be accompanied by investments in&#13;
basic infrastructure supporting increased productivity and better management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
of natural resources. Better institutional and financial performance in the&#13;
public sector, complemented by devolution of responsibilities to stakeholders&#13;
and the private sector, is also emphasized.&#13;
2.03 The project would be a significant step towards implementation of Bank&#13;
and Government strategy in the water sector. In India, water development and&#13;
irrigation is planned and implemented at the state level, requiring a state-&#13;
by-state approach. WRCPs would be the main vehicle for Bank support to the&#13;
states. This project is the second WRCP (following Haryana WRCP, Cr 2592,&#13;
approved in FY94). Each provides the concerned state with the comprehensive&#13;
means to implement the new strategy. The Bank also has a strong interest in&#13;
supporting initiatives in hydrology and water management across states, as&#13;
this would lead to more rational allocation and use of water in the national&#13;
context. Such projects are also being developed by India. To implement the&#13;
new water and irrigation strategy, for both the state specific WRCPs and&#13;
multi-state projects supporting resolution of cross-state issues, a close and&#13;
continuous partnership with the states and central government is required.&#13;
The Bank is one of the few institutions that can provide the continuity and&#13;
policy support required for achieving the long-term strategic goals developed&#13;
in the sector strategy papers above. Choice of Tamil Nadu is because it is&#13;
one of India's most water constrained states and because of the interest of&#13;
the state Government in reforming its water and irrigation sector.&#13;
WRCP PreDaration and Policy Reforms&#13;
2.04 The project was prepared in the 1993-94 period. Over the past two years&#13;
Tamil Nadu has implemented a number of institutional and policy reforms in&#13;
preparation for the WRCP: (i) a fundamental decision was to create a&#13;
specialist Water Resources Organisation (WRO) from the former construction&#13;
oriented irrigation wing of PWD (para 1.16). This will handle state-wide&#13;
provision of irrigation and drainage, bulk water supply and flood control and&#13;
also be responsible for coordinating state water planning across sectors.&#13;
Within the new WRO, a staff reorganization is underway to create streamlined&#13;
and decentralized management and functionally specialized management units;&#13;
(ii) a Water Resources Control and Review Council (WRCRC) and supporting&#13;
institutional linkages have also been created to handle multi-sectoral water&#13;
planning and allocation; (iii) a State Water Policy has been formulated to&#13;
backstop Tamil Nadu's new approach to water and irrigation management; (iv)&#13;
priorities for public expenditures have been overhauled, with emphasis now on&#13;
maintenance and improved water management rather than new construction; (v)&#13;
state financial allocations for maintenance have been doubled to bring them up&#13;
to Bank/WRO recommended amounts; (vi) a program to involve farmers in&#13;
irrigation investment, operations and maintenance has been prepared and&#13;
implementation commenced; (vii) WRO's institutional capability for&#13;
environmental management has been strengthened and an Environmental Action&#13;
Plan prepared; and (viii) a new structure and procedures for handling land&#13;
acquisition have been established and a Land Acquisition and Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plan prepared.&#13;
2.05  The project is ready for implementation.  Start-up activities during&#13;
1994 and 1995 have been intensive, with 1994/95 expenditures proposed for&#13;
retroactive financing (para 3.15).  As concerns the project's two main&#13;
components - the systems improvement and farmer turnover program, and the&#13;
scheme completions program - detailed design is complete, staff divisions have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
been allocated by work-site, and procurement packaging encompasses 70% of&#13;
contract packages over the seven-year project period and the full needs for&#13;
the first two years of the project. Implementation starts from the strong&#13;
base of successful performance under the National Water Management Project for&#13;
the systems improvement works, and already active work-sites as regards the&#13;
scheme completions. Readiness as concerns other project components is also&#13;
satisfactory. The new institutional structure is defined and agreed, the&#13;
water planning program has been underway since mid-1993; and training,&#13;
staffing and other preparatory actions for the Environmental Action Plan and&#13;
the Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plan are advanced.&#13;
Most impressive has been the degree to which GOTN and its Water Resources&#13;
Organisation have emphasized early completion of all institutional and policy&#13;
decisions required for the project, including issuance of some two dozen&#13;
"Government Orders". These have formalized matters ranging from issuance of&#13;
the State Water Policy to adjusted policies for compensation in cases of land&#13;
acquisition, to the Institutional Reorganisation. WRO has also been active in&#13;
staff training in areas relevant to the WRCP.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
2.06 Project Obiectives. Tamil Nadu's future economic development and&#13;
welfare require better planning and management of water across sectors,&#13;
environmentally sustainable planning and management and, for irrigation, the&#13;
largest user of water, improved efficiency of public expenditures and water&#13;
use and enhanced agricultural productivity. The project's primary objectives&#13;
would be to: (a) introduce water resources planning by river basins across&#13;
all uses of water; (b) improve agricultural productivity through&#13;
modernization and completion of irrigation systems, upgraded water management&#13;
and farmer participation; (c) assure sustainability of water infrastructure&#13;
and the environment; and (d) improve institutional and technical capability&#13;
for managing the state's water resources.&#13;
2.07 Project Description. The project would be a sector investment loan&#13;
financing an agreed state-wide program to improve the productivity and&#13;
sustainability of Tamil Nadu's irrigation sector, to introduce multi-sectoral&#13;
water planning, to integrate farmers in irrigation management, and to&#13;
strengthen the state's institutional and technical capacity in water&#13;
development, management and planning. The project would be implemented over&#13;
seven years. Project components would be:&#13;
(a)   System Improvement and Farmer Turnover (US$143.1 million, 55% of&#13;
project investment base costs).&#13;
(b)   Scheme Comrpletions (US$76.8 million, 29% of investment base costs).&#13;
(c)   Water Planning, Environmental Management and Research (US$21.0 million,&#13;
8% of investment base costs);&#13;
(d)   Institutional Strenathenina (US$17.7 million, 7% of investment base&#13;
costs); and&#13;
(e)   Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation (US$3.9 million, 1% of&#13;
investment base costs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
C. Detailed Features&#13;
I.    System ImDrovement and Farmer Turnover  (US$ 143.1 million, 55% of&#13;
investment base cost, Annex 4)&#13;
2.08 The WRCP's largest expenditure item and field effort would be the&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation, drainage and bulk&#13;
water supply facilities. This would be integrally associated with beneficiary&#13;
participation in scheme investment and management decisions and turnover of&#13;
water management and maintenance of distributaries to farmers.   Most of Tamil&#13;
Nadu's water delivery and drainage systems are performing below potential due&#13;
to outdated design, inadequate maintenance and lack of farmer involvement in&#13;
the design and management of the systems. As a result, water services are&#13;
increasingly becoming unreliable and inequitable, affecting agricultural&#13;
productivity. There is excess water in the upper reaches and tail-end farmers&#13;
do not receive adequate and timely supply of water.&#13;
2.09 Integrated ADproach. The National Water Management Project (NWMP, para&#13;
1.18) has succesfully piloted the engineering required to correct this&#13;
situation by rehabilitating and modernizing 153,000 ha in 7 commands in the&#13;
state. The WRCP incorporates the lessons learned under NWMP, but also&#13;
emphasizes the integration of infrastructural improvements with O&amp;M funding&#13;
and farmer participation, associated with strengthened institutional&#13;
capability. In doing so, the project also reflects the general lesson in&#13;
Indian irrigation, and indeed worldwide, that: (i) efforts at cost recovery&#13;
without service improvement are mostly unsuccessful; and (ii) infrastructure&#13;
improvements without attention to O&amp;M and farmer participation are physically,&#13;
financially and institutionally unsustainable. Sustained improvement in&#13;
performance is emphasized under the project, recognizing that this requires&#13;
mutually reinforcing actions.&#13;
2.10 Infrastructural Improvements. System improvements would cover about&#13;
660,000 ha, constituting 50% of the State's surface irrigated area, under a&#13;
phased, two-stage investment program. The first stage is technically similar&#13;
to NWMP, but will include innovations based on consultation with NWMP farmers&#13;
and other field experiences. Stage I comprises focussed low investment&#13;
improvement to enable more equitable and reliable water supply, based on a&#13;
detailed command diagnostic (crops, yields, hydrology, current performance and&#13;
problems) followed by preparation of a "plan of operations and maintenance'&#13;
(POM) and identification and design of the infrastructure improvements to make&#13;
this work. Under stage I, priority design changes and structural&#13;
improvements would be carried out in association with farmers on about 508,000&#13;
ha to ensure reliable irrigation to the tail-end sections in 10 major and&#13;
medium commands and about 40 minor schemes (98,000 ha). The central feature&#13;
of the design change would be the structuring of the system, usually at the&#13;
distributary, sometimes at the minor level. Below this level, control&#13;
structures will be provided at all offtake canals to distribute water in the&#13;
desired proportion without manual control. The costs of the rehabilitation&#13;
and modernization works under stage I will average Rs 5300/ha (US$ 166) in&#13;
1994 prices, to ensure a focus on top priorities.&#13;

2.11   Under  stage  II,  a second round of  investment  to  further  improve&#13;
performance and conveyance efficiency, especially at distributary levels,&#13;
would be undertaken for commands successfully through stage I. Investment&#13;
would be conditional on farmer commitment and would be associated at&#13;
distributary level with formal handover of O&amp;M to farmers. In the WRCP&#13;
period, this is expected to be primarily on the ex-NWMP commands (153,000 ha).&#13;
Stage II improvements are primarily the construction of regulatory structures&#13;
and selective upgradation of canal lining, with an average cost of Rs 7900/ha.&#13;
The total base costs of the stage I and II works is US$ 84.2 and 37.6 million,&#13;
respectively. For all major and medium commands (85% of the program),&#13;
detailed designs and procurement schedules have been prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
2.12 Farmer Organization. The participation of water users would be closely&#13;
tied to the physical improvements (Annex 4). The centerpiece of the&#13;
participation program is a progressively increased involvement of farmers,&#13;
moving from consultation to active management of O&amp;M below the structured&#13;
level. A 3-tier structure of farmer organization (FO) would be developed as&#13;
part of the public-private sector partnership between farmers and WRO. At the&#13;
lowest level (about 40-50 ha) would be outlet level organizations ("sluice&#13;
committees"), federating into a "Farmers Council" at the distributary level&#13;
(about 500-700 ha) where most of the formal negotiations with the WRO would&#13;
initially occur. Councils would further federate into an "Apex Committee" at&#13;
the scheme level for consultations and agreements on overall water management&#13;
and on inter-distributary issues. During stage I, farmer councils would&#13;
formally establish as registered societies and enter into a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding (MOU) with WRO. The councils would also collect from their&#13;
members Rs 250/ha, placing collections in a council bank account. Interest&#13;
earned would substantially pay the council's annual cash costs (the rest being&#13;
farmer supplied labor) of maintenance below the distributary head, which would&#13;
be their responsibility. Formal turnover of O&amp;M responsibilities to Farmer&#13;
Councils would be accompanied by intensive training and also involve an&#13;
interim period (typically 6-9 months) of "joint management". The MOU defines&#13;
the mutual responsibilities and rights of the FOs and WRO in terms of water&#13;
services and O&amp;M duties. A model MOU and by-laws for the FOs was formally&#13;
issued by GOTN prior to negotiations (Attachment C of Annex 4).&#13;
2.13 Distributary level improvements would be contingent upon the formation&#13;
of FOs: their participation and agreement on the nature of the works; and&#13;
their acceptance of O&amp;M responsibilities, including financing, after the&#13;
investments are completed. Canal lining, the most expensive item of stage II&#13;
works, would be taken up selectively and only when it is part of a jointly set&#13;
priority improvement and when farmers collect 20% of the cost of lining.&#13;
Farmer contributions would be paid into council bank accounts to further&#13;
capitalize their capacity to undertake O&amp;M and improvement works in the&#13;
future. The above arrangements (paras 2.12 to 2.13) were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
2.14 On-Farm DeveloDment Works. Farmer participation would extend to"OFD"&#13;
works as well, previously constructed by the Agricultural Engineering&#13;
Department (AED). OFD (sluice command works such as water courses, field&#13;
channels and field drains) provides the important link between the irrigation&#13;
system and farmer's fields, but needs to involve farmers and a lower cost&#13;
approach if investment is to be affordable and sustained. The WRCP will&#13;
support the state's program, with changes from past practice, and special&#13;
arrangements where AED is already present in a command. Under the WRCP, FOs&#13;
would decide on the need for OFD, and assistance to OFD would be extended only&#13;
in outlets where higher level Farmer's Councils are organized and the sluice&#13;
has an active sluice committee. The WRO would undertake a topographic survey&#13;
and propose designs for the distribution channels below the outlet. After&#13;
mutual consultation and agreement with farmers, alignment structures would be&#13;
constructed by WRO and farmers would construct the watercourses and field&#13;
channels themselves. WRO costs would be about Rs 720/ha compared with Rs&#13;
3500/ha as per present practices with government taking full resposibility.&#13;
About 425,000 ha are targeted under the WRCP, costing Rs 307 million in total.&#13;
The Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1) affirms that the new model for OFD&#13;
would be used henceforth throughout the state by both WRO and AED and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
AED's activities in WRCP commands would be limited to the five commands where&#13;
it is already active (Lower Bhavani, Periyar Vaigai, PAP, Sathanur and&#13;
Sethiathope). In these five commands, WRO and AED would both handle OFD&#13;
works, but activities would be phased with WRO's work on main and distributary&#13;
systems, and AED's program would be coordinated with the WRO executive&#13;
engineer for the command concerned. Arrangements would be reviewed annually&#13;
between WRO and AED for their implementation effectiveness.&#13;
2.15 Organization. Training and Eauipment. Under WRO's reorganisation, O&amp;M&#13;
will become a specialist activity under the new post of CE O&amp;M, with deputies&#13;
in the areas of operations, maintenance and farmer organization (Annex 2).&#13;
Staff reorientation and skill building needs are substantial. Accordingly,&#13;
WRO's Irrigation Management and Training Institute's (IMTI) program has been&#13;
refocussed to place emphasis in particular on farmer organization, and also on&#13;
technical aspects of systems improvement and O&amp;M. Farmer organization teams&#13;
on each command will also be reinforced by community organizers recruited from&#13;
practical NGOS, backstopped by experienced consultants (para 4.04).&#13;
Management features for the systems improvement and farmer turnover program&#13;
incorporate intensive management and monitoring features, including a detailed&#13;
review by consultants in PY2 to enable early adjustments as experience is&#13;
gained (para 4.05). Adjustments are especially likely as regards the support&#13;
measures and approach for farmer participation and turnover. The project&#13;
would finance strengthening of IMTI (technical assistance, training and&#13;
equipment amounting to US$ 1.4 million) and equipment, training and&#13;
consultancies for farmer turnover (US$ 1.6 million). For operations and&#13;
maintenance, a one-time investment, aggregating to US$ 10.9 million base&#13;
costs, would be made in heavy equipment, surveying equipment and workshops&#13;
(US$ 6.3 million), vehicles (US$ 2.6 million), wireless communication (US$ 1.4&#13;
million) and remote sensing consultancy (US$ 0.6 million), to bring WRO to&#13;
full capability. GOTN would fully finance annual maintenance. Following its&#13;
undertaking to this effect at the beginning of project preparation, GOTN has&#13;
already brought funding levels up to estimated annual requirements (para&#13;
2.34).&#13;
II.   Scheme Completions  (US$ 76.8 million, 29% of investment base cost,&#13;
Annex 5).&#13;
2.16 The second largest investment expenditure under WRO's program would be&#13;
scheme completion investments to improve the reliability and availability of&#13;
agricultural and domestic water supply on nine existing schemes, plus a&#13;
contingency for future investment needs (para 2.17). The nine scheme&#13;
completions, all underway and in five cases with substantial investment&#13;
incurred, typically involve small impoundments and improvement of the existing&#13;
irrigation and drainage networks, including domestic water supply to local&#13;
communities. The principal impact would be in stabilization of the command's&#13;
water supply to existing irrigated areas, plus some expansion of irrigated&#13;
area. Benefits are primarily from higher yields, and increased irrigation&#13;
intensity, with unquantified likely benefits from diversification to higher&#13;
value-more water sensitive crops, and potential longer-term water diversion&#13;
for industrial use. The nine schemes were selected on the basis of an earlier&#13;
candidate list of 20 schemes, and detailed analysis by FAOCP and WRO of a&#13;
short-list of 13 schemes. The analysis included an operational hydrology&#13;
assessment of water supply reliability, as well as engineering, agriculture&#13;
and environmental impact features and economic viability (Annex 5). In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
process, outdated existing unit cost rates have been augmented, and&#13;
implementation schedules extended, both on the basis of past experience.&#13;
Final selection was made at appraisal and included the requirement of an&#13;
economic rate of return of 12% or more (para 5.06), corresponding to the&#13;
estimated opportunity cost of capital in India. The preparation exercise has&#13;
served to inject additional analytical rigor into WRO's investment&#13;
preparation, particularly in the areas of hydrological, environmental and&#13;
economic analysis.   As described below, WRO intends to apply the analytical&#13;
procedures developed with FAOCP and the Bank in its future investment&#13;
formulation work.&#13;

2.17  As water planning is further established under the WRCP, perceived&#13;
medium and long-term needs will evolve, and the growing needs of urban centers&#13;
are likely to increasingly dominate investment choice. The urgent bulk water&#13;
supply needs of Madras would be catered for by the proposed Second Madras&#13;
Water Supply Project (from Veeranam tank providing 3tmc) primarily under&#13;
Metrowater/TWAD responsibility, and by Government's Krishna Water Supply&#13;
project (KWSP), under WRO responsibility, which will supply 15 tmc of water&#13;
under an agreement with Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu's part of KWSP is&#13;
virtually fully complete (completion expected in 1995) and is thus not&#13;
included in WRO's program above. Other bulk water supply needs are likely,&#13;
however, to arise. An amount of US$6.8 million, equivalent to 10% of the&#13;
combined base costs of the nine scheme completions above, has thus been&#13;
allocated for disbursement against as yet unidentified needs, urban or&#13;
agricultural, as determined by water planning and governed by rigorous&#13;
analytical and selection criteria. At negotiations, the preparation and&#13;
selection criteria outlined at Annex 15 ("Criteria for Preparation and&#13;
Selection of Investment") were agreed with GOTN. IDA's approval would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
required prior to selection of any such new proposal and would be based on the&#13;
investment satisfying the criteria at Annex 15. These include preparation in&#13;
the context of a river basin plan, satisfactory environmental assessment,&#13;
socioeconomic survey and, as needed, land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation plan, and a rate of return not less than 12%.&#13;
III. Water Planning, Environmental Management and Research (US$21.1 million,&#13;
8% of investment base cost, Annexes 3, 7 and 8))&#13;
Water Planning (Annex 3)&#13;
2.18    GOTN established the institutional apparatus for water planning during&#13;
WRCP preparation. At the apex is a "Water Resources Control and Review&#13;
Council" (WRCRC) established in September 1993 as the state's most senior body&#13;
for water allocation and planning decisions. Chaired by the Chief Minister&#13;
and with the three key Ministers involved (PWD, Water Resources and Energy;&#13;
Urban Development; and Rural Development) as Vice Chairmen, the Council&#13;
contains representation of all departments concerned with usage and&#13;
environmental management of water. At basin level, WRO's basin managers will&#13;
head "basin water planning and allocation committees" comprising the local&#13;
parties involved including private sector representatives. WRO's "Institute&#13;
of Water Studies" (IWS) has been appointed as Secretariat to the WRCRC and as&#13;
Tamil Nadu's nodal agency for preparation of basin and state water plans. In&#13;
collaboration with the basin committees and coordination officers from each&#13;
state government department, IWS has been charged with preparation and&#13;
periodic adjustment of basin plans and a state water plan. An environmental&#13;
sub-committee of WRCRC and an environmental unit in IWS has also been&#13;
established to provide special focus on integrating environmental management&#13;
in water planning (para 2.20). WRO's capabilities in hydrological data&#13;
measurement and collation are also to be upgraded, with assistance from Tamil&#13;
Nadu's component of the proposed National Hydrology Project (NHP). For this&#13;
purpose, a State Water Resources Data Center has been established in WRO.&#13;
2.19 Basin and state water planning will be progressively upgraded during the&#13;
WRCP. The first task, commenced in 1993, has been preparation of rapid basin&#13;
assessments on 16 of Tamil Nadu's basins/sub-basins, with completion of the&#13;
remaining basin expected by end 1995. A Tamil Nadu state "Framework Water&#13;
Resources Plan" will then be prepared on the basis of the basin plans and&#13;
state development objectives (by December 31, 1995). Detailed River Basin&#13;
Plans will subsequently be prepared, followed by a State Water Plan by March&#13;
31, 1998. Thereafter, the basin plans and the State Water Plan will be&#13;
periodically improved and updated. This effort will require substantial&#13;
technical support and strengthening of IWS, a process already commenced with&#13;
consultant assistance. WRCP funding covers international and local&#13;
consultancy assistance for IWS, training for IWS staff, and computer and other&#13;
equipment. The latter includes establishment of remote sensing interpretation&#13;
and geographic information systems capability. The above arrangements and&#13;
timetable are affirmed in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).&#13;
Environmental Management and Action Plan (Annex 7)&#13;
2.20 Based on the recommendations of a Category A Sectoral Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA), conducted by PWD/WRO and HR Wallingford consultants,&#13;
environmental management has been integrated in all aspects of the WRCP, from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
institutional and policy aspects to specific sub-components. The EA provided&#13;
a detailed review of water related environmental issues in the state, assessed&#13;
the investment components of the project and also reviewed state and in&#13;
particular WRO capacity to handle environmental issues. The investment&#13;
components themselves were not found to pose particular issues. The improved&#13;
water management resulting from the project's rehabilitation, modernization&#13;
and scheme completion investment was assessed to mitigate against problems&#13;
such as waterlogging, salinization, depletion of groundwater levels and&#13;
disease risks caused by sources of stagnant water. The EA did, however,&#13;
recommend a comprehensive set of actions to improve WRO's environmental&#13;
capability to monitor, plan, develop and manage the state's water resources.&#13;
These measures, which incorporate institutional and procedural improvements,&#13;
major strengthening of technical capabilities, and field actions and studies,&#13;
have been incorporated in an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) to be funded&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.21 The EAP includes the following actions (Annex 7): (a) establishment of&#13;
environmental units in IWS and the Project Formulation directorate,&#13;
respectively handling environmental concerns in state water planning and&#13;
allocation, and environmental assessment during preparation of specific sub-&#13;
projects. These would be supported through small cells at the level of each&#13;
basin manager; (b) establishment of a unit in WRO charged with groundwater&#13;
regulation; (c) consolidation of WRO's water data collection activities&#13;
including water quality under a state Water Resources Data Center (to be&#13;
funded under the proposed NHP, para 2.18); (d) preparation of a Groundwater&#13;
Act for regulation of groundwater usage; (e) establishment and usage of a&#13;
construction code of practice incorporating environmental safeguards; (f)&#13;
funding of a program for eco-restoration of catchments with depleted&#13;
vegetative cover and resultant soil erosion and siltation; and (g) special&#13;
studies, monitoring and demonstrations in groundwater utilisation, catchment&#13;
interlinkages, soil conservation planning, pesticide impacts, sedimentation,&#13;
reservoir environmental quality, wastewater reuse, pollution and health&#13;
hazards. The EAP would be supported with funding of consultancies, training&#13;
and equipment (US$3.6 million) and funds for the largest field component,&#13;
catchment management (US$1.9 million). As environmental management expertise&#13;
is limited in WRO and the water user community, training and technical&#13;
assistance to upgrade skills are extensive. Training would cover not only the&#13;
specialist needs of the staff in WRO's environmental units, but also awareness&#13;
building for WRO engineers and the general public.&#13;
Water Sector Research (Annex 8)&#13;
2.22 The new challenges to be embarked upon under the WRCP will require&#13;
significant innovation, problem solving and technology transfer for WRO and&#13;
related institutions. Creating this will be important, in part for the&#13;
immediate WRCP needs, but also as an investment for the future. Mechanisms&#13;
for harnessing Tamil Nadu based expertise in the university and non-Government&#13;
sector are needed. For WRO, other government agencies and Tamil Nadu's&#13;
universities and research institutes, linkages with technology, expertise and&#13;
ideas abroad and elsewhere in India are also important.   As discussed in&#13;
GOTN's letter of Development Policy, a "Water Resources Research Fund" (WRRF)&#13;
has been set up by WRO under the WRCP to support these objectives. Funds&#13;
would be provided by WRO on a grant basis to research proposals approved on&#13;
the basis of their relevance to Tamil Nadu water sector issues. IDA would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
reimburse WRO against eligible WRO expenditures for such research contracts&#13;
(US$ 3 million of IDA funding is estimated required during the WRCP period).&#13;
Priority would be given to: cross-sectoral issues in water management and&#13;
planning; engineering and hydrology; environmental issues; basin planning&#13;
and modelling; water markets and prices; groundwater regulation and pricing;&#13;
farmer and other user participation; roles of women, marginal farmers and&#13;
other target groups; and water efficient irrigation and new technologies&#13;
(Annex 8, para 9). All research proposals would require some participation&#13;
from a Tamil Nadu located institution, but the WRRF would encourage and&#13;
actively favor collaboration with other Indian or overseas institutions.&#13;
2.23 The WRRF would be administered and funded through WRO, but would be&#13;
guided by a six member Research Advisory Committee (RAC). This would comprise&#13;
five senior experts, not in active Government service, with experience in&#13;
water resource engineering, agriculture, environmental science, economics and&#13;
social sciences, and with at least one member with experience in the urban and&#13;
industrial sector, and the EIC or his delegate as member-secretary. The RAC&#13;
would be responsible for reviewing proposals, and would also be proactive in&#13;
organizing workshops of relevance, identifying problems and research needs and&#13;
advertising the existence of WRRF. It would also undertake annual review of&#13;
WRO's own research related activities. To enable progressive establishment of&#13;
a permanent fund, GOTN would contribute quarterly to an interest earning&#13;
account in the name of WRRF an amount equal to one-third of IDA disbursements&#13;
to WRO on fund related activities in the previous quarter. IDA would thus not&#13;
directly finance the fund - disbursements would be made against eligible&#13;
contracts under the WRRF program - but GOTN's contributions would&#13;
progressively build up the fund. The program would be reviewed by IDA&#13;
annually, on the basis of an annual report prepared by the RAC. The above&#13;
arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
IV.   Institutional Reforms (US$17.7 million, 7% of investment base cost,&#13;
Annex 2)&#13;
2.24 Based on an Institutional Study undertaken by PWD with consultant&#13;
assistance during WRCP preparation, and review by GOTN and the Bank, PWD is&#13;
undergoing major reorganization to create a specialist state water agency.&#13;
This and the associated institutional strengthening to be funded under the&#13;
WRCP will be fundamental to the sustained drive to improve water sector&#13;
performance under the WRCP and beyond, and important to the success of all&#13;
project components. In March 1994, GOTN announced by Government Order the&#13;
bifurcation of PWD to create a "Water Resources Organisation" (WRO), divested&#13;
of all non-water sector related activities. It was also announced that the&#13;
WRO would involve an internal reorganization to create functionally&#13;
specialized sub-units and decentralization of line management along river&#13;
basin lines. Reorganisation has already commenced for several of WROs&#13;
management units, including creation in March 1995 of an Engineer-in-Chief&#13;
(EIC) position to head the WRO (the former post of CE Irrigation and General&#13;
needed to be upgraded so that the authority of the head of WRO was clearly&#13;
established).&#13;
2.25 The detailed changes agreed with the new WRO have the following&#13;
principal effects: (a) a single head of the WRO at EIC level; (b) reduction&#13;
to a manageable number of sub-units reporting to the EIC; (c) decentralized&#13;
management of field activities through four Chief Engineer (CE) level "basin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
managers" with boundaries corresponding to boundaries of river basins or&#13;
groups of basins; (d) reorganization at headquarters around the following&#13;
functionally specialized units, each headed by a Chief Engineer: plan&#13;
formulation; design, construction and research; operations and maintenance;&#13;
and state water resources data center; plus water planning under IWS (para&#13;
2.18) and training support through IMTI (para 2.15); (e) creation of&#13;
management support units for: programming and budgeting, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and strengthening of administration; and, (f) creation of a&#13;
groundwater regulatory directorate (para 2.38) and a special office for land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation (para 2.28). Descriptions of the new&#13;
functions and organigrams are at Annex 2. Reorganization along the above&#13;
lines is currently underway and is being assisted by a visiting consultant.&#13;
The ensuing strengthening in all capability areas of the new WRO will require&#13;
sustained effort by WRO over a number of years, and substantial training and&#13;
consultancy support (para 4.02). The WRCP provides funding in support of&#13;
these objectives for consultancy, training, study tours, equipment and&#13;
vehicles. At negotiations, the organizational charts and details at Annex 2&#13;
were reviewed and confirmed.&#13;
V.    Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation (US$3.9 million, 1% of&#13;
investment base cost, Annex 9)&#13;
2.26 The project's Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plan&#13;
(LAERAP) described at Annex 9, provides a comprehensive program, to be funded&#13;
under the project, to enable all project affected persons (PAPs) to maintain&#13;
or improve their incomes and welfare on a sustainable basis. The Action Plan&#13;
comprises: (i) establishment of an organisational structure to handle water&#13;
sector LAER; (ii) adjustments in policies and procedures for LAER to enable&#13;
compensation and economic rehabilitation to be fully responsive to the needs&#13;
of PAPs; (iii) improved entitlements for PAPs; and (iv) site specific&#13;
implementation programs on the basis of sub-project LAERAPs with&#13;
implementation assisted by NGOs. The comprehensive measures on the&#13;
institutional, policy and procedural front have been designed to establish&#13;
permanent capability for future LAER in Tamil Nadu's water sector, thus&#13;
enabling benefits beyond the specific needs of the WRCP investment program&#13;
itself.&#13;
2.27 A baseline consultant's survey has found that the WRCP investment&#13;
program would involve, statewide, acquisition of some 570 ha of farmed land&#13;
involving about 1460 project affected persons (PAPs) (approximately 710&#13;
households). No village residential sites are being relocated, although&#13;
(statewide) 12 dwellings would be affected. The needs of all PAPs would be&#13;
catered for under the WRCP, based on completed detailed socio-economic surveys&#13;
and Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (LAERAPs)&#13;
undertaken by consultants and WRO, with PAP participation, for each of the&#13;
scheme completion sites where LAER is involved. The project's LAER component&#13;
would remedy several past weaknesses in Tamil Nadu. The measures comprise:&#13;
(a) strengthening of the institutional capacity to expedite LAER through&#13;
establishment of a special cell for LAER within the WRO and district level&#13;
negotiations and economic rehabilitation and grievance committees and field-&#13;
based officers (para. 2.28); (b) provision of entitlements to economic&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance grants for specific categories of project&#13;
affected persons (PAPs) (para. 2.29); (c) assistance to PAPs provided by NGOs&#13;
for purchase of productive assets for self employment or for other income-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
generating activities, to restore PAPs to their original economic status or&#13;
better (para. 2.29); and (d) facilitating access, through NGO's assistance,&#13;
to existing government poverty alleviation programs and income generating&#13;
schemes (para. 2.29).&#13;
2.28 To implement the WRCP's LAER program and to establish permanent&#13;
capability for future state needs in the water sector, a LAER Office has been&#13;
established in WRO headed by a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS)&#13;
officer. The LAERO will be directly responsible for implementation and&#13;
monitoring of the Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plan and&#13;
its scheme-level LAERAPs, and is also be the secretariat of a state level&#13;
Coordinating Committee comprising the Secretaries WRO (Chairman), Land&#13;
Administration, Finance, Rural Development, WRO EIC and the District&#13;
Collectors where LAER is involved. At district levels, Negotiation Committees&#13;
and Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance Committees would be established to&#13;
ensure district level coordination. For each LAER site, an NGO will be&#13;
contracted by LAERO to undertake primary responsibility for implementing the&#13;
economic rehabilitation program and to represent the interests of PAPs (rights&#13;
and entitlements), organize community participation and handle women's needs,&#13;
and facilitate access to ongoing Government development schemes (criteria for&#13;
NGO selection are at Annex 18). A full-time WRO official has also been&#13;
delegated at each site to provide hands-on WRO assistance (Implementation&#13;
Schedule and Organization Chart at Annex 9, Attachments 2 and 3).&#13;
2.29 Agreed criteria for eligibility and specific details for compensation&#13;
and rehabilitation packages are described at Annex 9. They include definition&#13;
of PAPs to include landless PAPs (encroachers, sharecroppers and tenant&#13;
farmers), and the use of negotiated purchase. This provides PAPs (personally&#13;
or through an NGO representing the PAP's interest) the option to request&#13;
negotiated settlement with a Negotiation Committee, a procedure widely used in&#13;
India and found to provide higher remuneration than the rates determined by&#13;
assessed market value. Particular emphasis will be placed under the LAERAPs&#13;
on economic rehabilitation. A first option available to marginal farmers with&#13;
incomes below the poverty line would be provision of productively comparable&#13;
land-for-land with assistance by the NGO. The land would be identified by the&#13;
PAPs within a well-defined geographic area near the village or in the command&#13;
area within a specific time frame. The terms of replacement would be on an&#13;
equal basis of one acre of dryland lost to one acre of replacement dryland, or&#13;
one-half acre of replacement irrigated land. Compensation paid for the land&#13;
lost would be applied to the cost of the replacement land and the difference&#13;
would be borne by GOTN.   As a second option, a farmer may elect to receive,&#13;
in addition to compensation for land acquisition, Rs.14,000/ha of dryland lost&#13;
(or Rs.28,000/ha for irrigated land lost) as rehabilitation grant fund (RGF)&#13;
up to a maximum of six acres of unirrigated or three acres of irrigated land&#13;
lost. The amount would be deposited by the NGO in a joint bank account with&#13;
withdrawal against signature of the PAP, the NGO and the LAERO. Withdrawals&#13;
would be linked to purchase of productive assets such as farm animals,&#13;
implements, items for self-employment, or other income-generating activities.&#13;
Both the land-for-land option and the rehabilitation grant fund (RGF) option&#13;
would be supplemented by the provision of an asset maintenance grant (AMG) of&#13;
Rs. 500/month/family applied from date of takeover of land by WRO when the&#13;
landowner loses his right to cultivate the land and ends with either&#13;
possession of replacement land or one year after establishment of the joint&#13;
bank account. The AMG would be to ensure that the PAPs have assured income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
and are not obliged to sell existing family assets pending restoration of&#13;
earning ability. Finally, additional to the above, through the district&#13;
economic rehabilitation committees and facilitated by the NGOs, existing rural&#13;
development programs (many programs exist, eg IRDP, the sericulture program,&#13;
NABARD credit, horticulture, Training of Women in Agriculture, dairy&#13;
cooperative development) would be specifically targeted to land acquisition&#13;
sites. One additional innovatory program -- fisheries culture by PAPs on the&#13;
small reservoirs created - would be specifically funded (equipment, training&#13;
and consultancy totalling US$0.2 million) under the WRCP (Annex 9, Attachment&#13;
6). The other government programs are existing and simply need targeting by&#13;
GOTN to the PAPs. The objective of the LAER program together with its&#13;
supplementary rural development activities would be to create a record of&#13;
tangible gain in welfare and earning capability for PAPs.&#13;
2.30 The LAER Action Plan would be supported by IDA funding of equipment,&#13;
vehicles, training, consultancies and incremental staff and operating costs of&#13;
the LAERO. IDA funding would also finance the NGO contracts with LAERO,&#13;
including, within the contracts, the NGO's management of the rehabilitation&#13;
grants for purchase of productive assets. GOTN would finance all land&#13;
purchase and other compensation and the asset maintenance grant fund. LAER&#13;
monitoring and special auditing provisions (para 4.08) would apply to ensure&#13;
the RGF and AMG were used for creation of productive assets (RGF) and&#13;
safeguarding of existing welfare and assets (AMG). The consultancy assistance&#13;
would include an annual review by an independent consultant of the status of&#13;
PAPs at all sites. Prior to negotiations GOTN: (i) completed through&#13;
Government Orders the remaining announcements on the features of the LAER&#13;
program: (a) expanded definition of PAPs to include encroachers,&#13;
sharecroppers, and tenant farmers; (b) the option for PAPs to use negotiated&#13;
purchase procedures; (c) land-for-land provisions for marginal farmers or the&#13;
option for alternative assets funded through the RGF; (d) provision to all&#13;
PAPs of the AMG; (e) the institutional structure for LAER; (f) use of NGOs&#13;
to assist implementation for economic rehabilitation, management of the RGF&#13;
and AMG and assistance to PAPs in negotiated purchase procedures; and (g)&#13;
targeting of rural development programs including the fisheries program; (ii)&#13;
announced through Government Order the head of the LAER cell with a suitably&#13;
qualified IAS officer; and (iii) completed the site-specific socio-economic&#13;
surveys and action plans. At negotiations an assurance was provided that land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation would be implemented in accordance&#13;
with a plan satisfactory to IDA. Implementation details for the LAER Action&#13;
Plan (paras 2.26 through 2.30 and Annex 9) were agreed, including details and&#13;
timing for implementation of the scheme-level LAERAPs.&#13;
D. Policy Reforms&#13;
Policv Reform Program&#13;
2.31 During project preparation, GOTN implemented a number of key actions to&#13;
provide the necessary institutional and policy framework to achieve the&#13;
project's objectives (paras 2.04 and 2.05). These included: (i) announcement&#13;
and commenced implementation of the institutional reforms comprising a&#13;
separate specialized Water Resources Organisation and creation of the state&#13;
water planning apparatus; (ii) preparation of a state water policy; (iii)&#13;
agreement on refocussed expenditure priorities; (iv) full funding of&#13;
maintenance; (v) establishment of new approaches for environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
management; (vi) agreement on revised policies and procedures for land&#13;
acquisition and establishment of the institutional structure for its&#13;
implementation; and (vii) forging of a new farmer integrated approach for&#13;
irrigation investment, O&amp;M and cost recovery. These measures will be followed&#13;
up in the implementation of the WRCP, as described in the project components&#13;
above and other features presented below. The package of policy and&#13;
institutional strengthening measures to be implemented under the WRCP was&#13;
affirmed at negotiations through submission by GOTN of a Policy Reform Program&#13;
under a Letter of Development Policy (attached as Annex 1).&#13;
State Water Policy&#13;
2.32 An early product from the WRCRC has been preparation of a State Water&#13;
Policy for Tamil Nadu (Annex 6), consistent with GOI's National Water Policy&#13;
(1987), and with the overall objectives of the Bank's policy paper, Water&#13;
Resources Management (1993) and the India Irrigation Sector Review (Report&#13;
9518-IN, 1991).  The document, prepared on the basis of a state workshop&#13;
organised by IWS in 1993 and issued by GOTN in July 1994, places Tamil Nadu as&#13;
the first of India's states to have issued a state water policy. In its&#13;
policy statement Tamil Nadu highlights water scarcity and the need for its&#13;
management as a unitary resource; by river basin, conjunctively for both&#13;
surface and groundwater, integrating environmental management, planning&#13;
holistically for all uses of water, and carefully prioritizing water&#13;
allocation to maximise productivity, with first priority to household&#13;
consumption needs. Actions highlighted include: establishment, with the new&#13;
WRCRC and IWS as principal coordinators, of a state institutional apparatus&#13;
for planning and allocating water between sectors; introduction of&#13;
legislation for regulating groundwater; improving the efficiency and&#13;
productivity of existing water infrastructure; monitoring and regulatory&#13;
measures to enhance water quality and protect against overextraction of&#13;
groundwater; preparation of flood control, drainage and drought management&#13;
plans; cost recovery based on users paying for services and periodic&#13;
adjustment of water rates; and strong emphasis on beneficiary participation&#13;
including turning over of maintenance and management of distribution systems&#13;
to users as the systems are upgraded.&#13;
Expenditure Prioritization&#13;
2.33 In line with Tamil Nadu's State Water Policy and the recommendations in&#13;
the India Irrigation Sector Review and the India, Public Expenditure Review,&#13;
the project would forge a fundamental reprioritization of public expenditures.&#13;
The new emphasis would be on intensified use and sustainability of existing&#13;
infrastructure and improved institutional performance. In its Letter of&#13;
Development Policy GOTN proposes to allocate public expenditures in the&#13;
following priority order: (i) activities supporting the reorganization and&#13;
technical strengthening of WRO; (ii) O&amp;M of existing facilities (para 2.34);&#13;
(iii) the system improvement and farmer turnover program; and (iv) viable&#13;
scheme completions. This reordering would enable turning around the past&#13;
situation where diversion of funds to new construction left insufficient funds&#13;
for maintenance and the large benefits from modernization, and would also&#13;
enable financial support to the project's institutional strengthening, water&#13;
planning and environmental management objectives. Inclusive of several small&#13;
and separately financed ongoing or expected activities of WRO (Tamil Nadu's&#13;
components under the Bank financed Dam Safety project, Cr 2241/Ln 3325, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
the proposed National Hydrology project, and the EEC financed Tanks project),&#13;
the agreed WRCP program would represent the entire state expenditure program&#13;
of WRO and would serve as an instrument to sustain the turnaround in effort&#13;
and expenditures of WRO, corresponding to the priority needs of the state. An&#13;
Annual Review process (para 4.11) and strengthened programming and budgeting,&#13;
monitoring, and investment selection criteria (Annex 15), confirmed during&#13;
negotiations, would ensure consistency with these priorities while enabling&#13;
program flexibility as sectoral needs evolve and water planning becomes&#13;
further established. The WRCP would serve to institutionalize the new water&#13;
sector expenditure priorities by creating the analytical and procedural&#13;
mechanisms required and progressively strengthening the staff and&#13;
institutional capability to implement them. Additionally, for the power&#13;
sector, GOTN provided an assurance at negotiations that it would implement a&#13;
program satisfactory to IDA for reducing subsidies provided to the Tamil Nadu&#13;
Electricity Board (TNEB) and cause TNEB to implement a program satisfactory to&#13;
the Association for improving its cost recovery and maintaining a sound&#13;
financial status.&#13;
Maintenance Funding&#13;
2.34 GOTN is committed to ensuring that the WRCP's investment in systems&#13;
improvement is accompanied by completely revamped management of operations and&#13;
maintenance and full funding of the state's future maintenance needs (Letter&#13;
of Development Policy). Funding for maintenance has been progressively&#13;
stepped up. From a state-wide average including staffing of Rs 120/ha in&#13;
1992/93, GOTN increased PWD's allowance to Rs 200/ha in 1993/94 and to Rs&#13;
265/ha in 1994/95. The 1994/95 allocation comprised an allocation to the new&#13;
WRO of Rs 150/ha in a separate budget account exclusively for works&#13;
expenditures, with the balance Rs 115/ha for staff costs. Similar procedures&#13;
were followed for GOTN's 1995/96 budget. The works expenditure allocation in&#13;
both 1994/95 and 1995/96 corresponds to WRO and Bank estimates of works&#13;
expenditure needs in the respective years, thus starting the project with full&#13;
Government expenditure on this key need (inadequate past funding for O&amp;M had&#13;
been primarily absorbed by salaries leaving little for actual field works).&#13;
To ensure the continued priority funding of maintenance in the future, an&#13;
assurance was provided at negotiations that: (a) GOTN would provide annually,&#13;
and make available in a timely manner during each fiscal year, starting April&#13;
1, 1995, to WRO the funds required for satisfactory maintenance of all WRO's&#13;
infrastructure, in order to sustain the infrastructure in full operating&#13;
order; (b) funds would continue to be allocated to a separate maintenance&#13;
works budget exempt from withdrawals for salaries and wages; and (c) WRO&#13;
would prepare and submit its annual maintenance budget estimates to GOTN and&#13;
IDA, based on detailed command-by-command estimates following an agreed&#13;
reporting, programming and budgeting and monitoring and evaluation process.&#13;
Cost Recovery (Annex 16)&#13;
2.35 Water charges to farmers (basic irrigation rate plus irrigation cesses)&#13;
amount to about Rs 200-210/ha, amongst the highest water charges in India.&#13;
This exceeds the Bank/WRO recommended expenditures on maintenance works (1994&#13;
prices) of about Rs 150/ha, and covers about 80% of all recurrent costs of WRO&#13;
including establishment. GOTN is currently reviewing water rates through its&#13;
"Water Rates Rationalization Committee", and this is expected to simplify&#13;
agricultural rates (presently unwieldy involving over 100 assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
categories depending on crop, soils and quality of service), to less than 20&#13;
rates under a new rating structure. GOTN intends to follow-up on these&#13;
initiatives through creation of a permanent annual review apparatus for&#13;
examining water charges, including charges for non-agricultural use. This is&#13;
an important need as the absence of such an apparatus has meant that Indian&#13;
states seldom examine water rates, resulting in stagnation of rates, for over&#13;
a decade in some instances. Second, and most fundamentally, the objective&#13;
over time in the agricultural sector will be to internalize revenues&#13;
collection and O&amp;M responsibilities at the level of water user associations,&#13;
and to link service fees to the quality of service. Universally in India,&#13;
farmers have resisted changes in water charges where the service is poor. An&#13;
improved service through the systems improvement component allows for change&#13;
in both farmer responsibilities and service fees accompanying the improved&#13;
performance of the service.&#13;
2.36 GOTN intends to undertake the following actions under the project&#13;
(Letter of Development Policy). First, GOTN will establish a permanent "Water&#13;
Services Charges Committee" (WSCC) comprising user as well as government&#13;
representation and reporting to the WRCRC. This would prepare an annual&#13;
status report and recommendations covering all uses of water. In the first&#13;
year, and as needed thereafter, consultant assistance would be funded under&#13;
the WRCP to prepare a state-wide computerized model for assessing service&#13;
costs and revenues of all water services by use (Annex 16). Dates advised by&#13;
GOTN at negotiations for establishing the WSCC and for preparing the&#13;
computerised model were July and December 1995 respectively. Second,&#13;
financial arrangements accompanying turnover of distributaries to farmers&#13;
after stage II improvement (para 2.12) were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Farmers would contribute Rs 250/ha to their farmer councils prior to agreement&#13;
with WRO for stage II investment. This would be placed in an interest earning&#13;
capitalization account. Farmers would use interest earnings or annual fees&#13;
collected by themselves to finance their cash costs for maintenance of&#13;
distributaries. For lining under stage II investments, farmers would also&#13;
contribute 20% of the costs of lining to their council bank account, further&#13;
capitalizing their capacity to finance their O&amp;M, and providing an internal&#13;
incentive to economize for this expensive works item to reaches where lining&#13;
is assessed to have significant benefits. Third, as described in GOTN's&#13;
Letter of Development Policy, the report of the Water Rates Rationalization&#13;
Committee and/or the 1995 report of the Water Services Charges Committee would&#13;
include analysis and recommendations related to: simplifying existing rates,&#13;
providing a mechanism for adjusting rates over time in line with service&#13;
costs, recommendations for introducing volumetric charging to established&#13;
farmer councils, recommendations for providing farmer councils the option to&#13;
collect the service fees due to government including retention of part of fees&#13;
as a collection incentive, and recommendations for introducing direct&#13;
provision of collected fees to the O&amp;M bank accounts of individual schemes.&#13;
Groundwater Manaaement&#13;
2.37 The project would also introduce planning, measurement and regulatory&#13;
mechanisms to monitor and manage the state's groundwater resources. The&#13;
WRCP's basin planning component (para 2.18) integrates conjunctive assessment&#13;
of surface and groundwater resources and would be supported by the&#13;
strengthened hydrological data collection and monitoring funded under the&#13;
proposed National Hydrology project. Under the WRCP GOTN also intends to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
establish a groundwater regulatory mechanism and supporting legislation&#13;
(Letter of Development policy). The proposed legislation, targeted in the&#13;
Letter of Development Policy to be ready for GOTN review by December 1996, is&#13;
expected to be a modification of the India Model Law and a draft report&#13;
prepared by UNDP and GOTN, making enforcement more rigorous and increasing&#13;
penalties for violations. A system of water use licence would be used, and&#13;
new groundwater abstraction would require licensing. GOTN established by&#13;
Government Order a nucleus Groundwater Regulatory Unit in WRO in September&#13;
1994. This is being followed up by preparation of a description of tasks to&#13;
be performed and preparation of a proposed set of measures (guidelines,&#13;
Government Orders in lieu of legislation, procedural improvements) that would&#13;
establish better control and monitoring of groundwater development and usage&#13;
pending legislation. The unit would also prepare and revise the proposed&#13;
legislation and be responsible for technical guidance and steerage of the&#13;
draft in the GOTN review process.&#13;
III. COST ESTIMATES. FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
Costs and Financina&#13;
3.01 Proaram and Project Investment Costs. The total cost of WRO's program&#13;
during the project implementation period is estimated at US$491.0 million,&#13;
including physical and price contingencies, with a foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$75.8 million (15%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$34.4&#13;
million. Program costs comprise the project investment costs of the WRCP,&#13;
which would be supported with IDA funding (para. 3.03), and WRO's recurrent&#13;
expenditures funded by GOTN. Project investment costs amount to US$315.6&#13;
million, including physical and price contingencies and US$22.0 million in&#13;
local taxes. Project investment costs cover: investment expenditures on&#13;
civil works for systems improvement and scheme completions; and, the costs of&#13;
equipment, facilities, and training/consultancies, for water planning,&#13;
research, institutional development, the environmental action plan, and&#13;
economic rehabilitation costs associated with land acquisition. WRO's&#13;
recurrent expenditures comprise the costs of maintenance, staff salaries, and&#13;
overheads, and amount, including contingencies, to US$175.4 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies were applied to baseline costs at the rate of 15% for equipment,&#13;
10% for civil works and vehicles and zero for consultancies and training, and&#13;
price contingencies at the rates estimated for international and domestic&#13;
inflation prior to negotiations (Annex 11).&#13;

3.03  Project Financina.  The proposed IDA Credit of US$282.9 million would&#13;
contribute to financing of the project investment costs of the WRCP.  The IDA&#13;
contribution would be equivalent to 58% of the costs of WRO's program (62%&#13;
exclusive of estimated taxes and duties) or the equivalent of 100% of the&#13;
foreign exchange and 54% of local program costs net of taxes and duties.&#13;
GOTN's contribution to project investment costs would be US$32.7 million&#13;
equivalent, and to WRO recurrent costs (100% financing by GOTN) would be&#13;
US$175.4 million making a total GOTN contribution to the costs of WRO's&#13;
program of US$208.1 million, as tabulated below.&#13;

3.04  The Credit would be made available to GOI on standard terms and&#13;
conditions and on-lent to GOTN under standard terms for developmental&#13;
assistance to the states. At negotiations an assurance was obtained that GOI&#13;
and GOTN would implement a system satisfactory to IDA for channelling the&#13;
funds required for the project to the project entities. An understanding was&#13;
also reached that GOI would release about three months anticipated project&#13;
expenditures in advance to GOTN (in accordance with the amounts established in&#13;
the Annual Action Plans, para 4.11), and that upon receipt of funds from GOI,&#13;
GOTN would transfer such funds, together with its quarterly counterpart&#13;
contributions, immediately to the project accounts of WRO. The project&#13;
completion date would be September 30, 2001 and the Closing Date of the Credit&#13;
would be March 31, 2002.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.05  Land  (US$0.7 M). Land acquisition would comprise, statewide, about 570&#13;
ha of private lands. GOTN would finance all land acquisition costs.&#13;
3.06 Civil Works (US$268.8 M). Civil works are scattered throughout the&#13;
state and are primarily for rehabilitating and modernizing existing irrigation&#13;
and drainage networks or completion of ongoing schemes, plus a few small&#13;
buildings (workshops, training and office space). Such works, carried out&#13;
throughout the life of the project over more than 65 locations, would not&#13;
attract foreign bidders due to their dispersed nature and the small size of&#13;
the individual contracts (works at each site would average only US$4.0&#13;
million, and each site would involve individual works scattered throughout the&#13;
distribution system). Therefore, these works would be procured through&#13;
national competitive bidding (NCB) or Force Account as follows:&#13;
(a)   NCB (US$259.8 M).  Works would be grouped into convenient&#13;
packages (80% over US$100,000 and above) for bidding and contracts&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of standard NCB documents and&#13;
following procedures satisfactory to the Association. Foreign&#13;
contractors would not be precluded from participation.&#13;
(b)   Force Account (US$9.0 M). Force Account would be used on small,&#13;
scattered civil works valued at US$15,000 equivalent or less, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding US$9.0 M to carry out very small works&#13;
in isolated and inaccessible locations that are not suitable for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
contracting. Force Account may also include rates and labor contracts&#13;
as appropriate. Materials required for these works valued at US$2.9 M&#13;
would be procured under national shopping.&#13;
The civil works will be executed by WRO (PWD's former irrigation wing) which&#13;
has executed, and is executing Bank-financed contracts, and is fully&#13;
conversant with Bank procurement procedures.&#13;
3.07 EauiDment, Materials and Vehicles (US$22.7 M)&#13;
(a)   EpuiDment and materials (US$17.1 M) would comprise a one-time investment&#13;
in maintenance equipment, and purchases of computers, other office equipment,&#13;
and various laboratory, teaching and field equipment. Procurement would&#13;
primarily be through international competitive bidding (ICB), which would&#13;
apply to purchases that can be bulked and is expected to amount to US$14.9 M.&#13;
Up to US$1.1 M of materials and equipment, including maintenance equipment,&#13;
available locally and easily serviced through local facilities, in contracts&#13;
valued below US$200,000 equivalent each, would be procured through NCB.&#13;
Isolated or smaller lot purchases, including in particular, immediate&#13;
requirements of equipment and materials, would be procured following national&#13;
shopping procedures in packages below US$25,000 equivalent each, up to an&#13;
aggregate total of US$1.1 M.&#13;
(b)   Vehicles (US$5.6 M) would consist of cars, four-wheel drives, vans,&#13;
trucks and motorcycles. ICB would be used for the bulk of purchases (US$4.0&#13;
M). Isolated or small lot purchases over the seven year life of the project&#13;
including immediate requirements, each contract not exceeding US$100,000,&#13;
would be procured using national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
(US$1.6 M).&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for all procurement under&#13;
ICB/NCB. For comparing foreign and local bids in ICB, the qualifying domestic&#13;
bidders would be allowed a margin of preference in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paras. 2.55 and 2.56 of the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
Under national shopping, rate contracts of the Director General, Supplies and&#13;
Disposals would be acceptable.&#13;
3.08 Technical Assistance. Training and Studies (USS22.2 M) Technical&#13;
assistance, training and studies includes local and foreign consultancies&#13;
(US$6.4 M), contracts under the Water Resources Research Fund (US$3.4 M),&#13;
contracts with NGOs for implementation assistance for the land acquisition and&#13;
economic rehabilitation component (US$1.3 M) and the farmer turnover component&#13;
(US$0.7 M), applied research and special studies by IWS, IHH, CE Plan&#13;
Formulation and Basin Managers and under the Environmental Action Plan (US$6.0&#13;
M), and costs of staff training including visits in India and overseas (US&#13;
$4.4 M). Technical Assistance would be contracted on terms and conditions in&#13;
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency", published by the Bank in&#13;
August 1981. It would comprise consultancy through a "twinning arrangement"&#13;
(para 4.03) which would provide both technical assistance and access to&#13;
training arrangements (about US$5.8 M), and a smaller (about US$0.5 M)&#13;
"supervision consultancy" (para 4.13) to assist GOTN's supervision committee,&#13;
and small individual consultancies in particular specialties or as needed.&#13;
Selection for the twinning arrangement would be based on an initial screening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
and prequalification invitation exercise conducted by WRO, followed by&#13;
invitation of detailed offers from a shorter list of 3 to 5 interested&#13;
consulting groups. Other technical assistance, training, local consultancies,&#13;
research grants and contracting to universities and NGOs would be arranged by&#13;
WRO in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.09 Incremental Staff and Operatina Costs for Land Acauisition and Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation (USS1.2 M). The Credit would not finance operating costs,&#13;
staff salaries (except LAER, see below) and maintenance which would be&#13;
financed by GOTN. To assist with build-up of the organization required for&#13;
management and implementation of the LAER program, incremental staff and&#13;
operating costs for LAER would be financed by IDA on a declining basis (US$1.0&#13;
M; para 3.13).&#13;
3.10 Review of Contracts. All contracts for civil works, goods and equipment&#13;
valued at US$200,000 and above, and all consultancy contracts valued at&#13;
US$100,000 and above (US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants) and all&#13;
single source consultancy contracts over US$100,000 equivalent, as well as the&#13;
first five contracts under each of the works, goods and consultancy categories&#13;
irrespective of the values would be subjected to prior IDA review. All other&#13;
contracts would be subject to random post review in the field by visiting&#13;
missions. This will result in about 50% of the project procurement being&#13;
subject to prior review. WRO is experienced with Bank procurement, both under&#13;
the ongoing NWMP project and the recently closed Periyar Vaigai project, and a&#13;
higher level of formal reviews by IDA would not have a significant impact on&#13;
procurement quality.&#13;
3.11 Procurement Manaaement. The following procedures for the WRCP's&#13;
procurement management were agreed at negotiations:&#13;
(i) except where may be specifically agreed by IDA, prequalification&#13;
procedures would not be used;&#13;
(ii) as a minimum, all bid invitations would be advertised in newspapers with&#13;
national circulation and shall contain in summary form the post-qualification&#13;
requirements. Bid documents shall be provided promptly upon request, upon&#13;
payment of the prescribed fee, and shall be sent by mail upon request;&#13;
(iii) Bids shall be evaluated, contract award approvals sought and granted&#13;
(including that of IDA, where required) and contracts signed, all within the&#13;
bid validity period, and a justification for any exceptions shall be forwarded&#13;
to IDA;&#13;
(iv) At time of bid opening, WRO would appoint (or retain) a suitably&#13;
qualified individual (the Evaluator) to prepare a signed and dated Bid&#13;
Evaluation Report (BER), following a format and content acceptable to IDA.&#13;
The BER will be prepared as expeditiously as practicable;&#13;
(v) A Contract Award Committee (CAC) for the WRCP, with constitution&#13;
acceptable to IDA, would be authorised to recommend the award of the contract&#13;
(subject where required to approval by IDA prior to award, para 3.10). The&#13;
Bid Evaluation Report shall be submitted to the CAC within seven working days&#13;
of its completion. The CAC members would sign a dated minutes of their&#13;
proceedings and decisions which would be kept on file, for possible review by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
IDA and, where required, also furnished promptly to IDA for approval along&#13;
with the BER. (The CAC was established by Government Order in October 1994&#13;
and comprises the Secretary PWD/WRO, Secretary Finance and EIC, WRO.); and&#13;
(vi) WRO's quarterly reports (para 4.10) would contain summarized procurement&#13;
data including for each contract the dates of bid invitation, receipt,&#13;
evaluation, approval and signing, and the names of contractors bidding, offer&#13;
prices and firm awarded the contract.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.13 The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed against:&#13;
(a)   90% of expenditures on civil works;&#13;
(b)   100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local ex-factory costs or&#13;
80% of other local costs of equipment, vehicles and materials;&#13;
(c)   100% of expenditures on consultants'  (including NGOs') services,&#13;
training and studies; and&#13;
(d)   for the land acquisition and economic rehabilitation component,&#13;
90% of incremental staff salaries and allowances and operating&#13;
costs covering the period to March 31, 1997 (to end PY2), 80%&#13;
through March 31, 1998 (PY3), 60% through March 31, 1999 (PY4),&#13;
40% through March 31, 2000 (PY5) and zero for PY6.&#13;
3.14 Disbursements against civil works, equipment, vehicles and materials&#13;
contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent and consultancy and training&#13;
contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be fully documented (for individual&#13;
consultants the limit would be US$50,000 equivalent). For all other&#13;
expenditures, disbursement could be against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
Supporting documents for SOEs would not be submitted to IDA, but would be&#13;
retained by GOTN and made available to IDA staff during supervision (Annex 12&#13;
for Schedule of Disbursements). Disbursements against the NGO contracts for&#13;
LAER would exclude the maintenance grants (para 2.30) to be funded by&#13;
Government (US$0.4 million).&#13;
Retroactive Financing and SDecial Account&#13;
3.15 WRO has already commenced field activities related to the WRCP to&#13;
expedite project start-up. To reimburse GOTN for such expenditures,&#13;
retroactive financing would be applied to all eligible expenditures incurred&#13;
from July 1, 1994 provided that procurement procedures acceptable to IDA were&#13;
followed. Additionally, for completing the remaining (7%) balance works for&#13;
the link canal under the former Periyar Vaigai Irrigation II project, the&#13;
earlier date of November 1, 1993 would be applied (up to US$1.5 million).&#13;
Since December 1993, and earlier for the link canal, WRO has used Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines. The additional guidelines at para 3.11 would apply&#13;
from Credit signature. The total amount of retroactive financing, including&#13;
the link canal, would amount to up to US$11 million or about 4% of the Credit.&#13;
To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a Special Account in US dollars would be established in the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India with an authorised allocation of US$10 million. This&#13;
deposit is based on estimates of the project's financing needs and projected&#13;
IDA disbursements (Annexes 11 and 12).&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.16 Project accounts, maintained by WRO, would identify all project&#13;
transactions on an ongoing basis, including contributions from GOTN, GOI and&#13;
the Credit. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOI and GOTN that:&#13;
(i) project accounts, including the Special Account, would be maintained and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards consistently&#13;
applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA; and (ii)&#13;
certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with the&#13;
auditors report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be&#13;
submitted to IDA not later than nine months after the close of each GOTN&#13;
fiscal year (April 1 to March 31).&#13;
IV.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;

4.01         The project would be implemented by Tamil Nadu's Water Resources&#13;
Organization (WRO). As the project and its contributing IDA and state funds&#13;
are supporting the overall program of WRO, project years, project monitoring&#13;
and physical and financial planning fit in with the GOTN fiscal year (April 1&#13;
to March 31). Project management would be the responsibility of the Engineer-&#13;
in-Chief, WRO (para 2.24) under the guidance of the Secretary PWD/WRO. WRO's&#13;
new organizational structure (para 2.25) is at Annex 2. Implementation&#13;
arrangements are in the Implementation and Supervision Plan at Annex 13. This&#13;
includes an Implementation Schedule, Implementation Responsibilities, IDA&#13;
Supervision Schedule, and Development Indicators at Attachments 1, 2, 3 and 4&#13;
respectively.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
4.02        The extensive reorganization and institutional strengthening to be&#13;
undertaken under the project would require substantial training and technical&#13;
assistance throughout the new WRO. Training and consultancy needs have been&#13;
prepared for each management unit and are detailed in their respective cost&#13;
tables. Each CE would be responsible for managing the specific training and&#13;
consultancy relevant to his management unit, but would receive administrative&#13;
support from a Training and Technical Assistance officer in the EIC's office.&#13;
Overall coordination and identification of training opportunities would be&#13;
provided by the CE, IMTI. The EIC would provide general guidance and balance&#13;
needs between WRO units. Training would focus on strengthening skills in all&#13;
engineering areas including operations and maintenance, water planning,&#13;
environmental management, design and construction, and on supporting skill&#13;
development associated with technologies or management techniques relatively&#13;
new to WRO such as financial management, programming and budgeting, critical&#13;
path scheduling, computerization, computer aided design, remote sensing and&#13;
management information systems. For consultancies, in order that know-how is&#13;
transferred to WRO staff, consultant assistance would be linked in all cases&#13;
to staff training through association of staff with consultant assignments and&#13;
interlinked formal training as practicable. National and international study&#13;
tours and temporary assignments would also be used to provide first-hand&#13;
exposure to new technologies and management techniques.&#13;
4.03        Consultancy arrangements would include small consultancies with&#13;
individuals or firms, but would be backstopped throughout the project period&#13;
with a "twinning arrangement" with an experienced consultancy group. All&#13;
consultancy selection would follow Bank guidelines. The twinning arrangement&#13;
is expected to be a consortium of several firms or specialist institutions,&#13;
combining a mix of international and local firms. The central skill areas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
seldom found in one firm or agency, would likely comprise all aspects of&#13;
irrigation engineering, water planning, and environmental management, and&#13;
hands-on irrigation agency management, particularly in O&amp;M, general management&#13;
techniques and beneficiary participation. One of the firms or agencies would&#13;
be the lead partner and have overall responsibility for mobilizing the&#13;
consultancy and training support required. The contract would provide a basic&#13;
expertise and training input annually, including some core senior staff&#13;
providing continuity of visits, and access to other specializations and&#13;
training on an "as needed" basis. Selection would be through an initial pre-&#13;
qualification of interested firms, which would advise of any intended&#13;
partners, followed by short listing by WRO of 3 to 5 firms or groups of firms&#13;
for submission of detailed offers. A contract over the project period would&#13;
be agreed at the outset, with flexibility for annual variations based on an&#13;
annual review of consultancy and related training needs between WRO and the&#13;
consortium in consultation with GOTN and IDA. The above procedures would&#13;
provide the expertise required while limiting constraints frequently found in&#13;
India of obtaining individual clearances, especially for consultants and&#13;
training requiring foreign exchange. At negotiations, the above consultancy&#13;
and training objectives were confirmed. Suitably qualified and experienced&#13;
NGOs would be recruited for implementation of the LAERAPs (para 4.08), and as&#13;
community organizers for farmer participation and turnover (para 4.04). At&#13;
negotiations an assurance was obtained that any NGOs contracted under the&#13;
project would be selected according to criteria (Annex 18) agreed with IDA.&#13;
Manaaement of Farmer Organization  (Annex 4)&#13;
4.04        Special organizational needs are posed by the farmer participation&#13;
and turnover program, already being piloted but recognized by WRO as requiring&#13;
a major staff focus supported by NGOs and consultants for its success on a&#13;
wider scale. Organization and staff and farmer training for this is&#13;
intensively underway with assistance of a core team of WRO staff and a&#13;
consultant advisor. Farmer Organization (FO) would be implemented integrally&#13;
with system improvements and would come under the CE O&amp;M for technical support&#13;
and monitoring, and under the respective basin managers and scheme level&#13;
executive engineers for field implementation. At both CE, O&amp;M and basin&#13;
manager levels, a deputy CE will be charged with supervising the FO program.&#13;
The work program of IMTI has been adjusted to focus principally on training&#13;
for staff and farmers related to the farmer participation and system&#13;
improvement program (Annex 4, Attachment D). All O&amp;M staff would receive&#13;
"appreciation" training, with more intensive training and consultancy support&#13;
for specialized FO teams and for the office bearers in farmer councils. About&#13;
15 FO teams would be deployed throughout the project period, each comprising 3&#13;
WRO staff and two community organizers (a man and a woman) and handling about&#13;
5000 ha per cycle (about 1 1/2 years per cycle typically, followed by less&#13;
intensive FO support to established water user associations). An&#13;
Institutional Advisor would supervise 2 to 3 FO teams. A consultant Senior&#13;
Institutional Advisor, would supervise the entire FO effort from the CE, O&amp;M's&#13;
office. The Community Organizers and Institutional Advisors would be&#13;
recruited through local NGOs with practical field experience. The FO program&#13;
includes national and international consultancy support and provisions for&#13;
national and international training and study tours.&#13;
4.05        The farmer organization and turnover program would be intensively&#13;
monitored and evaluated throughout the WRCP period, incorporating lessons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
learned from experience. This would commence with a targeted survey in PYI to&#13;
assess the state of affairs on specific criteria and to refine M&amp;E criteria to&#13;
ensure meaningful qualitative indicators of impact (Annex 4, Attachment E). A&#13;
special review of the farmer oraanization and turnover prooram by independent&#13;
consultants would be undertaken at the end of PY2, sufficiently early in&#13;
project implementation to enable timely adjustment as needed. The WRCP's&#13;
annual reviews (para 4.11) would also have a special section on this&#13;
component. The above arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Management of Land Acauisition and Economic Rehabilitation (Annex 9)&#13;
4.06        The Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation (LAER) Cell&#13;
reporting directly to the Secretary WRO would be responsible for planning,&#13;
coordinating, monitoring and evaluating all land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation of project affected persons (PAPs) under the project. It would&#13;
also serve as the secretariat for a state level coordinating committee for&#13;
LAER under the WRCP. It would be responsible for contracting with NGOs to&#13;
carry out Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (ERAPs) for each subproject,&#13;
overseeing their work, and providing approval for the joint accounts to be&#13;
established under the ERAPs. The LAER Cell would be provided with adequate&#13;
funding to carry out its mandate.&#13;
4.07        At the district level the LAER Cell would be supported by a&#13;
Negotiations Committee and an Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance Committee&#13;
(ERGC). The Negotiations Committees have been provided the authority to&#13;
conduct negotiations with the landowners to establish a full and fair&#13;
valuation of land to be acquired for the project. The ERGCs would be&#13;
responsible for grievance resolutions and for monitoring the implementation of&#13;
the ERAPs.&#13;
4.08        The LAER Cell would contract one NGO per subproject to assist in&#13;
the implementation of ERAPs. Funds for the Rehabilitation Grants would be&#13;
deposited in joint NGO/PAP accounts established by the LAER Cell. The NGO&#13;
would provide assistance to each PAP in preparing and implementing individual&#13;
economic rehabilitation plans. The NGO would be responsible for certifying&#13;
that the Grants had been used for the purchase of productive assets or income&#13;
generating schemes, and would be subject to special monitoring procedures by&#13;
LAERO and annual auditing consistent with accepted standards. Approval to&#13;
withdraw funds from the joint account would be on the basis of three&#13;
signatures: LAER Officer, the NGO and the PAP. These arrangements and other&#13;
features at paras 2.26 to 2.30 and Annex 9 were confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.09        WRO's Program and Budgeting unit (P&amp;B), reporting to the EIC,&#13;
would be responsible for developing and operating a system of physical and&#13;
financial reporting to track project progress, maintaining a computerized&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) and coordinating preparation of annual&#13;
work programs and budgets.  Each management unit would be responsible for&#13;
providing P&amp;B with required information and estimates. A project&#13;
Implementation Schedule and Key Project Performance Indicators are provided at&#13;
Annex 13, Attachments 1 and 4.  A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) unit,&#13;
reporting to the EIC, would use P&amp;B and other data to report on the progress&#13;
and benefits of the project. Indicators monitored would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
implementation of the institutional strengthening, staff training and&#13;
development, physical progress and quality/capacity improvement by all units,&#13;
delivery of water and improved services, quality of annual maintenance, farmer&#13;
participation and turnover, cost recovery, agricultural growth and crop&#13;
diversification. The remote sensing capability to be built up under the WRCP&#13;
in IWS would be one of the tools used to monitor water management and some&#13;
crop data. In addition to regular data sources from line units, M&amp;E would use&#13;
consultant surveys as needed. This would include a Baseline Survey (TOR at&#13;
Annex 10) covering agricultural data, household income and socio-economic&#13;
data, existing irrigation performance and water use undertaken by consultants&#13;
in 1995 as a basis for future monitoring and performance evaluation. At&#13;
negotiations, the TOR for the baseline survey and implementation details,&#13;
including agreement on its completion by December 31, 1995, was confirmed.&#13;
Additional independent monitoring and evaluation, or assessments on specialist&#13;
aspects of project performance and impact would be available from independent&#13;
agencies funded under the project's research fund (para 2.22).&#13;
Project Reviews and Reporting&#13;
4.10        WRO would be responsible for the internal reporting requirements&#13;
of the State and GOI (Annex 13 paras 19 to 29). This would take the form of&#13;
short quarterly progress reports and a comprehensive Annual Review. Action&#13;
Plan and Budaet (ARAPB), both prepared by the P&amp;B unit under the EIC's&#13;
guidance. The auarterlv progress reports (Attachment 6 of Annex 13) would&#13;
comprise submissions by each implementation unit in WRO which would quantify&#13;
and compare progress with the SAR and the previous ARAPB, discuss shortfalls,&#13;
and propose measures to resolve any problems. An overview with summarized&#13;
data and a listing of decisions taken or recommended, based on each unit's&#13;
submission, would be prepared by the EIC's office. This would include a&#13;
commentary on the status of decisions/actions outstanding from the last&#13;
quarterly report, and a review of outstanding decisions related to any&#13;
recommendations by GOTN, GOI or IDA. The reports would be presented to the&#13;
Secretary WRO and copied to relevant state officials, GOI and IDA.&#13;
4.11        The ARAPB would be the main vehicle for annually taking stock of&#13;
project performance and future needs, for adjusting WRO's program as needed,&#13;
for budgeting by GOTN of WRO's Plan and non-Plan expenditures, and for review&#13;
and supervision by GOTN, GOI and IDA. For WRO it would provide annual&#13;
opportunity to assess its overall program, to propose adjustments as needed&#13;
and to make a consolidated plan and justification for its forthcoming&#13;
financing needs. The ARAPB would review for each component and responsible&#13;
unit the past year's achievements in terms of expenditure and physical targets&#13;
by quarter, and include a justified work program and proposed expenditure&#13;
budget for the forthcoming year. This would include: (i) description of each&#13;
year's works, schedule of activities, staffing requirements and distribution&#13;
of responsibilities; (ii) proposed expenditures compared with previous year's&#13;
expenditures; (iii) details on major civil works contracts exceeding&#13;
US$200,000 and for ICB for goods; and (iv) financing plan and source of&#13;
funds; plus special sections covering, (v) review of implementation progress&#13;
related to the institutional strengthening and policy reforms under the&#13;
project; (vi) detailed review and proposal of maintenance needs and&#13;
corresponding non-Plan expenditure requirements (para 2.34); (vii) the farmer&#13;
participation and turnover program; and (viii) progress of state water&#13;
planning under WRCRC and IWS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
4.12       At negotiations, the above project review and reporting&#13;
arrangements were confirmed including specific assurances related to the&#13;
following: (i) a draft ARAPB for the forthcoming GOTN fiscal year would be&#13;
submitted to IDA for review and comment by December 31 each year, commencing&#13;
December 1995. The GOTN approved ARAPB, taking account of IDA comments, would&#13;
subsequently be forwarded to IDA by March 31, and WRO would subsequently&#13;
implement the agreed action plan, including the timely provision of the&#13;
approved budget funds, in a manner satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) not later&#13;
than December 31,1997, GOTN would carry out jointly with GOI and IDA, a&#13;
detailed mid-term review of project progress (and possible need for&#13;
adjustments to components, implementation arrangements and policy reforms),&#13;
and thereafter implement its recommendations.&#13;
Supervision (Annex 13)&#13;
4.13        By integrating creation of management information and programming&#13;
and budgeting in the WRCP, the capabilities of WRO to program and monitor its&#13;
activities will be strengthened. The reporting arrangements above are also&#13;
designed to facilitate monitoring by GOTN, GOI and IDA, and to provide a&#13;
mechanism for integrating adjustments in quarterly and annual action programs.&#13;
IDA support (Supervision Schedule at Annex 13, Attachment 3) would typically&#13;
comprise a main supervision mission annually at time of ARAPB review,&#13;
supplemented by a shorter mid-year visit, and correspondence and clearances as&#13;
needed. In view of the institutional and technical challenges to be&#13;
undertaken under the project, GOTN intends to undertake a close monitoring and&#13;
supervision role itself, assisted by consultants. This would be through a&#13;
state-level "Supervision Committee" formed in April 1995 chaired by the&#13;
Secretary WRO and including the Finance Department, Land Development&#13;
Commissioner, State Planning Commission, two experienced invited members&#13;
(former WRO, other Government agency or business community/NGO) and the EIC.&#13;
The committee would meet at least quarterly to review WRO's quarterly reports.&#13;
The committee would employ a "Supervision Consultant" through a contract with&#13;
a national consultancy firm. The supervision consultants would assist the&#13;
committee, including two visits annually, overlapping with IDA supervision&#13;
visits, and provide extra support as requested by the Committee. Costs of the&#13;
consultancy would be reimbursable under the Credit. Consultant reports would&#13;
be to the Supervision Committee, and also made available to 0OI and IDA.&#13;
These arrangements were confirmed at negotiations and an assurance provided&#13;
that the supervision committee would be maintained for the duration of the&#13;
project.&#13;
V.   BENEFITS.  JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
5.01         The project would generate substantial and wide reaching&#13;
benefits. These range from the project's broader impact resulting from multi-&#13;
sectoral water planning, environmental management of water resources,&#13;
institutional strengthening, beneficiary participation, and refocusing of&#13;
public expenditures (para 5.04), to the specifically quantifiable impacts of&#13;
the project's two main investment components: the improvement of the existing&#13;
irrigation schemes, and the investments in scheme completions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.02        System ImDrovement and Farmer Turnover.  About 660,000 ha of&#13;
irrigated land (50% of the state's area under surface irrigation), comprising&#13;
some 0.7 million farm families (about 3.9 million persons), would benefit from&#13;
the WRCP's system improvement program.  Improved reliability of water&#13;
supplies, including improved timing of delivery relative to crop needs, would&#13;
benefit most farmers, with larger benefits for tail-end farmers who to date&#13;
often receive partial or no water. About 107,000 ha of land would change from&#13;
partial to full irrigation, and an additional 34,000 ha, presently not&#13;
receiving any water, would receive irrigation. Overall, the annual value of&#13;
crop output would increase by Rs 1,040 million (US$33 million), including a&#13;
170,000 t/annum increase in food grain production. Benefits by family would&#13;
vary depending on the existing status of irrigation in the command and their&#13;
position in the command. A typical family with one hectare presently&#13;
receiving unreliable irrigation would increase agricultural net income by Rs&#13;
2,100/ha. For farmers currently receiving no or very incomplete irrigation,&#13;
incomes would increase by an average of Rs 9,800/ha.&#13;
5.03        Scheme ComDletions.  The nine selected scheme completions would&#13;
augment the state's irrigated area by 31,000 ha and produce an incremental&#13;
agricultural output valued at Rs 380 million (US$12 million). Some 26,000&#13;
farm families would directly benefit from the investment, experiencing typical&#13;
income improvements of Rs 12,600/ha.&#13;
5.04        Non-auantifiable Benefits.  Substantial benefits would stem from&#13;
the project's institution strengthening and water planning activities, and&#13;
associated measures to create a sustainable and client oriented water service.&#13;
First, under the WRCP, Tamil Nadu will create a modern water resources agency&#13;
and supporting policy and institutional mechanisms to plan and manage water&#13;
from a multi-sectoral and environmentally-responsive perspective. The&#13;
scarcity of water resources in Tamil Nadu makes optimum water usage critical&#13;
to economic development. This cross-sectoral need is important to the&#13;
sustainability of development and the environment. Second, the project would&#13;
forge revised roles for Government and the private sector. The past&#13;
government-dominated approach would adjust to allow for active participation&#13;
of beneficiaries including progressive turnover of facility operations and&#13;
maintenance functions to farmers. The desired outcome is of a sustainable&#13;
infrastructure managed and maintained by local communities, and a client&#13;
responsive planning and investment machinery.  Cost recovery would be linked&#13;
with the new client approach, internalized and collected by farmers at lower&#13;
levels in the systems, and with annual reviews related to service costs&#13;
replacing the past politically-influenced process. Third, the WRCP&#13;
preparation has enabled a complete rethink of irrigation sector expenditure&#13;
priorities and their subsequent reflection in WRO's expenditure program. Full&#13;
funding of maintenance is to be the first priority, rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of existing infrastructure the second priority, and viable&#13;
completions of existing schemes the third. A viable state expenditure&#13;
program, corresponding to the identified priorities, is reflected in the&#13;
project's ERR below. The institutional and financial planning measures&#13;
established under the WRCP would enable continuity of sound expenditure&#13;
planning and sub-project selection beyond the project completion date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
5.05        Assumvtions.  Economic rates of return have been estimated for&#13;
each of the project's investment components: the system improvement and&#13;
farmer turnover component (55% of project investment costs), and the scheme&#13;
completions component (29% of costs). The following assumptions are made:&#13;
all costs and benefits are in constant March 1994 prices expressed net of&#13;
identifiable taxes; physical contingencies are as in the project cost&#13;
estimates at para 3.01; reference prices for main crops and fertilizer are&#13;
based on estimated world reference prices adjusted to Tamil Nadu farmgate&#13;
values; costs and benefits are adjusted by the standard conversion factor&#13;
used in India of 0.9; project benefit and cost streams are extended over 30&#13;
years; benefits are derived from incremental crop production; the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital is 12%; and the project implementation period is&#13;
7 years. Assumptions, calculations used and detailed results are at Annex 14.&#13;
5.06        ERR and Sensitivity Analysis.  The economic rate of return for the&#13;
project is calculated as the combined ERR of the two investment components&#13;
(80% of project costs) and is estimated to be 17%. The ERR for the&#13;
modernization, rehabilitation and farmer turnover component is 19%, and that&#13;
of the scheme completions component is 15%. The selection criterion for&#13;
individual sub-projects was a rate of return of not less than 12% (Annexes 14&#13;
and 15). Benefits have not been quantified for the project's water planning&#13;
and environmental action plan, nor for institutional improvement expenditures&#13;
not directly related to the two production components. If the costs of these&#13;
items (20% of project costs) are included, but without ascribing benefits, the&#13;
rate of return would be 13%.&#13;
5.07        Overall, the project is robust to significant changes in costs and&#13;
benefits: benefits would need to fall by 30% or costs increase by 43% for the&#13;
ERR to fall to 12% (i.e. with a net present value of zero). Significant&#13;
departures from estimated costs and benefits are unlikely as costs are based&#13;
on actual field experience under PWD's construction program and the National&#13;
Water Management Project, and estimated benefits are realistic, having been&#13;
based on yield data measured by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and FAOCP&#13;
field visits. Sensitivity tests also assess the impact of shortfalls of&#13;
various kinds (paras. 5.08 to 5.10). For instance: if benefits lagged by two&#13;
years as a result perhaps of insufficient monitoring of implementation&#13;
activities, the project's overall rate of return would be 13%; if resources&#13;
for maintenance were seriously deficient after project completion, the overall&#13;
ERR would be 13%; or, if independence of farmer organizations is&#13;
substantially below expectations, the ERR would be 14%.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
5.08        The first risk relates to the project's objectives to implement a&#13;
fundamental change in water resources management, covering issues from policy&#13;
and institutional changes to adjustment in expenditure priorities and field&#13;
activities. WRO will be continually challenged as it implements the project&#13;
and progressively adjusts and upgrades its skills to become a specialized&#13;
state water agency. Commitment of WRO, and strong political will within Tamil&#13;
Nadu to support WRO and its objectives, will be essential for the success of&#13;
the project. Recognizing this, preparation of the project has centered on&#13;
creating before project start-up, the basic institutional and policy features&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
important to project success. GOTN has undertaken a large number of decisions&#13;
and actions to this effect during 1993 and 1994/95, and formalized these in&#13;
official Government Orders. A number of actions, such as the preparation of&#13;
the state water policy, the institutional reorganization and the preparation&#13;
of the farmer participation component, have entailed extensive discussion&#13;
within Tamil Nadu involving many Government agencies, NGOs and farmers. As a&#13;
result, the actions taken and consensus that has been built to achieve those&#13;
actions will help launch the project with a sound base toward successful&#13;
implementation. The progress to date provides confidence that the Government&#13;
will continue (as it must do to ensure project success) to undertake the tough&#13;
but necessary measures to deepen the reform process. While it is recognized&#13;
that full achievement of the reforms is a desired outcome, the project would&#13;
still be considered a success if significant achievement (though less than&#13;
complete) is realized. This notwithstanding, risk of shortfall has been&#13;
reduced through a variety of monitoring and incentive mechanisms specifically&#13;
built into the project. Over time, such project measures will be reinforced&#13;
and significantly overtaken in importance as the client orientation of the&#13;
project takes hold and users become important as operators of irrigation and&#13;
as parties in state and basin water planning.&#13;
5.09         The second risk relates to the systems improvement and farmer&#13;
turnover component. Technical aspects have been implemented and proven on a&#13;
large scale - 150,000 ha - under NWMP, and implementation of the WRCP's larger&#13;
program is manageable due to the experience acquired under NWMP. The farmer&#13;
organization aspect is, however, innovatory and unique in India on this scale.&#13;
The intensive preparation effort and piloting of this component during the&#13;
past two years will need a continued drive throughout the project period. As&#13;
with the general institutional reform component above, continued levels of&#13;
commitment during project implementation that yield significant but incomplete&#13;
achievement of these institutional objectives would still represent successful&#13;
attainment of project objectives. To lessen risks of shortfall and to sustain&#13;
the efforts already being undertaken by the Government, intensive consultancy&#13;
and training support have been built into this program, which will also&#13;
mobilize community organizers from local NGOs to provide the intensive&#13;
assistance required. The project also contains provisions for special&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the program during implementation, and a detailed&#13;
review of the farmer organization component in PY2, so as to allow for early&#13;
adjustments as needed based on the initial experience acquired.&#13;
5.10        A third risk, relating to general implementation capacity of WRO,&#13;
would be reduced by the management improvements integral to project objectives&#13;
under the institutional strengthening of WRO. Supplemented by special&#13;
measures to improve procurement (para 3.11), timely implementation of the&#13;
project's two main components is expected, since WRO (as the former irrigation&#13;
wing of PWD) has proven capability in management of works where procurement&#13;
and financial constraints have been resolved.&#13;
5.11        Proaram Obiective Cateaories.  The project is supportive of the&#13;
Bank's anti-poverty strategy. The project would improve the incomes and&#13;
living standards of small and marginal farmers - estimated to form some 70% of&#13;
beneficiaries - through improved and equitable distribution of water for&#13;
irrigation and domestic use. Employment opportunities for landless families&#13;
would also be substantially enhanced as labor needs are closely linked to crop&#13;
intensification and yields. For the urban poor, the project's planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
component would be important for future bulk water supply needs. The&#13;
project's emphasis on beneficiary participation would help ensure that&#13;
beneficiary needs are integrated in all decisions, efficiency is improved and&#13;
service quality sustained and affordable. Women, often under-represented in&#13;
irrigation management and also the primary users of domestic water, would&#13;
receive special client emphasis. To this effect, half of the village&#13;
