including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;

finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;

exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;

change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments&#13;
