TO:      The President, International Development Association&#13;
Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Additional Financing of the Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting,&#13;
and Hillside Irrigation Project to the Republic of Rwanda&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of the&#13;
International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its recommendation pursuant to&#13;
said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to the Republic of Rwanda an additional&#13;
credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 22,800,000. The purpose of said additional credit is to provide&#13;
additional funds to supplement the financial assistance furnished by the Association under the Financing&#13;
Agreement (Credit Number 4674-RW), dated February 8, 2010, between the Republic of Rwanda and the&#13;
Association.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such an additional&#13;
financing, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the additional financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of such&#13;
additional financing are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth&#13;
in Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic&#13;
development of the Republic of Rwanda and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the&#13;
Republic of Rwanda.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project continues to merit financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such additional assistance.&#13;
