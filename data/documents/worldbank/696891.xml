Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agencies:          BPPI, BPPT and LIPI&#13;
Beneficiaries:      BPPI, BPPT and LIPI&#13;
Amount:             US$47.0 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:              Repayable in 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years,&#13;
at the standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:&#13;
Project Objectives: The objective of the project is to enhance&#13;
the competitiveness of Indonesian industry, particularly of small&#13;
and medium industries (SMIs), by: (a) providing public and&#13;
private technology support services; (b) facilitating the access&#13;
to  public  and  private  technology  service  providers;&#13;
(c) strengthening public technology support institutions; and&#13;
(d) improving the formulation and coordination of industrial&#13;
technology policies.&#13;
Project Description: The project would: (a) strengthen&#13;
Indonesia's system of industrial metrology, standards, testing&#13;
and quality (MSTQ) support services; (b) support the diffusion&#13;
of good technology practices through a cost-sharing matching&#13;
grant fund to finance the competitive provision of technology&#13;
upgrading services to SMIs by both public and private&#13;
technology suppliers; (c) provide assistance for reorienting the&#13;
public research and development labs towards supporting more&#13;
effective technology development in private industry, especially&#13;
SMIs; and (d) strengthen the capacity to formulate and&#13;
coordinate technology and industrial strategies, policies and&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
and Risks:&#13;
Project Benefits: The Country Assistance Strategy emphasizes&#13;
the importance of improving Indonesia's competitiveness and the&#13;
need for a shift toward a productivity based economy and the&#13;
complimentary private provision of supporting infrastructure&#13;
services. The proposed project addresses each of these areas&#13;
through its support for more effective provision of technology&#13;
services to help improve the competitiveness of Indonesian&#13;
industry.  The  package  of policy  reforms,  institutional&#13;
strengthening and capacity building is expected to help enhance&#13;
the competitiveness of Indonesia's SMI manufacturing sector,&#13;
the target group of the project. While the benefits of the actions&#13;
supported under the project do not lend themselves to precise&#13;
quantitative analysis, there is ample evidence from the high&#13;
performing East Asian countries that effective technology&#13;
support services yield high economic and financial returns for&#13;
manufacturing companies through reduced product defects, faster&#13;
manufacturing turnaround times, lower inventories, higher&#13;
productivity, increased domestic and export sales and new&#13;
product designs. These benefits are multiples of the cost of the&#13;
corresponding services and substantially increase the returns on&#13;
SMIs' existing investments in plant, equipment and human&#13;
capital. A least-cost approach to project design was taken to&#13;
increase the effectiveness and utilization of the existing&#13;
technology service infrastructure primarily through changes in&#13;
incentives and management practices, accountability, and&#13;
systems; and restructuring, rather than through investments in&#13;
additional equipment. The project will lead to increased private&#13;
provision   of   technology   services   and   increasing&#13;
commercialization and result orientation of public industrial&#13;
technology services, with greater accountability and transparency&#13;
in public resource use.&#13;
Project Risks:   The reorientation of the public technology&#13;
infrastructure towards commercial use and result-oriented&#13;
management, the effective coordination of Government policies&#13;
for industry and science and technology and the development of&#13;
competent private service providers may be slower than&#13;
envisaged. Similarly, the SMI sector may be slow in accessing&#13;
the new services being offered. To help minimize these risks,&#13;
project preparation was extended to: (a) help build consensus&#13;
within government on the need for and ways to achieve this&#13;
strategic reorientation of public support for technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
development, including drawing on best practices from other&#13;
countries' experiences; (b) develop a new policy framework that&#13;
will drive the public technology support institutions (PTSIs) to&#13;
commercialize their research and development and require from&#13;
them greater accountability for achieving measurable results, and&#13;
increased transparency and better management of the operations&#13;
of the PTSIs; (c) provide the PTSIs under the project an&#13;
opportunity to develop sound business plans for their&#13;
commercialization based on assessments of market demands and&#13;
build a pipeline of technology projects with private industry; and&#13;
(d) obtain the participation of private industry and professional&#13;
consulting associations in project design and implementation.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01 Led by the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector and industrial exports in&#13;
particular, Indonesia has achieved high rates of growth over the past quarter century,&#13;
comparable to other high performing East Asian countries. The main source of that&#13;
growth has been Indonesia's rich natural resources and low-wage labor force. However,&#13;
the prospects for sustaining rapid growth on that basis are diminishing. International&#13;
competition in labor-intensive manufacturing is intensifying with trade liberalization in&#13;
APEC, the global reduction of trade barriers and the emergence of a number of other low-&#13;
wage competitor countries. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) recognizes that&#13;
improved productivity, product quality, reliability and delivery will be central to&#13;
sustaining the country's export drive, overall economic growth and the growth of&#13;
employment.&#13;
1.02 GOI has undertaken a number of measures to achieve these objectives. Continued&#13;
economic deregulation and trade reform are putting pressure on firms to upgrade their&#13;
technological capabilities and improve competitiveness. In addition, access to foreign&#13;
technology to enhance competitiveness has substantially improved as a result of recent&#13;
efforts to create one of the most liberal foreign direct investment and trade regimes in&#13;
East Asia. As a complement, Indonesia spends about US$300 million annually on public&#13;
research and development (R&amp;D) to harness externalities and buttress the limited R&amp;D&#13;
done by private industry as well as to enhance the limited capacity of the private sector to&#13;
absorb and adapt imported technology. Indonesia has made substantial investments in the&#13;
development of scientific and technical manpower in its public technology support&#13;
institutions (PTSIs) and the Bank has assisted in this effort.&#13;
1.03 However, there is a major disconnect between the PTSIs and private industry.&#13;
Technical support services of the PTSIs are weak as are their marketing efforts to reach&#13;
out to industry, particularly small and medium industries (SMIs). Experiences of other&#13;
high performing countries in East Asia and Indonesia's ownl experience in several recent&#13;
Bank supported projects demonstrate the important contribution technology support&#13;
services can make to enhance the competitiveness of firms, especially SMIs, in domestic&#13;
and export markets.  But the domestic supply of those services is limited and is&#13;
predominantly provided by the PTSIs which employ about 80 percent of the country's&#13;
scarce scientific, technical and engineering manpower. While large firms can easily&#13;
import those services, there is a market imperfection for SMIs caused by a lack of&#13;
information about the availability of outside expertise for enhancing their&#13;

competitiveness; their perception that technology services are expensive and poor value&#13;
for money; and their lack of awareness of the potential gains in competitiveness that&#13;
could be achieved from using technology support services to adopt best management&#13;
practices. As a result, demand for those services has been somewhat limited. However,&#13;
competitive pressures on firms to upgrade their competitiveness through technology&#13;
upgrading is expected to increase as a result of growing competition in world markets for&#13;
Indonesia's manufactured products and the country's preannounced plan to significantly&#13;
reduce import protection over the next few years in the context of GATT and APEC&#13;
commitments. The proposed project would support measures to reorient Indonesia's&#13;
public technology support institutions to help meet the growing demands of the private&#13;
sector, especially SMIs, and encourage the private provision of technology support&#13;
services to improve competitiveness.&#13;

2. INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS: THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY&#13;
A.  Industrial Sector Background&#13;
2.01 The Indonesian economy has achieved consistently high rates of economic growth&#13;
in the last 25 years--averaging over 6 percent per year which is comparable to other high&#13;
performing East Asian countries. Per capita income increased more than fifteen-fold to&#13;
reach US$884 in 1994, and Indonesia has joined the ranks of middle-income countries.&#13;
Rapid economic growth has been led by the growth of the manufacturing sector which&#13;
has exceeded 10 percent per year since 1985/86. Manufacturing now accounts for about&#13;
21 percent of GDP and has become the largest sector in the economy.&#13;
2.02 Reform of economic policies played a major role in stimulating rapid growth of the&#13;
manufacturing sector. The reform effort was occasioned by the collapse in oil prices in&#13;
the early 1980s and the consequent prospect of slow economic growth. This led the&#13;
Government to reassess its economic strategy and embark on an economic reform&#13;
program in 1986 with the introduction of a series of periodic "deregulation packages" to&#13;
dismantle the restrictions that had been put in place during the previous period of inward-&#13;
oriented economic policies. The deregulation process continues today. Maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability through the judicious use of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate&#13;
policies also remains at the core of the reform program.&#13;
2.03 The deregulation process focused on three broad areas: (a) the trade regime,&#13;
including a reduction in the coverage of NTBs in manufacturing production, a lowering&#13;
of the tariff ceilings and the number of tariff rates; the provision of free trade status for&#13;
exporters through the introduction of duty drawback schemes; and reform of the customs&#13;
administration by transferring customs surveillance for nearly all imports to a reputed&#13;
private company; (b) the investment regime, including replacing a very complex&#13;
investment licensing list involving over 7,000 subsectors with a short negative list and&#13;
gradually reducing the number of activities on the negative list, simplifying investment&#13;
approval procedures by reducing the number of requirements, providing incentives in the&#13;
form of duty-free imports of machinery and equipment as well as inputs needed for initial&#13;
production, and encouraging foreign direct investment by providing the same incentives&#13;
as those accorded to domestic investors; and (c) the financial sector, including abolishing&#13;
credit ceilings, eliminating interest rate controls, reducing subsidized directed credits,&#13;
lowering entry barriers by permitting entry of new banks, including joint ventures with&#13;
foreign banks, and introducing measures to develop capital markets.'&#13;
The most recent deregulation packages in 1994-95 removed virtually all barriers to foreign investment, and&#13;
accelerated trade reform considerably by announcing a significant reduction in the average import tariff and&#13;
issuing a schedule for future tariff reductions to the year 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.04 These stabilization and deregulation efforts generated a very strong response from&#13;
the private sector, including a boom in private investment and rapid growth in output,&#13;
non-oil exports, employment and labor productivity. The manufacturing sector has led&#13;
the recovery of overall GDP, and helped diversify the economy away from its extreme&#13;
dependence on oil. Growth in manufacturing averaged 12 percent per year from 1986 to&#13;
1994, increasing its share in GDP from less than 12 percent to over 20 percent, and&#13;
almost tripling its absolute size from about US$10 billion to US$28 billion. In contrast to&#13;
1980-85, when a large proportion of growth originated from large capital-intensive&#13;
activities, labor-intensive sectors contributed most of the growth after 1986. Growth in&#13;
manufacturing employment and labor productivity averaged 7 percent per year, a rate&#13;
almost double that in the rest of the economy. The manufacturing sector contributed&#13;
about 30 percent of the growth in both non-oil GDP and total employment.&#13;
2.05 There also has been significant structural change in manufacturing in the form of a&#13;
substantial increase in the outward-orientation of the sector since the mid-1980s. From&#13;
1985/86 to 1992/93, manufactured export growth averaged about 30 percent, doubling the&#13;
sector export-to-output ratio to almost 20 percent. Exports contributed to over 40 percent&#13;
of manufacturing sector growth during the period, compared to only 13 percent during&#13;
1980-1985. The sector contributed about three-fourths of overall non-oil export growth&#13;
as the share of manufactured exports in total non-oil exports (and total exports) increased&#13;
from 38 percent (12 percent) to 63 percent (about 50 percent) between 1985/86 and&#13;
1994/95. Continued strong manufactured export growth also is considered to be the key&#13;
determinant of Indonesia's economic performance during the current Sixth Five-Year&#13;
Development Plan (REPELITA VI), which covers the period 1994/95-1998/99. The Plan&#13;
has programmed non-oil exports to increase by 17.8 percent per year in dollar terms,&#13;
compared to 17-9 percent yearly growth realized during REPELITA V.&#13;
2.06 Despite impressive recent performance by the manufacturing sector, however,&#13;
Indonesia's industrial structure exlibits a low level of product diversification and SMI&#13;
participation compared to other industrializing countries in the region, particularly the&#13;
more dynanmic NIEs. Almost 80 percent of the recent increase in manufactured exports&#13;
originated from the country's rich natural resource base--forestry-based wood products&#13;
and basic metals--and low-wage, labor-intensive activities--textiles, garments and&#13;
footwear. But Indonesia is being increasingly challenged in international markets by&#13;
even lower cost producers (e.g., China, India and Vietnam) in labor-intensive products.&#13;
The need for further industrial diversification was underscored by the relative weakening&#13;
in the export performance of the main traditional manufactured products--textiles and&#13;
garments, and plywood--in 1994 although part of the slack was taken up by strong&#13;
performance of footwear and electronics products, as well as growth in a number of other&#13;
product categories from a small base. The growth of total manufactured exports in&#13;
1994/95 was only 15 percent. compared to rates double that in previous years.  In&#13;
addition, industrial employment and output concentrated in a large number of micro&#13;
enterprises on one hand and large firms and business conglomerates on the other. The&#13;
shares of SMIs in total value added and total employment in industry is lower than those&#13;
in other high performing countries of East Asia (HPEACs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
2.07 Indonesia has made great strides in opening up its economy. Increasing competition&#13;
in and globalization of international markets of manufactured products will require&#13;
further deregulation of the economy. Corresponding action will need to be taken to&#13;
encourage more effective and better quality service provision to facilitate the adjustment&#13;
of industry, especially SMIs, to increasing competition and to reap the benefits from it.&#13;
The challenge for Indonesia is to further diversify its manufactured export base,&#13;
especially into skilled-labor intensive products, and increase efficiency and value added&#13;
in its traditional products by cutting costs and moving upmarket through management&#13;
improvements and technology upgrading particularly of SMIs.&#13;
B.  Science and Technology Strategy and Institutions&#13;
2.08 Indonesian firms will need to develop their technological capabilities to improve&#13;
their competitiveness and take advantage of the opportunities created by trade&#13;
liberalization within APEC, the reduction of global trade barriers and continued rapid&#13;
growth of world trade. International competitiveness increasingly requires firms to&#13;
compete on more than just the basis of factor cost advantages. Product development&#13;
capabilities, fast delivery, total quality--including the ability to meet customers' rigorous&#13;
quality standards and obtain ISO 9000 certification--and the ability to respond rapidly to&#13;
changing customer needs have all become increasingly important determinants of&#13;
competitive advantage.&#13;
2.09 The ability to compete on all these fronts is predicated heavily on the adoption of&#13;
best-practice technologies. There are two important lessons for Indonesia from the&#13;
experiences of the other HPEACs in this regard. First, overall economic policies play an&#13;
important role in promoting the development of technological capabilities for improved&#13;
competitiveness. Within the framework of sound macroeconomic, trade and competition&#13;
policies have played a key role in moving industry toward the international best-practice&#13;
frontier by compelling and enabling firms to lower costs, and improve product quality,&#13;
delivery and design. Second, even though the HPEACs vary widely with respect to their&#13;
development strategies, the role accorded to foreign investment and the extent of&#13;
government intervention, they all implemented specific technology policies to promote&#13;
the diffusion of technology and help their industrial sectors close the gap vis-a-vis&#13;
international best practice, recognizing the important externalities and market failures&#13;
associated with industrial technology development. Effective systems of metrology,&#13;
standards, testing and quality control (MSTQ), technology extension services and applied&#13;
R&amp;D have made important contributions to enhancing industrial competitiveness in those&#13;
countries.&#13;
2.10 The focus of Indonesia's technology policies, in contrast, has been on a major push&#13;
to develop several technology-intensive public sector "strategic industries", which&#13;
include aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding, electronics, telecommunications equipment&#13;
and steel making, with substantial public funding separate from the government budget&#13;
for science and technology. While these industries have made substantial progress in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
acquiring technological capabilities, they have had little impact on the technology&#13;
development and competitiveness of the rest of industry.&#13;
2.11 Indonesia also has been spending substantial resources to support public R&amp;D&#13;
laboratories. For the industrial sector there are three main public R&amp;D institutions that&#13;
provide technology support services. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) was&#13;
established in 1967. Its main task is assist the President in organizing national R&amp;D, to&#13;
give guidance, services and advice to Government on national science and technology&#13;
policy, improve Indonesia's scientific capability and cooperate with national and&#13;
international scientific bodies.  It also carries out basic research and technology&#13;
development activities in the natural sciences, engineering sciences, social sciences and&#13;
humanities and plays a major role in the development of the country's science and&#13;
technology infrastructure, including calibration and metrology and information services&#13;
in science and technology in over 19 centers for R&amp;D and technology services. LIPI&#13;
employs about 4,000 people including over 300 Ph.D. and Masters degree holders. In&#13;
1993/94 LIPI had a total operating budget, including development and recurrent&#13;
expenditure, equivalent to about US$42 million, of which about 90 percent was funded&#13;
by government.&#13;
2.12 The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) was&#13;
established in 1978 to be in charge of the selection, assessment and application of science&#13;
and technology for the development of national industry. Like LIPI, BPPT is a non-&#13;
departmental government agency reporting directly to the President. Its principal tasks&#13;
are to: (a) formulate technology policies and programs to promote industrial and national&#13;
development; (b) ensure coordination in the implementation of programs for the&#13;
assessment and application of technology; (c) provide services to government and the&#13;
private sector in the application of technology; (d) carry out technology related activities&#13;
in support of the government's development policies and the application of technology&#13;
for industrial and national development. BPPT consists of over 21 technical directorates&#13;
covering the basic and applied sciences, technology development, industrial analysis,&#13;
natural resource development and systems analysis, as well as a number of technical&#13;
laboratories in such fields as aero- and gas dynamics, energy resources, construction&#13;
testing. It employs about 3,000 people including over 300 Ph.D. and Masters degree&#13;
holders. In 1993/94 BPPT had a total operating budget, including development and&#13;
recurrent expenditure, equivalent to about US$42 million, of which about 95 percent was&#13;
funded by government.&#13;
2.13 There are 9 national level R&amp;D laboratories, specialized by industrial subsector&#13;
under the Ministry of Industry's Agency for Industrial Research and Development (BPPI)&#13;
as well as other specialized centers, e.g., the Center for Industrial Standards (PUSTAN),&#13;
and thirteen regional-level R&amp;D institutes. Their mission is to focus on applied R&amp;D&#13;
and technology support services, including testing and calibration services, for industry.&#13;
It employs about 3700 people including over 50 Ph.D. and Masters degree holders. In&#13;
1993/94 BPPI had a total operating budget, including development and recurrent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expenditure, equivalent to about US$14 million, of which about 70 percent was funded&#13;
by government.&#13;
2.14  These public technology support institutions typically are inward oriented and&#13;
supply-driven, and do not have the incentives or management systems to respond&#13;
effectively to the demands of private industry. As a result the degree of self-financing of&#13;
Indonesia's PTSIs tends to be low compared to other countries (Table 2.1).  The&#13;
Government has developed an Action Plan to substantially increase the degree of self-&#13;
financing of the PTSIs (para 3.13), in light of the need to commercialize their activities.&#13;
At the same time, while there are some notable exceptions, overall the PTSIs generally&#13;
are not at the cutting edge of science and technology, e.g., their scientific output in the&#13;
form of international patents or publications in internationally refereed journals is rather&#13;
limited. They also are fragmented across ministries and do little collaborative research&#13;
and development. Many of the PTSIs under the State Ministry for Research and&#13;
Technology often focus on supporting the strategic industries rather than the needs of the&#13;
private sector. Those under the Ministry of Industry focus more on private industry and&#13;
meeting the technology needs of SMIs in particular, but they are not commercially&#13;
oriented and have weak links with industry.&#13;

2.15 While Indonesia's deregulation program has created a conducive policy and&#13;
regulatory environment for technological upgrading in industry, technical support&#13;
services to facilitate the adoption and absorption of imported technology by industry,&#13;
particularly SMIs, are weak. Most of those services are provided by the PTSIs, where&#13;
over 80 percent of the country's scarce scientific, technical and engineering manpower&#13;
are employed. The private provision of those services to SMIs also are limited. There are&#13;
only a few domestic technology consulting firms that are perceived by Indonesian firms&#13;
to be of international quality (Annex 10). To match the other high performing countries&#13;
in the region, technology extension services need to be substantially strengthened to help&#13;
industrial firms adopt best practice, off-the-shelf imported technologies and improve&#13;
product quality, improve productivity, reduce rejects and production costs, and increase&#13;
yields. Indonesia now needs to place greater emphasis on supporting the private sector's&#13;
efforts, particularly those of small and medium enterprises, to improve their industrial&#13;
competitiveness through technological upgrading. The three major priorities are to: (a)&#13;
reorient the technology infrastructure towards the diffusion of best-practice technologies&#13;
in demand by industry through restructuring of the public R&amp;D institutions; (b)&#13;
strengthen technology extension and MSTQ services provided by the public and private&#13;
sectors; and (c) improve the coordination of technology and industrial development&#13;
policies and programs. These are the priorities addressed in the proposed Industrial&#13;
Technology Development Project (ITDP).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.  Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
3.01 Indonesia has had three World Bank funded projects supporting technology&#13;
development. The Science and Technology Training project (LN 2599-IND) provided&#13;
support for overseas training of scientists and engineers which was continued under the&#13;
Professional and Human Resources Development Project (LN 3134-IND). The latter&#13;
project also included financing for development of an Action Plan to strengthen industrial&#13;
technology development and for the design of improved management systems at the&#13;
Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) and the Indonesian&#13;
Institute of Sciences (LIPI). Those projects helped create a core team within BPPT and&#13;
LIPI that is working on a reorientation of technology policy toward the private sector and&#13;
has helped prepare the basic design of the project. With support from a Japanese Grant&#13;
Facility, each of the agencies were able to undertake a studv tour abroad to learn first-&#13;
hand how other countries have implemented similar technology projects. Preparation of&#13;
the project built on those earlier projects and took into account best practices&#13;
internationally and consideration of alternative project designs, including the lessons&#13;
drawn by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department from the implementation of&#13;
other Bank technology projects (Report No. 12138) and experiences with other projects&#13;
in Indonesia with technology related components, e.g., the Industrial Restructuring&#13;
Project (LN 3040-IND) which helped strengthen industrial metrology, testing  and&#13;
extension services under the Agency for Industrial R&amp;D of the Ministry of Industrv&#13;
(BPPI). Formulation of the project also benefited from the use of consultants who have&#13;
designed and implemented similar projects successfully elsewhere.  Based on the&#13;
experience of previous projects in Indonesia, the implementation of the project is&#13;
predicated on: (a) maximizing the use of existing resources and institutions; (b) having&#13;
clear performance standards and incentives for the public technology support institutions&#13;
to encourage them to be more responsive to the needs of industry; and (c) close&#13;
coordination within GOI in the development of policies, action plans and programns to&#13;
enhance industrial competitiveness through technology development.&#13;
B.  Project Objectives&#13;
3.02 The objective of the project is to enhance the competitiveness of Indonesian&#13;
industry, particularly of small and medium industries (SNMIs), by: (a) providing public&#13;
and private technology support services; (b) facilitating the access to public and private&#13;
technology service providers; (c) strengthening public technology support institutions;&#13;
and (d) improving the formulation and coordination of industrial technology policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
C.  Project Components and Description&#13;
3.03 The project has four components. It would: (a) strengthen Indonesia's system of&#13;
industrial metrology, standards, testing and quality (MSTQ) support services; (b) support&#13;
the diffusion of good technology practices through a cost-sharing matching grant fund to&#13;
finance the competitive provision of technology upgrading services to small and medium&#13;
industries (SMIs) by both public and private technology suppliers; (c) provide assistance&#13;
for reorienting the public research and development labs towards supporting more&#13;
effective technology development in private industry, especially SMIs; and (d) strengthen&#13;
the capacity to formulate and coordinate technology and industrial strategies, polices and&#13;
programs.&#13;
1. Improvement of Metrology, Standards, Testing and Quality (MSTQ)&#13;
Services&#13;
3.03 Effective MSTQ support services have an important role to play in enhancing&#13;
industrial competitiveness since the ability to compete in global markets is directly linked&#13;
to standards and product quality. However, those services are very weak in Indonesia.&#13;
Dissemination of national and international standards to industry, quality awareness&#13;
among firms and training in quality management practices for industry, especially SMIs,&#13;
is extremely limited. Testing and calibration services are weak, e.g., only three of the&#13;
twenty two laboratories under MOI are internationally accredited. The demand for&#13;
support services for upgrading product quality is growing rapidly as Indonesian firms&#13;
seek to attain the standards required in international markets, including ISO 9000&#13;
certification which is increasingly becoming a requirement to sell in major export&#13;
markets.  Using German and Japanese technical assistance Indonesia's National&#13;
Standards Council (DSN) has developed a good Master Plan to strengthen MSTQ&#13;
services in these areas (Annex 9). The project would support the efforts of the National&#13;
Metrology Center (KIM-LIPI) and the Ministry of Industry's Center for Industrial&#13;
Standards (PUSTAN) to implement their respective complimentary responsibilities under&#13;
that Master Plan through technical assistance and training to improve the dissemination&#13;
of standards to industry, especially SMIs; and implement programs for improved testing&#13;
and calibration services and national certification of product quality and quality&#13;
management practices, including ISO 9000 certification for industry.&#13;
3.04 The National Metrology Center (KIM). KIM is Indonesia's primary metrology&#13;
center; it also operates a national calibration network in which there are a number of&#13;
private as well as public sector calibration service providers. One of its major tasks is to&#13;
calibrate the equipment of public and private sector testing laboratories throughout the&#13;
country which is essential for ensuring the accuracy of their testing equipment. Firms also&#13;
have the choice of sending their equipment abroad for calibration, which is an expensive&#13;
option. However, KIM has yet to become recognized and accepted internationally.&#13;
Technical assistance would be provided for KIM--through a twinning arrangement with a&#13;
leading international metrology and calibration laboratory selected competitively using&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Bank guidelines (para 4.06)--for building its management and institutional capacity,&#13;
including improvement of the technical proficiency of KIM with the objective of gaining&#13;
international recognition and accreditation, which is vital to implementation of&#13;
Indonesia's ISO 9000 certification program. Performance targets for KIM were agreed&#13;
during appraisal (para 4.13).&#13;
3.05 Ministry of Industry's Center for Industrial Standards (PUSTAN). PUSTAN&#13;
also has an important role to play in the implementation of the national industrial&#13;
standards system and ISO 9000 certification of industrial enterprises. PUSTAN would&#13;
receive technical assistance under the project from an internationally reputed accredited&#13;
laboratory to improve the performance and institutional capacity of five of the Ministry of&#13;
Industry's testing laboratories to gain international recognition and/or accreditation.&#13;
Furthermore, MOI staff in eight MOI R&amp;D institutes would be trained as MSTQ&#13;
extension agents under the project. PUSTAN also would receive technical assistance to:&#13;
(a) develop in cooperation with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry&#13;
(KADIN) programs to promote quality awareness and implementation in industry; and&#13;
(b) initiate ISO 9000 certification of 40 SMIs as a pilot demonstration to the rest of&#13;
industry and as a learning-by-doing training program for its staff. A comprehensive&#13;
training program for managers, supervisors and quality personnel of SMIs in all aspects&#13;
of quality management would be instituted by PUSTAN in cooperation with several&#13;
Indonesian technical universities. In addition, PUSTAN would facilitate the translation&#13;
into Bahasa Indonesia and wide dissemination of eight major practical textbooks in the&#13;
field of MSTQ. Performance targets for PUSTAN were agreed during appraisal (para 4.&#13;
13).&#13;
2. Diffusion of Good Technology Practices&#13;
3.07 In Indonesia demand for technical advice for improving productivity, and product&#13;
quality, reliability, design and delivery times is expanding rapidly in response to&#13;
increasing international competition. Large and some medium-sized firms receive such&#13;
technology support services primarily through technology agreements with foreign joint-&#13;
venture partners, and from domestic and international consultants. However, most small&#13;
and medium sized firms do not have those contacts and often are reluctant to use such&#13;
expertise due to concerns about confidentiality, value for money and their often limited&#13;
ability to identify suitable experts and use them effectively. Those SMIs who do seek&#13;
assistance do so primarily from public technology support services and, increasingly,&#13;
private consulting firms and individual consultants (Annex 10) although the quality of&#13;
domestic service providers, both public and private, is generally weak. Yet demand for&#13;
technology support services is substantial and growing.&#13;
3.08 Several studies of Indonesian and international experience have shown that&#13;
technology support services can yield substantial economic benefits--in the form of&#13;
reduced product defects and wastage, faster turnaround times, improved labor&#13;
productivity, lower production costs and inventories, increased domestic sales and&#13;
exports of existing products and new product designs for firms--that are multiples of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
cost of these services. For example, the Export Development Project (LN 2702-IND) in&#13;
Indonesia, which helped finance technology and marketing support services to SMIs and&#13;
exporters, helped generate an increase in export revenues of US$17 for each US$1 spent&#13;
on those services.   Technology support services provided Linder the Industrial&#13;
Restructuring Project (LN 3040-IND) have also generated high returns for SMIs. Overall&#13;
Bank project experience (Annex 10) has shown that the use of technology support&#13;
services generates substantial economic benefits, at least 2-to-1, if provided effectively&#13;
and used properly, by allowing SMIs to implement low-cost improvements in production&#13;
processes and management. Their ability to expand sales on export and domestic markets&#13;
can increase significantly; hence, firms show a greater willingness to use consulting&#13;
assistance at full cost over time; and the number and quality of technology support&#13;
services available to SMIs increase. However, one of the key lessons from that experience&#13;
is that aggressive marketing efforts and the use of cost-sharing matching grants that still&#13;
ensure that SMIs bear a substantial portion of the cost of services are essential to: (a)&#13;
improving firms' access to technology support services; (b) helping off'set the initial&#13;
learning costs involved in using technology services; and (c) demonstrating to firms the&#13;
potential benefits of using teclnology support services.&#13;
3.09 Techniology Services Matching Grant Scheme.  The project will flund on a&#13;
matchinig-granit basis private sector acquisition of consultancy expertise to improve&#13;
industrial competitiveness through technology upgrading. To improve the provision of&#13;
technology upgrading services to SMIs the project would support the creation of a&#13;
Technology Services Matching Grant Scheme, known in Bahasa Indonesia as Dana&#13;
Kemitraan Peningkatan Teknologi Industri (DAPATI), whiclh would fLinld in the form of&#13;
granits to cover part of the costs of teclnical services for improving productivity,&#13;
improvinig product quality including obtaining ISO 9000 certification, improving product&#13;
design, improvinig response tmnes to clients' orders and introducing new technologies and&#13;
techniques to diversify and enhance an enterprise's production capacities in Indonesia.&#13;
All SMIs regardless of subsector would be eligible for DAPATI grants. Beneficiary&#13;
SMIs on Java would be eligible for a maximum of two DAPATI grants; the grant portion&#13;
would not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the technical services contract for the first&#13;
grant and 25 percent for the second grant. Beneficiary SMIs outside of Java would be&#13;
eligible for a maximum of three grants; the grant portion would not exceed 75 percent of&#13;
the cost of the technical services contract in the first grant, 50 percent in the second and&#13;
25 percent in the third. SMI beneficiaries of the scheme would pay the rest of the costs of&#13;
the technical services they receive under the DAPATI program.  Both foreign and&#13;
(domestically sourced technology services, whether from the public or private sectors,&#13;
vould qualify under the scheme as eligible service providers. An estimated 1,000 SMIs--&#13;
there are  over 300.000 industrial enterprises in Indonesia--would receive technology&#13;
support services under the DAPATI program with the pilot funding that would be&#13;
provided under the project. In addition, grant financing would be available for domestic&#13;
consultants specializing in provision of technology services on a matching grant basis to&#13;
organize and participate in training seminars to improve their capabilities to deliver&#13;
technology services to SMIs. e.g.. flexible manufacturing and production engineerinig.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.10 The attractiveness of DAPATI is that it is demand-responsive and promotes private&#13;
sector delivery of technology services while avoiding the creation of new government&#13;
agencies. The Ministry of Industry (MOI) will be the executing agency for the scheme.&#13;
However, its day-to-day administration will be contracted out to a private sector&#13;
management contractor which would establish small offices in several regions to provide&#13;
firms throughout Indonesia access to DAPATI. The private contractor would have three&#13;
principal functions: facilitating disbursements under the scheme; marketing the scheme to&#13;
industry; and building up a register of good quality providers of technology support&#13;
services. The management contractor also will prepare regular reports on the economic&#13;
impact of technical services delivered under the program on the SMI beneficiaries'&#13;
competitiveness which will be reviewed independently before completion of the project&#13;
against the experience of a control group to ascertain the impact of the DAPATI program.&#13;
The review also would help determine the need for continuation of the DAPATI program&#13;
after completion of the project. The design of DAPATI draws upon the successful&#13;
experiences of other countries that have implemented cost sharing schemes to promote&#13;
technology upgrading to enhance the competitiveness of industry (Annex 10). Those&#13;
programs have shown that, like DAPATI, a sustainable demand for technology services is&#13;
created when firms are required to pay a significant portion of the cost of consulting&#13;
services and the subsidy element is phased out during the life of the project, and there is&#13;
early and heavy emphasis on marketing the program and its demonstrated benefits.&#13;
During project preparation a detailed DAPATI Implementation Manual was developed&#13;
(Annex 1 1) which details the roles and responsibilities of the program participants, the&#13;
operating procedures and criteria for the program, and the performance indicators to be&#13;
used to monitor implementation progress.&#13;
3.11 DAPATI has been designed to ensure adequate quality of service delivery and to&#13;
minimize any possible misuse of funds under the program. First, an independent&#13;
management contractor would be selected to be responsible for day to day management&#13;
of the program. Second, the management contractor would in most cases be required to&#13;
pre-appraise service providers' credentials, provide training in consulting skills to be pre-&#13;
qualified service providers, and conduct a diagnostic audit of each firm's needs. Third,&#13;
while the management contractor would facilitate competitive selection of suitable&#13;
service providers under the program by inter alia providing the names of at least three&#13;
qualified service providers to requesting beneficiary firns, the final choice of service&#13;
provider rests with the beneficiary. Fourth, payment from the Bank loan of the matching&#13;
portion of the cost of services would be based on BAPPENAS benchmark prices;&#13;
additional fees and cost overruns would be borne by the beneficiary. Fifth, the SMI&#13;
would bear on average half the cost of those services to ensure that the firm is committed&#13;
to utilizing fully the services provided. Sixth, payment of the remaining balance of the&#13;
cost of services from the Special Account would be made only after verification by the&#13;
management contractor of the expected deliverables.  Seventh, the management&#13;
contractor would prepare regular reports on all service contracts financed for review by&#13;
the Technical Supervisory Committee and the Bank; part of this review would include a&#13;
post audit on the expected results of each consultancy. Eighth, each year the program&#13;
would be independently audited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
3.12 During negotiations GOI provided assurances that MOI will carry out the DAPATI&#13;
matching grant program in accordance with the DAPATI Implementation Manual,&#13;
including (i) entering into a management contract with a management consulting firm to&#13;
undertake the day-to-day operations; and (ii) maintaining a Technical Supervisory&#13;
Committee chaired by MOI and with representatives of BAPPENAS, MOF, BPPT, the&#13;
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Indonesian Association of&#13;
Professional Consultants, for purposes of the overall management of the DAPATI&#13;
program. In addition, MOI will, on March 31 of each year commencing on March 31,&#13;
1996, exchange views with the Bank on the continuing adequacy of the DAPATI&#13;
Implementation Manual and, with the Bank's prior concurrence, promptly revise the&#13;
above Manual accordingly. GOI has provided the Bank with: (a) the shortlist for the&#13;
management contractor and a funds flow mechanism for the DAPATI program that has&#13;
been approved by the Ministry of Finance and found to be acceptable to the Bank; (b)&#13;
confinnation that the DAPATI Technical Supervisory Committee has been established;&#13;
and (c) confirmation that the DAPATI Implementation Manual, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
has been adopted by the Ministry of Industry. During negotiations an agreement was&#13;
reached that as a condition of disbursement for DAPATI grants no withdrawals from the&#13;
loan shall be made unless: (i) the DAPATI Management Contract shall have been&#13;
entered into in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) the grant has been made in&#13;
accordance with the procedures set out in the DAPATI Manual (para 4.08).&#13;
3. Improvement of the Productivity of Public R&amp;D&#13;
3.13 As noted earlier (para 2.11), industrial R&amp;D in the public sector is carried out by&#13;
LIPI, BPPT and the industrial labs under the Ministry of Industry. These institutions are&#13;
primarily inward looking and largely disconnected from the needs of industry, each other,&#13;
and the global frontier of R&amp;D with little knowledge of international best practices for&#13;
improving industrial competitiveness through technology upgrading (para 2.14). Their&#13;
organization, funding and incentive structure do not encourage close collaboration with&#13;
industry. Contract research with industry forms a very small part of their work.&#13;
Researchers have had little incentive to undertake contract research because of rigid&#13;
government rules regarding the use of earnings generated from the sale of technology and&#13;
technical services to industry. Projects are typically formulated at the initiative of&#13;
researchers, often without any input from industry and with insufficient market testing or&#13;
involvement by potential users during the R&amp;D phase. The Government of Indonesia&#13;
now has begun to implement measures to give the public technology support institutions&#13;
(PTSIs) incentives to become more demand driven, professionally managed and&#13;
commercially oriented, and make them more agile in responding to the technological&#13;
needs of industry. During the project further measures would be taken as part of GOI's&#13;
Action Plan to implement an incentive scheme for commercialization of the PTSIs&#13;
(Annex 12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
3.14 Improved Management at BPPT and LIPI. To complement measures to improve&#13;
autonomy and accountability, and give incentives to provide effective technology support&#13;
services, the project would support improvements in the internal management systems of&#13;
BPPT and LIPI. Under the project, they would receive technical assistance through&#13;
twinning arrangements with internationally reputed contract research organizations to&#13;
strengthen their capabilities. This would entail: (a) strengthening the core functions for&#13;
managing contract research, including business development, contract administration,&#13;
intellectual property management and communications at the Technology Services&#13;
Organization (TSO) of LIPI and the Technology and Business Integration Services Unit&#13;
(TBIS) at BPPT; (b) strengthening BPPT and LIPI's core management information&#13;
systems in key industrial R&amp;D activities and laboratories, including finance and budget,&#13;
human resources administration, project management and procurement and inventory&#13;
management systems; and (c) providing support for management development. The&#13;
project would also include financing to cover the essential requirements of computer&#13;
hardware and software to implement the improved management systems. This support&#13;
would be focused on helping BPPT and LIPI increase their self-financing from 5 and 10&#13;
percent, respectively today, to 25 percent for both institutions by the year 2000/01, and&#13;
better cost accounting and budgeting systems would improve the pricing of their services&#13;
and the transparency of resource management at BPPT and LIPI.&#13;
3.15 Restructuring Selected Laboratories.  In addition to providing support for&#13;
improved R&amp;D management at the overall institutional level, three laboratories were&#13;
selected for comprehensive restructuring during the project as demonstrations of the&#13;
benefits from detailed restructuring. The project will support two R&amp;D centers under the&#13;
Ministry of Industry, and one under LIPI. These three R&amp;D centers were selected for&#13;
project support based on: (a) development during project preparation of solid business&#13;
plans that demonstrate their intention and specific steps to serve industry more&#13;
effectively, including realistic targets for substantially increasing revenue generation from&#13;
the sale of technology and technical services to industry; (b) the capability to provide the&#13;
technology upgrading services outlined in those plans; and, (c) the track record of their&#13;
management of providing effective leadership. In addition, the Asian Development Bank&#13;
(ADB) will support the modernization of eight other MOI R&amp;D labs under their proposed&#13;
Industrial Technology and Human Resource Development Project in line with the&#13;
approach and policy framework developed under the proposed project.&#13;
3.16 The World Bank supported project would provide assistance for restructuring the&#13;
R&amp;D Center for Applied Chemistry (RDCAC) under LIPI. RDCAC is strong in basic&#13;
research and applied technology for the chemical industry. With support under the&#13;
project, RDCAC's restructuring program would strengthen its R&amp;D management,&#13;
downstream processing in biotechnology, engineering and development of membrane&#13;
systems and catalyst process technology, and also upgrade its library, documentation and&#13;
information services. Today about one-third of RDCAC's budget is earned from the sale&#13;
of technology and technical services to industry. With support under the project that&#13;
share is expected to rise to nearly 60 percent by the year 2000 through the&#13;
implementation of improved technology marketing and R&amp;D management systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
3.17 The project would further support the Institute for Research and Development for&#13;
Chemical Industry (IRDCI) under the Ministry of Industry. IRDCI also specializes in the&#13;
chemical industry, although its human resource base is not nearly as strong as its&#13;
counterpart under LIPI, RDCAC. The institute has so far focused primarily on routine&#13;
testing and certification. Today about 17 percent of IRDCI's budget is earned from the&#13;
sale of those services to industry. Support for the IRDCI under the project would&#13;
strengthen its capabilities to do technology marketing, strengthen its process design and&#13;
engineering capability, and R&amp;D capabilities in natural products technology and&#13;
packaging technology where the institute has some basic strengths and where domestic&#13;
demand for technology support services is substantial and growing. Under the project,&#13;
IRDCI of MOI would work closely with RDCAC of LIPI, which is much stronger in&#13;
R&amp;D for the chemical industry, to carry out joint R&amp;D and industry-outreach programs&#13;
as a demonstration of the benefits of close cooperation among institutes across&#13;
Indonesia's fragmented R&amp;D system. With support under the project the share of&#13;
industrial earnings from the sale of technology and technical services in IRDCI's budget&#13;
is expected to rise to about 50 percent by the year 2000.&#13;
3.18 The other MOI institute supported under the project is the Semarang Industrial&#13;
R&amp;D Institute (BISm), which is a regional R&amp;D institute in Central Java that specializes&#13;
in waste water and air pollution control technologies. Unlike other R&amp;D institutes under&#13;
MOI, which primarily offer testing and allied services, the Semarang Institute also&#13;
undertakes significant R&amp;D and design work: its industrial earnings from R&amp;D per staff&#13;
is the highest among all the R&amp;D institutes under MOI. Project support for the Institute&#13;
would strengthen its ability to supply clean technologies, disposal monitoring services,&#13;
and waste treatment equipment design services, and the ability to properly price and&#13;
protect the technologies it develops. Today about 48 percent of the Semarang Institute's&#13;
budget is earned from the sale of technology and technical services to industry. With&#13;
support of the project that share is expected to rise to 75 percent by the year 2000.&#13;
3.19 The technical assistance provided to facilitate the restructuring of these three R&amp;D&#13;
institutes would take the form of twinning arrangements with internationally reputed&#13;
R&amp;D laboratories in their respective fields that have managed the transition to becoming&#13;
demand driven, successful public technology support institutions.  These twinning&#13;
partners would be competitively selected following Bank procurement guidelines (para&#13;
4.06). Successful restructuring of these selected institutes would provide the basis for&#13;
subsequent restructuring of other R&amp;D institutes in Indonesia.&#13;
3.20 During negotiations the Bank reviewed and agreed upon GOI's Action Plan of&#13;
policy measures to be undertaken to encourage the commercialization of the PTSIs (para&#13;
3.13), including the key performance targets that are to be achieved by each PTSI&#13;
supported under the project. GOI also submitted a formal letter from the Minister of&#13;
Finance confirming that GOI would implement the new incentive scheme for the&#13;
commercialization of the PTSIs under the project. Furthermore, an understanding was&#13;
reached that issuance of the regulations and all other related documentation required to&#13;
implement the new incentive scheme for commercialization of the PTSIs that are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of disbursement for any equipment and the&#13;
twinning arrangements under this part of the project (para 4.08).&#13;
4. Improvement of Industrial and Technology Policy Formulation&#13;
3.21 The formulation of technology and industrial policies in Indonesia has proceeded&#13;
along largely separate tracks by different ministries. Preparation of the proposed project&#13;
has constituted an important step in improving coordination among BPPT, MOI and&#13;
BAPPENAS in the development and implementation of industrial and technology&#13;
policies and programs in Indonesia. To support that process further, a small component&#13;
of the project would consist of technical assistance to the Science and Technology Policy&#13;
Unit of BPPT which would strengthen the ability to monitor and evaluate the impact of&#13;
on-going technology programs and formulate results-oriented technology policies and&#13;
more effective coordinating mechanisms for improving Indonesia's industrial&#13;
competitiveness through technology upgrading. Technical assistance also would be&#13;
provided under the project to the Policy Advisory Unit of the Agency for Industrial R&amp;D&#13;
under the Ministry of Industry to design collaborative programs with the private sector&#13;
for strengthening industrial competitiveness and to prepare the next phases of the&#13;
deregulation process. Terms of reference for the major policy studies that are to be&#13;
conducted by the two units and their required consultancy support have been agreed.&#13;
D.  Project Costs&#13;
Summary of Costs&#13;
3.22 The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$60.9 million equivalent&#13;
(Rp. 133.7 billion), including contingencies but excluding taxes and duties. Table 3.1&#13;
below summarizes the estimated costs by project component. Detailed project costs are&#13;
given in Annex 2.&#13;
Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
3.23 Baseline Costs. Baseline costs are estimated at May 1995 prices. Equipment and&#13;
furniture costs are based on current prices for similar imported or locally available items.&#13;
Technical assistance and training costs are based on recent costs for comparable technical&#13;
assistance and training being provided by the Bank under other projects and by other&#13;
institutions. The costs were estimated as follows: (i) specialist services, US$130,000 per&#13;
year; (ii) foreign short-term consultants, US$20,000 per month; (iii) international travel,&#13;
US$4,000 per trip; (iv) subsistence, US$150 per diem; (v) short-term overseas training&#13;
(3-6 months). US$15,000 per person.&#13;

3.24 Contingency Allowances. Project costs include physical contingencies for all&#13;
categories of expenditure, estimated at 5.0 percent of base costs. Price contingencies&#13;
have also been added, with annual escalation rates of 5.0 percent for local costs and 2.2&#13;
percent for foreign costs during project implementation which is expected to take 5 years,&#13;
from 1996/1997 to 2000/2001.&#13;
3.25 Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs, including contingencies, are&#13;
estimated at US$45.3 million (representing 74 percent of total project costs) and are&#13;
based on a detailed analysis of projected expenditures and the experience of comparable&#13;
projects in Indonesia. The foreign exchange percentages for major expenditure categories&#13;
are estimated as follows: (i) 100 percent for database subscription and overseas study&#13;
tours; (ii) 90 percent for laboratory equipment and supplies, computers and office&#13;
equipment, books for library, short- and long-term consultants, and twinning&#13;
arrangements; (iii) 80 percent for research and policy studies; (iv) 50 percent for other&#13;
office supplies, and staff training and development; and (v) zero percent for civil works&#13;
and furniture.&#13;

E. Financing Plan&#13;
3.27 The proposed loan of US$47.0 million equivalent would finance 77 percent of the&#13;
total project costs; industry would finance US$6.2 million (or 10 percent of the total&#13;
project costs) as its share of technology services that would receive matching grant&#13;
financing under DAPATI, the Technology Services Matching Grant Scheme; and GOI&#13;
would finance remaining costs of US$7.7 million (or 13 percent of the total project&#13;
costs). Table 3.2 below summarizes the project financing plan.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.  Implementation Agencies&#13;
4.01 BPPT, LIPI and MOI would be responsible for the implementation of their&#13;
respective components of the project. In particular, KIM under LIPI and PUSTAN under&#13;
MOI will carry out the implementation of the MSTQ component of the project; MOI will&#13;
carry out implementation of the DAPATI program; MOI, BPPT and LIPI will implement&#13;
the component for strengthening public R&amp;D; and MOI and BPPT will carry out the&#13;
component for improving the formulation and coordination of industrial and technology&#13;
policies. For each component of the project, the implementing agencies have prepared a&#13;
project management and implementation plan which includes the scope and objectives of&#13;
their components, and their implementation schedules. These documents are part of the&#13;
project file and are referenced in the loan documents. They will also provide the&#13;
reference benchmarks for Bank supervision of the project components (para 4.12). In&#13;
addition, each plan clearly specifies the key milestones and provides the project's&#13;
perfornance indicators which will measure both the attainment of physical targets for&#13;
project implementation as well as the progress in achieving the project's objectives and&#13;
its developmental impact (Annex 5).&#13;
B.  Project Coordination&#13;
4.02 Prior to the project, each agency established its own Project Management and&#13;
Implementation Unit (PMIU). In addition, a Central PMIU has been established to&#13;
ensure coordination and collaboration among the project components.  Annex 4&#13;
summarizes the functions and responsibilities of these units. The Central PMIU reports to&#13;
a Steering Committee consisting of representatives of each of the implementing agencies&#13;
and the private sector, and is chaired by BAPPENAS. During negotiations agreement&#13;
was reached that: (a) the Bank loan could be used to finance up to US$100,000 for&#13;
necessary equipment for the PMIUs; and (b) up to US$400,000 in short-term consultant&#13;
services to support the activities of the PMIUs, including preparation of the mid-term&#13;
review report and Implementation Completion Report for the project (paras 4.13 and&#13;
4.14).&#13;
C.  Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.03 The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period starting from&#13;
1996/1997 to 2000/2001. The project is estimated to be completed by June 30, 2001, and&#13;
the loan closing date would be December 31, 2001. The implementation schedules of the&#13;
major components of the project are shown in Annex 4.&#13;

D.  Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.04 A summary of procurement arrangements is given in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
Procurement will be the responsibility of the Project Monitoring and Implementation&#13;
Unit (PMIU) under each of the three implementing agencies (MOI, BPPT and LIPI)&#13;
which will organize bid evaluation and consultant selection committees for all&#13;
procurement activities. Some of the participating institutions are already well aware of&#13;
Bank procurement guidelines. Further training in Bank procurement and disbursement&#13;
will be done during the post-appraisal follow-up by the Bank's field office in Indonesia&#13;
and at a planned project launch workshop. The World Bank standard bidding documents&#13;
and contract forms would be adopted for all procurement of goods under international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) and selection of consultants.&#13;

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts financed by the Bank.&#13;
N.B.F. - Not Bank Financed.&#13;
4.05 Goods. Procurement for all laboratory and office equipment amounting to or more&#13;
than US$200,000 would be based on contracts awarded following international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, in accordance with "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under Bank Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995. Small contracts for equipment&#13;
and supplies amounting to less than US$50,000 per contract and up to an aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
amount equivalent to US$1.9 million, would be procured through international shopping&#13;
with price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers from two different eligible&#13;
countries, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. More specialized&#13;
laboratory equipment will be procured through limited international bidding (LIB), up to&#13;
US$200,000 per contract and an aggregate of US$2.9 million. For items under shopping&#13;
and limited international bidding, international competitive bidding would not offer any&#13;
special advantage because of their specialized nature and small value. Highly specialized&#13;
proprietary laboratory equipment, books and database subscriptions, up to an aggregated&#13;
value of about US$2.8 million, will be procured under direct contracting.&#13;
4.06 Consulting Services.  Consulting services, including twinning arrangements,&#13;
training and research and policy studies and other technical assistance, are a major focus&#13;
of this project. Consulting services would be selected in accordance with "Guidelines:&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency", dated August 1981. Technology services to be financed under the DAPATI&#13;
program (Technology Upgrading Matching Grant Scheme) will be awarded to service&#13;
providers (both private and public) according to commercial procedures, generally by&#13;
direct contracting arrangements where quality would remain of paramount importance.&#13;
As indicated in the DAPATI Implementation Manual, the management contractor (which&#13;
will be selected on a competitive basis according to the Bank consultant selection&#13;
procedures), under the guidance of the Technical Supervisory Committee, will ensure that&#13;
the technology service contracts are awarded at a reasonable cost, and also by taking into&#13;
account other relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and quality of the&#13;
services and the competency of the respective service providers. The complete bid&#13;
packages for all the main technical assistance contracts under the project, including letters&#13;
of invitation, terms of reference, and consultant shortlists have been agreed upon.&#13;
4.07 Review Procedures. All contracts for goods estimated to cost US$200,000 or&#13;
more will be subject to the Bank's prior review. Contracts below the above threshold&#13;
will be subject to the Bank's post review on a selective basis. All consultants' contracts&#13;
for employment of individual consultants estimated to cost above US$50,000 or of&#13;
consulting firms estimated to cost above US$100,000, would require the Bank's prior&#13;
review. With regard to the cost sharing technology services provided under the DAPATI&#13;
program, contracts below US$25,000 would be reviewed and managed by the&#13;
Management Contractor. Contracts under the DAPATI program above US$25,000 would&#13;
be reviewed by the Technical Supervisory Committee. The Bank will review the first&#13;
five contracts, regardless of size, to ensure proper procedures are being followed.&#13;
Thereafter, all contracts valued over US$50,000 relating to the DAPATI program would&#13;
be reviewed by the Bank and a post review on a selective basis would be conducted. All&#13;
procurement activities carried out will be reported to the Bank in the Semi-annual&#13;
Progress Reports (para 4.13).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
4.08 The Bank Loan will be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of foreign or local (ex-&#13;
factory) expenditures for laboratory equipment and supplies, and computers or 65 percent&#13;
of local expenditures for other items procured locally; (b) 90 percent of expenditures for&#13;
books and database subscriptions; (c) 80 percent of the expenditures for consulting&#13;
services, twinning arrangements, staff training and development, as well as research and&#13;
policy studies; (d) 80 percent of the management contract for the Technology Services&#13;
Matching Grant Scheme (DAPATI); and (e) 100 percent of DAPATI grants which would&#13;
cover 50 percent and 25 percent of the first and second consultancy costs, respectively,&#13;
for firrns operating in Java, and 75 percent, 50 percent and 25 percent of the first second&#13;
and third consultancy costs, respectively, for firms operating outside of Java. Table 4.2&#13;
shows the allocation of loan proceeds to each category. The Bank Loan will not finance&#13;
civil works, furniture and other office supplies, or any recurrent costs. No withdrawals&#13;
shall be made in respect of: (a) DAPATI grant unless: (i) the DAPATI Management&#13;
Contract shall have been entered into a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.12); and&#13;
(ii) the grant has been made in accordance with the procedures set out in the DAPATI&#13;
Implementation Manual (para 3.10); or (b) equipment and the twinning arrangements&#13;
required to implement the third component of the project--improved public R&amp;D&#13;
management--unless the Ministry of Finance shall have issued the necessary regulations&#13;
and all other related documentation satisfactory to the Bank required to implement the&#13;
Action Plan to commercialize the PTSIs (para 3.20).&#13;
4.09 Withdrawal applications would be fully documented for all expenditures against&#13;
which loan disbursements would be made, except for the following contracts for which&#13;
loan disbursements would be made based on the Statements of Expenditures (SOEs): (a)&#13;
contracts for equipment, books, and database subscription estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000; (b) contracts for twinning arrangements, training, and research and policy&#13;
studies estimated to cost less than US$100,000; (c) consulting firm contracts, excluding&#13;
those under the DAPATI program, valued at less than US$100,000 and individual&#13;
consultant contracts valued at less than US$50,000; and (d) those technical services&#13;
contracts under the DAPATI program valued less than US$50,000 after the first five&#13;
contracts have been approved. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by the&#13;
respective project implementing units and made available for review as requested by&#13;
Bank supervision missions. The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank&#13;
loan is shown at Annex 7 and is based on the standard disbursement profile for projects in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
4.10 Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government would&#13;
establish a Special Account in Bank Indonesia. The initial deposit of the special account&#13;
would be limited to US$1.0 million, which would be increased to US$3.5 million,&#13;
covering approximately four months of eligible expenditures, when the aggregate amount&#13;
of withdrawal from the Loan plus the total amount of all outstanding special&#13;
commitments reach US$7.0 million. This account would be maintained by the Director&#13;
General of Budget, MOF. All disbursements from the Bank loan would be made through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the Special Account. Replenishment applications to the Special Account will be made on&#13;
a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever&#13;
occurs first. During negotiations an agreement was reached that the Special Account and&#13;
the necessary organizational structure for its operation, including appropriate accounting&#13;
and auditing procedures, would be established in a manner satisfactory to the Bank in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;

E. Project Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.1 1 During negotiations, the Bank received assurances that MOI, BPPT and LIPI would&#13;
establish and maintain project related accounts for their respective project components.&#13;
Those project accounts, to reflect all project resources, expenditures, assets and liabilities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
would be maintained annually in accordance with generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles.  The annual project accounts would be prepared in accordance with&#13;
international accounting standards and audited in accordance with international standards&#13;
on auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. A review of the Special&#13;
Account and an auditor's opinion with special emphasis on the audit of SOEs would be&#13;
provided annually. The auditor's report would include a statement on the adequacy of the&#13;
accounting systems and internal controls, the reliability of the statement of expenditures&#13;
as a basis for loan disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. The audited&#13;
project accounts and the auditor's report thereof would be submitted to the Bank within&#13;
six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
F.   Project Monitoring, Reporting And Supervision&#13;
4.12 The Bank would closely supervise project implementation by undertaking regular&#13;
field missions.  A  tentative schedule for supervision activities and missions is&#13;
summarized in Annex 8. The Bank will closely monitor performance of each component&#13;
against: (a) the progress of procurement, disbursement and physical implementation of&#13;
each project componenit (Annex 4); (b) the benchmarks for the key performance&#13;
indicators in Annex 5, which will measure the monitorable results to be achieved under&#13;
the project; and (c) compliance with the Action Plan (Annex 12). An understanding was&#13;
reached during negotiations that at the mid-term review the amounts earmarked in the&#13;
loan for any beneficiaries that fail to reach its mid-term performance targets, and fail to&#13;
produce credible action plans to achieve compliance, would be canceled from the loan.&#13;
4.1 3 During negotiations, the Bank received assurances that the Government will&#13;
monitor and evaluate, on an ongoing basis and in accordance with the agreed&#13;
performance indicators, the implementation of the Project. In particular, each project&#13;
implementing agency will prepare progress reports on implementation of its respective&#13;
project component on a semi-annual basis by June 30 and December 31 of each year&#13;
beginning on June 30, 1996, including informnation of performance against the&#13;
benchmarks for each component (Annex 5), procurement information and expenditure&#13;
statements. Such semi-annual progress reports will be consolidated by the Central PMIU&#13;
and submitted to the Project Steering Committee and the Bank within two months after&#13;
the end of each reporting period. In addition, agreement and assurances were obtained&#13;
during negotiations that GOI would ensure that a mid-term evaluation of the project's&#13;
performance against its objectives be carried out in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and that the report on the findings and recommendations of that&#13;
review would be furnished to the Bank by September 30, 1998, which would be reviewed&#13;
by the Bank and GOI by November 1, 1998.&#13;
4.14 The Project Completion Date is expected to be June 30, 2001, while the Closing&#13;
Date would be December 31, 2001. An implementation completion report (ICR) will be&#13;
submitted by GOI to the Bank within four months of the Closing Date of the Bank Loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A.  Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
5.01 Through past projects in the area of science and technology, the Bank has&#13;
developed a close relationship with Government counterparts in the field of technology&#13;
(BPPT, LIPI, MOI, BAPPENAS). In the course of project preparation, the Bank has&#13;
expanded its previous focus on science and technology training to establish a dialogue&#13;
with Government agencies and the private sector on the public sector role in the provision&#13;
of technology services. The proposed project would allow the Bank to maintain and&#13;
expand this dialogue, and ensure that it leads to results on the ground.&#13;
5.02 The 1995 Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia emphasizes the importance of&#13;
improving Indonesia's competitiveness and the need for a shift toward a productivity&#13;
based economy and the complimentary private provision of supporting infrastructure&#13;
services. The proposed project addresses each of these areas through its support for more&#13;
effective provision of technology services to help improve the competitiveness of&#13;
Indonesian industry. The package of policy reforms, institutional strengthening and&#13;
capacity building supported under the project is in particular expected to make a&#13;
contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of Indonesia's SMI manufacturing sector,&#13;
the target group of the project. The experience gained under the project would provide a&#13;
useful input into Indonesia's technology policies and programs.&#13;
5.03 In the expectation of closer Bank cooperation, GOI also has introduced, for the first&#13;
time, performance measurement and measures to promote accountability in public R&amp;D&#13;
management in Indonesia. Project preparation has been an instrument for establishing&#13;
consensus and coordination among these Government agencies and a dialogue with&#13;
private industry, which are essential to strengthening the link between technology and&#13;
industrial policies. Our involvement has helped GOI to take advantage of the lessons&#13;
from Bank-supported technology projects throughout the world and prompted it to take a&#13;
more pro-active stance in focusing industrial technology development policies and&#13;
programs and in aligning them more clearly with private sector development and&#13;
industrial competitiveness. The Bank has also played a key role in establishing a&#13;
common policy and institutional framework for industrial technology development that is&#13;
being supported by other financiers, including the Asian Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
B.  Project Justification&#13;
Project Rationale and Design&#13;
5.04 Over the last decade, the Indonesian Government has been engaged in a process of&#13;
deregulating the economy, liberalizing the foreign investment regime, and lowering&#13;
import barriers, all of which have increased competitive pressures and hence the demand&#13;
for technology services. Against this background, the proposed project seeks to improve&#13;
the productivity of the Government's expenditures in the technology area so as to&#13;
maximize the supply-side response to the opening of the economy.&#13;
5.05 Specifically, the project addresses two important market failures in the area of&#13;
technology-services.  First, there is a demand-side failure. Many Indonesian SMI&#13;
managers underestimate the value of and need for technology improvements, and are&#13;
reluctant to spend scarce funds on new technologies. Temporary cost buy-downs on&#13;
technological services, by encouraging reluctant firms to move up the learning curve and&#13;
thereby inducing spillover or demonstration effects on neighboring firms, would help&#13;
overcome this problem. Second, there is a supply-side failure. Even if technology&#13;
demanders were perfectly informed about the value of new technology, technology&#13;
services, if left to the market, would be underprovided, on account of their public good&#13;
nature (the available supply of a new technology is not diminished by the adoption by a&#13;
firm of that technology).&#13;
5.06 The project addresses these market failures by lowering the cost (through subsidies)&#13;
of technology services, both public and private. In particular, the DAPATI scheme is a&#13;
response to the first market failure: its declining schedule of subsidies for technology&#13;
services is specifically designed to encourage firms to test the waters and move up the&#13;
technology learning curve.&#13;
5.07 The existence of market failure in itself can only point to the consideration of&#13;
govemment action; it cannot justify it. The possibility of "govemment failure"--of the&#13;
govemment's involvement only making matters worse--must also be considered,&#13;
especially in countries such as Indonesia, where the track-record of public sector&#13;
technology institutions is mixed. The project addresses the risk of government failure,&#13;
and attempts to minimize it in various ways:&#13;
(i)  the provision, through DAPATI, of subsidies for private as well as public&#13;
providers of technology services will facilitate the development of private-sector&#13;
technology suppliers, unencumbered by the bureaucratic constraints of the public&#13;
sector and subject to the forces of competition;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(ii) improved efficiency, industry-responsiveness and commercialization of&#13;
government sector institutes are explicit aims of the project. The PTSIs will be&#13;
forced to become more reliant on industry for their revenue, and will be given&#13;
technical assistance to enable them to do so;&#13;
(iii) the heavy reliance on performance targets, and the incentives imbedded in the&#13;
project to meet these, will promote better performance and also help develop a&#13;
result-oriented outlook among the PTSIs; and&#13;
(iv) the DAPATI program has been designed as a pilot. It will be closely&#13;
monitored and thoroughly evaluated, including through the use of a sample survey,&#13;
both to ensure effective use of funds and to provide a good information base on&#13;
which to decide whether or not to continue with the program  after project&#13;
completion (see 5.1 2).&#13;
In summary, the project has been designed to help overcome market failures in the key&#13;
area of technology service provision, while minimizing the likelihood of government&#13;
failure.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
5.08 The benefits of the project do not lend themselves to precise quantitative analysis.&#13;
However, there is ample evidence from the high performing East Asian countries and&#13;
previous projects in Indonesia that effective technology support services do yield high&#13;
economic and financial retums for manufacturing companies through reduced product&#13;
defects, faster manufacturing turnaround times, lower inventories, higher productivity,&#13;
increased domestic and export sales and new product designs. These benefits are&#13;
multiples of the cost of the corresponding services and substantially increase the returns&#13;
to SMIs' existing investments in plant, equipment and human capital.&#13;
5.09 Any consideration of benefits must also take into account the substantial, though&#13;
again not easily quiantified, catalytic effect the project would have on ongoing public&#13;
sector investments in the provision of technological services.  Given its focus on&#13;
improving the incentives and management practices of the participating PTSIs, the&#13;
project can be expected, if successful, to have a demonstration effect which would&#13;
influence overall Government technology policy and expenditures in the direction of&#13;
commercialization, accountability and transparency. An alternative project design based&#13;
on investing heavily in additional equipment for selected Government research institutes&#13;
was considered but rejected on the grounds that it would not have this catalytic impact.&#13;
Instead, planned investments in new equipment have been kept to the bare minimum&#13;
required to implement the business plans of the participating PTSIs. This approach has&#13;
worked well in other Bank technology projects, notably in the Industrial Technology&#13;
Development Project (LN 3119-IN, CR 2064) in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29-&#13;
Fiscal Impact&#13;
5.10 The project is expected to have a positive fiscal impact since it would enable the&#13;
Government to deliver the same level of technology services with a lower budget. There&#13;
are two reasons for this. First, the expected net impact of the project on the private&#13;
provision of technology services is positive (mainly as a result of the DAPATI program,&#13;
and the stimulus to demand this will give). Second, the self-financing ratio of the PTSIs&#13;
would increase as a result of the project.&#13;
C.  Project Risks&#13;
5.11 The reorientation of the public technology infrastructure towards commercial use&#13;
and result-oriented management, the effective coordination of Government policies for&#13;
industry and science and technology and the development of competent private service&#13;
providers may be slower than envisaged. Similarly, the SMI sector may be slow in&#13;
accessing the new services being offered.  To help minimize these risks, project&#13;
preparation was extended to: (a) help build consensus within Government on the need for&#13;
and ways to achieve this strategic reorientation of public support for technology&#13;
development, including drawing on best practices from other countries' experiences; (b)&#13;
develop a new policy framework that will drive the PTSIs to commercialize their research&#13;
and development and require of them greater accountability for achieving measurable&#13;
results, and increased transparency and better management of the operations of the PTSIs;&#13;
(c) provide the PTSIs under the project an opportunity to develop sound business plans&#13;
for their commercialization based on assessments of market demands and build a pipeline&#13;
of technology projects with private industry; and (d) obtain the participation of private&#13;
industry and professional consulting associations in project design and implementation.&#13;
5.12 There is also a risk in relation to sustainability. As mentioned, DAPATI is a pilot&#13;
scheme. There is a danger that, even if it were considered a great success, the&#13;
Government, for budgetary reasons, would not continue to fund it after project&#13;
completion. In this regard, the planned evaluation of DAPATI would provide the&#13;
Government with a very good information base on which to decide the future of the&#13;
program. The Bank would also review with the Government throughout the project&#13;
implementation period the success of DAPATI, and plans, if appropriate, for its extension&#13;
after the closing date for the project.&#13;
&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.01  During negotiations GOI provided assurances that:&#13;
(i)    MOI will carry out the DAPATI matching grant program in accordance&#13;
with the DAPATI Implementation Manual, including (a) entering into a&#13;
management contract with a management consulting firm to undertake the day-to-&#13;
day operations; (b) maintaining a Technical Supervisory Committee chaired by&#13;
MOI and with representatives of BAPPENAS, MOF, BPPT, the Indonesian&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Indonesian Association of&#13;
Professional Consultants, for purposes of the overall management of the DAPATI&#13;
program. In addition, MOI will, on March 31 of each year commencing on March&#13;
31, 1996, exchange views with the Bank on the continuing adequacy of the&#13;
DAPATI Implementation Manual and, with the Bank's prior concurrence,&#13;
promptly revise the above Manual accordingly (para. 3.12);&#13;
(ii)  it will implement the Action Plan for the commercialization of the PTSIs&#13;
under the project (para 3.20);&#13;
(iii)  it will maintain a Steering Committee with the overall responsibility for&#13;
project implementation and policy guidance. The Steering Committee would be&#13;
chaired by BAPPENAS and consist of representatives of all implementing&#13;
agencies (MOI, BPPT and LIPI), MOF and the Indonesian Chamber of&#13;
Commerce and Industry. In addition, each implementing agency will maintain a&#13;
Project Management and Implementation Unit (PMIU) to undertake the day-to-&#13;
day implementation responsibilities of its respective project components. A&#13;
central PMIU, reporting to the above Steering Committee, will also be maintained&#13;
to coordinate the activities of the above PMIUs (para. 4.02);&#13;
(iv)  it will procure goods and services in accordance with the Bank guidelines&#13;
(paras. 4.05- 4.06);&#13;
(v)   it will submit an audit report for the project related accounts to the Bank&#13;
within six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 4.11);&#13;
(vi)  it will monitor and evaluate, on an ongoing basis and in accordance with&#13;
the agreed performance indicators, the implementation of the project (para. 4.13);&#13;
(vii)  the central PMIU will send progress reports to the Bank semi-annually&#13;
within two months after the end of each reporting period, beginning on June 30,&#13;
1996 (para. 4.13);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(viii) a mid-term evaluation of the project's performance will be conducted in&#13;
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, and the report on the&#13;
findings and recommendations of that review will be furnished to the Bank by&#13;
September 30, 1998 and would be reviewed by the Bank and GOI by November&#13;
1, 1998 (para 4.13); and&#13;
(ix)  it will submit to the Bank an Implementation Completion Report within&#13;
four months of the Closing Date of the Bank Loan (para 4.14).&#13;
6.02  During negotiations, GOI agreed that, as conditions of Loan disbursement, no&#13;
withdrawals shall be made in respect of:&#13;
(i)   DAPATI grants unless: the DAPATI Management Contract shall have&#13;
been entered into in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and the grant has been&#13;
made in accordance with the procedures set out in the DAPATI Implementation&#13;
Manual (para 3.12); and&#13;
(ii)  equipment and twinning arrangements required to implement the project&#13;
component for improved public R&amp;D management unless: the Ministry of&#13;
Finance shall have issued the necessary regulations and all other related&#13;
documentation satisfactory to the Bank required to implement the Action Plan for&#13;
the commercialization of the PTSIs (para 3.20).&#13;
6.03  With the above agreement and assurances, the proposed project constitutes a&#13;
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$47.0 million equivalent that would be repayable in&#13;
20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the standard variable interest rate.&#13;

MSTQ NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN INDONESIA&#13;
1.  Indonesian institutions responsible for MSTQ have made considerable progress in the past four&#13;
years. An identification mission in 1990 found that the various organizations responsible for Indonesia's&#13;
industrial standards systems while understanding basic principles, did not fully appreciate the impact of&#13;
MSTQ on technology transfer, exports, and competitiveness in the global economy. Like a number of&#13;
other emerging industrial economies at that time, Indonesia was starting to transition from an inward&#13;
focused "classical" MSTQ system to one which is more in tune with international and regional&#13;
considerations. These stages of evolution are illustrated here. Today it is evident that Indonesia is&#13;
emerging from that transition phase and is posed to provide requisite MSTQ services in support of&#13;
industrial technology development.&#13;

2.  It is evident that both the private and public sectors recognize that quality is a critical factor in&#13;
international competitiveness.  There is a better appreciation of the interrelationships between&#13;
metrology/calibration and quality; laboratory accreditation and product certification; quality and&#13;
calibration, and laboratory accreditation; and the standards for testing, accrediting, and certifying&#13;
products and service. Many Indonesian companies, however, believe that improved quality entails&#13;
increased costs. Domestic markets are cost-sensitive and not quality conscious. Manufacturers do not&#13;
appreciate how improving quality can reduce costs by increasing yields, reducing rejects, and improving&#13;
productivity.&#13;
&#13;

3.   Quality training services are limited to occasional short courses by the Indonesian Quality&#13;
Management Association, the Institute for Management Education and itinerant foreign trainers. A&#13;
reputed comprehensive quality management curriculum does not exist which would enable those assigned&#13;
to manage or supervise quality functions to acquire the broad range of quality training necessary for such&#13;
positions. A particularly challenging handicap is the lack of textbooks in Bahasa Indonesia on quality&#13;
management. Only one or two primers outlining ISO 9000 have been translated.&#13;
4.   As Indonesian MSTQ institutions transition to a more strategic MSTQ system with a global&#13;
outlook, efforts are underway to address the more significant impediments at the enterprise level and to&#13;
upgrade institutions to provide better support to the private sector. The results of recent World Bank,&#13;
German, and Japanese MSTQ assistance projects have been assimilated into well-grounded plans to&#13;
implement a comprehensive, cohesive national MSTQ system during Repelita VI. This five-year MSTQ&#13;
plan pragmatically addresses many needs and issues. As expected, considerable attention is focused on&#13;
equipping and upgrading calibration and testing laboratories, but the need for human resource&#13;
development, education, and effective management systems is also addressed. Specific tasks include&#13;
accrediting testing laboratories, and establishing a credible, internationally recognized calibration&#13;
network. Development of uniquely Indonesian standards is de-emphasized and resources are provided to&#13;
reorient standardization committees to adopt or adapt international standards. This is in tune with the&#13;
GATT/WTO accord on non-tariff  trade barriers which requires nations to give precedence to&#13;
international standards.&#13;
5.  ISO 9000 certification is also a major priority in Indonesia's MSTQ strategy. Less than fifty&#13;
Indonesian firms have been certified so far, and nearly all of those certifications took place abroad&#13;
because of the absence of an internationally recognized accreditation system, and the lack of qualified&#13;
assessors and consulting firms that could help firms implement ISO 9000 quality management systems.&#13;
Indonesia's strategy provides for implementation of a national system for registering lead assessors,&#13;
accrediting testing laboratories and improving the calibration of test equipment in Indonesia's public and&#13;
private labs.&#13;
6.   Within government, there are two main providers of MSTQ services to industry. The National&#13;
Metrology Center (KIM) is Indonesia's primary metrology center. One of its major tasks is to calibrate&#13;
the equipment of public and private sector testing laboratories throughout the country which is essential&#13;
for ensuring the accuracy of their testing equipment. Under the Industrial Technology Development&#13;
Project technical assistance would be provided for KIM--through a twinning arrangement with a leading&#13;
international metrology and calibration laboratory selected competitively using Bank guidelines--for&#13;
building its management and institutional capacity, including improvement of the technical proficiency of&#13;
KIM with the objective of gaining international recognition and accreditation, which is vital to&#13;
implementation of Indonesia's ISO 9000 certification program. The Ministry of Industry's Center for&#13;
Industrial Standards (PUSTAN) also has an important role to play in the implementation of the national&#13;
industrial standards system and ISO 9000 certification of industrial enterprises. Under the project,&#13;
PUSTAN would receive technical assistance to promote industry awareness of quality management&#13;
practices, including ISO 9000, and would initiate ISO 9000 certification of 40 SMIs as a pilot program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 3&#13;
7.   In addition to government providers of MSTQ services there is a small but growing number of&#13;
private sector providers in Indonesia.  As part of its MSTQ strategy GOI plans to improve the&#13;
participation of the private sector in the provision of all MSTQ support services, including ISO 90000&#13;
assessor and consulting services, and to have substantial private sector representation in the country's&#13;
main MSTQ policy making bodies and accreditation councils. The strategy calls for active involvement&#13;
of the private sector and competition between public and private service providers in the provision of&#13;
MSTQ services.&#13;
8.   Taking advantage of the present climate and building on previous technical assistance projects, the&#13;
MSTQ component of the ITDP will expedite action in priority areas identified in the Repelita VI Five-&#13;
Year Plan. Institutional upgrading will concentrate on improving managerial skills. Only a limited&#13;
amount of equipment will be procured, and that will be only where voids exist which would hinder&#13;
laboratory accreditation.&#13;
9.   The majority of the investment will be for private sector quality awareness and training with special&#13;
emphasis on small and medium enterprises. Outreach to SMIs will be accomplished through extension&#13;
agents working from eight MOI R&amp;D centers. To foster quality awareness and commitment by top&#13;
management, the experiences of a major private sector organization such as India's Confederation of&#13;
Engineering Industries, or the Singapore Manufacturers Association will be transferred to the Indonesian&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. A comprehensive quality implementation program will be initiated&#13;
that will serve as a model for other sectors. Rather than build a quality training arm within the Ministry&#13;
of Industry, PUSTAN will team with regional technical universities to provide a comprehensive range of&#13;
quality courses under license from a world-class training provider. The courses will be tailored to the&#13;
specific needs of Indonesian industry.&#13;
10.  The pragmatic initiatives of the MSTQ component will enable Indonesia to put into a place time-&#13;
critical institutional capabilities--a national calibration system, and a cadre of accredited testing&#13;
laboratories--and will encourage the private provision of MSTQ support services which are required for&#13;
the successful implementation of its Repelita VI Five-Year MSTQ plan.&#13;

The Market for Technology Services in Indonesia&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
Developing a vibrant and sustainable market for technology services in Indonesia is the&#13;
primary objective of the Technology Services Matching Grant Scheme. To determine the potential for&#13;
growth in the domestic technology services market, this section first describes the current level of&#13;
demand for different types of technology services in Indonesia and explains which service providers are&#13;
now supplying that expertise. Then the Bank's considerable international experience in the provision of&#13;
technology services through cost sharing schemes is reviewed and key success factors in the design of&#13;
these programs are highlighted. Lastly, these experiences are used to design 'the matching grant scheme&#13;
for providing technology services to small and medium-sized industries (SMIs) in Indonesia. The market&#13;
mechanism embodied in the matching grant scheme would allow firms to determine the future growth and&#13;
direction of the market for technology services in Indonesia.&#13;
II. Technology Services Market in Indonesia&#13;
Demand&#13;
Presently, demand for technology services among small and medium-sized firms in Indonesia&#13;
is weak as is the capacity of the domestic consulting industry to supply those services. Firms are&#13;
reluctant to use technology service providers because of concerns about value for money, confidentiality,&#13;
and their ability to identify a suitable expert and use them effectively. Demand for technology support&#13;
services in Indonesia is concentrated in large and some medium-sized firms. For many medium and large&#13;
firms, this demand is supplied primarily through contractual technology agreements with foreign joint-&#13;
venture partners, licensing arrangements, domestic and international consulting engagements, and&#13;
international contacts.&#13;
Indonesian SMIs seek technical support primarily from university institutes, government&#13;
laboratories, and their equipment vendors.  The services SMIs most often request are process and&#13;
product technology, calibration and testing, and new equipment integration. Recently, there has been&#13;
growing interest among firms to undertake training in IS09000 quality systems, however, the cost is seen&#13;
as prohibitive and only a few Indonesian firms have yet received certification. The TSGs' (Technology&#13;
Services Groups) experience under the Industrial Restructuring Project (LN 3040-IND) has shown that&#13;
there is a growing awareness among Indonesian small and medium-sized firms of the benefits of&#13;
technology management services (production planning and control) and a corresponding increase in their&#13;
demand for these services. The table on the next page shows the range of technology services which are&#13;
delivered to Indonesian firms (mostly larger firms) and which organizations are providing those services.&#13;

Supply&#13;
Suppliers of technology and management services include: about 3000 private sector&#13;
consulting firms; countless full and part-time individual consultants; and over 30 government laboratories&#13;
and technical institutes. There is as yet no evaluative information on the quality of service providers in&#13;
each of these categories, but anecdotal information suggests that there are only a few domestic&#13;
technology consulting firms perceived as being of international quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Firms report that local university institutes or govemment laboratories, which are the largest&#13;
service providers to SMIs, generally produce adequate quality and their prices are affordable. However,&#13;
fundamental problems exist within government laboratories and institutes. Delivery times are too long;&#13;
non-pribumi firms are not provided services; firms lack commercial access to testing and design&#13;
equipment in government laboratories (although university laboratories offer better access); there is no&#13;
transparency on cost of technology services; firms lack information on the types of technology services&#13;
available; and firms are largely unaware of the quality of individual service providers. The ITDP project&#13;
will address these problems through restructuring of selected laboratories, strengthening their&#13;
management processes, and assisting laboratories to commercialize their services and establish incentive&#13;
programs to motivate them to contract out their services to the private sector.&#13;
Indonesia's strength in technical support services is in design engineering of metals based&#13;
manufacturing. This expertise is centered in Bandung where institutes, universities and private consulting&#13;
services specialize in design engineering. For example, the Polytechnic Mechanical and the Academy of&#13;
Machine and Industrial Technology (ATMI) are located in Bandung, and international and domestic&#13;
consultants have concentrated their engineering design offices in this area.&#13;
Tlhe domestic private consulting industry has significant weaknesses. In general, consulting&#13;
firms lack conceptual planning and management skills. Their management skills need to be developed at&#13;
three levels: (i) the managers of consulting firms need training in internal management processes and&#13;
practices; (ii) individual consultants need training in management of consulting engagements; and (iii)&#13;
individual consultants need training in business management skills and quality management which could&#13;
be developed into a service to be offered to client firms. In addition, local consultants report that joint&#13;
engagements with international consulting firms to serve small and medium-sized industry have been&#13;
unsuccessful in transferring technical skills to the local consultants. The discrepancy between the skill&#13;
level of domestic and international firms is such that absorptive capacity is minimal.&#13;
The cost of technology service providers varies. Consulting firms' rates are relatively transparent since&#13;
client firms are aware of the BAPPENAS posted rates for consulting services. Firms use these rates to&#13;
bargain contracts with consultants. As an example, a local consultant with ten years of consulting&#13;
experience could be employed for up to Rp. 7.5 million per month (US$ 3,500); a comparable expatriate&#13;
consultant could earn US$ 17,500 per month in fees and expenses. Government laboratories and&#13;
institutes which undertake calibration and testing are unaware of how to price their services with the&#13;
result that services are often provided below cost. Experience with the TSGs shows that short duration&#13;
periodic consultancies are affordable for and provide benefits to SMIs. For instance, twenty days of in-&#13;
house local consulting visits spread over a two to three month period cost about US$ 5,000 to $8,000&#13;
and can provide substantial changes to firms' operations.&#13;

m. Past World Bank Experience with Cost Sharing Schemes&#13;
The matching grant scheme component proposed in this project is the latest in an evolving&#13;
series of cost sharing schemes which subsidize part of the cost of providing technical and management&#13;
advise to private sector firms. The fundamental tenet of these programs is that they are demand-led,&#13;
relying on the entrepreneur to define its needs (within the scope of the Program) and choose the service&#13;
provider which is best able to solve their technology problems. These initiatives evolved during the mid-&#13;
1980's, replacing the previous models of creating or subsidizing public sector agencies to provide&#13;
technology services to small- and medium-sized industries which, except for rare occasions, have proven&#13;
to be ineffective. Cost sharing programs have had a substantial impact on the competitiveness of&#13;
beneficiary firms. For example, under the Mauritius project (Ln. 3736-MAS) econormic benefits of 2 to I&#13;
are expected.&#13;
To date, eleven World Bank projects in South Asia, East Asia (including two in Indonesia),&#13;
Latin America and Africa have undertaken cost sharing schemes to enhance the quality and productivity&#13;
of domestic firms3. Originally, most of the cost sharing schemes were directed at exporting firms as part&#13;
of export development projects, and provided subsidies for productivity improvements, sales marketing,&#13;
and match making services, etc.. Increasingly, however, the focus is on productivity enhancement of&#13;
technology-based firms as part of a program to diffuse technology improvements to the firm-level,&#13;
regardless of whether the firm markets to the domestic or export markets. These programs have steadily&#13;
been upgraded to incorporate the lessons from earlier projects.&#13;
Key program success factors can be generalized across all of these projects.&#13;
a.    Recipient firms must have entrepreneurial drive, and government must take a hands off&#13;
approach. Firms want to drive the process. Direct government intervention would be viewed by&#13;
firms as business as usual. Successful programs leave it to the entrepreneurs to define their needs,&#13;
instead of offering a predetermined range of expertise.&#13;
b.    Firms must undertake a large share of the financial burden and take responsibility for managing&#13;
the consulting engagement. When firms contribute only a small share of the total cost of the&#13;
consultancy, the work is taken less seriously and management responsibilities fall upon the cost&#13;
sharing scheme.&#13;
3   For a more detailed review of cost sharing schemes in Bank Projects, see Staff Appraisal Report, Republic of Mauritius, Technical&#13;
Assistance to Enhance Competitiveness Project (LN 3736-MAS), Annex 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
c.    The subsidy element should be phased out during the life of the project. The growth and&#13;
sustainability of the market for technology services requires recipient and non-recipient firms to be&#13;
willing to pay full price for consulting services by the end of the project. This can only be&#13;
accomplished by phasing out the subsidy element over time and heavily marketing the resultant&#13;
benefits to non-recipient firms and industrial organizations during and at the completion of the&#13;
project.&#13;
d.    Early emphasis on program marketing and pipeline development is crucial to attracting firms to&#13;
the program and achieving targeted grant disbursement levels.&#13;
e.    Administrative/approval procedures must be efficient and transparent. Responsiveness to firms'&#13;
needs is key to attracting and developing firms' long-term interest in using technology service&#13;
providers. In particular, the payment procedures to reimburse firms or pay the matching grant&#13;
portion to service providers, who generally don't have excess cashflow, must be quick and non-&#13;
bureaucratic.&#13;
1V. Tailoring the Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
The design of the matching grant scheme is intended to generate successful consultancy&#13;
projects which demonstrate to non-recipient Indonesian SMIs the economic benefits of using technology&#13;
service providers, thereby developing a sustainable demand for technology services. Once the demand is&#13;
created and firms are willing to pay for the services, international experience has shown that both the&#13;
quality and quantity of service providers will develop to meet the demand. To develop the market for&#13;
technology services in Indonesia lessons learned from previous World Bank experience have been&#13;
incorporated and tailored to the realities of the Indonesian business environment.  Specifically, the&#13;
matching grant scheme was designed with the following elements:&#13;
a.    A private sector management contractor (MC) would have full responsibility for the day-to-day&#13;
management of the matching grant scheme.  The principal functions of the management&#13;
contractor would be the promotion and marketing of the scheme, the administration and&#13;
disbursement of matching grants, and assistance to Indonesian SMIs in sourcing and use of&#13;
technology expertise. Government's intervention occurs at the policy level of the matching grant&#13;
scheme in designing acceptance criteria, approval of projects over $50,000, and evaluation of MC&#13;
performance. Direct government contact with SMIs is as a public sector technology service&#13;
provider competing for firms' appointment as consultant. The benefits of using an autonomous&#13;
management contractor to facilitate the scheme are that: neither private nor public sector service&#13;
providers would be favored during the consultant selection process, no permanent institution is&#13;
created that requires government budgetary funding after project implementation is completed,&#13;
and the MC experience as a consultant is beneficial to training service providers and interacting&#13;
with private sector firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
b. In order to increase firms' appreciation of the full value of the consultants' services and to&#13;
encourage firms' responsibility for managing the consulting engagement, the SMIs are requiled to&#13;
pay 50% of the cost of the first consulting engagement, increasing their contribution to 75% and&#13;
100% upon subsequent engagements under the scheme. This is far higher than under previous&#13;
projects in Indonesia. Under the Industrial Restructuring Project (Loan 3040-rND) ) firms'&#13;
maximum contribution was 10% of consultancy costs, and under the Second Export Development&#13;
Project (Loan 2979-IND) firms' contributed only 25% towards the costs of the initial&#13;
consultancy.&#13;
c.    Marketing efforts to build an initial pipeline are the priority of the management contractor during&#13;
the initial project stages, and prior to hiring the MC, the Technical Supervisory Committee would&#13;
undertake this role, including marketing the scheme to industry associations which could identify&#13;
group consultancies that would benefit their member firms.&#13;
d.    Administrative processing should be rapid since grant approval on applications below US$ 50,000&#13;
is made only by the management contractor, and for the same size project approval of consultant&#13;
deliverables is made only by the firm and the management contractor.&#13;
e.    The flow of funds under the scheme would reduce the time it takes to pay service providers upon&#13;
satisfactory completion of the consultancy and reduce the scope for corruption.&#13;
f     Standardized technology services such as IS09000 training would be offered to groups of firms in&#13;
order to reduce the overall cost to individual firms.&#13;
g.    Preregistration of service providers would include a two to three day training in consulting skills.&#13;
Technology service providers would be allowed to receive funding from the matching grant&#13;
scheme (on a 50% cost sharing basis) in order to upgrade the quality of their consulting services.&#13;
Group seminars on management topics could also be funded through the matching grant scheme.&#13;
h.    The size of the matching grant scheme has been reduced to reflect Bank experience in discharging&#13;
contracts under similar cost sharing schemes and to prevent the cancellation of grant funds during&#13;
project implementation. US$ 6 million would be available for grants which would be matched&#13;
with US$ 6 million from recipient firms. Potentially, 3000 to 4000 SMIs4 in Agro-based and&#13;
Engineering Industries in Indonesia could be developed into an active market for technology&#13;
support services. However, the volume and nature of consultancy services required by these firms&#13;
is unknown at present. Estimates of the number of contracts during the matching grant scheme's&#13;
four-year operation are based on anticipated administrative capacity of the program officers to&#13;
discharge projects. It was assumed that the scheme could discharge 20 contracts (or about 3 per&#13;
field representative) per month of operation during the life of the program and that average&#13;
4   Based on data provided in the Indonesia: Industrial Sector Development Report and the Indonesia: Competition Policy: Industrial&#13;
Competitiveness and Effects of Deregulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
contract size would be US$ 12,000. This results in a contract volume of 1000 and a total&#13;
contract value of US$ 12 million.&#13;
i.    The matching grant scheme would be marketed to small and medium-sized firms which cannot&#13;
rely on foreign firms or domestic conglomerates to supply their technology needs. Large firms&#13;
and firms with operating agreements with foreign firms already have access to technical expertise&#13;
and financing, and cottage industry firms are probably too small to absorb their share of&#13;
consultancy costs (however, they would not be excluded from the matching grant scheme). GOI&#13;
has determined that the matching grant scheme would be marketed to Engineering Industries&#13;
(ISIC 38), e.g. metal working, electronics, machinery, and motorized vehicles, etc., and Agro-&#13;
based Industries (ISIC 31, 32, 33, 34, 35), e.g. food, leather, wood, paper and rubber, etc.&#13;
because these sectors are expected to be large sources of export growth with additional&#13;
technological development.&#13;
j.    Consultant price negotiations would be carried out competitively between the service providers&#13;
and SMIs. Payment from the Bank loan of the matching portion of the cost of services would be&#13;
based on Bappenas benchmark prices; additional fees and cost overruns would be borne by the&#13;
beneficiary.&#13;
k.    The Technology Service Matching Grant Scheme is the first program which encourages&#13;
competition among public and private service providers by marketing to and preregistering public&#13;
service providers. Past cost sharing schemes have focused solely on using private sector&#13;
consultants to meet the needs of firms.&#13;

CHAPTER 1: DAPATI OVERVIEW, OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1   The Technology Services Matching Grant Scheme forms a key component of the Industrial&#13;
Technology Development (ITD) Project, which is intended to facilitate the development,&#13;
dissemination and adoption of improved technologies by small and medium scale industries in&#13;
Indonesia. The Bahasa Indonesia name for the program is Dana Kemitraan Peningkatan Teknologi&#13;
Industri, and will be referred to by its acronym DAPATI in this manual.  Other related&#13;
components include measures to increase the quantity, quality and market orientation of R&amp;D and&#13;
technology services provided by Government research institutes, and strengthening the system of&#13;
industrial metrology, standards, testing and quality assurance services.&#13;
1.2   The purpose of the DAPATI program is to provide direct financial support to small and medium&#13;
scale firms (SMIs) to upgrade their use of technology and as necessary to introduce related&#13;
management improvements. The central tenet of the Program is that it is demand led. Firms are&#13;
given support, principally in the form of a cost sharing grant, to obtain technology and business&#13;
services from specialist suppliers. These suppliers may be private consultants (local or&#13;
international, individual or part of a firm) or publicly sponsored technology services. The firm is&#13;
allowed to choose the service it requires (within the scope of the Program) and the supplier. In&#13;
addition to a cost sharing grant, support provided to the firm, if requested, includes assistance to&#13;
identify priority problems and opportunities which could benefit from obtaining external expertise,&#13;
help to make best use of the consultancy services (for example, preparation of detailed terms of&#13;
reference for the consultancy, including specification of costs and required output), and help to&#13;
identify suitable consultants.&#13;
1.3   DAPATI also provides support to improve the quality of consultancy available in Indonesia, and&#13;
to ensure firms receive assistance under the Program only from properly qualified consultants, in&#13;
two main ways:&#13;
*     the DAPATI Management Contractor will provide a short training course on consulting&#13;
skills for all consultants wanting to operate under the program, plus related registration of&#13;
specialist consultants&#13;
*     groups of service providers (consultants) may use DAPATI funds on a 50/50 cost sharing&#13;
basis, to conduct seminars on manufacturing technology and technology management&#13;
topics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 5 of 33&#13;
1.4   The types of consultancy which can be assisted by the Program cover improvements in:&#13;
*     product or process technologies, quality and reliability;&#13;
*     productivity;&#13;
*     safety and environmental impact; and&#13;
*     management control of technical operations.&#13;
A full list of qualifying activities is provided in paragraph 4.4.&#13;
1.5   DAPATI provides assistance for consultancy support only. It does not cover the cost of acquiring&#13;
plant and equipment, even if this is directly related to the consultancy.&#13;
OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED RESULTS&#13;
1.6 The primary objectives of DAPATI are to:&#13;
-     enhance the international competitiveness of SMIs in Indonesia&#13;
*     improve the access of SMIs to know how in the development and use of more advanced&#13;
technologies&#13;
*     improve firm level productivity, product quality, design and response times&#13;
*     encourage SMIs to grow into higher value added and export oriented production&#13;
*     to improve the capabilities of SMIs to act as suppliers to large firms in Indonesia.&#13;
1.7   In support of these primary objectives there are three secondary objectives specific to the services&#13;
available through DAPATI:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
ANNEX 1 1&#13;
Page 6 of 33&#13;
*     to encourage SMIs to use extemal expertise where appropriate to help overcome&#13;
constraints to competitiveness&#13;
*     to improve linkages between firms and publicly and privately sponsored technology&#13;
services&#13;
*     to increase the quantity and quality of technical and related management consultancy&#13;
services available in Indonesia.&#13;
1.8   DAPATI will address these objectives by providing cost sharing grants to SMIs to help them&#13;
obtain technology services, and by providing training for the service providers. Expected results&#13;
include:&#13;
*     improvements in SMIs' productivity and product quality and reliability, and consequent&#13;
increases in revenues and profitability.&#13;
*     a substantial increase in the number and quality of technology support services available to&#13;
and affordable by SMIs in Indonesia.&#13;
i     a greater willingness of SMIs to use consulting services in future at full market costs. The&#13;
increase in both demand and supply beyond the period of the program therefore secures&#13;
long term benefits in the availability and use of support services.&#13;
RATIONALE&#13;
1.9   The rationale for DAPATI is as follows. SMIs frequently need assistance from experts outside the&#13;
firm to upgrade their use of technology and to achieve substantial benefits from this process.&#13;
However, most SMIs are also reluctant to use outsiders for a variety of reasons, including&#13;
concems about confidentiality, value for money, and their ability to identify a suitable expert and&#13;
to use them effectively.&#13;
1.10  A cost sharing grant can significantly reduce this initial barrier to using technology services.&#13;
Exposure to these services, properly conceived and delivered, increases SMIs willingness and&#13;
ability to use them in future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
ANNEX I 1&#13;
Page 7 of33&#13;
1.11   Public and private sector technology services often compete for the same SMI market. The&#13;
purpose of DAPATI is not to favor one sector or the other, but to give firms a choice of which&#13;
provider to use. Training for consultants, an integral part of DAPATI, will also be equally&#13;
available to public and private sector service providers.&#13;
1.12  Previous work by the Bank and others in Indonesia confirms that the above rationale is applicable&#13;
here. Most SMIs are not inclined to use outside specialists, but frequently they need assistance to&#13;
improve productivity and product quality, and better use of existing plant and equipment.&#13;
1.13  However, the consultancy sector is poorly developed in Indonesia. Private sector consultants&#13;
serve mainly large firms, and few have all the skills and experience appropriate for SMIs. In the&#13;
public sector, the technology service organizations are not demand driven, nor in most cases are&#13;
they used to providing consultancy services on commercial terms. Nevertheless, experience of the&#13;
Technical Service Groups, supported by a previous World Bank loan, indicates that there is&#13;
demand for technical services among SMIs provided the right approach is taken and quality&#13;
services are available. The Export Support Board Matching Grant Program also demonstrates the&#13;
usefulness of cost sharing grants to stimulate demand for services.&#13;

CHAPTER 2: SCALE AND SCOPE OF DAPATI&#13;
COST SHARING GRANT FUNDING AND TIMING&#13;
2.1   The DAPATI program will run for five years or until the funds in the program have been&#13;
depleted. Prior to the start it is expected that some awareness marketing will be undertaken by&#13;
the DAPATI Supervisory Commnittee, industry associations and consulting associations.&#13;
However, it is likely that there will be a period of several weeks at the beginning of the contract&#13;
when the main focus will be on familiarization of DAPATI team, production of a marketing plan,&#13;
development of administrative systems, and preparation of the necessary documentation. The&#13;
build up of projects is therefore likely to be gradual.&#13;
2.2   The total funds available for DAPATI will be US$8.2 million of which: US$2.0m will be required&#13;
to cover administrative costs, US$6m will be available to support technology consulting services&#13;
to firms, and US$200,000 will be reserved for seminars for services providers. The amount&#13;
available assumes that a minimum of 600 consultancy contracts will be grant assisted over the&#13;
duration of the Program, at an average size of US$12,000 each and with an average of 50 percent&#13;
of the contract costs covered by grant (the remaining 50 percent to be paid by firms). It is&#13;
assumed that on average 20 consultancy projects will be supported each month of the Program.&#13;
The amount available for seminars assumes that eight seminars are conducted at a cost of&#13;
US$50,000 each, of which 50 percent will be paid by the grant.&#13;
2.3   Contract costs are likely to vary substantially depending on the length and complexity of the&#13;
consultancy required and whether local or international consultants are used. There will be a limit&#13;
of US$50,000 on the total grant aid that can be disbursed to projects for any one firm, but the&#13;
cost of individual contracts, provided they fall within this limit, will be subject to negotiation&#13;
between firm and consultant. The management contractor (the organization responsible for&#13;
administration of DAPATI) will only intervene if the charges proposed by the consultant appear&#13;
to be in excess of BAPPENAS rates for similar contracts. The proportion of total costs which are&#13;
covered by grant will also vary depending on the location of the firm and number of contracts&#13;
which the firm has had funded by DAPATI previously. A maximum of three projects will be&#13;
eligible for grant aid, and no more than one for each type of service.&#13;
2.4   It is assumed that expenditure on grant assistance will increase steadily during the five year&#13;
project. The number of firms taking up their first consultancy contracts under DAPATI should&#13;
increase quickly over the first year, then more gradually. Later in the Program a higher proportion&#13;
of projects is likely to be repeat contracts for firms, although because of the declining proportion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
ANNEX I I&#13;
Page 9 of 33&#13;
of grant aid available for repeat contracts the total disbursement for repeats is likely to remain&#13;
below that on new contracts.&#13;
2.5   The main administrative costs will include:&#13;
*     salaries and related overheads of the Management Contractor&#13;
*     the cost of running DAPATI offices in Jakarta and regional centres, including rent, equipment,&#13;
vehicles, travel and communications, and administrative and secretarial support&#13;
*     promotion and marketing of DAPATI&#13;
*     mid term and final DAPATI reviews&#13;
-     annual financial audits of DAPATI.&#13;
2.6    Administrative costs will decline over the duration of the project for three main reasons: initial&#13;
setting up costs will add to base expenditure in the first year; the number of expatriate staff&#13;
involved in running DAPATI will reduce as the management contractor's local staff take over&#13;
management functions: and marketing costs will decline as the Program becomes well known and&#13;
consultants increasingly market the program direct to firms.&#13;
2.7   The key assumptions used to estimate administrative expenditures concern staffing, the number of&#13;
regional offices, the support provided by Government and KADIN, and the phasing of Program&#13;
implementation. It is assumed that there will be five offices in addition to Jakarta: in Bandung,&#13;
Medan, Surabaya, Ujung Pandang and Semarang. It is also assumed (for budgeting purposes)&#13;
that the Program Manager will be an expatriate for the first 18 months of the Program and&#13;
thereafter the locally-recruited Deputy Manager would take over as Program Manager.&#13;
COST SHARING GRANT TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#13;
2.8  The proportion of total contract costs covered by grant aid will vary as follows (see table 2.1):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
ANNEX lI&#13;
Page 10 of 33&#13;
*  the highest level of grant aid will be 75 percent, payable for first projects undertaken outside&#13;
Java. For the second and third projects undertaken outside Java grant aid will be 50 percent&#13;
and 25 percent respectively of eligible expenditure. Within Java grant aid will be 50 percent of&#13;
the first project, 25 percent for the second, and zero thereafter&#13;
* the cash limit on total grant aid which can be paid for projects for one firm will be US$50,000.&#13;
2.9   The DAPATI is available to all SMIs (industries with annual sales less than Rp. 2 billion) in the&#13;
manufacturing sector and also to groups of consultants registered with DAPATI in order to&#13;
upgrade the quality of their services. Within this overall limitation, there will be no differences in&#13;
the proportion of grant aid payable by size of firm.&#13;

(2)  Firm's second contract supported by DAPATI&#13;
(3)  Firm's third contract supported by DAPATI&#13;
No financial support is available after the third contract, but firms may receive&#13;
assistance in locating and brokering technical services from DAPATI.&#13;
2.10  Also, no restrictions are proposed on access to DAPATI grants for firms in different&#13;
manufacturing sub-sectors nor are DAPATI grants to be allocated among industries. Grants are&#13;
approved on a first-come first-served basis to qualified firms.  Marketing of the Program,&#13;
however, would be directed at certain industries. Initially it is proposed that marketing should&#13;
target SMIs in the engineering and agro-based industries (ISIC 31, 32, 33, 35, 37 and 38).&#13;
Projects in any case should be aimed at development of exports and/or technology upgrading.&#13;
2.11   Further guidance on targeted marketing may be provided by the DAPATI Supervisory Committee&#13;
during the project. However, no further limitations on access to the Program are envisaged.&#13;

Bahasa Indonesia, have at least three years experience of operating as a management consultant,&#13;
be independent of influence from interested parties, and have a focus on technology and SMI&#13;
consulting. Ideally the contractor should also have experience of cost sharing grant or similar SMI&#13;
support programs operated elsewhere. The Contractor should have a separate legal identity,&#13;
preferably in the form of a corporation. The Contractor should be a non-bank institution and be&#13;
privately owned (i.e. greater than 50 percent private ownership).&#13;
Service providers&#13;
3.10  Service providers, or consultants, wishing to operate under the Program must first register with&#13;
the Management Contractor. Registration will involve a pre-qualification process, including a&#13;
short training program in consultancy skills.&#13;
3.11  Exemption from the training program can only be given by the DAPATI Management Contractor&#13;
or if a firm selects the consultant directly. In the case of direct selection, the Contractor may still&#13;
insist that the consultant undertakes the training program, either before starting on the project or&#13;
subsequently, if it is felt necessary.&#13;
3.12  In order to ensure that consultants operating under the Program are suitably qualified and&#13;
experienced, only individuals can register as DAPATI consultants. They may be freelance&#13;
consultants, employees of a consultancy firm, a non-profit foundation, or of publicly sponsored&#13;
organizations such as R&amp;D Institutes, technical laboratories, universities and technical colleges.&#13;
Both local and foreign consultants may operate under the program.&#13;
3.13   Remuneration of consultants under the Program will be subject to agreement with the firm. The&#13;
Management Contractor will only intervene if the fee proposed by the consultant and agreed by&#13;
the firm is in excess of BAPPENAS recommended rates for a similar project and level of&#13;
consultancy experience. In this case grant aid will be paid in relation to the BAPPENAS rates&#13;
rather than the actual contracted fee for the project. This must be made clear to both the firm and&#13;
the consultant before commencement of the project.&#13;

3. 14  Consultants must act within the terms and spirit of the Program or they will be removed from the&#13;
register. Registration does not guarantee contracts under DAPATI. Consultants will be expected&#13;
to market their services directly to firms, and cannot expect assistance from the Management&#13;
Contractor except in awareness marketing, and as requested in negotiating reasonable terms and&#13;
conditions for consultancy projects, and to help resolve disputes between firrns and consultant.&#13;
Industries&#13;
3.15  Firms wishing to obtain grant aid for consultancy projects must apply to the DAPATI&#13;
Management Contractor and provide all necessary documentation, including:&#13;
a completed application form accompanied, if requested, by the Management Contractor,&#13;
the proof of financial viability (e.g. a bank statement, audited financial statements or&#13;
similar independent verification that the firm is able to pay for and benefit from the&#13;
consultancy project)&#13;
defined deliverables, which provide proof to the Management Contractor that the&#13;
consultancy project has been completed satisfactorily. Grant can only be paid after the&#13;
Contractor has received, and/or approved, the defined deliverables. Deliverables must be&#13;
defined in the terms of reference for the consultancy project and in the tripartite contract&#13;
between the firm, the consultant, the PIMPRO and the Management Contractor. Examples&#13;
of deliverables include a report recommending measures to improve productivity, a quality&#13;
manual, a revised plant layout, or installation and satisfactory operation of new equipment&#13;
proof of payment of the consultant's fees and expenses. Payment of DAPATI grant&#13;
money is only permissible after the SMI has fully paid their portion of contract costs. The&#13;
SMI's cost sharing portion can only be paid in cash, not in kind.&#13;
3.16  To enable the Management Contractor to undertake the role effectively, both firms and&#13;
consultants must allow reasonable access to the project by the Contractor. Firms should also co-&#13;
operate with the Management Contractor to allow collection of evidence of benefits derived from&#13;
the* consultancy project, within six to 12 months of its completion. As far as practicable,&#13;
measurable expected benefits should also be defined in the terms of reference and contract.&#13;

Government&#13;
3.17  Government's main responsibilities are:&#13;
to appoint and assign management responsibility for DAPATI to the DAPATI Supervisory&#13;
Committee and the Management Contractor&#13;
to appoint and assign a DIP Project Manager (PIMPRO) to review and sign the contracts&#13;
between beneficiary and service provider for the purposes of verifying availability of&#13;
project funds to cover the grant payment to the service provider and facilitate payment to&#13;
service provider of DAPATI grant portion&#13;
to commission from an independent source mid term and end of project evaluations of the&#13;
impact of DAPATI on firms and (separately) on local consultants&#13;
to monitor performance of the Management Contractor, and if necessary to terminate the&#13;
contract and re-appoint.&#13;
3.18  The Government is also responsible for setting up the overall ITD Project Implementation Unit.&#13;
TRAINING PROGRAMS&#13;
3.19  Training programs will be developed by the Management Contractor for consultants wishing to&#13;
register as consultancy assistants under the Program. The training programs will be two to three&#13;
days and will focus on consultancy rather than technical skills. All consultants will be expected to&#13;
participate in the training in order to register to offer services under the Program. Exemptions can&#13;
only be granted by the DAPATI Management Contractor, or in case a consultant with appropriate&#13;
qualifications and experience has already been selected by a firm to undertake a specific project.&#13;
In the latter case other formalities of registration (completion of the standard form) will still need&#13;
to be completed.&#13;
3.20 No charges should be made for the training. Costs will be covered by DAPATI.&#13;

3.21   The DAPATI forms part of the ITD Project. The flow of funds into DAPATI is therefore subject&#13;
to the overall financial management of the ITD project. A summary of the process is provided in&#13;
Appendix C.&#13;
3.22  Funds for DAPATI will reside in the ITD Project Special Account established by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. The government's standard reimbursement procedure will be followed in paying the&#13;
matching grant portion to the service providers upon completion of consultancy.  It is the&#13;
Management Contractor's responsibility to inform the implementing agency on an annual basis the&#13;
forecast level of disbursements.&#13;
3.23  Payment of grant aid will be made from the Special Account directly to the bank of the service&#13;
provider upon receipt of an invoice for the approved amount and proof of satisfactory completion&#13;
of the project (or stage, in the case of staged payments).&#13;
DATABASES&#13;
3.24  The Management Contractor will be responsible for establishment and maintenance of a database&#13;
of consultants. With the assistance of BPPT and Ministry of Industry, the Contractor will also&#13;
obtain access to national and international databases on relevant technologies and technical&#13;
support services. Access to information from these databases will be marketed to firms as a&#13;
feature of DAPATI. The Management Contractor should not be expected to pay to use databases&#13;
already accessed or maintained by BPPT or MOI.&#13;

CHAPTER 4: CRITERIA FOR DAPATI PARTICIPATION&#13;
QUALIFICATION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
4.1   Service providers, which are individual consultants, consulting firms, or public sector service&#13;
providers, must register as individuals and must meet pre-determined criteria regarding&#13;
qualifications and experience. The public service providers (institutes, universities, laboratories,&#13;
etc.) will register their staff who will directly be in charge of engagements with the private sector&#13;
firm. A standard form for application to register as a consultant will be provided by the&#13;
Management Contractor.&#13;
4.2   Firms may use only registered consultants. In case a firm wants to use a consultant not registered&#13;
on the Program, the consultant must first provide the Management Contractor with sufficient&#13;
information for them to assess capability and approve registration. Consultants registered in this&#13;
way need not undertake the standard training program, provided their performance on the&#13;
contracted project is satisfactory or unless the Management Contractor considei-s it essential to&#13;
improve the consultants capability prior to starting the project. There are two reasons for this&#13;
exemption: first, it encourages consultants to market DAPATI direct to firms; second, the&#13;
Program is intended to be demand led - if firms want to use a particular consultant the Program&#13;
should not cause delays provided the Contractor is satisfied the consultant can undertake the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
QUALIFICATION OF FIRMS&#13;
4.3    To qualify for grant aid under the Program firms must be:&#13;
privately owned: i.e. with over 50 percent of the equity privately owned&#13;
small or medium scale, as defined by annual sales of less than two billion rupiah&#13;
*     manufacturers or providers of support services to manufacturers, particularly those&#13;
industries categorized under ISIC code 31, 32, 33, 35, 37 and 38, or other manufacturers&#13;
in export or technology based industries, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97-&#13;
ANNEX l1&#13;
Page 19 of 33&#13;
*     consultants specializing in provision of technology services&#13;
*     based in Indonesia. Projects must also be located in Indonesia.&#13;
QUALIFYING ACTIVITIES&#13;
4.4   Qualifying activities are mainly in plant/ shop floor technical services including:&#13;
*     identification and application of improved process or product technologies&#13;
*     assistance to improve manufacturing process technology&#13;
*     assistance to improve product quality and reliability, and where appropriate to adopt&#13;
recognized standards&#13;
*     improvement to the efficiency and safety of plant layout, e.g., flow of material, material&#13;
handling systems&#13;
*     assistance for identification and application of energy saving, pollution prevention and&#13;
recycling technologies&#13;
*     testing and calibration services&#13;
*     preventative maintenance operations&#13;
production control and quality management, e.g., work measurement, line-balancing,&#13;
production scheduling, inventory control, total quality management&#13;
*     training of shop floor employees in above-mentioned topics&#13;

training seminars for consultants to improve their capabilities to deliver the above services&#13;
to SMIs, e.g., flexible manufacturing, production engineering&#13;
4.5   Consultancy projects are intended to provide specialist assistance to address specific problems.&#13;
Long term (e.g. over three months) secondment of staff to firms is not therefore regarded as a&#13;
qualifying activity.&#13;
QUALIFYING EXPENDITURES&#13;
4.6   Qualifying expenditures include all fees and expenses necessarily incurred in undertaking the&#13;
defined consultancy project and for which reimbursement is specifically provided in the contract&#13;
between the firm, the consultant, the PIMPRO and the Management Contractor. Expenses may be&#13;
included in a fixed fee agreement or charged separately, and on submission of receipts for all&#13;
significant expenditures (long distance travel, hotels, etc.). Payment from the Bank loan of the&#13;
matching portion of the cost of services would be based on BAPPENAS benchmark prices;&#13;
additional fees and cost overruns would be borne by the beneficiary.&#13;
4.7   No grant aid can be provided for expenditure on equipment (even if the equipment is necessary to&#13;
undertake the project), staff salaries or recurrent expenditure incurred by the consultant (e.g. on&#13;
office costs).&#13;
Grant can only be paid on proof of satisfactory completion of the consultancy project or&#13;
appropriate portion of the consultancy project, which will be required in all cases. Terms of&#13;
payment is shown in Table 4.1 below.&#13;

CHAPTER 5: OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF DAPATI&#13;
5.1    Appendix B describes the main steps in operation of DAPATI. From the perspective of the firm&#13;
these are:&#13;
*     Initial informal approach to the Management Contractor, to identify possibilities, issues,&#13;
etc.&#13;
*     Business diagnosis, provided free of charge by the Management Contractor at the request&#13;
of the firm&#13;
*     Identification and selection of suitable consultant(s), with the assistance of the&#13;
Management Contractor if requested&#13;
*     Preparation of terms of reference&#13;
Formal application and approval&#13;
Issuance of a contract between the firm, the consultant, the PIMPRO, and the&#13;
Management Contractor, specifying inputs, outputs (including defined deliverables), fees&#13;
and expenses, work program and payment schedule.&#13;
Consultancy services, including staged payments for intermediate outputs if appropriate&#13;
and related applications for payment of grant&#13;
*  .  Completion of consultancy services, including presentation by the consultant of the&#13;
defined deliverable(s)&#13;
*     Application for payment of grant&#13;
*     Cross check by Management Contractor of receipt by firm of defined deliverables and&#13;
firm's payment of consultant as specified&#13;

*     Monitoring of impact by Management Contractor.&#13;
5.2   Not all these stages are essential in every project: for example, firms may select the consultant&#13;
themselves and there may be no staged payments for smaller or short duration projects.&#13;
However, the above sequence indicates the steps through which projects proceed from conception&#13;
to completion and evaluation.&#13;

CHAPTER 6: SUSTAINABILITY OF RESULTS AND WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY OF RESULTS&#13;
6.1   Sustainability of results can be achieved in two main ways: the long term benefits to firms of&#13;
specific projects; and an increase in the willingness of firms to use specialist experts at full market&#13;
rates after completion of DAPATI, combined with an improvement in the quality and quantity of&#13;
that expertise.&#13;
6.2   The long term impact of specific projects will be measured as part of the Program in two ways:&#13;
monitoring of impact after six to 12 months, undertaken by the Management Contractor as part of&#13;
the contract on the proiect, and the mid term and end of Program evaluations by Government of&#13;
overall impacts.&#13;
6.3   Impacts will be measured primarily in relation to the objectives of each project, but also in more&#13;
general terms, including increased sales, export performance of participating firms, improved&#13;
productivity, and improved links between large firms in Indonesia and SMls due to improvements&#13;
in the latter's product quality and delivery performance.&#13;
6.4   The willingness of firms to use outside experts at full market rates after completion of DAPATI&#13;
depends on the success of DAPATI in stimulating development of an active market, rather than an&#13;
institutional framework, for technology support services. Development of the market is to be&#13;
supported by stimulating demand through the cost sharing grant and simultaneously improving the&#13;
quantity and quality of supply through registration and training of consultants. The Management&#13;
Contractor will be appointed for a fixed five year term (with annual review) to administer the&#13;
Program. The Contractor delivers no support services itself, nor is it intended to create a&#13;
permanent institution to continue beyond the five year program.&#13;
6.5   Beneficiary firms will be expected to pay full market rates for consultancy services after&#13;
completion of DAPATI. Experience of similar programs elsewhere suggests that the&#13;
demonstration effect of successful projects, together with the declining level of subsidy available&#13;
through DAPATI, should be sufficient to persuade firms to pay market rates subsequently.&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 24 of 33&#13;
WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS&#13;
Grant application approval&#13;
6.6   The first five grant applications submitted must be reviewed and approved by the World Bank to&#13;
ensure proper procedures are being followed. Thereafter, contracts in excess of US$50,000 in&#13;
value must be approved by the World Bank.&#13;
Internal reporting arrangements&#13;
6.7   A hierarchy of authority will be established, with reporting requirements defined at each level - the&#13;
firm, the Management Contractor, the Executing Agency (acting on behalf of the Government),&#13;
DAPATI Supervisory Committee, the ITD Project Steering Committee and the World Bank.&#13;
6.8    At the level of the firm, it will be necessary to produce proof of payment and of receipt of defined&#13;
deliverables before the grant proportion of the total fee can be paid to the consultant. Details of&#13;
projects a:e solely a matLer betwecn the firm, the consultant and the Contractor. It is essential that&#13;
business confidences are maintained and no disclosures are made to other parties, including the&#13;
DAPATI Supervisory Committee, without the written permission of the firm. The firm will be the&#13;
sole owner of all intellectual property arising from projects funded under DAPATI.&#13;
6.9   At the next level in the hierarchy, the Management Contractor will be required to report to&#13;
DAPATI Supervisory Committee as follows:&#13;
on a monthly basis, summarizing the characteristics of applications and approvals, and&#13;
reporting on overall progress&#13;
*     six monthly, on a more formal basis, providing information on: the number and size&#13;
(money value and man days of consultancy) of approvals by region, sector and size of&#13;
firm; rejections, listed by region, sector and reason for rejection; projects completed and in&#13;
the pipeline; impacts of completed projects (where assessments have been completed);&#13;
grant payments, including average and range of time taken to disburse money; marketing&#13;
activities undertaken and planned; operating costs vs. budget, by item; and other matters&#13;
concerning progress with the Program in each regional center and overall.&#13;
6.10  The six monthly reporting schedule will fit into the planned schedule of annual ITD Project&#13;
implementation reviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 25 of 33&#13;
6.11  The Management Contractor will take instructions only from  the DAPATI Supervisory&#13;
Committee. No other organization may invoke powers directly over the Program or the&#13;
Contractor.&#13;
6.12  The DAPATI Supervisory Committee will have overall responsibility for DAPATI, and will&#13;
report six monthly to the Executing Agency on progress. These reports will be based on the&#13;
Management Contractor's monitoring reports, with additional information, including minutes of&#13;
Committee meetings, and commentary provided by the Committee as they see fit. The Committee&#13;
should report on any concerns expressed by the Management Contractor in operating the&#13;
program, particularly in relation to prompt disbursement of grant moneys and the role of&#13;
Government Departments (e.g. in providing temporary work permits to foreign consultants), and&#13;
action taken to address these concerns.&#13;
6.13  The Executing Agency will pass on to the Bank the monitoring reports prepared by the&#13;
Management Contractor and DAPATI Supervisory Committee, as part of the overall monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the ITD Project. Bank Missions will review progress with the Executing&#13;
Agency, DAPATI Supervisory Committee and the Management Contractor at regular intervals&#13;
during the Project.&#13;
Public reporting&#13;
6.14  In addition to the above reporting arrangements which are internal to the ITD Project, DAPATI&#13;
Supervisory Committee will make available to the press every six months a summary of progress&#13;
on DAPATI, including the number, value and regional distribution of projects funded under the&#13;
Program, and information on impacts where available. No information on individual firms or&#13;
consultants, or on specific projects, will be divulged to the press wiThout the express permission&#13;
of the firm.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
6.15  Mid term and final evaluations of DAPATI will be commissioned by the Executing Agency from&#13;
independent sources. The Program will be evaluated in relation to its objectives and impacts on&#13;
SMIs and local technology consultancy capabilities. The evaluation should identify successes and&#13;
failures of the Program and recommend improvements which could be made to similar initiatives&#13;
in future. The evaluation studies will be funded by the ITD Project. It is expected that the Pi oject&#13;
would achieve the following performance targets by the mid-term and final evaluations:&#13;

Changes to the Manual&#13;
6.18  This manual will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if desired by the Bank and Executing&#13;
Agency, and may be modified as required in order to achieve the objectives of the Program,&#13;
subject to the prior approval of both parties.&#13;
6.19  The purpose of the Manual is to provide clear guidelines on how DAPATI should be&#13;
implemented. It seeks to balance three main concerns:&#13;
the need to achieve Program objectives&#13;
simplicity, transparency and efficiency in operating the Program&#13;
a desire to minimize possibilities for misinterpretation of the Program or misuse of grant&#13;
moneys and related assistance.&#13;
Accounting and auditing procedures&#13;
6.20  The Executing Agency will enter into a contract with the Management Contractor which gives it&#13;
the authority to facilitate processing of payment from govemment on behalf of the services&#13;
providers. Management Contractor will clear service providers invoice with the DIP Project&#13;
Manager, who will provide authorization of approval for payment to the KPKN. Upon approval&#13;
of documentation, KPKN will issue a payment authorization to Bank Indonesia to wire transfer&#13;
funds from the Project Special Account to the service provider's bank.&#13;
6.21   Annual general statements for DAPATI will be prepared and then audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Auditors reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the&#13;
end date of the period to which they relate.&#13;
General conditions&#13;
6.22  Grants shall be made on terms whereby DAPATI Management Contractor shall obtain, by written&#13;
contract with the firm and the consultant, rights adequate to protect the interests of the Bank and&#13;
the Government of Indonesia, including:&#13;

diligence and efficiency and in accordance with sound technical, financial and managerial&#13;
standards and to maintain adequate records&#13;
(b)    a requirement that the services to be financed by grant shall (i) be purchased at a&#13;
reasonable price, account being taken of their complexity and quality and the experience of&#13;
the parties rendering them, and (ii) be used exclusively to carry out the agreed qualifying&#13;

relating to the foregoing and to the administration, operations and financial condition of&#13;
the firm and to the benefits to be derived from the qualifying activity&#13;
(d)   to suspend or terminate the rights of the firm to obtain grant aid for a project upon failure&#13;
of the said firm to perform its obligations under its contract with the Management&#13;
Contractor. Similarly, to remove the consultant from the register of approved senrice&#13;
providers should the consultant faii meet the terms and conditions of the contract.&#13;

ANNEX 12&#13;
Pa2e 1 of 6&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
Industrial Technology Development Proiect&#13;
Commercialization of Public Technology Support Institutions&#13;
1.  In order to help private industry in Indonesia improve its international&#13;
competitiveness, Government is committed to improving the delivery of public&#13;
technology support services to industrial firms, i.e., research and development,&#13;
improvement of productivity, efficiency, and innovation, and testing and quality&#13;
upgrading services. This would be done by moving Indonesia's Public Technology&#13;
Support Institutions (PTSIs) closer to meeting the needs of private industry,&#13;
particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Ultimately, the Government intends&#13;
to develop them into independent legal entities, but still in the frame work of their&#13;
mission as agent of technology development.&#13;
2.   To realize these objectives, the Government intends to implement the&#13;
following actions:&#13;
- give the PTSIs necessary incentives to become more demand driven and&#13;
commercially oriented and establish targets for them to become increasingly&#13;
self-financing;&#13;
- reduce Government controls to encourage the institutions to become more&#13;
agile in responding to the technological needs of industrial firms, while also&#13;
increasing the institutions' accountability for results;&#13;
- implement internal management reforms at the institutions to ensure that they&#13;
become more professionally managed and results oriented;&#13;
- encourage private provision of technology support services and competition&#13;
between, and among, public and private technology services providers; and&#13;
- encourage provision of technology support services and incentives to private&#13;
industries.&#13;
3.   A number of initiatives have been taken in recent years to  improve the&#13;
incentives for PTSIs, even though further initiatives are necessary for PTSIs to&#13;
become more commercial. BPPT has recently implemented a new income- sharing&#13;
scheme that allows its working units and laboratories to share earning from industry.&#13;
The charter of LIPI noW also provide for similar income-sharing schemes and&#13;
permits its working units and laboratories to accumulate industrial earnings from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;

one year to the next to build cash reserves for improvement of their facilities and&#13;
equipment. The MOI institutes have been permitted since 1990 to apply revenues&#13;
from industrial sources to cover some of the operating costs of the institutes.&#13;
4.   This letter further elaborates on the measures which the Government intends&#13;
to undertake to implement the above actions.&#13;
5.   Increased self-financin2. One of the key measures for commercializing the&#13;
PTSIs will be to promote and increase their funding from industrial sources and&#13;
gradually phase out their financial support from the Government budget. In this&#13;
regard, income generation targets have been established for all PTSIs at BPPT,&#13;
LIPI, and MOI.&#13;
6.   At BPPT the share of earning from non-governmental sources through the&#13;
sale of technology and technology services in total BPPT expenditure is targeted to&#13;
increase from less than 5 percent today to 25 percent by the year 2000. LIPI's&#13;
self-financing ratio is expected to rise from 15 percent today to 75 percent by the&#13;
year 2000. Likew,se for the MOI R&amp;D Institutes such self-financing targets have&#13;
been established. For example, the R&amp;D Institute for the Chemicals Industry&#13;
(BBIK) and the Semarang Industrial Institute (BISm) are expected to increase their&#13;
self- financing ratios from 18 percent and 48 percent, respectively in 1994, to 48&#13;
percent and 75 percent respectively by the year 2000 (see attachment).&#13;
7.   Improvement Incentives and Flexibility in Earning Usaze. It is recognized&#13;
that incentives for management and staff of PTSIs need to be improved to provide&#13;
greater stimulus for commercialization of their operations. The main measures to be&#13;
pursued would be to permit the institutes to&#13;
a. retain earnings from industrial contracts&#13;
b. use those earning flexibly, including for incentives for researchers and staff of&#13;
PTSIs, for covering expenses to develop business and deliver services to&#13;
industry, and for building cash reserves to improve the facilities and equipment of&#13;
the institutes.&#13;
c. accumulate balance from one fiscal year to the next for securing sustainability&#13;
of technology support services to industry.&#13;
8.   Reformin! Internal Management. In addition, it is necessary to implement&#13;
improvements in the internal management of PTSIs.&#13;
- First, the MOI institutes will establish advisory boards--including&#13;
representation from the private sector and user industry associations--which will&#13;
meet periodically to review the work of the PTSIs, and advise them on the ways&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;

and means to strengthen the links between the institutes and private industry. At&#13;
MOI institutes, further organizational restructuring will be undertaken to bring&#13;
their research groups and development groups together.&#13;
-  Second, all MOI institutes are required to prepare business plans that should&#13;
be targeted to meet the needs of industry. Those plans would become the main&#13;
instruments for monitoring the operations of the institutes against annual&#13;
performance targets. The plans would identify the major market for the institutes'&#13;
technology  services,  the competitive advantage of the institutes, their&#13;
expectations on penetration of those markets, and their related investment&#13;
requirements in hardware and human resource development. The plans would&#13;
need to clearly support the orientation of institutes toward activities which would&#13;
realize increasing self-financing of their activities. In addition, this model&#13;
approach is expected to be implemented by other PTSIs regarding their missions.&#13;
- Third, BPPT, LIPI, and two of MOI's institutes. BBIK and the BISm--will&#13;
implement modern business development and technology management practices&#13;
and related management information system to:&#13;
a.   establish key functions that are critical to generating revenue through&#13;
commercial research and technology licensing, including technology&#13;
marketing, business development, and contract and intellectual property&#13;
management;&#13;
b    strengthen internal management system to support contract research,&#13;
including modern budgeting, costing, and technology pricing systems, project&#13;
management, and human resources management systems, and&#13;
c.   provide management and staff training to facilitate the transition to&#13;
industry-oriented technology service organizations.&#13;
- Fourth, to help BPPT, LIPI and the MOI institutes design and implement&#13;
these improvements in their internal management system, the Government will&#13;
seek technical assistance through collaboration with foreign organization which&#13;
have a demonstrated capability to manage successful contract research&#13;
organizations. The local institutes will engage in long-term partnership (twinning&#13;
arrangements) with  such qualified foreign organizations. To synergize the&#13;
strengths of various Indonesian PTSIs, twinning among PTSIs belonging to&#13;
different agencies also will be undertaken. As a pilot, P3KT (LIPI) and BBIK&#13;
(MOI) will seek greater cooperation to provide more effective technology&#13;
services to the Indonesian chemical industry.&#13;

9.  Encouraging Comnetitive Provision of Technolo2y Support Services. The&#13;
government will strongly encourage competitive provision of technology support&#13;
services between public and private technology service providers. Already there is&#13;
substantial competition in the provision Qf services to industry for improving&#13;
product quality, reliability and delivery, and for improving product designs and&#13;
productivity, and the Government will seek to further facilitate entry of new&#13;
qualified private service providers. This will be further encouraged through the&#13;
matching grant scheme of the proposed Technology Services Matching Grant&#13;
Scheme. As part of the arrangements for implementing the DAPATI, the training&#13;
would be available to registered consultants for improving their planning,&#13;
management and delivery of consulting services. Also, the Government will seek to&#13;
provide for a more equitable competition environment among private and public&#13;
technology service providers by adjusting the fees of PTSIs charged to their clients&#13;
to reflect the true cost of services and to avoid cross-subsidies between PTSIs and&#13;
public enterprises.&#13;
10. To provide support for the implementation of the above action plan for&#13;
commercializing the operations of the PTSIs, the Government seeks support from&#13;
the World Bank in the preparation and implementation of an Industrial Technology&#13;
Development Project (ITDP). On the basis of the above actions and the support&#13;
provided under the project, the Government of Indonesia aims to considerably&#13;
strengthen the contribution of the PTSIs and private providers of technology&#13;
support services toward improved competitiveness of industry.&#13;
11. In addition, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, State Minister for&#13;
Technological Research, and other related Government Agencies will provide&#13;
necessary legal aspects for the implementation of this action plan.&#13;

            The objective of the Industrial
            Technology Development Project is to enhance the
            competitiveness of Indonesian industry, particularly of
            small and medium industries (SMIs), by: 1) providing public
            and private technology support services; 2) facilitating the
            access to public and private technology service providers;
            3) strengthening public technology support institutions; and
            4) improving the formulation and coordination of industrial
            technology policies. The project has four components: 1)
            improvement of metrology, standards, testing and quality
            (MSTQ) support services; 2) diffusion of good technology
            practices through a cost-sharing matching grant fund to
            finance the competitive provision of technology upgrading
            services to SMIs by both public and private technology
            suppliers; 3) improvement of the productivity of public
            research and development (R&amp;D); and 4) improvement of
            industrial and technology policy formulation.
