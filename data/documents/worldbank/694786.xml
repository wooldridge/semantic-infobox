1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.1   China has become the third largest producer of energy in the world.  The&#13;
country's primary commercial energy supply and consumption increased at around 4.1&#13;
percent per year from 1980 to 1995 to reach 1,239.0 tons of standard coal equivalent&#13;
(tce). Coal is the most important source of energy, accounting for about 74.8 percent, and&#13;
oil for 17.2 percent of the total production. Hydroelectric power (6.1 percent), natural gas&#13;
(1.9 percent), and small quantities of shale oil and geothermal power make up the&#13;
balance. During the same period, the primary energy consumption increased at about 5.1&#13;
percent to reach 1,290.0 tce. The largest consumer of energy is the industrial sector (75.4&#13;
percent), followed by households (9.7 percent), services (8.6 percent), and agriculture&#13;
(6.3 percent). Details of the primary energy outputs are given in Annex 1. 1, and total&#13;
energy production and consumption in Annex 1.2.&#13;
Energy Resources&#13;
1.2   Coal. China has large coal deposits, with recoverable reserves of about 900&#13;
billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. In 1995, the country produced more than&#13;
1.2 billion tons of raw coal. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4 to 1.6 billion&#13;
tons of coal a year. The best quality coals are found in North China, where Shanxi and&#13;
Inner Mongolia each has reserves of about 200 billion tons. However, insufficient&#13;
transport capacity makes it extremely difficult to move sufficient coal to the large&#13;
consumption centers in Central and East China.&#13;
1.3   Hydroelectric Potential. China is rich in water resources and has a long tradition&#13;
of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's hydroelectric potential is&#13;
estimated at 1,900 TWh a year, but only about 9 percent of it has been developed. Most&#13;
of the potential is located in the Southwest (70 percent), about 1,500 km away from the&#13;
main demand centers. However, the long gestation period for hydroelectric projects and&#13;
the lack of capital have slowed the development and utilization of hydroelectric&#13;
resources.&#13;
1.4   Crude Oil. China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil are estimated at&#13;
some 80 billion tons, of which approximately 20 percent are proven. The 1995&#13;
production amounted to about 150 million tons of crude oil and cumulative production&#13;
reached about 2.45 billion tons. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the&#13;
world. However, with the sharply increasing consumption, the country will become net&#13;
importer in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.5   Natural Gas. China's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 trillion m3, of&#13;
which 3 to 5 percent are proven. In 1995, China produced 17.7 billion m3 of natural gas.&#13;
About 58 percent of the current production is nonassociated gas, mostly from Sichuan&#13;
Province. The remaining gas production is associated with onshore crude oil production.&#13;
1.6   Biomass. Noncommercial biomass energy use currently amounts to about one&#13;
quarter of total energy consumption in China. Fuelwood and agricultural residues are the&#13;
chief biomass fuels, and they are consumed almost entirely by rural households. China is&#13;
promoting a variety of measures to achieve environmentally sustainable biomass supply&#13;
and consumption levels, including more efficient use of biomass, tree planting, and&#13;
substitution of other fuels for traditional biomass fuels.&#13;
1.7   Nuclear Energy. Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to sustain&#13;
15,000 MW of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. China commissioned its first&#13;
commercial nuclear power plant (300 MW) in 1992, in Zhejiang Province. In 1993/94,&#13;
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) was also commissioned; 70 percent of its&#13;
output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The construction of a few additional plants is&#13;
planned to start before the year 2000, primarily in regions which lack coal and&#13;
hydroelectric resources.&#13;
1.8   Other Energy Resources. Other energy resources play a small role in energy&#13;
supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been found in&#13;
locations throughout the country. Although wind and solar energy have promising&#13;
prospects, they are not expected to significantly affect the overall supply of energy in the&#13;
near future. Oil shale deposits are large, but little is exploited because of lack of viable&#13;
technology.&#13;
B. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.9   China is the second largest producer of electricity in the world. By the end of&#13;
1995, China's total installed capacity reached about 217.2 GW, 75 percent of which is&#13;
thermal capacity and the rest hydropower (24 percent) and nuclear power (1 percent).&#13;
(See Annex 1.3.) China has 5 regional and 8 separate provincial power networks, of&#13;
which 7 have installed capacities of 10 GW or more. The five regional power grids (East&#13;
China, North China, Northeast China, Central China and Northwest China) coordinate the&#13;
systems of several provinces and municipalities together. The total length of the high and&#13;
medium voltage transmission lines (i.e., from 500 kV down to 110 kV) lines amounted to&#13;
267,500 km and the transformer capacity of substations down to the 110 kV at the&#13;
secondary level (owned and operated by the power utilities) was about 234 GVA.&#13;
Considering the power supply as a whole from production to end-user supply,&#13;
transmission and distribution losses are estimated at about 16 percent of generation.&#13;
1.10 Total power generation in China increased by more than two and one-half times&#13;
between 1980 and 1995, an average increase of 8.0 percent per year over 14 years. About&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1,007 TWh were generated in 1995, with thermal power accounting for 80 percent. The&#13;
share of hydroelectric power has remained fairly stable over the last decade. Even though&#13;
the Government has maintained a strong commitment to hydropower development,&#13;
capital constraints and the distance of major resources from load centers inhibit more&#13;
rapid development. Coal-fired power plants provide more than 90 percent of thermal&#13;
generation, with oil-fired generation accounting for most of the balance. The share of oil-&#13;
fired generation has declined sharply since the early 1980s, owing to a concerted&#13;
government policy to minimize petroleum use for power. The share of natural-gas based&#13;
generation is negligible and is expected to remain so unless major natural gas discoveries&#13;
are made.&#13;
1.11  Industry continues to dominate electricity consumption in China, accounting for&#13;
74.9 percent of electricity use in 1995; agriculture accounted for 6.2 percent, residential&#13;
consumers for 10.2 percent, municipal and commercial consumers for 6.9 percent, and&#13;
transport and communications for 1.8 (Annex 1.4). Industrial demand has continued to&#13;
drive overall power demand; more than 71.5 percent of incremental electricity use&#13;
between 1985 and 1995 was in the industrial sector. Although service is of uneven&#13;
quality, rural access to electricity is high; about 96 percent of the nation's villages and&#13;
about 80 percent of rural families now have access to electricity.&#13;
1.12  Despite the strong growth in electricity output, most areas of China continue to&#13;
suffer from severe power shortages. Since GDP grew by 9.3 percent per year during&#13;
1980-95, the elasticity of electricity consumption growth relative to GDP growth was&#13;
only 0.86-an exceptionally low elasticity for any country over a sustained period, and&#13;
particularly for an industrializing country such as China. Chinese officials estimate the&#13;
shortfall between peak power demand and supply at more than 10 percent. Daily load&#13;
curves are relatively flat, as industries have had to respond to power shortages during the&#13;
peak daytime periods through rescheduling of work shifts. It is expected that power&#13;
shortages will be more acute in the two to three coming years because of accumulated&#13;
delays in power projects due to financial constraints.&#13;
1.13  China's GDP is expected to grow by at least 8 to 9 percent per year during the&#13;
ninth five-year plan (1996-2000). This rapid economic growth will put tremendous&#13;
pressure on China's electric power industry to avoid yet worse shortages. China's&#13;
electric power construction program for the 1990s will certainly be the world's largest.&#13;
Assuming that an aggressive conservation effort can enable an electricity demand/GDP&#13;
growth elasticity of 1.0 to be sustained, electricity demand could be expected to continue&#13;
to grow at average rates of 8 to 9 percent per year during 1996-2000. To keep pace with&#13;
this demand growth, China would need to add some 17-20 GW of capacity per year. The&#13;
total investment in China in 1995 was Y 1,945 billion, of which Y 101 billion (5.2&#13;
percent) was in the power sector.&#13;
1.14 Although China's current power development program emphasizes addition of&#13;
300 to 600 MW units, over one half of China's thermal power capacity is still in units&#13;
below 200 MW. Only about 12 percent of the total installed capacity is in units of 300&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
MW or more, compared to 60 to 80 percent in industrialized countries. The average&#13;
gross conversion efficiency of thermal units over 6 MW has improved over the 1980s,&#13;
reaching about 33 percent in 1995. This efficiency level is not unreasonable given the&#13;
low average unit sizes in operation, but is substantially lower than the 36 to 37 percent&#13;
typical of reasonably efficient systems with larger units.&#13;
Power Sector Institutions&#13;
1.15 In the period from 1988 to 1992, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) maintained&#13;
primary responsibility within the Central Government for policy, planning and regulation&#13;
of the power and related energy subsectors. In May 1993, MOE was restructured during&#13;
a broad government reorganization, and a Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) was&#13;
established, along with a Ministry of Coal and the existing China National Petroleum&#13;
Corporation. Chart 1 shows the entities that are within MOEP oversight. The State&#13;
Planning Commission (SPC), on behalf of the State Council, has the responsibility for&#13;
review and approval of the strategic plans, investment programs and general pricing&#13;
policy of the energy sector. The Ministry of Water Resources still supervises rural&#13;
electrification and development of decentralized power systems in approximately 800&#13;
counties relying mostly on small hydropower.&#13;
1.16  Until early 1993, the State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) channeled&#13;
Government funds to finance coal and power projects. SEIC was responsible for&#13;
onlending funds for projects of national importance and representing the central&#13;
Government in jointly financed projects. However, in April 1994, SEIC (and five other&#13;
specialized investment companies under SPC were merged into a new policy bank, the&#13;
State Development Bank (SDB). The Construction Bank of China usually performs&#13;
policy lending as a disbursement/collection agency for SDB, and commercial banking&#13;
activities on its own account. For provincial power companies, equity and loans/debt&#13;
representing central government's contribution are channeled through the regional&#13;
groups. In some cases, such as Ertan Hydropower Electric Company Ltd. equity stakes&#13;
are held by the State Development Investment Corporation (SDIC).&#13;
C. POWER SECTOR REFORMS-PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS&#13;
1.17  Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s involved a series of&#13;
incremental adjustments, largely to mobilize additional investment capital to finance&#13;
rapid growth. Taken as a whole, these adjustments have resulted in a sector structure that&#13;
is largely unrecognizable from that in the early 1980s. In 1980, the power sector was&#13;
fully controlled, managed and funded by Central Government departments. By the early&#13;
1990s, the sector had become much more decentralized, less vertically integrated and&#13;
open to nonutility producers.&#13;
1.18  In conformance with broad national reforms toward a market economy begun in&#13;
mid-1992, the Government initiated, in the early 1990s, a program of power sector&#13;
reforms.  The reform agenda includes:  (a) overhaul of the regulatory and legal&#13;
framework for the sector; (b) further diversification in financing for power development,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
including private sector participation; (c) institutional restructuring-commercialization&#13;
and corporatization of power companies, and associated sector restructuring; and (d) the&#13;
rationalization of power tariffs.   The Chinese approach to reform  encourages&#13;
experimentation with different reform options and institutional forms. This gradual&#13;
approach permits the Chinese to examine the relevance and applicability of specific&#13;
reforms, and also fine-tune implementation for their broader dissemination or replication&#13;
in other parts of the country.&#13;
1.19 Legal and Regulatory Reform. China recently undertook two important steps in&#13;
its legal and regulatory reform agenda. First, the Standing Committee of the 17th session&#13;
of the National People's Congress passed the first "Electricity Law of the People's&#13;
Republic of China," which became effective on April 1, 1996. Second, the State Council&#13;
(a) approved the creation of the National Power Grid Company which will operate the&#13;
future national (inter-regional) transmission network; and (b) proposed for consideration&#13;
by the National People's Congress a restructuring plan that provides for abolition of&#13;
MOEP and transfer of regulatory and policy functions to the State Economic and Trade&#13;
Commission (SETC), the State Planning Commission (SPC), and the China Electricity&#13;
Council. A State Power Corporation of China has been created and entrusted with the&#13;
ownership functions of the central government and development of the inter-regional&#13;
transmission systems.&#13;
1.20 An important and innovative experiment in regulatory reform is being conducted&#13;
in Hainan Province to make the transition to an unbundled sector structure with separate&#13;
regulation. Actions undertaken include: creation of a single transmission and distribution&#13;
shareholding company; several generating companies, including a wholly foreign owned&#13;
one; and establishment on June 1, 1995 of a separate agency to regulate the sector.&#13;
Lessons learned from this experiment will be taken into account in furthering the power&#13;
sector reform efforts in other provinces. A more ambitious experiment is under&#13;
consideration for Fujian Province.&#13;
1.21  Diversification of Financing. Following changes in power project financing&#13;
from Government grants to loans in the early 1980s, the Government encouraged the&#13;
development of additional financing sources from provincial and local governments,&#13;
large consumers, and, in some cases, private foreign partners. Since the mid-1980s, the&#13;
Government has allowed power produced from power plants financed through these&#13;
nontraditional sources to be sold at prices which provide for full debt servicing and&#13;
reasonable profit. This is referred to as the "new plant, new price policy." Empowered&#13;
with rights to impose surcharges to accumulate funds for investment in power&#13;
construction, provincial and local governments have become a key source of financing,&#13;
providing more than half of the investment funding for the sector in 1995. As a&#13;
consequence, the share of Central Government financing in power sector investment has&#13;
fallen sharply, from 91 percent (mostly through State Budget allocations) in 1980 to less&#13;
than 35 percent in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.22 Newly formed corporations have also become important players. The Huaneng&#13;
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was formed in 1985 with the aim&#13;
of attracting foreign capital and technology for power plants located mainly in coastal&#13;
areas. As an independent power producer, HIPDC operates its 11 plants (6,700 MW&#13;
total) under a build, own, and operate (BOO) framework. HIPDC had a mandate to raise&#13;
funds from the international financial market. It has been able to tap bilateral and&#13;
suppliers' credits, and commercial bank loans, and raise foreign equity capital through an&#13;
American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue in New York in 1994. The Sunburst Energy&#13;
Development Corporation (SEDC), with three large power projects under&#13;
implementation, and the recently established China Power Investment Corporation&#13;
(CPIC) are other windows for the Government's investment, and cofinancing with the&#13;
local governments and foreign sources in power projects. Several joint ventures have&#13;
been established to build several power plants with capacity ranging from 40 MW to 700&#13;
MW. Two major joint-venture projects have been recently approved in Shandong&#13;
Province (Rizhao power plant-2x350 MW coal-fired units) and in Shanghai (Zhadian&#13;
power plant-4x100 MW gas turbines). The main characteristics of the Zhadian Joint&#13;
Venture are provided in Box 1. 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Box 1.1: THE ZHADIAN JOINT VENTURE IN SHANGHAI&#13;
The Zhabei Gas turbine plant is an innovative joint venture project with General Electric (GE) of the USA.&#13;
The project entity is a joint venture company with Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC)&#13;
and GE having equity shares of 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The joint venture built a fuel-oil&#13;
fired gas turbine facility with 4x100 MW units. The gas turbines were supplied by GE through a&#13;
competitive bidding process. The procurement of equipment was done independently from the financial&#13;
participation of GE in the joint venture.&#13;
The total project cost is Y 1.8 billion ($216 million). The equity contribution by the two partners is about&#13;
Y 612 million, or 34 percent of the total cost. The debt financing comprises of a syndicated commercial&#13;
loan of $124 million arranged by Standard Chartered Bank and loans from domestic Chinese Banks. The&#13;
Construction Bank of China has provided bridge financing during the construction and commissioning&#13;
period. The interest rate for the syndicated commercial loan is 1.92 percent per year over 6-month LIBOR&#13;
and the loan is repayable in 10 years.&#13;
The most interesting elements of this project are:&#13;
I. The absence of government guarantees and back stops of any form to obtain the commercial debt and&#13;
equity financing. A letter of support was provided by the Shanghai Municipal Government.&#13;
2. A limited recourse debt financing secured by the strength of both the project fundamentals and&#13;
SMEPC's balance sheet.&#13;
3. The target rate of return on GE's equity investment is 15 percent. The joint venture has a cooperation&#13;
period of 15 years from the date of commercial operation. GE will transfer its ownership share to&#13;
SMEPC at the end of the cooperation period without compensation.&#13;
4. A construction and commissioning period of 13 months from site preparation. This short period&#13;
minimized the construction risk, as well as the interest cost during construction, and made the financing&#13;
simpler.&#13;
5. SMEPC has to meet 63 conditions set by the commercial lenders before the first disbursement to be&#13;
made. SMEPC met all 63 conditions and the loan was fully disbursed.&#13;
1.23   Build, own and transfer (BOT) schemes have also been introduced in China, most&#13;
notably the privately-financed Shajiao B and Shajiao C thermal power plants in&#13;
Guangdong Province, respectively commissioned in 1986 and 1996. Another major BOT&#13;
project sponsored by two international consortia has been approved by SPC in 1993 in&#13;
Fujian Province (Meizhouwan power plant- 2x350 MW coal-fired units). The process of&#13;
international competitive tendering for projects has also begun'. SPC approved the&#13;
Shanghai authorities initially considered the idea of developing the Waigaoqiao Phase 11 project as a BOT&#13;
operation and received a Technical Assistance grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to examine the&#13;
option. The study supported by ADB and undertaken by an international consulting firm concluded that BOT&#13;
projects of this complexity and scale are difficult to finance on a limited recourse basis without changes to the&#13;
existing regulatory framework in China and government's guarantees. Considering that the proposed changes&#13;
require further analysis and time, the Government authorized SMEPC to undertake the project to avoid&#13;
exacerbation of the acute power shortages in Shanghai and impending the momentous growth of the Pundong area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Laibin B project in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to be the first power project&#13;
to test the new international competitive bidding framework. SPC invited 12 of the 31&#13;
companies/consortia that sought prequalification to bid competitively for the Laibin B&#13;
project. Six international consortia participated in the competition. Bids were opened in&#13;
May 1996 and an 18-year concession was awarded to the winning consortium on&#13;
November 11, 1996. The major characteristics of this pilot project are provided in Box 2.&#13;
Bids will be shortly issued for Changsha project (2x350 MW coal-fired units) in Hunan&#13;
province.&#13;
Box 1.2: THE FIRST COMPETITIVELY BID BOT IN CHINA-THE LAIBIN B COAL-&#13;
FIRED POWER PROJECT&#13;
The Laibin B power project consisting of 2x350 MW coal-fired units is located in Guangxi Zhuang&#13;
Autonomous Region. It is the first BOT power project in China in which the developer was selected through&#13;
international competitive bidding. The project's 18-year (including 3-year construction period) concession&#13;
was awarded on a conditional basis to a consortium of EDF and GEC-Alsthom of France on November 11,&#13;
1996. The consortium has been given six months to reach financial closure. The total project cost is&#13;
estimated to be around $650 million.&#13;
The main interesting characteristics of the project are:&#13;
1. The project developer was selected through a competitive bidding process based on the lowest levelized&#13;
tariff level offered.&#13;
2. The project developer assumes the sole responsibility for reaching financial closure within six months of&#13;
Concession Agreement initiation.&#13;
3. No government (including state-owned financial institutions) guarantees and back stops of any form are,&#13;
or will be, provided to the equity investors and/or debt financiers. There are, however, letters of support&#13;
and comfort provided by SPC, State Administration for Exchange Control (SAEC) and MOEP.&#13;
4. Though the electricity fee payment is divided into capacity payment and energy payment, the tariff is&#13;
designed on a take-or-pay basis with a minimum take-off based on 5,000 hours of operation annually.&#13;
For any generation above the minimum take-off that the purchaser is willing to buy, the same tariff level&#13;
would apply.&#13;
5. No local investors or financiers are permitted to participate in the debt and equity financing of the&#13;
project, and the project cost would be fully financed by foreign exchange.&#13;
D. POWER PRICING&#13;
1.24   Electricity price reform  in China has involved a series of incremental changes&#13;
over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980s, multiple-track pricing was introduced for both&#13;
producers and consumers, in line with the shift away from full vertical integration in the&#13;
industry. This strategy was successful in increasing overall tariff levels but, by the end of&#13;
the decade, the power pricing system had become too complex and difficult to manage.&#13;
Recent reforms, therefore, have focused on simplification and rationalization of the&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1.25  At the producer level, the state catalog prices charged for power produced by&#13;
Central Government-financed plants were modified in 1993. Prices for the electricity&#13;
produced from all new power plants are now set by contract to cover financing and&#13;
operating costs (guidance prices), on a plant-by-plant basis, and rolled into the average&#13;
power tariff. Cost recovery through the tariff system for new investments is thus ensured.&#13;
Prices also are similarly determined for existing plants financed through loans. The&#13;
electricity tariff applied for plants built with grant financing before 1985 has been&#13;
rationalized to now include an improved mechanism to automatically adjust prices&#13;
annually to reflect fuel and transportation cost variations. Following the enactment of the&#13;
Electricity Law, the dialogue between the Chinese government and the Bank focused on&#13;
implementation of the new pricing principles to ensure that producer prices reflect the&#13;
level and structure of the cost supply (introduction of a capacity and energy payment&#13;
formula), and are conducive to economic dispatch and optimum production efficiency.&#13;
However, these principles are not reflected in the temporary regulations issued lately by&#13;
MOEP.&#13;
1.26  At the consumer level, the prices are in general an average of the state catalog&#13;
prices and the guidance prices (that reflect full costs of supply from sources not financed&#13;
through the Central Government) plus national and local fees and surcharges. While the&#13;
situation varies between regions, the nature of the existing pricing system is such that&#13;
average consumer prices (including fees and surcharges) used to approximate long-run&#13;
marginal cost levels in areas with rapid load growth, such as the coastal provinces.&#13;
However, the average prices in some of these provinces increased at a lower pace than the&#13;
long run marginal cost due to limitation of price increases to control inflation in 1995 and&#13;
1996. The average consumer prices in these areas still covers more than 85 percent of the&#13;
long run marginal cost. Prices in underdeveloped areas, such as Sichuan and Henan, are&#13;
still below long-run marginal cost levels, but are being gradually rationalized with&#13;
increasing supply from new plants.&#13;
1.27  While consumer tariffs are approaching satisfactory levels, their structure remains&#13;
too complex, lacks transparency, and is inequitable. In most areas, including some North&#13;
China systems, unfair "old" administered rates (based on catalog prices) and "new" rates&#13;
(including higher prices for new power) continue to be applied to different consumers&#13;
through a complex quota system. Some consumers are protected from high cost&#13;
electricity supply charges and certain local surcharges because they still hold "in-plan"&#13;
quota allocations, but other new or small consumers must pay high prices well above&#13;
actual supply costs. In Shanghai, the two-track pricing system was abolished in 1989.&#13;
Following the enactment of the Electricity Law, further and speedier progress is expected&#13;
on abolishing the two-track pricing system (unification of tariffs has been reaffirmed by&#13;
article 37 of the Electricity Law) and improving the tariff structure to reflect the costs of&#13;
supply of final consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION&#13;
Electricity Conservation&#13;
1.28  China has over 10 years of experience in the active promotion of electricity&#13;
conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its program lies in the&#13;
well developed institutional framework. Electricity conservation is handled by the&#13;
network of "Three Electricity Offices," with offices at central, provincial, prefectural and&#13;
county levels throughout the country. These offices are under the leadership of local&#13;
Economic Commissions, and coordinate their work with provincial power companies.&#13;
They monitor electricity intensity and use patterns in all major enterprises, promote&#13;
adoption of conservation technologies and electricity management improvements, and&#13;
assist in organizing funding for efficiency programs supported by the Government.&#13;
1.29  These measures have been successful, as is indicated by the low ratio of elasticity&#13;
of growth in electricity demand to GDP growth of 0.86 achieved during 1980-95.&#13;
However, energy electricity conservation programs have always been based on centrally&#13;
designed energy/electricity conservation policies and heavily-subsidized administrative&#13;
programs. Faced with constrained fiscal revenues, the government is now promoting a&#13;
shift in the energy conservation programs to rely more on market-based incentives and&#13;
introduce innovative and commercially-based contractual and financing mechanisms.&#13;
Environmental Protection&#13;
1.30  Thermal power production currently accounts for about one third of China's coal&#13;
consumption, and this share is expected to increase gradually. Improvements in the&#13;
efficiency of coal use in this sector not only alleviate pressure on the coal production and&#13;
transportation system, but also have a major impact on particulate, sulfur and carbon&#13;
dioxide emissions.&#13;
1.31  The achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through&#13;
expanded development of large generating units, is a priority because of the recent rapid&#13;
growth of small coal-fired power plants in unit sizes of 50 MW or less. While national&#13;
policy emphasizes the addition of 300 MW and 600 MW units, new projects have lagged&#13;
behind demand and local governments are continuing to invest in large numbers of new&#13;
small plants, largely due to difficulties in mobilizing the necessary investment resources.&#13;
Compared with a state-of-the-art plant, these plants consume over 60 percent more coal&#13;
per unit of electricity produced. This results in at least 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide&#13;
emissions (depending upon the coal used), and roughly 60 percent greater emissions of&#13;
carbon dioxide. Particulate emissions from the small plants are proportionally even&#13;
higher due to use of inefficient particulate control technology. If a sufficient number of&#13;
large-scale projects cannot be brought on stream in a timely fashion to substitute smaller&#13;
inefficient units, there is little doubt that this problem will worsen.&#13;
1.32  In terms of emission control in large and medium-scale plants, China has made&#13;
substantial progress in particulate control, through deployment of high efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
electrostatic precipitators. As the country has large reserves of low sulfur coal, China is&#13;
just beginning to employ sulfur dioxide control devices in areas where ambient air quality&#13;
standards require them. Top priority should be given to areas which are densely&#13;
populated and/or must rely on local high sulfur coal, such as in Shanghai and southwest&#13;
China. In these regions, thermal power plants often burn coal of over 4 percent sulfur&#13;
content (e.g., 5 to 10 times the level typical through most of north and east China), and&#13;
development of sulfur dioxide control strategies and corresponding investments are now&#13;
urgent in these areas. Several pilot flue gas desulfurization (FGD) projects have been&#13;
implemented in areas where the sulfur content of coal is relatively high: Luohang in&#13;
Sichuan Province, Japanese-assisted projects in Shandong Province and Taiyuan in&#13;
Shanxi Province.&#13;
1.33  Recently, the Chinese Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution&#13;
related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to&#13;
the problem. The government also announced its intention to keep particulate emissions&#13;
at about 3.8 million tons (1992 level). In June 1994, it also announced that it will spend&#13;
about $2 billion over the next seven years on an environmental program aimed at keeping&#13;
So2 emissions at a level of 15 million metric tons a year as part of a comprehensive&#13;
program of acid rain abatement. An SO2 emission tax (from Y 0.15 to 0.2 /kg of SO2) iS&#13;
being experimented in several provinces and municipalities and a tax (YO.04/kg of SO2)&#13;
is applied to emissions exceeding the 1982 standards in all provinces.  Several&#13;
municipalities, such as Shanghai, issued very stringent environmental regulations and&#13;
increased efforts to enforce existing regulations by imposing fines on industrial units and&#13;
power plants that do not comply with emission standards and/or imposing use of flue gas&#13;
desulfurization for all new plants.  However, achievement of the Government's&#13;
environmental objectives still requires a more adequate enforcement of the national&#13;
regulations.&#13;
F. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK&#13;
World Bank Power Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.34  In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in China&#13;
places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two&#13;
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on&#13;
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's&#13;
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector&#13;
work on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing domestic and foreign&#13;
private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector&#13;
work). The study (Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector&#13;
report (China Power Sector Reform: Towards Competition and Improved Performance,&#13;
Report 12929-CHA, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese&#13;
institutions. Technical assistance is also now being provided to help the central&#13;
authorities develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The&#13;
energy conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Environment Facility (GEF), lending support to selected industrial, environment and&#13;
energy projects, and development of a series of new Bank/GEF investment operations.&#13;
The power sector lending program now focuses on assistance for: (a) the detailed aspects&#13;
of implementation of the power sector reforms; (b) balanced development of generation&#13;
and transmission to reduce the power shortages and transmission bottlenecks that&#13;
continue to hamper development and slow the market orientation of the sector;&#13;
(c) increased efficiency at the supply and end-use levels; and (d) enhanced environmental&#13;
protection.&#13;
Bank Involvement&#13;
1.35  The proposed project supports the joint agenda of the Chinese Government and&#13;
the Bank to improve the efficiency and minimize the environmental impacts of electricity&#13;
delivery and use, while, concurrently, alleviating existing power shortages and satisfying&#13;
the surging demand. These objectives will be achieved through: (a) installation of the&#13;
first two very large supercritical coal-fired units to take advantage of higher fuel&#13;
efficiency and economies of scale; (b) introduction of the "bubble concept"2 in China to&#13;
control sulfur dioxide emissions in the Shanghai area; and (c) introduction of market-&#13;
based policies and competition and further opening of the sector to domestic and foreign&#13;
private investors. Specifically, the Waigaoqiao project offers a unique opportunity to&#13;
support the Bank's agenda by establishing a demonstration case in the areas of reform,&#13;
new technologies and investment strategies for environmental control, and innovative&#13;
financing in the Chinese power sector.&#13;
1.36  The sulfur dioxide emissions control strategy to be developed in Shanghai under&#13;
the proposed project will be the first of its kind in China. While low sulfur coals are&#13;
being used for most power generation in East China to control sulfur dioxide emissions,&#13;
the density of coal consumption causes excessive ambient sulfur dioxide concentrations&#13;
in the region. In recognizing this problem, Shanghai Municipality has taken a lead role&#13;
by enacting new local regulations to control overall sulfur dioxide emissions. However,&#13;
China is still at an early stage of utilizing more cost effective regulatory instruments than&#13;
command and control measures. The proposed project will assist Shanghai Municipality&#13;
in developing an overall air quality improvement program by prioritizing power plants&#13;
with application of the most suitable and cost effective desulfurization technologies. The&#13;
approach focuses on minimizing health impacts by controlling pollution at those priority&#13;
power stations that are chiefly responsible for poor air quality. It allows simultaneously&#13;
for both increased generation of thermal power in the region and improved air quality at&#13;
minimum cost. The strategy to be adopted by Shanghai will be used as a model for other&#13;
municipalities and provinces to replicate.&#13;
2 Trading of sulfur dioxide emissions among industries and power plants operating in the same area to&#13;
achieve no net increase of sulfur dioxide emissions at the lowest cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.37 The restructuring plans of SMEPC will significantly support commercialization of&#13;
the sector. The plan calls for: (a) unbundling and structural separation of generation&#13;
from transmission and distribution; (b) establishment of efficient wholesale generation&#13;
tariffs with a framework of contracts; and (c) public listing of the restructured SMEPC&#13;
generation company. The unbundling of transmission from generation represents the first&#13;
such initiative undertaken in China. This would lead to the creation of SMEPC as a&#13;
purchasing agent with a transparent framework for promoting generation investment by&#13;
independent producers. The proposed contractual and commercial relationships for&#13;
power sales and purchases represent a significant step toward introducing competition at&#13;
the generation level. The public listing of the generation company will also facilitate&#13;
easier commercial financing for system expansion.&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.38  Since the first project for the power sector in 1982, the Bank has helped to finance&#13;
19 large power generation and load management projects: nine thermal, eight hydro, and&#13;
two transmission projects (Annex 1.5). Technical assistance in project management,&#13;
system operations, finance, management, and institutional reform has been included in&#13;
the projects. Through these operations, the Bank has helped to introduce: (a) state-of-art&#13;
technologies and control systems in generation, transmission, distribution and pollution&#13;
control; (b) modem operational practices and procedures to improve power system&#13;
reliability and control; (c) improved methods for project planning, design, construction&#13;
management, and environmental impact assessment; (d) improved financial planning and&#13;
utility management tools and practices; (e) techniques for computing and establishing&#13;
appropriate tariff structures and levels; and (f) assistance in sector and regulatory reform.&#13;
1.39  The past operations in China, especially the nine thernal power projects including&#13;
the Wujing Thermal Power Project (Loan 2852-CHA) in Shanghai, yielded useful lessons&#13;
on project preparation, technical and operating aspects of power systems and sequencing&#13;
of institutional reform.  The experience gained from  these projects and broader&#13;
international experience in power sector restructuring have also been taken into account&#13;
in developing a power sector strategy to be pursued by the Bank in China, and designing&#13;
focused and implementable institutional changes.&#13;
1.40  Lessons learned from the previous thermal power projects were considered during&#13;
the preparation of the proposed project in order to: (a) improve the project management&#13;
and ensure proper coordination between the different contractors; (b) improve the quality&#13;
of the environmental and resettlement studies, environmental and resettlement&#13;
management plans and monitoring measures; and (c) ensure commitment of the&#13;
beneficiary to the institutional and corporate reforms to be included in the project.&#13;
Actions have been taken to involve international consultants in assisting the beneficiary&#13;
to: (a) assess the environmental impacts of the project and designing the proper measures&#13;
to address them; (b) list the new generating company in local and/or international stock&#13;
markets, and (c) clarify the relationship and define the required arrangement between the&#13;
transmission and distribution company and the generators. Finally, a serious boiler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
accident at the Beilungang power station in Zhejiang province will be taken into account&#13;
in boiler design and specifications, coal specifications, and adequate measures of coal&#13;
quality monitoring.&#13;
1.41  In power sector restructuring and reform implementation, international experience&#13;
shows that even in advanced countries with strong and transparent institutional systems&#13;
and well established market economies, the time needed to build consensus on the reform&#13;
directions, establish a new regulatory framework, and implement structural changes can&#13;
be very long. China faces the same problems witnessed in Central and Eastern Europe.&#13;
Hopes for achieving quick progress in economic regulation and restructuring of the power&#13;
sectors in these countries have been unfulfilled because of the intricate links of&#13;
institutional changes to politics, complex macroeconomic reforms to ensure the transition&#13;
toward market economy without disruption, and the difficult implementation of adequate&#13;
and credible legal and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, the proposed project focuses on&#13;
limited implementable priority actions to improve the commercial orientation of the&#13;
beneficiaries, improve the contractual arrangements, increase competition, and improve&#13;
operational efficiency of the sector.&#13;

2. THE POWER MARKET IN SHANGHAI&#13;
A. AN OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1   The Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project is located in the Pudong area (south bank&#13;
of Yangtze River in Shanghai), one of the fastest growing areas in China and, probably,&#13;
in the world. Shanghai is China's largest industrial, commercial and financial center. It&#13;
has been experiencing rapid economic growth since 1990. From 1990 to 1995, the&#13;
average annual growth rate of GDP was 13.0 percent. During the same period, electricity&#13;
demand increased at an average rate of 10.8 percent per year. In 1995, the city's peak&#13;
electricity demand was 6,916 MW and total electricity supply was 39,130 GWh,&#13;
corresponding to a load factor of 64.6 percent. For the same year, generation from&#13;
SMEPC owned power plants was 11,614 GWh, and purchase by SMEPC from other&#13;
generators within Shanghai Municipal Power Grid (SMPG) was 24,516 GWh, of which&#13;
independent power producers (Huaneng Group and others) was 15,903 GWh, and&#13;
captive-generation of industries (including Baoshan Steel Mill Power Plant) was 8,613&#13;
GWh. The balance (3,000 GWh) was primarily imported from the East China Power&#13;
Grid (ECPG). The economic development in Shanghai has been constrained by&#13;
persistent power shortages due to insufficient installation of new generation. Currently,&#13;
power shortage is estimated at 400-500 MW, including planned load curtailment. Load is&#13;
shed on a daily basis, in particular, during summer months due to increasing air&#13;
conditioning load.&#13;
2.2   SMPG is part of the ECPG. ECPG covers Shanghai Municipality, Jiangsu,&#13;
Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces. SMPG is connected with neighboring provinces within&#13;
ECPG through two 500 kV AC lines: Huangdu (Shanghai)-Doushan (Jiangsu) and&#13;
Nanqiao-Pingyao (Zhejiang). There is a 500 kV DC line from Gezhouba (central&#13;
China) hydropower station to Nanqiao. The imported power increased from 500 MW in&#13;
1990 to 1,000 MW in 1995: 300 MW from Gezhouba hydropower station and the rest&#13;
from ECPG (see Table 2.1). The potential for increased purchase is limited because all&#13;
neighboring provinces within ECPG are experiencing severe power shortages and high&#13;
demand growth and the available capacity of Gezhouba hydropower is fully committed.&#13;
The quota for import (from ECPG and Gezhouba) was set by ECPG at 500 MW for the&#13;
period 1996-1998, 700 MW for 1999, and 1,100 MW for the period 2000-2004.&#13;

B. LOAD FORECAST&#13;
2.3   Electricity consumption in Shanghai is dominated by the industrial sector. More&#13;
than 80 percent of electricity is consumed by industry. The service sector, the most&#13;
rapidly growing sector, is the second largest consumer followed by the residential sector.&#13;
From 1990 to 1995, the average annual growth rate of consumption was 7.5 percent, 16.9&#13;
percent and 15.9 percent for industry, service and residential, respectively. For the same&#13;
period, the average annual growth rate of total consumption was 8.9 percent and the load&#13;
factor decreased from 70.9 percent to 64.6 percent. The high load growth is expected to&#13;
continue to alleviate existing shortages and the quota system imposed on the industrial&#13;
sector, and meet the soaring demand of the tertiary and residential sectors.&#13;
2.4   The load forecast for SMPG during the period 1996-2010 was prepared by&#13;
SMEPC for the ninth five year plan. The energy consumption forecast is based on a&#13;
combination of econometric and analytical methods. The econometric methods are based&#13;
on the assumption that electricity conservation efforts would continue to sustain the low&#13;
0.8-0.9 elasticity of electricity consumption to GNP (15 to 20 percent higher than the&#13;
very low elasticity experienced in the early 1990s). The analytical methods are based on:&#13;
(a) market surveys and development plans of the major electricity consumers to&#13;
determine their future production plans and sector output growth, and (b) electricity&#13;
consumption per unit of output of large industries and electricity intensities of the&#13;
considered sectors to determine future electricity consumption taking into account load&#13;
management and electricity conservation measures (see Box 3). Future electricity supply&#13;
is derived taking into account the power sector self consumption and system losses.&#13;
Finally, load forecast is based on expected load factor and structural change in the system&#13;
load curve. The results of load forecast carTied by SMEPC are summarized in Table 2.2.&#13;
TABLE 2.2: LOAD FORECASTS FOR SHANGHAI POWER GRID&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.5    During 1996-2005, the peak demand would increase by about 10,000 MW  in&#13;
Shanghai. The proposed load forecast is used as the base case scenario in the least cost&#13;
study. However, to ensure the robustness of the project, a low case scenario, based on a 6&#13;
percent growth during 1996-2005 compared to 9.5 percent in the base case, was&#13;
considered in the sensitivity analysis.&#13;
Box 2.1: ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION IN SMPG&#13;
1. Electricity conservation has been actively pursued by SMEPC under the leadership of "Three&#13;
Electricity Office"3. In 1995, the total electricity saving in Shanghai amounted to 350 GWh, of which&#13;
64 GWh was attributed to the reduced electricity consumption per unit of output of major industries&#13;
(targets for reduction of electricity consumption per unit of output of about 120 industrial products are&#13;
set annually and monitored closely) and 210 GWh was attributed to the improved efficiency of&#13;
electrical appliances, industrial processes, and insulation technologies. For the same year, generation&#13;
using waste heat reached 590 GWh.&#13;
2. The following electricity conservation programs are included in the ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000):&#13;
- Replacement of inefficient motors with total capacity of about 1,000 MW (series J, JO and JO2 )&#13;
with new and 2 to 4 percent more efficient motors for electricity savings of 50-100 GWh per year.&#13;
- Renovation of heat processing (by introduction of new insulation material) with total capacity of&#13;
200 MW and an annual energy savings of 120 GWh.&#13;
- Introduction of new central air conditioning processes to produce ice during off-peak hours and&#13;
release cold air during peak hours, resulting in peak reduction of 50 MW.&#13;
- Initiation of a Green Light campaign to promote efficient lighting and electronic converters. A total&#13;
of 1,200,000 electricity saving lamps will be introduced within 5 years to achieve annual electricity&#13;
saving of about 85 GWh.&#13;
- A pilot program to install energy management systems in 30 large hotels has been successful and its&#13;
results will be disseminated through seminars.&#13;
3. In recent years, SMEPC has relied more on economic incentives to ensure that consumers:&#13;
(a) minimize their consumption during peak hours; and (b) replace the old and inefficient appliances&#13;
by more efficient ones. The retail tariff has been unified since 1989 and the average price increased to&#13;
the LRMC level. Time-of-day tariff has been offered to all large consumers (monthly consumption of&#13;
100 MWh or more). SMEPC has been monitoring the effectiveness of the current time-of-day tariff&#13;
and is prepared to modify its structure and level, if necessary.&#13;
3  "Three Electricity Office" is responsible for electricity allocation, electricity conservation, electricity&#13;
consumption and safety. It is chaired by the Municipal Economic Committee. SMEPC is the executive&#13;
agency of the Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. THE ROLE OF THE PROJECT&#13;
2.6   The proposed project addresses the development of the Shanghai power system in&#13;
an integrated approach based on: (a) increase of electricity supply to reduce the acute&#13;
shortages in Shanghai through installation of two very large supercritical coal-fired&#13;
thermal units; and (b) a more cost effective environmental protection approach through&#13;
installation of FGD equipment at an existing power plant to at least offset the anticipated&#13;
sulfur dioxide emissions in Shanghai from the proposed project (bubble concept).&#13;
2.7   The project was selected following consideration of different alternatives, mainly&#13;
unit sizes between 600 MW and 900/1,000 MW, construction of plants close to the load&#13;
center Shanghai, construction of plants in the neighboring provinces within ECPG or&#13;
construction of mine mouth plants in Shanxi Province and transmission of electricity to&#13;
Shanghai. The scheme with 2 x 900/1,000 MW coal-fired supercritical units at the site&#13;
next to Waigaoqiao Phase I was found to be the most economically attractive option to&#13;
ease the energy shortage in Shanghai.&#13;
2.8   The proposed project supports Shanghai's pollution control program, the first of&#13;
its kind in China, and includes installation of FGD equipment at the existing 2 x 300 MW&#13;
coal-fired units of Shidongkou Power Plant which is located in the immediate suburbs of&#13;
Shanghai city. The coal consumed by this plant is from Shanxi province with a sulfur&#13;
content of about 1.8 percent. The installation of FGD equipment will reduce the SO2&#13;
emission by 90 percent and therefore reduce the SO2 concentration in the urban area of&#13;
Shanghai. This was based on the considerations that: (a) Pudong area is not currently&#13;
polluted with respect to sulfur dioxide; and (b) use of very low sulfur coal for&#13;
Waigaoqiao Phase II will allow the plant to operate without an FGD and still maintain&#13;
good air quality in the area.&#13;
2.9   The proposed project also includes a component to construct 500 kV transmission&#13;
lines with associated substations and to reinforce the 220 kV systems to connect the plant&#13;
to the Shanghai system. Construction of 50 km double circuit 500 kV lines linking the&#13;
proposed Waigaoqiao Phase II power plant to the existing Yanggao and Yanghang&#13;
substation will allow Shanghai grid to form a 500 kV double circuit ring and, therefore,&#13;
greatly increase the supply reliability. The 220 kV ring can then be reconfigured to&#13;
reduce the fault level at the voltage level and improve power distribution in the Shanghai&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;

3. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
3.1   The beneficiary of the proposed loan is the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power&#13;
Company (SMEPC). The proposed loan would be the second IBRD loan to SMEPC&#13;
following the successful implementation of the Wujing Thermal Power Project&#13;
(Ln. 2852-CHA).&#13;
A. LEGAL STATUS AND ORGANIZATION OF SMEPC&#13;
3.2   SMEPC is the principal power sector entity in Shanghai under the Ministry of&#13;
Electric Power. SMEPC, established in 1986, is an independent legal entity with a&#13;
corporate status under its charter formulated in accordance with the Laws on Industrial&#13;
Enterprises and the Regulations of Structural Reform of East China Power Network.&#13;
SMEPC will be restructured beginning in 1997 to conform with the new Chinese&#13;
Company Law (November 1994) and the Electricity Law (December 1995). SMEPC is&#13;
an affiliate of the East China Electric Power Group Company (ECEPGC), which is&#13;
responsible for coordination of development and operation of the East China Power&#13;
System comprising power companies in Shanghai Municipality, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and&#13;
Anhui Provinces. The functions of SMEPC have been outlined in its charter. The charter&#13;
dated September 9, 1989 empowers SMEPC to build and operate power plants in&#13;
Shanghai Municipality. SMEPC has the authority to receive the proceeds of the proposed&#13;
World Bank loan through the Central Government to carry out the construction and the&#13;
management of the Waigaoqiao (Phase II) power plant, and to enter into a Project&#13;
Agreement with the World Bank.&#13;
3.3   SMEPC is headed by a general manager appointed by MOEP. Three deputy&#13;
general managers are separately responsible for: (a) capital construction; (b) production&#13;
and power supply; and (c) business and personnel management. In addition, the general&#13;
manager is assisted by one chief engineer, one deputy chief economist, and one deputy&#13;
chief accountant. The organization chart of SMEPC is detailed in Chart 2.&#13;
3.4   SMEPC has the following subsidiaries that have no independent legal status:&#13;
7 power plants; 3 power supply companies; I maintenance services company; and&#13;
8 noncore units for design, manufacturing, fuel supply, repair, training, and a hospital.&#13;
B. STAFFING AND TRAINING&#13;
3.5   The total staffing of SMEPC as of December 31, 1995, was 31,998 persons of&#13;
whom 15.25 percent are engineers and technicians, 14.41 percent are administrative staff,&#13;
and 70.29 percent are skilled and unskilled workers. Details of SMEPC staffing are&#13;
shown in Annex 3.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.6   The core group of key managers and technical personnel are appointed by MOEP.&#13;
Most staff are recruited locally. Staff are hired under contracts based on their skill and&#13;
training. SMEPC has a electric power vocational school (secondary school level) and a&#13;
training center for the on-the-job staff. The training center runs a number of technical&#13;
and management courses for staff.&#13;
3.7   The buildings and basic infrastructure at the training center and the electric power&#13;
vocational school are essentially sufficient to meet long-term requirement of the&#13;
Company. However, there is a need to develop new course materials, provide training to&#13;
the teaching staff, and modernize the teaching facilities.  The training component&#13;
included in the proposed project is designed to meet these requirements.&#13;
C. PLANNING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.8   Power bureaus and companies are responsible for developing annual and five-year&#13;
production and investment plans which are integrated into the national plans and are&#13;
approved, through MOEP's auspices, by SPC. In the past, financial planning was&#13;
confined to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOEP, to the power production&#13;
being planned. Although a power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes, it&#13;
ordinarily would not be revised to reflect differences between estimated prices and actual&#13;
prices. However, with the economic changes in the 1980s, prices have begun to move&#13;
toward market levels and the Government now finances investments through loans rather&#13;
than grants. Centralized control is being relaxed and replaced by greater financial&#13;
autonomy and responsibilities for the power entities.&#13;
3.9   SMEPC follows the new accounting standards established by MOF (July 1,&#13;
1993).  These accounting standards are, in general, comparable with international&#13;
practices. Few specialized accounting entries are utilized in a few instances to manage&#13;
power exchanges and transactions specific to the power industry.&#13;
3.10  MOEP recognizes the importance of financial management in the power sector in&#13;
China and is promoting relevant training programs for all the power institutions under its&#13;
control. Many of the power bureaus/companies, including SMEPC, have been equipped&#13;
with personal computers and software for planning, budgeting, and accounting functions.&#13;
Information from the bureaus/companies can be transferred to MOEP and consolidated&#13;
into regional and national data.&#13;
3.11  These systems represent a good first generation of automated management&#13;
information; however, they still are not sufficient and integrated as a network to promptly&#13;
provide financial and related statistical information about a power entity's operations to&#13;
the various management levels, timely supplying each level with the necessary and&#13;
adequate information. SMEPC needs to introduce accounting and financial management&#13;
systems that will: (a) enable managers to be held accountable for costs of activities and&#13;
functions over which they have control; (b) provide information for comparative analysis&#13;
of actual costs with budgets for decision making; and (c) provide transparency of&#13;
information for investors, government, lenders, and the public in general. The proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
project includes a technical assistance component to support SMEPC in establishing&#13;
appropriate systems and procedures to upgrade their budgeting and financial accounting&#13;
systems, including provision of software and hardware, as well as enhancement of their&#13;
staff skills. The terms of reference for the proposed studies under this project are&#13;
presented in Annex 3.2. Assurances were obtained from SMEPC during negotiations&#13;
that it will: (a) carry out the accounting and financial management systems studies&#13;
according to the schedule agreed with the Bank; and (b) implement the recommended&#13;
organizational improvements, and accounting andfinancial management systems, taking&#13;
into account Bank comments.&#13;
D. AUDIT&#13;
3.12  Under the proposed project, SMEPC's accounts will be audited by the Foreign&#13;
Investment Audit Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA). This arrangement is&#13;
satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from SMEPC that it will: (a) maintain and&#13;
provide to the Bank semiannual progress reports with unaudited accounts to reflect&#13;
project expenditures for the period under report compared with the original project cost&#13;
estimates; (b) furnish the Bank with the audited accounts for the project, statements of&#13;
expenditures, and financial statements of SMEPC within six months of the end of each&#13;
fiscal year; (c) implement any changes to its accounting practices as recommended by the&#13;
financial management consultants to meet international accounting standards; and (d)&#13;
require its auditors to comply with international auditing practices and provide audit&#13;
plans prior to each audit. For the first audit report, the auditors are expected to provide:&#13;
(a) a summary of the effects of accounting changes arising from the adoption of new&#13;
MOF regulations and corrections of any deviations from MOF regulations as interpreted&#13;
with reference to international accounting standards and practices; and (b) a management&#13;
letter summarizing any significant matters that may have arisen during the conduct of&#13;
audit.&#13;
E. TARIFF&#13;
3.13  Reform in Shanghai Municipality, as in other parts of China, went a long way to&#13;
correcting the deficiencies of the pricing system that developed after the introduction of&#13;
the multitier pricing system in 1986: (a) the capacity charge of industrial tariffs were&#13;
increased even though not sufficiently to cover a significant part of fixed costs;&#13;
(b) simpler provisions were introduced to take into account annual escalation of coal&#13;
prices; and, more importantly, (c) unified consumer tariffs at different voltage levels were&#13;
introduced in 1989. Shanghai was the first city in China to abandon the quota-based&#13;
pricing system  and adopt unified consumer tariffs.  SMEPC has also introduced&#13;
incentives to efficiently use the installed capacity by introducing time-of-the-day tariffs&#13;
for large consumers. Furthermore, it developed a gradual and comprehensive plan to&#13;
rationalize the pricing system in the Municipality.&#13;
3.14 In 1995, the electricity sales of SMEPC amounted to 28.2 TWh at an average tax-&#13;
inclusive final tariff of Y 0.452/kWh. The average tariff includes three tiers: (a) the state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
catalogue tariff of Y 0.296/kWh accounting for 65.5 percent of the average tariff; (b) a&#13;
second tier determined by the local government to cover the extra cost of power from new&#13;
power plants of Y 0.109/kWh amounting to 24.1 percent; and, finally, (c) the surcharges&#13;
and taxes of Y 0.047/kWh amounting to 10.4 percent of the total.&#13;
F. RESTRUCTURING PLAN OF SMEPC&#13;
3.15  SMEPC is currently embarking on a restructuring program within the new&#13;
market-oriented regulatory framework. The plan is described in detail in Annex 3.3. The&#13;
main elements of the restructuring program are:&#13;
(a)   Unbundling  and  structural  separation  of  generation  from&#13;
transmission and distribution. SMEPC will be structured as a limited&#13;
liability company for transmission and distribution, with the complete&#13;
separation of all generation from transmission and distribution. The&#13;
objective of this unbundling is to create a purchasing agency structure&#13;
which will encourage investment in generation, and allow SMEPC to&#13;
focus on the efficient operation of the monopoly transmission and&#13;
distribution network. The complete structural separation of generation&#13;
from transmission would create a framework for competitive procurement&#13;
of future generation and efficient production. This unbundling will be&#13;
completed by December 1997. All noncore business of SMEPC will be&#13;
transformed into profit/cost centers or subsidiary companies by December&#13;
1997.&#13;
(b)   Efficient wholesale generation tariffs. A revised system of wholesale&#13;
electricity tariffs would be devised for power purchase from each&#13;
generating plant on the system. These tariffs would encourage efficient&#13;
dispatch and overall economic efficiency. All power will be purchased by&#13;
the restructured SMEPC transmission and distribution company on the&#13;
basis of wholesale contractual arrangements. All generators on the system&#13;
will be treated equally and dispatched on a nondiscriminatory basis. The&#13;
principles and methodology for the determination of wholesale generation&#13;
tariffs will be submitted to the government for approval in October 1997.&#13;
The revised framework of tariffs and the contracts for power purchase will&#13;
be implemented within 12 months of approval by the government.&#13;
(c)   Private Financing of Generation. The generation assets of SMEPC will&#13;
be restructured to form a viable generation company for subsequent listing&#13;
on domestic and/or international stock exchanges. The listing of the&#13;
generation company will be completed by December 1998. SMEPC was&#13;
selected by the State Council in January 1997 as one of thirty eight&#13;
enterprises eligible for public listing on foreign stock exchanges. Public&#13;
listing of the generation company will facilitate increased private equity&#13;
and debt financing for future system expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.16  Specialized advisory services for implementing the planned structure and&#13;
developing the requisite contractual arrangements for power purchases by the SMEPC&#13;
transmission and distribution business will be provided under the proposed project. The&#13;
tasks to be carried out by the advisory team are detailed in the terms of reference in&#13;
Annex 3.4. Assurances were obtainedfrom SMEPC that it will: (a) employ consultants&#13;
to assist in the implementation of the SMEPC Restructuring Plan; and (b) afford the&#13;
Bank an opportunity to exchange views periodically and at least annually on the progress&#13;
in the Restructuring Plan.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The proposed project is intended to:&#13;
(a)   increase electricity supply to reduce the acute power shortages in Shanghai&#13;
through development of two very large coal-fired supercritical thermal&#13;
units;&#13;
(b)   develop a program to apply for the first time in China the "bubble&#13;
concept" for cost effective air quality management within Shanghai&#13;
Municipality;&#13;
(c)   support the ongoing power sector reform by restructuring SMEPC in line&#13;
with the power sector reform strategy; increasing private sector&#13;
involvement through listing of the generation company; and adjusting the&#13;
tariff level to accommodate the stricter sulfur dioxide emission standards;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   promote an innovative and diversified financing model for large&#13;
infrastructure projects and improve the access of power entities to&#13;
international financial markets.&#13;
4.2   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the above objectives. The key&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
4.3   Progress in achieving these objectives would be tracked and monitored through&#13;
specific measurable targets.  Project implementation in terms of construction and&#13;
commissioning would be monitored as actual physical output or percentage of project&#13;
completion (power generated, sulfur dioxide emissions reduced, etc.), achievement of&#13;
efficiency and quality of power supply (availability and load shedding frequency),&#13;
improvement of management, and advances in power sector reform (financial targets and&#13;
state shares reduced).&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4   The proposed project will include investment, environmental protection, power&#13;
sector reform and institutional development components as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of China's first two 900-1,000 MW coal-fired supercritical&#13;
thermal units in Pudong as the second phase of the Waigaoqiao power&#13;

performance monitoring systems to minimize coal consumption and&#13;
gradually introduce advanced maintenance techniques;&#13;
(b)   installation of FGD facilities at Shidongkou Power Plant to at least offset&#13;
the anticipated sulfur dioxide emissions from the proposed project; and&#13;
improve air quality in critically polluted areas of Shanghai Municipality;&#13;
(c)   construction of two 500 kV transmission lines (2 circuits x 50 km) with&#13;
associated substations to connect the units to SMPG;&#13;
(d)   construction management and engineering services to assist SMEPC in&#13;
site construction supervision, technical interfacing coordination,&#13;
construction schedule and quality assurance control;&#13;
(e)   technical assistance to SMEPC for implementation of modem accounting&#13;
and financial management systems to improve financial reporting,&#13;
budgeting, and monitoring for more efficient management of the&#13;
enterprise;&#13;
(f)   technical assistance to SMEPC for implementation of the restructuring&#13;
plan including: (i) review and detailed development of the planned sector&#13;
structure, e.g., separation of generation from transmission and distribution;&#13;
(ii) development of commercial arrangement for market operation; and&#13;
(iii) financial and corporate restructuring of the generation company,&#13;
including public listing of the company on one or more overseas stock&#13;
exchanges (paras 3.15-16 and Annexes 3.3-34); and&#13;
(g)   a management development and training program, supported by technical&#13;
assistance, consulting services, upgrading and equipping SMEPC's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
training facilities, to enhance SMEPC's managerial, legal, technical and&#13;
financial capabilities given the perspective of a broader sector reforn.&#13;
4.5   Waigaoqiao Phase II. This component consists of two 900-1,000 MW coal-fired&#13;
supercritical thermal units designed and constructed on the basis of internationally&#13;
well-proven technology. Each unit comprises a supercritical boiler with low NOx&#13;
burners and a 900 MW tandem-compound or 1,000 MW cross compound type&#13;
supercritical turbine-generators. The proposed project is an extension to the existing&#13;
Phase I plant (4x300 MW-three units in commercial operation and one still under&#13;
construction). The site is located in Gaodong town of the Pudong New Area (the south&#13;
bank of the Yangtze River), 18 km from the center of Shanghai city.&#13;
4.6   The Phase II power plant under the proposed project will consume up to about 4.8&#13;
million tons of coal annually. The coal, produced at the Shenfu-Dongsheng mines&#13;
(located in the border area of Shaanxi province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous&#13;
Region), will be transported by rail to Huanghua port or Qinhuangdao and Tianjing ports&#13;
and shipped to the coal jetty near the plant site. The substantial distances involved to&#13;
transport coal from mines to the power station suggested considering coal washing prior&#13;
to transport. Such an analysis (performed for Phase I) indicated that since ash-mined coal&#13;
had such a low ash content, there was no significant economic advantage to coal washing.&#13;
The units will be designed to burn the design coal with a calorific value of 22,489-&#13;
24,041 kj/kg, ash content of 12.0-16.8 percent and sulfur content of 0.43-0.64 percent.&#13;
Letters of intent for coal supply and coal transportation were issued by relevant&#13;
authorities in October 1996. Security of coal supply and transportation is considered&#13;
satisfactory. Particulate emissions will be controlled by electrostatic precipitators (ESPs)&#13;
with a removal efficiency of 99.42 percent. The plant will also include an on-line&#13;
performance monitoring system to maximize efficiency and reduce coal consumption and&#13;
provide useful data for preventive maintenance (see Annex 4.2).&#13;
4.7   To transmit electricity generated by the proposed project to the existing Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Power Grid (SMPG), two 500 kV double circuit lines with a total length of&#13;
50 km, of which 1 km will be crossing the Huangpu River, will be constructed under the&#13;
proposed project. In addition, one new substation at Sanlin with two 1,000 MVA,&#13;
500/220 kV transformers and an extension at Sijing substation with one 750 MVA,&#13;
500/220 kV transformer will be supported by the proposed project (see Annex 4.2).&#13;
4.8   Environmental Protection. A FGD system will be installed at Shidongkou&#13;
Power Plant Units 1 and 2 to remove approximately 48,000 to 49,000 tons of sulfur&#13;
dioxide emissions per year, which is more than the anticipated sulfur dioxide emissions&#13;
from the proposed project (estimated at 44,000 to 45,000 tons/year). The selected FGD&#13;
system represents state-of-the-art, commercially proven technology, and will be designed&#13;
for 90 percent removal of sulfur dioxide (paras. 4.12-4.22 and Annex 4.2). A high quality&#13;
grade gypsum byproduct will be produced by the FGD units for sale to the local&#13;
construction industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4.9   Management Development and Training.  To meet SMEPC's long-term&#13;
staffing requirements and to further develop SMEPC's management capability, a&#13;
comprehensive technical assistance and training program is included under the proposed&#13;
project. It consists of: (a) technical assistance to implement modem accounting and&#13;
financial management systems (see para. 3.11 and Annex 3.2); (b) technical assistance to&#13;
implement restructuring plan (para. 3.16 and 4.4-f and Annex 3.4); (c) training in utility&#13;
management; (d) project-related training for technical staff; and (e) upgrading and&#13;
equipping SMEPC's training facilities. It is planned that 553 staff in various fields will&#13;
receive 808 total staff-month training in China and abroad (see Annex 4.3). Assurances&#13;
were obtained from SMEPC that it will carry out the management development and&#13;
training program as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.10  Project Design and Consulting Services.  The feasibility study report for&#13;
Waigaoqiao power plant Phase II was prepared by East China Electric Power Design&#13;
Institute (ECEPDI) in December 1993 and was updated in May 1996. A report&#13;
summarizing the studies carried out by Chinese entities on the selection of unit size was&#13;
prepared jointly by an international engineering consulting firm and ECEPDI in April&#13;
1996. Based on the feasibility study, SMEPC and ECEPDI completed a concept design&#13;
report in August 1996 for MOEP's review. The project was approved by the State&#13;
Council on April 25, 1997.&#13;
4.11  Following the Bank's Guidelines, international engineering consultants were&#13;
selected in July 1996 to assist in finalizing design, preparing bidding documents and&#13;
evaluating bids for the major procurement packages, and designing interface&#13;
coordination. Funding in the amount of $4 million out of the China Reform, Institutional&#13;
Support and Preinvestment Project [CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA)] has been provided for&#13;
the above engineering service ($2.7 million) and other preparation work of the proposed&#13;
project. To ensure efficient and timely implementation of the project construction,&#13;
international consultants will be employed to assist in construction management under the&#13;
proposed project. The scope of services is defined in Annex 4.4. The overall project&#13;
concept and design is satisfactory.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.12  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been&#13;
assigned Category A. The Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared by ECEPDI&#13;
and SMEPC with the assistance of an international consultant specializing in&#13;
environmental issues related to thermal power plants. The EA has been approved by the&#13;
National Environmental Protection Agency and has been accepted by the World Bank. It&#13;
is considered that all environmental aspects of the project are satisfactorily addressed&#13;
with respect to current Chinese and World Bank environmental regulations, policies and&#13;
procedures. The project has been designed and will be implemented in accordance with&#13;
modern concepts of environmental management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.13 The Shanghai Municipal Government has given SMEPC formal approval to&#13;
introduce a "bubble concept" into the project design4, whereby sulfur dioxide emissions&#13;
released from the Waigaoqiao thermal power plant project component would be more&#13;
than compensated for by sulfur dioxide emission reductions achieved with the FGD&#13;
component to be retrofitted at the existing Shidongkou Power Plant. The net result will&#13;
be an overall increase of 1,800 or 2,000 MW in thermal power generation capacity and an&#13;
overall decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions of 3,000-5,000 tons per year for the Shanghai&#13;
Municipality. All other environmental aspects of the project should cause minimum&#13;
disturbance to the human and natural environment. An environmental management&#13;
program consisting of both mitigation and monitoring action plans (see Annex 4.5) will&#13;
be incorporated into the project to maintain and confirm satisfactory environmental&#13;
performance on a sustainable basis.&#13;
4.14 The Waigaoqiao power plant component is a greenfield operation, located at the&#13;
Shanghai Municipal Pudong New Area on the southern bank of the Yangtze River. It is&#13;
about 18 km from the center of Shanghai city. The component is the second phase of a&#13;
three phase plan to introduce approximately 5,000 MW of thermal power generation&#13;
capacity at the Pudong site. Currently, the 1,200 MW first phase (4 units x 300MW) is&#13;
nearing completion with three units on-line and the remaining unit scheduled for&#13;
commissioning this year. The Shidongkou Power Plant (FGD component) is located&#13;
further upstream of Waigaoqiao power plant on the Yangtze River (approximately 20 km&#13;
to the center of Shanghai city). However, air quality modeling analysis confirrned that&#13;
local wind patterns are such that reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions at Shidongkou&#13;
would yield greater improvements to air quality in Shanghai Municipality than&#13;
comparable reductions at Waigaoqiao.&#13;
4.15  Limited land availability in Shanghai Municipality confined selection of the&#13;
Waigaoqiao power plant component to the Pudong site. Existing infrastructure at this site&#13;
(primarily associated with the Waigaoqiao Phase I power plant) and proximity to the&#13;
Yangtze River for coal delivery, cooling water supply, and ash transport, reinforced the&#13;
Pudong site as most reasonable. About 50 km of 500 kV double circuit transmission&#13;
lines will be constructed to connect to the grid at Yanggao and Yanghang substations,&#13;
respectively. They do not pose particular environmental problems as the transmission&#13;
line routing will either follow a greenbelt being established along a highway currently&#13;
under construction or along the same right-of-way as an existing 220 kV line.&#13;
4.16  Selection of Shidongkou as the appropriate thermal power plant for an FGD&#13;
retrofit was made on the basis of a careful study conducted by SMEPC. A summary of&#13;
the study is presented in Annex 4.6. The study included all seven power stations owned&#13;
by SMEPC and included the following considerations in the selection process: (a) annual&#13;
4 Shanghai Municipality environmental regulations normally require a flue gas desulfurization (FGD)&#13;
unit be incorporated into the design of any new power station. In this case that would have been&#13;
Waigaoqiao.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29 -&#13;
emissions of sulfur dioxide; (b) plant age; (c)space availability for an FGD retrofit; (d) air&#13;
quality improvements to critically impacted areas; and (f) ease of disposal/use for spent&#13;
sorbent. On the basis of these factors, Shidongkou emerged as the most suitable choice.&#13;
An international FGD consultant reviewed and confirmed SMEPC's analysis and their&#13;
choice of a wet limestone scrubbing system with forced oxidation to produce market&#13;
grade gypsum. The FGD technology selected represents a modern, state-of-the-art,&#13;
commercially proven system with a substantial history of reliable commercial operation&#13;
worldwide.&#13;
4.17  The Waigaoqiao project area is flat, adjacent to the Phase I power plant and the&#13;
Yangtze River.  Neighboring land use is primarily commercial/light industrial,&#13;
interspersed with residential communities. The location is well removed from the&#13;
Shanghai central city, offering excellent possibilities for the dispersion of liquid effluents&#13;
and flue gas emissions to avoid sensitive receptor areas. The plant will occupy about 144&#13;
hectares. It is SMEPC's intention to sell both bottom ash and fly ash. Bottom ash will&#13;
initially be disposed on-site at a specially constructed ash yard embankment adjacent to&#13;
the Yangtze River to create a space for the coal storage yard. Ultimately, bottom ash and&#13;
fly ash that is not sold will be transported to a barren, sparsely inhabited disposal site also&#13;
on the bank of the Yangtze River about 14 km downstream of the power plant. The ash&#13;
disposal site has been selected and constructed to insure minimum environmental impacts&#13;
to any adjacent surface and groundwaters.&#13;
4.18  The Shidongkou Power Plant is also situated on the outskirts of Shanghai central&#13;
city in a community primarily occupied by farms and industry. Both suburban residential&#13;
development, and further industrial development appear to be in progress. The FGD&#13;
plant to be retrofitted at Shidongkou will be designed to produce a marketable gypsum&#13;
product for the local booming construction industry. Should portions of that market fail&#13;
to materialize, an existing disposal site is currently available for immediate use. In&#13;
addition, sufficient land is available on-site to develop a larger disposal area for ultimate&#13;
use.&#13;
4.19 At Waigaoqiao, modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into&#13;
the design of the power plant, such as high efficiency electrostatic precipitators (ESPs),&#13;
and low NOx burners. In addition, fuel to be supplied to the power plant will be from the&#13;
Shengfu-Dongshen mine in the border area of Shaanxi Province and Inner Mongolia&#13;
Autonomous Region. This coal is considered to be of the best quality available in China,&#13;
containing 12.0 to 16.77 percent ash and 0.43 to 0.64 percent sulfur. There is limited&#13;
space available to install additional pollution control systems (e.g., FGD or additional&#13;
ESP capacity, but not both) if required as a result of either changes in future Chinese&#13;
standards and/or environmental conditions in Shanghai. Annex 4.5 provides a summary&#13;
of key environmental issues associated with this project component, anticipated potential&#13;
impacts, the mitigation plan to assure these potential impacts are minimized, and the&#13;
monitoring program with which actual impacts will be measured, compared with EA&#13;
predictions and if necessary, indicate further mitigating actions to be taken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Strengthening of SMEPC with respect to environmental management capabilities will be&#13;
included in the project (see Annex4.5, parts B, C, and D).&#13;
4.20  Environmental issues associated with the Waigaoqiao project component (power&#13;
plant, transmission line, coal delivery, ash management, cooling system, etc.) and&#13;
addressed in the EA included all concerns expressed by affected people in a public&#13;
meeting (conducted on December 9, 1996). The local population and local environmental&#13;
authorities support the project and the mitigating measures recommended in the EA. The&#13;
technical assistance programs, mitigating and monitoring plans presented in Annex 4.5&#13;
will be fully implemented.&#13;
4.21  Key issues addressed in the EA included air pollution (dust, sulfur dioxide,&#13;
nitrogen oxides from boiler operation and coal and ash storage and conveyance), noise,&#13;
surface water pollution (thermal pollution, and material contamination of the Yangtze&#13;
River from coal transfer/storage and noncooling effluent discharges), electric field&#13;
strength (transmission lines), industrial hazards, and worker health and safety. No PCBs&#13;
(polychlorinated biphenyls) will be used in the substations to be financed and bidding&#13;
documents will note this restriction accordingly. In addition, as mentioned above, the&#13;
Waigaoqiao project is the second phase of an overall program to develop approximately&#13;
5,000 MW  thermal power at the Pudong site.  To plan for any future adverse&#13;
environmental consequences, the EA examined: (a) individual and cumulative impacts&#13;
from the Phase I project (1,200 MW) nearing completion; (b) the current proposed Phase&#13;
II project (1,800-2,000 MW); and (c) the planned Phase III project (1,800-2,000 MW).&#13;
4.22  All mitigating measures for air, water, solids, noise, electric fields, etc.,&#13;
incorporated in the Waigaoqiao project component are designed to meet appropriate&#13;
Chinese requirements or World Bank guidelines, whichever is stricter. In the absence of&#13;
either, international standards or codes of good practice will be used. Assurances were&#13;
obtained from SMEPC that it will carry out the Environmental Management Program in&#13;
a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
D. RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.23  The project design focused on minimizing the scope of resettlement. Where land&#13;
acquisition and demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the resettlement action&#13;
plan (RAP) provides for replacement of housing, alternative employment, infrastructure,&#13;
services and other resources. The proposed RAP aims at: (a) improving the living&#13;
standard of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) or at least restoring them; (b) compensating&#13;
the villages for land and the PAPs for their lost assets at replacement value without&#13;
depreciation; (c) providing nonfarm jobs for the farmers who lost their land;&#13;
(d) compensating the disrupted infrastructure; (e) establishing the time schedule and&#13;
budget of the resettlement component of the project; (f) developing a mechanism for&#13;
grievance and appeals; and (g) establishing a system for both internal and external&#13;
monitoring. The base cost of land acquisition and resettlement are estimated at Y 348&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
million (for the power plant component only). A RAP has been prepared to comply with&#13;
appropriate Chinese policies and World Bank guidelines (OD 4.30).&#13;
4.24  The project requires:  (a) acquisition of 1,555 mu (103.7/ha) of land;&#13;
(b) demolition of 40,639 m2 of floor space; and (c) relocation of 274 households and 17&#13;
township or village enterprises. Overall, about 1,933 people will be affected by the&#13;
project (see Ainnx4.7).&#13;
4.25  Arrangements for relocation, prepared in collaboration with local authorities and&#13;
the population affected by the project, are in line with Chinese national and local policies.&#13;
Special attention was given to the most vulnerable groups (households headed by women,&#13;
senior people and poorest households). The new housing area is within several hundred&#13;
meters of Gaodong Town, a few kilometers from existing villages. Households displaced&#13;
by the project will be given a choice to: (a) relocate in newly built apartment buildings&#13;
with modem facilities and necessary community services; or (b) rebuild new houses&#13;
according to the standards of old houses. All farmers who lost land due to the project&#13;
will be assigned nonfarm jobs with monthly wages higher than their present income.&#13;
Assurances were obtained from SMEPC that it will carry out a resettlement program for&#13;
the Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant (Phase II) in accordance with the agreed&#13;
resettlement plan.&#13;
4.26 According to the Master Plan of the Municipality of Shanghai, all of the&#13;
associated 500 kV Transmission Component (50 km in length) will be located on the&#13;
Greenbelt, which is going to be constructed in conjunction with a ring road around&#13;
Shanghai. There will be no other land acquisition or resettlement attributable to the&#13;
transmission line construction. Land required for transmission line towers will amount to&#13;
13,000 square meters out of the 450 hectares of the entire greenbelt. Assurances were&#13;
also obtained from SMEPC that, if and to the extent there are any PAPs as a result of&#13;
construction of the transmission component and Sanlin substation, SMEPC will carry out&#13;
the resettlement program in accordance with a RAP acceptable to the Bank&#13;
4.27  The 500 kV transmission lines will be connected to the Yanggao and the&#13;
Yanghang substations. Yanggao is an existing substation already in operation and does&#13;
not require new land acquisition.  The construction of Yanghang substation will&#13;
commence in 1997 affecting 24 households and acquiring 142 mu of land (including 128&#13;
mu of arable land and 3,859 square meters of housing). 140 PAPs will either be&#13;
re-employed in enterprises or retired. The construction will not affect any enterprises of&#13;
public buildings. The resettlement of the PAPs at the Yanghang Substation site will be&#13;
undertaken according to the policy in the RAP for the Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant.&#13;
An implementation plan (including the impact, budget, schedule, exact description of&#13;
entitlements and organizational responsibility for implementation) of these PAPs will be&#13;
prepared as soon as the Shanghai Municipal Government authorizes the commencement&#13;
of land acquisition and a formal census of the PAPs and their assets can be undertaken.&#13;
The implementation plan will be submitted to the Bank for review. Assurances were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
obtained from SMEPC that it will submit an implementation plan, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, no later than January 31, 1998.&#13;
4.28  A  Project Resettlement Office has been established within the Project&#13;
Preparation/Construction Department of SMEPC to oversee the management and&#13;
implementation of resettlement program.  It will be assisted by Gaodong Town&#13;
Government Resettlement Office. One senior member of the office has received training&#13;
on resettlement monitoring and evaluation sponsored by ODA and the World Bank.&#13;
4.29  SMEPC has contracted Shanghai Academy of Social Science, Center of&#13;
Economics and Law to monitor the resettlement activities and provide an independent&#13;
evaluation of resettlement. A working plan has been developed and included in the RAP.&#13;
The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure that the resettlement program is&#13;
implemented smoothly and that living standard of the PAPs are restored.&#13;
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.30  SMEPC will be responsible for construction and operation of the Waigaoqiao&#13;
Phase II Thermal Power Project. Its organizational structure for project management is&#13;
shown in Chart 3.  SMEPC has had substantial experience in power generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution, and has been operating Shanghai Municipal Power Grid&#13;
since 1986. It also has operating experience of supercritical units ( 2x600 MW coal-fired&#13;
thermal units at Shidongkou No. 2 Power Plant). Preparatory works including access&#13;
roads and construction power supply started in January 1997 and have been progressing&#13;
satisfactorily. The bidding documents for the procurement of the main boiler and turbine-&#13;
generator packages are scheduled to be issued in June 1997 and opened in&#13;
October/November 1997. The commercial operation of the first generating unit is&#13;
expected in May 2003 and the second unit in May 2004. Thus, the project completion&#13;
date would be July 31, 2005 and the closing date of the Bank loan would be January&#13;
2006. Chart 4 presents the implementation schedule for the project. Furthermore, key&#13;
dates of project implementation are given in Annex 4.8.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATE&#13;
4.31  The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,656.6 million equivalent, excluding&#13;
interest during construction (IDC), of which $830.6 million (50.1 percent) represents the&#13;
foreign exchange component. Table 4.1 provides a summary of the estimated project&#13;
cost. The cost estimates reflect end- 1996 prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at&#13;
10 percent for civil works and locally supplied equipment, and 5 percent for imported&#13;
equipment and consulting services. Price-contingency allowances for foreign costs&#13;
estimated in US dollars are calculated according to anticipated international price&#13;
increases (in percent) of 1.7 for 1997, 2.2 for 1998, 2.6 for 1999, 2.8 for 2000, 2.6 for&#13;
2001, 2.5 for 2002, and 2.3 for 2003-2005. The price escalation for costs expressed in&#13;
local currency is calculated according to projected local inflation rates (in percent) of 6.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
for 1997, 5.8 for 1998, 5.5 for 1999, and thereafter. The prevailing exchange rate during&#13;
appraisal (Y 8.2958=$1) is used in the cost estimates.&#13;

G. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.32 The total financing requirements (including IDC of $241.4 million equivalent),&#13;
are estimated at $1,898 million equivalent. The financing plan for the overall project is&#13;
shown in Table 4.2. The local costs estimated at $826 million equivalent and IDC for the&#13;
local and a part of IDC for foreign loans estimated at $172 million equivalent will be&#13;
financed by: (a) SMEPC self-generated funds and funds raised from sales of shares of the&#13;
generating company; (b) convertible loans from Shenergy and ECEPGC; and&#13;
(c) commercial loans from two local banks. Financing from the first two sources, $542.4&#13;
million equivalent, will constitute about 33 percent of the total project cost and represent&#13;
about 28.6 percent of the total financing required. The remaining financing requirements&#13;
of about $455.6 million equivalent will be covered by borrowings from two local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
commercial banks arranged by the SMEPC, Shenergy, and ECEPGC in the proportion of&#13;
40, 40, and 20 percent.&#13;
4.33  The foreign exchange required for the project ($830.6 million) and a part of IDC&#13;
(about $69.4 million) together estimated at $900 million will be financed by the proposed&#13;
Bank loan of $400 million and cofinancing of $500 million. The Beneficiary and the&#13;
Government will explore cofinancing options: (a) export credits for a part of major&#13;
equipment in the amount of approximately $155 million upon the selection of lowest&#13;
evaluated bidder scheduled in February 1998; (b) Japan EXIM's untied loan in the&#13;
amount of up to 5 billion Yen equivalent under Accelerated Cofinancing Facility (ACF)&#13;
for the environmental protection component; and/or (c) commercial cofinancing. MOF&#13;
would become a Chinese counterpart (the borrower in the case of buyer credits) in export&#13;
credit financing and the borrower for JEXIM loan for the Project. Under the proposed&#13;
qualification criteria for the major equipment packages, including turbine generator and&#13;
boiler, it is expected that all the eligible suppliers are able to arrange export credit&#13;
cofinancing. Application for provision of an untied loan has already been filed with&#13;
Japan EXIM.&#13;
4.34  In the case that export credits and/or Japan EXIM's untied loan would not be&#13;
available in a timely and satisfactory manner for China, or in a sufficient amount to fill&#13;
the funding gap, the Government will secure necessary funds through commercial&#13;
cofinancing. The borrower of such cofinancing would be the Government of China&#13;
represented by MOF, and the proceeds of the financing would be onlent to the&#13;
Beneficiary, which would be the same arrangement with previous cofinancing operations&#13;
and Bank direct loans for China. It is expected that China would be able to raise up to&#13;
$500 million in commercial loan/bond markets with sufficiently long maturity (10-20&#13;
years) without a partial credit guarantee of the Bank, if the current market conditions&#13;
prevail. It is especially the case, if China borrows necessary funds in tranches (e.g.,&#13;
issuance of bonds with different maturity) and/or with intervals (e.g., a series of loan&#13;
syndication or the combination of bond issuance and loan syndication at different timing).&#13;
4.35  It is expected that China would tap the commercial market after the approval of&#13;
the proposed loan by the Board, after the exploration of export credits/official&#13;
cofinancing, and by the time of actual disbursement for the major equipment scheduled to&#13;
start in late 1999. The Bank will provide the cofinancing framework (provision of an&#13;
optional cross default clause) for such borrowing by China. The Bank will also consider&#13;
the provision of a partial credit guarantee, at then minimum necessary level, if such a&#13;
guarantee would be required by the Government due to market conditions at the time of&#13;
its financing for the Project. Such guarantee operation, if any, would be sent to the Board&#13;
for approval on a stand-alone basis.&#13;
4.36 The proposed Bank loan of $400 million will be made to the Government of&#13;
China at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency&#13;
loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 6-year grace period. Proceeds of the loan&#13;
would be onlent from the Government to SMEPC through the Shanghai Municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Government on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. The Government of&#13;
China and SMEPC have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms for&#13;
the project to: (a) facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their borrowing&#13;
by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net trade&#13;
flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated; and (b) preserve the full&#13;
maturity of the loan and the lower annuity payment in early years, compared to the fixed-&#13;
rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan and higher level annual payments&#13;
during the initial operational period.&#13;

4.37  Assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that it will onlend the proceeds of&#13;
the proposed Bank loan to SMEPC through SMG under a subsidiary loan agreement with&#13;
a term of 20 years, including 6-year grace period, at a variable rate equal to the Bank&#13;
rate. SMEPC will bear the foreign exchange risk. Execution of the subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements between the Government and SMEPC, satisfactory to the Bank, and approval&#13;
of the Loan Agreement by the State Council would be conditions of loan effectiveness.&#13;
H. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.38  Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 and the related&#13;
procurement schedules for various packages are given in Annex 4.9. The Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
1996) will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Bank loan will be largely&#13;
disbursed against the boiler and turbine-generator packages through international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB). Some specialized equipment estimated to cost less than&#13;
$300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $6 million and which can only be&#13;
purchased from a limited number of suppliers, regardless of the cost thereof, will be&#13;
procured through limited international bidding (LIB).  Goods, instruments and&#13;
accessories needed for construction and operation of the power plant, including&#13;
equipment for environmental monitoring and training, which are readily available&#13;
off-the-shelf or are standard specification commodities, and which are estimated to cost&#13;
less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, will be&#13;
procured through contracts awarded on the basis of:  (a) international shopping&#13;
procedures for up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million, by soliciting&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers in two different countries; or (b) national&#13;
shopping procedures for up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000, with the&#13;
prior agreement of the Bank. Goods of a proprietary nature may be procured through&#13;
direct contracting with the Bank's prior agreement up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed $500,000.&#13;
4.39  Two contracts, amounting to about $5.0 million in total for consulting services,&#13;
will be awarded in accordance with new Bank Guidelines for Selection and Employment&#13;
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997). These include construction&#13;
management (1 contract) and technical assistance for SMEPC's financial management&#13;
systems (1 contract). Selection of consultants for financial management systems will be&#13;
carried out through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS).  Procurement of&#13;
construction management services will apply Single-Source Selection method given the&#13;
necessity of continuity for Phase III construction work. For complex, time-based&#13;
assignments, such contracts shall be based on the standard forrn of contract for&#13;
consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have&#13;
been agreed by the Bank.&#13;
4.40 In ICB procurement, model bidding documents developed in consultation with the&#13;
Bank would be used. Standard bid evaluation forms for procurement of Goods and&#13;
Works (April 1996) would be used. Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible&#13;
for a margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or the actual customs duty,&#13;
whichever is lower, in evaluation of bids.&#13;
4.41  For the procurement of those contracts for goods and works not financed by the&#13;
Bank loan, the Borrower may adopt other procedures. In such cases the Bank shall be&#13;
satisfied that the procedures to be used will fulfill the Borrower's obligations to cause the&#13;
project to be carried out diligently and efficiently. (Reference paragraphs 1.5 and 3.14 of&#13;
the "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," January 1995,&#13;
revised January and August 1996).&#13;
4.42  Because of foreign exchange limitations, civil works and some equipment not&#13;
financed by the Bank will be procured locally through competitive bidding procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed components&#13;
will not adversely affect the execution of the project in terms of cost, quality or&#13;
completion time.&#13;
4.43    Prior review   would  apply  to  all Bank  financed  contracts  for goods, with  an&#13;
estimated cost of $5 million equivalent or above (about 95 percent of the loan). Other&#13;
contracts would be subject to selective post-award review. Prior review would also be&#13;
required for all consultant contracts with an estimated cost exceeding $50,000 for&#13;
individuals, or $100,000 for firms. Exceptions to prior review would not apply to the&#13;
terms of reference for all consultant contracts and single-source selection of consulting&#13;
firms.&#13;
4.44    The invitation to prequalify or bid for each contract estimated to cost $10,000,000&#13;
equivalent or more shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to&#13;
large contracts under paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines. All contracts above $200,000 for&#13;
consulting services shall be advertised to obtain expressions of interest prior to the&#13;
preparation of the short list.&#13;

I. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.45  The Bank loan will be disbursed against:  (a) 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a c.i.f. basis;&#13;
(b) 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items; (c) 75&#13;
percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and (d) 100 percent of the&#13;
expenditure for consulting services and training. For expenditures pertaining to goods&#13;
contracts valued at less than $5,000,000, consultancy contracts valued at less than&#13;
$100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals and all training, reimbursement will be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures. Supporting documents need not be&#13;
submitted to the Bank but will be retained in SMEPC's office for review by Bank&#13;
supervision missions. To facilitate disbursements under this project, a Special Account&#13;
will be established for SMEPC with an authorized allocation of $15 million, representing&#13;
approximately four months of average project disbursements.  Applications for&#13;
replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts withdrawn equal 50&#13;
percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner. Retroactive financing in an&#13;
aggregate amount of $5 million, or 1.3 percent of the loan, would be provided for&#13;
anticipated expenditures incurred before the signing of the loan. Annex 4.10 presents the&#13;
disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan as well as a standard profile of&#13;
disbursements for power sector in China. The disbursements are expected to be&#13;
completed in eight years for the project, very close to the standard disbursement profile&#13;
for the power sector in China. The last year is for payment of retention money. The&#13;
annual estimated contractual and other payments are presented in Table 4.4.&#13;
J. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
4.46 Understandings were reached at appraisal concerning procedures and satisfactory&#13;
performance indicators for monitoring and reporting.  Reporting would include&#13;
semiannual project implementation reports covering all project components. A rolling&#13;
financial plan would also be submitted annually. The scope and content of the project&#13;
progress reports have also been agreed. The Bank supervision plan in Annx 4.11 will&#13;
focus on the core activities of project implementation and achievement of agreed&#13;
objectives. The Key Project Performance Indicators are described in Annex 4. 1.&#13;
4.47  With regard to the construction of the project, monitoring of costs, quality and&#13;
schedule is the main function of SMEPC and their consultants during the coming years.&#13;
The Bank will monitor procurement progress in accordance with the procurement&#13;
schedule in Annex 4.9, and construction progress in accordance with the schedule of&#13;
Charts 4 and key dates presented in Annex 4.8. Overall costs will be monitored in&#13;
accordance with Table 4.1. The guiding principles and implementation indicators for the&#13;
resettlement are or will be described in the RAPs submitted to the Bank or covenanted&#13;
under the proposed project.  The responsibility for environmental monitoring is&#13;
comprehensively presented in Annex 4.5.&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
5.1   SMEPC follows MOF financial regulations applicable to state-owned enterprises.&#13;
The financial regulations promulgated by MOF have gradually evolved over the last&#13;
decade from a system in which all investment funds were provided by the Government&#13;
and all surpluses remitted to it, to one which provides some autonomy and incentives for&#13;
efficiency. Overall, the new accounting principles effective July 1, 1993 are generally&#13;
consistent with international accounting standards and financial rules. They will, together&#13;
with the rationalization of state assets management and other fiscal and financial sector&#13;
reforms, further increase the accountability of the management of power entities.&#13;
5.2   The Government promulgated a series of important tax laws at the end of 1993. A&#13;
unified corporate income tax rate of 33 percent is being applied to all domestic&#13;
enterprises. A new 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) replaced the old 25 percent sales&#13;
tax for power generation and distribution. The new tax policy is more transparent and&#13;
eliminates the lengthy and complicated negotiations between enterprises and the&#13;
Government. It is also conducive to better planning and financial management in the&#13;
power companies.&#13;
5.3   One of the Government's sectoral objectives is to strengthen the enterprises'&#13;
financial management so that the power companies could operate effectively in a market-&#13;
oriented environment. Toward this end, the proposed project would focus on the&#13;
institutional building aspect and include: (a) technical assistance to develop and improve&#13;
the accounting and financial management systems of the SMEPC (para. 3.11); and&#13;
(b) agreements with SMEPC on financial performance targets to ensure disciplined and&#13;
sound financial management (para. 5.6).&#13;
B. SMEPC's FINANCES&#13;
Past Finances and Present Financial Position&#13;
5.4   SMEPC's financial performance was satisfactory in the past. It has been able to&#13;
meet the financial covenants in connection with the previous Bank-financed Wujing&#13;
Thermal Power Project (Loan 2852-CHA). SMEPC's income statements, funds flow&#13;
statements and balance sheets for the period 1993-96 are set out in Annex 5.1. Salient&#13;
points and features highlighting SMEPC's past and present finances are summarized in&#13;

*   Based on 1996 unaudited accounts.&#13;
** Excluding Value-added tax (VAT).&#13;
*   Return on equity (equity base includes paid-in capital and retained earnings).&#13;
5.5    During the period 1993-96, SMEPC reported modest profits with net profitability&#13;
on equity in the range of 6-10 percent, which is higher than the average in the country.&#13;
The declining trend is due to the changes taking place in the accounting treatments for&#13;
depreciation and interest expenses over the period, as well as the new tax laws enacted in&#13;
1994. SMEPC's operating revenue increased by 50 percent from 1993 to 1996 due to&#13;
higher average tariff and energy sales. However, its operating expenses increased even&#13;
faster at a rate of 69 percent over the same period with 130 percent increase in the&#13;
depreciation charge. SMEPC has maintained a rather conservative capital structure with&#13;
debt not exceeding 44.8 percent of total debt and equity over years. Its liquidity position&#13;
is somewhat distorted as both accounts receivable and payable to a large extent reflected&#13;
the position of surcharges collected on behalf of different government agencies.&#13;
Financial Performance Targets&#13;
5.6    To promote prudent and sound financial management and adequate tariffs,&#13;
assurances were obtainedfrom SMEPC that it will:&#13;
(a)    take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments,&#13;
to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt service&#13;
coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 times at all times;&#13;
(b)    take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustrnents,&#13;
to earn an annual return on equity (includes paid-in capital and retained&#13;
earnings) of not less than 8 percent in 1998-1999, 10 percent in 2000-&#13;
2001, 12 percent in 2002-2003, and 15 percent in 2004 and thereafter; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(c)   by June I of each year, furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial&#13;
plan containing projected income statements, funds flow statements, and&#13;
balance sheets.&#13;
5.7   The above financial performance targets will be reviewed and reformulated as&#13;
appropriate based on the financial positions of SMEPC after its restructuring.&#13;
Achievement of these objectives will require substantial tariff increases. Projections,&#13;
presented in Table 5.2, show that SMEPC's average price must increase by a minimum of&#13;
about 8.4 percent (3.0 percent in real terms) per year from 1996 to 2004 to achieve the&#13;
target return on equity of 15 percent.&#13;
Future Finances&#13;
5.8   The projections of SMEPC's finances for 1997-2005 are presented in Annex 5.2,&#13;
and the salient features of these finances are highlighted in Table 5.2. The projections are&#13;
based on the assumptions contained in Annex 5.3.&#13;
5.9   Table 5.2 shows the projected price increases of purchased power, SMEPC's self&#13;
generated power, and the weighted average of those two that will be required to meet the&#13;
financial covenants. The prices for purchased power will be determined on a plant-by-&#13;
plant basis, at "debt service price" levels, allowing for full debt service based on 7-8 year&#13;
pay back period after commissioning of new power plants.&#13;
5.10  SMEPC's financial position, however, depends mostly on revenues that it collects&#13;
from its self-generated power. In order to meet the expansion plan and projected cost&#13;
increases in the future and comply with the financial performance targets set forth above,&#13;
SMEPC's average sale price will need to increase by an estimated 7.9 percent in current&#13;
terms or 2.5 percent in real terms a year from 1996 to 2005. Given the current catalogue&#13;
prices, 29.6 fen/kWh in 1995, the average price of SMEPC's self generated power needs&#13;
to be more than doubled over the period.&#13;
5.11  Although the rate of increases in the catalogue prices needed for SMEPC are&#13;
large, much of the increase should stem from the entry of new generating plant into the&#13;
rate base. Because of the rapid load growth, the bulk of the tariff increase required will&#13;
be met through implementation of the new pricing principles. At the end of 1996, more&#13;
than half of SMEPC's own generation came from plants built since 1993.&#13;
5.12  During the period 1996-2005, SMEPC needs to maintain relatively high rates of&#13;
growth to meet the electricity demand required by the sustained strong economic growth&#13;
in the Shanghai area (projected annual growth of 10-12 percent). Based on the latest&#13;
demand forecast and expansion plan assumptions, energy sales are expected to rise by&#13;
128 percent over 1996 levels, representing an average annual growth rate of about 9.6&#13;
percent. SMEPC's annual investment program and net fixed assets in operation are&#13;
expected to increase by about 50 percent and more than two folds over the period, an&#13;
annual increase of about 4.5 and 15.7 percent, respectively.&#13;

5.13  From 1996 on, SMEPC's performance is anticipated to improve gradually and&#13;
steadily as the tariff level of SMEPC's own generation is increased to meet the financial&#13;
targets, from 42.97 fen/kWh (including VAT) in 1996 to 81.82 fen/kWh in 2005 and the&#13;
tariff structure is further rationalized. The rate of return requirement emerges as an&#13;
important determinant of future price levels. Based on the projected minimum tariff&#13;
level, about 7.8 percent increase per year for its own generation and 8.2 percent for&#13;
purchased power from 1996 to 2005, both revenues and net income are expected to grow&#13;
considerably over the period. SMEPC is also expected to maintain and further strengthen&#13;
its sound financial position with all key indicators improving over the projection period.&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISK&#13;
Least Cost Analysis&#13;
6.1   The Shanghai Municipal area is the fastest growing industrial and commercial&#13;
base in China. However, it has no hydroelectric potential or coal resources. During the&#13;
last decade, it relied mostly on imported high quality coal from Shanxi Province and&#13;
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for its power generation. In the late 1980s, power&#13;
generators in the Municipality started building large technologically advanced coal-fired&#13;
units to meet the fast growing demand with minimum impact on the environment. With&#13;
stricter municipal regulations introduced in 1995, investments in environmental&#13;
protection (especially for sulfur dioxide removal) are expected to increase. Studies to&#13;
introduce gas-fired combined cycle units are being jointly conducted with neighboring&#13;
provinces.&#13;
6.2   During the preparation of the project, a least-cost expansion study was carried out&#13;
by the Beijing Economic Research Institute for Water Resources and Electric Power&#13;
(referred to as BERI), covering 1997-2028 (study period) with a focus on 1997-2010&#13;
(planning period).  The study was carried out using an optimization model that&#13;
determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand with the&#13;
minimum cost (net present value of investment and operating costs), and gradually&#13;
improve the reliability of supply (maximum loss of load probability: 2 percent in 2001&#13;
and 2002; 1 percent in 2003 and 2004; and 0.5 percent in 2005 to the end of the study&#13;
period).  It considered all potential candidates including:  (a) power imports from&#13;
different coal-fired power plants in Shanxi Province (900 MW units); (b) 300 MW&#13;
natural gas fueled combined cycle units; (c) 300, 600 and 900 MW super and subcritical&#13;
coal-fired units in the Shanghai area; and (d) gas turbines (100 MW units). Two system&#13;
optimizations were carried out: (a) the first one (base case) without consideration of the&#13;
cost of installation of the FGD in Shidongkou Power Plant because the proposed project&#13;
meets Bank standards without FGD; and (b) the second using, for all potential coal-fired&#13;
candidates in the Shanghai Municipal area, investment costs that include the cost of&#13;
installation of FGD at Shidongkou. This approach assumes that the "bubble concept" is&#13;
applicable to all potential coal-fired candidates in Shanghai to meet the Municipality's&#13;
new environmental regulations. In both cases, considering economic costs for all&#13;
candidates and a discount rate of 12 percent, the study showed that the expansion&#13;
program should, up to the year 2010, be based mostly on rehabilitation of existing&#13;
300MW, construction of 600 and 900MW coal-fired supercritical units in Shanghai, and&#13;
natural gas fueled combined cycle units for base and medium load and gas turbines for&#13;
peak load The proposed project is, in both cases, the first investment of the optimal&#13;
(east-cost) power development program. In the without Waigaoqiao case, the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
investment of the least-cost power expansion program would consist of three 600 MW-&#13;
supercritical coal-fired units in the Shanghai area.&#13;
6.3   Sensitivity analyses on the base case confirmed the robustness of the proposed&#13;
project, which remains the first investment of the expansion program under a wide range&#13;
of assumptions:&#13;
(a)   the project will still be required by year 2003-04, even if the demand&#13;
growth would slow from the projected 9 percent per year to only 7.2&#13;
percent during 1995-2005, and remains at 5.6 percent during 2005-2010; if&#13;
the demand would grow at 6 percent during 1995-2005, the first unit will&#13;
still be needed in 2003 and the second unit delayed by one year only;&#13;
(b)   the project would be less economical than an equivalent combined cycle&#13;
power plant only if the investment cost of the latter were 15 percent lower&#13;
than in the base case ($390/kW installed compared to $460/kW installed),&#13;
or cost of gas at the plant gate were about 15 percent lower than in the&#13;
base case ($3.9/MBTU compared to $4.4/MBTU in the base case).&#13;
However, it should be noted that gas availability in the Shanghai area is&#13;
not expected before 2005; and&#13;
(c)   the project would be less economical than power imports from Shanxi&#13;
Province only if the cost of the coal at mine mouth were 80 percent lower&#13;
than in the base case (Y 35/tce compared to Y 177/tce in the base case).&#13;
6.4   Summaries of the least cost study and the power development program (1995-&#13;
2005) for the SMPG is given in Annex 6.1. The balances between power demand and&#13;
supply are presented in Annex 6.2.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return&#13;
6.5   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the proposed project was&#13;
calculated based on the estimated plant gate power price of 47 fen/kWh (in 1995 prices)&#13;
in 2003, the first year of operation. This estimate is based on existing policies for power&#13;
pricing from new power plants and prices currently paid by SMEPC to recently&#13;
completed coal-fired base load power plants. It yielded an IERR of about 19.3 percent.&#13;
This IERR, based on revenues generated by the new power plant rather than the economic&#13;
value of a shortfall in electric power supply, underestimates the economic benefits of the&#13;
project. If the cost of the installation of the FGD in Shidongkou power plant is added to&#13;
the proposed cost of the project without consideration of the benefits of reduction in&#13;
sulfur dioxide emissions, the IERR would be reduced to 18.2 percent.5&#13;
5 It should be noted that the IERR was calculated based on the very conservative assumption of 5600 h of&#13;
operation at full capacity (equivalent to a load factor of 63.5 percnt). If the power plant is operated at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47 -&#13;
6.6   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the case of&#13;
one of the following occurrences:&#13;
(a)   the price paid at the plant gate for electricity were about 29 percent lower&#13;
than the base case price, i.e., 33.4 fen/kWh instead of 47 fen/kWh in 1995&#13;
prices; it should be noted that the break-even price is 22 percent lower&#13;
than the current average power sales price in Shanghai;&#13;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of more than 60 percent;&#13;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to about 3450 hours per year&#13;
instead of about 5570 hours;&#13;
(d)   the economic fuel cost were 122 percent higher than the base case;&#13;
(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of more than 4&#13;
years.&#13;
6.7   However, these occurrences are very unlikely because SMEPC has a very good&#13;
record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case&#13;
are conservative, and the power purchase agreement and the financial covenants of the&#13;
project would ensure that prices are high enough to meet the economic viability&#13;
requirements.&#13;
full capacity during 6500 h (equivalent to a load factor of 74 percent), the IERR would increase to 22.6&#13;
percent.&#13;

Environmental Benefits&#13;
6.8   BERI also conducted an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the&#13;
project based on: (a) "adjusted estimates" of the monetary damages caused by air&#13;
pollution during the study period, based on the New York State Externality Model (Rowe&#13;
et al., 1994); and (b) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to&#13;
evaluate the monetary damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The adjustment&#13;
(transfer) factor takes into account the differences in population density and standard of&#13;
living. The low estimate is based on a transfer factor using GDP and the high estimate is&#13;
based on power purchase parity in the Shanghai area.&#13;
6.9   The results of the evaluation showed that if the value of the environmental&#13;
impacts is added to the project cost, the IERR of the project would be reduced to&#13;
17.3/15.6 (low/high) percent.&#13;
6.10  BERI also carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the FGD component of the project&#13;
adjusting estimates of monetary benefits of the reduced sulfur dioxide emissions in New&#13;
York State to Shanghai Municipality based on Power Purchase Parity. The method&#13;
yielded an IERR of 20.7 percent. It should, however, be noted that if the transfer is&#13;
based on GDP, the IERR would be only 8.7 percent.&#13;
Project Risk&#13;
6.11  To complement the above deterministic approach, risk analyses have been&#13;
performed using a probabilistic method to assess the impact of the perceived risk factors&#13;
that might affect the return of the project.&#13;
6.12  Four broad categories of risk have been considered in the analysis:&#13;
(a)   Demand Risk. Demand risk is related to lower load growth than expected&#13;
and/or breach of contract by the purchaser. Demand risk is not perceived&#13;
as a major risk factor in the short-term with energy shortages prevailing in&#13;
the Shanghai Municipal Power Grid. However, a low-load growth and/or&#13;
an important reduction in electricity off take could jeopardize the&#13;
economic viability of the project.&#13;
(b)   Price Risk. Price risk is related to the willingness and ability of the power&#13;
purchaser to pay and/or changes in pricing policy. This risk is normally&#13;
mitigated or managed through long-term contractual arrangements and/or&#13;
the financial covenants of the project. However, experience shows that the&#13;
seller could still be confronted with unexpected price changes.&#13;
(c)   Cost Risk. Higher than estimated project cost usually results from:&#13;
(a) Higher equipment prices. The major equipment and facilities of&#13;
generation will be purchased through international competitive bidding.&#13;
Prices  could,  therefore,  be  affected  by  market  fluctuations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
(b) Construction cost overrun. Cost overrun during construction period is&#13;
a common phenomena for many infrastructure projects. They are caused&#13;
by a number of factors, in particular, delay of construction due to&#13;
interfacing problems between different suppliers, unforeseen site&#13;
conditions and inadequate construction management; and (c) Coal prices.&#13;
Coal prices increase would result in a major operating cost increase of the&#13;
power plant. It is likely that the coal price would stay stable in the initial&#13;
years. However, it is possible that at later stages of the project lifetime&#13;
there might be a coal price increase due to more stringent enviromnental&#13;
constraints (higher price for better quality coal, requirement to wash the&#13;
lower quality coal, etc.).&#13;
(d)    Operational Performance Risk. Poor operational performance could be&#13;
caused  by:   (a) low  quality  of generating  equipment and  facilities;&#13;
(b) below standard coal; and (c) inadequate maintenance and poor&#13;
management.&#13;
6.13   Based on the foregoing considerations and extensive sensitivity analyses, five&#13;
variables have been selected as the crucial risk variables because of their significant&#13;
impact on the project economic viability. Table 6.2 presents the selected variables, the&#13;
assumed value ranges, and the probability distributions attached to them based on past&#13;
Bank experience in power projects in general and China in particular.&#13;

6.14   The risk analysis was carried out with the Risk Master computer software which&#13;
uses Monte Carlo simulation6 technique. The spreadsheet employed for the risk analysis&#13;
is based on the base case cost/benefit analysis (see Table 6.1). The correlation between&#13;
risk variables is explicitly considered prior to the simulation to avoid generation of&#13;
unrealistic project scenarios. For instance, variations of output and cost are correlated&#13;
with the construction lead time.&#13;
6.15   The results, based on 1,000 simulations, are sumnmarized in Table 6.3 and Figure&#13;
6.1.&#13;
TABLE 6.3: EXPECTED IERR AND VARIANCE&#13;
Expected IERR                        17.50%&#13;
Standard deviation                    2.30%&#13;
Minimum                              11.40%&#13;
Maximum                              24.80%&#13;
Coefficient of variation              0.13&#13;
Probability of negative outcome       0.00%&#13;
6.16 The expected IERR, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations&#13;
is 17.5 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.3 percent), about 2 percent lower than the&#13;
base case value without consideration of project risks. The minimum and maximum&#13;
IERR, under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 11.4 and 24.8 percent. The&#13;
probability of a negative outcome (negative net present value) is zero. And finally, the&#13;
probability for the IERR to be below the considered discount rate is negligible.&#13;
6.17   All the above analyses clearly show that the project is robust under future&#13;
uncertainties and that the risk (margin of error) associated with it is acceptable. The&#13;
potential risks associated with power plant construction, cost overruns, and&#13;
implementation delays have been addressed through advanced procurement actions,&#13;
timely staffing and training of personnel of SMEPC, and the assistance provided by&#13;
highly experienced international engineering consultants.&#13;
6 Monte Carlo simulation works by generating a series of random numbers following the distribution of&#13;
probability of each risk variable. For each simulation which represents a combination of different state&#13;
of 5 variables, IERR is calculated and recorded. The results of 1000 simulations are averaged.&#13;

Project Sustainability and Risks.&#13;
6.18  Financial sustainability of the project is ensured through suitable financial&#13;
performance covenants. Moreover, existing pricing policy ensures that project costs will&#13;
be fully recovered and passed on to the consumers. For example, the average wholesale&#13;
price for Waigaoqiao phase I power plant was 57 fen/kWh in 1996. The market risk is&#13;
minimum because of the acute shortages and expected sustained growth in the Shanghai&#13;
Municipality.&#13;
6.19  Cost overrun risks have been minimized through thorough review of international&#13;
costs for similar projects and costs of existing 600 MW supercritical in China, especially&#13;
the Shidongkou No. 2 Power Plant in Shanghai. The risk of delay in project construction&#13;
due to project management shortcomings is minimal because of the skills and experience&#13;
of SMEPC's engineers, managers, and local and international engineering consultants.&#13;
Risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and implementation delays are&#13;
within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed supervision and involvement of&#13;
competent consultants. Particular attention will be given to the safety aspects of the&#13;
project, and to capability and performance of major contractors.  The risk of&#13;
nonperformance in the environmental and resettlement area has been addressed by the&#13;
establishment of appropriate monitoring organizations and procedures.   More&#13;
importantly, sensitivity analyses show that even in the case of substantial increase in the&#13;
cost, the project would remain economically viable.&#13;
6.20  Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner&#13;
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of&#13;
the sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of SMEPC. This risk is minimized&#13;
by the strong commitment of Chinese to reform both at the central and municipal level.&#13;
The agreed upon power sector restructuring program especially the separation of&#13;
generation from transmission and distribution, the listing of the generation company, and&#13;
the development of efficient wholesale pricing and contractual arrangements, will&#13;
increase the transparency and fairness of power sales/purchases and the autonomy and&#13;
accountability of all operators.&#13;

ANNEX 3.2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SMEPC&#13;
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
INFORMATION SYSTEMS&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) is responsible for the&#13;
coordination, management, operation and construction of electric power facilities in the&#13;
Shanghai Municipality of the People's Republic of China. It is a member of the East&#13;
China Electric Power Group Company and under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Electric&#13;
Power. SMEPC comprises 7 power plants, 3 power supply companies, I maintenance&#13;
service company, and 8 noncore units for design, manufacturing, fuel supply, repair,&#13;
training, and a hospital. At the end of 1995, SMEPC and its affiliated enterprises had a&#13;
total staff of about 32,000. The Shanghai Municipal Power Grid is interconnected with&#13;
the East China Power Grid which is operated by the East China Electric Power Group&#13;
Company.&#13;
2.    Like most state-owned enterprises, SMEPC is faced with the following problems:&#13;
(a) government interference in management, administrative and operational decisions&#13;
reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy; (b) lack of full&#13;
accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly centralized decision-&#13;
making and no availability of timely and accurate financial information at different&#13;
operational activity levels; (c) lack of clarity on the property rights as well as debt and&#13;
capital for jointly invested power plants, which caused enormous difficulties in company&#13;
restructuring, commercialization, and implementing corporate governance; (d) lack of&#13;
transparency of the financial situation, e.g., financial statements that are now prepared&#13;
based on the new accounting regulation effective July 1, 1993 still do not provide full&#13;
disclosure of SMEPC's financial position as the construction in progress is recorded&#13;
separately; and (e) lack of focus on the core business operations and involvement in many&#13;
activities that include profitable activities such as construction companies, design/&#13;
engineering institutes, as well as welfare responsibilities such as housing, school,&#13;
hospitals, etc.&#13;
3.    SMEPC is undertaking major changes to meet the operational challenges of power&#13;
sector reforms initiated by the Chinese Government. One of the main objectives of these&#13;
reforms is to establish a modern enterprise system characterized by clear definition of&#13;
property rights, autonomous management, commercial orientation, financial&#13;
independence, and separation government ownership and regulatory functions from&#13;
enterprise management. Moreover, SMEPC is planning a major restructuring under&#13;
which a generation company is expected to be created and listed on domestic and/or&#13;
overseas stock exchanges. These planned reforms have received support from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Chinese Government, including the Ministry of Electric Power, Shanghai Municipal&#13;
Government, State Security Supervisory Commission, and the World Bank. The reform&#13;
strategy is intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market&#13;
orientation of SMEPC.&#13;
4.    The Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) is expected to&#13;
receive a loan from the World Bank to finance the Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project&#13;
(Phase II). The project includes consultancy services to assist SMEPC in upgrading its&#13;
accounting and financial management practices and systems and developing modem,&#13;
computerized accounting and financial information systems, which will enable managers&#13;
to obtain timely information on the costs of all aspects of the company's activities. The&#13;
new systems would facilitate better budgetary control and reporting on costs and finances&#13;
to managers responsible for incurring expenditures and also for external reporting to the&#13;
Government, shareholders, lenders and the public.&#13;

ANNEX 3.3: SMEPC REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Electric Power approved a restructuring plan for the power sector&#13;
in Shanghai aimed at establishing a power purchasing agency (or single buyer) market&#13;
structure. By end-1997, all generation will be functionally separated from transmission&#13;
and distribution. The Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) will be&#13;
restructured and corporatized with core responsibility for transmission and distribution.&#13;
Before end-1 998, the generation company to be formed comprising plants spun-off from&#13;
SMEPC will publicly offer equity in domestic and international stock markets. The&#13;
public listing of the generation company has been approved by the State Securities&#13;
Conimission and the State Council.&#13;
B. REFORM OBJECTIVES &amp; PRINCIPLES&#13;
2.    The objectives and principles for power sector reform in Shanghai are:&#13;
(a)   Unbundling of generation from transmission and distribution.  The&#13;
objective of this unbundling is to create a purchasing agency structure that&#13;
will encourage competitive procurement of future generation and&#13;
encourage additional investment in generation. SMEPC will focus on the&#13;
efficient operation of the monopoly transmission and distribution network.&#13;
(b)   Efficient wholesale generation tariffs. A revised system of wholesale&#13;
electricity tariffs would be devised for power purchase from each&#13;
generating plant on the system. These tariffs should be conducive to&#13;
economic dispatch and overall generation efficiency. All power will be&#13;
purchased by the restructured SMEPC on the basis of wholesale&#13;
contractual arrangements. All generators on the system will be treated&#13;
equally and dispatched on a nondiscriminatory basis.&#13;
(c)   Private Financing of Generation. In order to raise domestic and foreign&#13;
capital efficiently on the best possible terms, the generation company&#13;
formed by the structural unbundling will be listed publicly.&#13;
C. REFORM STRATEGY &amp; IMPLEMENTATION STEPS&#13;
Existing Power Sector Structure&#13;
3.    The structure of the power sector in Shanghai is described below  and&#13;
diagrammatically represented in Figure 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                       ANNEX 3.3&#13;
(a)   Generation. The generation plant in Shanghai is all thermal. Ownership&#13;
of generation plant is very diverse with entities such as Huaneng,&#13;
Shenergy and foreign investors owning substantial stakes in generation&#13;
facilities. There is also a significant amount of on-grid plant owned by&#13;
large industries.&#13;
Generation owned 100% by SMEPC:&#13;
* Yanshupu(152 MW)&#13;
* Wujing I (350 MW)&#13;
* Nanshi (165 MW)&#13;
* Minhang (720 MW).&#13;
Generation partially owned by SMEPC:&#13;
* Zhabei Gas Turbine Power Plant (400 MW) - 70% stake&#13;
*  Wujing VI (600 MW) - ownership share under discussion&#13;
*  Zhabei (250 MW) - ownership share under discussion&#13;
*  Shidongkou (1,200 MW) - ownership share under discussion&#13;
*  Waigaoqiao 1 (1,200 MW) - 10 % stake&#13;
Generation not affiliated to SMEPC (i.e. Independent Power Plants)&#13;
* Shidongkou No. 2 (1,200 MW)&#13;
*  Gaoqiao (120 MW)&#13;
*  Xinhuo (12 MW)&#13;
*  Baogang (700 MW)&#13;
*  Jingshan (370 MW)&#13;
(b)   Transmission and Distribution. SMEPC owns and operates the Shanghai&#13;
Power Grid transmission network. This network is a major component of&#13;
the East China Electric Power Network. All plants in this network which&#13;
comprise plants listed above are dispatched by SMEPC.&#13;
SMEPC has direct ownership and control of three power supply bureaus&#13;
which cover the entire service area in the Shanghai Power Grid:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                      ANNEX 3.3&#13;
* Shanghai Urban Power Supply Bureau&#13;
* Shi-Dong Power Supply Bureau&#13;
* Shi-Nan Power Supply Bureau&#13;
(c)   Noncore Businesses&#13;
SMEPC has responsibility and ownership for eight noncore units for&#13;
manufacturing, construction, design, research, hospital, schools, etc.&#13;
Future Structure and Restructuring Plans&#13;
4.    The key power sector reform steps are described below and diagrammatically&#13;
represented in Figure 2.&#13;
(a)   Formation of a Limited Liability Shareholding Company for Generation&#13;
(i.e., The Generation Company).&#13;
All generation plant 100 percent owned by SMEPC will be spun-off to&#13;
form a separate Limited Liability generation company before end- 1997.&#13;
This company will have four stations: Yanshupu (152 MW); Wujing I&#13;
(350 MW); Nanshi (165 MW); Minhang (720 MW). It is subsequently&#13;
planned to transfer the 50 percent investment share of SMEPC and&#13;
ECEPGC in Waigaoqiao Phase I company (1,200 MW) to the Generation&#13;
Company. The remaining 50 percent is presently held by Shenergy. Once&#13;
this asset restructuring is completed the Generation Company will publicly&#13;
list about 35-40 percent of its equity. SMEPC's equity in the Generating&#13;
Company will be held by the restructured SMEPC. [See (b) below.]&#13;
(b)   Registering SMEPC as a company engaged in the core business of&#13;
transmission and distribution.&#13;
SMEPC with all its generation plant spun-off will be restructured as a&#13;
company engaged in the core business of transmission and distribution.&#13;
This company will be registered in conformance with the Chinese&#13;
Company Law. It will remain 100 percent state-owned with the State-&#13;
ownership represented by East China Electric Power Group Corporation.&#13;
The restructured SMEPC will operate as a purchasing agent (or single&#13;
buyer) for all wholesale electricity supplied to the Shanghai municipality.&#13;
It will remain responsible for the development and operation of the&#13;
transmission and distribution system, and continue to have the obligation&#13;
to serve all customers in Shanghai municipality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                       ANNEX 3.3&#13;
(c)   All other generating entities on the Shanghai power system which are&#13;
either partly-owned by SMEPC, or independent, will remain separate legal&#13;
entities contracts for long term sales of electricity to the restructured&#13;
SMEPC. SMEPC's investments in generating entities will be held by the&#13;
restructured SMEPC. Arms-length power purchase contracts will be&#13;
developed for purchases by the restructured SMEPC.&#13;
(d)   Subsidiary Companies will be formed for noncore businesses.&#13;
Target Implementation Dates&#13;
5.    The target dates for the reform are:&#13;
*  Formation of a separate generation company for the 4 plants fully-owned by&#13;
SMEPC-September 1997.&#13;
*  Corporatization of restructured SMEPC as company engaged in the core&#13;
business of transmission and distribution-December 1997.&#13;
*  Noncore businesses such as fuel supply, maintenance etc. will be transformed&#13;
into profit centers or subsidiary companies-December 1997.&#13;
*  Submission for approval of wholesale electricity pricing principles and&#13;
methodology for determining them-October 1997. (These principles and&#13;
methodology will be utilized for defining the electricity purchase contracts&#13;
between the restructured SMEPC responsible for transmission and distribution&#13;
and the generation entities.)&#13;
*  Implementation of power purchase contracts between the restructured SMEPC&#13;
responsible for transmission and distribution and all generation entities-&#13;
within one year of approval by the government.&#13;
*  Public listing of Generation Company-December 1998.&#13;
Implementation Technical Assistance&#13;
6.    SMEPC and other power sector enterprises/investors in Shanghai will require&#13;
specialized technical, financial and restructuring advisory services for the implementation&#13;
of the proposed sector structure. Assistance will be required to restructure SMEPC, form&#13;
the generation company, develop the power purchase contracts, and manage the public&#13;
listing. All the above services will be procured and financed directly by SMEPC and&#13;
concerned agencies. The World Bank will finance technical assistance required to&#13;
develop wholesale power purchase pricing methodology and contractual arrangements&#13;
between the restructured SMEPC responsible for transmission and distribution and&#13;
generation entities. This technical assistance project will commence in May 1997 and be&#13;

ANNEX 3.4: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
OF RESTRUCTURING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND&#13;
WHOLESALE POWER PURCHASE PRICING&#13;
METHODOLOGY AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION &amp; OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) is to be restructured&#13;
as a company engaged in the core business of transmission and distribution, which will be&#13;
functionally separate from all generation. Under this structure the restructured SMEPC&#13;
responsible for transmission and distribution will be the single buyer (or purchasing&#13;
agent) for all wholesale power.  To make this structure operate effectively, the&#13;
restructured SMEPC with responsibility for transmission and distribution will enter into&#13;
separate power purchase contracts with all generation entities supplying Shanghai&#13;
municipality.&#13;
2.    The advisory services are required to:  (a) define the SMEPC restructuring&#13;
strategy; and (b) develop the necessary pricing principles and contractual arrangements&#13;
for power purchases from the generation entities. These advisory services are expected to&#13;
be completed over a period of about 4 months, commencing in May 1997 and completed&#13;
by August 1997. The consultant team will work with an SMEPC Working Group&#13;
responsible for developing and implementing these wholesale power purchase contracts.&#13;
B. SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK&#13;
3.    The consulting work is divided into four main tasks:&#13;
Task 1:     Review and Detailed Development of Sector Structure&#13;
(a)   Review SMEPC's operations and organizational structure and identify the&#13;
key implementation steps for the separation of generation from&#13;
transmission and distribution.&#13;
(b)   Review existing rules and procedures for unit scheduling and load&#13;
dispatch and develop a framework transmission grid code setting out basic&#13;
technical requirements for grid connection and rules for dispatch.&#13;
(c)   Review  and propose statutory changes in regulations and other&#13;
administrative documents necessary to implement the new sector structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80-                        ANNEX 3.4&#13;
(d)   Assist in preparation of draft charters of responsibilities for the&#13;
restructured SMEPC responsible for transmission and distribution.&#13;
(e)   Clarify responsibilities for key functions such as system planning, price&#13;
setting and approval.&#13;
Task 2:     Review of Existing Contracts for Wholesale Power Purchase&#13;
(a)   Review the existing contracts and operational practices for wholesale&#13;
power purchase in the Shanghai power system. The issues that will be&#13;
investigated include:&#13;
*     economic goals of the different participants in the Shanghai&#13;
power system&#13;
*     existing methods of pricing capacity and energy, and&#13;
pricing of ancillary services&#13;
-     operating policies and system coordination procedures&#13;
*     methods of allocating responsibility for providing spinning&#13;
reserve between participants&#13;
*     procedures for dealing with emergency situations and loss&#13;
of generation units on the system&#13;
(b)   Provide a review  of international experience and practice in the&#13;
development and implementation of wholesale power purchase tariffs and&#13;
contracts.&#13;
(c)   At the conclusion of this phase the consultants will prepare a discussion&#13;
brief that will outline their principal findings. This brief will clearly&#13;
articulate the key considerations and criteria that will be used to develop a&#13;
efficient wholesale power contracting system.&#13;
Task 3:     Defining Commercial Arrangements for Market Operation and New&#13;
Wholesale Pricing Practices&#13;
(a)   By reference to international experience in countries adopting the&#13;
purchasing agency power sector structure the consultant will identify and&#13;
suggest an appropriate wholesale pricing methodology for the Shanghai&#13;
power system.&#13;
(b)   Develop models for the pricing of wholesale electricity. These models&#13;
will consider the impacts of financial and economic trade-offs in terms of&#13;
investment incentives, production efficiency, economic dispatch and&#13;
efficient utilization. The approach to improved wholesale pricing of&#13;

such as: stranded investments; existing contractual arrangements, etc.&#13;
Task 4:      Development of Model Power Purchase Contract&#13;
(a)   A draft commercial contract for the purchase of wholesale power by the&#13;
restructured SMEPC will be developed under this task. The contract will&#13;
address the following technical and financial aspects of wholesale power&#13;
transactions:&#13;
*  wholesale power metering arrangements&#13;
*  protocols for unit scheduling and dispatch&#13;
*  allocation of responsibilities for reserve margin and ancillary&#13;
services&#13;
*  financial adequacy criteria to be utilized&#13;
*  provisions for dispute resolution&#13;
*  grid connection standards&#13;
C. CONSULTANT QUALIFICATIONS&#13;

M   LRMC at the geneation level is about 38.9 fen/kWh in Shanghai. According to studies carried out for other regions of China, the investment cost in transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) is about 20-25 percent of the generation&#13;
cost. At present, only about 40-50 percent of T&amp;D investment is made by the power company. The rest is contributed by the municipality, IPPs and users. At this time, our best estimates of the LRMC at the consumer level&#13;
which is comparable to the revenue base of SMEPC is in the range of 42-44 fen/kWh in 1996 prices. For the purpose of establishing performance indicators, 44 fen/kWh is assumed. However, this will be subject to changes in&#13;
the structure of the power sector, which may lead to changes in the revenue base of SMEPC.&#13;

ANNEX 4.2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The owner of the Waigaoqiao Phase II project is the Shanghai Municipal&#13;
Electric Power Company (SMEPC). The domestic designer is the East China Electric&#13;
Power Design Institute (ECEPDI). The project, to be financed under a proposed World&#13;
Bank loan, consists of two 900 or 1000 MW coal-fired supercritical units which will be&#13;
installed in the Waigaoqiao Power Plant as its Phase II development. The Waigaoqiao&#13;
Phase I consists of four 300 MW units, three units in operation and one unit under&#13;
construction. The plant has a plan of Phase III (2x900 or 1000 MW) and the ultimate&#13;
capacity of the plant will be 4,800 or 5,200 MW. The plant is located in Zhuyuan&#13;
Village, Yancang County, Gaodong Town of the Pudong new area (the south bank of&#13;
the Yangtze River in Shanghai), 18 km from the center of Shanghai city. The site has&#13;
favorable topographical and geological conditions and is easily accessed by river and&#13;
roads. The Waigaoqiao New Harbor is directly west of the site and the Shanghai&#13;
sewage treatment plant is east of the site. South of the plant is Waigaoqiao Special&#13;
Economic Zone. The target date of commercial operation of the two units will be:&#13;
Unit 1:        May 01, 2003&#13;
Unit 2:        May 01, 2004&#13;
2.    The boilers and turbine generators for the project will have standardized ratings&#13;
of supercritical units based on well proven technology. The steam conditions are main&#13;
steam pressure of 24.2 MPa at the high pressure turbine inlet and superheat and reheat&#13;
steam temperatures of 538/566 degree C. For the Waigaoqiao Phase II project, 900-&#13;
1000 MW class supercritical units were selected by SMEPC and ECEPDI with the&#13;
assistance of a foreign consulting engineer based on technical and economical&#13;
justification.  Three alternatives comprising:  (a) five 600 MW  subcritical or&#13;
supercritical units; (b) four 900 MW subcritical or supercritical units; and (c) four 1,000&#13;
MW subcritical or supercritical units were investigated. A comprehensive study for&#13;
justification of selection of the type and unit size was carried out, which looked at&#13;
technical and economic aspects such as (a) demand and supply of the Shanghai grid; (b)&#13;
design parameters and configuration of major equipment; (c) economic justification of&#13;
supercritical units; (d) supply experience of potential vendors; (e) site limitation;&#13;
(f) environmental aspects; (g) availability and reliability of units; and (h) construction&#13;
schedule, etc. It was concluded that 900-1000 MW class supercritical units would be&#13;
the most economic candidate to be installed.&#13;
3.    While the technologies for large capacity supercritical units have been well&#13;
proven in some advanced countries, there are two different types in steam turbine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                      ANNEX 4.2&#13;
configurations, 900-1000 MW class tandem compound or cross compound. The final&#13;
selection of the unit capacity, 900 MW or 1000 MW, will be decided through the bid&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
4.    The units will be designed to operate with a hybrid constant pressure operation&#13;
mode for base load and variable pressure operation mode for a partial load to achieve&#13;
high efficiency and operational flexibility. The steam turbine will be equipped with by-&#13;
pass system with the capacity meeting the requirement of unit start-up and shut-down.&#13;
A condense demineralizing unit will be provided to meet the requirements of strict&#13;
steam/water quality in the supercritical plant.&#13;
Coal&#13;
5.    The units will consume up to about 4.8 million tons of coal a year, based on&#13;
annual operating hour of 5500. The coal for the proposed project will be sourced from&#13;
the Shenfu-Dongsheng coal mines, which are located in the border area of Shaanxi&#13;
province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The coal will be transported from&#13;
the mines by train to Huanghua port as the main route, or Qinhuangdao and/or Tianjing&#13;
ports as the back up route and then by sea and river transportation to the coal jetty near&#13;
the plant site. Letters of intent for coal supply and coal transportation were issued by&#13;
relevant authorities in October 1996. Security of coal supply and transportation is&#13;
considered satisfactory. The units were designed to bum bituminous coal with a&#13;
calorific value of 22,489-24,041 kj/kg, ash content of 12.0-16.77 percent and sulfur&#13;
content of 0.43-0.64 percent.&#13;
Boiler and Turbine-Generator&#13;
6.    The boilers will be of 900 or 1000 MW class coal-fired supercritical type with a&#13;
capacity of 2,905 tons/hr or 3,228 tons/hr. The minimum load without oil for flame&#13;
stabilization will be 35 percent of the maximum continuous rating (MCR). Boiler&#13;
efficiency (LHV base) will not be lower than 93 percent. One high chimney (height&#13;
240m) will be constructed for two boilers. Electrostatic precipitator with a removal&#13;
efficiency of 99.42 will be installed for each boiler. The boiler will also be equipped&#13;
with low NOx burners.&#13;
7.    The steam turbines will be of supercritical units of 900 MW tandem compound&#13;
type or 1000 MW cross compound type. The guaranteed heat rate of the turbine will&#13;
not be more than 7,645 kj/kWh.&#13;
FGD&#13;
8.   In order to at least offset the anticipated sulfur dioxide emissions from the Phase&#13;
II project (estimated at 44,000 to 45,000 tons/year), an FGD system will be installed at&#13;
Shidongkou Power Plant Units 1 and 2. The system will be capable of removing&#13;
approximately 48,000 to 49,000 tons of sulfur dioxide per year. The FGD system&#13;
selected is the basic wet limestone scrubber which employs forced oxidation to produce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                      ANNEX 4.2&#13;
a marketable gypsum byproduct. A very pure grade of limestone will be supplied from&#13;
mines in Jiangsu and/or Zhejiang provinces, approximately 200 km away. The system&#13;
will be designed for 90 percent removal of sulfur dioxide. Two FGD units are to be&#13;
installed, one for each boiler. The absorbers will be designed for moderate superficial&#13;
gas velocities, without the use of chemical reactivity enhancers. At present, SMEPC&#13;
will utilize gas-gas reheat for the flue gas exhaust system.&#13;
Coal Handling System&#13;
9.    Two units of 1,400 t/h ship unloaders will be installed at the coal unloading&#13;
jetty. The coal unloaded can be conveyed either to the storage yard or directly to the&#13;
boiler silos. Two stacker-reclaimers will be installed in the coal storage yard. The&#13;
storage capacity of the coal yard is equivalent to twenty five (25) days coal&#13;
consumption of the two boilers.&#13;
Ash Disposal System&#13;
10.   Positive-pressure pneumatic conveying system will be adopted for fly ash&#13;
disposal. The fly ash will be conveyed by the system to the ash silos at the river bank,&#13;
and then transported by trucks for comprehensive utilization (about 30 percent) or to the&#13;
ash yard by barges after being moistened. The selection of bottom ash disposal system&#13;
will be proposed by the bidders based on the submerged extractor and/or water-filled&#13;
bottom ash hopper according to their experience. The bottom ash after dewatering will&#13;
be transported by trucks for comprehensive utilization or to the ash yard by barges. The&#13;
two boilers will produce about 0.72 million tons of fly ash and 0.08 million tons of&#13;
bottom ash every year.&#13;
Instrumentation and Control System&#13;
11.   A microprocessor-based distributed control system including data acquisition&#13;
system (DAS), supervisory control system (SCS), control coordination system (CCS),&#13;
furnace safety supervision system (FSSS), etc., will be provided. On-line performance&#13;
monitoring system will be provided to improve plant performance, reduce coal&#13;
consumption, and gradually introduce innovative advanced maintenance techniques.&#13;
Cooling Water System&#13;
12.   Direct once through cooling mode of circulating water from Yangtze River will&#13;
be adopted. A circulating water pump house will be constructed at the river bank. Two&#13;
pumps will be installed for each turbine, arranged according to the unit system. Plant&#13;
makeup water will also be supplied from Yangtze River. Water treatment plant of&#13;
reverse osmosis (RO) type will be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                      ANNEX 4.2&#13;
Transmission Lines and Associated Substations&#13;
13.   The units will be connected to the Shanghai Municipal Power Grid (SMPG) by&#13;
500 kV double circuit transmission lines with a total length of 50 km, of which, 1 km&#13;
will be river crossing. There will be 4 outgoing lines from the plant switchyard, among&#13;
which 2 circuits to Yanghang Substation and the other 2 circuits to Yanggao Substation.&#13;
Yanggao is an existing substation and Yanghang will soon be constructed. In addition,&#13;
the 500 kV transmission component includes: (a) construction of one new substation at&#13;
Sanlin with 2 x 1,000 MVA, 500/220 kV transformers and associated SF6 circuit&#13;
breakers; and (b) extension of the existing Sijing Substation with lx 750 MVA,&#13;
500/220 kV transformer and associated SF6 circuit breakers. Reinforcement of the&#13;
existing 220 kV transmission system will be undertaken under a separate project.&#13;
14.   System stability study including load flow, fault level and transient stability&#13;
analyses were performed by ECEPDI for the SMPG at 500 kV level including the two&#13;
AC tie lines linking the SMPG to neighboring provinces within the East China Power&#13;
Grid (ECPG). It was concluded that with installation of two units of 900 or 1000 MW&#13;
and the proposed 500 kV transmission component, the system (both SMPG and ECPG)&#13;
remains stable under the worst system operating conditions.&#13;

ANNEX 4.5: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. SUMMARY OF KEY PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
Air Pollution&#13;
1.    Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics following completion of Phase I (4 x&#13;
300 MW), the proposed Phase II project (1,800-2,000 MW) and the total power program&#13;
at Waigaoqiao (Phases I, II, and III a total of 4,800-5,200 MW). As can be seen, the&#13;
Phase I project, not financed by the World Bank, meets Chinese emission standards for&#13;
dust and sulfur dioxide, whereas the proposed Phase II project is in compliance with both&#13;
Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines for emissions of dust, sulfur dioxide and&#13;
nitrogen oxides.&#13;
2.    Existing background levels of dust exceed both Chinese standards and World&#13;
Bank guidelines for ambient air quality. This is not unusual for China because of the&#13;
extensive reliance on coal for domestic use (cooking and heating). For Shanghai,&#13;
particularly in the Pudong area, officials from the Shanghai Bureau of Environmental&#13;
Protection (SMBEP) informed the appraisal mission that a combination of domestic coal&#13;
use, the massive construction activity, and the transport sector are the major sources of&#13;
dust, which they have targeted for control. To reduce ambient dust levels, SMEPC has&#13;
initiated a series of measures such as requiring buildings under construction and trucks&#13;
carrying building materials to be covered, testing conversion of public transport vehicles&#13;
to clean burning LPG, requiring lower emissions from new automobiles, encouraging&#13;
small industries to convert from coal to gas etc. These actions have begun to have&#13;
measurable effects in improving Shanghai air quality.&#13;
3.    Ambient sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides levels are within current World Bank&#13;
guidelines for ambient air quality but slightly exceed Chinese standards in certain&#13;
locations. With project implementation, levels of dust, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides&#13;
will increase and there will be some exceeding of the Chinese air quality standards for the&#13;
24 hour maximum levels of both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  However,&#13;
corresponding annual average values are all within the Chinese standards and all World&#13;
Bank ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides will be met. It&#13;
should be noted that the Chinese air quality standard for sulfur dioxide is extremely&#13;
restrictive, being about 2.5 times stricter than the United States standard (365&#13;
micrograms/Nm3-24 hour maximum) and more than 1.5 times stricter than the EU&#13;
standard (250 micrograms/Nm3-24 hour maximum), and the Chinese air quality standard&#13;
for nitrogen oxides is also extremely restrictive: the maximum 24 hour average is the&#13;
same as the US annual average (100 micrograms/Nm3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -                          ANNEX 4.5&#13;
4.     With project implementation (Phase II), ambient air quality will continue to meet&#13;
World Bank, US and EU standards with respect sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, but&#13;
slightly exceed Chinese standards. Dust levels will also increase slightly.' Considering&#13;
this unique situation concerning higher dust levels in the Pudong area, SMBEP provided&#13;
approvalfor the proposed project at the Waigaoqiao site (letter from SMBEP to SMEPC&#13;
dated December 20, 1996).&#13;
5.    When the entire power development program at Waigaoqiao is completed (Phases&#13;
1, II, and I1I), it is estimated (see Table 1-C) that ambient air quality for sulfur dioxide and&#13;
nitrogen oxides will still meet World Bank, US and EU standards, but still exceed&#13;
Chinese standards slightly more.&#13;
6.     SMBEP also indicated to the mission that their letter related to dust control&#13;
systems for Waigaoqiao Phase II was based upon a thorough analysis of local conditions.&#13;
The ESP must be designed with an efficiency greater than 99.2 percent (dust emissions&#13;
less than 100 mg/Nm3). SMEPC analyzed if further improvements to air quality could be&#13;
achieved with an increased level of dust control (dust emission levels less than 50&#13;
mg/Nm3). Results of this analysis are presented below.&#13;
-D------------I)ust Emission Levels (mg/Nm3)-&#13;
Ambient Air Quality (gig/Nm3)*     0.0             50.0           100.0&#13;

e Estimated at the point of maximum ground level impact from stack emissions (most conservative&#13;
assumption).&#13;
7.    As can be seen in this Table, the presence of the plant has a negligible impact on&#13;
air quality with respect to dust. Differences in emission levels from 50 to 100 mg/Nm&#13;
produce differences at the location where stack emissions exert their greatest influence on&#13;
ambient air quality that are below detectable limits, and well within error bounds of the&#13;
model. Therefore, SMEPC judged that the additional costs associated with increased&#13;
control ($8 to 11 million) were unjustified. Additionally, approximately 1,600 tons/year&#13;
of dust emissions will be eliminated at Shidongkou with the installation of the FGD unit.&#13;
So in effect, the "bubble concept" is providing offsets for both sulfur dioxide and dust.&#13;
8.    Table 1-C indicates expected reductions in ambient levels of sulfur dioxide&#13;
resulting from the FGD installation to be retrofitted at Shidongkou (SDK) in accordance&#13;
Shanghai Municipality will spend $1.0 billion a year fighting air pollution so that it can turn the city&#13;
into one of the cleanest in the world.&#13;

-101-                        ANNEX 4.5&#13;
with the "bubble concept" adopted for the project design, in comparison to the original&#13;
design concept of installing FGD  in the proposed Phase II project.  Clearly,&#13;
improvements in air quality for critically polluted Central Shanghai demonstrate the value&#13;
of the adopted bubble concept. Additionally, with the bubble concept, the emissions of&#13;
sulfur dioxide from Waigaoqiao will be more than compensated for by the reductions in&#13;
emissions at Shidongkou with a net annual reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions of about&#13;
3,000-5,000 tons when the two plants are considered together.&#13;
9.    Annual carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be 0.0127 billion tons for Phase&#13;
II, and 0.0334 billion tons for the overall program. This represents 0.059 and 0.156&#13;
percent of the annual industrial carbon dioxide burden. Therefore, both the project and&#13;
the overall program should present an insignificant impact on global warming. The&#13;
project will use the best commercial technology for coal-fired power generation. The&#13;
economic evaluation shows that even if the externalities of CO2 emissions are considered,&#13;
the economic benefits of tfie project still outweigh its costs (including environmental&#13;
aspect). Therefore, this level of CO2 emissions is considered acceptable.&#13;

Water Supply&#13;
10.   Water for the power plant (Phase II) will be supplied by the Yangtze River.&#13;
Approximately 74 m3/sec will be used for cooling purposes, another 0.3 m3/sec for&#13;
process water, and about 1,000 m3/day supplied from the municipal system will be used&#13;
for sanitary purposes.&#13;
11.   A once through cooling system will be used. Water will be withdrawn from the&#13;
lower depths of mid-river, then screened, filtered, chlorinated, and circulated through the&#13;
condenser system. The heated water discharge will be below the river surface, but at a&#13;
higher level and laterally displaced from the intake point.&#13;
12.   The average flow for the branch of the Yangtze from which cooling water will be&#13;
withdrawn is about 10,000 m3/sec. Therefore water withdrawal for the project will have&#13;
insignificant effect upon the rivers' overall hydrological regime.&#13;
13.   The complex hydrology and occasional tidal influences at this point in the&#13;
Yangtze River required both physical and mathematical models of the thermal plume be&#13;
performed to insure a cooling system design that minimizes hot water recirculation. The&#13;
EA consultant reviewed results of both modeling efforts and confirmed the conclusion&#13;
that the intake/outfall design is unlikely to lead to recirculation. Furthermore, the EA&#13;
concluded that the thermal discharge would cause minimal environmental impact to the&#13;
local aquatic ecology.&#13;
Water Pollution&#13;
14.   Wastewaters will be treated and either recycled or discharged to the Yangtze&#13;
River. Any wastewaters discharged to the Yangtze River will be treated to meet the&#13;
appropriate Chinese effluent standard or the World Bank guideline, whichever is stricter.&#13;
Treatment will be physical, chemical and/or biological. As mentioned above, a once&#13;
through cooling system will be used.&#13;
15.   Table 2 details all wastewater streams, their pollution characteristics, and any&#13;
treatment measures that are to be taken. Additionally, Chinese effluent standards are&#13;
provided. As can be seen, all effluents will be in compliance with all applicable&#13;
standards.&#13;

Coal Transport and Handling&#13;
16.   Fuel to the WGQ power plant will be low sulfur (0.43-0.64 percent), low ash&#13;
(12.0-16.77 percent) bituminous coal obtained from the Shenfu-Dongshen coal mine of&#13;
Inner Mongolia. Coal will be transported by rail to the port of Qinhuangdao&#13;
(approximately 1000 km). From the port, the coal is shipped in 35,000 ton shallow draft&#13;
coal ships down the Yellow Sea to the Fast China Sea and then up the Yangtze River&#13;
channel to the plant site, a total distance of about 800 km.&#13;
17.   The coal will be unloaded and conveyed to the storage yard. Sprinkling facilities&#13;
utilizing wash water recycled from the coal conveyor system will be installed for dust&#13;
suppression. Trees will be planted around the coal yard to reduce wind velocity and&#13;
thereby limit the possibilities for coal dust resuspension. Transfer points, outlets of the&#13;
coal crusher, and the coal bin will be enclosed and fitted with baghouse filters to trap&#13;
potential dust emissions.&#13;
Ash Management&#13;
18.  Initially, bottom ash from both Phase I and Phase II plants will be crushed with a&#13;
slag crusher and removed by a water ejector to the slag pond from which the slag is&#13;
pumped to a dewatering bin and then to a slag yard. The slag yard is located at the power&#13;
plant site in a specially created embankment on the bank of the Yangtze River. The slag&#13;
yard when complete will be used as the Phase III coal storage area.&#13;
19.   Ultimately, all fly ash and bottom ash are to be sold. Fly ash will be transported&#13;
pneumatically from the ESPs' to storage silos. If the ash is to be used for construction&#13;
material, it will be loaded onto air tight trucks and transported to the consumer. If the ash&#13;
is to be disposed, it will be mixed with water (15 - 20 per cent) and transported by&#13;
conveyor to the ash disposal jetty. From the jetty, ash will be barged down the Yangtze&#13;
River to the Limin Ash Yard (a distance of about 14 km). About one barge (3000 ton&#13;
capacity) per day would be required to accommodate all ash production from Phase lI&#13;
(about 2400 tons). From the barge, ash will be unloaded with a bucket crane and&#13;
deposited into the ash yard. The yard will be filled in sections to minimize dust&#13;
formation. After a section is completed it will be covered with topsoil and planted with a&#13;
vegetative cover.&#13;
20.   The ash yard is located along a remote, barren, and sparsely inhabited littoral area&#13;
of the Yangtze River shoreline. It is a specially prepared embankment with a concrete&#13;
outer berm separating it from the river. Concrete tiles sealed together at the point of&#13;
juncture form a continuous impervious lining to the walls of the ash yard. Under normal&#13;
conditions water will be contained in the ash yard even under conditions of light rain.&#13;
water will only leave the ash yard by evaporation (the area experiences a net annual&#13;
evaporation rate of 408 mm). If the ash surface becomes dry, it will be compacted with a&#13;
roller and moveable spray facilities will suppress dust formation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                       ANNEX 4.5&#13;
21.   The subsurface of the ash yard is clay and the bottom of the ash yard is only 0.5 m&#13;
from the groundwater table. However, the fly ash contains about 23 per cent calcium&#13;
which makes it highly alkaline and, therefore, should exhibit excellent retention&#13;
properties for heavy metals. It is highly unlikely that trace metals will be leached in any&#13;
significant quantity. Furthermore, the high calcium content of the ash causes it to solidify&#13;
when moistened. Therefore, both the clay layer and the solidified ash should form an&#13;
impervious barrier for any groundwater contamination. Nonetheless, a groundwater&#13;
monitoring program will be maintained in the vicinity of the ash yard to insure no&#13;
contamination occurs.&#13;
22.   A forest belt will be planted around the ash yard to act as a wind break and further&#13;
suppress dust resuspension. When the ash yard is complete, it will be covered with&#13;
topsoil and used for agriculture.&#13;
Transmission Line&#13;
23.   Two 500 kV double circuit lines will export power to Shanghai. One line to the&#13;
Yanghang substation is approximately 23 km long, and the other line to the Yanggao&#13;
substation is approximately 27 km long. Both lines will follow either the existing right-&#13;
of-way of a highway route currently under construction or along the right-of-way of an&#13;
existing 220 kV line. There will be no resettlement involved. All resettlement activities&#13;
have already been conducted by the Shanghai Transport Department in conjunction with&#13;
the highway construction. Small parcels of agricultural land will be used for the&#13;
transmission tower footings. Farmers who own this land will be compensated for any&#13;
losses in agricultural production. Tower design will be in accordance with Chinese&#13;
standards for electric field strength (4 kilovolts/meter, ref. GB 15707-96: Standard&#13;
Allowable Values of Radiation Disturbance from Overhead High Voltage Transmission&#13;
Lines).&#13;
24.   Proper practices will be used during transmission line construction, so minimal&#13;
impacts are anticipated. During operation the primary concerns would be noise (from&#13;
corona discharge) and electromagnetic interference to TV reception or telephone&#13;
communications. These issues were estimated to be negligible.&#13;
Noise&#13;
25.   The power station is located in the rapidly developing Pudong district on the&#13;
outskirts of central Shanghai. Currently, the Phase I Project adjacent to the plant site is&#13;
the only significant land use activity in the immediate area. General land use in the area&#13;
is residential, commercial, and light industry.&#13;
26.   Equipment for the Phase I project has all been designed to meet Chinese noise&#13;
standards for both worker and public protection. Similarly, all equipment to be supplied&#13;
in the Phase II Project will be required to meet Chinese noise standards and will be so&#13;
specified in the bidding documents. Outside the plant boundary, the Phase I and Phase II&#13;
Projects complies with World Bank standards but slightly exceeds the Shanghai&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                         ANNEX 4.5&#13;
Municipality night-time standard in certain areas. However, the areas in which the&#13;
standard is exceeded is industrial, and there is no one present in the evening to be affected&#13;
by the noise. With the Phase III Project, the situation is slightly more elevated. Again,&#13;
however, the exceedance occurs in areas at least 1 km from the closest residence.&#13;
27.   Based upon the analysis, it was predicted that no significant impact to public&#13;
health and welfare from noise should occur, from all three project phases.&#13;
Aquatic/Terrestrial Ecology&#13;
28.   As mentioned above, the project site is in a rapidly developing industrial/&#13;
commercial area. Previously, this area was used for agriculture (vegetables, rice, cotton)&#13;
but is now planned for industrial development. There are no rare or endangered species&#13;
either on land or in river.&#13;
29.   Previous investigations have indicated 44 types of aquatic plants, 19 types of&#13;
aquatic animals and 17 types of benthos in the Yangtze River near the cooling water and&#13;
wastewater discharges. Most fish are commercial species such as anchovy, carp and&#13;
shrimp. However, the annual aggregate commercial catch has been declining, reflecting&#13;
increased water pollution primarily from increased Shanghai municipal sewage loads,&#13;
previous practices of overfishing and use of small nets, or newly imposed fishing&#13;
restrictions, or some combination of all these factors.&#13;
30.   It is anticipated that within the thermal plume, the species composition of zoo-&#13;
and phytoplankton will change, and there may be some losses in zooplankton population.&#13;
However, none of the species are unique, and the colonies can easily be reestablished in&#13;
adjacent areas. For fish, there should be no impact since they are completely mobile. At&#13;
the point of discharge, it is estimated that about 500 meters of river width would be&#13;
affected. Since the river width is 6,500 meters at this point, there is ample area for fish&#13;
passage.&#13;
31.   The project should cause minimal impact on the aquatic environment.&#13;
Occupational Health and Safety&#13;
32.   Appropriate considerations will be incorporated into the design and operation of&#13;
the plant and associated offsites to insure worker health and safety.   Special&#13;
considerations will be incorporated into the design to assure safe conditions in the&#13;
management of hazardous materials (fuel oil, chlorine, hydrogen, caustic etc.).&#13;
International standards of worker safety will be included in all bid documents of project&#13;
equipment. Boilers and other potentially dangerous equipment will be designed to meet&#13;
ASME standards of safety and will be so specified in the bidding documents.&#13;
Polychlorinated biphenyl's (PCBs) are illegal in China; their use is prohibited from the&#13;
project. Prohibition of asbestos will also be specified in the bid documents.&#13;

Historical/Cultural/Archaeological Sites&#13;
33.   The site of the Waigaoqiao power plant is on a wedge of land in the Pudong New&#13;
Area that is experiencing significant agricultural, residential, industrial and commercial&#13;
development. According to the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Remains Authority (letter&#13;
dated March 19, 1997), there are no resources of archaeological or cultural significance at&#13;
the site. Nonetheless, appropriate measures associated with accidental finds during&#13;
construction will be included in the project.&#13;
Human Environment&#13;
34.   On December 9, 1996 a public meeting was held in the Multifunction Hall at the&#13;
Waigaoqiao Power Plant. General conclusions of the participants were:&#13;
*  The existing power station Phase I is well managed. Phase II will use more&#13;
advanced technology, and is expected to be even better environmentally.&#13;
-  Future growth of foreign investment in the Shanghai area is dependent upon&#13;
increased capacity for electricity production.&#13;
-  Future growth of foreign investment is necessary for economic growth of&#13;
Shanghai and the improved well-being of its citizens.&#13;

ANNEX 4.6: SUMMARY OF DESCRIPTION OF "STUDY TO&#13;
ACHIEVE MAXIMUM REDUCTION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE&#13;
EMISSIONS AT MINIMUM COST IN SHANGHAI&#13;
MUNICIPALITY"&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The proposed World Bank project consists of a thermal power plant (two 900-&#13;
1000 MW boilers) to be constructed in the rapidly developing Pudong District of&#13;
Shanghai Municipality.  The power plant will utilize a very low  sulfur coal&#13;
(approximately 0.4-0.6 percent), which will result in minimal emissions of sulfur dioxide,&#13;
well within Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines. However, a regulation&#13;
recently enacted by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection&#13;
(SMBEP) requires all new thermal power projects to install desulfurization technology.&#13;
2.    The World Bank project team reached agreement with Shanghai Municipal&#13;
officials to apply this regulation in a flexible manner by allowing use of the "bubble&#13;
concept."   With the "bubble concept," sulfur dioxide emissions released from&#13;
Waigaoqiao would be offset by controlling sulfur dioxide emissions from selected&#13;
thermal power plants currently operating in Shanghai Municipality. Thus, if one were to&#13;
place a "bubble" over Shanghai Municipality, no net increase of sulfur dioxide emissions&#13;
would be observable inside the bubble after Waigaoqiao started operations. Emissions&#13;
from existing power plants would be controlled by flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units.&#13;
3.    Utilization of the "bubble concept" has several distinct advantages. First, it is&#13;
possible to achieve the required sulfur dioxide reduction at a lower cost than installing&#13;
the FGD at Waigaoqiao. Second, it is possible to achieve greater improvements in air&#13;
quality to critically impacted areas of Shanghai Municipality by installing the FGD at&#13;
one or more power plants contributing more to local air pollution than would be&#13;
contributed by Waigaoqiao. Third, since FGD facilities produce extremely low dust&#13;
emissions, it is highly likely that retrofitting FGD on an existing power station would&#13;
substantially lower dust emissions in addition to those of sulfur dioxide.&#13;
Study Scope&#13;
4.    With this background, SMEPC formulated a study with the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   Identify existing power plants in the SMEPC system  suitable for&#13;
retrofitting with FGD technology and rank them on a priority basis.&#13;
(b)   Identify suitable FGD technology(ies) for these power stations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119 -                       ANNEX 4.6&#13;
(c)   Recommend a program of retrofitting priority power plant(s) satisfying the&#13;
"bubble requirement" of no net increase in sulfur dioxide emissions.&#13;
5.    SMEPC own seven of the twelve power plants in Shanghai Municipality. The&#13;
study was confined to SMEPC plants. Among these plants, factors considered in&#13;
establishing priorities for FGD retrofit included:&#13;
(a)   magnitude of sulfur dioxide emissions;&#13;
(b)   magnitude of existing environmental impacts (public health, agriculture,&#13;
etc.);&#13;
(c)   space availability for FGD installation/sorbent disposal; and&#13;
(d)   sufficient remaining operating life for the power station.&#13;
Results&#13;
6.    SMEPC established that retrofitting two of the four boilers at the Shidongkou&#13;
Thermal Power Plant (total 600 MW) with a wet limestone FGD unit would provide the&#13;
appropriate reductions to satisfy the "bubble concept." It was estimated that such an&#13;
installation would remove between 48,000 to 49,000 tons of sulfur dioxide annually,&#13;
which would offset the predicted annual emissions of Waigaoqiao of 44,000 to 45,000&#13;
tons. There would be a net reduction of 5, 000 tons per year using the bubble concept.&#13;
7.    Additionally, sulfur dioxide emissions from Shidongkou have a greater influence&#13;
on air quality in the central areas of Shanghai Municipality than the emissions anticipated&#13;
from Waigaoqiao. Therefore, greater improvements in air quality to more critical areas&#13;
of Shanghai would be achieved with the bubble concept.&#13;
8.    An international consultant was then engaged to verify SMEPC's findings,&#13;
establish the most appropriate FGD technology choice, and develop cost estimates for the&#13;
retrofit program at Shidongkou.&#13;
9.    The international consultant fulfilled these objectives and confirmed SMEPC's&#13;
findings and technology choice. Based upon his cost estimates, the bubble concept with&#13;
the FGD retrofit at Shidongkou should save approximately US$100 million over costs of&#13;
FGD installation at Waigaoqiao.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 4.7: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
General&#13;
1.    While planning for the land acquisition of the Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant&#13;
Phase lI priority was given to minimize the scope of resettlement. Where land acquisition&#13;
and demolition of existing housing are unavoidable, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
provides for replacement of housing, alternative employment opportunities,&#13;
infrastructure, services and associated rehabilitation. The RAP aims at improving the&#13;
standards of living of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) or at least restoring it to the&#13;
pre-project levels. This annex is prepared based on the RAP submitted by Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC).&#13;
2.    According to the Master Plan of the Municipality of Shanghai, all of the&#13;
associated 500 kV Transmission Component (50 km. in length) will be located on the&#13;
Greenbelt which is going to be constructed in conjunction with a ring road around&#13;
Shanghai. There will be no other land acquisition or resettlement attributable to the&#13;
transmission line construction. Land required for transmission line towers will amount to&#13;
13,000 square meters out of the 450 hectares of the entire greenbelt.&#13;
3.    The 500 kV transmission lines will be connected to the Yanggao and the&#13;
Yanghang substations. Yanggao is an existing substation already in operation and does&#13;
not require new land acquisition.  The construction of Yanghang substation will&#13;
commence in 1997 affecting 24 households and acquiring 142 mu of land (including 128&#13;
mu of arable land and 3,859 square meters of housing). 140 PAPs will either be re-&#13;
employed in enterprises or retired. The construction will not affect any enterprises or&#13;
public buildings. The resettlement of the PAPs at the Yanghang Substation site will be&#13;
undertaken according to the policy in the RAP for the Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant.&#13;
An implementation plan (including the impact, budget, schedule, exact description of&#13;
entitlements and organizational responsibility for implementation) of these PAPs will be&#13;
prepared as soon as the Shanghai Municipal Government authorizes the commencement&#13;
of land acquisition and a formal census of the PAPs and their assets can be undertaken.&#13;
The implementation plan will be submitted to the Bank for review.&#13;
4.    Any unforeseen future resettlement associated with the project will be carried out&#13;
according to the policy and procedures established in the RAP.&#13;
Scope of Resettlement&#13;
5.    According to the RAP, the project will acquire a total of 1,555 mu of land,&#13;
demolish 40,639 square meters of floor space, relocate 274 households and affect 1,933&#13;
persons (Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-121-                        ANNEX 4.7&#13;
A. WAIGAOQIAO THERMAL POWER PLANT II&#13;
6.    The proposed Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant Phase II, with two 1,000 or 900&#13;
MW coal-fire super-critical units, is located to the south of Waigaoqiao Phase I, in the&#13;
Pudong New District of Shanghai City. Total land acquisition will be 1,555 mu,&#13;
including 734 mu arable land, 821 mu noncultivated land. 274 households (869 persons)&#13;
and 17 small Township/Village Enterprises (TVE) will be relocated. And a total of&#13;
51,389 square meters of floor space will be demolished. Including those who will be&#13;
affected the loss of agricultural land and enterprise relocation, a total of 1,933 people will&#13;
be influenced by the construction of Waigaoqiao Power Plant. 596 farmers will need&#13;
non-farm job allocation and 221 persons will be provided old age pension.&#13;
7.    The proposed power plant will continue use the existing ash disposal site about 14&#13;
kilometers downstream of Yangtze River, built along with Waigaoqiao Thermal Power&#13;
Plant Phase I. Due to the high demand for ash utilization, and the relatively large&#13;
capacity of the first phase ash site (still under construction), there is no plan to build&#13;
another ash disposal site in the near future.&#13;
B. 500 KV TRANSMISSION LINES&#13;
8.    The project will also finance two sections of 500 kV transmission lines (total&#13;
length of 50 kilometers) and equipment of two 500 kV substations (including a new&#13;
substation) in Pudong area. In order to connect the two units to the power grid in&#13;
Shanghai, there will be four circuits of outgoing lines, among which, two circuits to&#13;
Yanghang Substation, the other two circuits to Yanggao Substation. Transmission line&#13;
routing will remain inside the Greenbelt. There will be no other resettlement for the 500&#13;
kV transmission lines.&#13;
Purpose and Strategy of Resettlement&#13;
9.    The main objective of resettlement planning was to minimize the scope of&#13;
resettlement and whenever resettlement could not be avoided to ensure that the living&#13;
standards of the PAPs will be improved or at least restored to the pre-project levels. The&#13;
PAPs to be relocated will be given a choice among several housing options including:&#13;
(a) replacement housing of equal size and quality; and b) newly built apartment housing&#13;
near Gaodong Town Center, with better facilities at no additional cost. The losses of the&#13;
PAPs will be compensated at replacement cost. During the first phase of Waigaoqiao&#13;
Thermal Power Plant, over 1,000 PAPs were relocated to similar new apartment&#13;
buildings, and were satisfied with their new accommodations. The relocated enterprises,&#13;
will be allocated new land and compensated at replacement cost to rebuild their&#13;
workshops. In these cases a negotiated settlement will be reached between two parties&#13;
before any land acquisition could take place. No depreciation will be applied to&#13;
compensation payments due to the age or condition of the affected assets.&#13;
10.   PAPs losing agricultural land will be given non-farm employment within the local&#13;
area. Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant, SMEPC and Gaodong Town Government will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122-                        ANNEX4.7&#13;
coordinate their efforts to create stable nonfarm employment opportunities for the&#13;
affected laborers. Elderly population, will be allocated a standard pension to ensure that&#13;
their livelihood will be improved or at least maintained. While the old age pension is an&#13;
entitlement which is not regularly available to the population with rural registration, the&#13;
project will make the necessary deposits to the labor bureau to entitle the older rural&#13;
workers to the same benefits that the enterprise workers enjoy.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
11.   Forming the legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement of the Waigaoqiao&#13;
Thermal Power Project are both laws or regulations from the state, and implementation&#13;
measures from Shanghai Municipality. The state laws or regulations include: "Land&#13;
Administration Law" (1986), "City Planning Act" (1990), and "Administrative&#13;
Regulation of Urban Building Demolition and Relocation" (1991).  The local&#13;
implementation measures include: "Shanghai Administration Measure of Using Land for&#13;
State Construction" (1992), and Shanghai Implementation Details of Administrative&#13;
Regulation of Urban Building Demolition and Relocation" (1993).&#13;
12.   Under this project, most of the acquired land is rural land. The other type of land&#13;
acquisition is the acquisition of urban land for resettlement sites.&#13;
13.   The compensation earmarked for resettlement will be used to generate&#13;
employment for displaced labors and/or to provide pension for the elderly. The county&#13;
government through its land administration bureau will be responsible for creating&#13;
nonfarm jobs for the affected farmers, or assisting local township and village owned&#13;
enterprises to hire displaced village labors.&#13;
Compensation Determination and Payment&#13;
14.   Land compensation includes payment for young crops, compensation for land,&#13;
and a range of related fees and taxes.&#13;
15.   Land compensation is set in the vicinity of Y 50,000 per mu, with the following&#13;
breakdown:&#13;
(a)   compensation for young crops, based on annual yield: 450-720 yuan per&#13;
mu&#13;
(b)   compensation for land: Y 12,000 per mu&#13;
(c)   rice and edible oil price differential: Y 1,800 per mu&#13;
(d)   land reclamation fund: Y 10,000-18,000 per mu&#13;
(e)   land occupation tax: Y 6,667 per mu&#13;
(f)   compensation for on/underground facilities: Y 14,948 per mu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123 -                         ANNEX 4.7&#13;
16.   The compensation for land will be given to affected villages, which could be used&#13;
to develop village economy, community facilities, or distribute directly to all members&#13;
within the villages. (All cultivated land within the affected villages will be redistributed&#13;
after land acquisition).&#13;

Resettlement Institutional Responsibility&#13;
18.   A project resettlement office has been set up within the Shanghai Municipal&#13;
Electric Power Company (SMEPC) to oversee the management and implementation of&#13;
resettlement program. It will be assisted by Gaodong Town Government Resettlement&#13;
Office. SMEPC, as the project owner, is responsible for paying compensation as required&#13;
under the Land Administration Law and other state and municipal regulations. Within&#13;
the Shanghai Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Plant, a land requisition and resettlement office&#13;
will be set up with 3-5 full time staff to carry out day-to-day work related to resettlement.&#13;
They will work closely with resettlement officials from Gaodong Town government&#13;
during the resettlement implementation. They are responsible for: (a) obtaining various&#13;
project approval permits, such as planning permit, land use certificate, and land&#13;
acquisition or demolition permits; (b) formulating and implementing resettlement action&#13;
plan for the project; (c) estimating total resettlement cost; (d) distributing resettlement&#13;
funds to affected villages, enterprises and individuals; and (e) implementing resettlement&#13;
monitoring and evaluation for the whole project.&#13;

19.   If an affected person is not satisfied with the compensation package or if, for any&#13;
reason, the compensation does not materialize according to the agreed schedule, he or she&#13;
could go through a grievance procedure specified in the resettlement action plan. PAPs'&#13;
grievance can be first brought to the attention of the Village Resettlement Office. If the&#13;
decision is not satisfactory to the PAPs it can be appealed in stages to the following&#13;
authorities according to a specified procedure. The appeal levels are: Land Acquisition&#13;
Business Administration (LABAS) of the county; LABAS of Pudong; House and Land&#13;
Administration of Shanghai; Project Resettlement Team; and finally the Peoples Court.&#13;

ANNEX 6.1: LEAST COST STUDY AND SHANGHAI POWER&#13;
GENERATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
1.    A least cost study was carried out by BERI, in conjunction with SMEPC, using&#13;
the WASP (Wien Automatic System Planning) optimization model. The study was&#13;
complemented by an analysis of environmental impacts attributable to the optimal&#13;
expansion program. A detailed report prepared by BERI and SMEPC is in the project&#13;
file.&#13;
Shadow Pricing&#13;
2.    The least cost study and all economic analyses were based on shadow prices. For&#13;
the least cost analysis, the official foreign exchange rate (Y 8.31$1.0) at the time of&#13;
appraisal was used. It is considered to reflect market conditions. Cost of imported goods&#13;
and services were priced at their estimated financial costs (e.g., a conversion factor of 1.0&#13;
was used). Domestic costs, most notably domestically produced power generating&#13;
equipment and coal, were shadow priced using specific conversion factors. The shadow&#13;
price for coal was established at Y 325.5/ton in Shanghai (respectively Y 177/ton) of coal&#13;
equivalent or Y 255.8/ton (respectively Y 139/ton) of 5,500-kcal/kg raw coal. The&#13;
economic price of gas was established at $3.6/MBtu of LNG (CIF Shanghai equivalent to&#13;
CIF Japan) and a regasification cost of $0.8/MBtu.&#13;
Least Cost Analysis&#13;
3.    The technical and economic characteristics of the candidates considered in&#13;
Shanghai's power generation development study are presented in Table 1. It must be&#13;
noted that two optimizations were carried out: (a) the first using investment costs that do&#13;
not include FGD costs for all coal-fired power plants; and (b) the second for coal-fired&#13;
candidates within the Shanghai Municipal area, investment costs that include the cost of&#13;
installation of FGD at Shidongkou. This approach assumes that the "bubble concept"&#13;
could be applied to all coal-fired candidates in the Shanghai area to meet the&#13;
Municipality's new environmental regulations. A 12 percent discount rate was used.&#13;
4.    The optimizations were based on the following reliability (LOLP) criteria: no&#13;
constraints up to year 2000 because of current power shortages, 2 percent in 2001 and&#13;
2002, 1 percent during 2003-2005, and 0.5 percent after 2005.&#13;
5.    The optimum solutions (mostly identical) of the two optimizations are presented&#13;
in Tables 2 and 3. The optimum solution in the without Waigaoqiao case is presented in&#13;
Table 4. The development program of Shanghai's power generation system is presented&#13;
in Table 5.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project is
            intended to: 1) increase electricity supply to reduce the
            acute power shortages in Shanghai through development of two
            very large coal-fired super-critical thermal units; 2)
            develop a program to apply for the first time in China the
            "bubble concept" for cost effective air quality
            management within Shanghai Municipality; 3) support the
            ongoing power sector reform by restructuring Shanghai
            Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) in line with the
            power sector reform strategy; increasing private sector
            involvement through listing of the generation company; and
            adjusting the tariff level to accommodate the stricter
            sulfur dioxide emission standards; and 4) promote an
            innovative and diversified financing model for large
            infrastructure projects and improve the access of power
            entities to international financial markets.  The project
            will include the following components: (i) investment; (ii)
            environmental protection; (iii) power sector reform; and
            (iv) institutional development.
