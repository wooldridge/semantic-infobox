A. BriefCountryUpdate&#13;
&#13;
1.      Afghanistan is now at a critical point in its history, where significant gains made&#13;
in the past year and a half need to be consolidated, and the tangible benefits of&#13;
development felt more widely by the Afghan people. Despite significant steps forward,&#13;
the situation remains fragile with continued serious security problems encountered almost&#13;
daily. Government security forces remain inadequate to widen state control and rein in&#13;
disaffected groups around the country. Greater andmore rapid progress inreconstruction&#13;
will require continued, high-level attention and assistance from the international&#13;
community. Afghanistan's partners also need to squarely face the need to assist in&#13;
bringingabout greater stability andsecurity.&#13;
&#13;
2.      On the economic front, much has been achieved in the past year and a half. A&#13;
successful currency reform has resulted in a single, stable currency. Fiscal policy has&#13;
remained conservative with a no overdraft policy. An ordinary (recurrent) budget was&#13;
passed for SY1381 (March 21, 2002-March         20, 2003), and the authorities adhered to&#13;
the no overdraft policy during implementation. A national development framework,&#13;
which identified development priorities and policy directions, was formulated. And, for&#13;
SY1382, significant gains have been made to solidify the budget as the primary policy&#13;
tool with boththe ordinary and development budgets inplace byMarch2003.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Priority has been placed on enhancing the capacity within government to manage&#13;
its reconstruction and development program. These efforts include refocusing the role o f&#13;
government on coordination, policy setting and regulation (rather than implementation),&#13;
relying on international contractors when necessary to enhance capacity on an emergency&#13;
basis in key fiduciary areas, and using NGOs and the private sector to implement&#13;
development and reconstruction activities whenever appropriate and feasible.            The&#13;
authorities have also established a mechanism to finance feasibility studies for projects&#13;
within the development budget that are not yet sufficiently prepared to implement. All o f&#13;
these efforts should result in an expansion o f absorptive capacity, consistent with the&#13;
experience in other post-conflict countries which has shown that the capacity to absorb&#13;
development assistance increases dramatically after about three years.&#13;
&#13;
4.      In addition to continuing and solidifying capacity building efforts already&#13;
underway, concentrated focus is now being placed on enhancing own revenue through&#13;
sequenced customs reforms and on escalating efforts to resolve on-going payments&#13;
problems associated with the lack o f adequate banking capacity.&#13;
&#13;
5.      In summary, the Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan (TISA) has a unique&#13;
opportunity to lay the ground work for a brighter future, by harnessing the support o f the&#13;
population which is looking for security, honest administration, and a realistic hope for a&#13;
better future for their children. By garnering public support for sound institutions, and&#13;
equitable and transparent governance, TISA has both the opportunity and the&#13;
responsibility to move forward on public administration reforms.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. FirstEmergencyPublicAdministrationProject&#13;
&#13;
6.      InApril 2002, IDA approved its first post-conflict grant to Afghanistan for a $10&#13;
million Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP). EPAP's objective was to put&#13;
inplace, on an emergency basis, capacity inkey public administration areas to facilitate&#13;
better use o f public resources, including donor funds, for urgent reconstruction and&#13;
development efforts. Specifically, the grant finances international firms to work with&#13;
government officials to carry out procurement, financial management, and audit&#13;
functions.   The project focused on a very narrow set o f priority issues, building on&#13;
lessons from other post-conflict countries where procurement and fiduciary weaknesses&#13;
delayed reconstruction programs and put injeopardy the continued high-level o f donor&#13;
support that was needed. The three main contractors under this project were mobilized&#13;
during the summer/autumn o f 2002 under contracts that are about two years induration.&#13;
As of April 17, $3.4 out o f $10.0 million has disbursed-ahead   o f original disbursement&#13;
projections-and   the remainingbalances are largelycommitted. Overall, implementation&#13;
has been generally satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
7.      FinancialManagement. Ina staged approach, good progress has been made in&#13;
developing the foundations for a financial management system within the Ministry o f&#13;
Finance (MOF) treasury.       In the first stage, with the assistance of the Financial&#13;
Management Agent, a system for computerized check issuance went on-line in Kabul in&#13;
October 2002. This enabled real-time reporting on all expenditures that are processed in&#13;
Kabul. By the start o f SY1382, this accounting system has been augmented to allow for&#13;
control o fbudget execution against budget allotments-again    for all expenditures that are&#13;
processed in Kabul. Recording o f revenues is now also possible. Work i s progressing&#13;
towards the integration o f a standard payroll module which will be piloted in about two&#13;
ministries.    Connectivity testing has started with an aim to introduce the accounting&#13;
system in one remote location. A Grant Management Unit has been established in the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance that should assist the government in tracking donor financing and&#13;
provide donors with adequate financial management reports.         Training and capacity&#13;
buildingefforts are well underway to enhance the likely sustainability o f achievements to&#13;
date. MOF staff currently handle all data entry and check runs, and M O F staff and local&#13;
consultants are being trained to handle trouble-shooting and higher-end functions.&#13;
Within the next six months, the authorities will needto develop a clear strategy on how to&#13;
put inplace support that may be needed when the existing emergency support comes to&#13;
conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
8.      While outside o f the scope o f EPAP, there remains deficiencies in the overall&#13;
expenditure system including cash management and the payments system.               Timely&#13;
budget execution remains a problem, especially in the provinces. A "nominal&#13;
headcount was completed for the sixth month o f SY1381 on the basis o f salary claims&#13;
submitted by ministries and departments, but there remain serious challenges in&#13;
maintaining an up to date list o f civil servants-a  necessary first step towards overall&#13;
control o fthe payroll. And, efforts at enhanced expenditure tracking will be needed.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Procurement.      The Procurement Agent works to support the Afghanistan&#13;
Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA) procurement unit. The original concept was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to create a focal point for building procurement capacity while ensuring that emergency&#13;
short-term support was in place.          The Procurement Agent was expected to assist in&#13;
"complex"       procurement-drawing on the input from line ministries for technical&#13;
specifications.      For "simple" procurement activities, the Procurement Agent would&#13;
provide support, guidance and oversight to the line ministries carrying out these&#13;
activities. The definition o f "simple" and "complex" was expected to shift over time as&#13;
line ministry capacity increased. However, implementation in the early stage o f the&#13;
contract was hindered because o f initial cuts by the authorities to the scope o f the&#13;
assignment during contract negotiations. The capacity building component was largely&#13;
eliminated, and initial activities focused almost exclusively on carrying out procurement&#13;
h c t i o n s directly. Earlier this year, a contract amendment restored the capacity building&#13;
element, though identification o f appropriate counterparts especially in line ministries&#13;
remains problematic. A legislative review has beeninitiated, a training program i s being&#13;
developed, and plans are being discussed to more widely disseminate information to the&#13;
local business community on procurement practices and what they need to do to&#13;
effectively bid for contracts.&#13;
&#13;
10.        By end-April, 2003, a procurement agent has assisted in the placement o f 80&#13;
contracts valued at just under $50 million. Contracts valued at an additional $160 million&#13;
are inhand. While these figures remain relatively small, this reflects the fact that, to date,&#13;
not very much donor assistance for reconstruction and development activities has flowed&#13;
through the development budget, but rather has been implemented directly through UN&#13;
organizations, NGOs, or bilateral donors. However, even with the relatively low volume&#13;
and with only nine-months of the two year contract concluded, the entire cost o f the&#13;
Procurement Agent represents only 2.5 percent o f the value o f contacts already placed&#13;
and inhand. By contract end, this figure is likely to fall around one percent.&#13;
&#13;
11.       Key implementationconstraints relate to recruitment o f core counterpart staff and&#13;
identification o f counterparts in line ministries; awareness o f the role o f the procurement&#13;
agent within line ministries; and logistics.           During EPAP supervision, efforts are&#13;
underway to assist the authorities to more clearly delineate roles and responsibilities o f&#13;
the A A C A procurement unit, line ministries, and other partners. On several occasions,&#13;
the authorities have not been receptive to the services o f the Procurement Agent being&#13;
utilized for projects other than those h d e d by IDA and ARTF, although this was&#13;
envisioned inthe project design. To date, this has been satisfactorily resolved on a case-&#13;
by-case basis when it emerged. However, a holistic procurement review which is now&#13;
on-going should help identify why this occurs and put in place corrective measures to&#13;
address the underlying concerns. Within the next six months, the authorities will need to&#13;
develop a clear strategy on how to put in place support that may be needed when the&#13;
existing emergency support comes to conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
12.       Audit. The independence o f the Auditor General has been confirmed by&#13;
Presidential decree. A steering group within the Auditor General's Office has been&#13;
established to guide project implementation.           In addition to computer and language&#13;
training, technical courses have also started in which over 100 staff have participated.&#13;
Pilot audits have been identified and include donor supported projects (IDA projects and&#13;
an EU project) and a govemment ministry (Ministry o f Foreign Affairs), a state-owned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
enterprise (Ariana) and a system (computerizationo f treasury functions at the Ministry o f&#13;
Finance). There i s still a need to more fully assess the overall audit framework. Within&#13;
the next six months, the authorities will need to develop a clear strategy on how to put in&#13;
place support that may be needed when the existing emergency support comes to&#13;
conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Risks. Inthe EPAP documentation, a number o f risks were identified. Several&#13;
are worth noting. First, it was recognizedthat there is a need to extend the functioning o f&#13;
the core public administration functions outside o f Kabul. This has proven difficult, and&#13;
attainment o f full functionality outside o f Kabul will be gradual. Several efforts, though,&#13;
are underway to address this issue: (i) to enhance communications connectivity are&#13;
                                         plans&#13;
progressing; (ii)   local consultants are being placed in each province to assist the&#13;
Moustufiat (MOF representative) improve information flows and basic reporting; (iii)&#13;
analytical work is underway to better understand both the formal and informal nature o f&#13;
provincial-central relations; and (iv) systems are intrinsically designed for roll out when&#13;
logistics and security so permit. Second, it was noted that if an effective payment system&#13;
was not in place, this would        slow disbursement o f resources.      Indeed, technical&#13;
assistance provided to date on the payments issue has not satisfactorily addressed this&#13;
concern, and payments problems remain acute. The IMF and DFID initially provided&#13;
technical assistance to D a Afghanistan Bank (Central Bank), USAID now has in place a&#13;
program o f extensive technical assistance, ADB has programmed additional support to&#13;
developing the payments system, and the World Bank is preparing a financial sector&#13;
operation with a strong focus on kick-starting retail banking activities. Consequently, it&#13;
was determined that there was no value added in including yet more assistance in this&#13;
area under the proposedProject.&#13;
&#13;
C. BroaderPublicAdministrationIssues&#13;
&#13;
14.     The Afghan authorities confront a far-reaching, complex, and urgent policy&#13;
agenda as nation building and reconstruction proceeds. While EPAP focused on a very&#13;
narrow range o f primarily fiduciary issues-in      line with the immediate focus o f the&#13;
Afghanistan Interim Administration (the predecessor to TISA) to focus foremost on&#13;
enhancing transparency and accountability-over the past year, the authorities have&#13;
gained a better understanding o f key constraints and priorities for fiu-theractions on the&#13;
broader public administration and civil service reform agenda. This section provides&#13;
some broader sectoral background.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Background. After years o f war and centralized state control the civil service is&#13;
ina state ofcrisis. InSY1381 there were an estimated 250,000 public sector employees,&#13;
although the total could be considerably higher than this and little is known about their&#13;
status, competence or efficiency. Management and administrative systems and skills are&#13;
lacking, and Government infrastructure has been severely damaged by war and neglect.&#13;
Untilrecently, a major difficulty inmoving forward on the public administration reform&#13;
agenda has been the lack o f a clear focal point on the government side for developing and&#13;
takingforwardpolicy options.&#13;

 16.    The situation at the beginning o f SY1382 can be characterized by: pervasive&#13;
patronage; inappropriate pay arrangements, with widespread and counter-productive&#13;
salary top-ups; a chronic lack o f professional capacity; probable over-hiring; fragmented&#13;
and duplicated government structures; poor policy analysis and weak implementation. A&#13;
concerted and focused program for renewal and transformation o f public administration&#13;
i s urgently neededto remedythese shortcomings.&#13;
&#13;
 17.    After a period of some uncertainty, leadership in administrative reform has now&#13;
been assigned to the Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (ARCSC).&#13;
The Commission was established by decree inMay 2002, with a relatively modest set o f&#13;
functions.    However, a further decree i s being submitted to the cabinet that will&#13;
considerably strengthen its role and extend its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Although the ARCSC was created in response to the requirements o f the Bonn&#13;
Agreement, there i s a substantial historical basis for centralized responsibility for civil&#13;
service management and oversight.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The 1970 Law on the Status and Condition o f Government Employees (Article 6)&#13;
established two bodies with responsibility for public administration: the Civil Service&#13;
Commission (CSC) and the Civil Services Administration (CSA).           This is a relatively&#13;
orthodox arrangement in which an arms-length commission acts as a check on the&#13;
executive in its hiring practices, while a body within the executive is responsible for&#13;
administrative reform. This Act was amended in a 1977 Decree (1433) that seemingly&#13;
merged both functions in the ''Central Administration o f Employees and Administrative&#13;
Reforms", reporting to the Prime Minister and thus effectively ending the arms-length&#13;
oversight.&#13;
&#13;
20.     During the ensuing 10 years o f Soviet occupation, the ''Central Administration"&#13;
was abolished, while the Office o f Administrative Affairs within the Presidency grew in&#13;
authority, with a responsibility to ensure that the line ministries under the Prime Minister&#13;
did in fact implement "approved" policy. This undoubtedly allowed extensive political&#13;
control over senior appointments. The Soviet period also saw an increasing role for the&#13;
Ministry o f Labor and Social Affairs, with its responsibility for maintaining full&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
21.     After the end of the Soviet occupation, the UN, in a report on public&#13;
administration, suggested re-establishing the Civil Service Administration (1991).&#13;
Seemingly, it was also the intention of Government at the time to merge the&#13;
Administration Section of the Ministry of Finance with the re-established CSA-again&#13;
the CSA was to report to the Prime Minister. However, nothing was implemented and,&#13;
effectively, the CSA was dissolved again upon the arrival o f the Taliban in 1996.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The proposed decree expanding the role of the ARCSC returns to the pre-Soviet&#13;
arrangement.    Now, the ARCSC must address three strategic problems.             First, the&#13;
capacity o f the newly established Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission&#13;
i s low, and yet it needs to quickly assume responsibility in three key areas: (i)&#13;
appointments and appeals; (ii) service management; and (iii)&#13;
                                civil                                 administrative reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second, there is an urgent need to initiate a sensible, step-wise administrative reform&#13;
program that will allow key departments to move forward with restructuring plans, and&#13;
which will allow selective pay increases to key staff. Developing and implementing such&#13;
a program is part o f the development budget but i s not yet funded.      Third, there are&#13;
additional significant funding gaps inkey elements o f the Public Administration Reform&#13;
program as outlined inthe SY1382 and SY1383 indicative development budget.&#13;
23.      Priority Reforms.        The Public Administration Reform and Economic&#13;
Management (PAREM) program within the National Development Budget aims to create&#13;
an effective central Government that re-establishes national unity on the basis o f strong&#13;
institutions. This involves building broad-based and equitable community level&#13;
participation and effective management at the local level, installing strong systems o f&#13;
financial and information management, and using the budget as an instrument o f policy.&#13;
The SY1382 PAREM Development Budget i s presented in Annex I.Within the Public&#13;
Administration Reform agenda, urgent action i s needed to manage interim reforms,&#13;
regulate salary top-ups, and create a nominal roll o f civil servants. These issues are&#13;
described ingreater detailbelow. Inaddition, on the economic management side, priority&#13;
actions are needed ina variety o f areas including budget execution, cash management and&#13;
enhancement o f own revenue mobilization.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Managing interim reforms.      Some ministries are concerned about their ability to&#13;
deliver services and frustrated by the lack o f a short-term public administration reform&#13;
program. They have signaled their determination to seek hrther donor top-ups and extra-&#13;
budgetary support, and to restructure outside o f any overall reform program, unless the&#13;
government provides a clear framework for civil service reform that will allow them to&#13;
restructure andto improve conditions for their staff inthe very short term.&#13;
&#13;
25.      To resolve this issue, a decree has been prepared that would allow a program o f&#13;
interim reforms to be implemented within key Kabul ministries. This would allow pro-&#13;
active departments to formalize the chaotic hiring o f consultants and contract staff, and&#13;
would enable them to place staff on more appropriate fixed term, but better remunerated,&#13;
contracts. Staff whose skills are no longer necessary would be relocated to other units&#13;
within the ministry, or to other government departments. Such reforms are essential for&#13;
competent staff to bepaid andretained, and for managers to be givengreater autonomy in&#13;
managing their departments. Assisting the authorities to implement such a program is&#13;
one key area that the proposedProject would support.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Regulating salary top-ups.     Salary top-ups are not intended to cover any&#13;
specific costs. They are intended to persuade staff with scarce skills to remain in tough&#13;
jobs, on the assumption that there really is an employment alternative for them. Donors&#13;
paying salary top-ups and other miscellaneous allowances to government staff&#13;
undoubtedly achieve service delivery improvements in 'their' project, but this i s at the&#13;
expense o fthe sector more generally. Uncoordinatedtop-ups contribute to wage inflation&#13;
within the sector, and generally entail the movement o f skilled staff within the country&#13;
rather than bringing in new skilled persons from overseas. Most damagingly, however,&#13;
top-ups and other incentives undermine management within the sectors.          Staff feel,&#13;
rightly more often than not, that there is little advantage in responding to managerial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
requests or instructions from within the government-and               every reason to respond to the&#13;
real or imagined interests o f their sponsoring donor. For operational efficiency, there&#13;
must be just one employer, either government or donor/NGO.                            Of course, non-&#13;
government employees can provide public services ingovernment facilities.&#13;
&#13;
27.        Service delivery would be significantly improved by some regulation o f these&#13;
incentives. In practice, there i s little prospect for directly regulating in an effective&#13;
manner the amounts that NGOs and donors can pay. Development and donor history is&#13;
littered with many failed attempts to agree andenforce such caps. What canbe done is to&#13;
require that government employees who receive top-ups beyond a specified amount&#13;
resign from government service. It i s understood that a decree, jointly agreed by the&#13;
Civil Service Commission and the Ministry o f Finance, has been prepared and could be&#13;
passed inthe near future.&#13;
&#13;
28.        Creating a Nominal Roll. There i s still no comprehensive database o f civilian&#13;
government employees (a "nominal roll") that can be regularly updated, though a list&#13;
based upon salary claims made to the center was completed for a single month in&#13;
SY1381. Such a nominal roll is the only way to guard against undisciplined hiring, and&#13;
some evidence is emerging o f a creeping increase, and may m o r s o f uncontrolled&#13;
hiring. The next phase o f DFID supported work will be to develop a nominal roll that&#13;
can be regularly updated, and to verify this against data held by the ARCSC on public&#13;
servants.&#13;
&#13;
29.        The government has coordinated the work o f the Financial Management Agent,&#13;
the ARTF Monitoring Agent and other bilaterally funded technical assistance, and will&#13;
shortly be able to announce that an initial nominal roll has been prepared and that&#13;
concrete steps have been taken to ensure that this is regularly updated and used as a&#13;
control mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
30.       Donor Coordination.           The budget process is government's mechanism for&#13;
seeking to obtain some alignment between a large number o f donors in a fast-changing&#13;
environment. Public Administration and Economic Management (PAREM) is one o f 12&#13;
thematic areas covered by the Development Budget. Annex Isets out details o f the&#13;
SY1382 Development Budget for PAREM.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A. World BankCountryStrategy&#13;
&#13;
32.     A key objective of the World Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) to&#13;
Afghanistan (Report No: 25440 AF, February 2003) is to support the continued&#13;
development o f a well-functioning state that i s accountable to its citizenry and able to&#13;
ensure that delivery o f services in an equitable, efficient and effective manner. This&#13;
project supports this key objective and falls within one o f the four TSS focus areas:&#13;
govemance and public administration.&#13;
&#13;
B. Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
33.     Within the govemance and public administration reform agenda, the Bank's&#13;
strategy has been to identify pragmatic opportunities for action in the short term,&#13;
initiating a set o f immediate reforms which will be supportive o f longer term&#13;
improvements-but      without seeking to over-prescribe at a time o f great uncertainty. This&#13;
approach has been pursedinconjunction with other donors such as DFID who have bene&#13;
in a position to mobilize technical assistance quickly. It has entailed: (i)   ensuring that&#13;
emergency capacity i s in place-especially      in key fiduciary areas-while       launching&#13;
medium-term capacity building efforts; (ii)undertaking extensive diagnostic work&#13;
coupled with direct, hands-on TA and policy advice, to identify and address key&#13;
constraints; (iii)identifying short term goals that are fully-owned by government and&#13;
agreedwith all major donors; and (iv) providing gap financing when needed.        The short-&#13;
term goals that address pressing issues include passing a decree that would allow&#13;
increased wage payments in selected restructured ministerial departments, regulatingtop-&#13;
ups being paid to civil servants by NGOs and donors, improving payroll execution, and&#13;
enhancing budget execution outside o f Kabul. While medium and longer-term issues are&#13;
clearly important (e.g.,addressing deficiencies in skill-set and geographic balance inthe&#13;
civil service that could lead to the need for redundancies or undertaking comprehensive&#13;
wage reform), these measures will take time to implement and may be politically or&#13;
fiscally more difficult. The strategy recognizes that progress can be made through quick-&#13;
wins, and that this could gamer support for the more politically difficult medium-term&#13;
measures. Key to the strategy is to seek to ensure that short-term policy advice and&#13;
recommendations "do-no-harm" interms o f locking inlong-term obligations that may not&#13;
be consistent with the future vision ofthe public sector.&#13;
&#13;
34.     EPAP focused on supporting the first prong o f the above strategy. Through&#13;
extensive analytical work and policy notes, buttressed by intensive dialogue in&#13;
Afghanistan with government and donor counterparts, the Bank identified a range o f&#13;
urgent technical assistance requirements (in areas such as developing a roster o f civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
servants) which were financed by other donors. The Bank is currently working in a&#13;
similar fashion to better understandthe key issues at play inthe administrative and fiscal&#13;
relationships between the center, provinces and districts.       Policy notes have been&#13;
prepared in a variety o f areas, from improving payroll management to streamlining&#13;
government to pay policy.&#13;
&#13;
35.     The World Bank and European Commission are the lead donors for the Kabul&#13;
based, PAREM consultative (working) group. The IMF also plays a lead role on a range&#13;
of economic management issues. With members o f this group, the World Bank has&#13;
sought to build strong collaboration and partnerships with government and donors. As&#13;
noted earlier, the PAREM development budget for SY1382 has now been prepared, and&#13;
the proposed Project would help implement key elements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           111. THE PROPOSEDPROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
&#13;
36.      The objective o f the Project is to assist the authorities to enhance the&#13;
accountability and transparency inthe management o fpublic resources and to implement&#13;
its National Development Budget. Specifically, this includes continued emphasis on the&#13;
objective o f the first EPAP-putting in place, on an emergency basis, capacity in key&#13;
public administration areas to facilitate better use o f public resources, including donor&#13;
funds, for urgent reconstruction and development efforts. A further emphasis o f this&#13;
project i s to begin to lay the foundation for more broad-based civil service reform&#13;
directed at increasing the efficiency with which basic services are delivered to the&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
37.     Success in meeting the Project's objective will be measured by: the delivery o f&#13;
goods, services and works in line with the agreed procurement plan in a transparent&#13;
manner; accurate accounting andtimely reporting on budget execution, including detailed&#13;
reports submitted to donors (to the extent that their resources flow through the budget);&#13;
and the Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission gaining capacity to carry&#13;
out its core functions.&#13;
&#13;
B. Projectdescription&#13;
&#13;
38.     The Grant will finance the continued employment by TISA of qualified firms to&#13;
assist the authorities in carrying out, on an interim basis, government procurement and&#13;
selected financial management functions; develop the administration's capacity in these&#13;
areas; and assess existing systems andprocedures to recommend suitable policy reforms.&#13;
Services will also be provided to assist the ARCSC to develop its capacity to undertake&#13;
the development and oversight o f merit based appointments o f senior civil servants and&#13;
appeals, civil service management, and overall management and implementation o f&#13;
public administration reform program. Further services will be provided to ministries for&#13;
approved restructuring and for studies andinstitution buildingwithin selected entities.&#13;

&#13;
Component 1:Supplemental Supportfor EPAP Contracts&#13;
(US$4.3 million)&#13;
&#13;
40.     The Emergency Public Administration Project was prepared rapidly under&#13;
difficult conditions with imperfect information. No reference information was available&#13;
on the cost o f service provision, given Afghanistan's difficult security and logistical post-&#13;
conflict environment. The EPAP appraisal document recognizedas a project risk that the&#13;
financial support notionally allocated for the procurement and financial management&#13;
agents may have been significantly under-scoped. Duringnegotiations, it was agreed that&#13;
should this be the case, supplemental financing would be sought. Since this eventuality&#13;
materialized, this component o f the proposed Project would provide the supplemental&#13;
financing   necessary to complete the originally envisioned work program for the&#13;
procurement and financial management agents.            The following table provides an&#13;
overview o f the original notional and revised EPAP allocations, and the supplemental&#13;
resources needed. Greater detail on the scope o f services being provided is provided in&#13;
the technical annex for the Emergency Public Administration Project (Report No: T 7520&#13;
AF, March2002).&#13;

41.     Procurement Strengthening (additional US$2.6 million). As defined in EPAP,&#13;
support i s being provided to put in place emergency procurement capacity to facilitate&#13;
rapid, transparent utilization o f donor resources for reconstruction and development.&#13;
This is being achieved by employing a specialized intemational firm (Procurement&#13;
Agent) for a two-year period to assist the authorities to c m y out government&#13;
procurement activities. The Procurement Agent mobilized at the end o f July 2002. The&#13;
terms o f reference for the Procurement Agent also include: building local procurement&#13;
capacity; and assessing existing laws, regulations, and procedures, and developing a&#13;
concrete action plan for enhancing the procurement environment and building human&#13;
capacity. This sub-component is expected to be fully implementedby September 2005.&#13;
&#13;
42.     Accounting and Treasury Department Strengthening (additional US$l.7 million).&#13;
As defined in EPAP, support i s being provided to put in place emergency financial&#13;
management capacity to facilitate transparent accounting o f governmental expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and timely disbursements. This i s being done by employing a specialized international&#13;
firm (Financial Management Agent) for a two-year period. The Financial Management&#13;
Agent mobilized inthe beginningo f September 2002. The FinancialManagement Agent&#13;
works closely with the staff o f the MOF to ensure transfer o f knowledge and&#13;
development of capacity. This sub-component i s expected to be fully implemented by&#13;
September 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: CivilService and Administrative Reform&#13;
(US5.1millionofwhichUS2.6 millionfromIDA)&#13;
&#13;
43.     The United Kingdom, through DFID, is jointly co-financing this component,&#13;
which provides partial financing for critical parts o f      the Government's PAREM&#13;
development budget. There are three sub-components.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Capacity building in the ARCSC ($1.7 million).      Technical assistance will be&#13;
provided to assist the ARCSC develop its capacity in three critical areas:              (i)&#13;
appointments and appeals; (ii) service management; and (iii)&#13;
                                 civil                                management o f the&#13;
public administrative reform program.     In addition, the ARCSC needs to be able to&#13;
provide support to line ministries for costing proposals when they seek priority reforrn&#13;
andrestructuring (PRR) status.&#13;
&#13;
45.     Support to Public Administration Reform ($3.2 million).       The sub-component&#13;
provides technical assistance in two critical areas. The first area assists ministries that&#13;
have approved restructuring plans under the PRR decree to implement those plans. The&#13;
second area i s to provide gap financing for critical activities within the PAREM&#13;
development budget that are not funded by other donors. A total o f $1.3 million i s&#13;
reserved for the first activity. There is a disbursement condition on this activity. The&#13;
disbursement condition i s that regulatory action i s taken to put in place a framework&#13;
acceptable to the association to permit PRR o f ministerial departments. Several donors&#13;
have expressed interest inproviding additional resources to help ministries to implement&#13;
their reform and restructuring plans if the seed financing provided under the proposed&#13;
Project allows the ARCSC to demonstrate a viable framework.&#13;
&#13;
46.     Support for Independent Evaluation ($0.2 million). To support the ARCSC to&#13;
more effectively absorb the technical assistance that would be provided under the&#13;
proposed Project, this sub-component provides resources for a six-monthly review o f&#13;
activities under the first two sub-components, with an aim to assess progress and make&#13;
recommendations to enhance the effectiveness o f the work planningandprogramming.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Additional details on this component are provided inAnnex 11.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Studies and Institutional Strengthening&#13;
(US1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
48.     Studies and Targeted Institutional Strengthening (US$I.5 million).      This sub-&#13;
component provides TISA with flexibility to commission studies that could generate&#13;
quick impact or which deal with key policy issues.       Flexibility is designed into this&#13;

component in recognition o f the rapidly changing environment. The aim i s to provide&#13;
services to various ministries or agencies as may be requested by TISA. Requests for&#13;
financing under this component will be vetted through the Ministry o f Finance. This&#13;
component provides funding o f last-resort if other donor funds are not able to be quickly&#13;
mobilized for a priority activity. Activities will be screened against fit with the National&#13;
Development Budget and/or support to the principles underlying o f the National&#13;
Development Framework (e.g., role o f the state as supportive to the private sector,&#13;
environmental sustainability, role o fwomen indevelopment).&#13;
&#13;
C. ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
49.      ImplementationArrangements. Implementation arrangements will remain the&#13;
same as under EPAP for component 1. A A C A i s responsible for implementation o f&#13;
procurement strengthening; MOF i s responsible for implementation o f accounting and&#13;
treasury department strengthening.      Component 2 will be implemented by ARCSC.&#13;
Under this component, technical assistancebeingprovided for restructured ministries will&#13;
be carried out through the beneficiary ministerial department. Component 3 will be&#13;
implemented by the MOF.          However, no activities will be carried out without the&#13;
endorsement o f the relevant line minister. MOF will simply screen assistance needs&#13;
against available donor funding, and fit with the development budget. It i s recognized&#13;
that if there are institutional changes during the period o f implementation, implementing&#13;
agencies may need to be adjusted. A A C A has recently recruiteda core focal point for the&#13;
procurement unit. MOF and ARCSC will each need to appoint a specific individual as&#13;
the project focal point. Since the project emphasizes capacity building, continued efforts&#13;
will be needed to identify and appoint an adequate number o f civil service counterparts&#13;
with sufficient qualifications to work with the firms that will be providing services.&#13;
MOF will play the overall coordinating role.&#13;
&#13;
50.      Procurement. There is limited procurement activity under this project. Each&#13;
implementing entity is responsible for providing terms o f reference and selection criteria&#13;
to the A A C A procurement unit which, with support from the Procurement Agent, will&#13;
undertake the procurement process for the various firms and individuals to be retained.&#13;
These arrangements should ensure compliance with IDA procurement procedures and&#13;
expedite implementation o f Project activities. Annex IV provides more information on&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
51.      Disbursement and FinancialManagement Arrangements. Since there is no&#13;
Country Profile o f Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country Financial Accountability&#13;
Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate documented knowledge o f&#13;
country issues and related strengths and weaknesses. However, IDA has gained&#13;
substantial insight from the four IDA projects that have been under implementation over&#13;
the past year. The overall assessment is that though the country's financial management&#13;
system i s not fully functional, appropriate mitigation measures are being taken such as&#13;
the engagement of the Financial Management Agent. Additional details are available in&#13;
Annex V.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                             12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52.     Disbursements: Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be made in the&#13;
traditional mode (reimbursement with full documentation and against statements o f&#13;
expenditure) for boththe IDA and DFIDGrant, which will be administered by IDA. Due&#13;
to the nature o f the Project activities, this Project will have a relatively small number o f&#13;
direct payments.      However, provision for a Special Account with an Authorized&#13;
Allocation o f $500,000 will be included inthe Grant Agreement, inthe event such funds&#13;
are needed. This account will be opened and maintained in a commercial bank or D a&#13;
Afghanistan Bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
53.     Audit: The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with&#13;
the support o f the Audit Agent, with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
The annual Project financial statements audited by external auditors would be submitted&#13;
within six months o fthe close o fTISA's fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Monitoring and Evaluation.            Monitoring arrangements include plans for&#13;
intensive supervisionby IDA to ensure that any implementation difficulties are dealt with&#13;
promptly.    At a minimum, a full supervision mission is needed twice a year, with&#13;
specialists visiting Afghanistan more frequently ifneeded duringProject implementation.&#13;
DFID has seconded a public sector management specialist to the World Bank Office in&#13;
Kabul, who will play a key role in day-to-day supervision o f the civil service reform&#13;
component o f the Project.        The Project also builds in twice-yearly independent&#13;
monitoring and evaluation o f the technical assistance being provided under the civil&#13;
service component to assist the authorities in evaluating the quality o f technical&#13;
assistance being delivered and to provide specific suggestions for enhancing its&#13;
effectiveness. IDA will carry out a mid-term performance review. A quarterly progress&#13;
report will be prepared and submitted to IDA, which consolidates all components&#13;
including progress towards meeting implementation and development objectives.&#13;
Responsibility for this reporting rests with MOF, with each implementing agency&#13;
agreeing to provide requisite input. Annex VI provides additional details on monitoring&#13;
indicators for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
D. Justification&#13;
&#13;
55.     Emerging from more than two decades o f crisis, the Afghan administration does&#13;
not have a track record o f transparent and efficient implementation o f a development&#13;
budget. This severely limits the scope for successful implementation o f a large recovery&#13;
program. Furthermore, concerns about accountability couldjeopardize the magnitude o f&#13;
donor support that has been pledged and will be required. Continuing to assist TISA in&#13;
building a nucleus o f implementation capacity (in procurement and financial&#13;
management) and showing credible results on the ground will help the TISA builda track&#13;
record o f performance, while also providing some assurance to donors o f appropriate&#13;
fiduciary accountability for budget resources. The additional activities supported by the&#13;
Project begin to lay foundations for reform in selected key areas o f the public&#13;
administration. Although public sector enhancement is a medium-term objective, it i s&#13;
crucial to set the tone in the short-term with effective support for initial steps in this&#13;
process.&#13;

National Development BudgetAnd Ordinary Budget For Solar Year 1382 (1 Hamal-29 Hoot&#13;
1382).&#13;
&#13;
Goal: To create an effective central Government that re-establishes national&#13;
unity on the basis of strong institutions. This involves building broad-based and&#13;
equitable community level participation and effective management at the local&#13;
level; installing strong systems of financial and information management; and&#13;
using the budget as an instrument of policy.&#13;
&#13;
Program Backgroundand Description: The PublicAdministration Reform and&#13;
Economic Management program is an enabling program vital to the successful&#13;
development of Afghanistan and the establishment of a sound base for its&#13;
Government.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits to the people of Afghanistan include the management and facilitation of&#13;
the Loya Jurga in December 2003 and the election in June 2004. The Public&#13;
Administration Reform and Economic Management Program will also manage&#13;
the major census and statistics gathering program across Afghanistan,which will&#13;
facilitate the delivery of goods and services across the country based on needs.&#13;
&#13;
The program provides a range of services and functions that cut across&#13;
Ministries and support the effective operation of the Government. These include&#13;
the development and provision of financial and management systems and&#13;
support across Government, the management of the whole-of-Government&#13;
program of building reconstruction (considerably lower cost than running&#13;
individual projects in every Ministry), and the development of central policies and&#13;
strategies to reform and improve the civil service. The program will also manage&#13;
a venture capital fund to encourage investmentand facilitate the transfer of many&#13;
unnecessary SOEs to the private sector.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
        There will be one consultancy contract for each sub-component. It i s anticipated&#13;
that the services provided will be primarilytechnical assistance inthe form o f reports and&#13;
training, with some longer-term resident advisers. Once a contractor is mobilized, the&#13;
firm will provide consulting support based on the agreed work plan. Staff to be used&#13;
should meet the pre-agreed qualifications and experience standards and the govemment&#13;
will be providedwith the CVs o f all staffto be usedprior to their involvement inspecific&#13;
tasks.&#13;
&#13;
        Sub-component 1: Capacity Building in the ARCSC.                                  This project&#13;
subcomponent will assist the ARCSC in developing its capacity to undertake each o f its&#13;
three key tasks:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Appointments and Appeals. In order to fulfill its mandate under the Bonn&#13;
        Agreement, the Commission will recruit and promote candidates for senior civil&#13;
        service posts on merit, and will develop and oversee the application o f merit-&#13;
        based recruitment procedures for the remainder o f the Civil Service.                    The&#13;
        Commission will also hear appeals and deal with grievances from civil servants.&#13;
        Two independent Boards are being appointed for these purposes.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Civil Sewice management. The Commission will develop a new Civil Service&#13;
        Law, andwill review and amend as necessary existing legislation on Civil Service&#13;
        employment, and will develop personnel policies and procedures to ensure the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 20 .&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        legislation i s applied in practice.     The Commission will be responsible, in&#13;
        consultation and collaboration with Ministries, for conducting reviews of&#13;
        institutional structures and administrative processes in order to improve the&#13;
        efficiency and effectiveness o f government business, and will develop strategies&#13;
        for enhancing the use o f modem information technology throughout government.&#13;
        A Civil Service Management Department is beingformed to carry out these tasks.&#13;
&#13;
    a  Administrative Reform. The Commission is the focal point within government for&#13;
        oversight, coordination and management o f the Public Administration Reform&#13;
        Program. This addresses seven priority areas:&#13;
        1.       Civil Service legal framework&#13;
        2.      Personnel management&#13;
        3.      Institutional and functional streamlining and development&#13;
        4.      Financialmanagement and accountability&#13;
        5.      Policy management andmachinery o f government&#13;
        6.      Administrative efficiency&#13;
        7.      Physical infrastructureimprovement.&#13;
&#13;
        These priority "pillars" however have far reaching implications for all ministries,&#13;
and a number have begunwork in areas relevant to them. For example, the Ministry o f&#13;
Finance has led on much o f the forth item, and obviously have an interest in the fiscal&#13;
implications o f the institutional and functional streamlining and pay reform policy.&#13;
&#13;
        This subcomponent o f the proposed Project is primarily a contribution towards&#13;
priority area 3 o f the PAREM Development Budget: "Institutional and fbnctional&#13;
streamlining and development."&#13;
&#13;
        The structure proposed for the ARCSC to undertake these tasks is indicated inthe&#13;
figure on the following page, showing the three discrete functions contained within the&#13;
Commission. However the organization structure may evolve differently as the work&#13;
proceeds. The structure has been developed to maintain some distinction between the&#13;
independent oversight functions o f the ARCSC andthe public sector reformmanagement&#13;
tasks. It i s unusual and less than ideal that these functions are combined within the same&#13;
organization but capacity constraints elsewhere ingovernment make this unavoidable.&#13;
&#13;
        In addition, this subcomponent will provide the facility to prepare and cost&#13;
proposals for restructuring ministries and departments under a decree currently under&#13;
preparationby the government. This decree will allow Ministries to develop proposals to&#13;
reform and restructure departments that are carrying out critical functions within the&#13;
Ministry, and for approval for these departments to be granted priority reform and&#13;
restructuring (PRR) status. With the exception o f `beyond' grade posts, Ministries may&#13;
propose that specified posts within Departments granted PRR status should be placed on&#13;
an interim additional allowance (IAA) scale pending the introduction o f comprehensive&#13;
pay and grading reforms; and may nominate individuals for appointment to such posts on&#13;
a time-limited basis and subject to performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
        Granting o f PRR status and transfer o f posts and staff to the interim additional&#13;
allowance scale will be subject to the approval o f a Reform and Restructuring Board&#13;
chaired by the Vice President. The Reform and Restructuring Board will be assisted by&#13;
the Administrative Reform Secretariat within the Administrative Reform and Civil&#13;
Service Commission, which will provide technical analysis o f the proposals. Approval&#13;
for PRR status will be granted only ifspecified criteria are met, which demonstrate:&#13;
    a.      the strategic importance o fthe departmentis concerned; and&#13;
    b.      that the proposed reforms and restructuring will significantly improve&#13;
            operational efficiency and effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
        Approval for transfer o f specified posts and staff to the interim additional&#13;
allowance scale will be granted only on the basis that:&#13;
    a.      the specified posts are essential to the operational effectiveness o f the PRR&#13;
            Department; and&#13;
    b.      staff nominatedto fillthe specified posts are demonstrably capable o f carrying&#13;
            out the requiredduties.&#13;
&#13;
        The subcomponent will provide funding for development and costing o f&#13;
ministries' restructuring proposals prepared under the PRR decree or equivalent. The&#13;
development and costing o f ministry and departmental restructuring proposals i s to be&#13;
separated from their implementation to avoid the conflict o f interest inherent inthe same&#13;
firm both specifying how much TA is needed for a particular ministry or department&#13;
which is being restructured, and also providing that TA.&#13;
&#13;
        The subcomponent i s expected to cost about $1.7 million and would be&#13;
implemented over a two year time period. It is anticipatedthat the services provided will&#13;
be primarily technical assistance in the form o f reports and training, with some longer-&#13;
term resident advisers. Provision o f a limited amount o f goods and equipment is to be&#13;
included inthe consultant contract.&#13;
&#13;
        Sub-component (2): Support for public administrationreform. This project&#13;
subcomponent provides a flexible facility to assist the Administrative Reform and Civil&#13;
Service Commission to implement the PAREM program o f the National Development&#13;
Budget (NDB) in any o f the following areas where other resources and donor inputs are&#13;
insufficient:&#13;
1.      Civil Service legal framework&#13;
2.      Personnel management&#13;
3.      Institutional &amp; fictional streamlining&amp; development&#13;
5.      Policy management andmachinery o f government&#13;
6.      Administrative efficiency&#13;
&#13;
        The PAREMprogram o f the NDBprovides ceilings for each o f these areas during&#13;
the two years inwhich the project will be effective. These are set out in Annex B. The&#13;
amounts to be funded under this project fall within the ceilings provided by the PAREM&#13;
program. It i s anticipated that other donors will make up any shortfall between the&#13;
resources provided by this project andthe amount required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The subcomponent i s expected to cost about $3.1 million to be implementedover&#13;
a two year period. The services and goods will be provided through a single firm or&#13;
consortium. Provision o f a limited amount o f goods and equipment are to be included in&#13;
the consultant contract. It i s anticipated that the services provided will be targeted at&#13;
those areas where other donors are not supporting priorities within the PAREM program&#13;
of the National Development Budget.&#13;
&#13;
        Forty percent o f the value o f this subcomponent will provide support for&#13;
ministries in implementing agreed restructuring proposals under the PRR decree. It i s&#13;
important to note that if the PRR decree, or an equivalent, i s not passed then this&#13;
subcomponent will be reduced by that amount. It is anticipated that the services provided&#13;
by this 40% o f the subcomponent will consist primarily o f the preparation of detailed&#13;
implementation plans for departmental or ministry restructuring, assistance in the&#13;
evaluation o f current staff and in assessing their suitability for employment within the&#13;
restructureddepartment or ministry, and training.&#13;
&#13;
        It is important that the development and implementation o f PRR proposals takes&#13;
place as quickly as possible. The ARCSC, with DFID support, has already begun to&#13;
complete an initial snapshot o f ministries' main functions, structures and senior staffing&#13;
levels, in order to pave the way for institutional streamlining. Individual ministries are&#13;
actively participating in this process. It is anticipated that initial PRR proposals will be&#13;
completed inup to 15 to 20 departments by the end o fNovember 2003, that consideration&#13;
and approval takes place by the end o fDecember, and that implementation commences in&#13;
upto 10departments from January 2004.&#13;
&#13;
        Proposals will be concise and follow a standard format. Technical assistance will&#13;
be provided to develop the proposals but it is important that these do not become overly&#13;
bureaucratic.    The approach o f the proposed Project i s to support the rapid&#13;
implementationo fpublic administration reforms.&#13;
&#13;
        Sub-component (3): Independent evaluation of progress and priorities in&#13;
administrative and civil service reform.        This subcomponent will provide 6-monthly&#13;
reviews o f progress as guidance to the government on the direction of administrative&#13;
reform. This will be o f strategic value to the ARCSC as it develops and refines its reform&#13;
approaches.&#13;
&#13;
        Firms/consortia providing services under the first two sub-components are&#13;
required to provide the government with six monthly reports on progress, together with a&#13;
plan showing the anticipated projects and business activities to be provided under the&#13;
contract duringthe next six months. This component will assist government inits review&#13;
of these six monthly reports andplans.&#13;
&#13;
        The subcomponent will provide professional services o f about $200,000 over the&#13;
period in which the first two sub-components are under implementation. The services&#13;
will beprovidedthrough a single firm or individual.&#13;
&#13;

         Anticipated Achievements. Given the flexible nature o f this component, it is&#13;
not possible to specify anticipated concrete project results.                    However, several broad&#13;
project outcomes can be identified, including:&#13;
&#13;
    a    The establishment o f a sound legal framework for a professional, ethical,&#13;
          equitable and politically impartial Civil Service;&#13;
    0    The establishment o f effective civil service management systems to attract, retain&#13;
         andmotivate qualified employees on the basis ofmerit;&#13;
    0    Functional structures and administrativeprocedures that enable the govemment to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The overarching objective i s the implementationo f a strategy for reform o fpublic&#13;
administration, contributing to a sound, ethical and lawful public administration that can&#13;
contribute to the hture peace, stability and economic prosperity o f Afghanistan, and the&#13;
reductiono fpoverty among the Afghan people.&#13;
&#13;
          Some basic actions inpublic administration should be achieved by the launch o f&#13;
the project component. Ifnot, these will form the initialpriorities:&#13;
&#13;
    0     Controlling employment totals. An employee database has been compiled on the&#13;
          basis o f all o f the salary claims submitted by government departments inmonth 6&#13;
          of SY1381. A further Accounting Entry Module database is being developed to&#13;
          record claims submitted on an accrual basis (Le., the month for which the&#13;
          payment i s due) rather than a cash basis (i.e., the month for which a payment is&#13;
          made. Government has said it will take concrete steps to ensure the nominal roll&#13;
          is regularlyupdated to serve as a control mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
    0     Disciplining the use of salary top-ups. Uncoordinated top-ups contribute to wage&#13;
          inflation within the public sector, and generally entail the movement o f skilled&#13;
          staff within the country rather than bringing in new skilled labor from overseas.&#13;
          Most damagingly, however, top-ups and other incentives undermine management&#13;
          within the individual sectors. Service delivery would be significantly improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 by some regulation o f these incentives. Government has indicated that a decree,&#13;
 jointly agreed by the Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission and&#13;
  the Ministryo fFinance, i s about to be passed.&#13;
&#13;
0 Reducing ad hoc restructuring. It i s understood that a decree will shortly be&#13;
  passed allowing a program o f interim reforms to be implemented within key&#13;
  government ministries. This would allow pro-active departments to formalize the&#13;
  chaotic hiring o f consultants and contract staff, and would enable them to place&#13;
  staff on more appropriate fixed term, but better remunerated, contracts. Staff&#13;
  whose skills are no longer necessary would be relocated to other units within the&#13;
  ministry, or to other govemment departments.        Such reforms are essential for&#13;
  competent staff to be paid and retained, and for managers to be given greater&#13;
  autonomy inmanagingtheir departments.&#13;

                          ANNEXIV: PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A. InstitutionalCapacity&#13;
&#13;
         There are limited procurement activities under this project, all related to the&#13;
retention of consultant services. Two contracts are on-going for which supplemental&#13;
financing   is being sought, and two additional large contracts are to be finalized within the&#13;
first three months o f project implementation. Hence, it i s expected that by September 30,&#13;
2003, the project will be over 80 percent committed. The ARCS currently has the&#13;
assistance needed to provide the A A C A procurement unit with the necessary terms o f&#13;
reference and selection criteria for the consultancy assignments under the component it i s&#13;
implementing. The Procurement Agent i s inplace to ensure that the A A C A procurement&#13;
unitis able to handletheprocurement process.&#13;
&#13;
         Balancing the limited procurement activities and the presence o f a Procurement&#13;
Agent with the post-conflict environment, the procurement risk is considered medium.&#13;
Project supervision will include procurement expertise inmost early missions, and to the&#13;
extent needed over entire period the o f the IDA Grant. Threshold limits described below&#13;
have been set considering these risks.&#13;
&#13;
B. ProcurementMethods&#13;
&#13;
         Procurement under the IDA Grant would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines for Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"&#13;
(January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999). The "Bank's Standard&#13;
Request for Proposals: Selection o f Consultants" (July 1997, revised April 1998, July&#13;
 1999, andM a y 2002) would beused for consulting services.&#13;
&#13;
         Consulting Sewices (US$lO.9 million). A description, estimated cost and method&#13;
of selection o f consultancies are provided below:&#13;

                                                   29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Contracts may also include supply o f goods o f about 15 percent o f the value o f&#13;
consultancy to be brought by the consultants for their use duringthe course o f assignment&#13;
andto be left withthe client, after its use.&#13;
&#13;
        IDA'S clearance of terms o f reference and single source selections will be&#13;
mandatory irrespectiveof the value o fthe assignment.&#13;
&#13;
C.ProcurementPlanning&#13;
&#13;
        With a very limitednumber o f contracts, the procurement plan for this project is&#13;
very straightforward. Two contracts are on-going for which supplemental financing i s&#13;
being sought, and two additional large contracts are to be finalized within the first three&#13;
months o f project implementation. Hence, it is expected that by September 30, 2003, the&#13;
project will be over 80 percent committed. Procurement planning for the remainder o f&#13;
the Project will be done in conjunction with the identification o f specific activities that&#13;
will be supported.&#13;
&#13;
D. Prior andPostReview&#13;
&#13;
        All contracts for consulting services contracts above US$lOO,OOO for firms and&#13;
above US$50,000 for individual consultants, would be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
All other contracts would be subject to post-review on a randombasis duringsupervision&#13;
missions and audits.&#13;
&#13;
E. ProcurementInformation&#13;
&#13;
        The Procurement Agent will prepare procurement information that will be&#13;
collected and recordedas follows:&#13;
&#13;
    1.prompt reportingof contract awardinformation for the respective components; and&#13;
&#13;
    2. comprehensive quarterly reports prepared byAACA indicating:&#13;

      ANNEXV: FINANCIAL        MANAGEMENT       &amp; DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
        Since there is no Country Profile o f Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country&#13;
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there i s inadequate&#13;
documented knowledge o f country issues and related strengths and weaknesses.&#13;
However, IDA has gained substantial insight from the four IDA projects that have been&#13;
under implementation over the past year. The overall assessment is that although the&#13;
country's financial management system i s not filly functional, appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures are being taken such as the engagement o fthe Financial Management Agent.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
        The engagement o f the Financial Management Agent; the government's&#13;
commitment to transparent and accountable financial management; and the use o f direct&#13;
payments for the very limited number o f contracts under the Project are the primary&#13;
strengths of the Project's financial management system.&#13;
&#13;
AccountingPoliciesandProcedures&#13;
&#13;
        The Project will follow standard government financial management policies and&#13;
procedures, including using the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial&#13;
ManagementAgent to recordProject expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
        Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the Ministry o f Finance, in&#13;
particular, the Grant Management Unit (GMU), with support from the Financial&#13;
Management Agent. Consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all&#13;
sources anduses o fProject finds.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
        The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the&#13;
support o f the Audit Agent, with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The&#13;
annual Project financial statement to the Association would include a summary o f funds&#13;
received (showing funds received from all sources), and a summary o f expenditures&#13;
shown under the main Project components/activities and by main categories o f&#13;
expenditures. The format o f the annual Project financial statements will be similar to the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).      The audit o f the Project accounts would also&#13;
include an assessment o f (a) the adequacy o f the accounting and internal control&#13;
systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) the&#13;
eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing.       The annual Project&#13;
financial statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent,&#13;
would be submitted within 6 months o f the close o f fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f&#13;
each year.     The following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit Reports&#13;
Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;

            public resources and implementing it s National Development
            Budget. Specifically, this calls for continued emphasis on
            the objective of  the first Emergency Public Administration
            Project (EPAP),-putting in place, on an emergency basis,
            capacity in key public administration areas to facilitate
            better use of  public resources, including donor funds, for
            urgent reconstruction and development efforts. A further
            emphasis of  this project is to begin to lay the foundation
            for more broad-based civil service reform directed at
            increasing the efficiency with which basic services are
            delivered to the population. The Grant will finance the
            continued employment by the TISA of  qualified firms to
            assist the authorities in carrying out, on an interim basis,
            government procurement and selected financial management
            functions; develop the administration's capacity in
            these areas; and assess existing systems and procedures to
            recommend suitable policy reforms. Services will also be
            provided to assist the Administrative Reform and Civil
            Service Commission (ARCSC) to develop its capacity to
            undertake the development and oversight of  merit-based
            appointments of  senior civil servants and appeals, civil
            service management, and overall management and
            implementation of  public administration reform program.
            Further services will be provided to ministries for approved
            restructuring, and for studies and institution building
            within selected entities. It builds on lessons in other
            post-conflict countries where procurement and fiduciary
            weaknesses have delayed reconstruction programs and put in
            jeopardy the continued high level of  donor support that is needed.
