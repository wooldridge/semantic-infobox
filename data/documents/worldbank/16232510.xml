                                                       How this study was conducted&#13;
                                                       The study conducted both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the&#13;
                                                       impacts of poor sanitation on health, water, tourism, and other aspects of&#13;
                                                       welfare, based on analyses of secondary data. Health impacts are included&#13;
                                                       based on well-established links between sanitation and disease incidence.&#13;
The total economic                                     Water impacts are deemed important because poor sanitation is one of the&#13;
                                                       causes of water pollution that, in turn, leads to costly avertive behaviors&#13;
cost of poor sanitation                                by households seeking clean water. Other welfare impacts are included as&#13;
is equivalent to                                       well, such as the productivity lost at work and in schools in the absence of&#13;
3.94 percent of                                        convenient sanitary facilities when people must spend extra time accessing&#13;
                                                       distant facilities. Finally, tourism is included in the study because poor&#13;
GDP in Pakistan                                        sanitation facilities can influence a countryâ&#128;&#153;s attractiveness as a tourist&#13;
                                                       destination. The analysis has interpreted sanitation to comprise activities&#13;
                                                       related to human waste, particularly excreta. In measuring impacts, it has&#13;
                                                       used standard peer-reviewed methodologies. An attempt has also been&#13;
                                                       made to distinguish between financial and economic costs.&#13;

 Throughout this report, the phrase poor sanitation is used broadly to include both sanitation and water facilities and practices that are poor in&#13;
availability or effectiveness. Poor sanitation therefore includes both unimproved sanitation and lack of sanitation.&#13;

&amp;#12;                          Key Findings&#13;
                          Status of sanitation and hygiene: resources and practices&#13;
                          The current status of sanitation and poor hygiene practices has led to&#13;
                          significant public costs, such as premature deaths, economic and financial&#13;
                          costs due to diseases attributable to poor sanitation, environmental costs, and&#13;
                          other welfare costs. For example, as of 2006:&#13;
&#13;
                          a The coverage level for sewage collection was estimated at 50 percent&#13;
                            nationally (with only 20 percent coverage in rural areas), and only&#13;
                            10 percent of sewerage was being effectively treated. Treatment plants&#13;
                            existed only in a few cities, and few of them were fully functional.&#13;
&#13;
                          a Forty-two percent of the population were living with unimproved toilet&#13;
                            facilities in 2006 out of which 11 percent had access to facilities that were&#13;
                            either shared and/or unimproved.&#13;
&#13;
                          a Approximately 50.1 percent of households had access to improved toilets,&#13;
                            of which 55.8 percent had a sewer connected to a flush toilet, and 29.1&#13;
Figure 1: Breakdown         percent had a flush toilet connected to a septic tank.&#13;
of total economic&#13;
impact on Pakistan        a Of the total population, approximately 50 million people (31 percent)&#13;
of poor sanitation,         defecated in the open, and an estimated 8 million people (5 percent) used&#13;
by cost area                shared toilets. If we combine both groups, we find that 58 million people&#13;
                            (36 percent) either defecated in the open or had access to shared toilets.&#13;
&#13;
                6.63%     a National figures hide rural-urban disparities. While 90 percent of the&#13;
                  4.65%     urban population had access to improved sanitation (that is, the kind that&#13;
      1.57%                 hygienically separates human excreta from human contact), this compares&#13;
                            with just 40 percent of the rural population. In rural areas, 45 percent of the&#13;
                            population still practiced open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
                          All these data indicate the degree of inadequate sanitation conditions that&#13;
                          expose the population to fecal-oral diseases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          Health costs&#13;
 87.16%                   The total economic cost of poor sanitation for the year 2006 was estimated as&#13;
                          343.7 billion PKR (US$5.7 billion). This amount is equivalent to 3.94 percent of&#13;
                          GDP in Pakistan. Of this cost, 69.52 billion PKR (US$1.15 billion) constitutes&#13;
          Health costs    the direct financial cost, which is equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP.&#13;
          Water costs&#13;
                          Health impacts accounted for the vast majority of total economic costs. They&#13;
          Other welfare   constituted 87.16 percent of the total quantified economic costs, equating to&#13;
          Tourism         the equivalent of 3.43 percent of GDP. The total economic impact on health is&#13;
                          estimated to cost 299.55 billion PKR (US$4.93 billion), of which 48.76 billion&#13;
                          PKR (US$801.53 million) represents financial costs.&#13;
&amp;#12;The major component of total health-related costs was from premature&#13;
mortality. The cost of premature mortality is estimated at 216.29 billion&#13;
PKR (US$3.56 billion), equivalent to 2.48 percent of GDP. The cost of&#13;
premature mortality comprises 72 percent of total health costs and&#13;
63 percent of total economic costs.&#13;
                                                                               Figure 2: Breakdown of health&#13;

Productivity losses due to illness are estimated at 40.55 billion&#13;
PKR (US$666.61 million) or 0.46 percent of GDP. Total productivity&#13;
                                                                               by type of illness&#13;
losses contributed 11.80 percent of the total health costs. The major&#13;
component (70.61 percent) of productivity losses was due to diarrhea,                        21.64%&#13;
accounting for 8.33 percent of total health costs. The second largest                                3.72%&#13;
share (21.64 percent) of productivity losses was from ALRI, which                             3.59%&#13;
accounted for 2.55 percent of total health costs.                                               0.31%&#13;
                                                                                                     0.14%&#13;
Total health care costs or cost of treatment comprised 12.42 percent&#13;
of total health costs. The largest share (50 percent) in health care costs&#13;
was the cost of treating diarrhea (6.16 percent of total costs), followed&#13;
by ALRI (38 percent of health care costs and 4.78 percent of total costs).&#13;
&#13;
Water costs&#13;
The water-related economic cost of poor sanitation is estimated as&#13;
15.98 billion PKR (US$262.68 million), equivalent to 0.18 percent of&#13;
GDP. This represents 4.65 percent of the total impact; of this amount,          70.61%&#13;

Piped-water costs (the excess cost made necessary by poor sanitation,                    due to diarrhea&#13;
which is estimated in this study as 50 percent of all piped-water cost)&#13;
were the largest component of water-related costs, estimated as                          Productivity loss&#13;
7.47 billion PKR (US$122.89 million). The cost of piped water accounts                   due to ALRI&#13;
for 47 percent of all water-related costs (and 2.18 percent of total&#13;
economic cost) due to poor sanitation.                                                   Productivity loss&#13;

costs, equivalent to 1.4 percent of total economic costs and                             Productivity loss&#13;
0.05 percent of GDP. The cost of bottled water consumption was                           due to typhoid&#13;
4.67 billion PKR (US$76.72 million).&#13;
The cost of household water treatment was 3.36 billion PKR (US$55.23                     Productivity loss&#13;

Other welfare losses, such as user preferences (which, while intangible&#13;
or difficult to quantify, include comfort and acceptability, privacy and&#13;
convenience, security, avoidance of conflict, and status and prestige)&#13;
and time loss, are estimated as 22.77 billion PKR (US$374.4 million),          Only a few cities have&#13;
equivalent to 6.63 percent of total impacts and 0.26 percent of GDP.           sewage treatment plants&#13;

                              [US$92.74 million]).&#13;
                              Losses to tourism accounted for 5.38 billion PKR&#13;
                              (US$84.03 million), equivalent to 1.57 percent of the total&#13;
                              impact and to 0.06 percent of GDP. The financial costs&#13;
                              included in tourism losses account for 4.98 billion PKR&#13;
                              (US$81.99 million) or 7.1 percent of total financial losses.&#13;
                              Among total tourism losses of 5.38 billion PKR, 93&#13;
                              percent was due to lost tourism revenue, while the&#13;
                              remaining 7 percent was due to tourist illness. Tourism&#13;
                              revenue losses make up 1.5 percent and tourist illness&#13;
                              costs make up 0.1 percent of the total costs.&#13;
                              User cost for solid waste management was estimated&#13;
                              as 147.87 million PKR (US$2.43 million). All of this cost&#13;
                              consisted of the financial burden on households. The cost&#13;
                              of solid waste management is not, however, included in&#13;
                              the total cost of poor sanitation. User cost of household&#13;
                              solid waste management was found to be 147.87 million&#13;
                              PKR (US$2.4 million) which is equivalent to 0.05 percent&#13;

 Economics of Sanitation&#13;
The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) is a multi-country initiative of the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). ESI was&#13;
launched in 2007 as a response by the Water and Sanitation Program (www.wsp.org) to address major gaps in evidence&#13;
among developing countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. The study aims to provide evidence that supports&#13;
sanitation advocacy, elevates the profile of sanitation, and acts as an effective tool to convince governments to take action.&#13;
The first study completed in Southeast Asia found that the economic costs of poor sanitation and hygiene amounted to&#13;
over US$9.2 billion a year (2005 prices) in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Its second phase&#13;
analyzes the cost-benefit of alternative sanitation interventions and will enable stakeholders to make decisions on how to&#13;
spend funds allocated to sanitation more efficiently. Due to that studyâ&#128;&#153;s successful traction, WSP has carried out ESI studies&#13;
in India and Bangladesh as well as the Pakistan study summarized here. ESI studies have also been carried out for countries&#13;
in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&#13;

            The economic impacts of inadequate
            sanitation in Pakistan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Pakistan, the deterioration of the
            environment continues to harm livelihoods and health,
            increasing the vulnerability of the nation's poor. The
            water and sanitation program undertook this study to conduct
            evidence based research to help advocacy in the sanitation
            sector. The study aims to empirically estimate the economic
            impacts of current poor sanitation conditions in Pakistan as
            well as the economic benefits of options for improved
            conditions. This study was conducted on the basis of
            secondary data and hence was constrained by the
            non-availability of relevant data in many cases. It would be
            preferable that information on health education and
            sanitation-related information be incorporated in future
            national surveys. Special treatment and attention are needed
            in the areas where the poor population lives and in rural
            areas, where children are more at risk from diarrhea and
            malnutrition. There is still a need to empirically establish
            the attributable impact factors based on primary data from
            Pakistan surveys for a variety of topics, in order to ensure
            that estimates are as accurate as possible.
