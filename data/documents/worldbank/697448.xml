SECOND HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower         : Republic of Burundi&#13;
Beneficiary      : Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)&#13;
Amount           : SDR 14.3 million (US$21.3 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms            : Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project Description: The objectives of the proposed project are to improve the health status of&#13;
Burundi's population and contribute to sustainable per capita income growth&#13;
by slowing population growth, thus reducing population pressures on&#13;
resources. It aims to help increase the availability, quality and efficiency of&#13;
health services and make them more responsive to the public's expectations.&#13;
Together with the contributions of other donors, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a coherent program to support the government in developing&#13;
strategies to address the most critical sector issues. Specific objectives are to:&#13;
(i) strengthen MOPH's capacity to design and implement key sector reforms;&#13;
(ii) improve the efficiency and affordability of health care delivery in rural&#13;
areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child&#13;
mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning&#13;
behaviors. The project would support policies and investments designed to:&#13;
(a)    strengthen MOPH capacity to effect reforms in human resource&#13;
management (including reducing the shortage of health personnel),&#13;
hospital management autonomy, health financing, quality of health&#13;
services, and maintenance;&#13;
(b)    strengthen service delivery in five out of 15 provinces by supporting&#13;
basic health services and rehabilitating nine hospitals;&#13;
(c)    implement the maternal and child and family planning (MCH/FP)&#13;
policy; and&#13;
(d)    improve sectoral information, education and communication (IEC)&#13;
activities.&#13;
Benefits:           The rehabilitation of health services and the implementation of key sector&#13;
reforms would contribute to improving the overall quality of health services,&#13;
while making them more accessible to the poor at an affordable cost. The&#13;
project is therefore expected to help reduce mortality and morbidity rates in&#13;
Burundi. In addition, the successful implementation of the family planning&#13;
policy and IEC activities would help Burundi reduce its population growth&#13;
rate and promote beneficial health behaviors among the population. The&#13;
project would be expected to have the following principal outcomes: (i)&#13;
quality of health services in the project area would be judged satisfactory by&#13;
60 percent *of the beneficiaries surveyed at the end of the project; (ii)&#13;
management autonomy would have been introduced in all public hospitals,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
with management systems and skills strengthened; (iii) overall sector&#13;
financing would increase; (iv) modem contraceptive prevalence would&#13;
increase from 1.6% now to 10% by the year 2000; and (v) IEC programs&#13;
would contribute to more efficient use of services and greater health&#13;
coverage.&#13;
Risks:              This is a project with above-average risk. The main risk relates to the&#13;
country's unstable political situation; to address this risk, the project has been&#13;
designed in a flexible manner, so that some components could be&#13;
implemented even during a crisis and the project's intended benefits could be&#13;
safeguarded; for example, hospital rehabilitation, implementation of MCH/PF&#13;
and IEC activities, and strengthening of hospital management autonomy and&#13;
service quality could be implemented first in the safest provinces. However,&#13;
implementation of some sector reforms (particularly health financing and&#13;
staff redeployment) could be delayed, since they involve political decisions&#13;
and actions that may not be feasible in a crisis. In case of a continuous crisis,&#13;
the project would be restructured substantially as needed during the mid-term&#13;
review. Other risks relate to: (i) the population's response to MOPH's&#13;
reforms; to address this risk, a beneficiary assessment has been conducted&#13;
and the results used during project preparation; similar assessments and&#13;
quality surveys would be carried out throughout project implementation; (ii)&#13;
the institutional weaknesses of MOPH, since MOPH's commitment to the&#13;
reforms exceeds its current capacity; to address this risk, project support&#13;
would include strong capacity-building activities in areas where MOPH lacks&#13;
expertise; project implementation would be divided among a number of&#13;
different directorates within MOPH, while PCT procurement and financing&#13;
functions would be strengthened; and, the project conditions and covenants&#13;
would enable close monitoring of project implementation and development&#13;
performance; (iii) the weak human resource base, especially the lack of&#13;
qualified health personnel; to address this risk, the project would help MOPH&#13;
reduce the overall deficiency of personnel, in terms of both quantity and&#13;
quality; and (iv) insufficient MOPH funding, which may jeopardize&#13;
improvement of health services, especially drug availablity; to address this&#13;
risk, Government agreed at negotiations that its proposals for health sector&#13;
investments and budgetary allocations would be reviewed by IDA annually,&#13;
and that the draft budget would incorporate IDA's comments before its&#13;
approval by the Council of Ministers.&#13;

I. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT&#13;
1.1          Economic and political context. With a population of about 5.8 million and an area&#13;
of 27,834 km2, Burundi has the second highest population density in Africa after its neighbor&#13;
Rwanda. The population comprises two main ethnic groups, the Hutus (85%) and the Tutsis (14%).&#13;
Despite demographic pressure (3.1% growth per year) on already constrained land, urbanization is&#13;
limited; 94% of the population is still rural. Burundi's GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the&#13;
world, at US$180 in 1993.&#13;
1.2          Agriculture is Burundi's main economic activity, contributing half of GDP and over&#13;
80% of employment and export earnings. Prior to the 1993 political crisis, Burundi was one of the&#13;
few African countries self-sufficient in food. Coffee is the most important cash crop, accounting for&#13;
70% of merchandise exports. The secondary sector is still small (equivalent to 19% of GDP and&#13;
11% of exports) and dominated by the public sector. After 10 years of good performance following&#13;
independence (real GDP growth averaged 5.5% a year during 1962-1972), Burundi's economic and&#13;
financial situation began to deteriorate from 1972 onwards because of world economic developments&#13;
and ethnic violence, and took a further turn for the worse in 1981-1984. The Government launched&#13;
an adjustment program in 1986 and began to move towards a more liberal economic and political&#13;
regime. Real GDP growth averaged 4.8% during 1987-1989. However, the 1990-1993 period was&#13;
marked by backtracking on austerity measures; real GDP growth slowed to an average of 1.4% per&#13;
annum, with negative growth in 1993.&#13;
1.3          The first free elections held in June 1993 resulted in the election of the first Hutu&#13;
president and the acquisition of legislative power by the political party FRODEBU. However, three&#13;
months after his inauguration (October 1993), the president and other key FRODEBU leaders were&#13;
assassinated in a coup attempt led by a small group within the army. This event gave rise to an&#13;
outbreak of violence that left at least 50,000 dead and resulted in the migration of about 800,000&#13;
persons to neighboring countries. Many of them returned in the spring of 1994 following the&#13;
outbreak of larger-scale violence in neighboring Rwanda, triggered by the airplane crash on April 6,&#13;
1994 that killed the presidents of both Rwanda and Burundi. While Burundi succeeded in averting&#13;
renewed widespread massacres, these events aggravated long-standing ethnic tensions and made it&#13;
difficult for the two ethnic groups to reach a consensus on modalities of power-sharing. Sporadic&#13;
violence has continued to occur in parts of the country, perpetuating a sense of insecurity.&#13;
1.4         In September 1994, 12 of the country's 13 political parties signed a power-sharing&#13;
agreement ("Convention de Gouvernement"), which is to remain in effect for four years, an interim&#13;
period during which major constitutional and political reforms are to be discussed and agreed upon.&#13;
On October 1, 1994, a new interim president was sworn in and a new Government, headed by the&#13;
former prime minister, was formed. In March 1995, there was a further change of Prime Minister&#13;
and some Cabinet posts. The political situation remains fragile and needs to be consolidated, in part&#13;
through rapid and tangible improvement in the economic and social conditions of the population.&#13;
For that purpose, the Government has endorsed an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP), prepared&#13;
with IDA assistance in the last semester of 1994, which aims to address Burundi's most pressing&#13;
social needs, and set the stage for restoring long-term economic growth potential (para.2. 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                             Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
1.5          Poverty and social conditions. While overall destruction of public infrastructure&#13;
was limited to communal buildings and small roads and bridges, the 1993 crisis caused a sharp drop&#13;
in both food production and the delivery of social services. In addition, the high number of refugees&#13;
and displaced persons exacerbated the human hardship of the crisis, in terms of the breakdown of&#13;
social bonds, widespread theft, loss and destruction of property. At present, 200,000 refugees from&#13;
Burundi still live in Tanzania and Zaire, while another 600,000 continue to live in displaced-person&#13;
camps within Burundi. These factors have together contributed to an increase in poverty, which was&#13;
already widespread before the crisis. The latest poverty estimates (June 1994) classify 57% of the&#13;
rural population and 59% of the urban population as poor, up from 36% and 42%, respectively, in&#13;
1990.&#13;
1.6          Burundi's education and health sectors were paralyzed for a year from October 1993&#13;
because of the insecurity prevailing throughout the country. Large numbers of personnel fled to&#13;
safer zones while others were killed, leaving schools and health facilities inadequately staffed.&#13;
Equipment, supplies and vehicles were vandalized or stolen and national distribution channels broke&#13;
down. In the education sector, the number of teachers dropped by about 20% in primary schools and&#13;
40% in secondary schools. As of September 1994, many primary schools in rural areas had still not&#13;
reopened and enrollments had dropped by 25% from the level of September 1993.&#13;
1.7          The national health system has relied almost exclusively on international emergency&#13;
aid since the crisis began. The substantial flow of humanitarian relief (which amounted to US$85&#13;
million in 1994) and the efficiency of aid-coordination mechanisms managed by the MOPH and&#13;
donors helped to prevent major epidemics and serious health problems on a national scale.&#13;
Nutritional and health care as well as emergency food aid have been provided in the hardest hit areas&#13;
and in displaced-person camps by international organizations (UNICEF, International Red Cross,&#13;
WHO) and numerous NGOs. With progress in the resolution of the politico-institutional crisis of&#13;
October 1993, the national health system has started to operate again. However, it faces serious&#13;
operational constraints that will require immediate reforms.&#13;
B. HEALTH ST'ATUS AND DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
1.8          Health Status. Prior to the crisis, Burundi's health status was comparable to the&#13;
average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite the country's extremely low GDP per capita. Infant&#13;
mortality and under-five mortality rates were estimated at 110 per 1,000 and 173 per 1,000&#13;
respectively. Life expectancy (47 years) was slightly below the Sub-Saharan average. Over time,&#13;
respiratory diseases, malaria and diarrhea/dysentery have been the main causes of morbidity and&#13;
mortality in the general population (Annex 1). The malaria epidemic has been worsening because of&#13;
increasing chloroquine resistance and the scarcity of other types of malaria treatment. Women's&#13;
health problems and mortality have been especially related to complications during pregnancy and&#13;
delivery. The magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Burundi has become evident only recently.&#13;
With urban adult HIV infection rates estimated at 15-20% and rural rates between I and 2%, the&#13;
AIDS epidemic is a threat not only to public health but also to the socio-economic development of&#13;
the country (para. 1.31). Major disruptions in the delivery of health services and public health&#13;
programs during the crisis have had a negative impact on the country's health status, although it is&#13;
difficult to assess its scope and magnitude. Chronic malnutrition among children under five has&#13;
risen from 26% (1987) to around 40%. Acute malnutrition has increased to 10% among the most&#13;
vulnerable groups of the population, particularly among pregnant and breast-feeding women. The&#13;
crisis has contributed to an increase of AIDS and sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) in the camps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        3&#13;
of displaced persons and refugees in neighboring countries. This foreshadows a further spread of the&#13;
AIDS epidemic upon the return of these individuals.&#13;
1.9          Health services. The network of health facilities in Burundi is fairly extensive,&#13;
providing better health coverage to the population than in most Sub-Saharan countries. 80% of the&#13;
population live within five kilometers of a health center, although access is difficult in mountainous&#13;
areas. Health services are organized administratively at four levels: central, 15 provinces, 25 health&#13;
"secteurs" and 114 communes. Public health services include: one military hospital, one teaching&#13;
hospital, one clinic, and two specialized centers (for psychiatry and tuberculosis), all located in the&#13;
capital (Bujumbura); 26 hospitals located at the provincial (14) and "secteur" (12) levels; and 270&#13;
health centers. Private non-profit religious institutions run a fourth of the country's health services&#13;
(10 hospitals and 70 health centers). Religious health facilities are well-managed and adequately&#13;
supplied, and provide services of good quality, for which they charge higher user fees than public&#13;
facilities. In contrast, the quality of services provided at public health facilities is poor, due to&#13;
chronic shortages of essential drugs and supplies, lack of qualified personnel and equipment, and&#13;
poor management. Buildings are also in a poor condition. As a consequence, despite their higher&#13;
population coverage, Burundi's public health facilities have low utilization rates that are similar to&#13;
those of Sub-Saharan Africa; the average bed occupancy rate is only 51% for hospitals, although it&#13;
may sometimes reach 85% for the hospitals in the capital.&#13;
1.10         MOPH started a few years ago to address the issues of poor quality and management&#13;
of public health services. Rehabilitation of most of the country's health centers has been under way&#13;
since 1989, with support from donors, including IDA under the ongoing Population and Health&#13;
Project (Credit 1862-BI) which has rehabilitated 43 health centers; these efforts began to show some&#13;
results prior to the crisis. In comparison, the problems of the rural hospital network, whose role in&#13;
primary health care is crucial but often neglected, have yet to be adequately addressed (para. 1.29).&#13;
In order to improve management in public hospitals, the Government has introduced management&#13;
autonomy in nine facilities, and intends to extend it to all public hospitals by the year 1997.&#13;
Autonomous hospitals receive global budgetary allocations from the Government and are allowed to&#13;
retain revenues from user fees (in contrast to other hospitals which must forward the proceeds to the&#13;
treasury).&#13;
1.11         Impact of the crisis on the delivery of health services and programs. Public&#13;
health infrastructure did not suffer major physical damage during the crisis: only 45 out of 270&#13;
health centers and one hospital need some minor rehabilitation. However, a lot of equipment and&#13;
nearly all vehicles have been vandalized or stolen and have to be replaced. During the crisis, the&#13;
system suffered from major operational constraints. Most public health facilities were no longer in a&#13;
position to offer services because of the breakdown of supply channels and the departure of many&#13;
health staff. The national pharmaceutical depot stopped supplying drugs to public health facilities&#13;
and budgetary allocations were suspended for several months. Public health programs ceased to&#13;
operate as well. Immunization coverage, which had been high by SSA standards (reaching 90% in&#13;
some instances), is known to have declined substantially in the hardest hit areas. International relief&#13;
aid compensated for the breakdown of the national health system. International NGOs ran public&#13;
health services and programs in the provinces and districts worst affected by the crisis. With the&#13;
return to greater stability, the national system has again become functional: the drug supply system&#13;
has started to operate again and public health facilities have received budgetary allocations.&#13;
However, the acute shortage of personnel remains a serious constraint. The MOPH estimates that at&#13;
present 24 health centers (9%) are closed, three operate without any qualified personnel and 72&#13;
(27%) operate with only one qualified employee; one hospital is closed; five rural hospitals (17%)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
operate without any physician, and 14 (48%) operate with one physician who is also the director of&#13;
the provincial health administration.&#13;
1.12         Health staffing. Even prior to the crisis, Burundi had an overall shortage of health&#13;
staff, both clinical and managerial. The total number of physicians was estimated at 337 in 1991, out&#13;
of which 110 were expatriates. Although this total represented a significant improvement over the&#13;
level in 1987 (206 physicians), the ratio of 17,210 persons per physician was still below WHO&#13;
norms. In comparison, the number of paramedical personnel was more adequate, with four&#13;
paramedical schools graduating 200 students per year. However, shortages of health personnel were&#13;
acute outside the capital because of the uneven distribution of personnel: 60% of all medical staff&#13;
and 95% of physician specialists were concentrated in Bujumbura. The crisis affected the physician&#13;
situation more adversely than that of paramedical personnel. The shortage of physicians became&#13;
heightened with the departure of most of the Rwandese physicians (mainly Tutsi refugees since the&#13;
1970s), who returned to Rwanda after fighting ended in mid-1994. Many paramedical personnel in&#13;
Burundi's hardest hit areas left for safer places within the country, where they eventually found work&#13;
in other public health facilities.&#13;
1.13         Health administration. The MOPH is responsible for operating the public health&#13;
system.  In 1985, it decentralized certain administrative functions to the provincial level: 15&#13;
provincial bureaus (BPS), each headed by a provincial medical director, were to coordinate health&#13;
programs (such as immunization and malaria control), IEC activities, as well as drug supply and&#13;
staffing, and supervise health facilities. However, provincial bureaus had neither the staff nor the&#13;
means to carry out even a minimum level of operations, and sector activity remained overly&#13;
centralized. Prior to the crisis, MOPH intended to strengthen the capacity of the provincial bureaus&#13;
and provide them with the required resources (through support from the European Union); the impact&#13;
of the crisis on the health system has convinced MOPH of the urgent need to implement such&#13;
reforms. MOPH has recently taken two important steps in that direction: its organization was&#13;
restructured to reflect the new authority given to the 15 BPS as well as the autonomous hospitals&#13;
(Annex 2); and budgetary allocations for the BPS were specifically identified in the 1995 health&#13;
budget. Much has yet to be done to assess the full implications of the decentralization in terms of&#13;
staffing and financial needs, and to define the new roles of the administration and autonomous health&#13;
facilities (para. 1.27). Beginning in 1991, the health information system was strengthened with the&#13;
assistance of UNICEF, USAID and the ongoing IDA-supported Population and Health Project. This&#13;
system, managed by the Bureau of Epidemiological Statistics (EPISTAT), is now fairly well&#13;
organized and provides good health data. Feedback is provided through a monthly bulletin which is&#13;
sent to provinces and "secteurs".&#13;
1.14         Health Financing. Although available data on health expenditures are neither&#13;
complete nor fully reliable, total health expenditure in Burundi could be roughly estimated at US$7&#13;
to 8 per capita in 1991 (latest data available), which was equivalent to 3 to 4% of GDP. Main&#13;
sources of financing include: (i) public expenditures (around 70% of total health expenditure), with&#13;
central Government expenditures accounting for only 25% of total expenditure and external aid for&#13;
about 45%; (ii) a health insurance scheme for the civil service (around 16% of the total); (iii) private&#13;
pharmaceutical expenditures, excluding those reimbursed by civil service health insurance (7%); (iv)&#13;
total health expenditures of the religious network of health facilities (5%); and (v) cost recovery at&#13;
public health facilities (2%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                          5&#13;
1.15          Public health expenditure. Compared to other SSA countries, Burundi ranks among&#13;
those with a medium level of Government health expenditure, as a percentage of both GDP and total&#13;
Government expenditure. However, in terms of Government health expenditure per capita (both&#13;
recurrent and capital), which amounted to US$2.13/capita in 1993, Burundi ranks in the lowest group&#13;
of countries, reflecting its poverty. MOPH recurrent expenditures accounted for 5 to 6% of the&#13;
Government's recurrent expenditures during 1984-1994 (Annex 3, Table 1); their share of GDP at&#13;
constant prices gradually increased to nearly 1% in 1993. There are no major imbalances in the&#13;
distribution of MOPH recurrent expenditures (Annex 3, Table 2): personnel expenditure accounted&#13;
for 59%  of MOPH's recurrent budget in 1991 and declined to 47%  in 1993 (reflecting the&#13;
elimination of salaries for the autonomous hospitals which are included in their global budget).&#13;
Drugs and laboratory and surgical supplies are the second largest source of expenditure, accounting&#13;
for 21% of MOPH's recurrent budget in 1993. Other expenditures, including those for equipment&#13;
and vehicle maintenance, are inadequate and have increased at a slower rate than the overall budget;&#13;
they are mainly made by hospitals.&#13;
1.16           External aid financed 86% of capital expenditures for the health sector in the fifth&#13;
Five-Year Plan (1988-1992). A 1993-1995 Public Expenditure Program (PEP) was prepared by&#13;
MOPH prior to the crisis. Total public expenditures planned for the health sector in 1993 were&#13;
significant, equivalent to US$6.4/capita or 3.4% of GDP. However, major programs were delayed&#13;
and could not be implemented due to the crisis. The Government has prepared a draft Public&#13;
Investment Program (PIP) for 1995-1997, which still needs to be refined to take into account all&#13;
donors' interventions and is currently being reassessed. It was agreed during negotiations that the&#13;
1996 recurrent budget and 1996-1998 PIP for the health sector will be submitted to IDA by October&#13;
30, 1995 (para. 3.15).&#13;
1.17          Insurance and user fees. The total expenditures of the health insurance scheme for&#13;
the civil service, managed by the "Mutuelle de la Fonction Publique" (MFP), were equivalent to 75%&#13;
of MOPH recurrent expenditures in 1991 (latest data available). This contributory scheme, which&#13;
started in 1980, provides good health coverage for around 400,000 civil servants and their direct&#13;
dependents (7% of the total population). Benefits cover the costs of ambulatory and in-patient care&#13;
in public and private non profit health facilities as well as prescribed drugs. For the first time in&#13;
1991, MFP did not realize a profit. The major cause of MFP's deteriorating performance has been&#13;
the growing amount of reimbursements for prescribed drugs, due to the increased frequency of fraud&#13;
(use of benefits for uninsured individuals), high prices of pharmaceuticals sold in private pharmacies,&#13;
and poor prescription practices.  MFP's expenditures are likely to rise significantly with the&#13;
introduction of management autonomy in all public hospitals, which will then have a strong&#13;
incentive to bill it for services provided to its beneficiaries. In September 1993 (just before the&#13;
October events), MFP contracted consultant services to help design strategies to address the main&#13;
causes of its financial difficulties. With the return to greater stability in 1995, MFP will be in a&#13;
position to further elaborate on these strategies. Since 1983, private employers in the formal sector&#13;
have been responsible for 100% of the medical expenses incurred by their employees (around 20,000&#13;
salaried workers) and their families. Due to the increasing cost of health care, employers are willing&#13;
to continue contributing to employees' health care expenditures only through a health insurance&#13;
scheme, whose establishment was being considered by the Labor Ministry and the National Social&#13;

M6dicale" or CAM) has yielded only marginal revenues, equivalent to 3% of MOPH's recurrent&#13;
expenditures in 1990. The CAM was introduced in 1984 as an annual pre-payment scheme for&#13;
health care, entitling the card holder and direct dependents to free medical care and drugs in public&#13;
health centers and hospitals. Despite its low price of FBu 500 (US$2 equivalent), unchanged since&#13;
1984, only 20 to 25% of the population is estimated to have bought the card in any given year.&#13;
Several reasons explain this low rate of utilization. First, the purchase of the CAM does not&#13;
guarantee access to services in practice, since drugs are often lacking at public health facilities. As&#13;
revenues from CAM sales and user fees are not retained at health centers but returned to communes,&#13;
cost recovery has not contributed to improving the quality of services. According to 1991 data, only&#13;
14% of CAM proceeds was, on average, used by communes to finance recurrent costs of health&#13;
centers (Annex 3, Table 3). Second, given the low level of user fees for ambulatory care, the card&#13;
does not offer any significant advantage, except for expensive hospital care. Indeed, as the CAM&#13;
system has no qualifying period, the card tends to be purchased just prior to hospitalization, resulting&#13;
in considerable savings in certain cases. Third, non-profit health facilities do not accept the CAM&#13;
since they are not reimbursed for the services provided. For this reason, families who use private&#13;
services (around 30% of the population) may never purchase the card.&#13;
1.19          User fees have existed in the public health sector since 1983, for patients not holding&#13;
a CAM card and for MFP-insured patients who have to pay 20% of total fees ("ticket moderateur").&#13;
Proceeds from user fees at public health centers and hospitals are very low, equivalent to I and 4%&#13;
of MOPH's recurrent expenditures, respectively. The reasons are both the low fees themselves and&#13;
the lack of incentives for public health facilities to seek payment of charges, since proceeds are&#13;
returned either to communes or to the treasury (in the case of non-autonomous hospitals). Higher&#13;
user fees are charged by the non-profit sector, on a fee schedule agreed with MOPH. Health&#13;
facilities managed by the Catholic organization CARITAS had an average cost recovery ratio of 77%&#13;
in 1991, with health and maternity centers having a much higher ratio (94%) than hospitals (49%).&#13;
However, grants received from foreign missions and salaries of foreign nurses often are not included&#13;
in the numbers.&#13;
1.20          Drug Supply. Drugs are supplied by both the public sector and the private sector as&#13;
well as religious organizations. The Government-run national office of pharmacy (ONAPHA)&#13;
represents the country's only local pharmaceutical production operation and supplies 48&#13;
pharmaceutical products (mostly essential drugs). ONAPHA is currently attached to the Ministry of&#13;
Commerce and Industry, with MOPH as its main client. Due to its poor efficiency, ONAPHA was&#13;
on the list of public enterprises to be privatized under the Bank's (Third) Structural Adjustment&#13;
Credit for Burundi (June 1992). Although such an action did not take place prior to the crisis, it will&#13;
be reconsidered when the privatization program is reestablished on the Government's agenda. Drugs&#13;
in the public sector are procured by the national pharmaceutical depot and distributed to the 15 BPS,&#13;
which are responsible for allocating them to health facilities. In an attempt to rationalize drug&#13;
distribution and reduce drug shortages, MOPH started in 1991 to allocate drugs to each health&#13;
2&#13;
The INSS, established in 1962, covers pension, disability and death benefits for some 70,000 workers&#13;
in the private sector. parastatal agencies and the armed forces (the civil servants receive pensions&#13;
from a non-contributory fund).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                      7&#13;
facility on the basis of a standardized list of essential drugs and rational criteria. Despite this&#13;
improvement, health facilities still face frequent shortages of drugs, estimated at three months of&#13;
consumption per year according to field observations and studies.  This is primarily due to&#13;
insufficient drug allocations (MOPH's drug budget was a low US$0.38/capita in 1993) and to poor&#13;
management and procurement practices at the central depot.  During project preparation, MOPH&#13;
designed measures to improve drug availability and management, for implementation under the&#13;
proposed project. However, the European Union has since committed to financing such measures,&#13;
beginning in 1995 (Annex 4). It will assist MOPH in: (i) developing an essential drug policy; (ii)&#13;
strengthening management and procurement at the pharmaceutical depot; (iii) improving drug&#13;
management and use in public health facilities, by setting up drug management tools and training&#13;
health staff in proper prescription practices; and (iv) later (mid- 1996), transforming the depot into an&#13;
autonomous unit charged with the procurement of essential drugs that are competitively priced, for&#13;
subsequent sale to health facilities in the public and non profit private sectors, and decentralizing&#13;
drug distribution.&#13;
1.21         Information, Education and Communication (IEC). The ongoing IDA-financed&#13;
Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI) has helped introduce IEC activities within MOPH, by&#13;
providing support to the then existing Health Education Bureau that had undertaken some activities&#13;
in traditional health education. IEC activities are presently carried out by the Health Education Unit&#13;
(HEU) located in the Hygiene and Prevention Directorate of the MOPH; its mandate is to plan,&#13;
coordinate and control the quality of IEC activities. In the past, HEU has been successful in&#13;
informing and educating the population about public health problems and motivating them to change&#13;
their behavior: (i) it contributed to the increase in vaccination coverage in the late 1980's and to the&#13;
control of the 1992 meningitis epidemic; (ii) it has assisted the National AIDS Control Program in&#13;
increasing AIDS awareness among the Burundian population; and (iii) it has produced high quality&#13;
(even award winning) informational materials. However, increased demands from the various&#13;
programs have greatly diminished HEU's efficiency during the last three years (para. 1.32). The&#13;
need for additional staff proved a particular bottleneck, given Burundi's weak IEC capacity and&#13;
HEU's limited pool of adequately trained and qualified management staff.&#13;
C. KEY SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
1.22         Main sector issues are the following: (i) shortage of health personnel; (ii) lack of&#13;
performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms; (iii) poor management and institutional&#13;
capacity; (iv) inadequacy of the rural hospital network; (v) rapid population growth; (vi) a major&#13;
AIDS epidemic; and (vii) limited IEC capacities.&#13;
1.23         Shortage of health personnel. The reasons for the current deficit of physicians and&#13;
paramedicals are divergent and call for tailored strategies, which will be developed, starting in 1995,&#13;
by MOPH with donor support, including IDA (Annex 4). Even prior to the crisis, Burundi was short&#13;
of physicians and quite dependent upon expatriates (especially Rwandese), who accounted for a third&#13;
of all physicians in the public sector. Given the current shortage of physicians at public hospitals&#13;
(para. 1.11) and the low output of graduates from the medical school (20 per year), it will take years&#13;
before Burundi can meet the minimum norms required to make the system work adequately. MOPH&#13;
will have to design, along with the Ministry of Higher Education, strategies to increase both the&#13;
output of physicians and the relevance of their training, in order to meet sector needs more quickly&#13;
and adequately. The main strategy will be to reduce the high dropout rate at the medical school: out&#13;
of 70 students accepted each year, only 20 graduate. A study done in 1993 with the support of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                               Burundi. Second Health and Population Project&#13;
ongoing IDA project showed that the dropout rate between the first and third years of the medical&#13;
curriculum was more than 60%. In the short term, however, MOPH will have to recruit expatriate&#13;
physicians to meet the most urgent needs for clinical physicians, especially in provincial and&#13;
"secteur" hospitals. Most donors have agreed to finance short-term expatriate technical assistance&#13;
until the number of national physicians available on the market is sufficient.&#13;
1.24         Compared to the scarcity of physicians, the current shortage of paramedicals is more&#13;
directly related to Burundi's crisis. The extent of the current deficit in many health facilities (para.&#13;
1.1 1) calls for the urgent development and implementation of strategies aimed at providing minimum&#13;
services and restoring the confidence of the population. MOPH intends to develop various short term&#13;
strategies, including redeploying existing health personnel on the basis of their individual&#13;
preferences and health personnel needs. MOPH has also decided, with the agreement of the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, to grant travel-related allowances to around 300 staff who would accept temporary&#13;
assignments (up to five days a week) in insecure areas experiencing high deficits. With support from&#13;
UNDP, the Government started in 1992 to design civil service reform, but efforts were stopped due&#13;
to the crisis; given the current political situation in Burundi, implementation of such reform within&#13;
the next few years is unlikely. However, the introduction of management autonomy in all public&#13;
hospitals will provide financial incentives for health personnel, since such hospitals could recruit&#13;
contractual staff under their own salary scales and provide financial incentives to civil servant staff.&#13;
These developments would, in turn, pose new challenges for MOPH, to be addressed in its policy&#13;
framework for hospital management autonomy (Annex 5); for example, MOPH will have to define&#13;
the extent of power that the board of directors of an autonomous hospital will enjoy in defining&#13;
personnel policies (including salaries, hiring, laying off, promotion, training, etc.).&#13;
1.25         Lack of performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms. Existing&#13;
financing mechanisms for public health services have failed to improve service quality and ensure&#13;
equitable access. The vast majority of the population lives in rural areas and has access to public&#13;
health services that are inexpensive but of poor quality. As a result, rural patients have invariably to&#13;
buy expensive drugs and medical supplies from private suppliers, or pay relatively high fees for&#13;
drugs and medical services at private religious health facilities, if able to access and afford them. In&#13;
comparison, salaried workers from the public and private sectors, who are largely urban dwellers,&#13;
benefit from good health insurance coverage financed (at high cost) by their employers. Urban&#13;
dwellers also have access to better quality services, especially at those hospitals the quality of which&#13;
improved significantly when they became autonomous (because of their capability to retain revenues&#13;
and the solvency of their insured patients). Urgent reforms are needed to: (i) increase the sector's&#13;
overall level of resources and ensure adequate financing for health facilities, especially in rural areas;&#13;
(ii) improve access to affordable, quality health services for the vast majority of the population; and&#13;
(iii) strengthen existing planning tools, such as PEPs and PIPs.&#13;
1.26         Increased resources will be generated by enabling the health sector to retain and&#13;
manage proceeds from the CAM and user fees, and raising the sector's overall performance in terms&#13;
of revenue mobilization. Improved equity will be ensured by increasing the quality of public&#13;
services in rural areas, maintaining the affordability of the CAM, and establishing adequate&#13;
mechanisms to subsidize the CAM for the poor. Since 1992, both the majority and opposition parties&#13;
in Burundi have been strongly committed to introducing such reforms, including the eventual&#13;
establishment of nationwide health insurance for the rural population. Government commitment&#13;
remains strong today, as these reforms are essential to building national reconciliation (by improving&#13;
equity and transparency in resource allocation). To quickly ensure access to health services for the&#13;
poor and needy, the Government has included in the 1995 Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        9&#13;
financing of two social funds: one of FBu 215 million (US$0.9 million) to subsidize the CAM for the&#13;
displaced persons and refugees (through a temporary mechanism to be designed and managed by the&#13;
ministry in charge of them); and one of FBu 80 million (US$0.3 million) to subsidize the CAM for&#13;
indigents (through a mechanism to be designed by MOPH).&#13;
1.27         Poor management and institutional capacity. MOPH is strongly committed to&#13;
restoring public health services and ensuring their adequate functioning.   However, the&#13;
overcentralization of the health system, weak institutional capacity at the rural levels, and overall&#13;
lack of qualified personnel pose obstacles to the success of needed reforms. Aware of these issues,&#13;
MOPH has already taken some important steps towards decentralizing key management functions,&#13;
by deciding to grant managerial autonomy to both the central pharmaceutical depot and the public&#13;
hospitals, decentralize drug distribution, and strengthen administration at peripheral levels (by giving&#13;
them  more responsibilities and resources).  However, MOPH has not yet fully assessed the&#13;
implications of these policy decisions. The roles and functions of MOPH (at the central, provincial&#13;
and district levels) and of the autonomous health facilities and their interrelationships have yet to be&#13;
adapted to these new strategies. MOPH also needs to define the extent and scope of hospital&#13;
management autonomy, and the type of regulatory and control mechanisms required to ensure the&#13;
provision of quality hospital services. Another major impediment is the overall shortage of qualified&#13;
personnel within MOPH: the central level enjoys a significant number of qualified key staff but has a&#13;
shortage of qualified medium-level staff, the provincial levels have an overall deficiency in&#13;
personnel, in terms of both quantity and quality, and the entities soon to become autonomous lack the&#13;
managerial capacity to assume their new functions. MOPH will strengthen, with donor support&#13;
(Annex 4) its managerial and technical capacity required to: (i) design and implement its sector&#13;
reforms; and (ii) empower the various stakeholders of the reforms to assume their new roles and&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
1.28         At the central level, capacity building will be provided through the recruitment of&#13;
long term local consultants to assist MOPH in designing and implementing some of the reforms that&#13;
the project will support (human resource management, health financing, and hospital managerial&#13;
autonomy). These consultants would not only provide crucial input in designing and implementing&#13;
reforms, but also train MOPH staff (especially medium-level staff), and strengthen existing&#13;
capacities in policy analysis, planning and programming, as well as in specific technical areas (e.g.,&#13;
cost studies, public expenditure programming). MOPH staff will also receive the support of short&#13;
and long term technical assistance and benefit from comprehensive training programs (including&#13;
study tours abroad).  At the provincial level, MOPH will first ensure that the 15 directors of the&#13;
provincial bureaus assume their functions as provincial directors and relinquish clinical work at&#13;
provincial hospitals. They will concentrate primarily on supervising their respective health facilities,&#13;
especially those with few or no qualified personnel, and ensuring that health facilities have access to&#13;
adequate human and financial resources through appropriate redistribution of such resources within&#13;
the province. The staffing of the provincial health bureaus (BPS) will increase only gradually, as&#13;
resources permit. Donors will strengthen capacities of health staff at the provincial and district&#13;
levels and in the new autonomous entities through extensive training programs and provision of&#13;
external technical assistance (Annex 4).&#13;
1.29         Inadequacy of the rural hospital network. The conditions of health facilities have&#13;
been summarized in paras. 1.10 and 1.11. Most provincial and "secteur" hospitals are unable to&#13;
deliver adequate curative services and backstop health centers in the provision of primary health&#13;
care. Buildings are in poor condition and most equipment needs to be replaced. Although more&#13;
Government resources are allocated to hospitals than to health centers, provincial and "secteur"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
hospitals have never received a fair share of resources when compared with hospitals in Bujumbura.&#13;
Shortages of physicians (particularly specialists) and a lack of consumable supplies have always&#13;
been a critical issue (patients are sometimes referred to Bujumbura even for X-rays). These hospitals&#13;
have also been poorly managed, with no incentives to become efficient. MOPH has elaborated a&#13;
rehabilitation plan covering all 26 public provincial and "secteur" hospitals (Annex 6).&#13;
Rehabilitation works were initiated a few years ago and will continue with the support of several&#13;
donors, including IDA through the proposed project. MOPH also intends to extend management&#13;
autonomy to all public hospitals by the year 1997.&#13;
1.30         Rapid population growth. The growth of the population of Burundi is one of its&#13;
most important constraints to development. With a current growth rate of 3.1% per year (up from&#13;
2% during 1975-80), the population will double in 25 years. The total fertility rate is estimated at 6.8&#13;
children per woman, which is above the SSA average of 6.4. Nearly half the population (47%) is&#13;
under 15. Burundi will continue to face a high dependency ratio (close to 1) over the next few&#13;
decades if this trend remains constant. Despite political leaders' awareness, a major gap has existed&#13;
between official declarations and actions taken: the current family planning program has lacked&#13;
Government support and the modem contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR) is still only 1.6%. The&#13;
recent crisis has resulted in delaying the implementation of important efforts toward reform: (i) the&#13;
population policy statement, drafted in October 1992, has still not been ratified; and (ii) the national&#13;
population council (CONAPO), which was to oversee the implementation of this policy, has not yet&#13;
been established. Long a high priority, population control has become a particularly sensitive issue&#13;
since the crisis; it is therefore difficult to anticipate the timing of these reforms. However, continued&#13;
potential exists to expand family planning services, as shown in the 1987 Demographic and Health&#13;
Survey. Donors, including IDA (Annex 4), will help MOPH implement its Medium-Term Family&#13;
Planning Program; this program, prepared in 1993, has targeted an MCPR of 10% by 1997; however,&#13;
this goal is over-optimistic in light of subsequent political events.&#13;
1.31         The Impact of the AIDS Epidemic. The Government was slow in responding to&#13;
the AiDS challenge; the National AIDS Control Program (PNLS) was set up as late as 1988.&#13;
However, as mortality from present infections rises, policy makers in many sectors will be forced to&#13;
confront the specter of AIDS. The estimated 100,000 AIDS deaths that could occur between now&#13;
and the year 2005 will be concentrated among Burundians who are urban dwellers (although&#13;
eventually rural mortality will predominate), more educated, and female (urban women are infected&#13;
at twice the rate of men). Past gains in child survival will decreased and the number of orphans is&#13;
projected to increase from 18,000 to 90,000 by the year 2005. Under the PNLS, a medium-term plan&#13;
and multisectoral strategy to address AIDS issues have been developed, supported by a multi-donor&#13;
effort. However, the scope of the disease will require greater investment in coming years to educate&#13;
the population, distribute condoms and control STD. Given the availability of grant funds, the&#13;
Government has not requested financing from IDA to help implement the plan and strategy.&#13;
However, the proposed project could provide indirect support to this effort by strengthening related&#13;
IEC activities. In addition, as a part of its sector work, the Bank has started working with the&#13;
Government in conducting an assessment of the socioeconomic impact of AIDS; this exercise may&#13;
influence the Government's assessment of the adequacy of the current level of effort. Reallocation of&#13;
project financing for AIDS-related activities could be considered at the mid-term review if needed.&#13;
1.32         Limited IEC Capacities. Successful in 1989-1991, IEC activities have since been&#13;
hampered by serious problems. At the central level, the planning and coordination unit is now very&#13;
weak and unable to efficiently plan and coordinate the IEC activities of many vertical or semi-&#13;
vertical programs; this problem is further compounded by the absence of personnel trained in IEC at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        11&#13;
the provincial and community levels. The lack of IEC capacity prevents delegation by the central&#13;
office, which has instead to carry out all the activities itself in lieu of planning, coordinating and&#13;
supervising them. As a result, the central office staff is overburdened and unable to respond to the&#13;
demands of all programs. Programs which used to work with HEU until recently thus have a&#13;
tendency to carry out their own activities independently, which creates severe coordinating problems.&#13;
This situation has tended to erode the progress made over the last few years. An analysis of the&#13;
country's IEC situation carried out during project preparation shows HEU to be in a critical state.&#13;
The main problems are:  (a) at the central level: a lack of specialized skills, especially in&#13;
management and planning, but also in research and evaluation; and too much emphasis on material&#13;
production, rather than on planning, coordination, technical assistance, supervision and quality&#13;
control; (b) at the provincial level, a lack of trained personnel to supervise IEC field activities, and to&#13;
train IEC personnel; and (c) at the community level, a lack of capacities to carry out IEC activities,&#13;
either in the community or in the health centers. Inability to carry out good communications&#13;
campaigns hampers the efforts of MOPH to improve public knowledge about individual self-care&#13;
and beneficial health behaviors, including contraceptive behaviors. Lack of research capacity results&#13;
in a poor understanding of health problems by the public, and policy makers' inability to take&#13;
account of the target audiences' points of view. Without this capacity, the family planning program&#13;
would be unable to reach its objective.&#13;

II. SECTOR STRATEGIES AND THE BANK'S ROLE&#13;
A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND EXTERNAL AID&#13;
2.1          Rehabilitation of the health system. Starting in September 1994, the Government&#13;
of Burundi with IDA support prepared an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) for 1995 to finance&#13;
the immediate needs of priority sectors, including health. Its total cost is US$53 million, of which&#13;
US$15.5 million is for health (the outline of the program for the health sector is given in Annex 4).&#13;
The Government of Burundi has submitted the ERP to various donors, including IDA, which&#13;
approved in December 1994 a US$14.6 million Emergency Assistance Credit (Cr. 2668-BI). Of this&#13;
amount, US$6 million should be spent for the health sector. The Emergency Assistance Credit&#13;
became effective in April 1995. This aid, together with that to be provided by other donors, should&#13;
cover the financing needed for the sector's rehabilitation program in 1995; the European Union has&#13;
committed to contribute US$5.3 million in 1995, and other donors are also providing significant&#13;
support to help rebuild Burundi's health system (Annex 4).&#13;
2.2          The Government's sector strategies. Beyond the transition phase of restoring&#13;
health services, the Government wants to introduce the structural reforms which are urgently&#13;
required to make the system operate more effectively and equitably and respond better to the needs of&#13;
the population. Most of these reforms had been defined prior to the crisis but need to be refined in&#13;
line with the new country situation. The Government intends to develop the following strategies: (i)&#13;
decentralize the health system, by giving management autonomy to public hospitals and provincial&#13;
health bureaus (BPS), and later to health centers, and by strengthening their capabilities; (ii) develop&#13;
a human resource policy to reduce the acute shortage of medical personnel; (iii) improve the&#13;
performance and equity of existing health care financing mechanisms; (iv) improve drug availability&#13;
and affordability, by developing an essential drug policy and establishing an autonomous essential&#13;
drug procurement unit; (v) strengthen basic health services and hospitals in peripheral areas; (vi)&#13;
control public health problems, such as AIDS; and (vii) implement innovative family planning&#13;
strategies, as a way to control population growth. The Government has, as a condition of Board&#13;
presentation, submitted a signed sector policy letter, including an action plan and timetable,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, which is presented at Annex 7 (para. 7.3 (a)).&#13;
2.3          Other donors' activities. The country's main donors have made a commitment to&#13;
assist MOPH in implementing its key strategies over the next few years (Annex 4). The European&#13;
Union will support the strengthening of the BPS; initial and in-service training for paramedical&#13;
personnel; and pharmaceutical sector reform, including the establishment of an autonomous drug&#13;
procurement unit.  The European Union, Belgium, France and Germany will finance the&#13;
rehabilitation of provincial and "secteur" hospitals. In addition, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and&#13;
Belgium will support the strengthening of basic health services and public health programs, while&#13;
UNFPA and Germany will continue to support the implementation of the population policy. Finally,&#13;
a multi-donor effort is supporting Burundi's national AIDS program. The high quality of current&#13;
donor coordination is a result of the commendable efforts made by MOPH throughout 1993 and&#13;
1994. The Government has committed itself, in its sector policy letter, to maintain the existing aid&#13;
coordination mechanisms, including regular quarterly meetings with donors to review the&#13;
implementation of sector reforms.&#13;

B. THE BANK'S ROLE&#13;
2.4          The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Burundi. The CAS is being&#13;
presented to the Executive Directors on May 25, 1995 with the proposed project. The proposed CAS&#13;
aims to help Burundi avert a socio-political breakdown and lay the foundations for economic&#13;
recovery and diversified growth, with a view to increasing employment opportunities and improving&#13;
equity, mainly through productivity gains in agriculture and increased access to social services. The&#13;
broad reform agenda focuses on the following: (i) increased equity and better governance; (ii)&#13;
environmentally sustainable, accelerated growth based on private sector development; and (iii)&#13;
human resource development through better quality of, and increased access to, education and health&#13;
services, and reduced demographic growth. The proposed project is a central part of the CAS and is&#13;
included in all three alternative lending scenarios which are proposed in the CAS (Best-effort,&#13;
Social-core and Disengagement). The Bank's assistance to the social sectors in Burundi started in&#13;
1977. There are two ongoing projects: the Population and Health Project and the Education Sector&#13;
Development Project, which have sought to improve basic health and education services. They both&#13;
started in 1988 and will both be completed by the end of 1995. A Social Action Project (FY93) was&#13;
further initiated to improve living conditions among the poor and vulnerable groups through&#13;
subprojects of a social fund aimed at improved productivity, enhanced access to social services, and&#13;
increased employment opportunities. A new education project is being prepared. In addition, sector&#13;
work (FY95-96) is being conducted with the Government on the socio-economic impact of AIDS.&#13;
2.5          The proposed project would form an integral part of the Government's and the&#13;
Bank's strategies, helping the Government to: (i) strengthen MOPH capacity to effect sector&#13;
reforms, including the system's ability to provide quality services affordable to the poor and respond&#13;
adequately to the public's expectations; and (ii) improve the quality and efficiency of health care&#13;
delivery in rural areas. It will also assist the Government in implementing its maternal and child&#13;
health, family planning and IEC policies, targeting reduced population growth and improved health&#13;
and family planning behaviors. Along with other donor interventions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a coordinated and joint effort to support the Government's health sector strategies It&#13;
would complement the efforts of the ongoing health project to strengthen health centers, which&#13;
represent the primary level of health care delivery.&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST PROJECTS&#13;
2.6          IDA's ongoing Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI, US$14 million,&#13;
approved in FY 1988) will be completed by June 30, 1995. Project objectives were to improve&#13;
maternal and child health by strengthening such services and nutrition activities, on a nationwide&#13;
basis. The project is progressing well towards its overall stated objectives. However, efforts to&#13;
strengthen family planning services and design health financing strategies suffered from a lack of&#13;
Government commitment and weak institutional capacity; these two areas will be addressed under&#13;
the proposed project. Project implementation in Burundi has been generally satisfactory in terms of&#13;
procurement and disbursement rates. The main lessons learned from the first project are the&#13;
following: (a) a project is better implemented when the Government is committed, when key MOPH&#13;
staff are involved in project design and preparation, and when beneficiary opinions are taken into&#13;
account during project preparation; (b) managerial and institutional capacities to develop project&#13;
activities need to be carefully assessed during project preparation and adequate strengthening must&#13;
be provided throughout project implementation; (c) strengthening health centers is not enough to&#13;
ensure an improvement in overall health service delivery; (d) rehabilitation activities should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
emphasize equally physical and qualitative inputs and outputs (increased service capacity and&#13;
quality); and (e) key functions, such as project coordination, procurement and accounting need to be&#13;
strengthened. Another major lesson learned from the implementation of such projects in other&#13;
countries is that the transfer of health policy and management responsibility to decentralized levels&#13;
and autonomous entities needs to be gradual and accompanied by adequate transfers of authority and&#13;
financial, physical and human resources.&#13;
2.7           The design of the proposed project has incorporated all these lessons by: (a)&#13;
involving MOPH officials and high-level staff in project design and preparation, and carrying out&#13;
beneficiary assessment during project preparation (other assessments will be conducted throughout&#13;
project implementation); (b) requesting a draft letter of sector policy that could serve as a monitoring&#13;
tool during annual and mid-term reviews; (c) recruiting high-level local consultants qualified in areas&#13;
of MOPH deficiency; (d) rehabilitating hospitals to improve their capacity to backstop the first level&#13;
of care; (e) ensuring that, within three months of being granted autonomy, public hospitals have&#13;
adopted the related regulations and by-laws and that, within six months after their rehabilitation,&#13;
project hospitals have introduced management accounting systems and training programs in hospital&#13;
management, and have sufficient staffing; (f) strengthening coordination, procurement and&#13;
accounting functions within the PCT; and (g) ensuring progressive management autonomy for&#13;
hospitals and BPS, with transfer of adequate material and financial resources and strengthening of&#13;
their management capacities.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1.          The project was appraised in May 1993 but negotiations could not take place&#13;
because of the October 1993 events. The installation of a new Government in September 1994&#13;
enabled various donors, including IDA, to redefine and coordinate their activities in the sector. The&#13;
project was re-appraised in December 1994. Its content has been redefined on the basis of the new&#13;
priorities of MOPH and other donors' interventions. The project and the contributions of other&#13;
donors (Annex 4) together constitute a coherent program to support the Government in its efforts to&#13;
develop and implement all the sector strategies defined in its sector policy letter.&#13;
3.2           The objectives of the proposed Second Health and Population Project are to improve&#13;
the health status of Burundi's population and contribute to sustainable per capita growth by slowing&#13;
population growth, thus reducing population pressures on resources. The project aims to do this by&#13;
increasing the availability, quality and efficiency of health services and making them more&#13;
responsive to the public's expectations. Specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen MOPH's capacity to&#13;
design and implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the availability and quality of health care&#13;
delivery in rural areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child&#13;
mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning behaviors.  Project&#13;
components consist of: (i) strengthening MOPH's capacity to effect key sector reforms in human&#13;
resource management, hospital management autonomy, health financing, quality of health services,&#13;
and maintenance; (ii) strengthening service delivery in five out of 15 provinces, by supporting basic&#13;
health services and rehabilitating nine hospitals; (iii) implementing the maternal and child and family&#13;
planning (MCH/FP) policy; and (iv) improving IEC activities.&#13;
3.3.          Given the country's current political situation, the project has been designed in a&#13;
flexible manner to permit the implementation of certain activities even in a context of a renewed&#13;
political crisis and insecurity in certain parts of the country. Rehabilitation of project hospitals&#13;
would be done in three phases that would be modified according to the prevailing state of security,&#13;
starting with hospitals located in the safest provinces. Likewise, management autonomy and health&#13;
service quality would first be strengthened in these hospitals. Implementation of MCH/FP policy and&#13;
IEC activities at the provincial and community levels also would first be carried out in the safest&#13;
areas of the country. Activities to support design and implementation of sector reforms would be the&#13;
most affected by a renewed crisis, although some reforms (such as implementing strategies to reduce&#13;
shortage of health personnel and strengthening hospital management autonomy) could be tailored and&#13;
implemented more quickly to address a new crisis. However, reforms aimed at improving existing&#13;
financing mechanisms and redeploying health personnel could be delayed, since they involve&#13;
political decisions or actions that may not be feasible in an aggravated crisis. In case of a continuous&#13;
crisis, the project would be restructured substantially as needed during the mid-term review. Finally,&#13;
it was agreed with MOPH and other donors that flexibility would be introduced in the project's&#13;
financing to address emerging new sector priorities, as well as permit eventual co-financing from&#13;
other donors during implementation. Existing aid coordination mechanisms, including quarterly&#13;
meetings with donors, will permit regular updating of sector priorities and reallocation of donor&#13;
support if necessary.&#13;

B.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Component 1: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Total Cost: US$7.7 million&#13;
IDA Contribution: US$5.3 million&#13;
3.4          Human resource development and management. The main objective is to assist&#13;
MOPH in designing and implementing strategies to reduce the current shortage of medical personnel&#13;
and correct the geographical imbalance in the distribution of such personnel. These strategies would&#13;
include: (i) annual recruitment of new graduates; (ii) redeployment of personnel, based on the&#13;
demand for, as well as individual preferences of, health personnel; (iii) payment of travel-related&#13;
allowances to paramedical personnel willing to work on temporary assignments in the most insecure&#13;
areas of the country; (iv) short-term recruitment of expatriate physicians, if possible from within the&#13;
region, to provide emergency replacement technical assistance; (v) negotiation of contracts with&#13;
private religious health facilities for the management of health centers in hardship areas; and (vi)&#13;
support for initial and in-service training of medical personnel. Given the crucial importance of the&#13;
issue, the MOPH intends to start designing some of the strategies in 1995, with PPF financing. The&#13;
proposed project would result in the following outcomes: (i) a redeployment plan would be designed&#13;
by mid-1996; (ii) existing health staff would be redeployed by the end of 1997; and (iii) personnel&#13;
needs, as defined by MOPH, would be fulfilled by the year 2000 (Annex 8).&#13;
3.5          As preliminary tasks, the MOPH will carry out with PPF support a thorough&#13;
inventory of active personnel, by health facility and province, and a survey of the medical personnel&#13;
who are currently not at their posts. It will then assess priority staffing needs over the next five&#13;
years. A human resource committee composed of key MOPH officials in charge of directorates and&#13;
programs has been set up to lead these activities. The Government would submit to IDA for its&#13;
review a detailed assessment of total personnel needs within the public health sector as a condition&#13;
of credit effectiveness (para. 7.4(a)). Staffing needs for physicians in the nine project hospitals have&#13;
been estimated on the basis of their current staffing (both national and expatriate). It was assumed&#13;
that half the number of additional physicians needed would be Burundi nationals recruited by MOPH&#13;
and the other half would be expatriate physicians, financed under the proposed project. These needs&#13;
will be reassessed shortly in the context of a detailed study on the current situation of the nine&#13;
hospitals, to be carried out under PPF financing (para. 3.22). The project would ensure that the&#13;
adequate number of health personnel would be assigned by MOPH to the nine project hospitals (para&#13;
3.23). Paramedicals who would be willing to work in insecure areas would be given a per diem (as a&#13;
travel-related allowance) per day spent away from their current place of residence. The staff would&#13;
be asked to work four-five days in these areas and would return either each night or each weekend to&#13;
their current place of residence. These allowances would be time-bound and would be eliminated as&#13;
these areas return to more stability. These allowances have been calculated at one-third of MOPH&#13;
approved per diem rates for civil servants (i.e. 500 FBu, or US$2/day). It was assumed that about&#13;
one fourth of the total number of paramedicals (i.e. 300 staff) would be given these temporary&#13;
assignments. However, the exact number of staff would be identified by MOPH during its&#13;
assessment of total personnel needs (see above). The effectiveness of these allowances would be&#13;
assessed during the mid-term review (para. 5.8) and the system would be modified if required.&#13;
3.6          Project support has been identified taking into account other donors' interventions&#13;
(Annex 4). The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) computerization of human resource management&#13;
at the central level, including: design of the data processing system; personnel training in use of the&#13;
system; purchase of four computers; and financing of the system's operating costs on a declining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                      17&#13;
basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter); (ii)&#13;
redeployment of personnel; (iii) provision of travel-related allowances to around 300 paramedical&#13;
personnel, which would be financed by the proposed project on a declining basis (70% during the&#13;
first three years and 50% thereafter); (iv) recruitment of expatriate physicians, if possible from&#13;
within the region, to gradually fill emergency needs in the nine hospitals covered by the project (15&#13;
physicians in all by the end of the project, for a total of 48 person-years, to be remunerated on the&#13;
basis of UN volunteer salary scales); and (v) specific support for the medical school, including a&#13;
study on the reasons for the high dropout rate, and 20 scholarships to finance local operational&#13;
research for students in their last year of medical school. The recurrent costs that these activities&#13;
would generate at project completion were assessed, and can be absorbed by MOPH's budget (para.&#13;
4.4). Project activities would be managed and supervised by the Directorate for Health Services in&#13;
cooperation with the Training Unit for paramedicals in the General Directorate for Health (Direction&#13;
Generale de la Sante or DGS).&#13;
3.7          Management autonomy for public hospitals.  In assisting MOPH to extend&#13;
management autonomy to all (21 remaining) public hospitals in the next two to three years, the&#13;
proposed project would enhance the effectiveness of public hospital management and help improve&#13;
the overall quality of Burundi's health care services. Development of the policy framework needed&#13;
for such reform will be based on an evaluation of the six general hospitals which were gradually&#13;
made autonomous starting in 1992 and thereby maintained relatively efficient operations during the&#13;
crisis.&#13;
3.8          The project would support MOPH in: (i) conducting an audit in the six autonomous&#13;
public hospitals in 1995 and organizing a national seminar on management autonomy (under PPF&#13;
financing); (ii) elaborating a policy framework for management autonomy that would define the roles&#13;
and powers of the boards of directors of autonomous hospitals and those of MOPH, including the&#13;
powers of MOPH's central and provincial (BPS) authorities (an outline of key topics is in Annex 5);&#13;
(iii) designing standardized management accounting systems (accounting, invoices and receipts, etc.)&#13;
and hospital management training programs; (iv) setting up these systems and programs in the nine&#13;
hospitals to be rehabilitated under the project; and (v) computerizing accounting systems after three&#13;
years of operation. Standardized management accounting systems and training programs would be&#13;
set up in other public hospitals under rehabilitation projects financed by the European Union,&#13;
Belgium and France (Annex 6). Management accounting systems are expected to be in place, with&#13;
the staff trained, in the nine project hospitals by the end of 1997, and in all public hospitals by the&#13;
end of 1999 (Annex 8). MOPH will ensure that each hospital has at least one accountant (which is&#13;
often already the case), recruiting one if needed. During negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that: (i) not later than December 31, 1995, it would prepare a policy framework, draft&#13;
regulations and by-laws for autonomous public hospitals, based on an audit of the six presently&#13;
autonomous public hospitals; (ii) not later than March 31, 1996, it would adopt a policy framework,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, including a timetable for implementation; (iii) not later than June 30, 1996, it&#13;
would cause each existing autonomous public hospital to adopt the new regulations and by-laws;&#13;
and (iv) thereafter, it would cause each new autonomous public hospital to adopt the regulations and&#13;
by-laws within three months of its autonomy (para. 7.2. (a)).&#13;
3.9          The proposed project would finance: (i) local and international short-term&#13;
consultants; (ii) study tours in other African countries; (iii) training workshops for personnel in the&#13;
nine hospitals throughout project implementation; and (iv) acquisition of technical documentation.&#13;
Two high-level local consultants would be recruited for 24 and 18 months, respectively, to assist&#13;
MOPH in carrying out the activities described above. International consultants would provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                             Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
additional support for the initial phase of designing management accounting systems and training&#13;
programs. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not later than six months&#13;
after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference and selection procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, two local consultants to design and set up standardized management accounting&#13;
systems and training programs in hospital management in the autonomous public hospitals (para.&#13;
7.2 (b)). Project activities related to hospital accounting systems would be supervised by a steering&#13;
committee chaired by the Director of General Inspectorate for Health (Inspection Ginerale de la&#13;
Sante or IGS), and activities under the management training program would be supervised by the&#13;
Training Unit of the DGS.&#13;
3.10         Improvement of health financing mechanisms. The main objective is to enhance&#13;
the performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms by improving: (i) current payment&#13;
mechanisms for health care, especially the pre-payment scheme (CAM); and (ii) budget processes,&#13;
including the PEP, PIP, Technical Cooperation Program (TCP), and budget preparation.&#13;
3.11         Improvement of the CAMSystem. The original project was meant to assist MOPH in&#13;
setting up health insurance for the rural population. Because of the recent events in the country, that&#13;
objective -- although not to be abandoned -- would have to be approached differently. As agreed&#13;
with the Government, the CAM would initially be improved as a first step towards the eventual&#13;
introduction of a broader health insurance program, once the CAM has been widely accepted by the&#13;
population and has yielded significant financial results. To improve current financing mechanisms,&#13;
the health sector should first be allowed to retain and manage the proceeds of cost recovery (CAM&#13;
and user fees). This would entail an amendment to the Communal and Financial laws which now&#13;
authorize the communes and the Treasury to collect revenues and use them for purposes other than&#13;
financing health care. Other requirements were defined by beneficiaries themselves in an assessment&#13;
conducted during project preparation. Based on that review, beneficiaries could be induced to&#13;
purchase the CAM regularly and at a higher price if: (i) the quality of public health services visibly&#13;
improved, especially with respect to year-round availability of drugs, improved behaviors towards&#13;
patients on the part of health personnel, and more transparent management; and (ii) the CAM was&#13;
usable at non-profit health facilities.&#13;
3.12         The proposed project would support MOPH  in designing and implementing&#13;
strategies aimed at: (i) managing health sector revenues generated by the CAM and user fees; (ii)&#13;
enhancing revenue mobilization by making the CAM and user fees more attractive to the population&#13;
and to health care providers; and (iii) subsidizing the CAM for indigent people through the&#13;
establishment of a social fund. Further information would be obtained from future surveys aimed at&#13;
assessing beneficiaries' capacity to pay and their reactions to future changes. These surveys would&#13;
be repeated throughout the project implementation period to test the impact of price increases on the&#13;
accessibility of health care. A study of the costs of health care in the public and non-profit private&#13;
sectors would be conducted to evaluate the financing needs of public health centers and hospitals;&#13;
the study would also help to design management tools to be set up for the health centers. The&#13;
proposed project is expected to produce the following outcomes (Annex 8): (i) by June 1997 at the&#13;
latest, the health sector would be authorized to retain revenues from the CAM and user fees, and&#13;
adequate financial mechanisms would be put in place; and (ii) revenues from CAM would be&#13;
equivalent to 20% of MOPH's recurrent budget by the end of 1998, rising to 30% by the year 2000.&#13;
These outcomes are based on the assumption that: the price of the CAM would be increased from&#13;
FBu 500 per annum (its present level) to FBu 1,000 in 1998 and to FBu 1,500 in 2000; and that the&#13;
number of families purchasing the CAM would increase from 25% in 1993 to 50% in 1998 and 60%&#13;
in 2000.&#13;

Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        19&#13;
3.13          A full-time local consultant would be hired and assigned to the Unit in charge of&#13;
"Planning and Coordination of Studies, Programs and Budgets", with responsibility for developing&#13;
health care financing strategies. The consultant would coordinate all the activities described above&#13;
and train the Planning Unit's staff. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not&#13;
later than six months after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference and&#13;
selection procedures acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to improve the CAM (para. 7.2(b)). At&#13;
the mid-term review, the Government and IDA would review progress made in achieving the&#13;
following results (para. 5.8): (i) proceeds from the CAM and user fees are retained and managed&#13;
transparently by the health sector; (ii) the availability and affordability of drugs have improved; (iii)&#13;
the price of the CAM and user fees have been increased in accordance with the recommendations&#13;
made in the context of the project; (iv) the CAM enables access to health services provided by the&#13;
private non-profit health facilities; and (v) mechanisms to subsidize (partially or totally) the CAM for&#13;
indigent people have been set up.&#13;
3.14          The proposed project would finance: (i) a local consultant for the duration of the&#13;
project, as well as several months of international technical assistance; (ii) qualitative surveys on&#13;
both the population's financial capacity and the affordability of health services; (iii) a study on the&#13;
.cost of health services; (iv) the purchase of a vehicle and a computer for the Planning Unit, and the&#13;
financing of associated recurrent costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years of&#13;
project implementation and 50% thereafter); and (v) the cost of an agent and transport means (15&#13;
motorcycles), assuming the BPS will issue the CAM. The social fund, aimed at subsidizing the&#13;
CAM for indigent people, would be financed by KfW and from the Government's counterpart funds&#13;
for the project. It would provide partial or total exemption to indigent people, under institutional and&#13;
management mechanisms to be defined in the context of the project; it would not include subsidies&#13;
for displaced persons and refugees, since these persons would receive specific assistance from the&#13;
Government. It is estimated that the incremental recurrent costs after the project is completed&#13;
generated by these strategies can be absorbed by MOPH's budget (para. 4.4).&#13;
3.15          Public expenditures. Public health expenditures are insufficient for present and&#13;
future needs. The improved quality of services expected by the population, including a reliable&#13;
supply of drugs, will require the Government to make rapid and significant increases in non-wage&#13;
expenditures in the sector (especially for drugs and maintenance); MOPH and IDA have identified&#13;
the increases required in the next few years. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances&#13;
that, in preparing its rolling public investment program and its annual budget, it would: (i) not later&#13;
than October 31 of each year, submit to IDA for its review and comments its investments and&#13;
budgetary allocations proposals for the health sector; and (ii) take into account IDA 's comments in&#13;
finalizing the draft budget before it is sent to the Council of Ministers for approval (para. 7.2(c)).&#13;
3.16          The objective of this sub-component is to improve existing monitoring tools (PEP,&#13;
PIP, and TCP) and to strengthen the capacity of the Planning Unit in charge of their development. It&#13;
was agreed with MOPH that a high-level local consultant trained as an economist would be hired to&#13;
strengthen the unit's current capabilities, including two staff. This local consultant would be&#13;
contracted on a full-time basis throughout the duration of the project. In addition, international&#13;
technical assistance would be provided for a period of two years, starting in 1995, with support from&#13;
Belgium (Annex 4). The proposed project would finance: (i) a local consultant for the entire&#13;
duration of the project; (ii) training workshops; (iii) a study tour in Africa for three persons; (iv) a&#13;
vehicle and a computer for the Planning Unit; and (v) the associated incremental recurrent costs on a&#13;
declining basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter). The&#13;
Unit would manage all these activities. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
not later than six months after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference&#13;
and selection procedures acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to assist in the preparation of the&#13;
public expenditure program in health (para. 7.2. (b)).&#13;
3.17         Quality evaluation and management.  The objective is to assist MOPH in&#13;
developing quality standards and norms for health programs and services, and monitoring their&#13;
application, towards improved delivery of health services in Burundi. This objective is part of&#13;
MOPH's decentralization strategy and aims to build capacity at decentralized levels to evaluate and&#13;
improve service quality in relation to patients' expectations. Manuals of norms and standards would&#13;
initially be designed for each level of the health care system, supported by several seminars and&#13;
working groups led by a Quality Committee to be set up in MOPH in 1995 (under financing from the&#13;
Japanese PHRD Grant). This committee would include representatives of MOPH's Directorates and&#13;
programs and would be chaired by the Inspector General of Health. A protocol for quality&#13;
assessment and management would be designed in one of the five provinces covered by the project,&#13;
based on a survey of health facilities (using agreed evaluation criteria) and qualitative surveys of the&#13;
population, patients and health care providers. Protocols would also be designed for annual routine&#13;
evaluations (of lesser scope and shorter duration) to be carried out in each of the five provinces by&#13;
the BPS, with the assistance of national consultants. At the end of each annual evaluation process, a&#13;
workshop, including key provincial health staff, would be organized by the BPS to discuss evaluation&#13;
results and identify strategies to improve quality and better respond to patients' expectations.&#13;
3.18         The proposed project would finance: (i) regular training of personnel and the&#13;
periodic updating of manuals of standards and norms: (ii) design of the protocol for evaluation; (iii)&#13;
annual evaluation workshops in the five provinces where the project is being implemented; (iv) a&#13;
final evaluation of the quality of health services in the five provinces, upon project completion; and&#13;
(v) support for IGS through the funding of a new vehicle and computer, and the financing of the&#13;
associated incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50%&#13;
thereafter). Protocols developed under the project will be used by MOPH to carry out qualitative&#13;
evaluations in the other 10 provinces with the support of donor-financed projects (European Union,&#13;
Belgium). Project activities would be managed by IGS and supervised by the Quality Committee.&#13;
3.19         National maintenance strategy. Designed during project preparation, the national&#13;
maintenance strategy supports: (i) maintenance of heavy and sophisticated medical equipment, and&#13;
related training of personnel, by suppliers; (ii) maintenance of other medical equipment and hospital&#13;
fittings by three regional maintenance units just set up and equipped under the ongoing IDA-&#13;
supported Health and Population Project; and (iii) routine maintenance of small equipment by the&#13;
hospitals' maintenance facilities, which will be renovated and equipped under ongoing hospital&#13;
rehabilitation projects financed by donors.  The proposed project would seek to ensure the&#13;
implementation of these strategies, especially in the project hospitals. However, financing under the&#13;
proposed credit would be limited to a vehicle for each of the maintenance units. These units are soon&#13;
to become autonomous or private entities, depending on the recommendations of the feasibility study&#13;
to be started shortly under the ongoing IDA-supported project, which is to determine the best legal&#13;
status for these units (autonomous public, private, or semi-public entities) and their capacity to be&#13;
self-sufficient. Public or private hospitals will be expected to sign annual maintenance contracts with&#13;
the three units. These contracts will be financed out of the hospitals' own resources (CAM, user fees&#13;
and MOPH budget allocations), and by financial support provided under rehabilitation projects&#13;
financed by donors, including IDA (para. 3.24). This last source of financing will gradually diminish&#13;
as the first source grows. Implementation of the national maintenance strategy would be supervised&#13;
by the Directorate for Health Logistics, within MOPH.&#13;

Component 2: Strengthening Service Delivery&#13;
Total Cost: US$19.8 million&#13;
IDA Contribution: US$7.1 million&#13;
3.20         Strengthening basic health care services in five provinces. The objective is to&#13;
restore the health services and activities of public health centers (Centres de Sante or CS) and&#13;
provincial health bureaus (BPS) located in the five provinces covered by the project: Bururi,&#13;
Kayanza, Muramvya, Muyinga and Ngozi. These five provinces include a population of 2.2 million&#13;
(40% of the total), served by 11 public hospitals and 73 public CS. The project would finance a&#13;
study in 1995 to evaluate the detailed rehabilitation needs of the BPS and CS in the five provinces,&#13;
especially the 19 health centers receiving no assistance under other donor-supported projects&#13;
(UNICEF, Belgium). The referral system would be reinforced by establishing a communications&#13;
network between the hospital and the main CS in the five provinces. The rehabilitation of two CS&#13;
that was planned under the ongoing Population and Health Project, but later fell victim to work&#13;
interruptions, would be completed. The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) minimum equipment for&#13;
19 CS and an initial stock of drugs for all the 73 public CS in the five provinces; (ii) completion of&#13;
the rehabilitation of two CS; (iii) a communications network; and (iv) a vehicle, some office&#13;
equipment, and a minimum operating budget for the five BPS, on a declining basis (70% during the&#13;
first three years and 50% thereafter). This would ensure the ability of the five BPS to carry out&#13;
minimum activities. More resources would be provided by MOPH, through counterpart funds from&#13;
aid from the European Union, as BPS' activities and staffing increase.&#13;
3.21         Rehabilitation of nine hospitals. The rehabilitation of nine hospitals is part of an&#13;
overall program to rehabilitate provincial and "secteur" hospitals supported by Belgium, the&#13;
European Union, France, Germany and IDA (Annex 6). This program was defined by MOPH&#13;
following its survey of hospitals in all 15 provinces, covering rehabilitation needs, the type of health&#13;
services supplied, and the required number of beds per capita, based on the epidemiological situation,&#13;
population covered, and volume of activities in each hospital. The selection of the nine hospitals to&#13;
be rehabilitated by the proposed project has been made on the basis of other donors' commitments.&#13;
Nine out of the 11 public hospitals in the five project provinces will be rehabilitated under the&#13;
project, and the remaining two by Belgium (one has already been rehabilitated). During project&#13;
preparation, MOPH defined in collaboration with donors the three levels of the health system (health&#13;
centers and two levels of referral) and the minimum package of services to be offered at each level&#13;
(Annex 9). The rehabilitation and equipment needs of the nine project hospitals were defined on this&#13;
basis. The project would rehabilitate the following hospitals (Annex 10): (i) two second-referral&#13;
hospitals in Bururi and Ngozi; (ii) five first-referral hospitals in Kayanza, Muramvya, Muyinga,&#13;
Rumonge, and Musema, where services offered vary somewhat on the basis of differences in the&#13;
volume of their activities; and (iii) two first-referral hospitals, Ibuye and Matana, where the number&#13;
of beds was reduced because of low occupancy rates and the proximity of other hospitals. The&#13;
project would only increase the total hospital bed capacity by 39 beds, or 4%.&#13;
3.22         During the reappraisal mission, it was agreed that MOPH would conduct a study of&#13;
the nine project hospitals in 1995 to refine needs on the basis of the new (post-crisis) situation. This&#13;
study will assess: (i) the current status of the hospitals with respect to population covered, medical&#13;
personnel on the job, and type and volume of services offered; (ii) personnel needs, taking into&#13;
account the revised MOPH personnel norms and the hospitals' potential volume of activities; (iii)&#13;
training requirements; (iv) revised equipment needs (specifications and quantity), based on volume of&#13;
activity and the availability and qualifications of personnel; and (v) a possible redefinition of the&#13;
areas planned for certain services, especially consulting rooms and laboratories. This study might&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
lead to a rescheduling of equipment supply based on having sufficient staff to operate it in place&#13;
(heavy hospital equipment might be supplied later in the project).&#13;
3.23          The hospitals would be rehabilitated in three phases, at the rate of three hospitals per&#13;
phase, because of constraints related to the capacity of the construction sector and the adequacy of&#13;
staffing. However, a minimum amount of equipment would be supplied to all nine hospitals during&#13;
the first rehabilitation phase, to enable them to resume certain activities. Such support would be&#13;
determined by the evaluation study (para. 3.22). During negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that, not later than six months after the rehabilitation of each project hospital, it would:&#13;
(i) introduce standardized management accounting systems and training programs in hospital&#13;
management there; and (ii) assign personnel to it, as recommended by a study of the project&#13;
hospitals (para. 7.2(d)).&#13;
3.24          The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) rehabilitation, construction work, furniture,&#13;
equipment and vehicles for three hospitals through the proposed credit (in Bururi, Ibuye and&#13;
Matana); similar expenditures would be cofinanced by KfW for the remaining six hospitals&#13;
(Kayanza, Muramvya, Musema, Muyinga, Ngozi, and Rumonge); and (ii) an initial stock of drugs&#13;
and management tools for the nine hospitals. Project funding would also finance recurrent costs&#13;
generated by the investments, including: (a) operation and maintenance of vehicles; and (b)&#13;
maintenance of medical equipment in the nine hospitals and six additional hospitals which are not&#13;
supported by external aid projects. These costs would be financed on a declining basis (70% during&#13;
the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter). Additional recurrent costs to be&#13;
incurred after project completion were determined to be within the limits of the hospitals' financing&#13;
capacity (para. 4.6). Activities linked to the strengthening of service delivery would be supervised by&#13;
the General Directorate for Health, in cooperation with the Directorate for Health Logistics.&#13;
Component 3: Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (MCH/FP)&#13;
Total Cost: US$4 million&#13;
IDA Contribution: US$3.9 million&#13;
3.25          The general objective of this component is to assist MOPH in implementing its 1993&#13;
Medium-Term Family Planning Program (para 1.30). Specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen the&#13;
Bureau of Coordination of the Family Planning Program (CPPF) and the family planning capabilities&#13;
of the BPS; (ii) improve the quality of MCH/FP services in health facilities nationwide; and (iii)&#13;
change public attitudes about family size and the use of modem contraceptives. The proposed&#13;
project is expected to contribute to increasing the MCPR from the present 1.6% to 10% in the year&#13;
2000 (Annex 8). Such a target may appear optimistic but could well be within Burundi's reach, as&#13;
the needed institutional structures to provide family planning services are mostly in place, albeit in&#13;
need of some reinforcement. Consequently, if IEC activities promoting contraceptive behaviors are&#13;
successful and the clinical and interpersonal communications retraining programs for health&#13;
personnel are carried out early in the project, as planned, prevalence could indeed increase more&#13;
rapidly than in other countries with low prevalence. IEC activities are thus critical to family&#13;
planning and population control, albeit rendered even more difficult to design and implement in the&#13;
context of the present crisis. Preparation activities such as research and training, setting up an&#13;
information and monitoring system, and preparing standards and norms for FP and all health services&#13;
will be financed in 1995 by a Japanese PHRD grant that supported the preparation of this project&#13;
component. Project activities for this component were identified in light of the above and other&#13;
donors' interventions (Annex 4).&#13;

3.26          Institutional strengthening.  Institutional structures to implement the Medium-&#13;
Term Family Planning Program are in place, but need strengthening. At the central level, CPPF,&#13;
which is responsible for implementing the program, has hired the needed staff as determined during&#13;
project preparation. Skills improvement is essential, however, especially in the areas of management&#13;
and IEC. At the provincial level, medical directors also need training in management as well as&#13;
epidemiology and statistics, to monitor maternal and child health and family planning activities.&#13;
3.27          The proposed project would finance: (a) at the central level:  (i) short-term&#13;
management training courses and a fellowship for a Master's degree in public health; (ii) short-term&#13;
international technical assistance to improve the communications skills of CPPF personnel; and (iii)&#13;
an office facility for CPPF's headquarters; and (b) at the provincial level: (i) short-term training in&#13;
epidemiology and statistics and in management of health programs; (ii) international technical&#13;
assistance to organize a course in epidemiology and statistics; and (iii) purchase of computers for&#13;
provinces receiving no support from other donors.&#13;
3.28          Improvement of health and family planning services. Lessons learned in other&#13;
Sub-Saharan countries show that the quality of services -- reflecting the medical competencies of&#13;
health personnel, availability of drugs and contraceptives, health personnel attitudes towards patients&#13;
and their ability to listen and counsel -- influences the level of use of health and family planning&#13;
services. The beneficiary assessment conducted during project preparation attested to the public's&#13;
desire, in Burundi, for improved health services. Improvement is particularly critical for family&#13;
planning services, where negative attitudes of health personnel towards family planning and modem&#13;
contraceptives often interfere with service delivery and discourage potential users. The project&#13;
would provide support in four areas: (i) improvement of the medical knowledge and clinical skills of&#13;
new physicians; (ii) retraining of health center personnel; (iii) provision of drugs for women and&#13;
children; and (iv) research. To improve physician services, the project would help the medical&#13;
school revise its course in obstetrics/gynecology and integrate FP into its third and fourth years'&#13;
program, and also finance evaluation of this reform. Until the new program is in place, the project&#13;
would support the training of graduating physicians in obstetrics and contraceptive technology as&#13;
well as treatment of high-risk pregnancies. Such training would also enable medical graduates to&#13;
develop interpersonal communications skills and better listen to and advise patients in the area of&#13;
family planning. In the health centers, the project would support similar retraining courses for&#13;
paramedical personnel (six courses a year for about 120 persons), to immediately begin enhancing&#13;
service provision to women in particular. The project would also supply iron for pregnant women&#13;
and anti-parasite drugs for children.  In addition, a small budget has been set aside to buy&#13;
contraceptives in the eventuality of interruptions in supplies (expected to be financed by UNFPA and&#13;
KfW). Finally, several qualitative and operational studies would be carried out to monitor family&#13;
planning and maternal health activities, study the feasibility of alternative distribution channels for&#13;
contraceptives (such as community-based distribution), and better understand beneficiary needs.&#13;
CPPF plans to subcontract some of these studies to NGOs.&#13;
3.29          The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) assistance to the medical school, including&#13;
local technical assistance to revise the curriculum and train graduating physicians, audiovisual and&#13;
medical equipment for such training, one month of foreign technical assistance, a computer and a&#13;
vehicle for use in supervising recently-trained physicians, and associated recurrent costs on a&#13;
3&#13;
Provincial IEC coordinators, who are also members of the provincial teams, will be trained in 1995&#13;
before credit effectiveness, by using funds from the Japanese PHRD grant, and will then be able to&#13;
assist the provincial team with communication training at the community level.&#13;

declining basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter); (ii)&#13;
retraining in obstetrics for staff of health centers; (iii) drugs for pregnant and breast-feeding women&#13;
and children (iron and anti-parasite drugs); (iv) purchase of contraceptives in the event of an&#13;
interruption in supplies; (v) operational research; and (vi) qualitative studies.&#13;
3.30          IEC activities.  The objective of this sub-component is to support CPPF in&#13;
implementing a family planning IEC strategy, as defined in the Medium-Term Family Planning&#13;
Program. IEC activities are expected to play an important role in changing Burundians' attitudes and&#13;
behavior; however, the presently inadequate skills of CPPF staff and health personnel must be&#13;
enhanced to help Burundi meet its challenges in this sector, particularly in the aftermath of the crisis.&#13;
IEC activities to promote family planning are included in this component because in Burundi, as in&#13;
many other countries, IEC activities are carried out by individual health programs; thus CPPF is&#13;
responsible for managing IEC activities related to family planning and population control, while the&#13;
Health Education Unit (HEU) "orchestrates" the IEC activities of the various programs at the&#13;
national level.&#13;
3.31          A multimedia approach, which has proven effective in many (including African)&#13;
countries, would be used. Lectures and debates, information sessions and workshops would be&#13;
organized, targeting women and men of reproductive age, and including both official and unofficial&#13;
community leaders whose support is crucial. Video films would target: (a) community leaders and&#13;
urban residents (shown on television and used in the provinces during the lectures and debates, etc.);&#13;
or (b) people living in rural areas (to be used to test the mobile strategy, as described below). Audio&#13;
productions and printed material would be distributed to the BPS, health center, and IEC extension&#13;
workers, to help improve interpersonal communications. Further, the project would provide CPPF&#13;
with the resources required to test a mobile system for informing and motivating people in the area of&#13;
family planning. Proposed operational research would aim to test new methods for motivating&#13;
women to use modern contraceptives; MOPH intends to subcontract some of these studies to NGOs&#13;
(such as the Burundi Family Welfare Association, or ABUBEF). In addition, modest qualitative&#13;
studies would be conducted every year in different regions to help better understand the obstacles to&#13;
changing public attitudes towards family size and contraceptive use. Such obstacles would be&#13;
identified during monitoring of family planning activities. The maternal and child health program&#13;
would also benefit from the results of studies conducted by the HEU in the context of the IEC&#13;
component. CPPF will work closely with HEU in planning and carrying out its own studies and&#13;
communication activities.&#13;
3.32          The proposedproject wouldfinance: (i) interpersonal communication activities and&#13;
production of audiovisual and printed materials; (ii) purchase of a vehicle to test a mobile audio-&#13;
visual strategy; (iii) local technical assistance; and (iv) qualitative studies and operational research.&#13;
The project would fund only a small percentage of recurrent costs, most of which are to be met by&#13;
UNFPA. This component would be managed by CPPF, and activities in support of the Medical&#13;
School would be managed by the Dean of that school, in cooperation with the CPPF director. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not later than six months after credit&#13;
effectiveness, it would recruit, in accordance with terms of reference and selection procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to help implement the family planning IEC strategy (para&#13;
7.2(b)).&#13;

Component 4: Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)&#13;
Total Cost: US$3.3 million&#13;
IDA Contribution: US$3.1 million&#13;
3.33          MOPH recognized several years ago the importance of IEC activities in supporting&#13;
public health programs, promoting beneficial health practices, and encouraging families to take&#13;
greater responsibility for their health. It therefore developed, under the ongoing Population and&#13;
Health Project, an IEC capacity at the central level, the Health Education Unit (HEU). The role of&#13;
HEU is to coordinate and plan IEC activities at the national level, control quality and provide&#13;
technical assistance to program-specific lEC units and to BPS, and manage IEC activities of health&#13;
programs that lack the resources needed to carry out their own communications activities. HEU also&#13;
has an IEC materials production capacity, which can be used by all the health programs. A victim of&#13;
its own success, HEU has in recent years been unable to meet the significant demand for its services.&#13;
The project would strengthen HEU and assist with the decentralization of IEC activities.&#13;
3.34          The IEC component was designed in the context of the national strategy for health&#13;
and family planning campaigns, developed with financing from a Japanese PHRD grant during&#13;
project preparation in 1993. Its objective is to reinforce MOPH's ability to coordinate IEC activities,&#13;
produce IEC materials and carry out communications activities at both the central and peripheral&#13;
levels, in support of its priority programs and reforms. To meet this objective, the proposed project&#13;
would support: (a) the strengthening of HEU's capabilities to better: (i) coordinate and plan IEC&#13;
activities at a national level; and (ii) assist health programs and BPS in implementing IEC activities,&#13;
while reinforcing IEC capacity at the community level; and (b) the following IEC activities: (i)&#13;
promotion of beneficial health practices, such as vaccination, breast-feeding, hygiene and safe sexual&#13;
practices; (ii) informnation campaigns to make community leaders and the population aware of sector&#13;
reforms to be implemented by MOPH; and (iii) activities for programs that lack sufficient resources.&#13;
3.35          Institutional Strengthening. To strengthen [EC capabilities at the central level, the&#13;
proposed project would seek to: (i) develop management, research and communication skills for&#13;
HEU's staff; and (ii) reinforce provincial communication and IEC training skills, by providing HEU&#13;
with logistical means to better supervise and assist the BPS agents. At the community level, training&#13;
of health center personnel and health extension workers in interpersonal communications and social&#13;
mobilization would increase their ability to motivate the population to adopt beneficial health&#13;
behaviors, including those related to contraception.&#13;
3.36          The proposedproject wouldfinance: (i) international long-term technical assistance&#13;
(two person/years) to strengthen HEU's capabilities; (ii) training in management of communications&#13;
programs; (iii) short-term national and international technical assistance to help implement specific&#13;
tasks (such as training and studies); (iv) logistical support at the central level and associated recurrent&#13;
costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50% thereafter); and (v) training in&#13;
interpersonal communications and social mobilization for health extension workers and staff in&#13;
health centers. The Government would recruit internationally a consultant specialized in mass&#13;
communications planning, with qualifications, experience and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
as a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 7.4(b)).&#13;
3.37          Support for IEC activities. Since most public health programs have a budget for&#13;
LEC activities, the proposed credit would be confined to financing these activities in two areas: (a)&#13;
support for sector reforms; and (b) campaigns to address priority health problems for which MOPH&#13;
has no alternative financing (for instance, bacillary dysentery) or insufficient funds (as may be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

case with HIV/AIDS/STD). Support would be given for IEC activities at the central, provincial and&#13;
community levels. At the central level, the project would support the production of appropriate IEC&#13;
materials, many of which would be distributed to IEC staff in the provinces and communities during&#13;
training workshops, refresher courses and supervision visits. The proposed project would finance:&#13;
(i) IEC materials for priority programs lacking adequate resources and for information/sensitization&#13;
campaigns to be conducted in parallel with the development of sector reforms; (ii) audiovisual and&#13;
desktop publishing equipment to enhance HEU's production capacities; and (iii) logistical support in&#13;
supervising IEC activities in the provinces and communes, and associated recurrent costs on a&#13;
declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50% thereafter).&#13;

IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.1           The project will be implemented over a five-year period. The total cost of the&#13;
project is estimated at FBu 9.05 billion (US$36.9 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$22.7 million. Base costs are estimated, in December 1994 prices, at US$30.5&#13;
million equivalent (excluding taxes of US$7.0 million and duties of US$2.0 million). Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US$2.0 million and price contingencies at US$4.4 million,&#13;
representing 7% and 15% of base costs respectively. The Government would exempt all imported&#13;
goods and services of customs duties and taxes. Local materials for health center rehabilitation and&#13;
for small purchases related to project operating costs will be taxed. Costs are based on actual&#13;
expenditures for goods and services provided by the PCT of the ongoing Population and Health&#13;
Project and from other donor-financed projects in the health sector.&#13;

4.2           Project costs by component are shown in Table I above. Institutional strengthening&#13;
accounts for 20% of total base cost; strengthening service delivery in five provinces for 54%; the&#13;
implementation of the MCH/FP policy for  11%; the IEC component for 9%; and project coordination&#13;
for 6%. Project costs by category of expenditure are shown in Annex 11: civil works account for&#13;
31% of total base costs; technical assistance, training and studies for 28%; furniture, equipment and&#13;
vehicles for 23%; operating expenditures for 10%; the social fund for 5%; and drugs for 3%.&#13;
4.3           Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10% for&#13;
civil works and 5% for equipment, vehicles, furniture, technical assistance, studies and recurrent&#13;
costs. Price contingencies have been calculated: (i) on foreign exchange expenditures, at 2.5% in&#13;
1996, 2.7% in 1997, and 2.5% during 1998-2000; and (ii) on local cost expenditures, at 10% in 1995&#13;
and 5% thereafter.&#13;

4.4           Recurrent Cost Implications. Incremental recurrent costs generated by the project&#13;
at completion are summarized in Table 2 below. They have been applied to three cost centers,&#13;
which will have to provide for their financing after project completion. The incremental recurrent&#13;
costs of MOPH's administrative levels (central and provincial) would amount to FBu 59.4 million,&#13;
including inflation, in 2001 (i.e., the first year after estimated project completion). This amount does&#13;
not include travel-related allowances for paramedicals working in insecure areas since it was&#13;
assumed that such allowances would no longer be necessary after project completion (as these areas&#13;
would have become secure). Incremental recurrent costs at the administrative levels would account&#13;
for 2.4% of the projected non-wage recurrent MOPH budget for the year 2001 (estimated to be&#13;
increased by 97% over its 1994 level). These should be absorbed by MOPH's budget. Institutional&#13;
arrangements for the financing and management of the social fund will be defined by the&#13;
Government in 1995 (para. 3.12). If MOPH becomes the authority responsible for those functions,&#13;
this incremental cost would account for 2.4% of MOPH's non-wage recurrent budget and could be&#13;
absorbed by MOPH's budget.&#13;

4.5           While the proposed investments in the nine project hospitals would not add greatly&#13;
to the existing need for recurrent resources, they would still require an increase in recurrent funding&#13;
because current requirements for maintenance are underfunded, and health facilities understaffed.&#13;
The net increase in in-patient capacity in the nine project hospitals would be only 39 beds, or 4%;&#13;
however, increased salary costs would arise during the life of the project, unrelated to its&#13;
implementation but attributable to the existing, acute shortage and consequent need for increased&#13;
staffing via redeployment and new recruitment. With regard to non-wage expenditures, quality&#13;
improvements made possible by the project would result in a greater demand for drugs and other&#13;
consumable, but these costs are expected to be fully financed by CAM and user fee proceeds.&#13;
4.6          In contrast, recurrent resource needs for vehicles and equipment maintenance would&#13;
increase as a consequence of the project. Because current spending for maintenance is so low, a&#13;
figure of 5% of equipment costs per year was chosen to provide a realistic amount that project&#13;
hospitals could absorb. This amount should be sufficient to cover the costs of contracts with the&#13;
three existing regional maintenance units for regular preventive and corrective maintenance. In&#13;
addition, the project would finance the maintenance cost of existing equipment for the six public&#13;
hospitals which would not be supported by other donors' interventions. At project completion, the&#13;

Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                                              29&#13;
total annual incremental recurrent costs for vehicle and equipment maintenance would amount to&#13;
FBu 80 million (including inflation) for the 15 hospitals. These funding requirements could be&#13;
absorbed by the hospitals' own resources, which would include MOPH budgetary allocations and&#13;
proceeds from the CAM and user fees.&#13;
4.7              Sustainability.  The Government's reform  of sector financing would address the&#13;
issue of sustainability of health services and programs. The cost of health services, programs and&#13;
administration would be assessed at all levels of the health care system, and the new financing&#13;
mechanisms to be established would seek to allocate adequate funding to health services, based on&#13;
rational criteria. Improved management at all levels of the health system (e.g., better allocation of&#13;
resources, improved hospital management, rationalization of drug supply) and the improved&#13;
performance of cost-sharing mechanisms (CAM) and user fees would help MOPH to allocate more&#13;
resources to priority health programs. However, given the low level of national expenditures in the&#13;
health sector, external financing will still be needed to help meet total financing needs of the sector.&#13;
Reforms developed in the context of the project will lead to sustainable interventions in the long-&#13;
term.&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
4.8              Of the total project costs of US$36.9 million, IDA would finance US$21.3 million&#13;
(58% of total project costs), KfW would provide a grant of US$13.6 million (37%) and the&#13;
Government of Burundi would fund US$2.05 million (5%).&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION AND READINESS&#13;
5.1          The proposed project was identified in February 1991. Project preparation was&#13;
carried out with financial support from the ongoing Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI) and&#13;
a Japanese PHRD Grant. A beneficiary assessment was carried out during project preparation to&#13;
determine beneficiaries' satisfaction with Burundi's public health services, including the pre-&#13;
payment health card (CAM). Appraisal took place in May 1993 and post-appraisal in September&#13;
1993. Project negotiations were scheduled to be completed by end-1993 but could not take place&#13;
because of the October 1993 events. The establishment of a new Government in September 1994&#13;
made possible a re-appraisal mission in November/December 1994. The content of the project was&#13;
redefined on the basis of MOPH's new priorities and other donor interventions; main donors&#13;
participated in the re-appraisal of the project. Some project activities were maintained and redefined,&#13;
such as: improvement of sector financing, introduction of management autonomy for hospitals,&#13;
hospital rehabilitation, and implementation of the IEC policy. New activities have been added,&#13;
including: development and management of human resources, quality management and assessment,&#13;
and implementation of the MCH/FP policy. During the re-appraisal mission, it was agreed with&#13;
MOPH that activities aimed at establishing an autonomous drug procurement unit would not be&#13;
financed through the proposed project, given European Union commitment to their financing. Since&#13;
the on-going Population and Health Project will be closing on June 30, 1995, the Government&#13;
requested a PPF totaling US$670,000 to continue preparatory activities so that project activities are&#13;
ready to start by the time the proposed credit becomes effective. The following activities are in the&#13;
process of being completed: (a) action plans for implementing sector reforms to be supported by the&#13;
proposed project have been prepared; (b) architectural designs and tender documents for hospital&#13;
rehabilitation have been finalized; and (c) lists of equipment, furniture and vehicles are being&#13;
finalized. The details of equipment needs (including specifications and quantities) for the 19 health&#13;
centers and nine hospitals to be supported by the proposed project would be reassessed based on new&#13;
priorities and staffing constraints, through an evaluation study scheduled to be done before credit&#13;
effectiveness; detailed terms of reference for this study have already been prepared. This study&#13;
would not lead to an increase in cost estimates but to a rescheduling of equipment supply (para.&#13;
3.22).&#13;
B. MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
5.2          The MOPH would have overall responsibility for project implementation. All&#13;
project activities would be managed and implemented by existing units or directorates within&#13;
MOPH, as follows: (i) activities related to human resource development and management would be&#13;
managed by the Directorate for Health Services, in cooperation with DGS for training activities; (ii)&#13;
the introduction of management autonomy for public hospitals would be managed and supervised by&#13;
the IGS (Inspection Generale de la Sante), in cooperation with the DGS for training activities; (iii)&#13;
all activities linked to improving health financing mechanisms would be managed by the Unit in&#13;
charge of Planning and Coordination of Studies, Program and Budget; (iv) activities related to&#13;
quality assessment and management would be carried out by the IGS; (v) implementation of the&#13;
maintenance strategy would be supervised by the Directorate for Health Logistics; (vi) all project&#13;
activities related to the strengthening of service delivery in five provinces would be managed by the&#13;
DGS, in cooperation with the Directorate for Health Logistics; (vii) maternal and child health and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        31&#13;
family planning activities would be managed by CPPF; and (viii) IEC activities would be managed&#13;
by the Health Education Unit (HEU) of MOPH.&#13;
5.3           A Project Coordination Team (PCT), similar to that in place under the Population&#13;
and Health Project, would be set up, completely integrated into MOPH. As is the case for all donor-&#13;
financed projects in Burundi, the PCT would report to the Minister's adviser in charge of the&#13;
Planning Unit. The team would be responsible for day-to-day coordination of project activities,&#13;
administrative and financial management, as well as monitoring and evaluation. In particular, the&#13;
PCT would: (i) ensure that annual work programs and budgets are prepared by each directorate in&#13;
charge of its respective component, and review their implementation progress reports; (ii) procure&#13;
goods and services and recruit consultants when needed; (iii) maintain and consolidate all project&#13;
accounts including the IDA Special Account and the project account; (iv) prepare the necessary&#13;
documents for withdrawal of proceeds from the IDA credit; (v) make arrangements for annual audits;&#13;
(vi) prepare, as required, semi-annual and annual progress reports for IDA, the Government and&#13;
other co-financiers; (vii) put in place a monitoring system for the project's performance indicators&#13;
and for the progress of implementation; and (viii) organize annual and mid-term reviews of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.4           The PCT would be headed by a project coordinator, assisted by the other key staff&#13;
(an economist, an architect, an accountant, and a procurement specialist), as well as by the necessary&#13;
support staff and short term consultants to be hired for specific tasks. Team members would be&#13;
recruited through a competitive process, under one-year renewable contracts. A consultant (architect)&#13;
would be contracted internationally by KfW to assist the PCT in the project's civil works aspects&#13;
(architectural studies, control and supervision of works). During negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that the project coordinator and the key staff of the project coordination team would be&#13;
maintained at all times according to terms of reference and selection procedures acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para. 7.2(e)). The Government has, as a condition of Board presentation, initiated the recruitment&#13;
of a project coordinator, by submitting proof that the position has been advertised locally, with terms&#13;
of reference and selection criteria acceptable to IDA (para. 7.3(b)). It also agreed that it would, as a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness, recruit all key staff of the project coordination team with&#13;
qualifications, experience, terms of reference and selection criteria satisfactory to IDA (para&#13;
7.4(c)).&#13;
5.5          Implementation Schedule. The project would be implemented over the five-year&#13;
period January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2000. The overall project implementation schedule (Annex&#13;
12) provides the basis for preparing the final work program, budget and procurement schedule for the&#13;
first year of project implementation. During each joint annual review of project implementation, the&#13;
implementation schedule would be reviewed and updated, finalizing implementation plans for the&#13;
following year.&#13;
5.6          Implementation Manual.  The Implementation Manual would include the&#13;
following information and documents: (i) objectives and description of the project; (ii) detailed costs&#13;
by component; (iii) implementation arrangements (including monitoring of progress) and a time-&#13;
bound detailed implementation plan; (iv) procurement schedule; (v) sample documents for&#13;
procurement and disbursement; (vi) terms of reference for technical assistance and training&#13;
programs; (vii) key indicators and arrangements for collecting and monitoring them; and (viii)&#13;
standard progress report formats. The implementation manual will be finished prior to credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;

C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.7          Monitoring and annual evaluation of project performance would be the responsibility&#13;
of the MOPH directorates and units implementing project activities, and would be coordinated by&#13;
the PCT. Key project performance indicators, to monitor progress towards project development&#13;
objectives and implementation progress, were reviewed and agreed upon during the re-appraisal&#13;
mission (Annex 8). The targets to be reached are initial estimates, and would be carefully reviewed&#13;
and, if necessary, revised on the basis of evaluation studies to be carried out under the proposed&#13;
project. These indicators would be monitored in close collaboration with IDA.&#13;
To effectively coordinate project monitoring, during negotiations, the Government gave assurances&#13;
that: (i) progress reports on project implementation and outcomes would be transmitted to IDA twice&#13;
a year (in April and October), starting in April 1996, (ii) a joint IDA/Government review of&#13;
implementation of both the project and Government sector strategies, based on progress reports,&#13;
annual work programs, procurement schedule and budgets for the next year would be organized, not&#13;
later than October 31 of each year, starting in 1996; and (iii) a mid-term review of implementation&#13;
of both the project and Government sector strategies would be carried out jointly with IDA, not later&#13;
than June 30, 1998 (para. 7.2(W)).&#13;
5.8          The mid-term review would evaluate progress accomplished toward objectives for&#13;
each project component and for Government sector strategies, and making use of the audit reports. If&#13;
required, the project would be modified based on the findings and recommendations of the mid-term&#13;
review. The evaluation would verify if: (a) key objectives are being achieved, including the&#13;
attainment of project performance indicators; (b) the project needs to be adjusted in accordance with&#13;
the implementation experience; (c) the terms of reference of the technical assistance have been&#13;
respected, especially regarding skill transfers; (d) services are delivered adequately at health&#13;
facilities within the project area; (e) counterpart funds are available; (f) the staffing of the PCT is&#13;
adequate for satisfactory implementation and in particular, whether the project coordinator is&#13;
sufficiently experienced and qualified and performing adequately; (g) the system of granting travel-&#13;
related allowances to paramedicals willing to work in insecure areas has been effective; and (h)&#13;
progress has been achieved in: (i) ensuring that proceeds from the CAM and user fees are managed&#13;
transparently by the health sector; (ii) improving the availability and affordability of drugs; (iii)&#13;
increasing the price of the CAM and user fees in accordance with recommendations made in the&#13;
context of the project; (iv) ensuring that the CAM gives access to health services provided by the&#13;
private non-profit sector; and (v) setting up mechanisms to provide for partial or total exemption&#13;
from the CAM for indigent people. The mid-term review would also if necessary revise financing&#13;
scenarios for the remaining period of the project. The Government would submit to IDA, at least 45&#13;
days before the mid-term review, a report describing the status of the items listed above and of&#13;
project implementation in general, in scope and detail satisfactory to IDA. Based on the mid-term&#13;
review, the Government will prepare an action plan acceptable to IDA for the further implementation&#13;
of the project and sector strategies. The Government would also prepare and submit to IDA, within&#13;
six months after the closing date of the project, a project completion report as well as a plan for the&#13;
future implementation of the project. A detailed plan of IDA's supervision missions and the annual&#13;
and mid-term reviews is provided in Annex 13.&#13;

D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4&#13;
5.9          Table 4 below summarizes procurement arrangements for project elements, by&#13;
category. No special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in credit documents for&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB), as Burundi's procurement practices allow IDA procedures&#13;
to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. It was agreed that the&#13;
Government would, as a condition of credit effectiveness, ensure that all bid documents for the first&#13;
year of project implementation after the effective date are prepared and satisfactory to IDA (para&#13;
7.4(d)). During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the procurement procedures and&#13;
arrangements, standard bidding documents, and standard processing times for key procurement&#13;
activities agreed upon at negotiations would be applied throughout the duration of the project (para.&#13;
7.2 (g)). Procurement schedules and packaging of works, goods and consulting services are&#13;
presented in the implementation schedule in Annex 12.&#13;
5.10         Civil Works.  Civil works contracts for the rehabilitation of (three) hospitals&#13;
(US$1.95 million), and for the construction of offices for the CPPF and PCT (US$0.49 million),&#13;
will be grouped into bid packages of US$300,000 or more and awarded on the basis of ICB, in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January&#13;
1995). Eligible domestic contractors would be allowed a preferential margin of 7.5%. Standard&#13;
bidding documents developed by the Bank would be used. Civil works for the rehabilitation of the&#13;
six remaining hospitals will be cofinanced in parallel by KfW under its own procurement&#13;
arrangements. Civil works contracts for the completion of two health centers (the construction of&#13;
which was initiated under the ongoing IDA-supported Population and Health Project), each estimated&#13;
to cost less than the threshold of US$300,000 and aggregating to US$0.32 million, would be&#13;
procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). The following procedures would be applied&#13;
for NCB: (i) tenders would be advertised locally; (ii) bidders would be given a minimum of 30 days&#13;
for submitting bids; (iii) evaluation criteria would be specified in the bidding documents in precise&#13;
quantitative/monetary terms; (iv) all bids would be opened in public, with bidders' representatives&#13;
permitted to attend; (v) the award will be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; and (vi)&#13;
eligible foreign contractors would be allowed to bid. Civil works for health centers (CS) and&#13;
provincial health bureaus (BPS) (US$0.03 million) in the five provinces supported by the proposed&#13;
project, including very minor rehabilitation works, will be carried out under force account.&#13;
5.11          Goods. It was agreed with KfW that major hospital equipment would be: (i)&#13;
procured under standardized methods for all of the nine project hospitals, in accordance with Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines; and (ii) jointly financed by KfW and IDA. Therefore, major hospital&#13;
equipment (US$1.73 million financed by IDA and US$2.59 million financed by Kf*"), and office,&#13;
audio-visual and similar equipment for IEC activities, vehicles and drugs (for a total amount of&#13;
US$3.83 million financed by IDA) would be grouped into bid packages of at least US$100,000 and&#13;
procured through ICB, in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines (January 1995). Domestic&#13;
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% over the c.i.f. price, or the existing&#13;
applicable rate of import duties, whichever is lower. Office and hospitalfurniture would be procured&#13;
through NCB under contracts in an aggregate amount not exceeding US$0.05 million. Procedures&#13;
4&#13;
Under local competitive bidding and shopping procedures, the term "local" has the same meaning as&#13;
the term "national" as defined in the January 1995 revised Bank Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.&#13;
&#13;

34                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
for NCB would be reviewed by IDA and would include local advertising, public bid opening, and&#13;
clear evaluation criteria; the award would be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.&#13;
Foreign bidders would not be precluded from participating. Items, or groups of items, of small&#13;
hospital equipment that cannot be grouped, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$30,000&#13;
per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$0.08 million, would be purchased on the basis of price&#13;
quotations from at least three eligible suppliers in accordance with the international and local&#13;
shopping procedures acceptable to IDA, or would be procured through UN procurement agencies, in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
5.12         Technical Assistance and studies.  Technical assistance (US$5.7 million) and&#13;
studies (US$3.0 million) would be procured in accordance with Bank's guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). Technical assistance requirements for the proposed project are described&#13;
in Annex 14. Technical assistance would include: (i) 88 person/months of support for policy&#13;
decisions; (ii) 862 person/months of support for project implementation, including 576&#13;
person/months of foreign physicians to provide emergency medical assistance in the nine project&#13;
hospitals; and (iii) 383 person/months of support for capacity building. Studies are primarily related&#13;
to the production of films, video and printed materials for the IEC activities.&#13;
5.13         Training. Annual training programs, including course content, duration and number&#13;
of beneficiaries, and budgetary estimates would be submitted to IDA for approval before training is&#13;
initiated. Local training per diems would be paid in accordance with UNDP local scales.  A&#13;
summary of training (US$1.19 million) is in Annex 15.&#13;

5.14         Review of Procurement. Civil works and goods contracts above US$100,000 will&#13;
be subject to prior IDA review, which will cover 90% of IDA-financed procurement. Selected post-&#13;
review of awarded contracts below the threshold would be applied to about one in five contracts. In&#13;
the case of consultants, prior review by IDA would be required for all consultancy contracts for&#13;
individuals above US$50,000 and for firms above US$100,000. However, this exception would not&#13;
apply to terms of reference, single source contracts, assignments of a critical nature (as determined&#13;
by IDA) and contract amendments that raise the contract value for individuals and firms to&#13;
US$50,000 and US$100,000 respectively. Prior IDA review will apply to: terms of reference, short&#13;
lists, letters of invitation with selection criteria, CVs, evaluation reports, and contracts and letters of&#13;
appointment for consultants. Standard bidding documents for procurement of civil works and goods,&#13;
that were developed during the ongoing Population and Health Project, are ready to be used for ICB&#13;
and NCB procurement under the proposed project. The Bank's revised standard bidding documents&#13;
for goods and works will be used during project implementation. The Government with IDA's&#13;
assistance will organize a project launch workshop around the time of credit effectiveness, and will&#13;
finalize an implementation manual including reviewing IDA's standard bidding documents for goods&#13;
and works and IDA's standard letters of invitation for consultants, for use by the PCT throughout&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
5.15         Recording of Procurement Information.  Procurement information would be&#13;
collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of contract information by the borrower;&#13;
(b)    comprehensive semi-annual reports to IDA by the Borrower, indicating: (i) cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts, to be revised semi-annually for the total project,&#13;
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii)&#13;
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate&#13;
limits on specified methods of procurement; and (iv) consultant performance;&#13;
(c)    during supervision missions, a detailed statement of all procurement undertaken to&#13;
date, together with a forecast of procurement anticipated to be undertaken in the&#13;
coming six months, with estimated costs; and&#13;
(d)    procurement information provided as part of an implementation completion report&#13;
by the Government within six months of the credit closing date.&#13;
5.16         Procurement management. The PCT will be responsible for preparing bidding&#13;
documents and maintaining the deadlines for procurement actions agreed upon in the procurement&#13;
schedule. A consultant architect, financed by KfW, will be part of the PCT and will assist national&#13;
consultants in the preparation and review of bidding documents and in the control and supervision of&#13;
all civil works. In addition, an experienced procurement specialist will be hired within the PCT to&#13;
prepare all bidding documents and follow up on all activities related to procurement.&#13;

E. DISBURSEMENT, ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
5.17            The proposed IDA credit of SDR 14.3 million (US$21.3 million) will be disbursed in&#13;
accordance with Table 5 below.&#13;

Total                         21.3&#13;
5.18            Expenditures for major hospital equipment not financed by IDA will be financed by&#13;
KfW (60% of the total). Incremental operating expenditures include (for all project components): (i)&#13;
operation of vehicles and equipment; (ii) maintenance of vehicles, equipment and office facilities;&#13;
(iii) rental of office space; (iv) travel costs and travel-related allowances; and (v) office&#13;
administration and communication. These expenditures will be financed by IDA at 70% until June&#13;
30, 1998, and at 50% thereafter.&#13;
5.19            It is expected that the project would be completed by December 31, 2000 and the&#13;
credit closing date would be June 30, 2001. Disbursements for the proposed project have been&#13;
projected to go faster than the standard profile for Burundi (all sectors included), and that for the&#13;
population, health and nutrition sector in Africa. The reasons are the following: (i) disbursements&#13;
under the Population and Health Project have taken 7.5 years, but would have taken only 6.5 years&#13;
(about 15% less than the standard profile for Burundi) absent the 1993 October events; (ii) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                             Burundi: Second Health and Population Project&#13;
proposed credit will finance few civil works, so the usual delays caused by major rehabilitation in the&#13;
past are not anticipated; and (iii) most of the IDA financing will support sector reforms that would be&#13;
implemented by MOPH within the first two years of project implementation. The estimated&#13;
quarterly schedule of disbursements is presented in Annex 16.  All disbursements will be&#13;
documented by the PCT in a manner acceptable to IDA. Disbursements under contracts for goods&#13;
and services or single purchases of up to US$100,000 for works and goods (including drugs), and&#13;
US$100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants and all operating&#13;
expenditures shall be submitted against statements of expenditure (SOEs). The SOEs and all records&#13;
such as contracts, orders, invoices, and payroll vouchers would be retained by the PCT, which would&#13;
be responsible for monitoring disbursements, compiling and maintaining financial information and&#13;
ensuring that the annual audit is undertaken in a timely fashion. The PCT would be the primary&#13;
liaison between IDA and the Government for all issues pertaining to disbursements under the project.&#13;
5.20         Special Account and Project Account. To ensure that funds for this project are&#13;
readily available and to facilitate disbursements, MOPH will open a special account in US dollars in&#13;
the BRB ("Banque de la Republique du Burundi"), on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. An&#13;
initial deposit in the special account of US$400,000 will be advanced from the IDA credit to cover&#13;
three months of anticipated operating expenditures; once the total of disbursements and outstanding&#13;
special commitments reach US$1,000,000, this amount could be increased up to US$800,000. The&#13;
PCT's accountant would be responsible for managing the special account and would maintain all&#13;
documentation pertinent to it. The accountant would also be charged with preparing and submitting&#13;
applications for the replenishment of this account, which would be replenished monthly, or sooner if&#13;
required. Payment requests above a threshold of US$80,000 (20% of the initial deposit amount) may&#13;
be submitted under the direct payment procedure. This ceiling would increase to US$160,000 once&#13;
the entire initial deposit has been advanced. The Government would also open in the BRB a project&#13;
account to cover three months of Government contributions to operating costs, which would be&#13;
replenished quarterly. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, as a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness, a project account would be opened in the BRB, with an initial deposit of&#13;
US$80, 000 equivalent (para. 7.4(e)).&#13;
5.21         Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The PCT would&#13;
establish and maintain project-related accounts and would be responsible for compiling and&#13;
consolidating the necessary accounting documents. The accountant in the PCT would be the primary&#13;
liaison between the Government and the Bank on all accounting/financial management related&#13;
matters.  Accounts shall be maintained in accordance with sound principles of accounting&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The computerized project accounting system should be capable of producing,&#13;
on a timely basis, information needed by management to plan, evaluate and control use of, and&#13;
accountability for, project resources. This should include the regular production of financing&#13;
schedules for loans and credits, showing funds utilized, committed and available by both category of&#13;
expenditure and project component, in the currency of the respective agreement. It should also&#13;
include information to enable management to compare costs with appraisal estimates for cost control&#13;
purposes. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government would ensure that an accounting&#13;
and financial management system for project implementation is in place, satisfactory to IDA (para.&#13;
7.4(j)).&#13;
5.22         The PCT would provide IDA with semi-annual and annual financial statements to&#13;
reflect the financial performance of the project. An auditor's opinion and a report satisfactory to IDA&#13;
on such statements will be provided annually within six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
Should IDA decide that the Special Account should be audited more frequently, a semi-annual audit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                     39&#13;
will be requested. The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting&#13;
system and on internal controls, separate opinions on the special account and on the reliability of&#13;
SOEs as a basis for loan disbursements, compliance with financial covenants, and a management&#13;
letter. The auditor's report will be sent simultaneously to the Government and to IDA. The&#13;
foregoing accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and&#13;
timely information to IDA for supervision of the project. Terms of reference for the auditor have&#13;
already been agreed under the ongoing project. During negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that: (i) an annual audit of project accounts would be submitted to IDA within six&#13;
months following the end of the Government's fiscal year (para. 7.2(h)); and a semi-annual audit of&#13;
the special account would be conducted if IDA determines a more frequent need to audit this account&#13;
(para. 7.2(h)).&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
5.23         The long-term impact on mortality rates and the possible decline in the rate of&#13;
population growth would have a positive impact on the environment. Hospital rehabilitation&#13;
activities would take account of environmental considerations. Improved maintenance and hygiene&#13;
of hospitals and their surroundings would also have a positive impact on the environment. Other&#13;
project components are not likely to have a negative environmental impact.&#13;

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1          The rehabilitation of health services and the implementation of key sector reforms&#13;
with regard to health personnel, health financing and hospital management would contribute to&#13;
improving the overall quality of health services in Burundi, while making them more accessible to&#13;
the poor, at an affordable cost. The project is therefore expected to help reduce the country's&#13;
mortality and morbidity rates. In addition, the successful implementation of the family planning&#13;
policy and IEC activities would help Burundi reduce its population growth rate and promote&#13;
beneficial health behaviors among the population. The project would have the following expected&#13;
benefits: (i) quality of health services in the project area would be judged satisfactory by 60% of the&#13;
beneficiaries surveyed at the end of the project; (ii) efficiency of the health care delivery system&#13;
would increase; (iii) management autonomy would have been introduced in all public hospitals, with&#13;
management systems and skills strengthened; (iv) overall sector financing would increase; (v)&#13;
modem contraceptive prevalence would increase from 1.6% now to 10% by the year 2000; and (vi)&#13;
IEC programs would contribute to more efficient use of health services and greater health coverage.&#13;
Using the letter of sector policy as a monitoring tool, the project would also assess annual progress&#13;
made in the implementation of complementary reforms that would be accomplished with other&#13;
donors' support, such as decentralization and strengthening of the health administration and&#13;
improvement of drug availability, management and use.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
6.2          This is a project with above-average risk. The main risk relates to the country's&#13;
unstable political situation; to address this risk, the project has been designed in a flexible manner,&#13;
so that some components could be implemented even during a crisis and the project's intended&#13;
benefits could be safeguarded; for example, hospital rehabilitation, implementation of MCH/FP and&#13;
IEC activities, and strengthening of hospital management autonomy could be implemented first in&#13;
the safest provinces. However, implementation of some sector reforms (particularly health financing&#13;
and staff redeployment) could be delayed, since they involve political decisions and actions that may&#13;
not be feasible in a crisis situation. In case of a continuous crisis, the project would be restructured&#13;
substantially as needed during the mid-term review. Other risks relate to (ii) the population's&#13;
response to MOPH's reforms; to address this risk, a beneficiary assessment has been conducted and&#13;
the results used during project preparation; similar assessments and quality surveys would be carried&#13;
out throughout project implementation; (iii) the institutional weaknesses of MOPH,' to address this&#13;
risk, project support would include strong capacity-building activities in areas where MOPH lacks&#13;
expertise; project implementation would be divided among different directorates within MOPH,&#13;
while PCT procurement and financial functions would be strengthened; and the project conditions&#13;
would enable close monitoring of project implementation and development performance; (iv) the&#13;
weak human resource base, especially the lack of qualified health personnel; to address this risk, the&#13;
project would help MOPH reduce the overall deficiency of personnel, in terms of both quantity and&#13;
quality; and (v) insufficient MOPH funding, which may jeopardize the improvement of health&#13;
services; to address this risk, Government agreed at negotiations that its proposals for health sector&#13;
investments and budgetary allocations would be reviewed by IDA annually and that the draft budget&#13;
would incorporate IDA's comments before its approval by the Council of Ministers.&#13;

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1          Before negotiations, the Government has:&#13;
(a)    Submitted a draft sector policy letter describing the content of the strategies that it&#13;
intends to develop (para. 2.2).&#13;
7.2          During negotiations, the Government gave the following assurances:&#13;
(a)   (i) not later than December 31, 1995, it would prepare a policy framework, draft&#13;
regulations and by-laws for autonomous public hospitals, based on an audit of the six&#13;
presently autonomous public hospitals; (ii) not later than March 31, 1996, it would&#13;
adopt a policy framework, satisfactory to IDA, including a timetable for&#13;
implementation; (iii) not later than June 30, 1996, it would cause each existing&#13;
autonomous public hospital to adopt the new regulations and by-laws; and (iv)&#13;
thereafter, it would cause each new autonomous public hospital to adopt the&#13;
regulations and by-laws within three months of its autonomy(para. 3.8);&#13;
(b)    Not later than six months after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to&#13;
terms of reference and selection procedures acceptable to IDA, the following local&#13;

LES GRANDES ORIENTATIONS DE LA POLITIQUE SECTORIELLE DE DEVELOPPEMENT&#13;
SANITAIRE&#13;
A. PLACE DE LA SANTE DANS LA POLITIQUE GENERALE DU PAYS&#13;
1.     L'objectif poursuivi par le Gouvemement A travers la politique sociale est d'amdliorer les&#13;
conditions socio-economiques de toutes les couches de la population. A ce titre, il continuera de veiller au&#13;
renforcement de la qualite et la disponibilite des services offerts A la population et s'attellera autant que&#13;
possible A limiter les eventuels effets negatifs que certaines mesures du Programme d'Ajustement&#13;
Structurel sont susceptibles de generer de facon directe sur le bien-etre des diverses catdgories.&#13;
2.     Le fondement philosophique de la politique sectorielle de la sante s'inspire de la Constitution de la&#13;
Republique du Burundi et est axe sur les attributs non derogeables que sont: 1'equite ou egalite de tous, la&#13;
justice sociale, le respect de la vie et de la personne humaine, le respect de l'ethique et de la deontologie&#13;
medicale et pharmaceutique.&#13;
3.     La base de cette politique reste le principe d'une medecine communautaire visant la plus large&#13;
promotion de la sante et la plus grande couverture sanitaire, F'am6lioration de l'etat de santd et de la qualite&#13;
de la vie des populations permettant A chacun de mener une vie saine et productive. Pour ce faire, les&#13;
strategies mises en oeuvre doivent s'appuyer sur une approche multisectorielle basee sur le renforcement&#13;
des soins de sante primaires.&#13;
4.      La santd n'a pas de prix, dit-on, mais elle a un codt. Le Gouvemement s'engage A consentir des&#13;
efforts visant A l'amelioration de la qualite et la disponibilite des services a court teme et A maintenir le&#13;
niveau reel des ressources allou6es A la santd A moyen terme. De ce fait, le Gouvemement veillera A ce que&#13;
le developpement sanitaire s'appuie sur des mecanismes de programmation transparents favorisant une&#13;
meilleure coordination des differentes sources de financement, y compris la participation communautaire.&#13;
La finalite de ces mecanismes est de permettre un developpement sanitaire harmonieux, coherent, bas6 sur&#13;
des criteres de rationalite dans la gestion et offrant des garanties de durabilite.&#13;
5.     Les turbulences politico-ethniques que le pays connait depuis octobre 1993 suggerent un&#13;
redoublement d'efforts en vue de mettre en oeuvre des strategies sectorielles innovatrices visant a&#13;
contribuer au processus de retour A la paix entam6 par le Gouvernement. Ainsi, la relance des activites de&#13;
soins dans les formations sanitaires devra sans nul doute faire renaitre l'espoir de la population par le&#13;
travail et favoriser un regain de confiance vis-a-vis des structures gouvernementales. De plus, une&#13;
formation sanitaire fonctionnelle est le lieu privilegid par excellence de vehicule de messages educatifs non&#13;
seulement en faveur d'une bonne sante mais surtout en faveur de la cohabitation pacifique.&#13;
B. ANALYSE DE LA SITUATION SANITAIRE&#13;
(a)    Principaux problemes de sante&#13;
6.     Avant la crise, l'etat de sante des burundais etait dejA precaire. Les taux de mortalite infantile, des&#13;
moins de cinq ans et maternelle etaient respectivement de 110 pour mille, 173 pour mille et de 600 deces&#13;
maternels pour 100.000 naissances vivantes. Les principales causes de maladies et de deces sont: le&#13;
paludisme, les maladies respiratoires et les maladies diarrheiques. A ce tableau suffisamment evocateur, il&#13;
faut ajouter des taux tres eleves de malnutrition aigue et chronique chez l'enfant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 27&#13;
7.     Le Sida a pris une ampleur tellement alarmante au Burundi qu'il represente aujourd'hui une grave&#13;
menace pour le developpement socio-economique du pays. D'apres les resultats d'une enquete, la sero-&#13;
prevalence de l'infection dans la population a revele que les zones urbaines et semi-urbaines etaient les&#13;
plus touchees (15%). On observe malheureusement que ce probleme s'aggrave d'annee en annee. Les&#13;
projections faites par le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Sida illustrent A juste titre la pression que&#13;
ce fleau exerce sur la vie socio-economique du pays: plus de 80% des lits d'h6pitaux dans les services de&#13;
Medecine Interne sont occupes par les malades du Sida; le cout des medicaments pour traiter les infections&#13;
opportunistes est exorbitant; le nombre d'orphelins crolt de jour en jour.&#13;
8.      Le taux de natalite est estime A 47 pour mille avec un Indice Synthetique de Fecondite (ISF) tres&#13;
eleve; 6,9 enfants par femme en 1990. Le taux de croissance annuelle est de 3,1% avec une forte densite&#13;
de 208 habitants par km2. L'esperance de vie A la naissance est parmi les plus basses du monde avec 50&#13;
ans pour les hommes et 52 pour les femmes.&#13;
9.     11 ressort d'une analyse de situation faite au mois de juin 1994 et sur base des donnees de&#13;
morbidite et mortalite recueillies par les intervenants sur terrain que le visage epidemiologique a fortement&#13;
change du fait qu'on enregistre une augmentation tres sensible de la frequence des endemo-epidemies&#13;
majeures suite A la depreciation globale des conditions socio-economiques liees A la crise. La malnutrition&#13;
chronique est passee de 26% A 40% dans les camps des deplaces. La malnutrition aigue dans les groupes&#13;
les plus vulnerables, particulirement les moins de cinq ans et les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, est&#13;
estim&amp;e A 10%.&#13;
(b)     Fonctionnement des services de sante&#13;
10.    Le systAme de sante est articule sur trois niveaux:&#13;
*   Le niveau central qui est charge de la formulation de la politique sectorielle, de la planification,&#13;
de l'elaboration des strategies d'intervention, de la coordination de l'aide apportee au secteur, de&#13;
la definition des normes de qualite, du suivi et de l'evaluation, de la formation continue et de base.&#13;
Ce niveau souffre encore de la faiblesse dans la planification et la gestion du secteur. On observe&#13;
un centralisme du systeme national de sante se traduisant par des programmes verticaux, et une&#13;
gestion des credits alloues aux h6pitaux et centres de sante par l'administration centrale.&#13;
*    Le niveau intermediaire qui est represente par 15 provinces sanitaires responsables de la&#13;
coordination des activites de sante dans tout le pays ainsi que la formation continue du personnel&#13;
de sante. Ce niveau n'est pas suffisamment outille pour pouvoir accomplir sa mission:&#13;
insuffisance en qualite et en quantite de ressources materielles et financieres pour assurer une&#13;
bonne coordination, et manque de capacites gestionnaires adequates.&#13;
*   Le niveau peripherique est compose par l'ensemble de tous les centres de sante loges dans les&#13;
114 communes du pays.&#13;
11.    Le reseau de soins est organise sur trois niveaux de reference. Le premier niveau comprend 270&#13;
centres de sante et correspond au premier contact avec les professionnels de la sante pour dispenser les&#13;
soins de sante primaires. Le deuxieme niveau comprend 26 h6pitaux de premiere reference situes aux&#13;
chefs-lieux des provinces et dans les secteurs. Le troisieme niveau comprend cinq h6pitaux de deuxieme&#13;
reference dont deux A Bujumbura et trois A l'interieur du pays. De plus, il existe deux h6pitaux specialises:&#13;
un centre neuropsychiatrique et un sanatorium. La qualite des services dans ces formations sanitaires laisse&#13;
A desirer parce qu'il y a penurie frequente de medicaments essentiels, un personnel insuffisant et peu&#13;
motive, une faiblesse dans la gestion et une v6tuste des infrastructures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                                                   ANNEX7&#13;
Page 3 of 27&#13;
12.    La couverture geographique est assez bonne puisqu'on estime qu'il y a un hopital pour 180.000&#13;
habitants. Neanmoins, il existe des disparites regionales en faveur surtout de Ia capitale. Le pays compte&#13;
aujourd'hui envircn 300 centres de sante. Ce taux de desserte est tres satisfaisant puisqu'on estime que&#13;
80% de la population burundaise vit dans un rayon de 5 km autour d'un centre de sante.&#13;
13.    Avant la crise, la couverture de certaines activites preventives etait excellente. En effet, depuis&#13;
1989, la couverture vaccinale des nourrissons ages de moins d'un an s'est maintenue au-dessus de 80%&#13;
pour tous les antigenes. De meme, la disponibilite des services dtait de 94% pour les consultations&#13;
prenatales. Actuellement, suite aux effets de la crise sur les services de sante, la couverture vaccinale a&#13;
fortement baisse e t est estimee A 35%. Cette baisse est due principalement A l'interruption de la chaine du&#13;
froid, A la desorg.misation des services de soins et au deplacement des populations.&#13;
14.    Par conire, 25% des femmes enceintes accouchaient dans un milieu protege, les h6pitaux et&#13;
centres de sante publics etaient et restent sous utilises pour les activites curatives. On estime que les&#13;
patients qui ont recours aux prestations de soins curatifs des centres de sante ne depassent pas 20% de&#13;
population qui nt:cessite ces soins. Cette faible frequentation des services curatifs est due principalement A&#13;
une mauvaise qualite des services offerts A la population dans les etablissements de soins publics. Cette&#13;
mauvaise qualitd des services s'explique en grande partie par une rupture frequente en medicaments&#13;
essentiels, une absence de politique de service, de normes de gestion et de procedures de travail, un&#13;
personnel instable, pas motive et peu responsable et une formation insuffisante du personnel au regard des&#13;
taches qui lui sornt confides.&#13;
15.    La crise a paralyse de facon sensible le systeme de sante burundais puisqu'on observe des&#13;
problemes de forictionnement importants qui ont considerablement reduit sa capacite de prise en charge des&#13;
problemes de sarit. Les principales causes de dysfonctionnement sont: la reduction importante des effectifs&#13;
de sante en posl:e (fuite, deces, depart massif du personnel rwandais); la faiblesse, voire I'absence des&#13;
structures d'encadrement et de supervision, la penurie des medicainents et la desorganisation du systeme&#13;
d'approvisionnemnent et de distribution, et la faiblesse des moyens logistiques et de transport. Par contre, le&#13;
systeme de santd burundais n'a pas souffert de dommages physiques severes.&#13;
(c)     Financ-ement des services de sante&#13;
16.    Les d6penses de sante sont estimees A 7 dollars americains par tete d'habitants. Les principales&#13;
sources de financement sont de cinq ordres: les ressources publiques intemes et extemes (70%  des&#13;
depenses totales de la sante), la Mutuelle de la Fonction Publique (16%), le secteur pharmaceutique prive&#13;
(7%), le secteur prive non lucratif (5%), et le recouvrement des couts dans les formations sanitaires&#13;
publiques (2%).&#13;
17.    De 1984 A 1994, la part du budget ordinaire alloue A la sante etait de 5 A 6% du budget de&#13;
fonctionnement de l'Etat. La repartition du budget ordinaire de la sante respecte presque toujours les&#13;
memes proportions: 60% pour le salaire du personnel et 20% pour les medicaments. Les depenses&#13;
d'investissement sont A 90% fmancees par l'aide exterieure (1990).&#13;
18.    La muruelle de la Fonction Publique, qui ne couvre que 7% de la population totale, avait en 1991&#13;
un budget total qui representait 75% du budget de fonctionnement alloue au Ministere de la Sante&#13;
Publique.&#13;
19.    Les soins medicaux des travailleurs du secteur prive formel sont pris en charge A 100% par les&#13;
employeurs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 27&#13;
20.    Le recouvrement des coAts dans les formnations sanitaires publiques est le fruit des ventes de la&#13;
carte d'assurance-maladie et l'argent recolte A partir du paiement A l'acte. On enregistre seulement 25% de&#13;
la population qui achete la CAM depuis 1984. Cette situation est due principalement a la qualite des&#13;
services qui laisse A desirer dans les formations sanitaires publiques. De plus, le produit de vente des CAM&#13;
profite presque exclusivement A ]'administration communale. Le personnel de sante oeuvrant dans les&#13;
formations sanitaires non encore autonomes n'est pas du tout motive pour percevoir les recettes etant&#13;
donne que ces dernieres rentrent directement soit dans les caisses communales soit au tresor public.&#13;
C. ORIENTATIONS STRATEGIQUES&#13;
21.    L'analyse de la situation sanitaire faite avant et apres la crise montre A suffisance que l'etat de&#13;
sante des burundais se degrade de plus en plus. Cette situation interpelle le Gouvemement a redoubler&#13;
d'efforts pour ne pas perdre les acquis de la decennie ecoulee en matiere de sante. En effet, une population&#13;
en mauvaise sante ne peut en aucune fa$on pretendre A un developpement socio-economique.&#13;
22.    Pour ce faire, le Gouvemement devra d'abord elaborer un programme de relance du systeme de&#13;
sante avant de penser A un developpement a plus long terme. Pendant cette periode de relance, il importe&#13;
que l'elaboration des strategies adoptees par le Gouvernement avant la crise puisse etre finalisee en tenant&#13;
compte des effets de la crise sur le secteur de la sante. Les principales strategies qui devront faire l'objet de&#13;
cet exercice sont les suivantes: (i) la decentralisation du systeme de sante par la creation et le renforcement&#13;
des bureaux provinciaux de sante et la mise en autonomie de gestion d'abord des hopitaux et plus tard des&#13;
centres de sante; (ii) le developpement des ressources humaines; (iii) I'aamelioration des mecanismes de&#13;
fuiancement des services de sante bases sur les principes d'equite et de solidarite; (iv) I'amelioration de&#13;
l'accessibilite du medicament par l'approvisionnement, la gestion et le bon usage; (v) le developpement&#13;
des strategies innovatrices de la sante en matiere de reproduction comme pilier de la maitrise des&#13;
problemes demographiques; (vi) la lutte contre les endemo-epidemies avec un accent particulier sur la lutte&#13;
contre le VIH/SIDA, et enfin (vii) le renforcement des services de sante de base et des hBpitaux&#13;
peripheriques.&#13;
23.    A l'issue de cet exercice, les activites decoulant de ces strategies devront etre consignees dans un&#13;
plan de developpement sanitaire A moyen et long terme. La mise en oeuvre de ce plan suivra les axes&#13;
fondamentaux ci-apres:&#13;
La decentralisation du Systeme National de sante&#13;
24.    Le Ministere de la Sante Publique a un souci constant de decentraliser le systeme de sante depuis&#13;
plus de quinze ans. Les actions menees revetaient un caractere isole et ce n'est qu'en 1993 que le Ministere&#13;
de la Sante Publique a entamne en etroite collaboration avec ses partenaires des reflexions sur une strategie&#13;
coherente de decentralisation du systeme de sante. Cette strategie s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une politique de&#13;
refornes sociales et economiques qui se concretise par la mise en route d'un processus de democratisation.&#13;
La decentralisation permet d'integrer les beneficiaires dans l'elaboration des orientations politiques et&#13;
sociales futures du pays, renforcer le pouvoir des intervenants des niveaux peripheriques, et augmenter&#13;
l'efficacite et l'efficience des interventions sectorielles. II s'agit d'une modification de l'equilibre entre le&#13;
niveau central et les niveaux peripheriques. Cette strategie se propose comme une reponse institutionnelle a&#13;
la demande de participation des populations a la gestion des affaires publiques.&#13;
25.    La transformation des roles et responsabilites des niveaux provincial et peripherique va modifier&#13;
l'equilibre institutionnel de l'ensemble du secteur de la sante. Un document de politique de la&#13;
decentralisation du systeme de sante sera elabore et precisera notamment les roles des differents niveaux et&#13;
les rapports qu'ils auront avec les autorites administratives et politiques locales. Un comite de suivi de la&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 of 27&#13;
decentralisation sera cree pour porter la responsabilite de piloter le processus. Le niveau central doit&#13;
renforcer ses fonctions actuelles qui sont d'elaborer la politique et la legislation sanitaire nationale;&#13;
d'deaborer les normes sanitaires; de contr6ler la qualite des soins; de planifier les activites de sante dans le&#13;
pays; d'organiser la formation de base; de coordonner la supervision, I'evaluation et la formation continue;&#13;
et coordonner la mobilisation et les allocations des ressources nationales et extemes. II abandonnera par&#13;
contre son r6le d'operateur dans la realisation des divers programmes sur le terrain qui revient aux niveaux&#13;
provincial et peripheriques.&#13;
26.     Au niveau provincial, le bureau provincial de sante sera la structure administrative et technique&#13;
chargee de l'application de la politique sanitaire nationale en tenant compte des besoins specifiques locaux&#13;
et des moyens disponibles et/ou mobilisables. Dirige par un Medecin Directeur de la province sanitaire, ce&#13;
bureau va jouer le r6le de conseiller des autorites politiques et administratives dans le domaine de la sante.&#13;
Les fonctions devolues a ce bureau sont les suivantes: planification et organisation de toutes les&#13;
interventions en matiere de sante programmees au sein de la province; gestion de toutes les ressources&#13;
allouees a la province pour le fonctionnement des programmes de sante; organisation d'une supervision-&#13;
formation a l'intention du personnel des services de sante de la province; et promotion de la collaboration&#13;
intra et intersectorielle en faveur de la sante. En outre, pour reussir sa mission le bureau provincial de sante&#13;
devra disposer de toutes les ressources necessaires concordantes avec ses fonctions.  En 1995, le&#13;
Gouvemement a decide de doter les 15 bureaux provinciaux de sante d'allocations budgetaires directes.&#13;
27.     Au niveau local, il s'avere indispensable de prevoir un conseil communal de sante qui devra&#13;
conseiller les autorites communales dans le choix des priorites de la commune en matiere de sante.&#13;
28.     L'autonomie de gestion des institutions de soins a ete choisie comme strategie susceptible de&#13;
palier aux dysfonctionnements rencontres dans ces structures et permettre de maximiser et gerer&#13;
rationnellement les ressources disponibles et potentielles. Les effets de la crise sur la qualite des services&#13;
offerts dans les formations sanitaires publiques ont une fois de plus fait ressortir le caractere prioritaire de&#13;
la mise en oeuvre de cette strategie. Pour ce faire, le Gouvemement devra mettre en place des mecanismes&#13;
permettant la responsabilisation effective du personnel dans la gestion, I'amelioration de la motivation du&#13;
personnel, la prise de decision facile, rapide et rationnelle, la gestion efficace et efficiente des ressources&#13;
ainsi que la prise de conscience sur l'importance de la maintenance et de l'entretien des infrastructures&#13;
sanitaires. Pour eviter des derapages dans la mise en oeuvre de cette strategie, une politique generale de&#13;
l'autonomie de gestion sera elaboree sur base des conclusions issues d'un audit des h6pitaux beneficiant&#13;
deja de ce statut. En principe, tous les h6pitaux du pays devraient etre en autonomie de gestion d'ici 1997.&#13;
La gestion des centres de sante devrait etre cedee a moyen terme a un comite des utilisateurs oeuvrant sous&#13;
la supervision du Conseil Communal de Sante.&#13;
Dveloppement des ressources humaines&#13;
29.     Le Gouvernement instituera une strategie de developpement des ressources humaines dans le&#13;
secteur sanitaire qui offre des professionnels de la sante en nombre et en qualite appropriee pour le&#13;
developpement d'une politique de soins de sante primaire a toutes les couches de la population du pays. La&#13;
formation de base et la formation continue des professionnels de sante suivront cet objectif par la defmition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 6 of 27&#13;
de programmes de formation orientes vers les soins de sante primaires et par l'organisation systematique&#13;
du suivi de ces programmes pour en maintenir la qualite. L'equite dans la distribution territoriale des&#13;
m6decins et du personnel paramedical est une priorite. Dans la periode de rehabilitation qui suit les&#13;
evenements d'octobre 1993, le Gouvemement instaurera de facon temporaire des mesures incitatives&#13;
(notamment les indemnites de deplacement) pour retablir un minimum  de services dans les regions&#13;
affectees. A moyen terme, et dans le cadre d'une reflexion generale sur la reforne administrative publique,&#13;
le Gouvemement developpera une politique de gestion de carriere de nature a motiver les professionnels de&#13;
sante appeles a travailler en milieu rural.&#13;
Les m6canismes de financement des services de sante&#13;
30.    L'amelioration des mecanismes de fmancement reste basee sur les principes d'equite et de&#13;
solidarite avec la pleine participation des communautes. Ainsi, pour completer les modes de fmancement&#13;
deja existants, le Gouvemement avait dejA opte pour la creation d'une assurance-maladie pour le secteur&#13;
non structure. Sans toutefois revenir sur la pertinence de ce choix gouvememental, les effets de la crise sur&#13;
l'environnement socio-economique du pays en general et sur le systeme de sante en particulier obligent A&#13;
l'aborder de facon progressive et adaptee A la nouvelle situation.&#13;
31.    Le Ministbre de la Sante Publique s'attellera A developper des mecanismes permettant&#13;
l'amelioration du systeme actuel de la Carte d'Assistance Medicale (CAM). Ces mecanismes devront se&#13;
baser essentiellement sur la gestion des recettes de la CAM par le secteur sante, I'augmentation des&#13;
avantages de la CAM aux beneficiaires pour la rendre plus attrayante, et l'amelioration des recettes de la&#13;
CAM en lien avec les capacites de paiement de la population. Le Gouvernement mettra en place un&#13;
mecanisme de prise en charge des indigents.&#13;
32.    Concemant les depenses de fonctionnement hors-salaires du Ministere de la Sante Publique, le&#13;
Gouvemement s'engage non seulement A augmenter en ternes reels les biens et services en 1995 et en&#13;
1996, mais egalement A maintenir ce niveau de depenses en termes reels par habitant en 1997 et en 1998.&#13;
33.    La mise en place de ces mecanismes necessite absolument I'amelioration des procedures&#13;
budgetaires se traduisant par la maitrise du Programme de Depenses Publiques (PDP), du Programme&#13;
d'Investissements Publics (PIP), du Programme de Cooperation Technique (PCT), et la preparation des&#13;
budgets de la Sante. Les mecanismes renforces actuels de coordination de l'aide exterieure seront&#13;
maintenus pendant la phase de relance. La concertation trimestrielle avec les bailleurs de fonds se&#13;
poursuivra.&#13;
L'am6lioration de I'accessibilite du midicament&#13;
par l'approvisionnement, la gestion et le bon usage&#13;
34.    Le medicament constitue la composante la plus importante pour les soins curatifs. On ne peut pas&#13;
parler de l'amelioration de la qualite des services si le medicament n'est pas disponible et accessible A toute&#13;
la population. De ce fait, la reussite des differentes reformes sectorielles en cours, notamment l'autonomie&#13;
de gestion des institutions de soins et l'amelioration des mecanismes de paiement des soins depend de la&#13;
disponibilite et I'accessibilite du medicament.&#13;
35.    Pour remedier aux carences des systemes d'approvisionnement et de distribution des medicaments&#13;
et palier ainsi A une penurie eventuelle, le Gouvemement a decide de mettre en place un systeme&#13;
d'approvisionnement et de distribution efficace, durable et autogere. Le depot Central du Ministere de la&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Sante Publique evoluera progressivement vers une Centrale d'Achat en passant par une phase de transition&#13;
d'autonomie de gestion au cours de laquelle il rehabilitera les stocks et renforcera les capacites de gestion.&#13;
L'objectif de la future centrale d'achat est de mettre A la disposition des populations des medicaments de&#13;
bonne qualite, A un prix abordable pour celles-ci. Le Gouvemement elaborera et mettra en oeuvre une&#13;
politique pharmaceutique nationale dans laquelle la centrale d'achat s'inserera pour faire partie integrante&#13;
d'un developpement coherent du systeme pharmaceutique.&#13;
La sante en matiere de reproduction&#13;
36.    Le Gouvemement veillera A un meilleur developpement integre des differents volets de Sante&#13;
maternelle: Surveillance de la grossesse, de l'accouchement et du post partum ainsi que de la planification&#13;
familiale. Pour la sante maternelle, il s'agira de developper une politique de services qui prendra en&#13;
compte la sante de la mere dans sa globalite. Ainsi en ce qui conceme le ddveloppement du volet de la&#13;
surveillance prenatale, du travail et de l'accouchement, il s'agira d'deaborer des normes et standards qui&#13;
serviront de guide A toutes les prestations de services. Le Gouvemement veillera a equiper les differentes&#13;
structures sanitaires afm qu'elles offrent des services de sante en matiere de reproduction de qualitd. 11&#13;
mettra egalement a disposition le personnel de sante competent et veillera A sa formation continue.&#13;
Concemant le volet de la planification familiale, le Gouvernement du Burundi s'efforcera de rendre&#13;
disponible une gamme eIargie de methodes contraceptives afin de permettre a la population cible de&#13;
pouvoir faire un choix approprie. Le Gouvemement developpera un systeme d'information, d'education et&#13;
de communication qui permettra A toute la population du Burundi d'avoir acces a toutes les informations&#13;
utiles concernant le domaine de la sante en matiere de reproduction. Ce systeme utilisera plusieurs canaux&#13;
de diffusion et sur base de messages appropries, adaptes aux contextes de la realite burundaise. Ces deux&#13;
axes strategiques principaux seront appuyes par un systeme general d' information et de logistique&#13;
dynamique permettant un suivi regulier des performances. 11 seront egalement soutenus par un programme&#13;
de developpement de ressources humaines impliquees dans la promotion du programme de sante en&#13;
matiere de reproduction.&#13;
La lutte contre les endemo-6pidemies&#13;
37.    Le Gouvernement va privilegier l'attribution de ses ressources au renforcement des programmes&#13;
de sante publique visant A freiner les maladies endemo-epidemiques qui representent un fleau social et&#13;
dconomique. La strategie proposee est une demarche globale qui s'attaque a tout l'eventail des maladies&#13;
endemo-epidemiques en associant les communautes rurales et urbaines. Cette approche met l'accent sur:&#13;
*   Les mesures preventives multisectorielles qui reduiront les vecteurs de transmission des maladies,&#13;
qui mettront un terme A la contamination de l'eau de boisson, des aliments et de 1'environnement&#13;
par les matieres fecales. Les interventions seront developpees pour ameliorer l'approvisionnement&#13;
en eau salubre, I'assainissement du milieu et l'education A l'hygiene de vie.&#13;
*   Le renforcement du systeme de sante pour revitaliser les activites preventives de vaccinations des&#13;
enfants et des femmes alterees par les evenements de 1993 et fournir des services de base ainsi&#13;
que les medicaments essentiels pour affronter les principales endemies.&#13;
*   La prise en charge des populations suivant une logique de soins integres, continus et decentralis6s&#13;
developpes par les services de sante de base de l'ensemble du pays.&#13;
Pour enrayer les endemo-epidemies les plus meurtrieres et les plus debilitantes, les orientations specifiques&#13;
sont les suivantes:&#13;
*   Dans la lutte contre le paludisme, des mesures d'assainissement du milieu sont envisagees telles&#13;
que les pulverisations intradomicilaires. L'usage de moustiquaires imnpregnees sera promu et les&#13;
services de sante seront appuyes dans leur capacite de traiter les malades.&#13;

Supervision Plan-&#13;
1.     Bank Supervision input&#13;
Regular supervision needs, which amount to an average of 12 staffweeks per year, are&#13;
described in the attached Table. In addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports,&#13;
procurement and disbursement actions, audit review, etc., are estimated to require an average&#13;
of ten staffweeks of various specialists inputs per ainum.&#13;
2.     Borrower's contribution to supervision&#13;
(a)    Progress reports will be submitted on a semi-annual basis, according to the&#13;
standard progress report discussed with PCT during appraisal (Project&#13;
implementation manual). The PCT will collect inputs from each responsible&#13;
head of component and prepare the reports which will be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the Minister of Health before sending them to IDA.&#13;
(b)    Once a year, a joint Government/lDA  mission will take place to review&#13;
progress. MOPfl will also submit to IDA for review, by October 31 each year&#13;
at the latest, starting in 1995, the draft investment and recurrent MOPH&#13;
budgets for the following year, and a three-year rolling public investment&#13;
program  in health.   In addition, by June 30, 1998 at the latest, a&#13;
Government/IDA mid-term review will be undertaken to assess progress in&#13;
achieving project development objectives.  To facilitate this review, the&#13;
Government will submit to IDA by May 15, 1998 at the latest, a mid-term&#13;
project review document.&#13;
(c)   The PCT  will be responsible for coordinating  arrangements for IDA&#13;
supervision missions and for providing information to them.&#13;
(d)    Mission briefing and wrap-up meetings will be chaired by the Minister of&#13;
Public Health and, in his/her absence, by the Director General of Health and&#13;
will include all heads of departments and agencies concerned.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Second Health and Population Project
            will improve the health status of Burundi's population
            and contribute to sustainable per capita income growth by
            slowing population growth, thus reducing population
            pressures on resources. It will help increase the
            availability, quality and efficiency of health services and
            make them more responsive to the public's expectations.
            Together with the contributions of other donors, the project
            will constitute a coherent program to support the government
            in developing strategies to address the most critical sector
            issues. Specifically the project will: (i) strengthen the
            Ministry of Public Health's capacity to design and
            implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the efficiency
            and affordability of health care delivery in rural areas;
            (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal
            and child mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial
            health and family planning behaviors.
