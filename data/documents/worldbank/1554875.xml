ABSTRACT&#13;
The paper attempts to analyze the magnitude of the setback in&#13;
capital accumulation in Eastern and Southern Africa and the proximate causes&#13;
of this phenomenon. The sample consists of 16 countries and available data&#13;
for the late 1960s and 1970s are explored. Given the weakness of the&#13;
statistics, the authors rely more on expert observations than on rigorous&#13;
quantitative assessments; although available data are analysed. Capital&#13;
formation increased fairly rapidly during 19 67-1974 but then slowed down&#13;
considerably. Investment was financed to a considerable extent by external&#13;
concessional assistance; rapid growth in such funds during the late 1970s&#13;
helped offset declining national savings rates to some extent. The setback in&#13;
investment rates was greatly accentuated by a large and widespread&#13;
deterioration in the productivity of capital brought about by the impact of&#13;
government policy, strained absorptive capacity and a variety of exogenous&#13;
factors.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
1.        The 1970s was a disappointing decade for the economic development of&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa and particularly of the oil-importing countries of Eastern&#13;
and Southern Africa. The aim of this paper is to study this experience in 16&#13;
countries with a special focus on capital accumulation. We try to answer the&#13;
following questions:&#13;
-    What were the common characteristics of this experience and what&#13;
were the elements of diversity?&#13;
-    Was the setback in development mainly the result of a slowing down&#13;
in the rate of investment or was it caused in large part by a fall&#13;
in the productivity of capital?&#13;
-    To the extent that capital accumulation slowed down, was it the&#13;
result of a lag in domestic savings or a turnaround in external&#13;
capital inflow?&#13;
-    What factors explain the declining productivity of capital, in cases&#13;
where this phenomenon was a prominent part of the setback in&#13;
economic development?&#13;
2.        By focusing on capital accumulation, we do not intend to take part&#13;
in the debate on the role of capital in economic development. Much has been&#13;
written on this topic by those (e.g. Arthur Lewis, Rostow, Harrod, Domar) who&#13;
assign capital a strategic part, and by others (e.g. Cairncross, Frankel) who&#13;
emphasise the contribution of technology, organization, entrepreneurship,&#13;
etc. (Meier, 1964). The long run development of Eastern and Southern African&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
countries requires large doses of capital combined in appropriate ways with&#13;
the growth of human skills, the evolution and adoption of suitable innovations&#13;
and the maturation of indigenous institutions. The setback in capital&#13;
accumulation and in economic development during the 1970s might have occurred&#13;
precisely because factors of production have not been combined in the right&#13;
quantities. In any event, our emphasis on capital in this paper should not be&#13;
read to mean that we assign this factor a preeminent role.&#13;
3.        Our analysis of capital productivity is cast in terms of the&#13;
incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) which relates investment to changes in&#13;
GDP during the decades of the 1960s and 1970s. The intention is to capture&#13;
long-term changes in this coefficient and thereby to study the secular&#13;
relationship in the supply of capital and that of net production. The ICOR,&#13;
in this context, will be influenced by the pace of technical progress, the&#13;
growth of professional and managerial skills and the quality of organizations.&#13;
4.        The ICOR is not narrowly concerned with new investment and its&#13;
impact on output. It is influenced not only by income attributable to new&#13;
investment but also by income generated by existing assets. And since&#13;
existing assets are generally very much larger than additions to the capital&#13;
stock, the ICOR is much more powerfully affected by the productivity of&#13;
existing assets than by the quality of new investment. For example, a decline&#13;
in capacity utilization throughout the economy caused by chronic scarcity of&#13;
foreign exchange will raise the ICOR substantially even though new investments&#13;
are highly productive.&#13;
5.        An increase in the ICOR associated with the slowing down of GDP&#13;
growth is not by itself a convincing explanation. To trace the final causes&#13;
of the retardation, it is necessary to look further back into myriad factors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that determine this coefficient. Nevertheless, the ICOR is a convenient&#13;
summary statistic that allows us to decompose changes in GDP growth into those&#13;
attributable to a deterioration in capital productivity and others related to&#13;
a fall in the rate of investment.&#13;
6.        The ICOR is a familiar enough coefficient with many defects (see&#13;
Reddaway, 1962). In the Eastern Africa context, these defects are compounded&#13;
by the following problems. Firstly, the proper measure of ICOR should utilize&#13;
net fixed investment. Using gross rather than net investment introduces a&#13;
bias, since the replacement component of investment is smaller at higher rates&#13;
of growth of investment. Total investment includes inventories which may be&#13;
sizable in primary-producing (and especially mineral-producing) countries in&#13;
some years. Unfortunately, neither the extent of depreciation nor the fixed&#13;
component of investment is known in many African economies and the measure of&#13;
investment used in this paper is gross, total investment 1/. Secondly, the&#13;
ICOR is not a very stable statistic. Investment is a volatile variable and so&#13;
is output. Eastern African countries generally have large agricultural&#13;
sectors, subject to the vagaries of weather. We have used three-year averages&#13;
to deal with these fluctuations but we may not have entirely eliminated them.&#13;
Thirdly, many countries in Africa undertook massive, once-for-all type of&#13;
investment projects during our period of study. Examples of these are the&#13;
Tazara Railroad (Tanzania and Zambia), and the Inga-Shaba hydroelectric&#13;
project (Zaire). In these cases a marked rise in the ICOR over several years&#13;
is inevitable, but this rise does not necessarily mean that capital&#13;
productivity is falling.&#13;
1/ This is not unprecedented in empirical, development literature. Kuznets&#13;
(1961), for instance, has used this concept.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
7.        The data base for analysis is weak.   Statistics on investment and&#13;
output in the non-monetized sector are particularly unreliable. National&#13;
account statistics prepared by official agencies in Eastern Africa are subject&#13;
to many other pitfalls (Annex III). We have relied mainly on data from these&#13;
sources, but it has been subjected to tests of consistency and adjusted in&#13;
some cases. Most of the statistical analysis in this paper is at the&#13;
economy-wide level. A brief enquiry into sectoral ICORs did not lead very&#13;
far. We have not attempted to establish the statistical relationship between&#13;
investment rates or ICORs and other structural or policy variables, given the&#13;
scarcity of reliable information.&#13;
8.        This paper is not intended as a rigorous, quantitative analysis of&#13;
the setback in Eastern and Southern African development. Data are cited in&#13;
support of conclusions, but the statistical analysis does not generate them:&#13;
we have relied much more on expert observations of colleagues who have&#13;
followed developments in these countries over a fairly long time and who have&#13;
familiarity with field conditions in individual countries.&#13;
II. First, A Look At the Record&#13;
9.        Eastern Africa passed through a disappointing decade of economic&#13;
growth in the seventies. The median growth rate in Eastern Africa, in the&#13;
1960s was above that of a group of largely Asian countries at similar, low&#13;
levels of per capita income.   During the 1970s the reverse was true; growth in&#13;
comparator countries was higher than in Eastern Africa (Annex Table 1). If&#13;
the period 1968-1978, on which this paper focuses, is considered, then the&#13;
decline in growth in Eastern Africa is seen to be concentrated in the latter&#13;
half of the period (Annex Table 2). The relative position of Eastern Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is worse, if comparison is made with a group of oil-importing middle-income&#13;
countries in East Asia. They recorded GDP growth rates of 8.2% per year&#13;
during the 1960-1973 period and 7.5% per annum during 1973-1980, compared to&#13;
the Eastern African average which fell short of 5% per annum in both periods.&#13;
10.       However, the Eastern Africa experience has been diverse.   In a few&#13;
countries such as Malawi, Kenya, Botswana and Lesotho the growth rate of&#13;
output in the seventies exceeded that of China, the low-income comparator&#13;
country with the most impressive record. In over a third of the Eastern&#13;
Africa countries, the growth rate was higher than in India or Pakistan.&#13;
Counterbalancing this was the experience of Ethiopia, Zaire, Uganda,&#13;
Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Zambia. In these countries output growth was either&#13;
very low or even negative, especially in the 1973-78 period; and they greatly&#13;
lowered the Eastern Africa averages.&#13;
11.       The decline in the growth of income in Eastern Africa has been&#13;
paralleled by a decline in the growth rate of investment. In real terms, the&#13;
median annual growth rate of investment fell from almost 10% in the 1960s to&#13;
less than 3% in the 1970s (Annex Table 3). At the same time, the median ICOR&#13;
rose from 4.3 in 1967-1973 to 5.2 in 1973-79 (Annex Table 5). In this area&#13;
too, however, there is considerable diversity. Overall investment growth&#13;
rates have been impressive in Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Lesotho, Swaziland and&#13;
Botswana (Annex Table 4). On the other hand, negative investment growth rates&#13;
characterized Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia.&#13;
12.       The rise in ICORs is observed mainly in the 1973-79 sub-period. The&#13;
ratio rose in eight countries and in another three (Zaire, TJganda and&#13;
Zimbabwe) it had turned negative. In contrast, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan and&#13;
Tanzania showed a falling ICOR in the 1973-79 period. In six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
countries--Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Lesotho, Kenya and Botswana, ICORs were&#13;
relatively low (between 2.8 and 5.3), even in 1979 2/. Yet in six others the&#13;
ICORs had reached double digit or negative magnitudes.&#13;
13.       These preliminary findings suggest that it is misleading to treat&#13;
the Eastern African countries as a homogenous group which suffered declining&#13;
growth of output as well as investment, accompanied by rising ICORs. While&#13;
this was true of countries with the bulk of population and GNP in the region,&#13;
there were significant exceptions. In this paper, accordingly, two&#13;
statistical groupings have been used. In the first group are countries with&#13;
relatively high rates of growth of investment and output and reasonable levels&#13;
of ICOR. In this group are included Botswana, Lesotho, Rwanda, Malawi,&#13;
Swaziland, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and Sudan. The second group consists of&#13;
countries with low rates of investment and output growth, accompanied by high&#13;
or even negative ICORs. In this category fall Somalia, Zaire, Uganda, Zambia,&#13;
Ethiopia, Madagascar and Zimbabwe; they account for almost 60% of the&#13;
population and only a slightly smaller fraction of GDP of the entire sample.&#13;
14.       The criterion chosen to distinguish the two groups is whether the&#13;
rate of GDP growth for the 1967-1978 period exceeded or fell short of 4% per&#13;
annum 3/. Too much should not be read into the classification; it is purely&#13;
statistical. While there are similarities between the growth and investment&#13;
experience of countries in each category, their ranking by the investment&#13;
2/ Kuznets (1960) and Kuznets (1961) found gross ICORs lying between 4 and 6&#13;
in many countries. Carrington and Edwards (1979) estimated gross ICORs to&#13;
be between 4 and 8 in the mid-seventies in several major OECD countries.&#13;
See Annex Tables 6 and 7 for details.&#13;
3/ In terms of growth of per capita GDP, this would mean a growth rate of&#13;
approximately 1 to 1.5% for most of the same countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rate, ICOR, growth rate of GDP or other relevant series is not always&#13;
congruent. The Sudan and Tanzania deserve special mention in this context;&#13;
while we have put them in the first group on the basis of the chosen growth in&#13;
GDP criterion, they could just as well be assigned to the second group, if&#13;
emphasis was given to the behavior of savings or capacity utilization.&#13;
15.       The timing of the setback in investment and output also shows&#13;
considerable inter-country variability. The first oil price increase of&#13;
1973-74 is often taken as a watershed in the recent growth history of oil&#13;
importing developing countries. This event was clearly of importance in the&#13;
region, but it was far from decisive. Very specific influences were at work&#13;
in each country. In 1972, Idi Amin came to power in Uganda and initiated&#13;
major changes in policy. In 1974, Ethiopia underwent a revolutionary change&#13;
in government. In 1975 the civil conflict in Zimbabwe escalated. The same&#13;
year also saw a decline in copper prices which severly affected Zambia and&#13;
Zaire. Drought affected several countries during the mid-seventies. Many&#13;
countries reaped the benefits of the coffee boom of 1976-77 to variable&#13;
degrees. The East African Common Market collapsed in 1977. Thus, while the&#13;
oil price rise of 1973 was, undoubtedly, a major factor in the economy of each&#13;
country, it was not the only and perhaps not even the predominant shock in all&#13;
of them. For presentational purposes, the three-year average centered on 1973&#13;
has been taken as a rough dividing line to separate the data for the period&#13;
under study 4/.&#13;
16.       No country experienced a fall in GDP in the 1967-1973 sub-period,&#13;
but four countries suffered an absolute reverse during the 1973-78&#13;
sub-period. Moreover, during 1973-78 growth rates in output were lower in 10&#13;
4/ All growth rates are calculated using three-year averages as the base and&#13;
terminal period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
countries, relative to the earlier sub-period. In 11 countries the growth&#13;
rate of investment was lower in 1973-78 compared to 1967-73. In six countries&#13;
real investment declined in the latter sub-period, while this was the case in&#13;
only three countries in the 1967-73 period. The ICOR remained at a&#13;
satisfactory level in 1967-1973. ICORs were higher (ignoring very small&#13;
variations) in six countries and lower in eight, compared to the 1961-68&#13;
period. Except for Madagascar, no country had an unusually high ICOR in the&#13;
period upto 1973. The 1973-79 experience was much more unidirectional; in 12&#13;
countries the ICOR rose relative to the earlier sub-period.&#13;
17.       We recognize that splitting the sample of 16 countries into two&#13;
groups, on the basis of a purely statistical criterion, is useful, but hardly&#13;
sufficient. A great deal of diversity remains in each group. For example,&#13;
Group I could be subdivided into (i) the BLS countries, i.e. Botswana, Lesotho&#13;
and Swaziland; (ii) countries facing acute demographic pressures, i.e.,&#13;
Malawi, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi; (iii) the rest, i.e., Tanzania and Sudan.&#13;
The BLS countries are not typical. Their distinguishing characteristics are&#13;
the following: (a) Each has a population of less than 1 million; (b) Given&#13;
their geographical position and land-locked nature, they have very intensive&#13;
economic relations with the Republic of South Africa (RSA). These include&#13;
trade, a large flow of migrant-worker remittances from RSA to BLS countries,&#13;
private investment from RSA into mining, tourism and commercial agriculture in&#13;
BLS countries and fiscal arrangements under the Southern African Customs&#13;
Union. The seeming economic success of BLS countries, at least in terms of&#13;
macro-economic variables, must be related in large part to the prosperity of&#13;
RSA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 9 -&#13;
18.       Demographic pressure is present in all 16 countries.   In fact, this&#13;
is a characteristic of the entire Sub-Saharan African region (see Faruqee and&#13;
Gulhati, 1983). However, in Malawi, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi, the&#13;
demographic problem exists in a much more acute phase because the margin of&#13;
cultivable, but not yet cultivated, land has narrowed considerably or&#13;
disappeared altogether. This subset of countries also has policy frames which&#13;
share several common characteristics, i.e., openness to foreign private&#13;
investment, encouragement of indigenous private enterprise, tolerance for&#13;
large numbers of expatriates and relative emphasis on the economic growth&#13;
objective as against equity.&#13;
19.       Tanzania and Sudan fall in a residual category, but they are very&#13;
different from one another. Tanzania is distinguished by its plentiful&#13;
physical potential and its sharp change of course symbolized by the Arusha&#13;
Declaration which rejected the private sector, outward-oriented, capitalist&#13;
strategy. Sudan also had its wave of nationalizations in 1970, but this&#13;
socialistic doctrine was reversed later on. It is a very large country in&#13;
physical size, but it is not richly endowed with infrastructure or natural&#13;
resources.&#13;
20.       Countries in Group II are also a diverse lot in terms of&#13;
institutional and policy frames as well as per capita income levels (Ethiopia&#13;
$120 and Zambia $540 in 1979). Ethiopia, Uganda and Zimbabwe have been&#13;
victims of civil strife to a much larger extent than the rest. Zambia and&#13;
Zaire share a heavy dependence on copper and the sharp fluctuation in its&#13;
international price. Ethiopia, Madagascar and Zambia have assigned a&#13;
commanding role to the public sector and placed a heavy emphasis on the equity&#13;
objective.&#13;

21.       These brief, descriptive notes bring out the complex nature of&#13;
social, political and economic reality in Eastern Africa. The aim of&#13;
explaining the setback in capital accumulation in terms of some easily&#13;
identifiable factors is not at all easy.&#13;
III. Behavior of Investment&#13;
22.       The slowing down in GDP growth could be the result of rising ICORs&#13;
or of declining investment ratios or of some combination of these factors. We&#13;
will examine the detailed evidence, first by focusing on the behavior of&#13;
investment and its ratio to GDP and later by studying ICORs.&#13;
23.       The investment ratio in the mid-sixties (see text table page 11)&#13;
was very low in Burundi and Rwanda and already on the high side in five&#13;
countries. During 1967-1973, the volume of investment expanded briskly, i.e.,&#13;
at double-digit growth rates in Malawi, Zaire and Lesotho (Annex Table 4).&#13;
The investment ratio rose rapidly in these countries and also in some other&#13;
cases.&#13;

24.       A comparison of investment rates in the mid-seventies between&#13;
Eastern Africa and other LDCs suggests that the former was not much&#13;
handicapped. We generated a sample of 24 low-income countries, 15 from the&#13;
region and 9 non-African low-income countries.   A regression equation was&#13;
fitted for the pooled sample of countries, relating the investment ratio to&#13;
per capita GDP in 1974-76. The estimated equation was:&#13;
_2&#13;
I/Y = 8.4202 + 0.0516 (y)       (R = 0.51)&#13;
Where I = gross national investment&#13;
Y = GDP at factor cost&#13;
and   y = GDP per capita in US dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
In Ethiopia, Sudan, Burundi, Madagascar and Zimbabwe the actual ratio lay&#13;
below the regression line (see Figure 1). The actual investment ratio was&#13;
above the regression line in Malawi, Tanzania, Lesotho, Botswana, Somalia,&#13;
Zaire and Zambia. Malawi, Lesotho and Zaire stand out in having an investment&#13;
ratio far higher than warranted by their level of per capita GDP. In Kenya&#13;
the actual and predicted ratios were approximately equal. We also calculated&#13;
a regression equation of 15 East African countries separately 5/. The East&#13;
African regression line remains above the regression line for the pooled&#13;
sample, but the distance between the two tends to diminish at higher levels of&#13;
per capita income.&#13;
25.       From this favorable position in the mid-seventies, the pace of&#13;
capital accumulation has slowed down considerably. The median growth rate in&#13;
the volume of investment slackened from a brisk 6.4% per annum during&#13;
1967-1973 to only 2.4% per annum in 1973-78. The text table on page 14 shows&#13;
that the volume of investment declined in absolute terms in six countries. It&#13;
is surprising to note, therefore, that in this period of widespread slowing&#13;
down, a number of countries experienced large increases in investment. There&#13;
was a dramatic turnaround in Burundi and Sudan who had experienced an&#13;
investment decline in the early 1970s, but who now saw a sharp rise (Annex&#13;
Table 4). Lesotho, Swaziland and Somalia maintained a substantial expansior.&#13;
in investment.&#13;
5/ The regression equation for 15 East African countries separately was&#13;

26.       Looking at the situation at the end of the 1970s, the investment&#13;
picture is particularly stark in two countries. In Uganda, the investment&#13;
ratio has dropped from a respectable 16% to 17 % of GDP in the late 1960s to&#13;
an abysmally low level of 3% to 4% now. This is catastrophic. In Ethiopia,&#13;
the drop is not as precipitous, i.e., from 15% to 9% in the same period, but&#13;
it is a cause for concern (Annex Table 8).&#13;
27.       The setback in investment is largely an African phenomenon.   Out of&#13;
63 non-African low-and middle-income countries listed in the World Development&#13;
Report, 1981, only 8% of the sample had negative investment growth rates in&#13;
the seventies. In Eastern Africa this was the case in 40% of the sample. All&#13;
the countries in Group II with the exception of Somalia had declining real&#13;
investment rates in this period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
28.       The slowing down of investment activity in Eastern Africa could be&#13;
the result of a relative scarcity of investable funds or strains on absorptive&#13;
capacity (reflected in lack of projects, shortages of trained personnel,&#13;
emergence of bottlenecks and delays in decision making (see Gulhati, 1967) or&#13;
some combination of these two factors). Given that at least eight countries&#13;
have experienced an expansion of investment at a rate of 6% per year or more&#13;
over the whole period 1967-1978, we should not discount the impact of strained&#13;
absorptive capacity in reining in investment. Central government investment&#13;
outlays in real terms doubled in Zaire in the early 1970s and trebled in&#13;
Malawi, Lesotho and Botswana during 1972-79 (Annex Table 9). Lack of projects&#13;
has been an issue in several instances. Availability of project managers,&#13;
engineers and accountants has been a chronic problem in most of these&#13;
countries. Bottlenecks, such as limited construction capacity and congestion&#13;
in ports have delayed project implementation in many places. Finally,&#13;
slowness of government decision making has been a pervasive phenomena&#13;
affecting all aspects of economic activity. These strains have not only&#13;
influenced the trend of capital accumulation but also its quality; a topic we&#13;
will discuss in the context of ICORs.&#13;
29.       Meanwhile, we will focus on the availability of savings--internal&#13;
and external--as a factor bearing on capital accumulation. Figure 2 shows&#13;
that while the median investment ratio for the whole sample rose from 16.5% to&#13;
24.1% between 1966/68 and 1973/75, the national savings ratio was fairly&#13;
flat. Subsequently, the average investment ratio dropped by about 3 points&#13;
and the savings ratio by almost 4 points. The proportionate contribution of&#13;
external savings in financing capital accumulation has tended to rise during&#13;
the period as a whole.&#13;

30.       National savings during the late 1960s were very low or negative in&#13;
more than one-third of the sample, as the table below shows. Burundi, Lesotho&#13;
and Botswana had negative savings at that time. Only Zambia had a high&#13;
savings coefficient. The record shows a substantial rise in savings till&#13;
about the middle of the 1970s. This was particularly the case in Malawi,&#13;
Swaziland, Botswana and Zimbabwe (see Annex Table 10).&#13;

compared with a broad sample of low-income countries. A regression of the&#13;
savings ratio in 1974-76 against per capita GDP for a sample of 9 comparator&#13;
low-income countries and 15 Eastern Africa countries indicated that actual&#13;
savings in Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Swaziland, Ethiopia and Somalia were above&#13;
the predicted level (see Figure 3). Actual savings lay below the predicted&#13;
level in Lesotho, Sudan, Botswana, Zaire and Madagascar. We also calculated a&#13;

regression equation for 15 Eastern African countries separately 6/. The&#13;
regression line for Eastern Africa remained below the pooled regression line&#13;
for a substantial range of per capita incomes.&#13;
32.       During the second half of the 1970s, the trend was distinctively&#13;
towards lower domestic saving ratios, particularly in Group II and in Tanzania&#13;
and Sudan from Group I. In the case of copper exporting economies, declining&#13;
saving ratios went hand in hand with a serious deterioration in the terms of&#13;
trade (Figure 4) but this relation did not hold in many other instances. The&#13;
collapse of savings in Ethiopia and Uganda took place despite the rise of&#13;
coffee prices and substantial improvement in terms of trade (Figure 5; also&#13;
see Annex Table 11).&#13;
33.       The reliance of Eastern Africa on external savings to finance its&#13;
investment program has always been high and this has increased (Annex Table&#13;
12). The median ratio of gross national savings to gross national investment&#13;
exceeded 700% only once during this period. In seven out of fourteen countries&#13;
for which data are available for 1977-79, this ratio was below 50%. In Group&#13;
I countries, domestic savings financed only approximately a quarter of total&#13;
investment at the beginning of the period. This proportion had risen to over&#13;
a half by 1973, but it has shown no sustained increase threafter. In Group II&#13;
countries the reliance on domestic resources for investment was much higher at&#13;
6/ It should be stressed that the data base for this exercise is quite weak.&#13;
Apart from the data problems in Africa, savings data on economies such as&#13;
Nepal or Afghanistan are largely conjectural. Even in Bangladesh or India&#13;
savings estimates are not felt to be very accurate. The regression&#13;
equation for the pooled sample was:&#13;
2&#13;
S/Y = 1.06 + 0.0549 y       (R = 0.41) where S = savings, Y = GDP and y =&#13;
per capita GDP. For 15 Eastern Africa countries the equation was:&#13;

S/Y = 4.15 + 0.0609 y       (R = 0.43)&#13;

the beginning of the period, approximately 90%. By 1978 this ratio had fallen&#13;
to almost 55%. Five cases of striking increase in the domestic financing of&#13;
investment can be identified: these are Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Swaziland&#13;
and Botswana. However, all these countries started the period with very low&#13;
or even negative savings rates so that with the exception of Swaziland they&#13;
are still heavily dependent on external capital flows. In Tanzania, Sudan,&#13;
Zaire and Ethiopia the ratio of gross domestic savings to investment has&#13;
declined; the drop is precipitous in the case of the first three countries.&#13;
34.       Most of the external savings in Eastern Africa take the form of&#13;
official development assistance or ODA. Annex Table 13 shows that ODA&#13;
exceeded 50% of external resources inflow in all countries and exceeded 75% in&#13;
11 of them. In earlier years, non-concessional capital flows constituted an&#13;
important source of external capital in Zambia, Zaire, Sudan and Kenya. This&#13;
resulted in a rapid buildup of debt service payments, and in Zaire and Sudan&#13;
it was necessary to negotiate postponement in scheduled debt service&#13;
payments. The role of direct investment has not been of much importance in&#13;
the Eastern African countries, with the exception of Zaire and the countries&#13;
of the Southern African Customs Union. On the basis of the IMF figures,&#13;
direct investment accounted for only 5% to 9% of long-term capital flows to&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa 7/ (Annex Table 14). Even in countries such as Kenya or&#13;
Malawi which have been very receptive to foreign equity capital, net private&#13;
7/ There are major statistical gaps in this area. The two sources of primary&#13;
data, the OECD and the IMF, each suffer from crucial deficiences.     The&#13;
OECD data omit South African investment since it is concerned only with&#13;
the DAC group. The IMF data do not cover Zaire, an important recipient&#13;
country. IMF data also include flows between South Africa and its customs&#13;
union partners originating in the customs union payments provisions. Data&#13;
for the BLS countries are, therefore, not comparable to that of other&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
direct investments have been only 10% to 15% of total long-term capital&#13;
inflows. Moreover, much of the investment is in the form of reinvestment of&#13;
profits by established foreign companies. Besides the mineral producers, only&#13;
Kenya has any substantial stock of foreign capital (Annex Table 16).&#13;
35.       To conclude this section, the supply of investable funds has had a&#13;
considerble influence on the tempo and pattern of capital accumulation.&#13;
Declining national saving rates during the late 1970s affected investment&#13;
adversely and this tendency would have been more pronounced had it not been&#13;
for some offsetting changes in the flow of external funds. ODA from all&#13;
sources to the sample of 16 countries expanded by 7% per annum in real terms&#13;
during 1976-79. Heavy reliance on ODA also emphasizes the vulnerability of&#13;
Eastern Africa in that future investment prospects are intimately tied up with&#13;
what happens to official aid. It is clear that the region is not of&#13;
particular interest to private foreign investors and that considerations of&#13;
creditworthiness will stand in the way of external borrowing on commercial&#13;
terms, except on a limited scale.&#13;
IV. Productivity of Capital&#13;
36.       The deterioration in ICORs has been a widespread phenomena.   In&#13;
trying to understand why this has happened, we will look at the following&#13;
factors:&#13;
-    extent of capacity utilization;&#13;

ICORs;&#13;
-    strains on absorptive capacity; and&#13;
-    impact of government policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Capacity Utilization&#13;
37.       Our hypothesis regarding utilization is that it has fallen sharply,&#13;
partly because of a scarcity of imports. The emergence of idle capacity&#13;
raised ICORs sharply, but this decline in capital productivity is caused not&#13;
so much by the quality of new investment projects as by the economy-wide&#13;
constraint on imports. It follows that ICORs will fall as soon as extra&#13;
foreign exchange is available to purchase critical production inputs.&#13;
38.       Direct evidence to support this hypothesis is scant.     Measurements&#13;
of capacity utilizations are crude and observations over time are seldom&#13;
available. Some statistics are available for Tanzania, Somalia, Sudan, and&#13;
Zambia (Annex Tables 18-23). The Tanzanian figures related to the late 1970s&#13;
and showed capacity utilization varying from a low of 12% in motorcycles and&#13;
bicycles to a high of 94% in tobacco manufactures. There was some tendency&#13;
for utilization to vary inversely with the degree of dependence of the&#13;
activity on imports. In Somalia, however, utilization was low even in&#13;
industries relying on domnestic materials, e.g. meat. Plant capacity had been&#13;
designed with exports in view, but these failed to materialize. In Sudan,&#13;
Zambia and Zaire the import constraint had been much more severe and this had&#13;
affected local farm production; thereby reducing supplies of local and&#13;
imported raw materials to manufacturers.&#13;
39.       No capacity utilization data was available for agriculture, but&#13;
there was no doubt that mechanized agricultural production was severely&#13;
reduced, partly because of the unavailability of imported spare parts or fuel&#13;
for tractors and fertilizers, etc. Events in the Geizera Scheme in the Sudan&#13;
are pertinent in this context. The sharp decline in Geizera cotton should not&#13;
all be attributed to the foreign exchange constraint; there were many other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
factors involved, but unavailability of critical imports was an important part&#13;
of the picture. In Tanzania, the shortage of foreign exchange was partly&#13;
responsible for the collapse of agriculture. Many crops such as wheat, rice,&#13;
sugar, tea, tobacco, sisal and mild coffee rely heavily on imported inputs.&#13;
Even maize grown for the urban market uses a large amount of inputs purchased&#13;
abroad. In addition, transportation of farm output in a country as&#13;
geographically dispersed as Tanzania is very demanding of foreign exchange for&#13;
vehicle parts and fuel.&#13;
40.       We can also cite some evidence at the macro-level on this issue.&#13;
Ideally one would study the relation between the flow of intermediate good&#13;
imports and ICORs but data for this exercise is not available. Instead, we&#13;
have examined the connection between ICORs, total imports and petroleum&#13;
imports. Overall there is some correlation between rising ICORs and declining&#13;
imports. Group II countries have experienced both phenomena in a more&#13;
intensive form than Group I. However, there are cases such as Kenya, and to a&#13;
lesser extent, Malawi, where declines in import coefficients allowed GDP&#13;
growth with a less than proportionate expansion in imports and without a&#13;
sacrifice of productivity. There are also cases such as Somalia and Sudan,&#13;
where capacity utilization problems were evident even in a period when the&#13;
volume of imports was rising significantly. It was difficult in these&#13;
countries to divert foreign exchange earnings to the import of intermediate&#13;
goods, since a sizeable part of these earnings accrued to migrants and did not&#13;
pass through official channels. Remittances from migrant workers typically&#13;
came in the form of non-essential consumer good imports which could be sold in&#13;
local markets at premium prices. Furthermore, a large part of imports were&#13;
financed by external aid tied to capital goods required by new projects and&#13;
not available for purchasing intermediates required for using already&#13;
installed capacity.&#13;

41.       Also significant was the sluggishness or decline in the volume of&#13;
petroleum imports in recent years in several countries. Typically, petroleum&#13;
imports increased much more rapidly than GDP in the late 1960s and early&#13;
1970s. The subsequent slowing down was a major impediment in the efficient&#13;
functioning of the transport network which was the major end-user of oil&#13;
imports. This generated a major setback for many economic activities,&#13;
especially agricultural marketing, in many countries.&#13;
42.       Capacity utilization has also fallen because governments have not&#13;
provided sufficient funds in the recurrent budget to purchase inputs required&#13;
for maintenance and operation of schools, health clinics, roads, agricultural&#13;
research and extension services, etc. Although this generalization was&#13;
supported by field observations of economic and technical analysts familiar&#13;
with Eastern Africa, it was not possible to cite systematic statistical&#13;
evidence for all countries. Faced with budgetary difficulties, governments&#13;
responded by a series of actions during the late 1970s which cumulatively led&#13;
to an anomalous situation, namely underfunding of already completed economic&#13;
assets in the public sector while new projects were being launched.&#13;
43.       Conditions regarding road maintenance are a source of concern in&#13;
most countries, particularly with respect to secondary and feeder roads.&#13;
Underfunding was not the only difficulty but it was a major impediment in&#13;
securing the full benefits of past investments in the road network.&#13;
Similarly, very large capital outlays on primary schools during the 1970s were&#13;
not producing the expected benefits because of inadequate recurrent budget&#13;
provisions. Annex Table 26 shows that real recurrent provisions per primary&#13;
school student declined during 1970-75 by 42% in Uganda, by 41% in Malawi, by&#13;
38% in Madagascar and by 37% in Lesotho.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
44.       We were able to find data on real recurrent budget outlays on&#13;
economic services for only four countries, and even this information is&#13;
subject to many qualifications (Annex Table 28). In the Sudan, the peak was&#13;
reached in 1974; since then recurrent outlays for economic services have been&#13;
falling. In 1979 the index of these outlays had declined by 53 points.&#13;
Similarly, these outlays in Zambia peaked in 1975 and by 1978 they had&#13;
declined by 80 points. Kenyan and Tanzanian data show rising indices, but we&#13;
are not able to determine whether or not these increases were adequate. We do&#13;
know that Tanzanian agriculture has been deprived adequate recurrent budget&#13;
funds, impeding the mobility of research and extension staff and creating&#13;
shortages of needed materials and provisions.&#13;
Sector-Mix and Sectoral ICORs&#13;
45.       The economy-wide ICOR is a weighted average of sectoral ICORs.&#13;
Typically, agriculture has the lowest ratio and this situation persists until&#13;
a rather advanced state of development when agriculture gets increasingly&#13;
mechanized (Kuznets, 1960 and 1961). In Eastern Africa, agricultural ICORs&#13;
are particularly low, reflecting the very low technology and the general&#13;
absence of draft animals and irrigation.&#13;
46.       The upward shift in ICORs can be attributed to some extent to the&#13;
decline in the share of agriculture in investment and output. Available data&#13;
are summarized in the table on page 29. They show a substantial contraction&#13;
in agriculture's share in total capital formation in Burundi, Tanzania and&#13;
Kenya, although many gaps in the statistical series limit their usefulness.&#13;
The contribution of agriculture to GNP also fell in these cases as well as in&#13;
Malawi, Ethiopia, Somalia and Zimbabwe.&#13;

47.       Time series data on sectoral investment and output are not available&#13;
for most countries. We have, nevertheless, tried in two cases to break down&#13;
each sector's contribution to the change in the economy-wide ICOR, using&#13;
Martin Wolf's formula (see Annex II). In the Tanzanian case, the&#13;
decomposition exercise reveals the impact of countervailing sectoral trends&#13;
which more or less offset each other, thereby making for an almost stable&#13;
economy-wide ICOR. The agricultural ICOR declined but this was counteracted&#13;
by a sharp increase in the industrial ICOR. The role of the services sector&#13;
remained unchanged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
48.       The second decomposition exercise for Kenya was based on data which&#13;
is not consistent with that used in this paper. We cite the results,&#13;
nevertheless, simply to illustrate the nature of the calculations.&#13;
Accordingly, ICORs rose in all sectors; the services sector was responsible&#13;
for 64% of the rise in the overall ratio; industry contributed 33% and&#13;
agriculture only 3%.&#13;
Absorptive Capacity&#13;
49.       We have mentioned, earlier (para. 28) that rapid expansion in the&#13;
volume of investment during the late 1960s and 1970s created a number of&#13;
bottlenecks, particularly in the public sector. The supply of skills for&#13;
example, did not keep pace with the growing number of projects started.&#13;
Although a concerted attempt was made to expand enrollment and train available&#13;
personnel, the demand for project staff could not be satisfied in a timely&#13;
fashion. The period witnessed an outflow of colonial officers as part of the&#13;
indigenization drive and after 1973, there was another migration of Somalis&#13;
and Sudanese (including professionals) to the Gulf countries in search of&#13;
attractive salaries.   The local supply of middle- and high-level skills was&#13;
supplemented to some extent by expatriates financed by technical assistance or&#13;
on direct hire. Nevertheless, vacancies persisted and available staff was&#13;
moved from post to post in a desperate attempt to fill gaps. All this was&#13;
well understood among development practitioners familiar with Eastern Africa,&#13;
even though we have not found systematic evidence to buttress these&#13;
impressions.&#13;
50.       In this context it is instructive to examine the experience of the&#13;
World Bank in project implementation during the 1970s. Our focus is on 32&#13;
agricultural projects. In one-fifth of these cases, actual costs were higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
than estimated costs. In no less than half the sample, actual unit costs were&#13;
higher than estimated. In one-third of the sample, the planned project size&#13;
had to be reduced. The reasons for this varied, but stringency of budget&#13;
funds, inability on the part of the governments to set up implementation units&#13;
in time as well as the failure to mobilize project beneficiaries figured&#13;
prominently. In about one-third of the projects, the actual completion time&#13;
substantially exceeded the estimated time. Furthermore, in almost all these&#13;
cases problems relating to administration and staff were partly responsible&#13;
for delays. There were relatively few instances where purely technical or&#13;
natural factors were responsible for the delay in project completion.&#13;
Impact of Government Policy&#13;
51.       It can be argued that a number of structural factors in Eastern and&#13;
Southern Africa countries tend to raise capital costs, compared to say those&#13;
prevailing in the Indian sub-continent. Many Eastern and Southern African&#13;
countries are landlocked and this makes for higher transportation costs.&#13;
Also, they are of small economic size and thereby unable to exploit economies&#13;
of scale and agglomeration. They face a large element of uncertainty, making&#13;
it necessary to hold substantial inventories. Labor, including unskilled&#13;
labor, is relatively more expensive (Gulhati and Sekhar, 1981). And the acute&#13;
scarcity of skills and experience tends to reduce productivity all around. To&#13;
these structural factors should be added the impact of government policy on&#13;
the efficiency of investment. This impact is visible at macro, sectoral and&#13;
project levels, particularly during the latter 1970s, when these economies had&#13;
to confront a substantial deterioration in the international economic climate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
52.       The sharp fall in capacity utilization related to the import squeeze&#13;
in many Eastern and Southern African countries was the result not only of&#13;
declining terms of trade but also of the policy-induced bias against exports&#13;
reflected in the price and exchange rate regimes. In the event, the volume of&#13;
exports declined during 1970-79 in Tanzania, Kenya and Sudan (Group I) as well&#13;
as in Ethiopia, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar and Uganda (Group II) (see World&#13;
Bank, 1981). Their marketing was frequently the sole responsibility of&#13;
parastatals which tended to absorb a growing part of the border price, thereby&#13;
undermining farm incentives. Furthermore, many of these governments opted to&#13;
deal with the pressure on the balance of payments by import restrictions&#13;
rather than by pursuing an active exchange rate policy (Gulhati and&#13;
Autokorala, forthcoming). The scarcity value of foreign exchange was not&#13;
reflected in the payment made to exporters. Those who earned foreign exchange&#13;
by exportation were not rewarded suitably, leading in time to the accentuation'&#13;
of the import constraint, fall in the utilization of capacity and the&#13;
corresponding rise in ICORs.&#13;
53.       The decline in the share of agriculture in investment and output and&#13;
the parallel emphasis on industrialization and urban infrastructure were also&#13;
policy induced to a large extent. While farm prices were regulated at low&#13;
levels, manufactured goods' production was stimulated by raising their prices&#13;
to levels far above those prevailing internationally. For some time this&#13;
strategy produced rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, but this advance&#13;
could not be sustained (Gulhati and Sekhar, 1981). The incentive system was&#13;
tilted in favor of both import and capital-intensive industrialization&#13;
oriented mainly to the home market. The new manufacturers became the victim&#13;
of the economy-wide foreign exchange constraint. Their high costs prevented&#13;
them from selling abroad in order to finance their import needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
54.       Investment activity in the public sector rose at a faster rate than&#13;
in the private sector in many Eastern and Southern African countries (Annex&#13;
Table 27). This was true not only of Ethiopia and Zambia, i.e. socialist&#13;
economies, but also of Burundi and Malawi who remain capitalistic in their&#13;
ideology. At the end of the 1970s, there was scarcely any country in our&#13;
sample in which the share of public investment fell short of 40% of total&#13;
investment in the formal or monetized sector and in several this share was&#13;
much higher. In principle, this public investment was subject to scrutiny via&#13;
the planning, project appraisal and budgeting processes. Since a substantial&#13;
part of public investment was financed with ODA, many of the bigger projects&#13;
were scrutinized by technical and economic staffs of aid agencies. The&#13;
deterioration in the productivity of investment took place despite all these&#13;
ex-ante analyses and supervision missions during the course of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
55.       An examination of 21 agricultural projects in Eastern and Southern&#13;
Africa, financed partly by the World Bank Group, is instructive in this&#13;
context. The weighted average economic rate of return ex-ante was nearly 20%:&#13;
a re-evaluation of these same projects (after construction was completed and&#13;
the flow of benefits had started) resulted in a weighted rate of return&#13;
ex-post of only 12%. Of course, even the latter was an estimate since an&#13;
actual rate of return could be calculated only at the end of the project's&#13;
life. The substantial deterioration in capital productivity captured by these&#13;
ex-ante and ex-post estimates was the result of some combination of&#13;
cost overruns, time delays and scaling down of project benefits.&#13;
&#13;

V. Conclusion&#13;
56.       Now we will try to answer some of the questions listed in the&#13;
introduction:&#13;
-    the relative roles of the investment rate and investment&#13;
productivity in bringing about a retardation in GDP growth;&#13;
-    factors responsible for the declining productivity of investment.&#13;
57.       Nine out of 16 countries in our sample experienced a retardation in&#13;
the growth of GDP. The extent of the setback was relatively minor in Rwanda&#13;
but very large in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zaire and Zambia (see table on page&#13;
35). In Swaziland and Rwanda the setback in GDP growth took place despite a&#13;
large rise in the investment rate: it was entirely due to a decline in the&#13;
return to capital. In Zimbabwe, the investment rate remained more or less&#13;
unchanged and the slowing down in the expansion of GDP was attributable to a&#13;
fall in capital productivity. The last column shows that GDP growth would&#13;
have increased very slightly, if the ICOR had remained constant during the&#13;
1970s. Deterioration in capital productivity was also the dominant factor in&#13;
Zambia, Zaire, Botswana and Uganda. Zambia's GDP growth rate declined by&#13;
seven percentage points, despite a substantial rise in the investment rate.&#13;
In Zaire, Botswana and Uganda the setback was the combined result of falling&#13;
investment and deteriorating capital productivity, but the latter clearly&#13;
played the dominant role. For example, in Zaire, GDP expansion was reduced by&#13;
8.6 percentage points; of this less than one percentage point could be&#13;
explained by the fall in the investment rate (see last column), and the rest&#13;
was attributable to a deterioration in capital productivity. In contrast, the&#13;
decline in the investment rate was exclusively responsible for the setback in&#13;
GDP in Madagascar (which experienced an improvement in capital productivity),&#13;
and it was the major culprit in Ethiopia.&#13;

58.       We cannot assess quantitatively the role of various factors&#13;
contributing to a decline in the productivity of investment. The attempt by&#13;
many countries to raise rapidly the level of overall investment, to&#13;
industrialize and modernize their economies at the expense of agriculture and&#13;
to expand the public sector at a rate which far exceeded the availability of&#13;
relevant professional skills has led to a massive deterioration in the quality&#13;
of projects and the effectiveness of their implementation. Superimposed on&#13;
these factors was the deterioration in the international economic climate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
which made it even more difficult to manage the public finances and the&#13;
foreign exchange budgets, thereby compounding the problems of project&#13;
execution and causing capacity utilization to decline drastically.&#13;
59.       The analysis in this paper is based on data up to 1979.   Systematic&#13;
information is not available for the subsequent period but it is clear that&#13;
economic difficulties facing these countries have multiplied. The retardation&#13;
in GDP growth became even more pronounced in 1980 and 1981. The constraint on&#13;
foreign exchange for the import of intermediate goods remained acute.&#13;
Budgetary pressures made it very difficult to fund recurrent economic needs&#13;
adequately, and so on.&#13;
60.       Economic recovery will necessitate a reconsideration of major&#13;
elements of the economic and institutional policy frame. First, the emphasis&#13;
will have to be on consolidation and rehabilitation rather than on starting&#13;
many new projects. The aim of obtaining a reasonable pay off from already&#13;
completed investments must take precedence over starting new schemes. The&#13;
efficiency of the existing capital stock must be increased before launching&#13;
the next round of capital accumulation. Secondly, the emphasis will have to&#13;
be on reviving traditional agriculture (food plus cash crops), thereby&#13;
securing some relaxation of the constraint on foreign exchange through volume&#13;
increases of exports and reduction of the need for food imports. Once this&#13;
phase is over, attention can be given to the promotion of new crops and&#13;
technological changes to raise yields. A prosperous and dynamic agriculture&#13;
is a good foundation for industrialization, since it provides many inputs for&#13;
manufacturing and since it is also a major consumer of industrial goods. The&#13;
plea to revive and strengthen agriculture should not be viewed as a step&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
detrimental to the industrialization drive of African countries. Finally, the&#13;
recovery program requires institutional adjustments aimed at improving the&#13;
efficiency of the public sector and at expanding its capacity to manage the&#13;
economy.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN THE ICOR, GROWTH RATE,&#13;
INVESTMENT RATIO AND THE INVESTMENT RATE&#13;
The ICOR for the period i to ; is defined as the ratio of invest-&#13;
ment summed over the period i-1 to j-1 to output in period j minus output ir&#13;
period i.&#13;
The ICOR, the rate of growth of output, the investment ratio and&#13;
the rate of investment in Eastern Africa are related to each other.&#13;
It is worthwhile examining some identities.&#13;
Let K = capital stock&#13;
Y = output&#13;
I = investment&#13;
and the operator    indicate changes in each variable.&#13;
Then   AK = ICOR&#13;
Also   &amp;      =  I  I/.                                           i&#13;
,Ay     'A!!Y  =   Y/ y  ............ --  -- -... ..........................  i&#13;
Y y&#13;
This identity states that&#13;
ICOR = investment ratio/growth rate of output&#13;
AlsoAK    AK       K&#13;
y&#13;
or taking logarithms&#13;
log ~K- = logi~K_ log +Y log      K/               .Mi&#13;
8AY =   o-KlgS            + lgKy ................................(i&#13;
K &#13;
Or  log (ICOR) = log (growth rate of capital) - log (growth rate of output)&#13;
+ log (average capital output ratio)!/.&#13;
Thus the ICOR is inversely related to the growth rates of output&#13;
and capital and directly related to the investment ratio. Kuznets (1960),&#13;
1/ See A.A. Walters (1966) and Kazuo Sato (1971) for analysis along similar&#13;
lines.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Kuznets (1961), K. Sato (1971) and J. Vanek and A.H. Studenmund (1968)&#13;
among others have estimated these relations and also other behavioral ones.&#13;
Some of these exercises cannot be replicated for the Eastern Africa sample&#13;
since they involve a knowledge of the rate of depreciation of capital stock&#13;
and net investment magnitudes. Kuznets (op. cit.) found the gross ICOR to&#13;
be significantly related to the growth rate of output as well as per capita&#13;
income. The latter association may be due to the relation between sectoral&#13;
shares in output and income. As incomes rise, the economy generally shifts&#13;
towards a non-agricultural composition of output and ICORs in the non-agri-&#13;
cultural sectors are typically higher than in agriculture. There is, how-&#13;
ever, also capital deepening with development, so that at significantly&#13;
higher levels of income, the ICOR in all sectors may be higher. Sato also&#13;
found in some of his regressions that the share of exports in goods and&#13;
services is related positively to the ICOR. Export items generally require&#13;
more capital in production, processing and transport than goods intended&#13;
for domestic consumption, especially if they are minerals. Overall, how-&#13;
ever, Sato concluded that the relation between various behavioral variables&#13;
and the ICOR was weak in samples consisting exclusively of low income&#13;
countries.&#13;
In the case of the Eastern African countries we are more inter-&#13;
ested in why growth rates of output decreased and the ICOR rose between&#13;
periods rather than in an explanation of the ICOR at a point in time.&#13;
However cross section regressions do reveal some interesting patterns.&#13;
The inverse relation between the ICOR and growth rate, was, we&#13;
have seen valid for Eastern Africa on an intertemporal basis. Output&#13;
growth was lower in the 1973-79 sub-period relative to the 1967-73 one and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
ICORs were on the average higher. The same relation holds cross section-&#13;
ally. The correlation coefficients between ICOR and the growth rate of&#13;
output were -0.35 and -0.82 in the two sub-periods respectively, both&#13;
significant on the basis of the 't' test at the 90 percent level of&#13;
significance.&#13;
The correlation coefficient between ICOR for the 1967-73 sub-&#13;
period and the investment ratio in 1973 was positive and equal to 0.61.&#13;
This was significantly different from zero at the 90 percent level. For&#13;
the sub-period 1973-79 however this coefficient was not significantly dif-&#13;
ferent from zero. This may have been due to the omission of several coun-&#13;
tries from the data set due to their ICORs taking negative values.-/&#13;
Besides the above relations, however, another statistical as-&#13;
sociation was noticed in the data for Eastern Africa. This was an inverse&#13;
association between the ICOR and the growth rate of investment. In the&#13;
1967-73 period this correlation was not significant, though close to it.&#13;
In the 1973-79 period, the correlation coefficient was -0.58 and signifi-&#13;
cant. This relation does not follow from an accounting identity. Evi-&#13;
dently in countries where the ICOR is high, the growth rate of investment&#13;
is low. This may indicate that the high ICORs characterizing the Eastern&#13;
African economies are not merely a transient phenomenon due to the lumpi-&#13;
ness of investment and gestation lags. If that was the case, it is more&#13;
likely that high ICOR levels would be associated positively with the rate&#13;
of growth of investment. However the evidence is too limited to draw any&#13;
strong conclusions.&#13;
1/ A negative ICOR is inadmissible in statistical manipulations as the lower&#13;
the ICOR the more productive is investment, yet a negative ICOR is an&#13;
extreme example of inefficiency of investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
The contribution of each sector to the change in overall ICOR can&#13;
be identified according to the following breakdown given in "Capital&#13;
and Growth in India, 1950-71" by Martin Wolf in World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Paper No. 279. The symbols are from the original.&#13;
Let I = aggregate ICOR&#13;
I = ICOR in sector i&#13;
Ci = Share of sector i in the increment in output IAYi&#13;
AtYJ&#13;
Then the change in ICOR or Al is given by&#13;

But             EACiI    IEACi and&#13;
ZAC = 0 as the incremental shares in output of the sectors&#13;
must cancel each other out and sum to zero.&#13;
Then            AI = EAIiCi + EACi (Ii - I) + EACi i&#13;
Al C  + AC   (I  - I) + AC AI   gives the i    sectors contribution to the overall&#13;
ii   i     i             i    i&#13;
ICOR change.   The first term gives the contribution of the ith sectoral ICOR.&#13;
The second term measures the contribution of the sectoral output increase.-t&#13;
The last is a cross product term.     The details of the exercise for Tanzania&#13;
and Kenya are summarised below. The change in the ICOR from 1967-73 to&#13;
1973-79 was analysed as follows:&#13;
1/ The last term is of the second order of smallness, but its inclusion is&#13;
required as A is a finite rather than an infinitesimal operator.&#13;
2/  This contribution is positive or negative depending on whether the ith&#13;
sectoral ICOR is higher or lower than the overall ICOR.&#13;

ANNEX III&#13;
Limitations of National Account Data in Eastern Africa&#13;
I. General&#13;
In this Annex a number of issues relating to data on the Eastern&#13;
African countries are discussed. An appreciation of these issues will help&#13;
in evaluating the quantitative information presented in this paper as well&#13;
as aid the reader in interpreting data from standard sources on Africa.&#13;
It is generally acknowledged that economic data for Africa are poor.&#13;
It may be well worth supplementing usual national accounts and macro data&#13;
for this region by data generated in response to special surveys over whose&#13;
design and organization the researcher has greater control. Specifically,&#13;
farm management surveys, special sample surveys, small industry survey, etc.,&#13;
spring to mind. The veracity of the data from these sources should compen-&#13;
sate for their lack of economy-wide coverage. Currently there is a paucity&#13;
of such information and reliance has to be placed on national accounts sources&#13;
which are often estimates based on limited evidence. Some improvements have&#13;
been effected but if the goal is to obtain reliable information for research and&#13;
policy design, then a much heavier emphasis on data upgrading is required.&#13;
Currently, published African data seem to suffer from the following&#13;
drawbacks.&#13;
(a)       Many estimates are derived from a few verifiable indi-&#13;
cators. For instance overall investment is sometimes derived from&#13;
imports of capital goods. Price indices may be obtained from the&#13;
prices of a handful of commodities in the capital city using very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
ANNEX III&#13;
outdated weights. Import or export statistics may omit any ad-&#13;
justment for smuggling when this is recognized to be a major&#13;
phenomenon. Consequently though a mass of statistics may be avail-&#13;
able in the standard UN format, there is no guarantee that this&#13;
information represents the real world or is comparable across&#13;
countries. In the shakiest of cases the information simply does&#13;
not accord with qualitative evidence or the experience of observers&#13;
on the scene.&#13;
(b)       The presence of overvalued exchange rates, multiple&#13;
exchange rate practices and unreliable price indices makes constant&#13;
price comparisons as well as cross country comparisons in terms of,&#13;
say, United States dollars dubious. Trend analysis fares better than&#13;
any comparison of absolute magnitudes.&#13;
(c)       Data are often volatile from year to year to an extent&#13;
which casts doubt on their reliability. The procedure adopted in this&#13;
paper has been to take three year averages centered around the re-&#13;
porting year whenever possible in order to minimize this effect.-/&#13;
Data are also reported at short intervals so as not to miss&#13;
cycles.    We have tried not to draw any inference unless data&#13;
for several years confirmed an event.&#13;
1/ If the period to be analyzed was very short then this procedure has not&#13;
been followed. Use of a moving average results in the omission of a&#13;
number of years at the end palats and Ie "et practic&amp;l for short series.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX III&#13;
II. Country Specific Notes&#13;
While national accounts data for most African countries suffer&#13;
from deficiencies, the series for Sudan, Tanzania and Somalia are even more&#13;
suspect than others.  In the case of Sudan the national authorities claim&#13;
that the series for the seventies and the sixties are not comparable. They&#13;
have also stopped releasing national income estimates in constant prices.&#13;
In the case of Tanzania, the national accounts estimate of a growth rate&#13;
of 8.8 percent per annum for subsistence production in the seventies is&#13;
considered implausible. The aggregate growth estimates in this paper as-&#13;
sume that the subsistence sector has only grown at a rate of 4.3 percent&#13;
per annum. For Somalia, while World Bank data files show a growth rate of&#13;
7.4 percent per annum in the 1973-78 Deriod. lntpr information esti-&#13;
mates the growth rate to have been only about 2.5 percent between 1972 and&#13;
1978. There are no official national accounts and virtually no primary&#13;
data base, but the economy appears to be in general stagnation.&#13;

            Capital accumulation in Eastern and
            Southern Africa : a decade of setbacks

        <abstracts>
            This paper attempts to analyze the
            magnitude of the setback in capital accumulation in Eastern
            and Southern Africa and the proximate causes of this
            phenomenon. The sample consists of 16 countries and
            available data for the late 1960s and 1970s are explored.
            Given the weakness of the statistics, the authors rely more
            on expert observations than on rigorous quantitative
            assessments; available data are analyzed, however. Capital
            formation increased fairly rapidly during 1967-1974 but then
            slowed down considerably. Investment was financed to a
            considerable extent by external concession assistance; rapid
            growth in such funds during the late 1970s helped offset
            declining national savings rates to some extent. The setback
            in investment rates was greatly accentuated by a large and
            widespread deterioration in the productivity of capital
            brought about by the impact of government policy, strained
            absorptive capacity and a variety of exogenous factors.
