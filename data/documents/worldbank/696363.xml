EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A: BACKGROUND&#13;
The extent of landmine contamination&#13;
1.    Landmine contamination is a problem for all aspects of reconstruction and community&#13;
development in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mines have been used by all sides during more than&#13;
three years of violent conflict, and are, in general, likely to be found in a band of contamination&#13;
about 5 km wide along former confrontation lines. Estimates of the number of landmines range&#13;
from 1.5 million to 3 million. Nearly all of the mines are of ex-Yugoslavian origin, and many&#13;
are made mostly of plastic, making them difficult to detect and likely to remain dangerous for as&#13;
long as a century. The region is also littered with unused bulk ammunition, much of which is&#13;
now in very poor condition. All areas that were considered strategically significant are potential&#13;
sites for mines, including roads and mountain trails, roads, bridges, railways, forests, villages,&#13;
and agricultural land. Mines have been used to deny access to facilities of all kinds, and to&#13;
hinder the reconstruction of roads and bridges, and the restoration of power supplies, water, gas&#13;
and railways. Many of the existing minefield maps and records are unreliable, many minefields&#13;
have not been mapped, and some areas have been mined and re-mined by both sides, in patterns&#13;
which make subsequent detection difficult. Furthermore, mines move with soil erosion and&#13;
mines laid near rivers will eventually float in the water; thus mines laid near rivers will&#13;
eventually be washed downstream into previously uncontaminated areas. Clearing all the mines&#13;
will take years, probably decades, and will be very costly.&#13;
2.    UNHCR carried out a general needs assessment survey in June 1994 in 41 communities&#13;
in nine regions of Central Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bihac (covering about 20,000 people in&#13;
about 5,000 households).  Results of the survey show landmine incidents in 36 of the&#13;
communities, the highest in Zenica. More than 12% of households were affected in Gornji&#13;
Vakuf, Vares and Zenica; and agricultural production was affected in 17 of the 41 communities.&#13;
Access to land in these areas is estimated to have been reduced by 20 to 50% because of mines.&#13;
Current mine clearing activity.&#13;
3.    Under the Dayton Agreement, the ex-combatants are required to clear their own&#13;
minefields from the Zone of Separation (ZOS) or other areas from which their forces are&#13;
withdrawn, and to carry out minefield marking. However, complete clearance within the ZOS&#13;
cannot be accomplished within the Dayton time framework. Priority is being given to&#13;
mineclearing in support of infrastructure reconstruction needs, but the exercise is unlikely to&#13;
cover all the priority sites. Until very recently (March, 1996), all areas cleared under the&#13;
agreement were cleared to military, rather than civilian ('humanitarian'), standards and will&#13;
require verification (see Appendix 1 -- Notes on Mine Clearing Techniques and Technology).&#13;
Despite the efforts to date, the majority of mines remain, and a major clearance effort is now&#13;
required. Some mines remain even in the areas that have been cleared to a military level, and&#13;
these areas will need verification to bring them to a civilian safety level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Existing institutions and landmine-clearing capacity&#13;
4.    While the need for mine-clearing is urgent, and precedes the need for infrastructure&#13;
reconstruction, the institutional arrangements for dealing with this new problem are not yet fully&#13;
established. The Ministry of Spacial Planning and Environment was designated as the ministry&#13;
responsible for civilian mine-clearing in the Federation, and a mine-clearing agency has been&#13;
established for this purpose in RS. A Mine Protection and Removal Agency (MPRA) has&#13;
recently been established at the state level; initial staff have established a working relationship&#13;
with the Mine Action Center (MAC, which was established under UN auspices -- paras. 13-15).'&#13;
Together they should serve as a focus for all mine-related activity in Bosnia until the means and&#13;
the timing of a complete transition to Bosnian ownership have been worked out.&#13;
5.    The landmine contamination problem will require a long-term clearance effort involving&#13;
a large number of mine-clearers, possibly over 2,500. Bosnian UXO disposal experts have been&#13;
responding to emergency calls throughout the war and the police continue to respond to such&#13;
calls. There are also soldiers who have military mine-clearing experience. There are, however,&#13;
very few commercial companies which have all the requirements (technical, managerial, and&#13;
implementation skills, and capital) that allow them to respond to the need for civilian mine-&#13;
clearing. (i.e. de-mining to humanitarian standards). Moreover, although the needs are large,&#13;
resources to turn this need into effective demand are lacking.&#13;
Consequences for reconstruction and recovery.&#13;
6.    In all the areas where there have been hostilities, particularly where there has not been&#13;
continual presence of civilians, there is a risk of accidents and deaths from mines, unexploded&#13;
ordnance, and booby traps. Booby traps are particularly likely to be found in areas where there&#13;
has been a transfer of territorial control between ex-combatants, and is of substantial concern in&#13;
Sarajevo itself. In the absence of comprehensive mine awareness, minefield marking, and mine-&#13;
clearing, landmine incidents are likely to increase as freedom of movement increases. The&#13;
return of displaced people and refugees, which is anticipated to gather momentum in the spring,&#13;
lends added urgency to the problem. The UNHCR's planning figure for assistance during 1996&#13;
includes about 870,000 people returning to, or relocating within, Bosnia and Herzegovina during&#13;
the year.&#13;
7.    Landmine contamination around major infrastructure facilities is already causing delays&#13;
in reconstruction. Landmines are suspected in several stretches of power transmission lines, gas&#13;
lines, on railway lines, along the edges of roads, on and around bridges and facilities such as&#13;
power stations, etc. Landmines and booby traps are also suspected in some of the areas of the&#13;
district heating network in Sarajevo. Access to these and other sites for survey and design work&#13;
is constrained in many cases because of the known or suspected presence of minefields.&#13;
I A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the Federation has also recently been established. This would be&#13;
located physically within the MPRA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B.   STRATEGY TO CLEAR LANDMINES&#13;
Reconstruction and the Landmine Program&#13;
8.    As part of a coordinated effort of the Government and the international community, the&#13;
Bank assisted in preparing a reconstruction program (in energy, water and waste management,&#13;
transport, telecommunications, agriculture, industry, education, health, housing, and clearing of&#13;
landmines) totaling about US$5 billion equivalent over the next three to four years. Clearing&#13;
landmines and unexploded ordnance is an integral part of this international effort, and is roughly&#13;
estimated to cost about $200 million over the whole period. The reconstruction program was&#13;
presented at donors' conferences, starting in Brussels in December, 1995.&#13;
9.   In January 1996, the Ministry of Spacial Planning and the Environment prepared a draft&#13;
outline of a long term program - "Program of Land Mine Clearing, Protection against Mines and&#13;
Other Unexploded Ordnance Remaining after the War on the Territory of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina". The program's objectives are the efficient reduction of the risks and of the&#13;
suffering caused by landmines and restoration of normal living and working conditions in Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina. Recognizing the long-term nature of the problem, the program recognized the&#13;
need for a heavy reliance on effective protection methods (mine-awareness education, and&#13;
marking of some of the mine-fields for future clearance in the near to medium term. Some of the&#13;
guiding principles agreed with the Government were that the program would be under civilian&#13;
control, and that it would take an integrated view of the needs over the whole territory of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina: if the problem is addressed in a piece-meal fashion, duplication or gaps in&#13;
mine-clearing may occur, resulting in extra costs -- or worse still, unnecessary casualties in the&#13;
civilian population. The program therefore requires cooperation between entities.&#13;
10.  It is also understood by all concerned that a program to clear landmines therefore has to&#13;
be closely coordinated with the overall reconstruction and economic recovery program and&#13;
efforts to reintegrate displaced people. It also has to be carried out according to agreed&#13;
procedures for establishing priorities. The importance of making maximum use of existing&#13;
Bosnian resources both within the institutions responsible for mine-related activities, and in&#13;
terms of mine-clearing capacity, has been stressed by the Bosnian authorities; however, there is a&#13;
recognition of the need for some initial international financial and technical assistance.&#13;
11.   There is general agreement that, although some core public capacity would be needed to&#13;
respond to urgent calls, most of the demining would be carried out under competitive contracting&#13;
by trained mine clearers in private companies. The widespread nature of the landmine problem&#13;
should provide some opportunity for small scale enterprises, and should generate employment&#13;
which may be particularly suitable for demobilized soldiers. All these guiding principles for the&#13;
landmine program were discussed and agreed at an early stage with both entities.&#13;
12.   The main elements of the program for clearing landmines have been outlined and agreed&#13;
with the responsible ministry or agency in each entity during project preparation; i.e., with the&#13;
Ministry of Spacial Planning and Environment (MSPE) in the Federation, and the mine-clearing&#13;
agency in RS. The agreed program elements include: establishing the institutions needed to&#13;
address all aspects of the landmine problem (a central unit and regional offices); carrying out&#13;
mine awareness and training programs, mine surveys and minefield marking; mine clearance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
disposal; mine management training; and safety monitoring and quality assurance.  The&#13;
program's objectives are the efficient protection against mines and restoration of normal living&#13;
and working conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Recognizing the long-term nature of the&#13;
problem, there will be a heavy reliance on effective protection methods (mine-awareness&#13;
education -- "learning to live with landmines") in the near to medium term.&#13;
Coordinated international response&#13;
13.   The international community has expressed a great deal of interest in assisting Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina to address the landmine problem. In view of the current political situation, the&#13;
urgency of the problem, and the number of different agencies and entities involved, it was&#13;
agreed at a meeting in mid-February, called by the Office of the High Representative, that a&#13;
group should be established under the auspices of the OHR. This group, the Mine Clearance&#13;
Policy Group (MCPG) is now part of a temporary structure for launching and implementing a&#13;
mine-clearing program, and would facilitate the coordination of international assistance, and&#13;
foster inter-entity coordination. The Mine Action Center (MAC), under the auspices of the&#13;
UN, and working together with the Government, serves as the focal point for all mine-related&#13;
activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This structure of the MCPG and the MAC has been in&#13;
place for several months and has the support of the international community. However, the&#13;
structure is temporary, and its functions should be placed entirely within the Government's own&#13;
structure at the earliest feasible time.&#13;
14.   The MCPG includes representatives of the Government (State, Federation, and Republika&#13;
Srpska), and of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the European&#13;
Union, the World Bank, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and IFOR. Some&#13;
international NGOs also attend meetings as observers. The MCPG meetings concentrate on&#13;
coordination between international agencies and government, on inter-entity determination of&#13;
priorities, coordination, and arbitration. The MCPG is a forum for discussion and facilitation: it&#13;
is not a permanent institution, and will meet only until the objective of assisting the&#13;
transformation to a Government-owned structure is complete.&#13;
15.   The MAC has recently been established in the Sarajevo area to advise the Government.&#13;
Its functions will be to manage the mine information system, coordinate the mine awareness&#13;
programs, mine survey and minefield marking, training, and mine-clearing activities; and&#13;
establish and monitor safety and quality assurance standards. Initially, international advisers are&#13;
playing a key role in establishing the MAC and its functions, but as the means and timing of the&#13;
transition into a Bosnian Government structure are worked out, the international advisers' role&#13;
will diminish. A Mine Protection and Removal Agency (MPRA) has recently been established at&#13;
the State level, initial staff have already established a working relationship with the MAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
C: FIRST YEAR PROGRAM&#13;
16.   The Mine Action Program. The program is a long-term one, with some components&#13;
lasting for years, possibly decades. The components of the agreed program include:&#13;
a) The establishment of the institutions needed to address all aspects of the landmine&#13;
problem (a central unit and regional offices);&#13;
b) The establishment of a mine contamination data base;&#13;
c) Programs to protect vulnerable populations, such as mine awareness, mine survey and&#13;
minefield marking;&#13;
d) Specialist mine clearing in support of the high priority infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
projects in the overall reconstruction program;&#13;
e) Capacity building, i.e., training and other assistance to expand the Bosnian mine-&#13;
clearing capacity;&#13;
f) Additional mine-clearing in support of community priorities (local infrastructure and&#13;
facilities); and&#13;
g) Establishing of a capacity to monitor spending, contractor progress, and safety&#13;
standards, and carry out Quality Assurance (QA).&#13;
Program Objectives&#13;
17.   The objectives of the program are to protect vulnerable groups until mines in their&#13;
communities can be cleared, and to clear mines in support of priority reconstruction, economic&#13;
recovery, and the restoration of essential public services.&#13;
Program Description&#13;
18.   In order to achieve these objectives, all elements of the program need to be established,&#13;
and a multi-track approach is indicated. Four areas of activity need to be tackled simultaneously:&#13;
(i) setting up the necessary institutions and functions to sustain the program; (ii) protecting&#13;
vulnerable groups; (iii) increasing local landmine-clearing capacity; and (iv) carrying out urgent&#13;
mine-clearing.&#13;
19.   The overall landmine clearing program's first year priority activities are:-&#13;
a) Institutional development: Setting up the institutional structure and getting it fully&#13;
operational will include establishing the mine information management system, and&#13;
establishing the capacity to coordinate all mine-related activities, supervise mine-&#13;
clearing, oversee operating and safety standards, and carry out quality assurance&#13;
(QA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
b) Mine awareness: National mine awareness programs have been in place for some&#13;
time, and are assisted by UN agencies and NGOs who specialize in this area. A&#13;
major new effort is now needed, targeting specific vulnerable groups. Programs will&#13;
be coordinated through the MPRA/MAC.&#13;
c) Increasing Local Mine-Clearing Capacity: A training program is being designed.&#13;
It would accommodate common training, safety, and operating standards which can&#13;
be set and monitored by the Government. However, there will be a need to train&#13;
students from both entities, and discussion is under way as to how best to handle this&#13;
requirement. Existing training capacity would be used to the extent feasible, but&#13;
would be augmented by additional equipment and by technical assistance in the form&#13;
of instructors.&#13;
d) Urgent mine clearing: As necessary as the institutional arrangements and mine&#13;
awareness programns are, they do not remove landmines. Mine clearing needs to be&#13;
carried out as soon as possible in support of urgent reconstruction and recovery&#13;
priorities. Within the first year, some of these contracts will be carried out by&#13;
2&#13;
international companies, but these should be limited .  The procedures for&#13;
determining priorities are established; and much of the mine-clearing in support of&#13;
major infrastructure has already been identified. Reconstruction of local networks and&#13;
other community priorities (hospitals, schools, housing, etc.) is an equally important&#13;
part of the overall reconstruction and recovery of Bosnia, and a reasonable balance&#13;
needs to be struck between the two.&#13;
The program elements are discussed in more detail below.&#13;
(a) Setting up the institutional structure&#13;
20.   The MAC headquarters in Sarajevo, working in cooperation with MPRA, will be the&#13;
main contact point for all other mine-related agencies as well as the focal point for all mine-&#13;
related activity. It should have an appropriate size to perform the task in a cost effective manner,&#13;
relying heavily on the regional offices. The organizational structure is shown in Appendix 2.&#13;
MAC will, on behalf of Government: manage the mine information system; coordinate mine&#13;
awareness programs, as well as mine survey, minefield marking, and mine-clearing activities;&#13;
and establish and monitor safety and quality assurance standards. The operations would be&#13;
heavily dependent on several regional offices for information on locations and data on landmines&#13;
and unexploded ordnance. An important part of MAC's work will be assisting the Government&#13;
through advice on contracting and supervision of contracts.&#13;
21.   The UN has initiated the recruitment of 11 staff (5 international and 6 local). The first&#13;
UN- supported MAC staff (chief demining adviser) arrived in Sarajevo in early March, 1996.&#13;
The USG indicates that it now has committed funding of about $8.5 million for additional&#13;
2 Mine clearing in support of the first few months of the reconstruction program in the roads and bridges, railways,&#13;
power, gas, and district heating sectors is being handled through expedited contracting procedures, and is not&#13;
financed under this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
support to the MAC. The total staff in headquarters and three initial regional offices is planned&#13;
to number 109, of which 16 would be internationally recruited; the other 93 would be Bosnian.&#13;
The US support will also cover office furniture and equipment, vehicles, and supplies. The&#13;
interim MAC is now located in temporary headquarters, and is quickly becoming functional. A&#13;
permanent MAC headquarters building is to be provided by Government, and a suitable location&#13;
is being sought in the Sarajevo area. It is likely, however, that because of the condition of many&#13;
of the buildings, the cost of refurbishing would need to be provided by the international&#13;
community. IFOR has indicated an interest in assisting. The specialist expatriate MAC staff&#13;
would be replaced by qualified Bosnian staff as quickly as is practicable. The costs of the&#13;
Bosnian staff over the first year are included in the program.&#13;
22.   Establishing the mine information data base will be an early activity of the MAC.&#13;
Information on the locations of mined areas is needed for planning and setting priorities for mine&#13;
clearance and mine awareness activities, and for the mine clearance itself. A mine data base was&#13;
originally set up under UNPROFOR at the Mine Action Center in Zagreb, subsequently&#13;
supplemented with the information from the mine maps from the ex-combatants, using the UN&#13;
hardware and software, by the Engineer Branch of NATO (IFOR) as mine information became&#13;
available under the Dayton Agreement. This data base, together with the hardware and software,&#13;
should be transferred to Bosnian control as soon as possible, to be held in the MAC -- the center&#13;
for all mine information in Bosnia. The data will be available to all users, and will be&#13;
continuously upgraded as new information becomes available from the survey and clearance&#13;
programs, and other sources such civil defense, police, and medical authorities. Computers for&#13;
the PC-based mine information management system are being provided with USG funding; the&#13;
software to be installed will include MAPINFO, in order to be compatible with the existing data&#13;
base, and with the system in Croatia. The initial mine information data base is planned to be&#13;
installed in May, 1996 (Timing for the various program components is shown in Appendix 3-&#13;
Implementation Schedule).&#13;
23.   Not all the maps and records obtained from the ex-combatant armies are accurate, and the&#13;
information is not comprehensive. There are likely to be many mined areas not recorded or&#13;
mapped. Some survey work will therefore be necessary prior to defining each mine-clearing task&#13;
or contract to confirm the extent of certain mined areas. The MAC would coordinate this survey&#13;
activity in conjunction with its mine-clearing and mine information functions; and the mine&#13;
information data base would be updated with the results of each survey and mine-clearing&#13;
operation.&#13;
(b) Protecting vulnerable population groups&#13;
24.   People living in mined areas, and refugees and internally displaced people, cannot wait&#13;
until all mines have been removed. It is widely recognized in Bosnia and Herzegovina that&#13;
landmine clearing is a long-term program, and that it is necessary to "leam to live with&#13;
landmines". The Government, together with a number of international organizations and NGOs,&#13;
has been carrying out mine awareness programs for some time, and the population is, in general,&#13;
''mine aware". A new initiative is now needed to ensure that as freedom of movement increases,&#13;
and population reintegration programs get under way, the messages are tailored specifically for&#13;
the most vulnerable groups, e.g., children, returning families, etc. The programs should be&#13;
focussed both in areas where refugees and displaced people are currently located, but also in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
places to which they will eventually return. It is essential that these campaigns are consistent in&#13;
approach and content, and all programs should be coordinated through the MAC, whose mine&#13;
awareness officer is already in place. It is important to know whether existing programs are&#13;
effective in reaching their targeted population groups; evaluation of existing programs should be&#13;
carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible, in order to facilitate design of new initiatives;&#13;
and assess the particular needs of vulnerable groups. All new programs should be followed by an&#13;
evaluation to make sure they are effective. The Government, in consultation with the MAC, will&#13;
be designing and implementing these initiatives over the next few months.&#13;
(c) Increasing Local Mine-Clearing Capacity.&#13;
25.   Experience in other countries has shown that some degree of specialist training is needed&#13;
before humanitarian mine clearance teams can be fielded, despite the existing training in&#13;
explosive ordnance removal and the experience gained during the conflict. In addition to the&#13;
mine-clearing itself, this would include training for team leaders and supervisors, survey&#13;
specialists, mine awareness instructors, dog handlers, and operational and logistic management&#13;
staff. Although this is an urgent activity, it is essential that the training program be well-&#13;
designed and linked to a structure which will effectively deploy trained mine clearers after their&#13;
training course, in order to avoid some of the costly errors that have been made in other countries&#13;
(Appendix 4 -- Lessons from Mine Clearance Projects). Where large numbers of trained mine-&#13;
clearers cannot be employed, many opt for other jobs, and their skills (and sometimes also their&#13;
equipment) is lost. The student output has to match the demand for mine-clearing. Mine-&#13;
clearing demand will depend on how effectively priorities can be identified and agreed (para.&#13;
28), and on the availability of international funding.&#13;
26.   There is general agreement that, although some core public capacity would be needed to&#13;
respond to urgent calls, most of the demining would be carried out under competitive contracting&#13;
by trained mine clearers, organized in companies. Expanding the Bosnian mine clearing capacity&#13;
will therefore require some training in managing mine-clearing teams and companies, as well as&#13;
training of an initial core in the specialist skills of humanitarian de-mining. It is estimated that at&#13;
least 2,000 mine clearers will be needed in the first three years alone, together with about 75&#13;
managerial and administrative staff. The final size of the Bosnian mine-clearing capacity will be&#13;
determined on financial rather than operational factors. Since the entities have expressed&#13;
willingness to train and work together, a central training organization, allowing greater&#13;
Government control of standards, would be the most cost-effective solution. However, facilities&#13;
in both entities may be more acceptable initially. Small scale local level training will also be&#13;
carried out in two or three locations, at a pilot level, and experience from these (e.g., in&#13;
incorporating the necessary medical support and business management skills into the training&#13;
program, and in setting up local companies) will be valuable for the design of the larger program&#13;
(see Appendix 5 for terms of reference for a local pilot program). No funding is committed yet&#13;
for the training program, although the EU is considering a proposal to fund, inter alia, some&#13;
initial school facilities and training and equipping of 200 de-miners.&#13;
27.   Next steps: It is urgent to move forwards quickly because of the lead-time needed to get&#13;
the training facilities operational, and the constraints imposed by the weather -- mine-clearing is&#13;
dangerous under snowy or icy conditions. The potential site(s) needs to be investigated, and if,&#13;
acceptable, needs to be refurbished as necessary; planning for the training program can proceed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
in parallel. Concepts for a training program are being discussed with the Government and the&#13;
MAC. Entity governments will identify potential instructors to be trained in humanitarian mine&#13;
clearing methodology; and suggest ways to inform potential students about the opportunities for&#13;
mine clearance and management. The potential for assisting the development of new Bosnian&#13;
mine-clearing companies through provision of credit, and general management training, etc. (new&#13;
business services) through other World Bank projects is being investigated. Most importantly,&#13;
the finding needs to be confirmed. The training plan should be presented to the donor&#13;
community for possible finding of training facilities and equipment, instructors, operating costs,&#13;
and some support for trainees.&#13;
(d) Priority mine clearing&#13;
28.   Some mine-clearing is needed prior to most, if not all, of the infrastructure repair or&#13;
rehabilitation works to be carried out within the first year of the overall reconstruction program.&#13;
MSPE has, in coordination with the various sector ministries and agencies, outlined a&#13;
coordinated program of such priority needs for major infrastructure in the Federation (Appendix&#13;
6). This program will be an important input in setting overall priorities for the country. The&#13;
status of coordination of local priorities within RS needs to be reviewed. It is expected that local&#13;
priorities, determined at the local level, will be coordinated at the entity level. Until a national-&#13;
level agency is fully functional, the MCPG would coordinate the inter-entity aspects of mine-&#13;
clearance priority setting and coordination, relying on the Ministry of Spacial Planning and the&#13;
Environment, and the RS mine clearing agency, for intra-entity priorities. Programs in other&#13;
countries have shown a tendency of major infrastructure to receive a large proportion of the total&#13;
mine-clearing attention, effort, and resources, at the expense of these local priorities. A reasonable&#13;
balance needs to be struck between the two. It is important to ensure that the balance is maintained&#13;
beyond the first-year program. Local priorities can be more complex in terms of organization and&#13;
implementation. Given the long-term nature of the mine pollution problem, it is essential that&#13;
community-level mine action programs be considered a key aspect of the de-mining program, and&#13;
be included in the planning, implementation and evaluation of the program.&#13;
29.   The most urgent of the mine-clearing in support of priority infrastructure reconstruction is&#13;
being financed under the Emergency District Heating, Gas, and Transport Reconstruction&#13;
Projects. The Government is anxious to keep external contracting to a minimum. Mine clearing&#13;
works will be grouped in relatively small packages, and are expected to be suitable for the newly&#13;
emerging Bosnian mine-clearing capacity. The status of the initial planned landmine-related&#13;
contracts is shown in Appendix 7. Quality assurance will need to be carried out for all the mine-&#13;
clearing contracts. Initially this will need to be done by contract. Draft TORs for a QA contract&#13;
are shown in Appendix 8.&#13;
30.   Mine clearance within communities will be in response to local priorities. This could&#13;
entail clearing houses and community areas in support of the return or resettlement of displaced&#13;
people. In these situations, the clearing of booby traps and unexploded ordnance is likely to be as&#13;
important as the clearing of landmines. A pilot project of this nature, involving some de-mining&#13;
training in Tuzla and clearing of housing in priority areas, starting with Gradacac, has been&#13;
proposed by Norwegian Peoples' Aid. In some cases, the priority may be demining of local&#13;
infrastructure facilities. MSPE is preparing a proposal for a pilot project of this nature in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
town of Olovo,3 which also involves training of local de-miners, for funding under the Dutch&#13;
grant.&#13;
31.   There may be other clearance needs, e.g. emergency clearance in support of returning&#13;
refugees and displaced people, clearance of hospitals, schools, etc., that may require small&#13;
emergency clearance teams that are able to address immediate tasks in a quick and flexible&#13;
manner. These teams could work from the regional offices to be established under the MAC, and&#13;
could be provided by a contractor or an NGO. The provision should include the necessary&#13;
equipment and medical support. The US is considering supporting these teams together with its&#13;
support to the MAC and the first three regional offices.&#13;
Program Costs and Financing&#13;
32.   Details of the estimated program costs and the financing plan are shown in Appendix 9.&#13;
The total program cost is about $67 million equivalent. The IDA Credit would provide about&#13;
11% of the total requirement on IDA terms. The rest would come from contributions in kind,&#13;
cofmancing and/or parallel financing from donors. In addition to funds made available by the&#13;
Netherlands Government for financing project preparation and pilot projects and the resources&#13;
committed for mine awareness, firm commitments for the landmine-clearing program so far have&#13;
been made by the UN,4 the EU, Italy, Sweden, the US, and Norwegian Peoples' Aid. Several&#13;
other donors, including Belgium, Canada, and Denmark, have indicated amounts or expressed&#13;
interest. Funds already committed or indicated amount to more than $50 million. Additional&#13;
donor funding is being sought. It is envisaged that the highest demand on funds would take&#13;
place in the first two years. Support during this period would provide a good foundation for the&#13;
Government's long-term mine-clearing program, which may have to continue for some time&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
33.   The IDA funds would mostly be used to finance mine-clearing contracts; however,&#13;
should there be a shortage of funds for other key items, project design will allow IDA financing&#13;
of these critical items. These would be a small proportion of the total, and would be limited, by&#13;
and large, to technical assistance, running costs and key equipment.&#13;
34.   The MAC is being supported through the UN, with funding from  several donors,&#13;
particularly the United States. Several international and local staff are already in place. The&#13;
MAC is now functional, but with a minimum staff. It is expected that all key positions will be&#13;
staffed and three regional offices will be functional by the end of the summer.  MAC&#13;
headquarters is now in a temporary location, and a permanent location will eventually be&#13;
provided by the Government. During the first year, MAC headquarters and regional office staff&#13;
will be strengthened to the extent possible, but committed funding will support only a very&#13;
minimum institutional structure for one year, and is not sufficient to fully equip the three&#13;
3A pilot housing project, also to be funded under the Dutch grant, is proposed for Olovo. Olovo may be typical of&#13;
many towns in Bosnia, in that it has to tackle the problems of damaged housing at the same time as the lack of&#13;
employment (the local industries either suffered loss and/or damage, and/or have no utility supplies). In the case of&#13;
Olovo, housing repair and clearing minefields around power lines are identified as high priorities&#13;
4Japan is contributing through the United Nations, as is Denmark; the EU may also contribute $2.2 million of a&#13;
total $16.8 million through the UN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
regional offices (e.g., with mine-protected vehicles) and to expand the number of regional&#13;
offices. Additional funding is needed in order to attain the optimum number and staffing of&#13;
regional offices.&#13;
35.   Mine awareness is already supported to some extent by the various agencies involved,&#13;
including, for example, ICRC, and UNICEF, as well as the Bosnian Government. Additional&#13;
resources, technical and financial, are needed. Funding for the training program is not yet fully&#13;
committed, although there has been some interest expressed by two potential funding sources.&#13;
Some project preparation, institutional development and capacity building cost will be supported&#13;
by an IDA Project Preparation Facility in the amount of US$0.75 million. The Government of&#13;
Italy has committed about $4 million for landmine clearing in designated priority towns.&#13;
Additional funding is needed for mine clearing, in support of reconstruction of both major&#13;
infrastructure and local priorities. Several donors, including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the&#13;
EU, have not yet made a final determination as to which part of the landmine clearing program&#13;
they would support.&#13;
36.  The program components to be supported by the World Bank take into account the&#13;
potential contributions, in terms of financial or technical support, of the international&#13;
organizations, donor countries, and NGOs. The Bank's emphasis would be on providing&#13;
assistance for the fourth component -- urgent mine-clearing, in support of reconstruction and&#13;
recovery priorities (major infrastructure and local priorities), including financing mine clearing&#13;
contracts.  However, project design will remain flexible to include funding for essential&#13;
components, should other financing sources not materialize in a timely manner. In particular, the&#13;
training program requires assured support. Likewise, some technical assistance for specialist&#13;
support to the Government would also need to be included. By providing financing for mine-&#13;
clearing contracts and, if necessary, for the institutional and training components, the project&#13;
would ensure the core technical and managerial skills needed over the first year. This would,&#13;
however, mean that fewer resources may be available for landmine clearing. The speed of&#13;
implementation of the mine clearing component will depend on the presence of these core skills,&#13;
as well as on the resources available.&#13;
37.   Flow of Funds. The State would be the borrower for the IDA funds, and would make the&#13;
funds available to the Federation and to the Srpska Republic for implementation within the&#13;
entities. Subsidiary lending and implementation arrangements would be agreed between the&#13;
State and the Federation, and between the State and RS.&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
38.   The newly established MPRA would work with the responsible agencies within the&#13;
Federation and the RS to implement the project. Detailed arrangements were agreed at&#13;
negotiations, and in a follow-up letter (Appendix 11); these arrangements will be outlined in the&#13;
subsidiary financing and implementation agreements between the state (BH) and the Federation,&#13;
and between BH and RS. Entity priorities for mine-clearing will be determined within the&#13;
entities; these would be collated by the MAC/MPRA, and any problems in inter-entity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
coordination would be resolved by the MCPG. The entity agencies (the MSPE in the Federation,&#13;
and the mine-clearing agency in RS) are already collaborating with the MAC on determining&#13;
mine-clearing tasks in accordance with the priorities. Government institutions responsible for&#13;
mine-clearing would receive some technical assistance as required to help them carry out their&#13;
managerial responsibilities, but have agreed during negotiations to rely heavily on the MAC for&#13;
the technical aspects of the mine-clearing program; i.e., for mine information, for coordinating&#13;
mine-clearance, mine awareness, and training programs, for setting standards, and for&#13;
supervising mine-clearing contracts on behalf of the Government, including carrying out Quality&#13;
Assurance.&#13;
39.   The initial three regional offices are expected to be operational by July. The mine&#13;
information data base within is expected to be installed and operational soon. The first contracts&#13;
for mine-clearing are expected to begin in August. Contracting and payments would remain a&#13;
central responsibility5; the regional offices, however, would be responsible for supervision as&#13;
soon as the offices are functional. The MAC, together with the MPRA, would also begin to&#13;
coordinate the survey activity that would be carried out in conjunction with the mine-clearing.&#13;
The mine information data base would be updated with the results of each survey and mine-&#13;
clearing operation. Mine clearing would be carried out according to standards set by the United&#13;
Nations.&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
40.   During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:&#13;
- Subsidiary financing agreements: Funds for carrying out the project within the two&#13;
entities would be made available by the state according to subsidiary financing&#13;
agreements&#13;
* between BH (the Borrower) and the Federation; and between BH and RS. Project&#13;
implementation agreements would also be entered into between BH and FBH and&#13;
between BH and RS.&#13;
* Implementation responsibilities: details are outlined in the Technical Annex&#13;
(Appendix I 1) and are included in the Minutes of Negotiations.&#13;
* Arrangements for institutional capacity: it was agreed that implementing agencies&#13;
would work closely with the UN-sponsored Mine Action Center, whose functions&#13;
include advising the Governnent on setting of standards, contracting and supervision&#13;
of contracts, including quality assurance (QA) of the work done.&#13;
* Mid-term Review: It was agreed that the Federation and the Republika Srpska&#13;
would each prepare a report on progress, outlining achievements to date and&#13;
remaining measures to ensure efficient implementation of the remainder of the&#13;
project, by about June 30, 1997.&#13;
5 Except for very small contracts (under $10,000) which would be handled by the regional offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
*  Safety standards and destruction of mines. It was agreed that all mine clearance&#13;
activities would be carried out, and all mines cleared under the project would be&#13;
promptly destroyed, in accordance with safety standards and guidelines of the United&#13;
Nations.&#13;
*  Laying down of new mines. The Credit Agreement specifies that if, in the sole&#13;
opinion of the Association, the development activity for which the mine-clearing has&#13;
been carried out is jeopardized by the laying of new landmines, the right of the&#13;
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account may be suspended.&#13;
*  Conditions of Effectiveness and Disbursement: The signing of the subsidiary&#13;
financing agreement between BH and FBH is a condition of effectiveness for the&#13;
Credit. The arrangements for project implementation in RS are likely to take&#13;
additional time, however. In order not to unduly delay project effectiveness,&#13;
therefore, signing of the subsidiary financing agreement between BH and RS before&#13;
December 31, 1996 has been made a condition of disbursement for the RS component&#13;
(part B) of the project.&#13;
41.   High priority mine-clearing already under preparation: Preparatory work has been&#13;
done on contracts (financed under the Bank's transport and energy projects) to remove landmines&#13;
in several high priority infrastructure sites -- i.e., in roads and railways, power transmission and&#13;
gas. The known or suspected presence of mines in these sites is, in many cases, restricting access&#13;
to engineers to carry out design work for reconstruction. These contracts correspond to the needs&#13;
in the first few months of the overall reconstruction program (Appendix 6 for the Government's&#13;
preliminary program6). Although these contracts are financed under other projects, the work is&#13;
being coordinated through the MPRA/MAC, as it needs to be done in a systematic institutional&#13;
manner.&#13;
42.   The technical specifications for the remaining mine-clearing work would be based on&#13;
those already worked out for the first contract (Appendix 10). The remaining work would be&#13;
carried out according to the priorities determined by the Bosnians, through the MCPG; i.e.:&#13;
* electricity transmission and distribution;&#13;
. roads;&#13;
. railroads;&#13;
. gas.&#13;
The second priority will be given to:&#13;
* housing&#13;
* water supply&#13;
social facilities (schools, health institutions, cultural institutions)&#13;
* communal activities&#13;
agriculture&#13;
* forestry.&#13;
6 Priorities for mine-clearing are currently being worked out in greater detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
However, much of the urgency in terms of the 'second priority' list will depend on the needs&#13;
related to reintegration of displaced people and refugees; and on funding. For example, some&#13;
donors are likely to specify housing as a first priority for their funds. Any proposal for mine-&#13;
clearing using IDA administered funds will only be considered if it is in accord with proposed&#13;
Bank guidelines concerning financing landmine clearance -- i.e., landmines need to be cleared to&#13;
make available land or infrastructure required for a development activity agreed with the&#13;
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
Procurement, Accounts, and Reporting&#13;
A. Procurement&#13;
43.   Because of the urgent nature of the project, the works, services and goods to be procured&#13;
with IDA funding would follow the expedited procedures developed for emergency projects in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina. With the exception of the Italian contribution to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
administered by the Bank, the participation of donors and other international institutions is likely&#13;
to be on a parallel basis, and will be according to their own procurement arrangements. The&#13;
procedures for procurement for the IDA financed items are as follows:&#13;
44.   For mine-clearing works procurement will be as follows:&#13;
*  National Competitive Bidding (NCB); procedures acceptable to IDA will be used&#13;
for contracts not to exceed US$ 1 million up to an aggregate amount of US$ 4.5&#13;
million.&#13;
*  Direct Contracting (DC); procedures will be used for minor mine clearing works in&#13;
support of reconstruction of certain key facilities up to an aggregate amount of US$&#13;
1.5 million. The use of DC would be reserved for works which are on the critical path&#13;
of urgent reconstruction or recovery projects.&#13;
45.  Substantial procurement of goods is not anticipated under the IDA credit. However,&#13;
where the procurement of equipment is deemed necessary by IDA for the implementation of the&#13;
landmine program, it will be procured as follows:&#13;
*  International Shopping (IS) will be used for procuring project equipment and&#13;
materials estimated to cost more than US$ 200,000 equivalent, but US$ 1,000,000&#13;
equivalent or less per contract.&#13;
*  National Shopping (NS) will be used for contracts for goods available in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina up to an estimated cost of US$ 200,000 per contract, with at least three&#13;
quotations.&#13;
46.   Consulting Services: consultancy services contracts, including training, totaling US$ 0.5&#13;
million, will be procured through short listing procedures. Any sole sourcing for consultant&#13;
services identified during project implementation will be subject to the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
47.   All contracts for works and goods procured through direct contracting, as well as the first&#13;
two contract's procured through NCB, IS, and NS, and all contracts over US$ 500,000, will be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review procedure. All consulting contracts in excess of US$ 100,000 for&#13;
firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals would also be subject to IDA's prior review. It is intended&#13;
that most of the prior review process would be carried out by the resident mission. All contracts&#13;
not subject to prior review would be subject to post review.&#13;
48.   Institutional arrangements for procurement: The MPRA, with support of the MAC,&#13;
will be responsible for the technical aspects of procurement. A contracting and implementation&#13;
adviser has been recruited, with financing under the Dutch Trust Fund for project preparation.&#13;
The adviser will assist the MPRA/MAC in the first few months, including training of Bosnian&#13;
staff in project implementation. A procurement seminar was held in June, 1996, and was&#13;
attended by the appropriate staff of the MPRA, MAC, and PIU.&#13;
B. Disbursement, Accounts, and Audit.&#13;
49.   The US$7.5 million equivalent would be disbursed against project components as&#13;
follows:&#13;

-16-&#13;
50.   Special Account.  To facilitate timely disbursement, special accounts would be&#13;
established in commercial banks acceptable to the World Bank. The authorized allocations of&#13;
the special accounts would be limited to US$ 0.525 million for Part A of the Project and US$&#13;
0.225 million for Part B of the Project, representing about four months of the Bank's share of&#13;
estimated expenditures. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three&#13;
months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate documents.&#13;
51.   Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Disbursements would be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditure for contracts for goods and works up to US$ 500,000 equivalent; (b) all&#13;
incremental operating costs and commercial services; (c) for consulting firms up to US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent; and (d) for individual consultants up to US$50,000 equivalent. All related SOE&#13;
documentation would be retained by the implementing agency, and made available for&#13;
subsequent examination by independent auditors and Bank supervision missions.  For all&#13;
contracts above these limits, full documentation would be required. The project completion date&#13;
would be June 30, 1998, and the closing date would be December 31, 1998.&#13;
52.   Accounts. Accounts of the expenditures made under the IDA credit, and with donor&#13;
resources deposited in the Bank's trust fund for use in this project, would be kept by the State&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The project accounts at the State MOF would consist of a record of&#13;
withdrawals on the IDA Credit. Responsibility for consolidation within each entity will begin&#13;
with project implementation. Such accounts shall be maintained in accordance with sound and&#13;
internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
53.   Audits. An auditor's opinion and report on these statements that is satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank will be provided within four months of the close of the fiscal year. The auditor's report&#13;
will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal&#13;
controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis for loan disbursements, special&#13;
account audit and compliance with financial covenants. The foregoing project accounting,&#13;
financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and timely information to&#13;
IDA for supervision of the project. These arrangements were agreed during negotiations.&#13;
C. Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
54.   Reporting. The MPRA will report on progress of the overall mine-clearing program&#13;
within a format, and with a frequency, to be determined by consultation involving the MCPG,&#13;
MAC, and implementing agencies in the entities. The reporting will cover progress on&#13;
institutional development, mine awareness, training, and mine-clearing. Progress reports would&#13;
be available to co-financiers. Arrangements for progress reports and project completion reports&#13;
were agreed with the borrower during negotiations.&#13;
55.   Supervision Plan. Bank supervision will be very frequent at first, as the Bank is an&#13;
integral part of the international community's assistance, both advisory and technical, to the&#13;
newly established structure for mine-clearing. In particular, the Bank's technical consultant will&#13;
travel relatively frequently, on short visits to Sarajevo (e.g., about every 2 months in the first six&#13;
months), and will be available for frequent consultation by telephone and fax. After the first six&#13;
months, a mission would evaluate project progress and review supervision needs accordingly.&#13;

Notes on Mine Clearance Techniques and Technology&#13;
I. Mine-clearing capacity&#13;
There are several sources from which mine clearers can be drawn. These each have&#13;
advantages and disadvantages:&#13;
*  Military teams: Local military teams have been conducting mine clearance since the&#13;
conflict, but their utility is often problematic because donors and reconstruction&#13;
program managers have little control over military clearance priorities and standards.&#13;
Donors and aid organizations in general are reluctant to fund military organizations.&#13;
Military teams are, in general, experienced in laying mines or in breaching minefields&#13;
(para. 3), but do not have experience in clearing mines to a high standard (to&#13;
humanitarian or civilian standards), and this has caused accidents. Nor do they have&#13;
any incentive to clear mines to a high standard without receiving additional pay.&#13;
Difficulties in monitoring military operations is also a consideration.&#13;
-  Police and civil defense: these have an important and continuing role in responding&#13;
to emergency calls for assistance, especially in situations involving an isolated mine&#13;
or unexploded bomb. Civil defense teams have usually operated on a volunteer basis&#13;
through the war, and typically need to return to their normal employment after the&#13;
war.&#13;
-  Commercial mine-clearing companies: commercial mine clearing organizations are&#13;
typically formed in response to the large-scale need for mine-clearing as a result of&#13;
protracted hostilities. Several such companies exist internationally, with experience&#13;
developed in Angola and/or Cambodia, for example, but they vary in experience and&#13;
competence.&#13;
*  Explosive ordnance disposal teams:  In Bosnia, some local commercial EOD&#13;
companies were still carrying out disposal activities from time to time on WWII&#13;
ordnance, but large-scale mine clearance requires a different organizational approach&#13;
from EOD, for which additional training is necessary.&#13;
.  Non-governmental organization (NGO) mine clearing teams:  NGO  mine&#13;
clearance teams have considerable experience, and may be willing to assist in mine-&#13;
clearing programs, and can often (but not always) offer lower prices, because of&#13;
voluntary or donor country contributions. They tend to be familiar with civilian&#13;
(humanitarian) clearance requirements, and can design their programs to train and use&#13;
local personnel; but they operate on a smaller scale than commercial companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
page 2 of 4&#13;
*  Local "developmental" mine-clearing capacity:  A local capacity, trained in&#13;
civilian mine clearing standards, is essential to address the wide-scale and long-term&#13;
needs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although this capacity may not initially be&#13;
sufficient to address the most immediate needs, it is important that international&#13;
assistance focuses on local management and training from the beginning, so that local&#13;
teams and companies can play an increasing role as the overall mine clearing program&#13;
is developed.&#13;
II. Mine Detection Methods&#13;
The choice of technology depends on the task, and no method is effective for clearing all&#13;
mines. In practice, several methods of mine clearing may be used, and several methods of&#13;
detection used in sequence to improve coverage.&#13;
* Manual probing: Due to the preponderance of non-metallic or minimum metallic&#13;
mines throughout the former Yugoslavia, the primary mine detection is 'mine&#13;
probing' supplemented by magnetic mine detection. This involves the insertion of a&#13;
lightweight mine probe or prodder into the ground, at an angle of 30°, to a depth of&#13;
100 mm, repeated every 3 cm across the area being searched. The operator uses the&#13;
probe to feel for hard objects buried under the surface. The insertion angle of 300 is&#13;
intended to minimize the risk of the operator inadvertently pressing on the top of the&#13;
mine. A trained mine clearer can expect to clear about 2m2 per hour using this&#13;
method.&#13;
* Mine sensing dogs: Dogs can be trained to react to the smell of explosives, thus&#13;
indicating the presence of mines. In mine clearance, the primary use of dogs is to&#13;
screen large areas very quickly, and allow mine clearers to focus operations on the&#13;
areas where the dogs indicate the presence of mines. The dogs require skilled&#13;
handlers who are able to interpret their signals and maximize their limited endurance.&#13;
Mechanical enhancements to dog-detecting operations are increasingly becoming&#13;
available (e.g., collecting samples of materials, with the location of the samples&#13;
recorded, and then using dogs to detect the presence of explosives). Vapor emission&#13;
detection systems have also been developed, but none yet have the sensitivities of a&#13;
trained dog.&#13;
*  Satellite or Aerial photography:  Detection of mined areas depends on the&#13;
identification of systematic or unusual disturbance of the earth. This method is only&#13;
effective for identifying relatively recent disturbances in open country. Ground&#13;
verification is required; and within the mined area, individual mines still need to be&#13;
located. No system has yet been demonstrated that will successfully detect mines in&#13;
the Bosnian environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
page 3 of 4&#13;
III. Mine Clearance Devices&#13;
Mechanical clearance devices, such as flails, are rarely able to guarantee a level of&#13;
clearance greater than 80%. Although they offer fast coverage, they require skilled&#13;
operators and are greatly affected by the type of terrain they encounter. They may be&#13;
used in support of manual clearance operations, but may not, on their own, provide&#13;
the&#13;
necessary level of clearance. For example, mechanical methods may be used as a&#13;
proving (testing or verification) method in areas where mines are suspected, as part of&#13;
the quality assurance process after manual clearance operations, as part of a route&#13;
clearance operation, or to clear vegetation before manual clearance.&#13;
*  Explosive clearance devices, such as fuel-air explosives or explosive hoses, have a&#13;
limited effective range and a large explosive area; they can damage infrastructure in&#13;
the mined area, and are difficult to deploy in areas covered by vegetation or rocks, or&#13;
in built-up areas. Their effectiveness is greatly reduced when deployed against blast-&#13;
resistant mines. They are therefore regarded as breaching devices (section IV). and&#13;
are not considered suitable for use in normal civilian operations. They are also&#13;
several orders of magnitude more expensive than manual clearance.&#13;
-  Mine protected vehicles are not clearance devices; but are a valuable asset to mine-&#13;
clearing operations, particularly to reconnaissance parties attempting to assess the&#13;
extent of mined or possibly mined areas.  They can also transport goods and&#13;
personnel over routes which may be mined, thus facilitating reconstruction even while&#13;
demining is taking place. As such, they are valuable life-saving equipment for those&#13;
operating in mine contaminated areas.&#13;
*  Other methods. Other devices may be appropriate where the potential user can&#13;
demonstrate that the equipment can achieve the necessary level of clearance.&#13;
Considerable research and development needs to be undertaken to identify and&#13;
develop faster means of detecting the presence of minimum metallic mines; at&#13;
present, no such technology is yet suitable for field use. Any proposal for the use of'&#13;
new technology needs to be accompanied by substantial proof that it is capable of&#13;
reaching the minimum clearance standard for civilian mine clearance operation&#13;
(section IV).&#13;
IV. Mine Clearance Standards&#13;
Military mine clearing. Many soldiers (particularly field or combat engineers) are&#13;
trained in minefield breaching operations, carried out to 'punch a hole' through a&#13;
minefield during combat. A minefield breach is normally carried out in support of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
page 4 of 4&#13;
immediate tactical objective, and may involve a situation where the local commander&#13;
judges that the risk of breaching the minefield, with whatever resources are available,&#13;
is necessary in view of the tactical aims -- given that minefields, like other military&#13;
obstacles, are often covered by defensive fire under such circumstances. A minefield&#13;
breaching operation may result in significant casualties among the conducting troops&#13;
or subsequent users. Mine breaching techniques are designed for speed, and often&#13;
merely push mines aside without destroying them. They are therefore rarely suitable&#13;
for civilian mine clearance operations.&#13;
Civilian (humanitarian) mine clearance standards. For civilian use of land, there&#13;
is no 'acceptable' level of residual landmine contamination. However, although&#13;
100% clearance is the objective of all civilian mine clearance efforts, a total guarantee&#13;
that all the mines have been removed will never be given by any reputable mine&#13;
clearer. The UN advocates that humanitarian mine clearance operations should aim to&#13;
achieve 100% clearance, with a minimum standard ' in excess of 99% clear'. At&#13;
present, the only method capable of providing this level of clearance is manual&#13;
clearance using mine probes supported (but not replaced by) mine detectors and&#13;
sniffing dogs. The other military or mechanical methods described above may be&#13;
used to complement manual mine clearance, particularly in survey or 'proving'&#13;
operations intended to establish whether mines are present. They should not be&#13;
regarded as primary means of mine clearance.&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT&#13;
Lessons from Mine Clearance Programs&#13;
1.    Large scale civilian mine clearance is comparatively new. Clearance after World War II&#13;
was done sporadically in several countries, often by soldiers. The end of the cold war allowed&#13;
the world to look at the mine contamination conditions in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and several&#13;
countries in Africa and Latin America, and to establish civilian programs to deal with them. The&#13;
first major program was set up by the United Nations in Afghanistan, where mine clearance&#13;
started in early 1990. The clean-up after the Gulf War in 1991 and 1992 brought major civilian&#13;
contractors into the mine clearance business, and many lessons were learnt during this period.&#13;
These have been confirmed or modified as a result of other programs in Mozambique, Somalia,&#13;
Rwanda, El Salvador and Angola. Although the mine problems and their solutions have been&#13;
unique to each country, the fundamental principles remain the same.&#13;
2.    Mine Clearance by Soldiers. It is tempting to assume that, because soldiers lay mines&#13;
easily, they should be able to remove them with equal facility. The lessons of the past indicate&#13;
that unfortunately this is not the case. Removing mines requires a different order of discipline,&#13;
training and equipment to carry out large-scale humanitarian mine clearance, which is (or should&#13;
be) more like an industrial process than its military counterpart, minefield breaching (Appendix&#13;
8). Soldiers tend to hurry the mine-clearance process, which usually results in casualties.&#13;
Soldiers can be trained in civilian mine clearance methods, and regiments of Bangladeshi,&#13;
Egyptian, and Pakistani soldiers were trained in Kuwait. It has been found that ex-soldiers, who&#13;
have chosen to make their living clearing mines are often more mature, and make better mine&#13;
clearers.&#13;
3.    Mechanical Mine Clearance.  Every mine clearance program has searched for a&#13;
mechanical solution to the mine clearance problem; the circumstances in Kuwait should have&#13;
been ideal for such a solution. In fact, the lessons of Kuwait, and other programs, have shown&#13;
that hand clearance is still the only truly thorough method of mine clearance. There is no&#13;
shortage of ideas for new techniques and technologies, but most of these fail to take fully into&#13;
account the destructive energy of an anti-tank mine. They also tend to assume that mines always&#13;
work according to their design parameters.  Mines, however, become unreliable and&#13;
unpredictable, which increase their danger, and the difficulty of finding a safe and reliable&#13;
method of clearing them.&#13;
4.    Management and Administration. The lessons that have been repeated in almost all&#13;
programs is that a capability in mine clearance alone is insufficient. The mine clearance&#13;
capability has to be backed by capable and experienced managed and sound administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Many small mine companies ceased operations in Kuwait because or poor management and the&#13;
resulting accidents. It is difficult to eradicate all accidents, because, ultimately, during the&#13;
clearance process, a mine-clearer has to deal directly with the mine, and many accidents are due&#13;
to the human failings of inattention, lapses of discipline, or lapses of memory.&#13;
5.    Support Systems. Another lesson of experience is the folly of rushing into a clearance&#13;
program, without proper attention to the medical, communications, casualty evacuation and&#13;
support systems that have to be in place before the first mine clearer steps into a minefield.&#13;
These preparations take time, but cannot be ignored or set aside in the interest of more rapid&#13;
action.&#13;
6.    Enhancing Local Capacity. It is also essential to think in detail about how local&#13;
capacity is to be created and supported. It has been found that setting up an organization to train&#13;
mine clearers is only part of the problem. More important is establishing the management&#13;
organization that will deploy them after training. In three major programs, more students were&#13;
trained than could be employed; many drifted into other jobs, so their skills were lost. Others&#13;
needed expensive re-training before they could be employed in mine-clearing. Setting up a mine&#13;
clearance capacity therefore requires detailed planning and careful coordination of training and&#13;
employment opportunities. This, in turn, means identifying and scheduling mine-clearing&#13;
priorities and, at the same time, securing adequate funding (including fitting cash flows to the&#13;
priority schedule) from donors, loans, and other sources.&#13;
7.    Risks and Public Perception. The lessons of the past six years have shown that until&#13;
successful new technologies for mine detection and clearance can be developed (which will&#13;
require substantial funding), mine clearing will continue to be a slow, dangerous, and expensive&#13;
business. Any mine clearing program faces the probability that there will be fatal or serious&#13;
accidents, which will spark criticism from those who are divorced from the problem. However,&#13;
there is less likely to be criticism from those whose lives are endangered by the mines, or whose&#13;
access to utilities, services, shelter, or employment is curtailed by mine contamination.&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference for a Pilot Project&#13;
I. General Information and Requirements&#13;
1.1   The pilot project contractor (PPC) is required to provide qualified staff and equipment for&#13;
training up to 40 Bosnian mine clearance students in techniques of civilian (humanitarian) mine&#13;
clearance in support of a pilot mine clearance project, in town  . The project will set up two&#13;
independent Bosnian 20-person mine and munitions clearance teams in the area, with a view to&#13;
forming a mine-clearing company.&#13;
1.2   The PPC's training team will set up a small operations headquarters in the town, assisted by&#13;
the local authorities. It will assist in the selection and screening of 40 candidates for mine clearance&#13;
duties, including potential team leaders and administrators. It will assist the local authorities in the&#13;
selection of two medical specialists. When the recruitment has been completed, the PPC will set up&#13;
a small instructional facility, and train the first 20-person team, which will be deployed into the&#13;
field. The second 20-person team will then be trained and deployed.&#13;
1.3   The trainers will also give instruction in the management of small local mine clearance&#13;
programs. When the initial training is complete, the instructors will deploy into local minefields&#13;
with the students, continuing the instruction and supervision under operational field conditions.&#13;
Training will initially continue for three months, with an option for a further two months.&#13;
1.4   The PPC will provide advice and practical assistance, as necessary, on all aspects of setting&#13;
up a new enterprise (credit, taxes, registration, etc.).&#13;
1.5   The students will be selected by the Government acting in cooperation with the Mine Action&#13;
Center (MAC) and the local authorities. It would be an advantage if the selected students were&#13;
demobilized soldiers with some previous experience of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) or&#13;
demining training. They should be local, and available for operations in the general area. They&#13;
would be self-administered.&#13;
Training&#13;
1.6   The following subjects would be taught:&#13;
* The use of conventional mine clearance equipment, i.e., prodders and electronic mine&#13;
detectors&#13;
* The methodology of civilian mine clearance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
* Survey and marking of minefields&#13;
*  Safety procedures&#13;
*  Render Safe procedures for the range of mines and munitions found in Bosnia&#13;
*  Demolition procedures&#13;
*  First aid procedures, and assistance to paramedics in case of accident.&#13;
*  Refresher training on communications.&#13;
Selected students will also be instructed in the management of mine clearance programs, including&#13;
operations, administration and logistic support.&#13;
1.8   The PPC will provide five (5) training personnel. Four of these, a Project Leader, survey&#13;
specialist, safety specialist, and business adviser, will be required for an initial period of six months.&#13;
The fifth instructor will be deployed for the six weeks of instruction only, i.e., until both teams are&#13;
fielded. All team members involved in mine-clearance training will be required to give instruction&#13;
in the classroom and in live minefields.&#13;
1.9   The syllabus for training will initially be provided by the United Nations through the MAC.&#13;
This will be modified in the light of experience. The training course will last three weeks, although&#13;
this may be shortened or lengthened if necessary. Further periods of refresher training may be given&#13;
if appropriate.&#13;
1.10 Tasking and supervision. The main tasking authority is the Government, who will act&#13;
through its authorized MAC in the areas of-&#13;
*  Endorsing the pilot mine clearance contract&#13;
*  Acting as the initial contact point between the PPC and the local municipal and military&#13;
authorities&#13;
*  Providing any relevant mine date from the Central Mine Data Bank, including details of&#13;
known minefields in the local area and the types and characteristics of mines likely to be&#13;
found.&#13;
*  Monitoring the implementation of the contract.&#13;
*  Carrying out Quality Assurance, to provide certification of satisfactory completion o&#13;
works in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
1.11   Local Authorities. The local municipal and military authorities will be asked to cooperate&#13;
with the project, initially by providing:&#13;
*  A site for indoor instruction&#13;
*  Nominations for 40 students&#13;
*  Two medical orderlies&#13;
*  Two interpreters&#13;
*  A site for a clearance project headquarters&#13;
*  A site for storage of demolition supplies&#13;
*  In coordination with Government, a site for the demolition of unexploded mines and&#13;
munitions&#13;
*  Accommodation for the five instructional staff&#13;
*  Nominations for two team leaders&#13;
*  A project coordinator and administrator/secretary&#13;
Local headquarters will also prepare a list of priority areas for clearance, under the authority of the&#13;
Government, and with the assistance of the MAC.&#13;
1.12  It will probably be necessary to provide the salaries for all local demining and other staff, at&#13;
least for the training period.&#13;
1.13   The term of the contract will be two hundred (200) days, but may be renewed as mutually&#13;
agreed.&#13;
1.14  Equipment. The PPC will supply the following equipment:&#13;
*  Three 4x4 six seater cars, fitted for radio&#13;
*  Four 11 -seater vans, two fitted for radio&#13;
*  Two six-seater cars, locally converted to carry stretchers&#13;
*  electronic mine detectors&#13;
*  sets of protective clothing&#13;
*  global positioning system (GPS): navigational equipment&#13;
*  sets of hand tools in light satchels&#13;
*  twenty-person tents&#13;
*  x 1.5 kw generator&#13;
*  km of minefield marking supplies&#13;
*  two lap top computers&#13;
*  maps of the local region&#13;
*  blackboards, stationery, and other instructional material&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
1.15  Safety. All mines and munitions will be destroyed on the day they are found. Destruction&#13;
will be by detonation, deflagration or burning as appropriate. The PPC team is responsible for&#13;
ensuring that no workable mines or munitions are removed from the clearance sites.&#13;
1.16 Coordination. All mine clearance will be coordinated with the MAC, which will be the&#13;
center of excellence from whom advice on all mine clearance matters will be sought. The MAC&#13;
will provide information on any known minefields in the local area, and will be informed of the&#13;
progress of any clearance carried out by the local teams.&#13;
1.17  Medical. The project leader, in conjunction with the Government and the local authorities,&#13;
will recruit two trained medical specialists, one of which will accompany each 20-person team in a&#13;
locally converted ambulance. They will make and maintain contact with the local hospital.&#13;
1.18  Communications. The Government, in conjunction with the local authorities, will allocate&#13;
a radio frequency for the mine clearance project. Communication will be maintained between the&#13;
clearance teams and the project office, and between the medical teams, clearance teams and the&#13;
local hospital. If possible, communications will be by hand-held VHF radios, working n the&#13;
simplex or duplex mode. Communication with the MAC will be by telephone, or if necessary a&#13;
radio link will be established.&#13;
1.19  Reporting.  The PPC team will report to the local authorities weekly, and to the&#13;
Government as required by MAC. Any accidents or incidents will be reported to the MAC&#13;
immediately. The PPC team will keep a record of all mines and munitions cleared, stating location,&#13;
numbers and type. The Team will maintain a mine and munitions clearance record in the format&#13;
requested by the MAC, and will present the record to the MAC when and where requested. At the&#13;
end of the contract period, the PPC will complete a full report of the progress of the contract, in a&#13;
format to be agreed by the MAC.&#13;
1.20  Timing. The contractor will be expected to have recruited and deployed the four team&#13;
members within 20 days of contract signing. Training should start within one week of deployment.&#13;
The first 20-person team will be ready for deployment into mined areas three weeks after the start of&#13;
training, and the second team should be able to deploy within three weeks of the first. After three&#13;
months, training of the local team leaders will commence, with the aim of dispensing with all&#13;
consultants by the end of six months.&#13;
1.21  Costs. An outline budget giving estimated contract costs (in $ thousands) for the first six&#13;
months is as follows:&#13;
Personnel, including consultants, local mine clearers, and administrators  $229&#13;
Equipment, including vehicles, mine clearing, and training equipment  $384&#13;
Running costs                                                       $115&#13;
Total (6 months)                                             $728&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT&#13;
Draft Summary Terms of Reference for Quality Assurance Assessment&#13;
I. General Information and Requirements&#13;
1.1  It is anticipated that contracts let by the Bosnian Government through the Mine Action&#13;
Center (MAC) will be let competitively, and contain a requirement for the work under contract to&#13;
be subject to Quality Assurance (QA) conditions. QA is central to the contractual process, to&#13;
ensure that mine clearance is carried out in a thorough, safe, and cost-effective manner. QA&#13;
assessment will initially be carried out by a QA team consisting of a contractor, supported by a&#13;
group of Bosnian specialists.&#13;
1.2   Requirement. The general requirement for the contractor is to establish a QA assurance&#13;
section in the MAC, to carry out QA on all mine clearance contracts let by MAC. The contractor&#13;
will recruit and assemble a team of qualified staff, sufficient to provide a small headquarters&#13;
section and the resources to provide at lest two QA teams. The headquarters element will&#13;
provide support within the MAC, and the teams will be deployed to scrutinize the operations of&#13;
the contractors, in up to two separate locations.&#13;
1.3   Specifications and standards: The QA procedures will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
Section II. The Contractor will, through the senior members of the assessment team, advise the&#13;
MAC on the measures being taken to ensure the maintenance of high standards of mine and&#13;
munitions clearance, and to suggest modifications and improvements to the QA assessment&#13;
procedures.&#13;
1.4   Tasking and supervision: The main tasking authority is the Government, acting through&#13;
the MAC or one of its Regional Offices in the Federation and the Republika Srpska. The&#13;
Government shall be responsible for:&#13;
* Determining the priority for the QA assessment on contracted mine clearance work,&#13;
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract&#13;
* Authorizing the contractor to carry out QA assessment, including allowing the import&#13;
of the contractor's equipment, vehicles and supplies required for the assessment.&#13;
. Authorizing the QA assessment contractor to demand from the mine clearance&#13;
contractors any document or facilities necessary to the QA assessment process.&#13;
* Establishing any necessary contact between the contractor and the Roads Directorate,&#13;
Railways Organization, Elektroprivreda, Sarajevo Gas, and the District Heating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 8&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
authority to confirm that the specifications of the cleared areas complies with the&#13;
requirements of those Agencies.&#13;
*  Providing mine data from the central mine data bank, including details of known&#13;
minefields in the contractor's areas of operations and the types and characteristics of&#13;
mines likely to be found.&#13;
*  In conjunction with all parties, ensuring full and free access to the areas under their&#13;
control for the purpose of conducting QA monitoring and assessment.&#13;
*  Monitoring of the implementation of the QA contract, to ensure that the provisions of&#13;
the contract adhered to; and&#13;
.  Liaison with other agencies and/or organizations conducting, or involved with,&#13;
demining activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
1.5   Use of Local Labor. A pool of skilled labor exists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including&#13;
certified EOD specialists. The QA contractor will, with the assistance of the Government, recruit&#13;
a number of local staff to enable the assessment to be one by mixed expatriate/local teams.&#13;
1.6   Training Facilities.  Training of local QA assessment staff will be carried out by&#13;
contractors both in the MAC and on or near the worksite.&#13;
1.7   Equipment and Supplies. The contractor shall bring sufficient equipment, supplies and&#13;
spare parts for six (6) months of operation, with the exception of fuels and lubricants. Fuels and&#13;
lubricants and maintenance and repair of vehicles shall be the responsibility of the contractor.&#13;
1.8   Accommodation. The contractor shall be required to find suitable accommodation for its&#13;
expatriate staff, and to provide its own logistic support. When working on a detached site,&#13;
accommodation for all employees, both local and expatriate, shall be provided by the QA&#13;
contractor, in conjunction with the MAC and the mine clearance contractor.&#13;
1.9   Transport. The QA contractor shall provide sufficient vehicles to ensure that each&#13;
assessment teamn shall be self sufficient in land transport.&#13;
1.10  Reporting and Marking. The QA contractor will keep a record of all visits to the&#13;
clearance contractor, and of any advice or warnings given to that contractor. He will record the&#13;
numbers and areas of sites sampled in the QA assessment process, and of any finds in the&#13;
sampled areas. He will report on the QA carried out on a weekly basis. A three-month report is&#13;
also required, as well as a report at the end of the contract period. He will submit these reports in&#13;
the format requested by the MAC. If the QA contractor finds any mines in the sampled areas, he&#13;
will mark the areas of a potential mine hazard in accordance with current MAC marking&#13;
procedures. Any mines or munitions found during the QA sampling must be completely&#13;
destroyed by the mine&#13;

appropriate.&#13;
1.11  Medical Support. The QA contractor will ensure that adequate medical cover and backup&#13;
casualty evacuation is available for his QA staff. When operating in close proximity to clearance&#13;
contractors, the QA staff will benefit from the medical and casualty evacuation cover provided&#13;
by those contractors. When operating independently, the QA contractor my provide his own&#13;
medical support.&#13;
1.12  Communication. The QA contractor is responsible for ensuring that there is a reliable&#13;
means of communication between the QA assessment teams and the MAC, the clearance&#13;
contractors, the mine clearance contractor's paramedics and doctor, the hospitals and the&#13;
CASEVAC system. This communication will use radio frequencies in cooperation with the&#13;
Government communication authority. The QA contractor will ensure that sampling operations&#13;
are dependent on the maintenance of communications with the medical staff, and will cease if&#13;
such communications are unworkable.&#13;
1.13  Training. The QA contractor is responsible for training the local Bosnian QA team&#13;
members up to the standard when they can take full responsibility on behalf of the Government&#13;
for the QA process. This training must be completed by the end of the contract period.&#13;
1.14  Administration, Logistics and Equipment.  The QA contractor is responsible for&#13;
providing all the elements of administration and logistics required for the completion of the&#13;
contract, and for the provision of all operational equipment, including the detectors, prodders and&#13;
protective gear required for his teams, both expatriate and Bosnian components. The QA&#13;
contractor is responsible for the provision of food, water, fuel, vehicles, spare parts, and repair&#13;
and maintenance capability. Any vehicles and equipment purchased as part of the contract will&#13;
be transferred to the MAC for use by the Bosnian QA teams, at the end of the contract.&#13;
1.15  Insurance and Compensation. The QA contractor is responsible for establishing his own&#13;
insurance cover, both for accidents to QA assessment staff and for damage to third parties or&#13;
third party property. The Government will not accept liability for any injury, loss or damage&#13;
arising from accidents during the QA assessment process, or from any contract concerning mine&#13;
and munitions clearance.&#13;
II. QA specifications&#13;
2.1   The QA assessment will take place in three phases:&#13;
* The QA contractor will examine the qualifications, standing orders, and safety&#13;
regulations of the mine clearance contractors before they start work, to ensure as far&#13;
as possible that the mine clearance contractor can establish a safe and effective&#13;
clearance regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 8&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
*  The QA contractor will make numerous planned and random visits to the clearance&#13;
contractor's work site, to ensure that the approved clearance procedures are being&#13;
fully and safely complied with.&#13;
*  The QA contractor will carry out random sampling of the cleared areas, to check that&#13;
no mines or munitions have been left uncleared by the contractor. If necessary, the&#13;
MAC will check up to 100% of the cleared areas; under normal circumstances, the&#13;
proportion actually sampled will be lower.&#13;
2.2   Quality Assurance Standards.  Before the mine and munitions clearance task&#13;
commences, the MAC will define the clearance standards to be achieved, which will allow the&#13;
MAC to measure the compliance of the mine clearance organization with their contractual&#13;
obligation. These clearance standards will be agreed by the clearance contractor before the&#13;
contract is let. The QA standard to be achieved will normally be set at 99.6%; this figure is the&#13;
expected achievement level on all sites, irrespective of the depths to which the clearance&#13;
contractor is able to clear. The clearance contractor will be expected to achieve 100% clearance&#13;
at the depth specified in the contract prior to work commencing. This will be a practical depth,&#13;
taking into account the type of clearance to be used and the specific clearance needs of any&#13;
particular site. The 99.6% figure means that although the contractor must clear all mines to the&#13;
practical clearance depth stated in the contract, he has no liability after the QA and handover&#13;
process for:&#13;
(a)   mines and munitions buried deeper than the search requirements stated for the&#13;
site;&#13;
(b)   mines or munitions migrating into the contract area, as a result of flooding or soil&#13;
movement; or&#13;
(c)   subsequent dumping of mines or munitions, or re-mining by third parties.&#13;
2.3    Handover. The QA contractor will assist the MAC in the establishment of a formal&#13;
handover process, and in defining the point at which any area cleared by the mine clearance&#13;
contractor is ready for general use and the clearance contractor's invoices may be submitted for&#13;
payment. The handover process is as follows:&#13;
* The clearance contractor will issue to the MAC a handover certificate which declares&#13;
that to the best of his knowledge and belief, the declared area is free of mines and&#13;
munitions, to the standards required by the MAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 8&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
The QA contractor's assessment team will assess the cleared area after the issue of the&#13;
handover certificate, by sampling a [pre-determined] area of the cleared zone to&#13;
ensure that the clearance is free of munitions and mines to the standards established&#13;
by the MAC. The assessment team will forward the handover certificate to the MAC&#13;
with an endorsement which states that a sample was examined by the team, and no&#13;
munitions or mines were found.&#13;
* If any munitions or mines are found during the QA assessment, the site will be re-&#13;
cleared to achieve the 100% requirement at the expense of the contractor.&#13;
2.4   The Government will state in the clearance contract how much time is available for the&#13;
QA Contractor to carry out QA; this will vary according to the nature of the clearance contract,&#13;
but will probably not exceed three weeks. After the QA period has expired, the cleared area will&#13;
be accepted as free of munitions and mines by default, and any clearance failures discovered by&#13;
QA assessment after the time deadline will be cleared at the Government's expense. Once the&#13;
handover process is completed, the Goveirnent accepts the ground as ready for subsequent use&#13;
on the understanding that the whole QA process has sought to minimize the residual hazard, but&#13;
cannot guarantee that all the ground is 100% clear of mines and munitions.&#13;
2.5   After the QA process is complete, and the site has been "handed over" to the&#13;
reconstruction contractor, it becomes the responsibility of that contractor. This includes ensuring&#13;
the safety of his own staff and maintaining the marking of the cleared area during his occupancy&#13;
of the site.&#13;
2.6  In the event of a mine or munitions accident during the process of QA assessment, the&#13;
accident will be the subject of an independent Board of Inquiry set up by the Government. The&#13;
QA contractor will be responsible for cooperating fully with the Board, and will be required to&#13;
abide by its findings and recommendations.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Emergency
            Landmines Clearance Project are to protect vulnerable groups
            until mines in their communities can be cleared, and to
            clear mines in support of priority reconstruction, economic
            recovery and the restoration of essential public services.
            The components of this project are a) setting up the
            institutional structure; b) protecting vulnerable population
            groups; c) increasing local mine-clearing capacity; and d)
            carrying out urgent mine clearing.
