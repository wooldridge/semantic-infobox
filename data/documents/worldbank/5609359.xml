 1.      Background&#13;
&#13;
         Almost three decades o f conflict in Angola have left the country's infrastructure in a&#13;
serious state o f disrepair. The majority o f roads are impassable or unsafe; in addition, some 5-7&#13;
million landmines are still in place and pose a threat to the lives and well-being o f the people.&#13;
The provinces most severely affected include Bie, Huambo, Moxico, Lunda Norte and Lunda&#13;
SUI, Uige, Cuando Cubango and Malanje. Aggravated by adverse climatic situations, conditions&#13;
are worst inthe rural areas, while lack o f seed coupled with the limited availability o f fertilizers&#13;
and other agricultural inputs mean that many people have to struggle with severe shortages, go&#13;
hungryand, as a result, suffer from malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Context&#13;

    Terms of Reference for the Design of Basic Projects to recover about 748 kilometers of Feeder&#13;
                                   Roads inthe provinces of Malange and BiC.&#13;
&#13;
 1.      Background.&#13;
&#13;
After nearly thirty years o fconflict, Angola's infrastructure i s today badly wrecked. Most o f the&#13;
highways are impassable or unsafe; besides, about 5-7 million explosive mines were laid inthe ground&#13;
and threaten peoples' lives and populationwelfare. Bik, Huambo, Moxico, LundaNorte, Lunda Sul,&#13;
Uige, Cuando, Cubango and Malanje are the most affected provinces.&#13;
&#13;
Inrural areas, life quality is the worst conceivable. A recent droughtrenderedthe situationevenworse.&#13;
The rural population can't get to have any productive activity for lack o f seeds, fertilizers and highways to&#13;
send out the production. These needs, combined with other agricultural difficulties, are the causes o f the&#13;
rural exodus and suffering for a lot o fpeople due to a severe shortage, famine and malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
Angola Government intends to start an infrastructure recovering programcapable to enable the supply o f&#13;
basic social services to the peasants, especially by improving the transport infrastructure, which will help&#13;
the free movement o f people and goods, combined with measures to foster the rural economy through&#13;
direct investments inagriculture and small rural industries.&#13;
&#13;
T o implement this process, EMRP includes a component for the development o f agriculture according to&#13;
which the first thing is to restructure and strengthen the national seed production and control systems and&#13;
also to recover the feeder roads network intwo provinces: Malange and BiC.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Context&#13;
&#13;
Within the scope o f the country infrastructure, feeder roads represented the most affected segment during&#13;
the 25-year war. They didn't receive any maintenance, many were mined and bridges were destroyed in&#13;
others&#13;
&#13;
Because no regular maintenance was possible duringthe years o fwar, rural roads are severely damaged.&#13;
Inmanylocations, evenduringtheperiodofdryweather, trafficinsuchhighwaysisverydifficult, affects&#13;
significantly any negatively any plannedagriculturalproductionprogram, simply because o f the lack o f&#13;
safety for production outlet.&#13;
The Provincial Governments are today responsible for the conservation o f feeder roads; however, due to&#13;
the shortage o fresources, the governments can do very little inthe short runto implement effective&#13;
rehabilitationand maintenance programs.&#13;
The example o f punctual rehabilitation interventions carriedout by foreign aid agencies, United Nations&#13;
agencies and NGOsattest the success o f EMRP proposal o f investinginthe recovery o f feeder roads.&#13;
Such actions show that the re-establishment o f vehicle circulation allowed a significant improvement in&#13;
the quality o f life for the rural populationliving near the recoveredroutes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.       Objective of Consultancy Contract&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this consultancy i s the contracting o f specialized company to design the projects necessary&#13;

&#13;
6.3      Route Studies&#13;
&#13;
Because the stretches where road rehabilitationis due to follow the existingroad route do not include&#13;
Route Studies, such studies will only be carried out inthe cases o f alternate routes or inthe studies o f&#13;
different alternatives, and afterjudicious problem analysis and if so authorizedby the Inspection.&#13;
When necessary, Route Study must include the implementation o f the following activities:&#13;
0        Collect, analysis and study o f existing data, such as maps, contour maps and previous projects,&#13;
         targeting the indication o f new opportunities to improve the route;&#13;
b        Study o f new opportunities to improve the existing route, including field inspection for&#13;
         characterization o f crossing points and critical segments, whenever any deficiencies are detected&#13;
         inthe route;&#13;
0        Route Study mustbe submitted as follows:&#13;
b        Descriptive text providing ajustification o fthe studies carriedout;&#13;
0        Recommendations regarding the performance o f topographical studies inthe strip to be surveyed;&#13;

&#13;
6.4      Topographical Studies&#13;
&#13;
6.4.1    Inthose segmentswhere the currentroadroutewillbekept, requiringonly smallinterventions, as&#13;
described in item 5.3.1, the preliminary surveys described in the first phase will be applied, including a&#13;
simple description of the activities that must be implemented along the road stretches, and the GPS-&#13;
determined coordinates and true heights o f interventions.&#13;
&#13;
6.4.2 . Inthose critical points and stretches where route alteration i s requested, the topographical studies&#13;
will include, basically, the implementationo f a polygonal with anchorage inthe vertexes, geometric&#13;
leveling and counter leveling, implementation o f benchmarks, survey of study strip and corresponding&#13;
drawings, complying by the following recommendations:&#13;
&#13;
         Implementation o f one basic polygonal along the strike defined by the route studies, by usingthe&#13;
         total station type electronic equipment. This polygonal must be closed and be 5.0 (five) kilometer&#13;
         long at most. Closure mistake tolerances will be:&#13;
         Linear closure: 20 mm, Angular closure: OO"OO'30" and Altimetrical closure: 20 mm&#13;
         In order to control both the polygonal location and the leveling base, also in this case GPS-&#13;
         determined coordinates and true heights must be established at every 5.0 (five) kilometers, or at&#13;
         least 2 (two) observations, one in the beginning and the other in the end o f the polygonal,&#13;
         including the implantation o f (two) concrete landmarks in each determination site, provided with&#13;
         metallic pins.&#13;
         The survey o f study strip will be carried out by the total station by applying the point chainage&#13;
         process, with minimumdensity o f 300 points per kilometer. Survey strip minimumwidth mustbe&#13;
         15 (fifteen) meters to each side o fthe polygonal.&#13;
         The survey must generate ground plan drawings in the 01:02 AM.000 scale, including entire strip&#13;
         planimetry and altimetry. Contour lines must be represented in the drawing with a I-meter&#13;
         contour interval.&#13;

                                               Appendix 3: Health&#13;
&#13;
Healthsector assessment&#13;
&#13;
Angola has a very young population, with about 50 percent under the age 15 and 93 percent under the age&#13;
of 50. Its total fertility remains high(7 in2001). The prolongedarmed conflict has promptedmassive&#13;
movements o fpopulation and produced about 4 million internallydisplaced people, most o f whom have&#13;
found refuge inthe costal provinces. The living conditions o f the refugees and internally displaced&#13;
people are very poor.&#13;
&#13;
Healthstatus&#13;
&#13;
The healthsituation inAngola is one o fthe worst inthe world. Atjust 40.2 years, Angola also has one o f&#13;
the lowest life expectancies inthe world. Malnutrition i s acute; about 45 percent o f children under age 5&#13;
suffer from stunting (low height-for-age) and 31percent are underweight. This puts Angola inthe very&#13;
highlevelo fstuntingandwillhave enormous social andeconomic implicationsinthe foreseeable future.&#13;
With 6 percentprevalence, the severity o fwasting among Angolan childrenis mediumaccording to&#13;
WHO threshold levels. Nevertheless there is growing evidence that from 2002 untilthe end o f 2003 the&#13;
health status has improved all over the country and sever malnutrition i s occurringinonly some areas.&#13;
&#13;
The under-five mortality rate, estimated at 250 per 1,000 live births inthe 2001 multiple indicator survey&#13;
and the infant mortality rate at 150per 1,000 live births (compared with 91 for Sub-Saharan Africa as a&#13;
whole) are among the worst inthe world. Ininfants, the main causes of death are related to malaria,&#13;
diarrhea, respiratory infections, anemia and measles, and, incertain areas, malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
The country has notpassedthrough the demographic transition like some o fthe southem African&#13;
countries. It still has a highfertility rate o f 7. Sexual activity begins at a young age, and due to a very&#13;
low contraceptive prevalence rate (less than 2.8 percent o f couples use a modem contraceptive method),&#13;
some 27 percent o f women aged 15-19 years old are already mothers.&#13;
&#13;
This situation has implications interms o freproductive healthand maternal mortality. The maternal&#13;
mortality rate stands at 1,500 matemal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1994 compared to 600 in 1992,&#13;
according to institutional data. The main causes o f death for women are malaria, hemorrhage, eclampsia,&#13;
and complications o f abortion and prolongedlabor. These causes are commonly associated to poverty&#13;
and to the lack o f access to adequate reproductive health services that are neither expensive nor&#13;
technically demanding. For example inMalange increasedaccess and limited trainingprovided inthe&#13;
provincial capital helped to reduce the matemal mortality rate from 3,007 per 100,000 in 2000 to 1,085&#13;
per 100,000 in2003 (Malange Directorate o f Public Health2003 draft annual report).&#13;
&#13;
Epidemiologicalsituation&#13;
&#13;
Angola's epidemiological profile i s characterized by still having a high burden o f disease related to&#13;
nutritional deficiencies and infectious and parasitic diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and&#13;
HIV/AIDS.&#13;
&#13;
The epidemiological surveillance systemis poor, although a network o f sentinel sites, basedon a system&#13;
of radio transmissions, has recently been established with support o f WHO and UNICEFcovering almost&#13;
all the provinces. The most common causes for visits to healthcare facilities in2001 were malaria, acute&#13;
respiratory infections, diarrhea, and typhoid fever. Of transmissible diseases, tuberculosis was the sixth&#13;
cause for visits to health care facilities and measles was the tenth. Malaria and diarrhea were the most&#13;
important causes o f death followed by tuberculosis andrespiratory infections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Malaria alone accounts for more than 60 percent of all outpatient visits and death by transmissible&#13;
diseases reported in2001. According to the National Malaria Control Program, every Angolan typically&#13;
experiences 3 to 5 malaria episodes per year. The multiple indicator cluster survey 2 usingthe prevalence&#13;
o f fever as a proxy for malaria showed that 25 percent o f the childrenhad fever inthe previous 2 weeks.&#13;
Only 10percent o f householdsusebed netsto prevent transmissiono fmalaria.&#13;
&#13;
Diarrhea prevalence among the under-five year olds stands at 25 percent (multiple indicator cluster survey&#13;
2) but only 7 percent of these cases were treated with more fluids and continued feeding. Only 40 percent&#13;
o f such cases were treated with oral rehydrationsalts.&#13;
&#13;
Measles was the fifth cause o f deathby infectious diseases. A recent measles immunizationcampaign&#13;
conducted by the government with support from UNICEFwas a success covering 7.3 million children, 93&#13;
percent o f the target population o f children between 6 months and 14 years. Duringthe last 4 5 years&#13;
outbreaks o f meningitis and cholera inLuanda and some southem and central provinces have put an&#13;
addedburden on an already weakened health system.&#13;
&#13;
One o f the most important diseases that are highly prevalent inthe northem areas o f the country i s&#13;
trypanosomiasis (sleeping siclaess). There i s a specialized autonomous institute set up to deal with the&#13;
disease and actions related to this disease should be includedinany basic healthcare interventioninthe&#13;
endemic areas.&#13;
&#13;
Tuberculosis prevalence i s increasing. Studies from 1990 estimate the annual infectionriskto be between&#13;
1.2-1.9 and the incidence to be o f 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Data from the tuberculosis program&#13;
for 2001(tuberculosis program annual report) reports more than 21,000 tuberculosis patients. Since&#13;
1996, the country has adoptedthe DOTS strategy for treatment but it only covers 44 o f 163 municipalities&#13;
inthe countryandlessthen 43 percento fthe population.&#13;
&#13;
AIDS epidemic&#13;
&#13;
HIV/AIDS i s a major health problem inAngola. The existingdata basedon surveys done by the National&#13;
Institute o f Healthand the Italian Cooperation shows a trend o f increasingprevalence inpregnant women&#13;
especially inLuanda and among sex workers. The National Program against A D S has developed a new&#13;
strategic plan for three years and i s inthe process o f launchingprojects basedon the plan. The National&#13;
Committee against AIDS has been approved inthe parliament and i s waiting for the approval o f the&#13;
regulation and the creation o f the secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
The HIV/AIDS pandemic has beenneglected and there are clear signs that the epidemic i s well&#13;
established inthe population and that incertain areas, such as Luanda, it is already inan explosive phase.&#13;
The most common ways of HIV transmission are heterosexual (55 percent o f all casesregistered by the&#13;
National Aids Program), mother to child transmission (14 percent), and bloodtransfusions (8 percent).&#13;
Local surveys done in2001 showed that almost 9 percent o fpregnant women inthe mainmatemity ward&#13;
inLuandahospitalwere HIVpositive. Thenumbers are evenworse inthe caseofsexuallytransmitted&#13;
infections, especially o f syphilis. Recent studies conducted by GOAL in2001 and by KPMP in2002 (two&#13;
international NGOs), showed that at voluntary counseling and testing clinics, 80.6 percent o fthe&#13;
attendees tested positive for syphilis. Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDSare associated. InAngola, 19percent&#13;
o f tuberculosis cases inthe maintuberculosis hospital test HIVpositive.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge o f HIV/AIDS and how to prevent it is low, and people continue to engage inrisky behaviors&#13;
that contribute to spreading the disease. The use of condoms is low even among sex workers who are&#13;
aware o fthe risks o f contracting sexually transmitted infections. According to the 2001 survey on&#13;
knowledge, attitudes and practice done by Population Services InternationalinLuanda only 43 percent o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
males and 40 percent of females aged 15 to 25 years useda condom duringtheir most recent sexual&#13;
encounter.&#13;
&#13;
Stigma associated with the disease i s high. Some 31percent o frespondents believed that to avoid spread&#13;
of the disease one should avoid social contacts with people living with aids. The Ministryo f Healthwith&#13;
support from the US.Center for Disease Control has recently begun a national serologic prevalence study&#13;
that will be finished by the end o f 2004 which i s expected to significantly improve knowledge o fthe&#13;
characteristics o f the pandemic inAngola.&#13;
&#13;
Health sector organization and management&#13;
&#13;
The govemment has made many attempts to elaborate a sound policy framework, decentralize decision&#13;
making, and deconcentrate health service delivery. Muchremains to be done to (a) adjust the institutional&#13;
and legal framework to the new roles and responsibilities o fthe different administrative levels (central,&#13;
intermediary, and local); (b) further decentralize decision malung; and (c) strengthen the capabilities o f&#13;
the healthprovincial and municipal healthdistricts to properlymanage human, financial, and other&#13;
categories o f resources. The national directorates, especially the ones linked to disease control, are&#13;
organized by diseases lines and are supportedvertically by donors and still need to elaborate sound&#13;
strategies o f intervention and actionplans.&#13;
&#13;
The healthsystem&#13;
&#13;
The health system includes a public system under the oversight o f the Ministry o fHealth that has a&#13;
networkof facilities inall the provinces witha three tier system of facilities: (a) the primary levelwith&#13;
healthposts, health centers and municipalhospitals; (b) a secondary level withprovincial hospitals&#13;
providing specialized assistance; and (c) a national tertiary levelwith specialized hospitals. There i s also&#13;
a military health subsystem with a central hospital and some regional hospitals. The private sector i s&#13;
characterized by the existence o f (a) a small but strong oil-related healthnetwork, limited to the oil&#13;
productionregions and serving mainly oil company workers and their families; (b) an expanding network&#13;
of not-for-profit NGO and church controlledhealthfacilities and systems; (c) a for-profit healthsystem&#13;
that provides services inthe main urban areas with very different levels o f quality; and (d) the traditional&#13;
health sector that is not regulated, but widely used inrural and urbanareas. The law o f 1992 loosely&#13;
regulates all these service providers.&#13;
&#13;
The recently approved health facility regulationdefines and characterizes the health facility network at all&#13;
levels, introduces the concept o fhealth area (municipality), and defines the functions and minimum&#13;
package o f services and o fhumanresources requiredby each service level. Unfortunately the sector was&#13;
not able untilnow to disseminate the regulationand support the provincial level services to apply it.&#13;
&#13;
Less than 35 percent of the population has access to a functioninghealth facility located within five&#13;
kilometers from their home. Many public healthcenters lack equipment for diagnosis and treatment and&#13;
transport and communications, essential drugs, and basic supplies. Healthproviders are often poorly&#13;
trained, nor are incentives inplace to rewardgood performance. Salaries were increased in2002 but not&#13;
by enough to boost productivity. During2003, the NationalDirectorate o fHuman Resources began&#13;
offering refresher training to existing nurses either from the govemment or from UNITA, and also began&#13;
to offer training to upgrade skills o f 1,200 o f 7,000 healthpromoters from UNITA and the govemment.&#13;
&#13;
According to the Ministryo f Health, Angola has about 40,000 healthworkers including some 700&#13;
medical doctors (more than 15,000 populationper doctor). The situation o f the healthpersonnel&#13;
compares poorly with the situation incountries with similar income levels and i s compounded by&#13;
geographical distributionproblems. For example, more than 70 percent o f the existing doctors are located&#13;
inLuanda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Budget process and sector financing&#13;
&#13;
The national budget i s managedby the Ministryo f Finance usingone instrument,the integrated state&#13;
financial system. The Ministry of Health at the central level is classified as a budget unit and manages the&#13;
budget o f the dependent unitssuch as the Directorate o fDrugs and Equipmentand the Directorate o f&#13;
Public Health. The provincial healthdirectorates depend on the budget o f the provincial governments that&#13;
is directly allocated by the Ministryof Finance and that now comes with salary budget line earmarkedby&#13;
sector. The Ministry o fHealth has little or no power to decide or influence the budgetallocationby&#13;
province (or by other decentralized budgetedunits)and even less to influence the real use o f the budget.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures inthe health sector have been increasing slightly since 2000. In2001, sector expenditures&#13;
were estimated at about US$19.1 per capita, nearly twice the expenditure o f the average for African low&#13;
income countries (about US$9.58 per capita).&#13;
&#13;
In2001,nearlyUS$13 millionwere spentondrugsandUS$16millioninthe controloftransmissible&#13;
diseases; about what was spent on overseas medical care. In2003 the Ministryo fHealthhas received&#13;
almost US$31millioninthe public investment program. Yet, differences inhealth expenditures by&#13;
province are large, revealing inequities that must now be redressed.&#13;
&#13;
In2000, therelativecontributionof donorstothehealthsectorbudgetwas24percent, withonly 10&#13;
percent o f the contributions directed to the central level. Insome provinces-BiC,   Bengo, Huambo,&#13;
Kuando-Kubango, Malange, Uige-the          donor contributionexceeded 50 percent o fthe provincial health&#13;
expenditures and indeed seemed to have substituted for the government.&#13;
&#13;
Projectjustification and target population&#13;
&#13;
As a priority, the government intends to correct the limitedcoverage o f good-quality basic health&#13;
services, particularly for mothers and children, particularly inthe provinces most affected by the war and&#13;
among the internally displacedpeople. The provinces chosen are Luanda, Kwanza-Norte, Malange, Uige,&#13;
Moxico and BiC. Because fundingis already available for healthinterventions inLuanda and Uige, the&#13;
Ministryof Healthhas suggested focusing projectinterventions inthe remainingfour provinces. Some&#13;
interventions-studies,    training, and provision of essential drugsupplies-will  be carried out nationwide.&#13;
&#13;
The targeted population comprises the poorest and most vulnerable groups inthe provinces and especially&#13;
innewlyaccessible areas. Almost 3.7 millionpeoplelive inthe four provinces coveredbythe project,&#13;
about half inthe 21 municipalities where project interventions will be concentrated. More then 700,000&#13;
are returnees recently arrived inthe communities.&#13;
&#13;
Program and project objectives and interventions&#13;
&#13;
The objectives o fthe proposedhealth subcomponent are to reduce the highmaternal and child mortality,&#13;
and reduce the incidence o f HIV/AIDS and o f sexually transmitted diseases in selected areas o f the&#13;
selected provinces. This will be achieved by increasing the coverage and improving the quality of&#13;
essentialprimary health care services to pregnant women and children, particularlythose displaced by the&#13;
war, byproviding a minimumpackage o f health care services inselected areas of the selected provinces,&#13;
training o f health care providers, providing essential medicines and supplies, strengthening efforts to&#13;
reduce the spread o f HIV/AIDS,and by strengthening the provincial and municipalhealthteams.&#13;

&#13;
  Component I:IncreaseAccess toprimary health services&#13;
&#13;
  The overarching objective o fthis component i s to increase accessto primary health services by increasing&#13;
  the number and spatial distribution o f health facilities and by designingand implementing an essential&#13;
  health care package o f interventions. The experience from the recent MinimumHealth Care and&#13;
  NutritionPackage Project held incollaboration with WHO inthe emergency response period will be the&#13;
  reference to develop the essential health care package. These would be provided at community, primary&#13;
  and secondary healthlevels, supported by decentralized and strengthened administrative, logistics and&#13;
  management systems. The essential health care package addressesthe major causes o f diseases,&#13;
  morbidity and mortality among the population, but takes into special consideration and targets the poor&#13;
  and the most vulnerable: women and children.&#13;
&#13;
  INCREASE ACCESS AND USEOF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
  Itis expected that, the training inintegratedmanagement o fchildhood illnesses will help with nutritional&#13;
  surveillance (based inthe baseline surveys) and inthe routine use o f the national growth cards, cases of&#13;
  undernourished children will be detected as well as some cases o f wasted and stunting children. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
project i s not providing food supplies for nutritional rehabilitation and therapeutic feeding. Nevertheless&#13;
the Ministry o fHealth at all levels will coordinate closely with the WFP, WHO, the Ministry o f Social&#13;
Action and Reintegration, andNGOs to ensure that women and children inneed o f nutritional support&#13;
receive it.&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase 1no civil works are planned. The architectural studies neededfor construction ofhealth&#13;
facilities planned for Phase 2 will be carried out through component C of the overallproject. A rapid&#13;
assessment o f the health posts and system will be carried out inthe four provinces and 21municipalities&#13;
covered by the project. The assessmentwill begin inMoxico incoordinationbetween the Ministry o f&#13;
Health and WHO. Itwill provide the basis for a health facility and health system mappingtool that can&#13;
be used by Ministry o f Health at provincial and central level for planning, monitoring, and decision&#13;
making purposes. Ambulances, motorcycles, and bicycleswill be procuredto ensure that all four&#13;
provincial capitals and selected municipalities have the means to send patients to referral units.&#13;
&#13;
INCREASEACCESS TO TREATMENTAND PREVENTIONOF COMMONILLNESSES&#13;
&#13;
This subcomponent will includesupport for malariacontrol, providingbednets, and antimalaria drugs in&#13;
line with the recent guidelines from the malaria program; tse-tse fly traps and tests for early detection and&#13;
treatment to combat trypanosomiasis; support to develop referral mechanisms to ensure that women&#13;
facing complications ofpregnancy and childbirth receive the care they need; support to promote early and&#13;
exclusive breast-feeding; and support for EPIactivities based on a strategy o f fixed post and routine&#13;
activities complemented by outreach activities, mobile teams, and special immunization days for polio&#13;
and measles. The project will support nutrition surveillance and education, therapeutic feeding, and&#13;
access to micronutrients (vitamin A and iodized salt), promotion of deworming, and use o f the child&#13;
growth card as an instrument for child healthand monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Improve the quality of health services&#13;
&#13;
The component will support the training o fhealth care providers and provision o fregular and adequate&#13;
supplies o f essential drugs and equipment. Even though the drugs to be procured and distributed will&#13;
benefit the target population, the quantity o f drugs to be procured will cover the needs of more&#13;
beneficiaries and could be usedto supplement the needs o fUige or even Luanda. The component&#13;
includes two subcomponents: training humanresources and providing essential medicines and supplies.&#13;
&#13;
T U N I N GHUMANRESOURCES&#13;
&#13;
The technical capacity requiredto provide good quality clinical andpreventiveservices will be improved&#13;
through provision o frefresher courses that will be organized for health professionals and for health&#13;
promoters who will be trained and promotedto auxiliary nurses. Because HIV/AIDS has permanently&#13;
changed the service delivery environment, all health personnel includingmidwives or nurses mustknow&#13;
how to counsel clients affected by A I D S and how to protect clients and themselves from infection.&#13;
Essential skills incounseling on HIVIAIDS will be given to healthprofessionals duringtraining.&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase 1anew curriculawill bepreparedfor the trainingo fnurses inemergency andessential&#13;
obstetric care, inthe treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and inhealth surveillance, including&#13;
epidemiological surveillance. Training will be carried out inthe four provinces using teams fiom the&#13;
provincial nursingschools and monitors from the National Directorate o f HumanResources and from&#13;
WHO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        the expected 7,000) from UNITA and from the government. They will be trained in integrated&#13;
        management o f childhood illnesses, family planning, and reproductive health services, including&#13;
        basic skills on prenatal care and emergency obstetric care. The curricula for this training have&#13;
        already beenprepared and almost 1,200 were trained, inaddition to 30 trainers onintegrated&#13;
        management o f childhood illnesses.&#13;
    0   Provide refresher training to the new health staff that has been recruited by the Ministry o fHealth&#13;
        on integrated management o f childhoodillnesses, family planning andreproductive healthto&#13;

Component 3: Strengthen activities to control andprevent sexually transmitted infections, HIV/!DS,and&#13;
tuberculosis&#13;
&#13;
The objective o f this component i s to implement the existingHIV/AIDS strategic plan and to ensure that&#13;
HN/AIDS control activities are given highpriority throughout government. Early diagnosis and&#13;
treatment for sexually transmitted infectionswill be improved and included inthe primary healthcare&#13;
package. The primary focus o f the project will be to promote an intense set o f behavior change&#13;
interventions targeted to specific vulnerable groups. The participationo f people livingwith AIDS will&#13;
also be promotedas a means o f fighting stigma and to give a voice to those most affected by the&#13;
epidemic. Special attention will be given to support the creation o f voluntary counseling and testing&#13;
services, especially for pregnant women, and supporting the expansion o f the epidemiological&#13;
surveillance network through sentinel sites. The project will have a strategy o f supporting the&#13;
introductiono f interventions to prevent mother to child transmission ina phased manner and where&#13;
technical conditions allow, but will not make it a priority. The project expects to implement the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
&#13;
  0    A knowledge, attitude, andpractices study, focal group discussion, or key informant interviews&#13;
       mustbeheldwith targetedriskgroups (truck drivers, prostitutes) andkey stakeholders, such as&#13;
       religious and traditional leaders and local authorities, inthe four provinces. Based inthe results o f&#13;
       the study NGOs and the provincial offices o f the Ministry of Health will develop and adapted set of&#13;
       information, education, and communication messages and materials for the behavior change&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      interventions that will be carried out with those groups, especially alongthe Malange transportation&#13;
      corridor.&#13;
      Increase awareness about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections inthe periurban andrural&#13;
      areas, through information, education, and communication campaigns. The campaigns will be&#13;
      conductedby healthprofessionals o f the Ministryo f Health and also byNGOs operating inthe&#13;
     priority municipalities.&#13;
     Use o fradio and other media will be encouraged and annually local radios will be contracted to&#13;
      disseminate information, education, and communication messages and radio spots prepared with&#13;
      support from experts from Ministryo f Health andNGOs.&#13;
     Development o f education activities among risk groups such as commercial sex worker and long&#13;
     distance drivers.&#13;
     Training o f health professionals on sexually transmitted infectionsyndrome management and on&#13;
     interpersonal communicationskills.&#13;
     Improvement o f the blood transfusion security inall provincial hospitals and health facilities that&#13;
     provide blood transfusions, by providing bloodtransfusion materials and HIV rapid tests for 1,800&#13;
     transfusions and specific training.&#13;
     Improvement o f the knowledge and practices o fhealth personnel on biosecurityto avoid nonsocial&#13;
     transmission.&#13;
     Usingexisting protocols inuse involuntary counseling and testing clinics inLuanda to support the&#13;
     training of two voluntary counseling and testing counselors per province and study the creation o f&#13;
     voluntary counseling and testing centers inat least the four provincial hospitals.&#13;
     Support of diagnosis and screening of sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis, through&#13;
     use o f rapid tests.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: Institutional strengthening&#13;
&#13;
The objectives o f this component are to improve the capacity o f the sector to manage the increased&#13;
demand for services and to decentralize the analytical and decision making capacities to the provincial&#13;
and municipallevels; to provide neededtechnical support to the weakened provincial and municipal&#13;
health structures; and to revise and adapt the existing health policy, prepare a coherent health strategy and&#13;
medium-term health development plan.&#13;
&#13;
STRENGTHENINGCAPACITY OF MUNICIPAL             AND PROVINCIAL HEALTH      TEAMS ON BASICHEALTH&#13;
PLANNINGAND MANAGEMENT.&#13;
&#13;
One critical aspect o f the program i s to strengthen the management capacities of healthteams to plan and&#13;
manage sector activities at the provincial and municipal levels. This will be achieved throughthe&#13;
provision o f specific training on basic management, including planningtechniques and methodologies.&#13;
The provincial and municipal teams will also receive training inthe use o fthe simplified information&#13;
system, integrated inthe training on management and planning techniques. This will be achieved in&#13;
Phase 1by:&#13;
&#13;
  e  Preparing terms o freference for and contracting primary health care teams or qualifiedNGOs for&#13;
     each province to provide support to the municipalities and provincial healthdirectorates.&#13;
  e  Training o f at least 50 percent o f municipal healthteams inthe prioritized municipalitiesinbasic&#13;
     health management and planningtechniques to prepare the way for the decentralization process&#13;
     intended by the government, and allowing also a better participation o f the primary care level and&#13;
     the communities.&#13;
 e   Developing, with the National Directorate o f Human Resources, National Directorate o f Public&#13;
     Health, and support from WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA, supervision mechanisms and skills inthe&#13;
     provincial directorate and municipal health authorities, and ensuringregular supervision visits to&#13;
     the health facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0   Reviewing and simplifyingthe existing healthinformation systemto make it easier to use at all&#13;
       levels, and to provide essential information for decision making. Duplicate and disseminate&#13;
       standard forms and ensure the flow o f information.&#13;
   0   Collecting, processing, and analyzing, as well as providing feedback o f essential health information&#13;
       for decision making; and supporting the execution o fbaseline and evaluation surveys when needed.&#13;
&#13;
 SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY AND HEALTHDEVELOPMENTPLAN&#13;
&#13;
 The program will support the design through a participatory approach o f a national health policy and the&#13;
 medium-term health development plan (2007-12). This activity i s expected to help strengthen the&#13;
 capacities o f the Ministryof Health and the national directorates, and improve the relationship and lines&#13;
 of communicationwithinthe various directorates andbetween the central, provincial, and municipal&#13;
 health institutions. This will be achieved by:&#13;
&#13;
 0     Preparing terms o f reference and program o f activities to contract specialized technical assistance in&#13;
       healthpolicy andplanning to help the Ministry o f Healthcounterparts indesigning the revised&#13;
       health policy and strategic plan.&#13;
 0     Preparing and implementing consultative meetings with partners such as nonprofit sector, churches,&#13;
       an the like for the redefinition o fthe nationalhealthpolicy and the design o f the national strategic&#13;
       healthplan.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   PHASE 2&#13;
&#13;
 Component 1:Increase access toprimary health services&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase2, activities willprovide the resources to repair, rehabilitate, or rebuild65 healthposts, 13&#13;
health centers, and selected facilities inthe four provincial hospitals, such as operating theaters, based on&#13;
 standardratios between population andhealthfacilities definedby the Ministryo fHealth. Itwill also&#13;
 support limited rehabilitation o f the Malange healthschool that has teaching teams that will provide&#13;
training to the region, includingKwanza Norte and Moxico. Finally, it will support rehabilitation o ftwo&#13;
warehouses for drugs.&#13;
&#13;
The healthunits that will be rehabilitated with programresources will also needto be staffed with&#13;
personnel that that i s beingrecruited and trained withinthe existingMinistry o fHealthprogram. The&#13;
program will cover the costs of training this staff particularly the nurses andauxiliary nurses that will&#13;
needrefresher training. Some of this training has begun inPhase 1, Based on existing ratios defined in&#13;
the Regulamento das Unidades Sanitarias it i s estimated that to provide services for the almost 1.8 million&#13;
direct beneficiaries o f the healthcomponent, 36 medical doctors, 360 nurses, 720 auxiliary nurses, 30&#13;
laboratorytechnicians, 30 pharmacists, and 10 administrative staff will needto be recruited. This&#13;
numbers are indicative and will eventually change during the life o f the program. This intervention will&#13;
be coordinated closely with the provincial governments to take into consideration the existing investment&#13;
of the government inthe four provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INCREASE ACCESS TO AND USEOF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase 2, this subcomponent will continueproviding the essential drugs, andtrainingrelatedto&#13;
integrated management of childhood illnesses and essential and emergency obstetric care. Specifically, it&#13;
will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Harmonize the interventionwith ongoing rehabilitationhealth facilities funded by the&#13;
        government, to avoid duplication. Use the existing standard type o f health facilities o f the&#13;
        MinistryofHealthas a reference fro rehabilitation.&#13;
        Rehabilitate, repair, or construct healthposts, health centers and municipalreference centers and&#13;
        some specific facilities inprovincial hospitals that will have impact inmaternal and child&#13;
        mortality such as surgicalwards, blood bank, emergency rooms. provide essential medical&#13;
        equipment and furniture to health facilities and ensure that they meet standards for clean water&#13;
        and sanitation.&#13;
        Prepare guidelines by the bureauo f planning o fMinistryo f Health or the organization (NGO or a&#13;
        contractor) contracted to do the rehabilitation, for minimal maintenanceto the repaired buildings.&#13;
        Contract teams o f specialists to include surgery, intemalmedicine and pediatrics that will&#13;
        guarantee access to quality services at referral level infour provincial hospitals for the life o f the&#13;
       EMRP(see paragraphon implementationstrategy).&#13;
       Provide vehicles for referral o fpatients and for logistics and supervision, adopting a policy aimed&#13;
       to involve local authorities and maximizing the use ofresources.&#13;
&#13;
INCREASEACCESS TO TREATMENTAND PREVENTIONOF COMMON ILLNESSES&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase2, this subcomponent will continue withthe interventions initiatedduringPhase 1.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Improve the Quality of Health Care Services&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase2, thiscomponent will continue to support improvements inthe quality o fhealth services&#13;
through training o f health staff, and through provision o f regular and adequate supplies o f essential drugs&#13;
and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
TRAINHUMANRESOURCES&#13;
&#13;
The technical capacity required to provide good quality clinical and preventive services will continue to&#13;
be improved throughrefresher courses that where initiatedduringPhase 1. These include:&#13;
&#13;
       Training and promotingto auxiliary nurse 1,200 healthpromoters (out of the expected 7,000)&#13;
       from UNITA and from the govemment. They will be trained inintegratedmanagement o f&#13;
       childhood illnesses, family planning, and reproductive health services, including basic skills on&#13;
       prenatal care and emergency obstetric care.&#13;
       Refresher training for laboratory technicians andblood transfusion providers inthe four provinces&#13;
       will continue as well as the internships for nurses and doctors and refresher training incommon&#13;
       diseases to include treatment for malaria and sexually transmitted infections.&#13;
       Supervision and on-the-job training o f the nurses trained inPhase 1will be carriedout regularly&#13;
       by teams comprising Ministryo fHealth officers andprovincial healthpersonnelwith the support&#13;
       o f WHO.&#13;
       The training on integrated management o f childhood illnesses, essential and emergency obstetric&#13;
       care, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV to ensure drugs are used appropriately.&#13;
&#13;
INCREASING ACCESS TO ESSENTIALDRUGS AND SUPPLIES&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase2, this subcomponent will include:&#13;
       Provision o fkits o f essential drugs to healthposts, health centers and municipal hospitals, to&#13;
       include reproductive healthkits, tripanosomiasis drugs for specific endemic areas, as well as&#13;
       ferrous sulfate, folic acid, vitamin A and deworming drugs for children and women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0    Assessment of potential o fproviding antiretrovirals to prevent mother to child transmission o f&#13;
         AIDS, assuming that the "3 by 5" initiative o f WHO has beenput into place inAngola.&#13;
    0    Providing, laboratory tests to the four provincial hospitals for sexually transmitted infections,&#13;
         HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria allowing better and more precise diagnosis. The laboratory&#13;
         technicians will be trained on the use o f these new technologies.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Strengthen activities to control andprevent sexually transmitted infections, HIVAIDS, and&#13;
tuberculosis&#13;
&#13;
DuringPhase2, the interventions to preventthe spreado fHIV/AIDS will focus exclusivelyonthe&#13;
information, education, and communication activities at the municipal and provincial levels through&#13;
NGOsand the Ministry o fHealth, andthrough radio andother media. Specific training incase&#13;
management o f sexually transmitted infections and the expansion o f voluntary counseling and testing&#13;
activities will also be pursued as inPhase 1.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: Institutional strengthening&#13;
&#13;
The objectives o f this component are: to improve the capacity o f the sector to manage the increased&#13;
demand for services and to decentralize the analytical and decision making capacities to the provincial&#13;
and municipal levels; to provide needed technical support to the weakened provincial and municipal&#13;
health structures; and to revise and adapt the existinghealth policy, prepare a coherent health strategy and&#13;
midtermhealthdevelopment plan for the consolidation phase.&#13;
&#13;
STRENGTHENING CAPACITY OF MUNICIPALAND PROVINCIAL HEALTH TEAMS ON BASIC HEALTH&#13;
PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
Phase 2 will maintain the provision o f specific training on basic management, including planning&#13;
techniques and methodologies. The provincial and municipal teams will also receive training inthe use&#13;
of the simplified information system, integrated inthe management and planning train.&#13;
&#13;
SUPPORTREVIEWOF THE NATIONAL HEALTHPOLICY AND MEDIUM-TERM HEALTHPLAN&#13;
&#13;
The programwill support the finalization o f the nationalhealthpolicy and the medium-termhealth&#13;
development plan (2007-12). The final policy and plan will be based on work carried out duringPhase 1,&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
&#13;
The PMrUwill be responsible for procurement and financial management. The planningbureau o f the&#13;
Ministry o f Health will be responsible for coordinating activities among the participating entities: the&#13;
national directorates of humanresources, public health, drugs and equipment, entities carrying out&#13;
rehabilitationand health sector emergency program, and the provincial health directorates.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Health will nominate a focal point to follow-up to the activities and to participate in&#13;
meetings and other coordination activities. The planningbureau will decide whether to appoint someone&#13;
from within the ministryor to contract under project finance an independent consultant for this task.&#13;
&#13;
The technical directorates within the Ministryo f Health, will prepare the biddingdocuments and the&#13;
terms o freferences for consultancies. The planningbureau will review and comment on the documents&#13;
and provide them to the PMIUfor inclusioninthe tender documents. The ministrywill receive support&#13;
and technical assistance from WHO, UNICEFand UNFPAfor training and procurement o f drugs,&#13;
organizations with which it has several ongoing projects. Duringthe next 3-6 months the planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bureau will draw on the expertise o fthe project implementation unit o fthe Bank-supported HIV/AIDS,&#13;
Malaria, Sexually TransmittedInfections, and Tuberculosis Project to assist with procurement documents.&#13;
&#13;
Role of NGOs&#13;
&#13;
Given the limited capacity of the Ministryo f Health at the provincial level, the government i s considering&#13;
partneringwith NGOsto execute some project activities. The participation o fNGOs or other partners&#13;
will be regulated by appropriate norms laidout inoperating manuals and standard contracts to be&#13;
developed under the Project Preparation Facility by the PMIU. NGOs could be involved inthe following&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
Increase access toprimaly health sewices. NGOs have some experience inrehabilitationo fhealth&#13;
facilities, but they normally use an emergency approach. With access to adequate funding, some will able&#13;
to manage the rehabilitationof healthposts. Inmunicipalities where NGOs are present and the project&#13;
will have activities it is highlyrecommended that the rehabilitation o fthe healthfacilities be undertaken&#13;
bythe NGOunderthe norms defined bythe PIU.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthen the quality of health careservices. NGOs can be contractedto provide trainingto health&#13;
professionals, using the manuals approved by the Ministry o f Health. To maximize the expertise o fthe&#13;
NGO, they should work inclose relationship with the provincialDirectorate o f HumanResources andthe&#13;
nursingschool of the province and provide training to all the healthpersonnel and promoters inthe&#13;
province. It shouldbe possible for the NGO especially to contribute inthe following training:&#13;
Management o f health services at primary health care; integrated management o f childhood illnesses;&#13;
Common Diseases inadults with focus in STDs/HN/AIDS; Safe motherhood to include Emergency&#13;
Obstetric. There i s competitive advantage to use the already well established procedure o f essential drug&#13;
kits acquisition and distribution, by the Ministryof Healthprogram usingthe project PIU. Nevertheless&#13;
NGOscould have a significant role insupporting the provincial and municipal authorities inmanaging&#13;
the stock o f drugs and also in controlling the distribution and the management o f stocks inthe health&#13;
facilities. Some o f the NGOs could even provide medical specialists inthe areas o f surgery, pediatrics,&#13;
and gynecology and obstetrics to work inthe provincial hospitalsupporting the improvement o f the&#13;
quality of care and helping inmanaging the institution.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthen activities to control sexually transmitted infections and HIWAIDS. This requires extensive&#13;
use o f techniques and skills incommunicationand community organization and mobilization for behavior&#13;
change. The Ministryo fHealth has limited expertise inthese areas and has inadequate capacity o f&#13;
reaching the target groups o f truck drivers, sex workers, and road construction crews. Therefore, these&#13;
interventions will be implemented by NGOs operating inthe provincethat will be contracted following&#13;
the proceduresput inplace by the PMlU.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthen the health sector institutions. NGOscould provide the directorates with expertise onjob&#13;
training and hands on experience inprogramming activities, managing the budget, preparingthe annual&#13;
plan of activities and budget, develop supervision manuals and procedures, improving the HIMS and the&#13;
epidemiological surveillance systems inplace and help inthe monitoring and quality assurance o f the&#13;
services. A selected number o fNGOs acting inAngola (for example, Save the Children-UK; CARE;&#13;
WorldVision; CCF; Africare) are capable and have experience inAfiica and elsewhere inproviding&#13;
direct support to define priorities, policies, and strategies to support the healthreform process, and to&#13;
develop teaching manuals for the healthteaching institutions. NGOs may also be key partners inthe&#13;
process o fpreparingthe provincial healthplans by providing direct support to the provincial health&#13;
directorate and to the central level Ministry o f Health team that are inthe process o fpreparingthe&#13;
diagnosis for the 59 prioritizedmunicipalities.&#13;

                          Health facilities rehabilitation, repair, and construction&#13;
&#13;
                                             PHASE1PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
A rapid inventory andneeds assessmentofthe health infrastructure ofprovinces is needed. The&#13;
provinces and the Ministryof Healthprovideda first list o f healthfacilities to be rehabilitated. The&#13;
provincialhospitals require primarily repairs o f specific facilities, upto an aggregate amount o f&#13;
US$300,000. The healthposts inBiCand Moxico and some o fthe healthcenters are heavily damaged&#13;
and extensive rehabilitation i s necessary, at an estimated cost o fUS$200,000 to US$300,000 each.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministryo f Health will contract, under the PPF, an architectural firmthat will provide the final&#13;
evaluation, scope o f work and costs for the various healthfacilities, allowing for a final and accurate&#13;
prioritization o f the rehabilitation to be carried out. This firmwill also produce the tender documents for&#13;
the different lots to be presented inthe biddingprocess.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    PHASE2&#13;
&#13;
Inmany cases firms willbe contractedto execute the works. Butother solutionswill also be considered,&#13;
including the use o fNGOs and targeted support from the Social Action FundProject, which has&#13;
significant experience inconstructing healthposts To ensure goodperformance o f the health staff, a&#13;
minimal rehabilitationand equipment program will be implementedincombination with the&#13;
establishment o fprovisional facilities using clear procurement procedures and supporting the use o f local&#13;
contractors and involvement o f local resources and community capacities, wherever possible. The quality&#13;
control of the rehabilitatedfacilities will be done inconjunctionby the provincial directorates o f health&#13;
and civil works and construction.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement and distribution of drugs, health supplies, andfurniture&#13;
&#13;
                                             PHASE1PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
A list o frequiredequipment and fumiture will be preparedbythe construction unitofthe Ministryo f&#13;
Health and the Directorate o fDrugs and Equipment, based on the existing standard lists and providedto&#13;
the Ministryo f Planning. The itemswill be procured either directly or included inthe tender documents&#13;
for the rehabilitationo f health facilities. The Ministryo f Health Directorate o f Drugswill also prepare&#13;
the lists and technical documents for the acquisition o f the various drugkits and laboratory materials and&#13;
will work inclose collaborationwith the PMIUto preparetender documents and evaluate bids. The first&#13;
procurement o f drugs will be done duringPhase 1and simultaneously there will be a drugs needs&#13;
assessment done by an external consultant that will also provide expertise infinalizing the tender&#13;
documents for the ICB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    PHASE2&#13;
&#13;
The procurement o f the kits of drugs will preferably be done inone single bid, which will then be&#13;
delivered to the country annually. The selected contractors will be obligated to deliver the essential drug&#13;
kits, equipment, and furniture will be obligated to deliver the goods to at least to the provincial capitals&#13;
and, ifpossible, to the municipalities. To ensure that the drugs reach the municipalities and the health&#13;
posts and health centers, the cost incurredby the municipalities or communities to pick up the kits will be&#13;
reimbursedby the project as part o f the operating costs. It is recommended that some kits o f drugs and&#13;
medical supplies, such as the ones related to reproductive healthbe procureddirectly through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
UNIPACand UNFPAsystems and that there is coordination withthese organizations to use their&#13;
logistical system to distribute the drugs to all the targeted areas, or at least to the provincial capitals.&#13;
&#13;
The equipment to be purchased is not complex and the Ministry o fHealth can guarantee basic preventive&#13;
maintenance and cleaning. For any equipment requiringspecializedmaintenance (such as electric&#13;
equipment) the Ministryo fHealthwill underwrite contracts with firms located inAngola that normally&#13;
provide this kindo f services to the Ministryo f Health.&#13;
&#13;
Human resources developnient and training&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Health i s inthe initial phases o f implementing a program that will increase the number o f&#13;
healthprofessionals inthe public health systemto respond to the increasedneed o f staffing the newly&#13;
accessible areas. This program will recruit more than 3,000 nurses and auxiliary nurses that are now&#13;
outside the system and upgrade to the level o f auxiliary nurses more than 6,000 promoters from UNITA&#13;
and from the govemment. The project will support this effort.&#13;
&#13;
The refresher training i s expected to be carried out inthe provinces or at the regional level. Courses will&#13;
last no more than two weeks for each group o f trainees. The refresher training will use the existing&#13;
technical protocols for integrated management o f childhood illnesses, reproductive health, sexually&#13;
transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS to improve the capacities o f the recruited staff for case&#13;
management. NGOs may be contracted to provide the training. With the expansion of the training in&#13;
integrated management o f childhood illnesses and common diseases, the need for specific training on&#13;
rational use o f drugs should be revised and instead the programshould focus on supervising and&#13;
supporting drugmanagement.&#13;
&#13;
Training materials and norms will be produced inadequate quantities to cover all the training needs&#13;
duringthe two phases. The cost o fmaterials is includedinthe unitcost for training eachperson. Other&#13;
learningmaterials such as the information, education, and communicationmaterials will be duplicated&#13;
and distributed for all the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional strengthening&#13;
&#13;
The govemment recognizes that to rapidly increase the provision o fhealth services will require&#13;
innovative approaches and partnerships with NGOs. NGOs with experience inproviding health services&#13;
will be contracted under results-based contract agreements. Some o fthese organizations could eventually&#13;
contract nationals (nurses, doctors, auxiliary nurses) to ensure sustainability o f service provision. The&#13;
NGOs that will work with thisprogram will be encouraged to have their community volunteers, including&#13;
traditional birthattendants, trained as educators and behavior change agents on maternal health and able&#13;
to recognize danger signs relatedto pregnancy and delivery and to organize prompt referrals.&#13;
&#13;
Special efforts will also be made to expand the coverage o f primary healthcare inthe provinces through&#13;
the establishment o f one primary care healthteam ineach province. Eachteam will be chargedwith&#13;
providing the teams with the basic healthcare package based on the minimumhealth andnutrition care&#13;
package that the Ministry o f Health identifiedjointly withWHO, UNFPAand UNICEFinJune 2002. In&#13;
addition, the primaryhealthcare team will be responsible for ensuring that health staff intheir geographic&#13;
areas are trained and supervised and for assisting the municipal andprovincial teams inplanning,&#13;
supervising, and monitoring their healthactivities. The personnel assigned to the primary health care&#13;
team will rely on the technical back-up by medical specialists who will be basedinregional hospitals and&#13;
charged with the responsibilityfor providing referrals to people inneed o f hospital care. Procurement for&#13;
the primary health care teams that will provide support to the provincial and municipal Ministryo f Health&#13;
teams will allow for NGOs or individual consultants to provide the service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 The primary health care teams and the municipal and provincialhealth authorities are expected to have a&#13;
 planningmeeting annually to evaluate the work done and prepare plans for the next year. These&#13;
 provincial programs will be thenpresented and discussed inan interprovincial meetingwith the central&#13;
 level o f the Ministryof Healthto ensure strategic coordination.&#13;
&#13;
 Monitoringand evaluation&#13;
                                             PHASE1PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
 Duringproject implementation regular monitoringwillbe carriedout.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   PHASE2&#13;
&#13;
The sector must define clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, procedures, and techniques to&#13;
improve the quality and quantity o f data for decision making. The process will entail regular, at least&#13;
quarterly, visits from the central level teams to the provinces where the advances and constraints inthe&#13;
process o f implementationwill be analyzed and appropriate solutions discussed and adopted. Plans for&#13;
next period will be designed with the provincial and municipal authorities. It is expected that the&#13;
provincial primary health care teams will visit the municipalities under their responsibility at least once a&#13;
month. Duringthe visits, the teams will monitor what has been and the constraints, and guide the staff in&#13;
ways to overcome the constraints. The existing health infomation systemwith all its components o f&#13;
epidemiology and disease surveillance, service utilization data, financial management, human resources&#13;
management would be reviewed and adapted to the specific situation and to the fact that there will be the&#13;
needo f more timely informationover a larger area and with anew health staff.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministryo f Health in coordination with the WorldBank-supported HAMSET Project will prepare a&#13;
hospitalhealth facility waste management strategy and programthat will help indefining solutions for the&#13;
management o f waste inthe health facilitiesrepairedrehabilitated. These solutions must be simple&#13;

&#13;
The Ministryo f Healthmust draw on the experience collected inthe recent supervision process developed&#13;
under the minimumhealthcare and nutrition package to develop a routine supervision system for the four&#13;
priority provinces. The supervision must be done at least once every four months and shouldbe&#13;
analytical and supportive to the provincial directorate. At the provincial level the Directorate o f Public&#13;
Health must prepare a similar program to provide regular educational supervision to the staff o fmunicipal&#13;
healthfacilities, eventually inpartnership with the NGOspecialist involved with clinical specialists from&#13;
the provincial hospital. This i s crucial to support the implementation o f the integrated management o f&#13;
childhood illnesses strategies.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry o f Healthwill also make regular use o f complementary information gathered through&#13;
surveys such as health facility surveys; knowledge, practices and coverage surveys, or the multiple&#13;
indicator cluster survey 2, and other methods. The results o f these studies can be used to support the&#13;
detailed planning o f actions at provincial and municipal levels. Because this task requires time and&#13;
qualifiedpeople, the Ministryo f Health should coordinate closely with NGOsworking inthe provinces.&#13;

Ongoinghealthsector support by internationaland nationalstakeholders&#13;
&#13;
The government has begun to provide a special budgetary allocation o f almost US$20 million to the&#13;
provinces most affected by war to allow preparation and implementation o f activities during2003-04. In&#13;
BiC,the local authorities plan to allocate about 20 percent o fthis amount to improve andrehabilitate the&#13;
health infrastructure. Delays infunds disbursement are hampering the implementation o f the activities.&#13;
The Ministry o f Healthhas receivedUS$36.5 million for central level operations inthe public investment&#13;
program for 2003. Nearly U S 6 million of this has been allocated to rehabilitate the Malange hospital,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
and provide equipment to municipal health facilities inMalange, Moxico, Uige and three other provinces.&#13;
The Social Action Fundis launchingits thirdphase, with a total estimated amount o f US$200 million that&#13;
can support the coverage o f some o fthe healthrehabilitation interventions inselected municipalities,&#13;
depending on community demand and on beinginone o f their prioritizedprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
WHO i s providing a total o fUS$17 million for healthinterventions intheir regular annual operational&#13;
plan that will cover some o f the activities programmed for the priority phase. About US$10-11 million&#13;
o f the reources are earmarked for health services and prevention interventions and US$6 million for water&#13;
and sanitation to support interventions duringthe emergency and reintegration period. UNFPA is ina&#13;
transition period and for 2004 will only have US$1 million to develop on going operations but expects for&#13;
the period 2005-08 to have US$8 million for human resources to include clearer interventionfor control&#13;
o f HIV/AIDS especially dedicated to youth. UNICEF i s providing support to the sector mainly inthe EPI&#13;
program and polio eradicationinitiative and i s preparing to provide further support to the reactivation o f&#13;
the EPIroutine vaccination activities and a special program to significantly diminishthe burdeno f&#13;
measles inchildren. UNICEFhas US$8 million for 2002-03 to implement the measles campaign inthe&#13;
country which has been a success, and i s applying US$3.5 million &amp;om the EuropeanUnion for health&#13;
interventions, including nutrition. The limitations on emergency funds to the UNagencies such as WHO,&#13;
UNICEF,UNFPA, that inthe recent years were directly involved inhealthinterventions inselected&#13;
provinces and at times inall the territory, will make continuation o f the programs difficult.&#13;
&#13;
The EuropeanUnion i s also giving, under the eighthEuropeanDevelopment Fund,more than 30 million&#13;
euros for healthinterventionsinHuambo, Huila, Bie and Benguela. A special program totaling        E  60&#13;
million has beenpreparedto support the reconstruction process and its use will be decentralized to the&#13;
provinces and to priority municipalities to reactivated services such as education, health and&#13;
administrative services. The ninthEDF is already being prepared for a horizon o f 2007 and beyond.&#13;
&#13;
USAJDhas beenproviding humanitarian aid to Angola through multilateral organizations or directly&#13;
through international NGOs. USAID i s directing its interventions on populationresettlement and&#13;
reintegration for a period o f24 months, to include food security, agriculture, health, HIV/AIDS and&#13;
democratic development. It i s providing about US$lO million for health interventions focusing on&#13;
HIV/AIDS diagnosis (with the Center for Disease Control as the implementingagency) and on social&#13;
marketing o f condoms (with PopulationServices International). USAID i s targeting the provinces o f BiC,&#13;
Malange, Huila, Kuanza-Sul, Huambo and Benguela. USAID is now refocusing their fundingpriorities,&#13;
and has budgeted for the next fiscal year, US$2.5 million for HIV/AIDS, US$1millionfor family&#13;
planning, US$1.25 millionfor maternal and child health, US$2.3 million for polio and US$l million for&#13;
malaria. USAID i s also providing 20 million condoms annually for prevention o f sexually transmitted&#13;
infections, including four million that are given to the FAA medical service.&#13;
&#13;
The African Development Bank has already begun a US$6.5 million, three-year healthproject, focusing&#13;
mainly in the province o f Uige and can eventually support the HIV/AIDS program with US$1 million&#13;
more.&#13;
&#13;
SIDA is financing reproductivehealthwith US$4million inthree years, mainly inLuanda andHuila.&#13;
Belgium provides US$4 million to control tripanosomiases. Japan i s financing a US$39 million&#13;
rehabilitation project inLuanda. Italy i s preparing a US$10 million project to finance health interventions&#13;
inHuilaand Uige andto providetechnical assistanceto the bureauo fplanning. The project will directly&#13;
support interventions at the provincial level inmalaria control, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted&#13;

D)       Health needs and resources assessmentinMoxico province&#13;
&#13;
The government has received a grant from the IDA to implement the EMRP, and intends to use those&#13;
funds towards the preparation o fthe interventiono fthe subcomponent "Increased access to Health&#13;
services". This requires conducting a health facility assessment and basic inventory.&#13;
&#13;
An HealthFacilities Assessment is focused onthe collection o frelevant informationonthe location&#13;
name, type and status o f the health facility, number ofhealthworkers available and other key indicators&#13;
such as access to the facility, availability of essential drugs. This informationhas to be integrated ina set&#13;
o f tables and its better use i s when it can be plotted ina Map and compared with information about&#13;
resources and for example roads and locationo f villages.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it is neededto develop innovative tools to identify the priority areas where new health facilities&#13;
could be established or the existing rehabilitated.&#13;
&#13;
The WHO i s ina process of developing a case study on the use o f the healthmapper GIS developed by&#13;
WHO that will be use for this purpose&#13;
&#13;
Itis expectedthat the informationgatheredwill helpthe MOHat provinciallevelto have accessto the&#13;
tool that will help inthe planning, management and supervision process. Besides the intervention will&#13;
provide basic information about the healthnetwork inthe municipalities were the EMRPwill conduct&#13;
rehabilitations and contribute to the capacity buildingo f the MOH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The intervention will be focusinginMoxico and in4 o fits municipalities and will be executedbythe&#13;
MOHwith direct support o f WHO.&#13;
&#13;
Usingsystemic Problem Solving Approach (PSA) and causal analysis to design realistic health action&#13;
Indicators will structure the entire architecture o f the programplanningprocess. The interventionwill&#13;

     9 Theselection ofrelevant interventions&#13;
&#13;
The implementation and evaluation o f selected Health actions, geared towards priority problem solving.&#13;
&#13;
The project i s assumed to have a total o f three months period.&#13;
Enough time has to be dedicated for the assessment and collection o f the existing relevant data that are&#13;
already available in Luanda or inthe provincial level before conducting the data collection to the field.&#13;
Potential organizations, both govemment and non govemment, could be Ministry o f Health (Angola),&#13;
OCHA, INE, WHO (various unitsmust be consulted), UNHCR, UNDP, UNSECOORD, UNICEF,&#13;
UNAIDS.&#13;
&#13;
Training will be organized inLuena for the selected staffbased on the WHOMOH criteria. The training&#13;
includes on how to use GPS for collecting the location o f the health facility, downloading the collected&#13;
data into a computer and organizing the database.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the collected data will be processed and made available to all interested usinghealthmapper&#13;
software. It i s recommended to organize a final workshop for field operators including govemment&#13;
institutions to informthe outcomes and the benefitsto the province. Data will be centralized at DPS but&#13;
processed through the three focal points-MOH-GP;WHO and the provincial govemment.&#13;
&#13;
Before the action occurs a detailed agreement must be signed between WHO and the MOH-GP to cany&#13;
out the interventions and to mobilize the resources from the EMRP and from they province.&#13;
The assessment will be carried out duringthe second semester o f 2004 and a report describing the results,&#13;
and the process utilized and proposing next steps for scaling up the experience must be prepared and&#13;
approved by the MOH.&#13;

&#13;
Inthe context ofthe EMRPthe following criteriawere appliedto select interventions inthe education&#13;
sector: (a) a focus on severely underserved provinces; (b) assurancethat the project finances a complete&#13;
package o f educational inputs and services inthe selected provinces (classrooms, teacher preparation,&#13;
educational materials, and training); (c) consistent with guidance from the Ministries o fPlanningand&#13;
Finance and sector authorities; and (d) promotion o f linkages with parallel interventions inhealth, rural&#13;
development, water, and sanitation. Based on these criteria, the activities to improve education will take&#13;
place inthe provinces o f Malanje, Moxico, Uige, Bie and Kuanza Norte.&#13;
&#13;
The EMRPcontribution for education is expectedto be around US$41.5 million, equivalent to about 23&#13;
percent o f the overall cost o fthe education interventions inthe PPMRRP (US$176 million).' The&#13;
objectives o fthe proposed education interventions are to: (a) improve the quality o f education; (b)&#13;
increase access to and completion o f grades 1-6; and (c) strengthen institutional capacity to improve data&#13;
collection, analysis and planning, and school level management. The education component will be&#13;
executed intwo phases with the first phase expected to cost US$7 million (US$5 million from IDA and&#13;
US$1.8 million from government) andthe second phase expected to cost US$34 million (US$25 million&#13;
from IDA and US$9 million from government). Table 1summarizes the design and cost estimates o f the&#13;

Phase I Project Activity I:Improving the quality of education (total Cost, US$5.6million, of whichIDA&#13;
will contribute US$4 million)&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe first phaseproject activities will cover providing textbooks, teacher guides and other didactic&#13;
materials including student and teacher kits and classroomposters to allprimary school students and&#13;
teachers inthe five provinces. The textbooks and teacher guides will focus on the core subjects including&#13;
mathematics and Portuguese, and integrated sciences. These materials are expectedto last three years.&#13;
HIV/AIDSprevention informationmaterials would also be distributedto allthe primary classrooms. The&#13;
project will also initiate training for about 1,379 new teachers who will be posted inthe new schools,&#13;
usingmodules and materials developedandtested withthe support fromUNICEF and other agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Providing pedagogical materials. The programwill support the provisionand distribution o fteacher and&#13;
student guides to assist the main areas ofthe curriculum, including Mathematics, Portuguese, and&#13;
Integrated Sciences. It should be notedthat most materials for grades 1to 6 have already been&#13;
developed, therefore, financing will only be required for printingand distribution. These materials will be&#13;
distributed to all primary school students and teachers inthe five provinces duringthe first year o f&#13;
program implementation. It i s expected that these materials would last three years. Basic pedagogical&#13;
materials for each classroom would also be distributed, among these, HIV/AIDSprevention information&#13;
materials would be distributed.&#13;
&#13;
Providing didactic materials. The programwill provide and distribution an essential package o f didactic&#13;
materials for students inthe proposednew schools including pens, pencils, erasers, and notebooks, chalk,&#13;
paper. Kits will be distributed to all primary school students and teachers annually for the three year&#13;
period inthe five selected provinces.&#13;
&#13;
Providing teacher training. Teacher development courses for new teachers as well as for those teachers&#13;
currently displaced who planned to be resettled innew areas will be conducted. It shouldbe noted that&#13;
during2001/2002 the EuropeanUnionandUNICEFhavebeen deliveringtraining courses to upgrade&#13;
primary school teachers (240 hours o ftraining over 3 months with a unit cost o f 280 euros per trained&#13;
teacher plus administration and overhead). The component will provide financing for teacher&#13;
developmentlupgrading courses for an additional 1,379 new teachers who will be posted inthe new&#13;
schools. The training will rely on modules and materials developed and tested with the support from&#13;
UNICEFand other agencies, thus complementinginter-agency efforts.&#13;

Phase I Project Activity 2: Build institutional capacity (Total Cost, US$0.4 million, of whichIDA will&#13;
contribute US$O.28million)&#13;
&#13;
Phase 1of the project will also finance technical assistance to establish minimumimplementation&#13;
capacity. Specifically, it will finance the recruitment of a local consultant as the education project officer&#13;
to assist the Director of Planninginthe generalmanagementof EMRPeducation component. Itwill also&#13;
finance a consultancy to assess training needs for primary school teachers and school principals, and&#13;
develop atraining plan to address them.&#13;
&#13;
Phase I Project Activity 3: Itwill also finance the studies for the preparation of the Phase 2, including (a)&#13;
consultant for the preparation ofbidding documents for textbooks and teacher guides, andprocurement of&#13;
other didactic materials, and (b) engineering studies to design andprepare tender documents for primary&#13;
school construction,&#13;
&#13;
Phase 2 (total cost US$30million, anticipatedto be implementedbetween January 1,2006and&#13;
December 31,2009)&#13;
&#13;
The secondphase estimated at some US$34.5 million will finance all activities to increase accessto&#13;
primary education and a large proportionof activities aimed at buildinginstitutional capacity. Duringthe&#13;
secondphase, activitieswill support the construction (including supervision) and hrnishingabout 690&#13;
newclassrooms (accommodating 55,000 students). Many o fthe schools will be builtwhere no&#13;
functioning school currently exists. Phase 2 will contribute financing related infrastructure, such as&#13;
teachers' houses, latrines, water and sanitation facilities, and an administrative office. The new schools&#13;
are expectedto operate intwo shifts with a capacity of 40 students per classroom, per shift. Finally,&#13;
activitieswill help to (a) provide training intended to strengthen school administration, managementand&#13;
leadership of school directors; (b) improve data collection, analysis and planningpayingparticular&#13;
attention to enhancing the management information systemusedto track teachers, student flows, and&#13;
resources; (c) support selectedstudiesto assess the quality and usefulness of financed interventions, and&#13;
(d) support central andprovincial directorates for implementationof activities. Table 4 presentsthe cost&#13;

Classroom construction. Construction of about 690 new classrooms (equivalent to 55,162 spaces) which&#13;
would implyeither opening new schools where none existedbefore or extremely dilapidated andnon-&#13;
functioning sites. It i s envisagedthat rural schoolswill have either three or six classrooms, while those&#13;
located inor close to the municipal capital will have between six and 12classrooms. The school&#13;
construction programwill include relatedamenities suchas latrines, water and sanitation facilities, and an&#13;
administrative office. The new schools are expectedto operate intwo shifts witha capacity of 40&#13;
students per classroom, per shift.&#13;
&#13;
Construction of teachers'houses: The programwill provide a teacher's house for every new schools in&#13;
rural areas to facilitate rapid deployment of school directors to ensure quality teaching begins promptly.&#13;
&#13;
Procuring schoolfurniture. The programwill provide school furniture for all the new classrooms (school&#13;

Strengthening school level administration and management. The programwill support capacity building&#13;
activities to strengthen school administration, managementand leadershipamong school directors.&#13;
&#13;
Improving data collection, analysis andplanning. Support willbe givento capacity building activities at&#13;
central, provincial and local levelto improve the management and administration of the system.&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the enhancementof the Management Information Systemon teachers,&#13;
student flows andresource management.&#13;
&#13;
Providing basic ofice equipment. Assistancewill be provided to enable minimumconditions at central&#13;
andprovincial levels to collect and manage information. Computers andoffice equipment will be&#13;
providedat the central and provincial levels.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and evaluatingthe interventions. Support will be providedto conduct selectedstudies to&#13;
assess the quality and usefulnessof interventions supportedunder the emergencyprogram.&#13;
&#13;
Coordinating the activities in support of education. Support will beprovided for central and provincial&#13;
directorates to ensure adequate programimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 2Activity 3: Engineeringservicesfor the supervision of worksfor the classrooms constructions&#13;
and additional works envisaged.&#13;
&#13;
Implementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
The PMIUinthe Ministryof Planningwill beresponsible for procurement and financial managementof&#13;
the overallproject. The Ministryo f Education will ingeneral handle all other aspects ofthe project,&#13;
including preparingthe terms o f reference for the consultancies and biddingdocuments for the works, and&#13;
beresponsible for executing thempreparing the projectmonitoring reports. The role ofresponsibilities of&#13;
the PMIUinrelation to the line ministries and other government entities involved with the project will be&#13;
specified ina memorandum o f understanding signed by the parties to the agreement.&#13;
&#13;
The Director of Planninginthe Ministryof Education will be the focal person for the education&#13;
component. The relevant departmentsof education--the Department of Studies and Planning, the&#13;
Department of School Infrastructure, the National Institute o f EducationDevelopment and Research, and&#13;
the Department of Teacher Training, and the provincial and municipal education officers-will be&#13;
responsible for implementing the various activities.&#13;
&#13;
Due to weak capacity within education and the expectedlarge volume of work under the project, a full-&#13;
time education project officer will berecruitedto support the Director ofPlanning. Further,short-term&#13;
consultants will be hired to assist with specific areas o f implementationincluding (a) finalization of&#13;
school design andpreparation o f biddingdocuments for primary school construction, and (b)preparation&#13;
of specifications for procurement o f textbooks and other didactic materials andpreparation of bidding&#13;
documents, The provincial Director o f Education and Culture will beresponsible for coordinating site&#13;
selection, and for synchronizing the PMlU's procurement plans with those of the provincial directorate to&#13;
ensure smooth distribution of materials and deployment ofteachers.&#13;
&#13;
Civil works during Phase 2. Constructionandrehabilitation o f classrooms and sanitary facilities, and&#13;
procurement of furniture will be carriedout through separate contracts, due to the large number of&#13;
classrooms required. Constructiono f classrooms, administrativeoffice, teachers' houses, and latrines&#13;
(VIP type), andprovision of water (boreholes) will bepart ofthe same contract. School constructionwill&#13;
be procured predominantly through ICB. This methodi s expected to expedite construction and to help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    74&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reduce unitprices. About 115 schools will be constructedaltogether inthe five provinces covered by the&#13;
program. Eachprovince will offer one tender comprising 1to 3 lots, giving a total of 5 tenders. Eachlot&#13;
will comprise 11to 16 schools. To encouragea goodresponsefrom enterprises, andto ensure that&#13;
procurement i s administrativelyfeasible for the PMIUand Ministryof Education, tenders will be&#13;
launched inthree phasesat six-month intervals. Dependingon final selection of school sites, the current&#13;
distributiono f schools by province would make itpossible to phase the construction by the ratio of&#13;
40:40:20 ina twelve-month period.&#13;
&#13;
Works supervision will be carried out by architectural or engineering consulting firms. The firm will be&#13;
responsible for the design work, site adjustment, preparation o fbiddocuments, and to supervision&#13;
(fiscalizacao). The PMIUwill processthe procurement while Ministry of Education's Department of&#13;
Infrastructure within its bureau ofplanning and statistics and the provincialDirectorate of Education will&#13;
monitor progress with contract managementon behalfof the beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
School water supply. The programwill provide potable water to all school being constructed. This&#13;
would be ina form o f boreholes or protectedshallow wells with hand-pumps. The execution of this work&#13;
will beincludedinthe construction contract. Inadditionto site investigation anddrilling, the contractors&#13;
will berequiredto train school communities inthe proper use andmaintenanceofthe equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Schoolfurniture. Desks, teachers' tables, and chairs will be procured through ICB. Five tenders will be&#13;
preparedinline with the tenderingfor school construction. Iti s expectedthat atotal of 13,790 desks will&#13;
have to beprocuredand distributedinproportionto schoolsineachprovince. Eachtender will be for&#13;
desks equal to the requirements o f one province. These will be tenderedinthree phasesbeginning six&#13;
months after the initial tender for school construction. The same ratio of 40:40:20 would be followed.&#13;
Eachtender will have a number of desks equal to the number o f lots as per the school construction&#13;
schedule. This meansthat lots will contain between 1,320 and 1,920 desks. Firmswill be allowedto&#13;
tender for as many lots as they may possiblybid for.&#13;
&#13;
School materials (learning and teachina). School materials have already beenprepared and the credit&#13;
will finance only reprintingand distribution. The Ministryo f Education owns the copyright o fthe&#13;
materials inquestion. Giventhe economieso f scale associatedwith printing, it would be advisable that&#13;
same firmbe awarded the contract for printingthe same types ofmaterial (book). Materials will be&#13;
deliveredintwo batches, oneper year, duringthe first two years ofthe project. The Ministryo f&#13;
Educationinconjunction with the provincial Directorate of Educationwill prepare the technical&#13;
specifications and schedule of delivery of materials. Iftenders include delivery to the school, then&#13;
allowing for firms to bidfor more than one lot would be advantageous interms o f delivery. Firmswill be&#13;
invitedto bidfor to printone or moremanuals invarious quantities for grades 1to 6; and inaddition to&#13;
printteachers' educational materials. The PMIUwillprepare suchtendersto includedelivery to schools.&#13;
&#13;
Didactic materials. Once the school kits are definedand quantities per class determined, procurement&#13;
and distribution willbe handledthroughthe UNICEF system.&#13;
&#13;
Computers and ofice equipment. Given the numbersrequired, it would be prudent that these be&#13;
purchasedjointly with the central procurement (PMIU of other similar equipment inthe project. The&#13;
MinistryofEducation andthe provincialDirectorateofEducationwill preparethe technical&#13;
specifications and agree on quantities required at eachlevel.&#13;
&#13;
Teacher recruitment and training. Remuneration of 1,379 new teachers will needto be includedinthe&#13;
budget duringthe three-years of Phase 1(equivalent to about US4.8 million for the period inreference).&#13;
Theprovincial directorates would publicizethe list ofvacancies andit is expectedthat there wouldbe&#13;
sufficient number of teachersresponding to the demand, due to the recent significant increaseinteacher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   75&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
salaries(from US$60-US$70 to US$135 per monthas of October 2002). Hiredteachers would receive&#13;
three months of training before startingclasses, through the training programmodel supportedby&#13;
UNICEF.&#13;
&#13;
Training of teachers, schoolprincipals, and of staffresponsible for education statistics. Teacher training&#13;
will beprovided throughan international firmthat will providetraining to all teachers under the program.&#13;
Requests for proposals will be preparedfor this service. Training of school principals and staff&#13;
responsible for education statistics will be organized internally at the ministerial level through short&#13;
courses and seminars at headquartersand at provincial level. Iti s expectedthat training sessions will take&#13;
place inprovincial capitals where school principalsor municipalandprovincial staffwill gather.&#13;
Arrangements will needto be madeby the PMIUto transfer financialresourcesto theprovincial&#13;
directorates for payment of daily subsistenceallowances and transport costs to principals and municipal&#13;
and provincial staff.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring o fprogramactivities would be carried out at all levels. The Ministryof Education at the&#13;
central level, with provincial and municipal authorities will develop a simple form to carry out monitoring&#13;
of the program. Municipal education staff will visit schools periodically (at least once per quarter) to&#13;
monitor the status of construction, presenceof teachers, and availability o f didactic materials. Provincial&#13;
staff will visit schools, on a randombasis, for the same purpose and to resolve issues that arise, and&#13;
central level staffwill visit eachprovincetwice a year to monitor the status of the programand&#13;
recommend improvements inprocessesandprocedures. The PMIUwill arrangeto transfer financial&#13;
resources to the various levels to cover costs of transportation and daily subsistenceallowances.&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe projectimplementationperiod, studies wouldbe carried out bythe Ministryof Educationto&#13;
ensurethat quantitative and qualitativetargets are met, including a study on use of didactic materials in&#13;
the classroom, and/or applicationof learned knowledge and methodologies during training couldbe&#13;
conducted. Studies will be carriedout not earlier than the secondyear of project implementation. Terms&#13;
of reference would bepreparedby specialists contracted for that purpose.&#13;

                    Appendix5: Decentralizationand Supportto LocalDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
Angola i s an enormous country with aprofoundethnic, socioeconomic, cultural, andlinguistic diversity.&#13;
Angola i s still a centralized State vertically organized. There i s a needto set up an institutional&#13;
governance framework to respond to that heterogeneity. Policiesandnationalstrategies:&#13;
Decentralization is a central issue inthe public and institutional agenda inAngola as shown inmany&#13;
publicpolicies andnationalstrategies.&#13;
&#13;
Policies and nationalstrategies&#13;
&#13;
Decentralization has been at the central theme in the public and institutional agenda in Angola as have&#13;
been shown by manypublic policies andnationalstrategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Publicpoliciedlegalframework. The processhas gained enthusiasmsince 2001 with the&#13;
        approval ofthe fundamental principles for the future Constitutionof Angola. The Local&#13;
       Administration Act (Decree Law 17/99) assigns more functions to the municipaland communal&#13;
        administration, as well as creating aninclusive andparticipatory consultative organ made up of&#13;
        eachtiers of the local Government.&#13;
&#13;
        In1999, the Government ofAngola putinplace anintergovernmental transfer systemthat guides&#13;
       the allocationoffinds from the centralto theprovincial Government, which on itsturnhaveto&#13;
        distributethe funds to the municipalities(Executive Decree 80/99). The Executive Decreehas&#13;
       never been fully implemented. The financial resourcesare always transferred with delays to the&#13;
        subnationalgovernment affectingtheir planningandimplementationexercise.&#13;
&#13;
       According to the ProvincialProgramme for the Improvementof Basic Social Services (PPIBSS),&#13;
       the Council of Ministers, inaddition to the funds included inthe public investment program&#13;
        (PIP), allocated US$20millionto eachprovince for arapid upscaling ofbasic social services&#13;
        delivery to the population, such as health, education, water andelectricity su ply, basic&#13;
        sanitation, roads and the recovery of the private sector (Resolug5o 16/02, 19 July). The&#13;
                                                                                         P&#13;
        addendum contribution was allocated without any objective criteria such as density population,&#13;
        development indicators andrevenue performance. Despite satisfactory disbursement,provincial&#13;
        governments failed inthe presentation of monthly financial and executing report.&#13;
&#13;
       Nationalstrategies. At the end of 2001, the Council o fMinisters approved a Strategic Planthat&#13;
       puts forward a comprehensive vision and strategy for de-concentration anddecentralization&#13;
       reforms, which foresees a deeper fiscal deconcentration and a tentative fiscal decentralization.&#13;
       This requires the establishment o f anew mechanismo f intergovernmental fiscaltransfer andan&#13;
       improvedrole ofthe municipalities inthe collecting o f taxes. Furthermore, a UNDP study on&#13;
       decentralization realizedon 2003 recommends such local fiscal policy. The government&#13;
       approved the recommendations made bythe study. Besides the "regulation ofjkanqas locais" i s&#13;
       considered one o f the main area of intervention o fthe September ECPPRSP as well as of the&#13;
       National Long-Term Development Strategy and the Medium-Term Development Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The existing legal and institutional framework andpolicy enable experimentation of&#13;
       deconcentration and decentralization as fiscal decentralization with a gradual strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The main objective of the first phaseproject i s to carry out a feasibility study meantto: i)diagnose the&#13;
needs, constraints, risk-assumptions to be overcome, ii)define the nature, mechanismand modality of&#13;
fiscal transfer from the State Budgetto the targetedmunicipalities, iii)define the strategy, management,&#13;
disbursingandreportingarrangements,policy objectives, possible impactandreplicationas well as an&#13;
exit strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Italso intends, throughthe implementation ofthe study, to: i)define andapprove the institutionaland&#13;
legal framework, implementation arrangements,ii)provide technical assistance, iii)buildcapacity at&#13;
provincial and municipal level to plan, budget, implementand monitor economic and social small-scale&#13;
rural infrastructure, iv) find out the mechanisms for investment programming, budgeting, implementation,&#13;
assets management, accounting, v) create amechanism and practical tools for regular auditing,&#13;
monitoringand financial reportingrequirements, vi) start up the pilot fiscal transfer, vii) purchaserelevant&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
The main objective of the foreseen secondphase i s to pilot a mechanism of fiscal transfer from the central&#13;
Government to the targeted municipalities. Italso intendsenable to (a) define anholistic approachto the&#13;
implementationof decentralizationreforms; (b) establish a model for financing the sub national&#13;
administrations' development budget; (c); increasecapacity at provincial and municipal levels to plan,&#13;
budget, and implementandmonitor economic and social small-scalerural infrastructure; (d) provide&#13;
technical assistance. The transfers, administered by the Ministryof Finance, would enablemunicipalities&#13;
to articulate their own local development policies and invest inlocal infrastructures, urban development,&#13;
and services delivery, protectionof the environment and promotionof local economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Geographic focus area&#13;
&#13;
The sub component will be carried out inthe following municipalities: Kilamba Kiaxi (Luanda&#13;
province), Kamacupa (BiC province), Calandula (Malange province), and Sanza Pombo (Uige province).&#13;
The target provinces/municipalities were selectedon the follo.wingcriteria: (a) target provinces selected&#13;
bythe government to benefit from the EMRP, (b) most war affectedversuslesswar affected provinces&#13;
andmunicipalities; (c), most populated versus less populated municipalities; (d) rural versus urban&#13;
municipalities, (e) interior versus coastalprovinces; (0 existing of a local development partnership&#13;

&#13;
Activities&#13;
&#13;
Phase 1(theproject)&#13;
&#13;
Activity 1:MunicipalJinancingfor recovely, rehabilitation and local development. This refers to the&#13;
define, throughthe feasibility study, the nature of the fiscal transfer (for example, the municipal&#13;
development fund) to finance municipal budgets rather than predefined projects to set up eligibility&#13;
criteria for the allocationo f the fund; to the set up a mechanism for fiscal transfers to finance municipal&#13;
budgetsrather than predefined projects; andprovidingmunicipalities with aminimumofregular and&#13;
locally predictable and programmable resources (for bothrecurrent and capital spending inproportions&#13;
that could be earmarkedifnecessary) for development spending.&#13;
&#13;
Activity 2: Municipal planning and budgeting. This refers to (a) the definition of technical procedures&#13;
and mechanisms for the local public expenditures, suchplanning, management, investment programming,&#13;
annual budgeting, implementation, reporting and accounting; (b) training of local officers inthe&#13;
managementof the fiscal transfer; (c) conduct arevenue generation feasibility study to investigate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     78&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
opportunities for municipalities to generate as well as mobilize income; (d) draft, adoption and&#13;
dissemination of the managementand operational proceduresfor disbursement, including the eligibility&#13;
and performance criteria for access to the fiscal transfer (for example, the municipaldevelopment fund).&#13;
&#13;
Activity 3: Statesupport and supervision of the municipal sector. This refers to strengththe capacity of&#13;
the both central and local government to support, supervise andmonitor the managemento fthe&#13;
transferred funds. A first pilot fiscal transfer (about US$1million) to four selectedmunicipalitieswill be&#13;
executedto test the mechanismand proceduresand carefully monitoredto review the operational&#13;
proceduresproposed.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 2&#13;
&#13;
Activity I:Municipalfinancingfor recovery, rehabilitation, and local development. Thisrefers to the a&#13;
core pilot fiscal transfer (for example, the municipal development fund) to finance municipalbudgets&#13;
rather than pre-defined projects; provide municipalitieswith aminimumof regular and locally predictable&#13;
and programmable resources(for bothrecurrent and capital spendinginproportions that couldbe&#13;
earmarkedifnecessary) for development spending.&#13;
&#13;
Activity 2: Municipal planning and budgeting. This refers to (a) increase capacity buildingofthe&#13;
municipal administration to plan, budget, implement, manage and monitor the deliveryof sustainable&#13;
public services; (b) refine of the fiscal decentralization mechanisms, (c) evaluate the fiscal transfer&#13;
mechanisminview of their institutionalizationwithinthe national finance managementand monitoring&#13;
system and design ofa strategy for the replication; (d) establish ofaprovincial government fiscal data&#13;
bank to the municipalities (e) develop o f an improvedprocedures for municipal level strategic planning,&#13;
budgeting,implementation, accounting, monitoring andevaluation, (0facilitatemunicipalities to carry&#13;
out participatorymulti-year investment programmingand annual budgetingexercise; (g) assist&#13;
municipalities inthe implementationof selectedactions.&#13;
&#13;
Activity 3: Statesupport and supervision of the municipal sector. This refers to strengthening the&#13;
capacity of (a) provincial government to providetechnical assistance and supervision to municipalitiesas&#13;
well as managenecessaryand appropriate procedural controls for the transferred funds; and (b)the&#13;
central government to ensure it can perform its overall regulatoryand monitoring role.&#13;
&#13;
Synergies. The subcomponent will develop close links and harmonize its activitieswith anumber of&#13;
relatednationalprogrammes inthe area o fpoverty reduction, rural development andpublic sector&#13;
capacity building, municipal planning implementedby the government, UNand cooperation agenciesand&#13;
variety ofNGOs civil society organizations (intemational andnational). These include programs that&#13;
follow similar methodologies to the municipal development fund, such as the European Union Support&#13;
Reconstruction Program, and the Social Action Fund. Inparticular the first phaserelies onthe&#13;
participatorydynamism put inplace inthe targeted municipalities by the above mentionedprojects with&#13;
the aimto use this budget aid on a driven prioritybase. Inaddition, the project will influence broader&#13;
policy and legislative development at national level, particularly with respect to budgetreform and&#13;
changes inthe current system o f intergovemmentalfiscal transfer, as well as with the bothcomponent A&#13;
and component Bof the EMRF'.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional arrangements. The UNDPwill draft the terms o freference for the feasibility study and share&#13;
themwiththe government andthe major stakeholdersinterveninginthe decentralization area. The follow&#13;
upofthe first phasewillbe ensuredbya steering committee comprisingUNDP, MinistryofFinance,&#13;
MinistryofTerritorial Administration, targeted provinces andmunicipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The pilot fiscal transfers during Phase 1projectandthen Phase2 willbemanagedbythe targeted&#13;
municipal administrations supportedbythe project technical assistance, inclosecollaboration with the&#13;
community inwhich concems the identificationof municipal priorities. The municipal administration&#13;
will act under the supervision ofthe provincial departmentof the MinistryofFinance. The latter andthe&#13;
provincialbureau o f studies, planning, and statisticswill assist the municipalitiesinthe implementation of&#13;
the fund.&#13;
&#13;
The supervision is the duty ofthe directors ofprovincial departmentofthe MinistryofFinance andthe&#13;
provincial bureau o f studies, planning, and statistics. A provincial supervisor committee will be&#13;
established to ensure effective coordination. This committee will comprise representativesofkey&#13;
provincial directorates involvedinthe activities of the project at local level andthe administrator o f&#13;
targeted municipalities. The project will be accountableto the govemment, especially through the&#13;
MinistryofFinancenationaldirector for budgetandaccounting.&#13;
&#13;
Basedon its prior field experienceindecentralization, UNDP will assistthe govemment (Ministryof&#13;
Territorial Administration) and selectedprovincial governments and municipalitiesinthe implementation&#13;
of this component. The UNCDFwill beresponsible for technical backstopping and monitoringof the&#13;
implementationo fthe municipal development fundthrough periodic technical review missions, provision&#13;
of technical inputs, activities to measurepolicy impact andpotentialfor replication, and fielding the&#13;
midtermand final evaluation missions. A memorandum of understanding will guide this partnership.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring indicators. Inorder to monitor the impact o fthe pilot, measurableandtangible indicators&#13;
will be established. These may include (a) percentageofmunicipalities with access to sustainable&#13;
resources of funds for local development plans after project support ends; (b) access to economic and&#13;
social infrastructure by percentageinthe targeted municipalities; (c) degree to which project i s replicated&#13;
inother municipalities; (d) numberofmunicipalitieswithsustainableplanningsystems andprocessesin&#13;
place; (e) number o fplans produced withinbudget and on time; (f) number of local staff technically&#13;
trained inplanning, budgeting, monitoring, accounting and audit.&#13;

Objectives of the M&amp;E System&#13;
&#13;
An effective M&amp;Esystemwillbeput inplace as ameans of assessingthe progressand impact ofthe&#13;
EMRP, as well as generating informationandlessonsto informandguide the future programto&#13;
rehabilitate and develop the various urban andrural water supply systems. The M&amp;Esystemwill be&#13;
sufficiently comprehensive to meet the requirementsofthe different stakeholders, while at the same time&#13;
beingrelatively simple to implementgiventhe capacity constraints faced inthe field.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, theM&amp;E systemfor the water supplycomponentofthe EMRPprojectwill havethe&#13;
following specific objectives:&#13;
         0   To provide the GOAand the World Bank with regular monitoring informationregarding&#13;
             project performance andprogress, thus enabling themto account for funduse andto take&#13;
             corrective actionwhen necessary.&#13;
         0   To provideproject managementand support teams at the nationaland provincial levels with&#13;
             timely and accurate information to assist inthe ongoing management, planning and&#13;
             review o fthe component.&#13;
         0   To track progress againstKey Performance Indicators as defined inthe project logical&#13;
             framework.&#13;
             To specify a community-based monitoring systemthat provides key informationfor the&#13;
             exercise of community oversight ofproposed activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Typesof Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
performance monitoring and evaluation will assess the extent to which project activities are achieving&#13;
their statedoutputs, outcomes andresults, as abasis for an effective ongoingprocess ofimplementation,&#13;
supervision and review. This will require that effective systems and procedures are put inplace to&#13;
document, measureand evaluate progress; to take corrective actionwhennecessary; to disseminate&#13;
information, lessons and best practice to all key stakeholders; and to solicit feedback fromproject partners&#13;
and beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
Two kindsof datawill beroutinely collected and presentedfor each component:&#13;
         1) Progress(Activity) Reporting&#13;
         2) Results (Output) Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Results Monitoring Reports will be produced semi-annually and will track outputs against targets defined&#13;
for eachKeyPerformance Indicator (KPI) and for eacho f the provinces inwhich the project i s financing&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;

this information.&#13;
&#13;
Mechanisms and instruments will also be put inplace to validate the accuracy andreliability of the&#13;
information providedinthe various ResultsMonitoringReports. These will take anumber of forms,&#13;
including:&#13;
  0      Regular field visits and spot-check visits to the provinces by the designatedM&amp;Eofficial from&#13;
         MINEAand other project staff from DNA.&#13;
  0      Community and beneficiary surveys (to be conducted as part ofthe qualitative monitoring&#13;
         program)&#13;
  0      Specially commissioned external assessments, where there i s a particular cause for concern about&#13;
         the reliability of the information andreporting systems.&#13;

B.       ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
A procurement plan for project implementation was preparedduring appraisal, which will govern the&#13;
choice of the procurement methods usedfor all the contracts. It covers the project that would be financed&#13;
from the IDA 13 allocation.     This planhasbeen agreedonbetweenthe Borrower andthe Project Team&#13;
at negotiations. It i s attachedto this report as Appendix 13. The approved procurement planwill be&#13;
posted on the Bank's public website after the credit has been approved by the Board. Furthermore, the&#13;
award results for the procurement of individual contracts will be publicly disclosed according the&#13;
proceduresprescribedby the Bank. The procurementplanwill be updatedannually, or sooner as&#13;
required, to reflect the project implementationneeds and improvements inthe institutionalcapacity. Any&#13;
proposed revisions to the agreedprocurement planwill be submittedto the Bank for its prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
For the project, the aggregate value of goods and works contracts subject to prior review isUS$41.4&#13;
million and that of consultants services i s US$12.7 million (see Appendix 13).&#13;

Institutional Arrangements for Procurement&#13;
&#13;
A Project Management and ImplementationUnit (PMIU), will be established inthe MinistryofPlanning&#13;
and will managethe procurement and implementationactivities of the whole multi-sector project. Itwill&#13;
work inclose collaborationwith the sector ministries and agencies that are participatinginthe project, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     91&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
retains the ultimate responsibility for procurement and contract management for the Borrower. The main&#13;
procurement functions o fthe PMIUare to (a) coordinate the preparation and updating o f the procurement&#13;
plans ina timely manner and submit them to the Bank for review; (b) monitor the preparations o f the&#13;
technical aspects o fprocurement (terms o f reference, bills o f quantities, technical specifications, andthe&#13;
like) by the participatingministries and agencies and assist them inthe preparation as necessary; (c) cany&#13;
out the procurement according to the Bank's Guidelines and the provisions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement; and (d) monitor the procurement processes and the management o f the contracts by the&#13;
participatingministriesand agencies and assist them with contract management as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
The participatingministries and agencies will be responsible for preparing the initial requirements for&#13;
procurement, including the terms o freference, bills o fquantities, specifications, and the like, and&#13;
providing them to PMIU. The PMIUwill conduct the procurement process up to the award o f contract.&#13;
The ministries andagencies will participate inthe preparation o f short lists and the evaluation o fbids and&#13;
proposals under the direction o fPMIU. The contracts will be signedby the ministers or heads o f agencies&#13;
concerned, who will then be responsible for the management o f the contracts. The PMIUwill monitor&#13;
contract management and assist the ministriesand agencies inthis task as needed. Payments for contracts&#13;
will be madebythe PMIUagainst certificationreceived from the ministry/agency responsible for the&#13;
particular contract.&#13;
&#13;
The PMIUwill contain a procurement section, headed by an internationally recruited chief procurement&#13;
officer ad staffed with at least 2 procurement officers, recruitednationally. Ithas been agreed that until&#13;
the procurement group of PMIUi s adequately staffed, the project implementation unito f Economic&#13;
Management Technical Assistance project, which i s also located inthe Ministryo f Planning, will perform&#13;
the essentialprocurement functions.&#13;
&#13;
An assessmento fthe procurement capacity o fthe Ministryo fPlanningandthe ministriesandagencies&#13;
participating inthis project was carried out by a procurement specialist o fthe Bank duringpreappraisal in&#13;
M a y 2004. The specialist reviewed the organizational structure for implementingthe project and the&#13;
availability inthe country o fprocurement specialists for Bank-assistedproject implementation. The&#13;
assessmentrevealed a severe scarcity o f qualified specialists locally and a dearth o f experience with&#13;
procurement according to accepted principles o f international procurement. These findings corroborate&#13;
those o f the CPAR o f 2002.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement RiskAssessment and RiskMitigation&#13;
&#13;
The CPAR o f 2002 covered a wide range o fprocurement aspects, including (a) the degree to which the&#13;
government promotes a culture o f accountability; (b) the status o fprocurement staff, including salary&#13;
structure and capabilities; (c) the degree to which procurement i s free from political interference; (d) the&#13;
existence o f clearly written standards andprocedures; and (e) the degree o f efficiency, transparency and&#13;
value-for-money. Ineach o f these areas, the CPAR found that the Angolan procurement system needs&#13;
major improvements, and, consequently, i s considered a highrisk. The brief assessmentscarriedout&#13;
duringpreappraisal and appraisal found that very little hadchangedsince the publicationo fthe reportin&#13;
this regard.&#13;
&#13;
Three major problems were identified: transparency, enforcement, and lack o f capacity. Specifically:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   Weaknessesof the legalframework and lack of enforcement. While there are laws pertaining&#13;
      to public procurement matters that are written but not adequately publicized or enforced (Decrees no&#13;
       7/96 and 22-A/92 regulate the mainprocurement aspects), some procurement practices have no&#13;
      legal basis but are vigorously enforced. Even when they are familiar with its rules, civil servants&#13;
       seem to ignoreprocurement law without beingpenalized, and enforcing o f the law is erratic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    92&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Procurement regulations are not enforcedbecause control mechanisms, either intemal (within&#13;
     procurement entities) or external are missingat all levels. Inaddition, none o f the state-owned&#13;
     enterprises visited duringthe CPAR had written internal procurement rules, describing methods and&#13;
     levels o f authorization for spendingpublic funds. The government Gazette does not seemto&#13;
     contribute to transparency and to the dissemination o f regulations, as it i s relatively expensive and&#13;
     apparently not widely distributed within the government itself.&#13;
&#13;
     Inefficientand costlyprocedures and practices. The Angolan government acquires goods,&#13;
     works and services, butnot ina consistent manner or according to rules generally recognized as&#13;
     binding. A number o fprocurement procedures andpractices are neither economic nor efficient,&#13;
     and are not incompliance withrecommendedprocurement best practices. Although nearly all&#13;
     goods are imported, most o f them are procured through local suppliers. The two areas where&#13;
     practices need to be changed inorder to enhance fairness and transparency inthe procurement&#13;
     process are (a) adoption o f open competitive biddingas the primary method o fprocurement, and&#13;
     (b)establishmento fa transparent procurement system. There is currentlynoeffective mechanism&#13;
     to lodge complaints inrelationto the biddingprocess. The lack o f oversight, transparency, and&#13;
     audit, has created many opportunities for corruption.&#13;
&#13;
     Weak procurementorganizationand capacity, There is a lack o fprocurement capacity at all&#13;
     levels, bothinLuanda and inthe provinces, includingpoor record keepinginthe ministries. This&#13;
     deficit incapacity i s due to (a) very little importance given to public procurement ingeneral; and&#13;
     (b) lack o fadequatelytrained personnel inthe full range o factivities linked to procurement&#13;
     functions.&#13;
&#13;
     Weak audit and anti-corruptionmechanisms. There is no oversight mechanismto ensure&#13;
     regular application o f procurement regulations and no procurement audits. Procurement regulations&#13;
     are not enforced because intemal control mechanisms inthe procurement entities are lackingat all&#13;
     levels, as is the case for external mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
     Paymentdelays result inhigher award prices. Iti s a commonpractice for government ministries&#13;
     and other agencies to delay payments by more than 90 days to suppliers and contractors, while the&#13;
     internationally acceptedpractice is 30 to 45 days. Most payment delays are due to poor planning,&#13;
     especially inrelation to the budgetingprocess and the actual funding available to pay against&#13;
     commitments. Although allowed by existingregulations, price adjustment clauses are not used, and&#13;
     the risko f inflation and the effects o f devaluation o f the local currency are passed on to suppliers&#13;
     and contractors. The expectation o f slow payment has two damaging consequences. It imposes on&#13;
     the government's contract partners the burdento pre-finance contract payments for several months&#13;
     and therefore discourages participation o f qualified businesses with limited liquidfunds,&#13;
     particularly newly establishedAngolan businesses, and it encourages bidders to factor the cost o f&#13;
     late payments into their bids, resulting inhigher thannecessary award prices. Highconstruction&#13;
     prices inAngola may be explained, inpart, by very slow payments.&#13;
&#13;
The review o f the capacity of individual entities involved inthe implementationo f the Economic&#13;
Management Technical Assistance project confirmed the above general observations. However, it was&#13;
notedthat where large value contracts were handled, the ministry/agency hadresorted to the use o f&#13;
external consultants to conduct the mainprocurement activities on its behalf. Consequently, there i s no&#13;
adequate intemally retainedcapacity even insuch ministriedagencies to conduct procurement on their&#13;
Own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     93&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Inconsideration ofthe presentprocurement situation andthe needfor arapidimplementation ofthe&#13;
emergency project, it was agreedthat all the procurement for the project will be carried out centrally in&#13;
the Ministryof Planning. Other measuresthat will be taken to minimize the risks ofprocurement&#13;
problems to occur are (a) provision of training inprocurement to all local staff involved inthe project, (b)&#13;
preparation of aprocurement planwith the participationof all the relevant ministriedagencies; (c)&#13;
creation of a monitoring and filing systemfor procurement actions by the PMIU; (d) setting up of an&#13;
procurement section inthe PMIU, staffed with international andnationalprocurement experts, (e) the&#13;
large majority of contracts to be subject to prior review by Bank, particularly inthe first year, (0&#13;
preparation and use of appropriate procurement and other manuals, and (g) carryingout ofregular&#13;
procurement audits.&#13;
&#13;
The implementationofthe agreedaction planthat resulted fromthe CPARis includedinEconomic&#13;
Management Technical Assistanceproject. The procurement of the consulting services for these&#13;
measureshas however only reachedthe terms-of-reference preparation stage. Various complementary&#13;
forms o fprocurement training would beprovidedthrough EMW to increasethe procurement capacity in&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
The overall project risk for procurement is high.&#13;
&#13;
D. FreauencvofProcurementSuDervision&#13;
&#13;
The frequency ofprocurement supervision i s proposed to be once every 4 months inthe first year and&#13;
once every 6 months insubsequentyears. Every supervision mission should include apost-review of&#13;
procurement decisions.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The objective ofthe FinancialManagement Assessment is to determinewhether the entities implementing&#13;
the Phase 1Emergency Multisector Recovery Project have acceptable financial management&#13;
arrangementsinplace. The arrangementsincludethe entities' systems of accounting, reporting, auditing&#13;
and internal controls. The entities' arrangementsare acceptableifthey are considered capable of&#13;
recordingcorrectly all transactionsand balances, supporting the preparation ofregular andreliable&#13;
financial statements, safeguardingthe entities' assets, and are subjectto auditingarrangements acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The assessmentwas conducted at the MinistryofPlanning. Assessment questionnaireswere completed&#13;
bythe Ministry ofPlanning. Thisreport is a record ofthe results ofthe assessment oftheproposed&#13;
financial managementarrangements for the EMW implementedbythe Project Management and&#13;
ImplementationUnit(PMIU) under the Ministry of Planning(MOP).&#13;

&#13;
The conclusion of the assessment is that the country risk i s high. However, the overall financial&#13;
managementriskfor the project i s considered moderate subject to the implementationofriskmitigation&#13;
measuresidentified inthe table below; and the conditions and datedcovenantspresentedinthe financial&#13;
management action plan. Withthe implementationof the action plan, the project will be capable of&#13;
having an adequate financial managementsystems andhandling the financial managementand&#13;
disbursement ofthe Credit.&#13;
&#13;
The Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) carried out by&#13;
IDAinMarch2004 incollaborationwiththe government indicatedthat there is notyet satisfactory&#13;
measureshave been taken to ensure transparency and good governanceof Bank-financedprojects. There&#13;
has not been any Bank diagnostic work on corruption inAngola. The existingo fmany off-budget&#13;
accounts, anot-yet fully implementedfinancial managementinformation system, inadequate systemsof&#13;
internal control and financial reporting ,and inadequateexternal auditing, might indeed cast serious&#13;
doubts about the transparency and good governance of financial managementofpublic resources. Under&#13;
these circumstances, a "ring fences" financial management strategy, with dedicated bank accounts, and&#13;
project financial managementmanualwill be established.&#13;
&#13;
Actions outlined inthe FinancialManagement Action Plan will be undertaken by the project to strengthen&#13;
the financial managementsystems. Three main actions are necessary: (a) appointment of an international&#13;
financial managementadvisor, an internal auditor, and a project accountant for the PMIU (three months&#13;
following effectiveness of the project); (b) adoption of a fully documented Financial Management Manual&#13;
which covers financial policies andprocedures, accounting and internal control system, financial&#13;
reporting, flow of funds and auditing arrangements(three months following effectiveness of the project);&#13;
and (c) installationof an integrated accounting software, including data testing (four months following&#13;
effectiveness ofthe project). ). Inaddition, the appointment of an external auditor under terms of&#13;
reference and experience satisfactory to the Bank (four months following project effectiveness) i s also&#13;
important. A Bank financial management specialist will undertake, duringthe first year ofproject&#13;
implementation, areview of PMIU capacity to ensure that it has adequate financial staff capable of&#13;
establishing the necessaryprocedures and internal controls over the use ofproject funds. The financial&#13;
management specialist will also familiarize the PMIUwith IDA'Sprocurement and disbursements&#13;
procedures,requirements of adequate accounting and submission of quarterly FMRs.The government&#13;
may retain for a short period the services of a specialized firmto install, within the PMIU, the financial&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
managementsystem, prepare the manual of proceduresand provide initialtraining to the staff of the&#13;
financial section of the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
Inorder to ensure that the projectiseffectivelyimplemented, the Government will ensure that appropriate&#13;
staffing arrangements aremaintained throughout the life of the project.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of the project&#13;
&#13;
The overall purpose ofthe EMRPis to helpto buildthe foundation for long-termo freconstruction,&#13;
economic rehabilitation, andthe reestablishment of state administration throughout the country. The&#13;
specific objectives o fthe project are to assist the government to (a) improve rural incomes and enhance&#13;
food security, especially inthe provinces most affectedby the conflict; (b) deliver essentialeducation and&#13;
health services, (c) restore critical transportation links, and (d) strengthen capacity of government at all&#13;
levels to formulate, prepare, implement, andmanagemediumand long-term development programs.&#13;
These objectives are consistentwith those of the ECP. They are also consistent with the priority phaseof&#13;
the government's multi-sector rehabilitationandreconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
The EMRPwill be implementedintwo phases. The Phase 1project ofUS$50.7 millionis fully funded&#13;
with support of IDA 13resources ofwhich US$24.9 million inthe form of a credit andUS$25.8 million&#13;
the form of a grant, and will be implemented over four years. The foreseensecondphase could amount&#13;
to some US$l50 million and could be funded under IDA 14, subject to timely and full availability of&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
Theproject will focus onsupporting activities that address the most urgent needsand canbeimplemented&#13;
quickly. These include (a) activities to restart agriculture (particularly production and multiplication of&#13;
seeds and planting material), (b) provision of drugs, logstical support, andrefresher courses for nurses&#13;
and auxiliary nurses to improve healthservices, (c) provision of teaching and learningmaterials and&#13;
assistance to initiate teachers' training, and (d) support to restore water services inLuanda and three&#13;
provincial capitals. Itwill also support (a) technical assistance for sector ministries and agencies involved&#13;
inimplementingtheproject, (b) initialtrainingprograms, and(c) technical assistance to buildlocal&#13;
capacity to prepare for decentralization, and (d) preparation of the environmental and social impact&#13;
assessmentfor the project and the social and environmental managementplan for Phase 1. Finally, it will&#13;
finance the management, monitoring and evaluation of the implementationof the project, support for&#13;
implementationo fthe national demining strategy and actionplan which are beingupdated, defining&#13;
actions critical for successful implementationof the project activities, andengineering studies (detailed&#13;
design, tender documents) and preparatory activities for an eventual Phase 2 investments.&#13;
&#13;
Program and Project components&#13;
&#13;
The proposedprogramcomprises four components: (a) rural development and delivery of social services;&#13;
(b) rehabilitationandreconstructionof critical infrastructure (roads andbridges, electricity, water supply,&#13;
and urban infrastructure); (c) capacity building, institutional strengthening and development of sector&#13;
strategies; and (d) managementand monitoring of the programandproject, and preparationo f the next&#13;
steps. The programhas been designed basedon free-standing subprojects that fit within the programbut&#13;
that are not integrally linked to other activities and that facilitate parallel financing arrangements. IDA'S&#13;
contribution, duringPhase 1, to these four components constitutes the IDA financed project.&#13;
&#13;
Country issues&#13;
&#13;
Recent developments seemto indicate that the authorities are now fully committedto enhance their&#13;
managementof the economy. The last few months have seen an intensification of the dialogue with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        96&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IMF, as well as a demonstration, onthepart ofthe authorities, of the increasing willingness to publicly&#13;
acknowledge the macroeconomic and transparencyissues that affect the country. Important inroads have&#13;
been made ingranting public accessto sensitive documentsand reports, and addressingthe issues of&#13;
quasi-fiscal and extra-budgetary spending inthe revisionof the 2003 budget. Nevertheless, focused&#13;
efforts on improvingpublic financial managementsystems and practices, as well as on strengtheningthe&#13;
"agencies ofrestraint" are still incipient. The PEMFARexercise follows-up on these questions. Yet, it&#13;
wouldnot undertake a full review of corruptionissues inthe country. This couldpotentially be the object&#13;
of an eventual Institutional and Govemance Review (IGR) inthe future.&#13;

Planning, assistedby the Project Administrator (a highlevel senior officer). The PMIUwill be assisted&#13;
bythe internationalconsultantsfor projectmonitoring, financial managementandprocurement. An&#13;
internal auditor, a financial manager (senior accountant), one or two accountant assistants will be&#13;
appointed to support the project implementation activities, as needed. Prior to staffing, adoption of an&#13;
acceptablefinancial managementsystem and manual ofproceduresby PMIUbeinginplace, interim&#13;
financial managementandprocurement support will bemade through the project unitof FAS 111,also in&#13;
MOP.&#13;
&#13;
Duringproject execution, PMIUestablishedbyMOP shall coordinate projectimplementation and&#13;
manage:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) procurement, includingpurchasesof goods, works, and consultingservices;&#13;
    (b) financial managementandrecordkeeping, accounts and disbursements;&#13;
    (c) project monitoring, reportingand evaluation;&#13;
    (d) contractual relationships with IDAand other donors.&#13;
&#13;
The accounting unitwill be computerized usingan accounting systemsoftware. A draft financial&#13;
managementmanual will be establishedby effectiveness of the project and it documents all the&#13;
accounting and internal control proceduresusedfor the project. The project's financial statementswill be&#13;
audited inaccordance with statutory requirements, and suitable terms ofreference.&#13;
&#13;
The PMIUwill ensure efficient coordinationamong differentagencies andministries that participate in&#13;
the project, including, butnot limited, to Apculture and Rural Development, Health, Education,&#13;
Transportation, Electricity, Water Supply, Urban Services. The PMIUwill also constitute the operational&#13;
linkto the IDAandother donorsonmattersrelatedtothe implementationoftheproject.&#13;
&#13;
Flow of funds&#13;
&#13;
Bank Accounts&#13;
&#13;
The following bank accountswill be maintained for the purposeso f implementingthe project:&#13;
&#13;
         0     Special Accounts: Denominated inUS dollars, disbursements from the IDA Credit will be&#13;
               deposited inSpecial Account A, disbursementsfrom the IDA Grant in Special Account B.&#13;
         0     PMIU Proiect Account: This will be denominated inlocal currency. Counterpart funds will&#13;
               be deposited onthis account inaccordancewith project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
These bank accounts shallbe openedat the Banco PoupancaCredit0 (BPC) by effectiveness date. Initial&#13;
 cashflow forecasts upon which the advance disbursement will be made from the IDACredit and Grant&#13;
 should also bepreparedby the same date. The authorized signatories will benominatedby the Minister&#13;
 of Planningand will be documented inthe Financial Management Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                     100&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Funds flow arrangements for the project(through the two bank accounts above) are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        0      IDAwill make an initial advance fromthe proceeds o fthe Creditbydepositing into a&#13;
               Borrower-operated Special Accounts held at the BPC (commercial bank) and denominated&#13;
               inUSDollars.&#13;
        0      Actual expenditures will be reimbursed through submission o f withdrawal applications and&#13;
               against summary sheet or statements o f expenditures which will be approved inaccordance&#13;
               with internal control measures applied inPMIU.&#13;
        0      While the activities are implemented inprovinces, the payments will be done centrally&#13;
               from the PMIUoffice inLuanda.&#13;
        0      Counterpart funds will be deposited inthe Project Account inaccordance with project&#13;
               objectives. The Government will allocate and pay over counterpart funds for the projectby&#13;
               bank transfer. Counterpart funds are allocated throughthe normal central govemment&#13;
               budgetary process. Counterpart funds i s accessedthrough compliance with the country&#13;
               specific FinancialRegulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PMIUhas a Finance Department headedbythe financialmanager (or senior accountant) who directs and&#13;
guides the financial management operations o f the implemented project. The Financial Management&#13;
Advisor (FM Advisor) reports to the PMIUCoordinator. The FinancialManager i s incharge o f&#13;
maintaining the books and records o f the projects financed by donors as well as supervisory&#13;
responsibilities over the other accountants that includetwo accountants (one o f which shall commence&#13;
working after project effectiveness).&#13;
&#13;
The newly recruited staff (financial manager, accountants) will be trained as appropriate, inthe following&#13;
areas: (a) financial management, including internalcontrols, information systems and computer&#13;
applications; and (b)proceduresrelating to procurement, financial management and disbursement&#13;
guidelines and govemment regulations. Coaching will be providedby the financial management advisor.&#13;
&#13;
The staff inPMIU's Finance Department i s experienced and qualified. This i s illustrated below:&#13;
&#13;
         0     the financial manager shouldbe a professional accountant with a CPA. He/she also holds a&#13;
               Masters degree inManagement, with at least ten years o f experience inaccounting and&#13;
                finance, preferably with the Bankprojects;.&#13;

&#13;
Financialmanagement arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Internal Controls and Financial Management Manual&#13;
&#13;
The project's internalcontrols are documented ina FinancialManagement Manual. The PMIUwill&#13;
update the manual regularly to take into account any changes inprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
The procedures usedby the project to maintainits records will be documented inits Financial&#13;
Management Manual. These will include the requirement for cross references to supporting&#13;
documentation inthe SOE inorder to facilitate the audit o f these expenditures and improve the&#13;
maintenance o f the project's records.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      101&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TheFMManualwill describefor the accounting system: the major transaction cycles o ftheproject; funds&#13;
flow processes; the accounting records, supporting documents, computer files and specific accounts inthe&#13;
financial statementsinvolved inthe processing of transactions; the list o f accounting codes usedto group&#13;
transactions (chart of accounts); the accounting processes fkom the initiation of a transaction to its&#13;
inclusioninthe financial statements; authorization proceduresfor transactions; the financial reporting&#13;
process usedto preparethe financial statements, including significant accounting estimatesand&#13;
disclosures; financial and accounting policies for the project; budgetingprocedures; financial forecasting&#13;
procedures; procurement and contract administration monitoringprocedures; procedures undertakenfor&#13;
the replenishment ofthe Special Account; and auditingarrangements.&#13;
&#13;
Planningand Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
Cashbudget preparation will follow the government procedures. Detailedprocedures for planningand&#13;
budgetingwill be documented inthe FinancialManagement Manual. Financialprojections or forecasts&#13;
for the life of the projects (analyze by year). will beprepared. On an annual basis, the project&#13;
accountantswill prepare the cash budget for the comingperiodbasedon the work program. The cash&#13;
budget should includethe figures for the year, analyzebyquarter. The cashbudget for eachquarterwill&#13;
reflect the detailed specifications for project activities, schedules(including procurementplan), and&#13;
expenditure on project activities scheduledrespectively for the quarter. The annual cashbudgetwill be&#13;
sent to the TTL at least two months before the beginningof the project fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
Book of Accounts and Chart of Accounts&#13;
&#13;
IDA and counterpart funds will be accountedfor bythe project on a cashbasis. This will be augmented&#13;
with appropriate records andproceduresto track commitments and to safeguardassets. The accounting&#13;
records will be maintained indual currencies on a computerized system. The books of accounts will&#13;
include a cashbook, ledgers,journal vouchers, fixed asset register and a contracts register.&#13;
&#13;
The chart of accounts will facilitate the preparation ofrelevant monthly, quarterly and annual financial&#13;
statements, including information onthe following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0      total project expenditures&#13;
          0      total financial contribution from eachfinancier&#13;
          0      total expenditure on eachproject component/ activity, and&#13;
          0      analysis of that total expenditure into civil works, various categories of goods, training,&#13;
                 consultants and other procurement and disbursementcategories&#13;
&#13;
 Thebooks of Accounts to be usedfor the projectwill be openedand a Chart ofAccounts will be&#13;
 completedbyproject negotiation. Annual financial statementswill be prepared inaccordancewith&#13;
 InternationalAccounting standard(IASs). All accounting and control procedureswill be documented in&#13;
 the financial managementmanual, and will beregularlyupdatedby the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
 Audit arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 InternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
 Considering the overall risk environment there is a needto put inplace a strong internal control&#13;
 mechanism and quality assurance at all levels involved inthe project. The Internal Auditor needs to be&#13;
 certified accountantwith relevant experience inthe development area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        102&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The termofreference should bedetailedinthe financial managementmanualthat will beputinplace.&#13;
The responsibility of the audit will include, but not limitedto: (a) control ofthe fulfilment ofprocedures;&#13;
(b) spot check ofthe subproject to ensure consistencybetweenphysical and financialprogressof&#13;
subprojects; and (c) ex post audits of subprojects. Regular internal audit reports will be submitted to the&#13;
Project Coordinator and the Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
The government will recruit external auditors under TORSacceptable to IDA. Any firm of auditors&#13;
contractedto carry out the audit should meet the IDA'Srequirements interms of independence,&#13;
qualifications and experience. Iti s recommendedthat arrangements for the external audit of the financial&#13;
statements of the project should be communicated to IDAthrough agreedterms of reference.&#13;
&#13;
The external audit will cover all Bank funds and counterpart funds. Consolidated Audited Project&#13;
Accounts, taking into consideration the newAudit Policy Guidelines of the World Bank, shouldbe&#13;
produced. The format to be adoptedwill be documented inthe financial managementmanual. Besides&#13;
expressing aprimary opinion on the audited financial statementsincompliance with an International&#13;
Accounting Standards, the audit report shouldbe submittedto IDAwithin six months after endof each&#13;
financial year. The auditor will be requiredto prepare a separate Management letter givingobservations&#13;
and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements o f accounting records, systems,&#13;
controls and compliance with financial covenants inthe Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Formats of the various periodic financial monitoringreports to be generatedfromthe financial&#13;
management systemwill be developed. There will be clear linkages between the informationinthese&#13;
reports and the Chart o f Accounts. The financial reports will be designedto provide quality and timely&#13;
information to project management, implementingagencies, and various stakeholderson project&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
The following quarterly FMRswill beproducedby the PMIU. They are:-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0    Financial Reports:&#13;
               JSources and Uses of Fundsby FundingSource&#13;
               JUses o fFundsby Project Activity/Component&#13;
&#13;
          0    PhysicalProgress (Output Monitoring) Report&#13;
          0    Procurement Report&#13;
&#13;
The formats will be defined and agreedby negotiationand the project mustbe capable of producing&#13;
FMRs.&#13;
&#13;
 The project may later become eligible to use the report-based disbursementmethod, provided that during&#13;
 project implementation, it (a) sustains satisfactory financial managementratingduringproject&#13;
 supervision; (b) submits FMRsconsistent withthe agreedform and content as explained below; and (c)&#13;
 submitsProject Audit Reports bythe due dates. The project is thenrequiredto submit to the Bankthe&#13;
 following informationinorder to support report-baseddisbursement:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0    Financial Monitoring Report (FMR)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        103&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Special Account (SA) activity statement&#13;
                SA Bank statements&#13;
         e      Summary Sheet o f expenditures under SA for contracts subject to prior review&#13;
                Statement o f Expenditure o f expenditures under SA for contracts not subject to prior&#13;
                review.&#13;
&#13;
The financial statements shouldbe prepared inaccordance with International Accounting Standards. The&#13;
IDA Credit Agreement willrequire the submission o faudited financial statements to the Bankwithin six&#13;
months after the year-end. Inaddition to the monthly reconciliations and quarterly FMR's, PMIUwill&#13;
produce the Project Financial Statements for analytical and audit purposes.&#13;
&#13;
These Project Financial Statements will compose of:&#13;
&#13;
      1. A Statement of Sources and Uses ofFunds/ CashReceiptsandPayments for each funded&#13;
         phase which recognizes all cashreceipts, cashpayments and cashbalances controlledby the&#13;
          entity; and separately identifies payments by thirdparties on behalf o f the entity.&#13;
&#13;
     2. The Accounting Policies Adopted and ExplanatoryNotes. The explanatory notes should be&#13;
          presentedina systematic manner with items on the Statement o f CashReceipts and Payments&#13;
          being cross referencedto any related information inthe notes for eachfunded phase. Examples&#13;
          of this informationinclude a summary o f fixed assets by category o f assets, and a summary o f&#13;
          SOE Withdrawal Schedule, listingindividual withdrawal applications; and&#13;
&#13;
      3.  A ManagementAssertion that Bank fundshavebeenexpendedinaccordancewiththe intended&#13;
          purposes as specified inthe relevant World Bank legalagreement for each funded phase.&#13;
&#13;
Indicative formats o fthese statements will be developed inaccordance with IDA requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Information systems&#13;
&#13;
P M I Uwill select and install a computerized accountingpackage to be usedby EMRP, and train staff in&#13;
the use o f the software incompliance with the financial management manual. The accounting software&#13;
shouldbe able to produce FinancialMonitoring Reports andto linkbetweenphysical progress and&#13;
financial outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement arrangements&#13;
&#13;
A BankProcurement Specialist (PS) has carriedout an assessmento fthe procurement capacity o fthe&#13;
PMIU. Procurement by the PMIU will be under the management o f the Procurement Specialist. There&#13;
are no specific Procurement arrangements that specifically impactthe FMarrangements.&#13;
&#13;
For IDA funds, the project will observe procurement procedures outlined inthe Guidelines: "Procurement&#13;
under IBRDand IDA Credits and guidelines for the Use o f Consultants by the borrowers and by the&#13;
world Bank as executing agency The financial manager, accountants, internal auditor and support staff&#13;
mustbe conversant withthe Bank's procurement procedures, as internalcontrol issues andthe incurring&#13;
o f liabilities will be matters o f concern to the financial management function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        104&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
All costs are inclusive of taxes andduties. government will finance 100percent of: (i) and duties&#13;
                                                                                       taxes&#13;
(estimated at arate of 10%); (ii) expenditures for maintenance services; (iii)&#13;
                                                                            operating costs; and (iv)&#13;
recurrent costs. Inaddition, government will finance: (i) percent of counterpart funding for works and&#13;
                                                            15&#13;
goods undercomponent A; (ii)     20 percent of counterpart fundingfor works and goods under component&#13;
Brehabilitationandreconstruction ofcritical infrastructure; and (iii) percent ofcounterpart funding for&#13;
                                                                     20&#13;
technical assistance and engineering and consultant services. The disbursement schedule i s expectedto&#13;
be as follows: US$2 million (5 percent) i s expectedto be disbursed during IDA fiscal 2005, US$21&#13;
million (421 percent) duringfiscal 2006, U S 1 9 million (37 percent) during fiscal 2007, andUS$8&#13;
million (167 percent) during fiscal 2008.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly financial MonitoringReports (FMRs) produced by the&#13;
project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial managementcapacity will enable&#13;
PMIUto establish effective financial managementand accounting systems, which should facilitate the&#13;
produce the FinancialMonitoring Report (FMR).&#13;
&#13;
While the first years disbursementswill bemadethrough the "transaction baseddisbursements" method,&#13;
it is expectedthat thereafter the projectwill disbursethrough the "Report-based disbursements". Inthis&#13;
method, disbursementswill take place basedon the submission to the World Bank of quarterly Project&#13;
Monitoring Reports (PMRs). Where the borrower requestsconversion to report-based disbursements, a&#13;
reviewwill be undertaken to determine whether the project has inplace an adequate accounting and&#13;
reporting system, includingprocurement/ contract managementsystemthat can provide the appropriate&#13;
data on major procurement and contracts as well as full financial and output monitoring indicators&#13;
produced quarterly as requiredby the Bank. The adoption of report-based disbursementsby the project&#13;
will enable itto move away fromtime consumingvoucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
 SpecialAccounts&#13;
&#13;
Itis anticipatedthat the project will have two SpecialAccounts. These SpecialAccounts openedina&#13;
 commercial bank acceptableto IDA, will be operatedinaccordance with the Bank's operational&#13;
 guidelines. Special Account A i s for the proceedsof the IDA Credit. Special Account B i s for the&#13;
proceedsof the IDA Grant.&#13;
&#13;
 Disbursementsfrom IDA would be initiallymade on the basis of incurredeligible expenditures&#13;
 (transaction baseddisbursements). IDAwould thenmake advance disbursement from the proceedsof the&#13;
 Credit and o f Grant by depositing into a Borrower-operated Special Accounts to expedite Program&#13;
 implementation. The advance to the Special Accounts would be usedby the Borrower to finance IDA'S&#13;
 share o fprogramexpenditures. Another acceptablemethodof withdrawing funds from the Credit i s the&#13;
 direct payment method, involving direct payments from the Credit to a thirdpartyfor works, goods and&#13;
 servicesuponthe Borrower's request. Paymentsmay also bemade to a commercialbank for&#13;
 expenditures against IDA special commitments covering a commercialbank's Letter of Credit. IDA'S&#13;
 Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimumapplication value for direct payment and special commitment&#13;
 procedures.&#13;
&#13;
 To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, uponproject&#13;
 effectiveness, the PMIUwould be requiredto submit a withdrawal applicationfor an initialdeposit to the&#13;
 Special Account, drawn from the IDA Credit. Uponeffectiveness, IDA would deposit the amount o f&#13;
 US$0.5 million into the Special Account A. The authorized allocation is US$2.5 million for both Special&#13;
 Account A and Special Account Bbut during interim implementationarrangements only an amount of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     105&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$0.5 million would be available for Special Account A. Special Account B would have no initial&#13;
deposit duringinterim implementation arrangements. Direct payments o fup to US$2 million could be&#13;
made from the Grant Account. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the Special Accounts will be made&#13;
upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected instatements o fexpenditure andor on&#13;
fulldocumentationfor paymentsabove thresholds for statements ofexpenditure. The SpecialAccounts&#13;
would be usedfor all payments inferior to 20 percent o f the authorized allocationand replenishment&#13;
applications would be requiredto be submitted regularly on a monthly basis. Ifineligible expenditures&#13;
are found to have been made from the Special Accounts, the Borrower will be obligated to refundthe&#13;
same. Ifthe Special Accounts remains inactive for more than six months, the Borrower may be requested&#13;
to refundto IDA amounts advanced to the Special Accounts. IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe&#13;
Development Financing Agreement, to suspend disbursement o f the funds, ifreportingrequirements are&#13;
not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures(SOEs)&#13;
&#13;
All applicationfor the withdrawal o fproceeds fromthe credit willbe fully documented, except for: (a)&#13;
contracts withan estimatedvalue o f less than US$500,000 for work packages; (b) contracts with an&#13;
estimated value o f less thanUS$200,000 for equipment and goods; (c) contracts with an estimatedvalue&#13;
o f less than US100,OOO for consulting firms, and less than US$50,000 for individual consultants; as well&#13;
as training and incremental operating which may be claimed on the basis o f statement o f expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). Documentationsupporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by PMIU, and&#13;
willbe available for review when requestedby IDA supervision missions and auditors. All&#13;
disbursements are subject to the condition o f the DevelopmentFinancingCredit Agreement and the&#13;
procedures defined inthe Disbursement letter.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementation begins, the quarterly financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) producedby the&#13;
project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial management capacity will enable&#13;
P M I Uto establish effective financial management and accounting systems, which should facilitate to&#13;
produce the Financial Monitoring Report (FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a&#13;
timely basis, and a borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be&#13;
undertakenby the task team leader (TTL),to determine ifthe project i s eligible. The adoption o freport-&#13;
baseddisbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming voucher by&#13;
voucher.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A.      Projectbackground&#13;
&#13;
The Government ofAngola (government ) hasreceivedfinancing fromthe InternationalDevelopment&#13;
Association (IDA) equivalent to US$ 50.7 million for the Phase 1Emergency Multisector Recovery&#13;
Project. The total project cost i s estimatedat US$91million. The project will be implemented bythe&#13;
MinistryofPlanning. Theproject isexpectedto start from about April 2005 for about 3 years. The&#13;
Project Management and ImplementationUnit (PMIU) intends to appoint a findindividual financial&#13;
managementconsultant (called FinancialManagement Technical Support Consultant           - FMTSC)  to&#13;
provide technical support for the operation of the project financial managementsystem, and to provide&#13;
training servicesto the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectComponents:The proposed project comprisesfour components: (a) rural development and&#13;
delivery of social services; (b) rehabilitationandreconstruction of critical infiastructure(water supply);&#13;
(c) capacity building, institutional strengtheningand development of sector strategies; and (d)&#13;
managementand monitoring of the project.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements:The project's activities will be managedunderthe Project Management&#13;
and ImplementationUnit(PMIU) under the MinistryofPlanning. The PMIU i s headedbythe Project&#13;
Coordinator who i s the Vice-Minister of Planning, assistedbythe Project Administrator andthree&#13;
internationalconsultants for project monitoring, financial managementandprocurement. A financial&#13;
manager(senior accountant), one or two accountantsand one or two procurement staffwillbe appointed&#13;
to support the project implementationactivities.&#13;
&#13;
ThePMIUwill ensure efficient coordinationamongdifferentagenciesandministriesthat participate in&#13;
the project, including, butnot limited, to Rural development, Health, Education, Transportation,&#13;
Electricity, Water Supply, Urban Services. The PMTUwill also constitute the operational linkto the IDA&#13;
and other donors on matters relatedto the implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.      SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
&#13;
The scope of services could be modified based on mutual agreement between the Client and the&#13;
Consultants with a view to better achieving the overall objectives. Keeping inview the overall objectives&#13;
and scope of work, the Consultants would outline the specific steps which would be carried out and their&#13;
approach, early on duringtheir assignment (intheir InceptionReport -to be providedwithin45 days after&#13;
commencement of their assignment).&#13;
&#13;
The overall objectives o fthe assignment i s to assistthe PMIUto:&#13;
    &gt;    develop accounting and budgeting capabilities for the project through the design of a&#13;
         comprehensive and reliable financial management system (FMS), commensurate with the size&#13;
    &gt;    and scope of the project;&#13;
        preparethe Financial Management Manual;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Financial Management and Information Systems would be integrated and a common set of policies&#13;
and procedures would apply to the entire project, and a consolidated set of financial reports for the project&#13;
would beprepared from the FinancialManagement System.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagementSystem(FMS): To ensure that all financial managementaspects (including&#13;
necessary financial and accounting aspects) ofthe Project are satisfactorily handled. A common financial&#13;
management system for the whole project has to be designedand a computerized financial management&#13;
systemhas to be developed. The financial managementsystemi s to be documentedina Project Financial&#13;
Management Manual. The FinancialManagement Advisor wouldprovide the requiredtechnical support&#13;
to project financial staff, including hands-onoperational support, and beresponsible to ensure that the&#13;
service standards for financial managementactivities indicatedinthe Project FinancialManagement&#13;
Manual are met. The financial managementsystemto be designedwill include the following aspects:&#13;
&#13;
1.       FundsFlow Mechanism:Designof a systemfor flow of funds fromIDAto theprojectand&#13;
subcomponents. The major factors to be taken into account indeveloping the systemfor flow of funds&#13;
are: (i) ensure smooth flow o f funds; and (ii) ensure adequateinternal control arrangements for&#13;
        to                                         to&#13;
proper utilization, managementand accounting of funds. This would include development of policies,&#13;
procedures and arrangements for receipt of funds fromvarious sources to the project and for disbursement&#13;
to the various parties. The following bank accounts will be maintainedfor the purposesof implementing&#13;
the project:&#13;
    &gt;    Special Accounts: Denominated inU S dollars, disbursementsfromthe IDACredit and the IDA&#13;
         Grant will be deposited onaccount for activities financed under the project.&#13;
    9 PMIUProiectAccount: Thiswillbedenominatedinlocalcurrency. Counterpart fundswillbe&#13;
         deposited onthis account inaccordancewith the project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
These bank accounts shall be openedat the Banco PoupancaCredit0 (BPC) by credit effectiveness date.&#13;
Initialcashflow forecasts uponwhich the advance disbursement will be made from the IDA Credit and&#13;
from the IDA Grant should also be preparedby the same date. The account signatories will benominated&#13;
bythe MinisterofPlanningand documentedinthe FinancialManagement Manual.&#13;
&#13;
2.       AccountingSystem:The accounting systemshould cover the entire project, i.e. all sources of&#13;
funds for the project andutilizationof funds bythe project. The accounting systemwould bebasedon&#13;
principals of double-entry bookkeeping. The design of the accounting systemwould include among&#13;
others the following aspects:&#13;
&#13;
That the overall operation ofthe project financial management systemare satisfactory. This shall include&#13;
the following aspects: (i) a satisfactory unifiedfinancial and accounting system i s installedand&#13;
                             that&#13;
operational; (ii)  that the service standardsfor financial management aspects indicatedinthe Project&#13;
Financial Management Manual are met. Accounting books and records should be up-to-date and&#13;
satisfactorily maintained; (iii)  that flow of funds to the project and to the various componentsi s smooth;&#13;
(iv) financial policies andprocedures outlinedinthe Project FinancialManagement Manualare adhered&#13;
to; (v) the internal control system, including aspects suchas internal checks, reconciliations, verification&#13;
of assets, etc i s satisfactory, and commensuratewith the size and scope ofthe project; (vi) the budgeting&#13;
system and forecasting system i s satisfactory. Budgetsand work plans should be satisfactory and&#13;
satisfactory short-term forecasts should beprepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    a) Developmentof Chartof Accounts: The Chart of Accounts would be usedto capture financial&#13;
         data under appropriate headings, and classify and group financial data for the various financial&#13;
         reports. The structure o fthe Chart of Accounts shouldcater for data to be capturedby: (i)   project&#13;
         components and sub-components; (ii)      categories of expenditures; and (iii) disbursement&#13;
         categories. The structure of the Chart of Accounts shouldconform closely with the project cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        112&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        tables to enable comparison of actual project costs with those estimatedduringthe project&#13;
        preparation.&#13;
&#13;
    b) DevelopmentofFinancialandAccountingPolicies: Simple, clear andtransparentfinancial and&#13;
        accounting policies, whichwould govern financial managementof, and accounting for the project&#13;
        should be developed. These would includeboth: accounting policies for accounting and financial&#13;
        reporting for the project; and (ii)  financial policies andprocedures e.g. policies andprocedures&#13;
        for transfer of funds and accounting for expenditures(including advancepayments, recoveryof&#13;
        amounts); policiesregarding expenditureswhich canbe treated as project expenditures, and the&#13;
        classificationofthese expendituresunder appropriate headings inthe Chart of Accounts.&#13;
&#13;
    c) Format of Books andRecords: Formats of the various accounting books, records and statements&#13;
        e.g. cashand bankbooks,journals, various ledgers, trial balance, vouchers, control books should&#13;
        bedesigned.&#13;
&#13;
    d) Identification and establishmentof linkagesbetweenprojectexpenditures and physical&#13;
        activities: Importantitems on whichphysical data, which would be captured, andwhich would&#13;
        beincludedinthe financial reports shouldbeidentified. Methods of capturing thephysical data,&#13;
        and linkages with financial reports should be identified.&#13;
&#13;
   .e) Developmentof Financialand AccountingProceduresfor various types of transactions: The&#13;
        most important considerations indesigning the various procedures are to ensure: (i)satisfactory&#13;
                                                                                               a&#13;
         systemof internalcontrols; and (ii)    smooth working/operationof the financial systemincluding&#13;
        appropriate delegation of powers. Theseprocedures shouldincorporate standardinternal check/.&#13;
        ContSrols such As delegation and separationof duties, authorization of transactions, physical&#13;
        custody o f assets, periodic and regular reconciliation, independentverification, conformity to&#13;
        project procurement policies andprocedures. Giventhat the systemwould be a computerized&#13;
         system, internal controls should also include aspects such as controls over data integrity, etc.&#13;
&#13;
    f ) That Annual Project Financial Statementsare satisfactorily and are prepared inatimely manner.&#13;
         It i s expected that the project financial statementsare prepared within 3 months ofthe end of each&#13;
         FiscalYear andpresentedto the project auditors for audit. The audited annual project financial&#13;
         statements shouldbeprepared within 6 months of the endof the FiscalYear as agreed inthe&#13;
         financing agreementswith the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
3.       BudgetingSystem: The budgetingsystem should be integratedwith the accounting systemto&#13;
enable comparison of actual performance withbudget/ targets (quarterly, annual and cumulative for the&#13;
project).&#13;
&#13;
4.       System for Preparation of Financial Forecasts: Financial forecasts should be based on&#13;
projected work programs and actual performance. Forecasts should include both short-term forecasts&#13;
(two quarters) and longer-termforecasts.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Procurementand Contract AdministrationMonitoring System: This system isneeded for&#13;
monitoringprocurement processing of all major contracts; for recordingcommitments, expenditures and&#13;
performance of these contracts; for generating procurement source data of all major contracts; and for&#13;
monitoring procurement according to various procurement methods. This system should be linkedto the&#13;
financial accounting systemwherever needed(e.g. for recordingexpenditure on major contracts).&#13;
&#13;
6.      FinancialReporting:Formats ofthe various periodic financial reports to be generatedshouldbe&#13;
developed. The financial reports should be substantially generatedfrom the computerized FMS.&#13;
Therefore these should be clear linkage between the information intheses reports andthe Chart of&#13;
accounts. The financial reports shouldprovide quality and timely informationto project management and&#13;
various stakeholders onproject performance. Consolidated financial reports for the whole project should&#13;
                                                        113&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be generated. The financialreports should includeamong others: (i) fro preparation ofwithdrawal&#13;
                                                                       data&#13;
applicationto be submittedto the world bank for reimbursementof expenditures; (ii)      annual financial&#13;
statements; and (iii)all the financial monitoringreports to be usedto monitor project performance. These&#13;
reports include financial statements: cashflow statements, expenditures classified byproject components,&#13;
disbursement categories, and comparison with budgets, as well as short-term forecasts ofexpenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Project FinancialManagement Reports of satisfactory quality should beprepared on a timely basis; and&#13;
disseminated to the various project stakeholders. It i s expectedthat quarterly reports willbeprepared&#13;
within 15 days ofthe endofthe reportingperiod. Analysis and summariesofthe various reports to&#13;

I. OverviewofEmergencyMultisectorRecoveryProject&#13;
&#13;
Background:The Government ofAngola (government ) hasreceived financing fromthe International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) equivalent to US$ 50.7 million for the Phase 1Emergency Multisector&#13;
Recovery Project. The total project cost i s estimated at US$91 million. The project will be implemented&#13;
by the MinistryofPlanning. The projectis expectedto start fromabout April 2005 for about 3 years.&#13;
The Project Management and ImplementationUnit (PMIU) intends to appoint a fidindividual financial&#13;
managementconsultant (called FinancialManagement Technical Support Consultant - FMTSC) to&#13;
provide technical support for the operation of the project financial managementsystem, and to provide&#13;
training services to the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectComponents:Theproposedproject comprises four components: (a) ruraldevelopment and&#13;
delivery of social services; (b) rehabilitation andreconstruction of critical infrastructure (water supply);&#13;
(c) capacity building,institutional strengthening and development of sector strategies; and (d)&#13;
managementand monitoring of the project.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements:The project's activities will bemanagedunderthe ProjectManagement&#13;
and ImplementationUnit (PMIU) under the Ministryo fPlanning. The PMIUi s headedby the Project&#13;
Coordinator who is the Vice-Minister of Planning, assistedby three international consultants for project&#13;
monitoring, financial managementand procurement. A financial manager, one or two accountantsand&#13;
one or two procurement staffwill be appointed to support the project implementation activities.&#13;
&#13;
The PMIU will ensure efficient coordination among different agencies and ministries that participate in&#13;
the project, including, but not limited, to Rural development, Health, Education, Transportation,&#13;
Electricity, Water Supply, Urban Services. The PMIU will also constitute the operational link to the IDA&#13;
and other donors on mattersrelated to the implementationof the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     Tender objectives&#13;
&#13;
    1. Informationsystems: PMIUwill be usingan Accounting software. The staff will be trained in&#13;
        usingthe software that canproduce FinancialMonitoring Reports and linkagebetweenphysical&#13;
        progress and financial outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
    2. AccountingSystem: A common financial management systemfor the whole project has to be&#13;
        designedand acomputerized financial management systemhasto be developed. The financial&#13;
        management system is to be documented ina Project FinancialManagement Manual. The&#13;
        computerized financial management wouldhave facility to produce the various financial books&#13;
        and records, financial reports; and to consolidate the records andreports for the whole project.&#13;
        Thebooks ofaccountsto bemaintainedspecifically for EMRPshould thusbe set upand should&#13;
        include: a CashBook, ledgers,journal vouchers, fixed asset register and a contracts register. The&#13;
        books o f accounts will be maintainedon a computerized system. A list of accountscodes (Chart&#13;
        of Accounts) for the project shouldbe drawn up. This should matchwith the classification of&#13;
        expenditures and sourcesand application of funds indicatedinthe Credit Agreement. The Chart&#13;
        of accounts should be developed ina way that allows project costs to be directly relatedto&#13;
        specific work activities and outputs of the project.&#13;
&#13;
    3. Reportingandmonitoring:Formats of the various periodic financial monitoring reports to be&#13;
        generatedfrom the financial management system will be developed. There will be clear linkages&#13;
&#13;
                                                     127&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        betweenthe information inthese reports and the Chart of Accounts. The financial reports will be&#13;
        designedto provide quality andtimely information to project management, implementing&#13;
        agencies, and various stakeholders on projectperformance.&#13;
&#13;
The following quarterly FMRswill beproducedbythe PMIU. They are:-&#13;

        o Procurement Report&#13;
&#13;
 III. Financialmanagementvision&#13;
&#13;
The financial managementvision is that all managersacross the organization can access financial&#13;
information from their desk tops, supporting their ability to make resource allocationdecisions and to&#13;
understandthe financial performance of the operations for which they are responsible.&#13;
&#13;
Managers should have the confidence that the financial informationthey use i s accurate, complete and&#13;
consistent across time. They should be able to reachbeyond the boundaries oftheir own responsibility to&#13;
obtain the informationnecessaryto support their decisions. Insome cases, they should be able to&#13;
exchange financial data directly from customers and suppliers. Consolidated views o f various kindsof&#13;
financial information, for example by expenditure or resourcetype, by geographic region andby cost&#13;
center mustbe obtainable. Managers shouldbe able to relate financial information to other information,&#13;
where necessary, includingprogram, policy and human resource information. The financial information&#13;
systemmust also be efficient, inthat it gathers, moves and stores data electronically, with as little needas&#13;
possible for manualdata entry, error correction or reconciliation.&#13;
&#13;
The abovevision impliesthat the following key elements areto besupportedby the financial&#13;
managementapplicationsoftware:&#13;
&#13;
    o A single enterprise-wide, integrated financial informationsystem for the organization, usinga&#13;
        common chart of accounts and controlled sharing of data and information.&#13;
    o Consolidation, drill downdecision support functionality.&#13;
    o Work flow and electronic commerce tools to manage financial data internallyandto interact&#13;
        electronically with suppliers and customers.&#13;
    o A linkage between financial information andrelated operational information, so that decision&#13;
        makers can understandthe impact o fpolicy, programdesign andprogramdelivery alternatives.&#13;
    o A sharedservices financial transaction processing organization structure, to achieve the greatest&#13;
        degree of consistency inthe way inwhich financial data i s recorded, and also to achieve&#13;
        economies of scale.&#13;
    o Streamlined financial policies and business processes that enable smooth processing of reliable&#13;
        financial data while avoidingunnecessarychecks and approvals.&#13;
    o Flexibility to accommodate future&#13;
&#13;
 IV.    Approachto the tender andthe requirementspecificationinAnnex A&#13;
&#13;
The EMRP intends to procure and implementreliable"off-the-shelf" financial managementapplication&#13;
software to support its operations.&#13;
&#13;
Itintendsto contract with a single developer, of financial managementapplicationsoftware, for all&#13;
implementation aspects of the final solution (hereafter referredto as "the Contractor"). It i s&#13;
acknowledged that the chosen Contractor may have to engage other suppliers for certainelements o fthe&#13;
&#13;
                                                    128&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
solution, such as hardware and networks, but EMRPwould wish to transfer the risks for effective&#13;
implementation and initial functioningo f those components to the chosen Contractor. To facilitate this&#13;
arrangement the Contractor will have to investigate and recommend to EMRPall components requiredfor&#13;
successful implementationtogether with draft tenders and indicative costs for each component, the latter&#13;
which should separately specify the management fee to be charged by the Contractor, ifany.&#13;
&#13;
After evaluation and approval by EMRP o f the draft tenders and the Contractor's management fee for&#13;
each component, the Contractor will issue the tenders, for consensus evaluation and decision together&#13;
with EMRP. Finalcontracts withchosen suppliers will bebetween the Contractor and the component&#13;
suppliers. EMRP will pay the Contractor for the cost o f each additional component, plus the agreed&#13;
management fee.&#13;
&#13;
After successful implementation separate contracts will be establishedbetween EMRPand all suppliers&#13;
involved inthe project for the maintenance o f each component - i.e separate maintenance contracts for&#13;
the financial management application software, operating system, hardware, networks, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Thistender request therefore only specifies inh e x A the keyrequirements for the financial&#13;
management applicationsoftware and does not contain detailed specifications for all components o f the&#13;
final solution.&#13;
&#13;
Inspecifyingthe requirements for the financialmanagementapplicationsoftware, itisacknowledgedthat&#13;
most "off-the-shelf' solutions have fairly common functionality, based on general financial management&#13;
functions and conventional accrual-based double entry accounting functions. The approachto the&#13;
specification was not to provide a detailed description o f such general financial management and&#13;
accounting functions, but to rather identify the key requirements to support the operations o fthe EMRP.&#13;
&#13;
Annex A deals with these key requirements, which will also form the basis o fthe evaluation o fthe tender&#13;
responses, together with pricing.&#13;

                      Appendix9: Environmentaland SocialManagementAspects&#13;
&#13;
Environmentaland socialconditions&#13;
&#13;
Angola possesses enormous environmental potential, from itsrichbiodiversity, the richness of its subsoil,&#13;
to the dazzling landscapesinalmost everywhere inthe country. The current knowledge on the country's&#13;
biodiversity i s poor andrepresentsonly part of all the existingecosystems. However, some of the major&#13;
environmental issuesAngola i s facing are desertification, the overuse o fpastures (a result ofthe country's&#13;
increasingpopulation), and the resulting soil erosion. Soil erosion complicates matters further by&#13;
contributing to water pollution and the build-upof dams and rivers. Angola's tropical rain forests are also&#13;
being deforestedinorder to satisfy the international demandfor tropical timber and the domestic need for&#13;
fuel. Such deforestation, occurring at a rate of440 square kilometers ayear, leads to the loss of&#13;
biodiversity. Poaching inwoodland areas and tree bumingare serious concerns. Inaddition, many of&#13;
Angola's endemic species are beingover huntedandreceive no protection, while its protected area system&#13;
i s failing. Food security, water supply and sanitation, and housingshortagesand inadequatewaste&#13;
managementare also key issues.&#13;
&#13;
The country hasratifiedafew international environmental conventions, which stillneedto be fully&#13;
implemented. Many ofthese problems or conditions have resulted fiom decades of armed conflict&#13;
aggravatedby highlevel o fpoverty among the majority of the population inthe country. This was&#13;
mainly due to massive internal migration, highlevels of unemployment, which hadenormous bearing on&#13;
the natural resourcesbase, almost drivingsome of the biological resources, bothflora and fauna, to&#13;
extinction.&#13;
&#13;
Policy,legaland regulatoryframework&#13;
&#13;
Thebasic environmental law, whichwas approved bytheNationalAssembly in 1998defines the main&#13;
environmental legal framework inthe country. These include, among others, regulations on: (i)      accessto&#13;
biologicalresourcesand community rights; (ii)    environmental impacts assessments; (iii)  managementof&#13;
protected areas; (iv) protected species; (v) pollutionpreventionand abatement; sustainableuse and&#13;
managemento fnaturalresources; (vi) land use, mining,and water resourcesmanagementand protection.&#13;
Theregulations governing implementationofthisbasic environmental lawhavebeenprepared, butare&#13;
yet to be approved by the Parliament&#13;
&#13;
The Convention on BiologicalDiversity (CBD) was ratifiedbygovernment in 1998 and other&#13;
conventions are inthe processo fbeingratified. On that premise, the government i s preparing a national&#13;
biodiversity strategy and actionplan.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional capacityof the governmentto manage environmentaland socialissues inprojects&#13;
&#13;
There i s a general weaknesso finstitutionalandhumanresourcescapacity to effectively address and&#13;
mitigate environmental and social aspects, as they relate to development assistance programs and&#13;
projects. This can be ascribed to a number of factors raging from the general instability inthe country,&#13;
following decades of civil unrest, the perpetual restructuring of the department of environmental, which&#13;
changedministries severaltimes inrecent years, precludingtime to reasonably settle down andreflecting&#13;
on environmental issues, preparingand implementing environmental laws, regulations and strategies.&#13;
&#13;
Currently anchored inthe Ministry of Urbanism, Fisheryand Environment, the environmental&#13;
brancwdepartment of the Ministry has only four staffwho bear responsibility to respond and address&#13;
environmental issues inthe country. At present, the department i s not deconcentratedto the rest of&#13;
country, a situation, which i s not conducive to fulfilling their mandate of ensuringdevelopment programs&#13;
are executedincompliance with sustainableuse, managementand protectiono f environmental and&#13;
                                                      134&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
naturalresource base. The departmenthas no database systemon environment andnatural resourcesin&#13;
the country and will be unable to deploy themselves for enforcement o f environmental policies or even&#13;
for regular field trip to inquireon the state of protected areas, nationalparks and other things of that&#13;
nature. They severely lack financial and human resources support, equipment and logisticsto engage in&#13;
any meaningful environmental work. The strengthening of this department would be invaluable both for&#13;
the project and the country of Angola.&#13;
&#13;
Project Category&#13;
&#13;
As an emergencyrecovery operation, the Angola EMRPi sprocessedunderWorldBankOperation Policy&#13;
(OP) 8.50. As such, it i s NOTrequiredto haveproject safeguardinstruments approved and disclosed in-&#13;
country and at InfoShop prior to appraisal. The EMRPi s categorized as B, as decidedby the ROC&#13;
meeting and i s set out to focus on rehabilitationandreconstruction of existing infrastructure, as itrelate to&#13;
the transport, roads and bridges, bothurban andrural, healthservices, electricity access, rural&#13;
development, water supply and drainage and education. At present, the environmental policy (OP 4.01),&#13;
the involuntaryresettlement policy (OP 4.12) -becauseo fthe potential for landacquisition and/or loss o f&#13;
economic activities-and the pestmanagementpolicy (OP 4.09) appearto be triggered. The triggering o f&#13;
the forestry and naturalhabitats will be determinedinthe context of the upcoming ESIA study.&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding the exemption ofthe EMRPto disclose project safeguarddocumentsbefore appraisal,&#13;
butbecause ofthe variety andscale ofthese investmentschemes envisioned inthe context ofthe EMRP,&#13;
there i s a keen sense of urgency and preparednesson the part of the project team to appoint areputable&#13;
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) firm and get the ESIAunderway without delay.&#13;
All individualESIAs, EMPs, PMP andRAPS,as they relate to the various sub-projects are scheduledto&#13;
be completed within one year ofPhase 1project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Although sufficient provision has already been earmarkedto conduct the above studies and implement&#13;
mitigation measurespertainingto EMPs and PMP, the project team i s urgedto prepare all the required&#13;
safeguard documents, including ESIAs,EMPs, PMP and RAPSand detailedcost outlays for&#13;
implementing and monitoring mitigation measures before Board. The advantage of suchurgency i s to&#13;
ensure that costs of mitigations measures that ought to be bome by the project are fully accountedfor.&#13;
&#13;
Dueto the multi-sectoral nature ofthe project, andbecause all the environmental and social impact&#13;
characteristics of subprojects are not known insufficient detail at this time, a programmatic process or a&#13;
strategic approach for environmental and social assessment (including screening and categorization,&#13;
preparation, public consultation, disclosure, review, approval and monitoring) will beput into place and&#13;
implementedover thethreeyear life ofthe project. Inaddition, a Resettlement Policy framework (RPF)&#13;
will be prepared, addressingthe policy, principles,institutional arrangements andproceduresthat the&#13;
Borrower will follow ineach subproject involving resettlement and/or loss of economic activities. Given&#13;
uncertainties regardingthe locationof some of the activities, particularly inthe education component, and&#13;
the complexity ofAngola's environmental andsocial situation, this approachis designedto ensure that&#13;
the selection, design and implementationof all activities comply with World Bank SafeguardPolicies.&#13;
Furthermore, a Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be prepared, as the project envisions to purchase&#13;
pesticides, inthe context of seed production and multiplication designedto alleviate food shortage and its&#13;
negative effects among needy populations.&#13;
&#13;
Because local capacity for environmental and social managementi s currently weak, it i s anticipatedthat&#13;
an environmental consulting firm will be engagedfor a period of three years to manage and overseethe&#13;
Environmentaland Social Management Process, while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-&#13;
job training services throughout the projectperiod. Thisfirmwill work closely withthe Ministryof&#13;
Planningand the implementationunits, the Bank, and the ministries and agenciesconcernedto develop&#13;
procedures that will improve activity quality and sustainability through compliance withWorld Bank&#13;
SafeguardPolicies, while at the same time, beingtime and cost-efficient, so as to facilitate subproject&#13;
planning, approval and implementation.&#13;
                                                       135&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The establishment of this processwill be implementedinthree broadtime-phased activities (as shown in&#13;
Figure 1below):&#13;
&#13;
Activity 1:Establishmentof Environmentaland SocialManagementFramework. This is a Strategic&#13;
or Programmatic Environmental Assessment (SEA) under which all projectrelatedEIAs are carried out&#13;
duringprojectimplementation. This activity willbecarried out prior to credit effectiveness withinone&#13;
year of project effectiveness and will involve: (i)public consultation onthe TOR for the Environmental&#13;
and Social Management Framework (ESMF), the ResettlementPolicy Framework(RPF) and the Pest&#13;
Management Plan (PMP); (ii)     a summary review of environmental and social issues relatedto the&#13;
concerned sectors; (iii) formulation of standardmethods and proceduresspecifyinghow all&#13;
                         the&#13;
subprojects will systematically address environmental and social issues inthe screening, siting, design,&#13;
implementationand operational phases of the subproject lifecycle; (iv) the development of an&#13;
implementationplan, includingcapacity building, to support the environmental andsocial management&#13;
activities at each stage inthe subproject cycle; (v) consultation on the Draft ESMF, RPF, PMP and&#13;
individual EMPsand RAPS;(vi) approval o f those instrumentsby the borrower and the Bank; (vii)&#13;
disclosure of these documents incountry and at Bank InfoShop inWashington. Note that the RPFand&#13;
RAPSare disclosed separatelyas stand-alonedocumentsandcannotbemixedwith the ESIAs and EMPs.&#13;
&#13;
The standardprocedureswill take account of the particularcharacteristics of eachof the sectors involved,&#13;
and will be embodied inan Operations Manual. The basic principles andprocesses enunciated inthe&#13;
Operational Manual will also be summarized inan Environmentaland Social Framework Agreement, in&#13;
which the government of Angola andthe Bank agree to basic environmental and social safeguard&#13;
principles andprocedures, and the country affirms its agreementto carry out all subproject activities in&#13;
accordancewith these procedures. The requirement for the correct implementation of the ESMFwill be&#13;
covenanted inthe DCA.&#13;
&#13;
The EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwill work closely with the PMIUand local stakeholdersto draft the&#13;
Framework Agreement. Duringthe preparation of the Framework, the firmwill also work closely with&#13;
the PMIUto develop a preliminary calendar for annual subproject screeningand categorization,&#13;
assessments, implementation and monitoring arrangements,basedon an initial estimate of subproject&#13;
flow.&#13;
&#13;
Activity2: OngoingSubprojectAssessment andImplementation.This activity includes the carrying&#13;
out of subproject ESIAs, which willbe carriedout underthe umbrella of the ESMF and RPF. Once the&#13;
Operational Manual and FrameworkAgreement are put inplace, the EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwill&#13;
work hand-in-hand with local counterparts to plan and carry out the various safeguardinstruments&#13;
requiredfor this project. This will includesubproject assessments (includingthe screening,&#13;
categorization andrequiredstudies), preparation o f documentation, public consultation and disclosure and&#13;
obtainingnecessary approvals by the Borrower and the Bank, depending on the categorization of each&#13;
subproject. The programmingof these activities will be summarized inAnnual Work PlanReports and&#13;
updatedquarterly.&#13;
&#13;
For subprojects which arebeingdesigned and implementedahead of the finalization of the ESMPF, and&#13;
where specific details on the sitingscale and environmental and social impacts are available, anormal&#13;
project ESIAwill be prepared, including which will follow standardBank SafeguardPolicy procedures,&#13;
including public consultation and disclosure and which need to be approved by the borrower and the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Activity3: InstitutionalCapacityBuilding. An important aspect ofthe EnvironmentalandSocial&#13;
Management Processwill involve institutionalization of the procedures laidout inthe Operational&#13;
Manual and Framework Agreements, and buildinglocal capacity to carry them out. To this end, the&#13;
Environmental ConsultingFirmwill work closely with the PMlUand implementingagenciesto propose&#13;
appropriate and efficient institutionalarrangements for sustainablemanagemento f environmental and&#13;
&#13;
                                                      136&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social issues. Insupport ofthese efforts, and inconjunction with the programof consultations and&#13;
participation, the firmwill provide on-the-job training and conduct in-country workshops for staff inthe&#13;
PMIU, implementing sector agencies, local communities, etc.&#13;

&#13;
Scoping, Consultation and Disclosure for Actions 1and 2. A scoping and consultation process will be&#13;
carried out as a means though which the government will reinforce its commitment to environmental and&#13;
social managementand buildpublic confidence inthe anticipated programdesign and implementation.&#13;
To this end, the Consulting Firmwill assist the government, through a series ofpublic consultations and&#13;
meetings, to verify the scope o fissuesto be addressedwithrespect to the ESMPF and each&#13;
subcomponent, and obtain the views of implementingagencies, local communities, NGOs and affected&#13;
groups. These scoping sessions shouldoccur inLuanda and selectedregional/provinciallocations, so as&#13;
to obtain a representative sample ofpoints of view throughout the country. The Environmentaland&#13;
Social Assessment ProcessFramework Report and the subproject EAs will includean Appendix&#13;
providing a record of these meetings, with a list o fparticipants and the proposals andrequests for&#13;
informationmade inthe course o f the meetings. This would include comments from government&#13;
agencies, affected parties and nationalAoca1non-governmental organizations. For the ESMPF and&#13;
subproject Category A projects a public consultation will be heldon the TOR and on the Draft ESMF and&#13;
RPFreports. For the subprojects Category B ESIAs andthe PMP, public consultation will beheld only&#13;
onthe Draft ESIA and PMP reports.&#13;
&#13;

                                                         138&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Inaddition, the firmwillworkwiththeprojectmanagementtodesignaprojectcommunicationsand&#13;
participatory program, whichwill lay out the subproject scoping and consultationprocess including the&#13;
broadapproach, frequency and substantive issues to be discussed with electedofficials, NGOs and other&#13;
community groups.&#13;
&#13;
All environmentaland social assessments, environmental and social managementframeworks andplans,&#13;
will needto be disclosed incountry and at the InfoshopinWashington DC. As it is likely that the policy&#13;
on Involuntary Resettlement (4.12) will be triggered because of landacquisition, the disclosure&#13;
requirement will also includeresettlement frameworks, resettlement plans andprocess frameworks.&#13;
Documents resulting fromthe ESMPFand the EAsprepared under the project, this means all documents&#13;
which result from the Bank's SafeguardPolicies, such as an Indigenous PeoplePlan, need to be disclosed&#13;
incountry andinthe Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
Major issues: As noted, the overall environmental and social issuesassociatedwith eachsector will be&#13;
identified duringthe development of the Environmentaland Social Management Framework. These will&#13;
be divided into potential effects duringthe initialsitingldesigdconstruction periodand duringthe&#13;
operational period o f eachtype of investment. Below is a preliminary identification ofpotentialissues.&#13;
&#13;
Component A: Support to Social Sectors and Ruraldevelopment.&#13;
&#13;
Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
        Restoration of Supply Response of Agricultural Produce: particularly food crops inrural areas&#13;
        mainly through distributing,producing and multiplyingseeds, distributingsmall farming tools&#13;
        andproviding animal health services and water for animal and human consumption. Underthis&#13;
        sub-project, the project i s setout to engage inprocurement ofpesticides for production and&#13;
        multiplication o fbasic seeds, so as to secure expectedyields andprotect, insome cases,&#13;
        production while instorage. This will entail the triggeringof the PestManagement policy and,&#13;
        on that premise, the project i s requiredto develop a Pest Management Plan. Inconsultation with&#13;
        the project team (TTL) and the Borrower, the Consultant firmwill prepare the PMP, addressing&#13;
        the following 4 major issues, namely: (i)   Pest managementapproaches; (ii)Pesticide use and&#13;
        management; (iii)  Policy, regulatoryFramework and institutional capacity; and (iv) Monitoring&#13;
        and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
        Rehabilitation of rural roads and access tracks foreseen for Phase 2 of theEMRP): Since all&#13;
        road improvements are expectedto be carriedout on existing alignments and first focus on spot&#13;
        improvements, the potential for major impacts relatedto landuse, hydrology andresettlement are&#13;
        considered minimal. Duringthe construction phase, direct impacts needto be considered, such as&#13;
        borrow sites, disposal sites, acceleratederosion, degradation of the naturalvegetation and social&#13;
        impacts of construction camps, includingthe risko fHIV/AIDS. Other social issuesmay involve&#13;
        the existence of refugeesand squatters on agricultural landbeing developed by the subproject,&#13;
        which would trigger OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). Duringthe maintenance/operations&#13;
        phase, potential impacts may include increasedaccident levels due to higher speeds andpotential&#13;
        impacts oftraffic on sensitive biological systems or protected areas, increasedpoachingo f&#13;
        bushmeat and increasedlogging o f tropical hardwood. Social benefits include employment&#13;
        duringthe construction and operations phases.&#13;
&#13;
Health services. Sitingofhealthcare facilities (foreseen to berehabilitatedinPhase 2) shouldtake into&#13;
consideration proximity to populated areas, drainage considerations and sanitary facilities. Support&#13;
should be givento facilities and educational programs aimed at reducingHIV/AIDSinfection. Utilization&#13;
and disposal of medical waste should be explicitly plannedfor duringthe operational period. Handling,&#13;
and disposal of medical wastes (hospital wastes) needa special environmental managementplan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      139&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education. Sitingo f educational facilities (foreseen to berehabilitated inPhase 2) should take into&#13;
consideration drainage, erosion and safety factors, as well as adequate provisiono f safe sanitary facilities&#13;
(water supply and adequate latrine systemaccompaniedby healtheducation how to use and maintain&#13;
them, avoidance of factors that could contaminateboth groundwater and surface water). The design of&#13;
latrines should take into account accidental factors (i.e., ovoidance of large holes that could let a children&#13;
pass through).&#13;
&#13;
DeminingActivities. Landmine contamination inAngola is the result of armed conflicts that beset the&#13;
country for over two decades. The scale and locations of the minefields is, by all accounts, widespread.&#13;
Byand large there areno specific records ofwhere the minefieldsare, nor what types they are (i-e., high,&#13;
mediumor low). To try to demine all thepotentialminiefieldswithinthe country isbeyondthe scope and&#13;
the ability of the EMRP. However, the EMRP will provide support to the demining action initiatedby the&#13;
government of Angola and other donors, suchas UNDP, and local deminingoperators, inits intervention&#13;
zone, particularly when deminingactivities are regardedas a prelude, ablockage to or anecessary step to&#13;
pursuebefore implementation ofagiven sub-project inproject interventionareas. Becausethisproject is&#13;
bothemergency-basedand developmental, the consultant firm should liaise with borrower, UNDP,&#13;
demining operatorsand assess environmental and social issues involved and identify mitigation measures&#13;
to beput inplace to that effect. Again, as discussedabove, our interventionwill be strictly limitedto&#13;
project area of influence andparticularly when demining i s viewed as aprelude or anecessarystep to take&#13;
before implementation a particular sub-project i s carried out.&#13;
&#13;
Component B: Rehabilitation and reconstructionof critical infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Transport infrastructure. Similar to the rural roads and accesstracks, larger transport improvements&#13;
(foreseen to berehabilitatedinPhase 2) are expectedon existing alignments, with minimal chance for&#13;
resettlement. However, this will be verified on a case-by-casebasis during the initial screeningprocess.&#13;
Duringthe construction phase, direct impacts shouldbeconsidered, suchas borrow sites, disposal sites,&#13;
acceleratederosion, degradation o f the natural vegetation, temporary noise, dust and pollution levels from&#13;
construction machinery, and social impacts, such as increasedrisk o f HIV/AIDS and other sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases at construction camps. Other social issues could concern the presence o f squattersin&#13;
areas affectedby the subproject. Duringthe maintenance/operationsphase, potential impacts may include&#13;
increased accident levels due to higher speeds and potentialimpacts of traffic on sensitive ecosystemsor&#13;
protected areas, increasedpoaching of bushmeat and increasedlogging o f tropical hardwood.&#13;
&#13;
Electricity services. Potential issues include the sitingofpower generation and distributionfacilities&#13;
(foreseen to berehabilitated inPhase 2), proximity to populated areas and safety considerations.&#13;
Rehabilitationmight produce hazardous chemicals, such as PolychlorinatedBiphenyls(PCBs) or&#13;
polychlorinatedcontaminated oil etc. Other environmental issues concern right-of-way alignment, tower&#13;
erection and creation of accessroads inotherwise inaccessible environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
Information should be providedregardingrights-of-way, their length,general locations and the borrower&#13;
policies regarding the alignment o f these rights-of-way inrelation to the followingguidelines:&#13;
&#13;
         Allrights-of-way shouldbe alignedtaking environmental factors into consideration, inamanner&#13;
         which will minimize, to the extent possible, the needfor physical alteration and the impact on&#13;
         sensitive naturalhabitats, cultural resources, agricultural lands, andresidentialand commercial&#13;
         areas;&#13;
&#13;
         Land acquisitionmust be carriedout inaccordance with World Bankresettlement policy&#13;
         guidelines, whichrequire identification and quantificationo f any impacts on land-based&#13;
         livelihood, and compensation to landowners andpeople relyingon the landfor their livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
         Where rights-of-way are to be established through remote and currently environmentally&#13;
         inaccessiblesensitive areas, the potential impacts onthe natural environment, population&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      140&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         immigration andnatural resourceexploitation must be assessedand measures adoptedto&#13;
         minimize these impacts;&#13;
&#13;
         Other environmental mitigationmeasures should focus on erosion and sediment control during&#13;
         and after construction and use of low-impact maintenanceprocedures. Reclamation or recycling&#13;
         of waste materials where possible by the contractors or disposal of these materials inan&#13;
         environmentally-friendly manner andincompliance with local laws andregulations and World&#13;
         Bankpolicies. Disposal ofpotentialwaste materialshould be addressedduringthe construction&#13;
         and operational phases;&#13;
&#13;
         the Inthe case of hydropower, impacts on surrounding flora and fauna, impacts on downstream&#13;
         users andpotential for landacquisition shouldbe taken into consideration duringthe siting,&#13;
         design and operational phases. Social issues ofparticular relevance would includepotentialland&#13;
         take and loss of agriculturallandinthe right of way of transmission and distribution lines, and&#13;
         potentialpresence of squattersinthe subproject areas. Other potential social impacts such as the&#13;
         increasedrisk of HN/ATDS and other sexually transmitted diseases at construction sites should&#13;
         beconsidered where applicable. Positive impacts ofrural electrificationmay includefacilitation&#13;
         of a wide range of development endeavors, including evening light for childrenreading,&#13;
         refrigeration for medicines andpower for agro-processing and small enterprises. Negative&#13;
         impacts ofrural electrificationmight be the increaseinmalaria prevalence, ifno adequate&#13;
         mitigation measures are taken (environmental healthissues).&#13;
&#13;
Water supply, sanitation and urban infrastructure. Potential issues include the siting of water supplies&#13;
(foreseento berehabilitatedduringthe Phase 1project) and sanitation facilities (foreseen to be&#13;
rehabilitated inPhase 2) inrelation to populated areas, needfor drainage and avoidance of stagnantwater&#13;
and water-borne diseases (environmental health issues). Solid waste programs needto adequatelyplan&#13;
for appropriate siting andprotection of disposal areas. Social impacts, such as potentialdisplacement&#13;
resulting from urban infrastructure from construction sites, as well as the potential for interface with&#13;
squatters, should be considered where applicable. Health and sanitation aspects of improvedwater&#13;
supplies constitute apotentialbenefitwhichshouldbeexplicitly addressedinthe designofthe&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
In all cases, social benefits include employment during the construction and operations phases, and&#13;
improved access to basic services.&#13;

      (Willbe adaptedto take into accountthe final projectphasingbefore the launching ofthe RFP)&#13;
&#13;
Objective and overview of services&#13;
&#13;
The overall objective of this assignment i s to ensurethat all investmentsand activities financed by IDA&#13;
underthe EMRP filly comply with the World Bank's SafeguardPolicies. Becausethe project is multi-&#13;
sectoral innature, and not all the subproject investments are knownat this time, a programmatic process&#13;
for environmentaland social assessment (includingscreening and categorization), review, approval and&#13;
monitoring will beput inplace and implementedover the three year life ofthe project. Given&#13;
uncertainties regardingthe locationof many subprojects, and the complexity of Angola's environmental&#13;
and social situation, this approachis designedto ensurethat the selection, design and implementation of&#13;
all subprojects comply with World Bank SafeguardPolicies. Under this project, three safeguardpolicies&#13;
appear triggered, including The Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.0 l),     the Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) and the PestManagement Policy (OP 4.09). Onthat basis, the project&#13;
team is requiredto prepare an Environmental and Social Management Framework(ESMF), a&#13;
Resettlement Policy Framework(WF) and a PestManagement Plan (PMP). The triggering o f the&#13;
remaining safeguardpolicieswill bedeterminedinthe context of forthcomingESMF study. Guidelines&#13;
for each o fthe safeguard studies are provided below.&#13;
&#13;
Becauselocal capacity for environmental and social managementi s currentlyweak, an Environmental&#13;
Consulting Firmwill be appointed to conduct all safeguardstudies citedabove and engagedinthe&#13;
management and oversight of the Environmentaland Social Management Process, while providing&#13;
institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services throughout the project period. This firm will&#13;
work closely with the PMIU, the Bank and the implementing agenciesto develop procedures that will&#13;
improve subproject quality and sustainability through compliance with Safeguards. This will be done in&#13;
such a way as to facilitate time- and cost-efficient subproject planning, approval and implementation&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
The establishment ofthis processwill beimplemented inthreebroadtime-phased activities (shown&#13;
schematically inFigure 1):&#13;
&#13;
Activity 1:Establishment of Environmentaland Social Management Process Framework. The first&#13;
activity will be carried out within one year ofproject effectiveness and will involve: (i)summary review&#13;
                                                                                           a&#13;
of environmental and social issuesrelatedto the concerned sectors; (ii)   the formulation o f standard&#13;
methods and procedures specifyinghow all subprojects will systematically address environmental and&#13;
social issues inthe screeningand categorization, siting, design, implementation and operational phases o f&#13;
the subproject lifecycle; and (iii) development of an implementationplan, including capacity building,&#13;
                                  the&#13;
to support the environmental and social managementactivities at each stage inthe subproject cycle. The&#13;
standardprocedures will take account o fthe particular characteristics of eachofthe sectors involved, and&#13;
will be embodiedinan Operations Manual. The basic principles andprocesses enunciated inthe&#13;
Operational Manual will also be summarized inan Environmental and Social FrameworkAgreement, in&#13;
which Angola and the Bank agree to basic environmental and social safeguardprinciples and procedures,&#13;
and the government affirms its agreementto carry out all subproject activities inaccordancewith these&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
The Environmental ConsultingFirmwill work closely with the PMIUand local stakeholders to carry out&#13;
the above tasks. Duringthe preparation o f the Framework, the firm will also work closely with the PMIU&#13;
to develop apreliminary calendar for annual subproject screening and categorization, assessments,&#13;
implementationand monitoring, basedon an initial estimate o f subproject flow.&#13;
&#13;
Activity 2: Ongoing Subproject Assessment andImplementation. Once the Operational Manual and&#13;
Framework Agreement are inplace, the Environmental Consulting Firmwill work hand-in-hand with&#13;
                                                      142&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
local counterparts to plan andcarry out the overall Environmental and Social Management Processfor the&#13;
overall project. This will include subproject assessments(including the screening, categorization and&#13;
required studies), preparationof documentation, and obtaining necessaryapprovals by the Borrower and&#13;
the Bank, depending on the categorization and Safeguardconcerns of eachsubproject. The programming&#13;
o f these activities will be summarized inAnnual Work Plan Reports and updated quarterly.&#13;
&#13;
Activity 3: Institutional CapacityBuilding. An important aspect ofthe Environmentaland Social&#13;
ManagementProcesswill involve institutionalizationof the procedureslaid out inthe Operational&#13;
Manual and FrameworkAgreement. To this end, the Environmental Consulting Firmwill work closely&#13;
withthe PMIUand implementingagenciesto propose appropriate and efficient institutional arrangements&#13;
for sustainablemanagementof environmental and social issues. Insupport of these efforts, the firmwill&#13;
provide on-the-job training and conduct in-country workshops for staff inthe PMIU, implementingsector&#13;
agencies, localcommunities, etc.&#13;

&#13;
Scope of work&#13;
&#13;
Activity 1: Environmental and Social Assessment Process Framework&#13;
&#13;
Goal. Inthis first phase, the EnvironmentalConsultingFirmwill carry out a broadassessment of the&#13;
environmental and social issues associatedwith eachsub-component o fthe project and develop a set of&#13;
operational tools and procedures for systematically considering these issues inthe planningand&#13;
implementation of the subprojects. The proposed operational tools will be applied for the screening,&#13;
categorization, planningand implementingindividual subprojects and will be gearedtoward the&#13;
particularities of the various sectors and subprojectsplanned under the project. The Firmwill be&#13;
responsible for ensuringthat subproject screening and categorization includes explicit criteria to&#13;
determine the presence ofpotential impacts that would trigger the applicationo f the Bank's Safeguard&#13;
                                                         144&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Policies and thus the execution ofrequiredanalyses on individual subprojects. The proposed procedures&#13;
willpropose an institutional framework for assuringconformance with SafeguardPoliciesandmeetsthe&#13;
Bank's requirements for environmental and social review prior to subproject approval. This will include&#13;
the specificationof an efficient system for regular documentation and informationflow at key points in&#13;
the subproject lifecycle, withinthe project structure, the EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwith the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.1:Verification of proposedproject&#13;
&#13;
The consultant will verify the content, scope andphasing ofthe IDAproject andthe broader program.&#13;
This will bebasedonthe project documents, complemented by fielddiscussionswithproject staff and&#13;
additional information gatheredby the Consultant. The Consultant will collaborate with the Project&#13;
Management Unitto develop a simple database listing of all types of subprojects, categorized by&#13;
subprogram, component, sectoral subcomponentand subproject. The EnvironmentalConsultant will also&#13;
design an implementingframework for incorporatingenvironmental and social managementinto the&#13;
subproject lifecycle for eachof each subprogramand subcomponent.&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.2: Environmental scopingand consultationand subprojectscopingmethodology&#13;
&#13;
The scoping and consultation processwill be ameansthoughwhichthe government will reinforceits&#13;
commitment to environmental and social managementand buildpublic confidence inthe anticipated&#13;
program design and implementation. To this end, the Consultant will assist the government, through a&#13;
series of consultations andmeetings, to verify the scope of issues to be addressedwithrespectto each&#13;
subcomponent, and obtainthe views of implementing agencies, local communities, NGOs and affected&#13;
groups. These scoping sessions should occur inKinshasa and selectedregionallocations, so as to obtain&#13;
arepresentative sample o fpoints of view throughout the country. The Environmentaland Social&#13;
Management FrameworkReport will include an Appendix providing arecord of these meetings, with a&#13;
list of participants and the proposals andrequests for informationmade inthe course of the meetings.&#13;
This would include comments from government agencies, affected parties andnationalAoca1non-&#13;
governmental organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, the firmwill work withthe projectmanagementto design aprojectcommunications and&#13;
participatory program, which will lay out the subproject scoping and consultation process including the&#13;
broad approach, frequency and substantive issues to be discussedwith elected officials, NGOs and other&#13;
community groups. Duringimplementation, the Consultant will assistthe government inkeepingrecords&#13;
of meetings and other activities, communications and comments and their disposition.&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.3: Assessment of policy,legaland administrativeframework&#13;
&#13;
The Consultant will review and assessthe most pertinentregulations and standards governing&#13;
environmental quality, health, safety, protection o f endangeredspecies, siting, land use control,&#13;
resettlement, landacquisition, etc, as they relate to the various sectors affectedby the project.&#13;
Internationaltreaties to which the country is signatory will be summarized. The Consultant will also&#13;
assess the institutional responsibilities and capabilities for environmental protectionandmanagementin&#13;
Angola, as well as within the project's implementing agencies. Based onthis assessment, the Consultant&#13;
shouldrecommend: (a) aproject institutional framework that will facilitate the efficient incorporationof&#13;
environmental and social considerations into the subproject planning and implementation processes; (b)&#13;
mediumandlongterm institutional strengthening to ensure that environmental protectionis integrated&#13;
into sector management. These recommendations shouldbe embodied inthe Environmentaland Social&#13;
Framework Agreements (as described inTask 1.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       145&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Task 1.4: National baseline environmental conditions and methodology for subproject baseline&#13;
environmentalconditions&#13;
&#13;
Because o fthe broadnational scope and multi-sectoral breadth of the project, the Environmental&#13;
Consulting Firmwill address the needto characterizebaseline environmental and social conditions at two&#13;
levels:&#13;
&#13;
1.4.1 Overview ofnationalbaselineconditions. This will includeabroaddescription ofthe national&#13;
environmental situation, focusing on major regions, ecosystems, protected areas, special concernsand&#13;
social issues, as they are likely to relate to the various categoriesof subprojects. The following general&#13;
categories of conditions should, at a minimum, be addressed:&#13;
&#13;
    e    Landresources&#13;
    e    Hydrology&#13;
    e    Water quality&#13;
    e    Biological (biodiversity, including forests)&#13;
    e    Air quality&#13;
    e    Socio-economic and cultural resources&#13;
&#13;
Because of the wide range of potentialissues, the Consultant should focus on synthesis of the key issues&#13;
facing the country, with referencesto other sources for more detailed data and documentation.&#13;
&#13;
1.4.2 Methodology for sector and site-specific baseline conditions. Withrespectto eachof the major&#13;
sectors and subproject categories, the Consultant will lay out a generic set of key baseline conditions to be&#13;
assessedon a site-specific basis, taking into consideration the particularecological or social conditions&#13;
that could arise inparticular regions or zones. This would follow the same generalcategories as shown&#13;
above, and couldbepresentedintabular/checklist format, with short explanations of the types and data&#13;
and other informationto be collected (as well as referencesto data sources as noted inthe Overview of&#13;
National Baseline Conditions).&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.5: Methodologyfor determiningpotentialprojectimpacts&#13;
&#13;
For eachof the major categoriesof sectors and subprojects, the Consultant will identify and assess the&#13;
major potential environmental and social issues likely to occur, with respectto eacho f the general&#13;
categoriesmentioned inthe baseline conditions. These impacts shouldbe assessedas they are expected&#13;
to occur duringthe siting/design/construction period and the operational period. Also to be considered&#13;
are potential cumulative effects withinthe sectors, bothdirect and indirect. Ofparticular concernwill be&#13;
how to address the social dimensions of the subprojects, as they relate to refugees, squatters and displaced&#13;
persons. For the programas a whole, the significance o fpotentialimpacts should be assessedinterms of&#13;
risk,that is, their likelihood andintensity. Emphasis shouldbeplacedonidentifyingpotentially&#13;
significant effects invarious parts of the country which are distinguished by topographic, ecological,&#13;
socio-economic, culturalresourcesor other characteristics. The methodology for this assessmentwill&#13;
providethe framework for the development of the programmatic environmental managementplan inTask&#13;
1.6 and the detailed assessmento f subprojects, as described inTask 1.8. Attachment 3 provides a&#13;
preliminary summary of potential issues.&#13;
&#13;
 Task 1.6: Programmaticenvironmentalmanagementplanto mitigateandmonitor potential&#13;
 impacts&#13;
&#13;
For eachof the major categories of sectors and subprojects, the Consultant will recommend a set of&#13;
generic mitigation measures for the significant impacts (includingenhancement ofpositive impacts)&#13;
identifiedinTask 1.5, to be implementedduringboththe siting/design/construction and operational&#13;
periods. Also specified will be the responsibility for implementingand monitoring these measures, also&#13;
&#13;
                                                        146&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 duringthe two periods. For mitigationrelatedto siting, design, construction andmaintenanceactivities,&#13;
 the Environmental Consulting Firmshould cite the appropriate clauses to be incorporated indesign and&#13;
 construction contracts. These specifications should be clear and concise and emphasize the responsibility&#13;
 of the performance output goals ofthe contractors. Particular attention will bepaidto the processto be&#13;
 followed for compensation where there i s potentialfor resettlement or land acquisition. The sector-&#13;
 specific EMP frameworks should be summarizedintabular format, similar to the outline shown in&#13;
 Attachment 2. The development of generic mitigationmeasures will providethe framework for&#13;
 developing sub-project EMPs, as detailedinTask 1.8.&#13;
&#13;
  Task 1.7: Analysis of alternatives&#13;
&#13;
 For the project as a whole, the EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwill consider alternatives for achieving&#13;
 project objectives. This will include a review of the "without project" or "no project" alternative. It will&#13;
 also assess alternative sector policies under consideration inthe Program and ifthere are any&#13;
 environmental implications.&#13;
&#13;
 At asubproject level,the EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwill establish a standardframework that&#13;
 permits an explicit consideration of various alternatives to the specific subproject (including the "no&#13;
 project" alternative). This framework will be displayed ina table that presentsthe principal alternatives&#13;
  and a comparative analysis o f these options, including a description of the proposed alternatives, their&#13;
 capital and operational costs and their potentials for effective implementationunder local conditions.&#13;
&#13;
  Task 1.8: Operational guidelinesfor subproject environmental and social safeguard management&#13;
&#13;
 For eachof the major categoriesof sectors and subprojects, the EnvironmentalConsultingFirmwill, in&#13;
  collaborationwith the implementing agencies, formulate a set of guidelines on the systematic procedures&#13;
  for the incorporationof environmental and social considerations for all subprojects. This willbe&#13;
 produced inan Operational Manual and will include, butnot be limitedto:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
. 0   Scoping and assessmentofpotential impacts and screening for key impacts of individual sub-projects&#13;
      and triggersof various SafeguardPolicies; this will be an inputto the sub-project selection and design&#13;

      arrangements);&#13;
&#13;
  0   Participatory, consultation andpublic disclosure processes; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  0   Documentation requirements and information flow for environmental review and approvals withinthe&#13;

&#13;
  Task 1.9: Environmental and Social FrameworkAgreement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       147&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The standardprocedures, methodsandapproaches for incorporationofenvironmental and social concerns&#13;
into the selection, planning and implementation processes will be summarized inan Environmentaland&#13;
SocialFramework Agreement, inwhich the government and the Bank agree to basic environmental and&#13;
social Safeguardprinciples andprocedures, and Angola affirms its agreement to carry out all future&#13;
project activities inaccordancewith these procedures. The Environmentaland Social Framework&#13;
Agreement will specify the processby which environmental and social assessments for subprojects are&#13;
carried out and sent to the World Bank for review. The EnvironmentalConsulting Firmwill work with&#13;
the government andthe Bank to achieve a consensuson the content and format of these agreements and&#13;
assist Angola to draft the agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.10: Environmental and socialmonitoringplan&#13;
&#13;
The environmental consulting firmwill preparea detailedplanfor monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
project. This will specifyresponsibility for ensuringthat all sub-projects conform to the sub-project&#13;
guidelines(includingmeans of verification andreporting), as well as monitoring overall or cumulative&#13;
environmental issues at the sectoral level.&#13;
&#13;
Task 1.11: Preliminary calendarfor Environmentaland SocialManagementPlans&#13;
&#13;
Based on the anticipated flow of subprojectsidentifiedinTask 1.1, a preliminary schedule for annual&#13;
subproject environmental and social assessmentswill be developed, including public consultations and&#13;
implementationo f the environmental and social managementplans, over the life of the project. This plan&#13;
will beadjusted, at least onan annual basis, to conformto the actual rate at which subprojectsare&#13;
identified and screened.&#13;
&#13;
 Activity 2: Ongoingprogram implementation&#13;
&#13;
Goal: Inthis activity, continuous support will be provided over the life ofthe projectthrough the annual&#13;

Guidelinesfor preparinga resettlementpolicyframework (RPF)&#13;
&#13;
Backgroundand rationale&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank's Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) must be applied to any&#13;
project which displaces people from land or productive resources, and which results inrelocation, the loss&#13;
o f shelter, the loss o f assets or access to assets importantto production, the loss o f income sources or&#13;
means o f livelihood, or the loss o f access to locations that provide higher incomes or lower expenditures&#13;
to businesses or persons. The policy applies whether or not the affected persons must move to another&#13;
location*. The Bank describes all these processes and outcomes as "involuntary resettlement," or simply&#13;
resettlement, even when people are not forced to move. Resettlementi s involuntary ifaffectedpeople do&#13;
not have the option to retain the status quo that they have before the project begins.&#13;
&#13;
Many projects involve multiple subprojects that require landtakings, and for a wide range ofprojects the&#13;
subprojects may not be known at the beginning o f a project because they will be selected at a later date.&#13;
Examples o f such projects include those involving community-based development, social funds, financial&#13;
intermediaries, sector-wide investments, and infrastructure projects and other projects entailing&#13;
construction or land access changes where specific investment decisions will be made duringthe life o f&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
These projects normally require two types o fresettlement planning. Firsti s a Resettlement Policy&#13;
Framework (RPF)that will guide and govern the project as subprojects are selected for inclusion. Second&#13;
are the specific resettlement plans (RAPs, "resettlement action plans") that are done for each subproject&#13;
where the displacement described above will take place. It i s the Borrower's responsibility to prepare&#13;
these documents. The RPFmustbe prepared, accepted, and disclosed publicly before the Bank will&#13;
appraise the project. Ifpart o f the investment program (normally the first year's investments) is decided&#13;
before the project i s approved, then the individual RAPs for such subprojects must also be prepared,&#13;
accepted, and disclosedby the Bankbefore appraisal. Provision mustbe made inthe RPF for the process&#13;
for reviewing and accepting subsequent RAPsbefore any subproject is approved for inclusion inthe&#13;
Bank-supported program.&#13;
&#13;
The RPFis a statement of the policy, principles, institutionalarrangementsand proceduresthat the&#13;
Borrower will follow ineachsubproject involvingresettlement. It sets out the elements that will be&#13;
common to all the subprojects. Preparing it allows the Bank and the Borrower to agree on principles and&#13;
processes, so that these neednot be discussed for every subproject. It also allows project implementers,&#13;
who may be inmany locations, agencies, or communities, to undertake specific subprojects without&#13;
having to re-negotiate fundamental agreements. Where there i s an RPFinplace, the RAP i s a detailed&#13;
actionplan for treating a given set o f people     -- forexample, those who will lose land to the construction&#13;
o f a school, those whose houses will be affected by the laying o f a water or sewage line, or those who will&#13;
be excluded from land they occupy or enter for grazing resources or the operation o f their enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
The RPF and the individual RAPs are fully complementary to one another. The more that i s agreed inthe&#13;
RPF, the lessthat needs to be discussed for eachcase. Where there will be dozens or hundreds of&#13;
subprojects, therefore, it i s obviously muchmore efficient for the project to take the time to get the RPF&#13;
as full as possible. For example, the cost o f compensation for h i ttrees can be calculated a number o f&#13;
different ways: a decision on the method, or on the actual compensation for different kinds o f trees at&#13;
different stages o f their maturity, that i s recorded inthe RPF, i s muchbetter than having each subproject&#13;
make new decisions.&#13;
&#13;
The principles andrequirements underlying bothRPFsand RAPs are contained in OP 4.12. InOP 4.12,&#13;
Annex A, the basic contents o fbothRPFs and RAPSare set out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         150&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachedhere are suggested terms o freference (TOR)for writing an RPF. This TOR i s meant as a guide&#13;
to Borrower teams, to enable them to prepare the ResettlementPolicy Framework. Normally each case i s&#13;
somewhat different fi-om others, and so the drafting team mustbe carefulto ensure that the RPFi s as&#13;
detailed as possible for the project beingprepared. A good TOR will provide the background for making&#13;
the RPF as relevant as possible to the project under preparation, but it will also allow the team writingthe&#13;
RPFthe flexibility to ensure that the RPFtakes fullaccount o fthe situation o fpotentiallyaffected people.&#13;
&#13;
Backgroundand basic objectives&#13;
&#13;
Project description. Providea briefdescription o fthe project, for readers ofthe RPFwho may not see&#13;
other project documentation. Summarize all project components briefly. Be somewhat more specific&#13;
with components and activities for which landacquisition andresettlement are required, showing the total&#13;
"footprint" o f the project -all the locations that various facilities inthe project may touch.&#13;
&#13;
Objectivesand basicterms of preparationof the RFP. Set out the objectives o fthe task o fpreparing&#13;
the RPF. State the basic conditions for the work, and the basic steps inproducing the eventual product.&#13;
&#13;
Specific requirementsfor the contents of the RFP. State that the consultantlpreparation team is to&#13;
prepare an RPFthat meets the requirements elaborated below. The RPFwill specifically note that the&#13;
RPFfollows the WB requirements as statedinthe World Bank's policy on InvoluntaryResettlement(OP&#13;
4.12). State that the RPFwill also be designed to meet the legal requirements of the government. Where&#13;
there are gaps between Bank and government requirements, the team i s to set these out clearly and to&#13;
generate, with other stakeholders as appropriate, decisions as to how to handle such gaps. Indicate that&#13;
the RPF should have clear and fully elaborated sections on:&#13;
&#13;
Project description(see paras 1and 2 above, which should be repeatedand elaboratedinthe RPF)&#13;
&#13;
Impacts,land acquisition,and resettlement. Discuss the land acquisition, or restrictions o f access, that&#13;
may be required. Given the nature o fthe project, describe why resettlement is necessary, and why there&#13;
needs to be an RPF. State the reasons that a full resettlementplan (RAP) or a Process Framework (see&#13;
OP 4.12 for details) cannot bepreparedbefore projectappraisal, and what the sequence o fRAP&#13;
preparations may be duringthe life o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Principlesand objectives governingresettlementpreparation andimplementation. Describe the&#13;
basic principles and visiono fthe resettlement program. State that the resettlement objectives are to move&#13;
(or deprive from resources) as few people as possible consistent with the requirements o f the project, and&#13;
that general principles o f doing no harm, o f avoiding or minimizing resettlement are to be followed inall&#13;
subprojects. Show why acquisitiono f land or resources is needed and resettlement cannot be avoided in&#13;
every case. Demonstrate that the commitment i s to ensure that affected people are meaningfully&#13;
consulted, compensated fully and fairly for their losses, and assisted intheir efforts to improve their&#13;
livelihoods and standards o f living or at least to restore them. Describeany particular conditions inthe&#13;
project and subprojects that may present special problems or opportunities, and show how the&#13;
resettlement will be done, inprinciple, so as to overcome risks or take advantage o f such opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
RAPpreparation,review, and approval. Describethe relationship o fthe RPFto the individualRAPs&#13;
that will be done later for each subproject where there i s resettlement. Show who will write future RAPs,&#13;
and how the implementing agency or some other body (bodies) will be involved inreviewing and&#13;
approvingthem. Recommendwhether some or all RAPSshould be reviewedby the Bank, and how this&#13;
will happen.&#13;
&#13;
Estimatedpopulationdisplacementand categoriesof affectedpeople. There maybe some projects&#13;
for which it i s impossible to estimate eventual displacement, but every effort should be made, inpartto&#13;
estimate budgets, butalso to evaluate consultation requirements and potential challenges to the project&#13;
                                                        151&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
staff. Different categoriesof those displacedmay include, for example, those losing legal title andthose&#13;
without it, those losing lands or those losinghousing or those losingboth, those losingtemporary access&#13;
or those losingpermanent rights, businessor residential property. Discuss the unit of analysis, whether&#13;
"cases" (such as properties or fields), or households or individuals. Discuss whether uniform approaches&#13;
will be taken acrossall subprojects, andhowrecords will bekept.&#13;
&#13;
Legal frameworks for resettlement. Review the national laws governing the taking of land or other&#13;
assets. Because suchlegal instruments may come from many sources -land and water law, customary&#13;
law or sharia, land tenure legislation, urban construction regulations, constitutional guaranteesof&#13;
compensation for takmgs for public utility, and so on-make this section as extensive as i s warranted by&#13;
the case inquestion. Set out the requirements ofthe process for takings shouldbe set out. Discuss&#13;
discrepancies among the various legalinstruments, iffound. Summarize what laws and regulations may&#13;
apply to different categoriesof affected people. Next, set out any requirements of the Bank for&#13;
resettlement that apply to the types of casesthat will arise inthe project. Analyze all gaps between&#13;
national and Bank requirements, and say how such gaps may bebridged.&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility criteria for various categories of affected people. (a) Determine the method for setting a&#13;
cut-off date [see OP 4.121 for eligibility for compensation. (b) Set out the different categoriesofpeople&#13;
affectedbythe project, and show the types of losses suchpeople may suffer, whether to land, income,&#13;
rightsof access, housing, water sources, proximity to work, and others, andincluding combinations&#13;
(house and land, for example). Define the criteria that are to be usedto identify the eligibility for&#13;
compensatory measuresfor eachcategory of affected people, whether lossesarepartial or total, whether&#13;
peoplehave their own landor also rent land, what happenswhenbuildingsare occupiedby more than one&#13;
businesstenant or household, for example. Make the criteria user-friendly,so that those applying the&#13;
principles to subprojects "on the ground" will be able quicklyto identifywhether people affected there&#13;
are eligible for compensatory measures, and how. Describe who willjudge eligibility indifficult cases,&#13;
for example by the use of neighborhood or village committees, or outside experts, and how such&#13;
processeswill work.&#13;
&#13;
Methods of valuing affected assets. Describe the borrower's methods of valuing those assets that it&#13;
deems eligible for compensation, and those that must be compensatedunder the policyprinciples that&#13;
meet the World Bank's requirements. Explain the methods for inventorying assets, assigning values to&#13;
each type of asset, and coming to agreements with eachaffected person or group on the total profile of&#13;
losses and compensation. Present, to the degree possible, an "entitlement matrix" which shows the types&#13;
of affected people, the types of losses, and the forms and amounts of compensatory actions that will be&#13;
taken for eachtype.3&#13;
&#13;
Organizational elements and procedures for delivery of entitlements, including the responsibilities&#13;
of each actor. Describe the process by which individual RAPSfor subprojects will be submitted to&#13;
project authorities, considered and approved, andhow entitlements will be delivered. State who inthe&#13;
overall project organization will be responsible for Resettlement, and what facilities the overall&#13;
resettlement officials will have available to them. Ifthere is no unit or oficer(s) with the training andjob&#13;
description to overseeresettlement issues, describe the way in whichsuch capacity will be developed,&#13;
structured, and given authority. I n an annex,provide TORfor such a unit or oficer(s) and describe&#13;
interim arrangements until such capacity isfunctioning. Describe how subprojects will bereviewedfor&#13;
resettlement, how implementationwill be carriedout once a subproject i s accepted, and how the delivery&#13;
of compensatory activities will take place.&#13;
&#13;
Generic aspects of the implementationschedule, includinghow resettlement will be linked to the&#13;
civil works. Set out the schedule by which resettlement will arise and be treated, bothinterms o f the&#13;
overall managemento f the project and the flow o f subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   One example of an "Entitlement Matrix" is attached as Annex 1&#13;
                                                     152&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Grievance redress mechanisms. Describe the mechanismsavailable to affected people for complaints&#13;
about aspects o ftheir treatment underthispolicy framework. Show how the mechanismwill be&#13;
accessible(interms of language, distance, and cost) to affected people, and what recourse/appealfrom the&#13;
local grievance mechanismmay be available.&#13;
&#13;
Budget, andfunding arrangements. Estimate the overall costs ofresettlement, including funds for&#13;
general oversight and for implementation of subprojects. Show the sources of funds. For large&#13;
subprojects, show the sources of and arrangementsbywhich funds for implementation will be made&#13;
available, and either estimates for "off-the-shelf" (average) subprojectsor average subprojectsby type.&#13;
For community and other small subprojects, estimatethe types and numbers of subprojects and a nominal&#13;
resettlement budget basedon an estimate of how many subprojectsmay involve resettlement. Show that&#13;
the overall budget estimateshave beenincludedinthe project budget.&#13;
&#13;
Methods for consultation with, and participationof, affected people. Consultation i s to be done for&#13;
boththe Resettlement Policy Framework, which sets many of the parametersby which resettlement will&#13;
be carriedout, and the individual RAPSwhich will be done for each subproject. For the RPF, show that&#13;
meaningfulconsultation i s being carried out with abroad array of stakeholdersincludingbothborrower&#13;
officials at every level, andthe types ofpeople who may be the beneficiaries of, and affected by, typical&#13;
subprojects. Show that the draft RPFi s to be, or hasbeen, circulated to interested parties, andthat further&#13;
consultations will take place before finalization. Insert a recordof all such consultations as an annex to&#13;
the RPF. For the individual RAPS,show how the people affectedby the particular subprojectswill be&#13;
consulted throughout the processof RAP formulation, as prescribedby OP 4.12.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring arrangements. Provide an appropriate mechanismfor monitoring the effective&#13;
implementationofresettlement, either as part of the overall monitoring of projectprogress, or separately&#13;
to affirm the achievement o fresettlement goals of ensuring that all affected people are addressed.&#13;
Describe how subproject and overall project achievements will be monitored, and at what frequency, by&#13;
selectedreviews o f a sample of micro-projects, by formal supervision of larger subprojects, or by the use&#13;
of independent monitoring agencies (NGOs,researchers, committees o f affectedpeople, or some&#13;
combination o f actors). Show how the results ofmonitoring will be fedback into project implementation.&#13;
Where appropriate, set up monitoring checklists or templates to focus the work of local monitors.&#13;
&#13;
Template for the design of subproject RAPS.Taking account ofthe degreeof detail achieved inthe&#13;
RPFdesign, provideatemplate for, or description ofthe contentsof, individualRAPSfor those&#13;
subprojects which will require them. Include inthe design the minimuminformationrequiredto&#13;
complement what has already been decided at project level throughthe RPF. At aminimum, ensure that&#13;
the individual RAP will include the nature o fthe subproject, the resettlement impact, the number of&#13;
people affected, baseline census and socio-economic survey information (for larger subprojects) a matrix&#13;
that shows -inthe same terms as the RPF-the entitlements of the categories of affectedpeople, a&#13;
description ofresettlement sites and programs for improvement or restoration of livelihoods and standards&#13;
of living, the subproject budgetand implementationschedule, and a commitment to follow the RPF&#13;
guidance andrequirements inall general matters. Insofar as possible, show any further informationthat&#13;
may beneededwhen the RPFhas notbeen fully developed before project approval, or where the general&#13;
issues inthe RPFare inneed of supplementation on account of differing local laws, special situations or&#13;
effects onpeople, or the additional contributions of specialists to the individualRAPpreparation.&#13;

1. Background&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural development projects supportedby the World Bank may involve agricultural diversification&#13;
into new crops, intensificationof low-technologyproduction systems, expansion intonewhirgin areas&#13;
and change o f cultivationpractices, irrigation development for agriculturalproduction, re-organization of&#13;
agriculturalresearchand extension services, support for farmers organizations and similar programs, or&#13;
procurement of pesticides. Although these agricultural programs are designedto assist farmers to boost&#13;
agriculturalproduction and increase farm incomes, they can havemajor implications for the use of inputs&#13;
such as pesticides and fertilizers.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, public healthdevelopment projects may include the control of vectors of human and livestock&#13;
diseases. Healthprojects generally include improvedtreatment of vector-borne diseases as well as&#13;
environmental managementto keep disease vector populations incheck. However, sometimes the use of&#13;
pesticides to reduce vector populations i s also includedinsuchprojects.&#13;
&#13;
The use ofpesticides may contribute to increasedagriculturalproductionand improvedhumanhealth.&#13;
However, inappropriate or excessiveuse of pesticides often results ina reductiono f agricultural&#13;
production or its sustainability, increasesindisease vectors, adverse environmental and healtheffects, and&#13;
negative effects on other economic activities (e.g. fisheries, tourism). This, inturn, leadsto increased&#13;
economic costs, bothat the farmer level and for the country as awhole.&#13;
&#13;
Adequate measures are therefore requiredat project/program development to promote the appropriate&#13;
managemento fpests and pesticides. This i s to ensurethat increasedand sustainable agricultural&#13;
production and farm incomes are achieved; that vector-borne diseases are managedinsustainablemanner,&#13;
and that the risks to humanhealthand the environment associatedwithpesticide use are kept to an&#13;
acceptableminimum.&#13;
&#13;
The WorldBank's PestManagement SafeguardPolicy (OP 4.09 and BP 4.01 Annex C) was established&#13;
to address these concerns and to assist borrowersto managepests inan appropriate manner. A major&#13;
provision o fthe SafeguardPolicy i s the preparation o f a comprehensive Pest Management Plan, or PMP,&#13;
that will outline the various elements o f and actions neededto be taken to adequately address these&#13;
concerns duringproject implementation.&#13;

&#13;
7.       Policy, regulatoryframework andinstitutionalcapacity&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Policies onplant protection: Assess the government policies on pest management (crop protection&#13;
and vector control) and their consistency with IPMapproaches. Evaluate ifthere direct or indirect&#13;
subsidies for pesticides, donatedpesticides that distort market prices, or other factors that may increase&#13;
reliance on (unnecessary) pesticide use.&#13;
&#13;
Study ifa national IPWIVMPolicy exists and determine whether it i s integratedinto the national&#13;

&#13;
Assess the system for managing unwanted and obsoletepesticides; to what extent might the project&#13;
activities contribute to the accumulation of obsoletepesticides?&#13;
&#13;
8.       Strengthening of nationalcapacities&#13;
&#13;
Onthe basis of the outcome of the abovereviews, and ifnecessary, propose an actionplan containing&#13;
appropriate measures, inproject sub-components, to strengthenthe national capacitiesto improve the&#13;

missions&#13;
&#13;
Describe these activities andpropose realistic performance indicators that canbeusedto evaluate&#13;
progress towards the implementation of sustainablepestmanagement, effectiveness o fmeasuresto&#13;
mitigate pesticide risks, progressinstrengtheningregulatory framework and institutional capacity, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and supervisionplan, implementationresponsibilities, requiredexpertise and cost coverage.&#13;
&#13;
Preparea monitoring and supervisionplan that would be adopted duringproject supervisory missions.&#13;
For example, inthe plan includethe types of expertise requiredat different stages ofproject&#13;
implementation, actual monitoring activities and detailed budget.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Process&#13;
&#13;
For the PestManagement Planto be acceptedas part ofthe project/program, it is essentialthat it is fully&#13;
supported by the Borrower and other nationalkey actors. A lack of ownership bythe interestedparties&#13;
will preclude effective implementationofthe plan. Therefore, the development ofthe PMP should, like&#13;
the development o fthe rest o f the project, be a fully participatoryprocessinwhich the consultant acts as a&#13;
facilitator and a technical resource person.&#13;
&#13;
The consultation processmay include severalor all ofthe stages discussedbelow. This will dependto a&#13;
large extent on the level ofpolicy development and implementationof sound pest managementthat&#13;
already exists inthe country. Itwill also depend onthe size of pest managementcomponent envisaged&#13;
underthe project.&#13;
&#13;
(a)    Desk-top review ofthe available information by the consultant.&#13;
&#13;
       The consultant will review existing Bank documents regardingthe project/program (PCD, PID, EA,&#13;
       PAD, according to availability). Sheihewill also obtain background informationonpest and&#13;
       pesticide managementinthe country, and any existing relevant projects (e.g. through the World&#13;
       Bank, FAO, WHO, UNEP, UNITARweb sites; the web site of the national government; web sites&#13;
       ofrelevant CGIARinstitutes, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
(b)    Firstinformationmeetingwith keyactors inthe country&#13;

                                           MOXICO    PROVINCE&#13;
&#13;
The province of Moxico i s locatedinthe central eastern region of Angola, withborders with Zambia and&#13;
DRC. With an area of 199,780 kilometers' it is the biggestprovince of Angola. The estimatedpopulation&#13;
in2002 was of around 322.000 inhabitants, withavery lowdensityof 1.6inhabitantskilometers'. The&#13;
percentageo f displaced populationduringthe war was estimated at 40 percent, including some 85,000&#13;
displaced inZambia and anunknownnumber displaced inDRC. According to data from UNOCHA,&#13;
some 87,000 displaced personshadreturn to their origin by May 2003 (of which some 39,000 from&#13;
Zambia and DRC). The returnedor returning internally displaced populationupto August 2003 i s&#13;
estimated at 236,054 by Unidade TCcnica de Coordenaqgodas Ajudas Humanithias (UTCHA).&#13;
&#13;
Accessibility and transports. The main access to the province was providedbyrailway (CFB), with the&#13;
road network havingonly a secondaryrole. The province development was historicallybasedinthe CFB&#13;
railway. Withthe destruction of most ofroad andrailway bridges duringthe war, the access to the&#13;
province was basically done by airplane. For instances, duringthe first quarter of 2002 Luenareceived&#13;
almost 35,000 MT of air cargo. All fuel was airlifted from Luanda with the consequentvery highcosts.&#13;
These highcosts almost paralyzed economic activity (duringthe first quarter of 2002 the air cargo out of&#13;
Luena was 106MT). Only 560 kilometers ofroads out of 3,175 kilometers were asphalted. The road&#13;
network included 134bridges all but2 destroyed during the war. These two bridges, plus one&#13;
reconstructedmeanwhile, were the only ones that could be usedin2002. The reopening of the railway&#13;
between BiC and Luena will be crucial for the restart and sustainability of most activities inthe province.&#13;
Later on, the reopening of the 350 kilometersrailway between Luena and Luau(inthe border with DRC)&#13;
will support the economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Social sectors. The very highlevels ofpopulationmigration due to war has anegative impact inall&#13;
existing statistic data, which vary widely. Additionally, the ongoing return of IDSmakes the situation&#13;
even more fluid and dynamic. Education. In2002 the number of children matriculated inlevels Iand 11&#13;
was around 49,000. The number of children out of the school systemwas estimated at more than 36&#13;
percent (around 30,000). According to the provincial government, 150 schools out of 177 of level Iare&#13;
operating, and 27 mustbe totally reconstructed. Inlevel I,the number of studentsper school is 300 and&#13;
the number of students per teacher is 37. Health. Also according to the provincial government, the health&#13;
infrastructure mustbe extensively rehabilitated(4 out of 6 hospitals, 6 out o f 8 Health Centers, all 31&#13;
HealthPosts inoperation plus 86 that are not operative). The health human resourceso f the province&#13;
were limitedto 5 physicians (64,400 inhabitantdphysician) all of them inLuena, and 543 nurses (85&#13;
percent o f theminthe municipality of Moxico). Agriculture andforests. Fiftyto seventy percent o fthe&#13;
land has potential for livestockproduction and for agriculture, namelyrice, cassava, maize, potato, beans&#13;
and peanuts. Nevertheless, inNovember 2002 the WFP was distributing1,246 MT to 17percent o fthe&#13;
population. The forest has wood ofhighquality that inthe past was usedas raw materialby an industry&#13;
that has been completely paralyzed since many years. Socialpartners. There are 58 NGO's as well as 4&#13;
churches and religious organizations operating inthe province.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure. The situation of transports was described above and it i s critical for any other activity.&#13;
Electricity. Despite the significant hydroelectricpotential of the province, only one small hydraulic&#13;
power plant existed (Luena) butit was destroyed duringthe war and is now beingreconstructed. All the&#13;
electricity i s producedby generators with fuel transported to Luena by air at ahuge cost. The electricity&#13;
supply is limitedto some hours per day andit dependsof fuel availability. The conditionofthe&#13;
distributionnetwork i s quite poor. Fater. InLuenaa mainreservoir was rehabilitatedwith UNICEF&#13;
support and has been functioning since May 2002, supplyingwater to the distribution network. This&#13;
network supplies water to only part of Luenahouseholds and its condition i s very poor with significant&#13;
losses and (it was inoperative during 8 years). Most o fLuena populationis supplied with raw water from&#13;
Luena and Lumegirivers by trucks that charge 6 US$per cubic meter. The Luena and Camenongue&#13;
water supply systems should be rehabilitatedinthe short term. Inall other municipalities new systems&#13;
should be constructed once the old ones are insuch a condition that does not allow rehabilitation. Most&#13;
of the rural populationuses raw water from rivers. Urban. The city o f Luena has serious erosion&#13;
                                                    168&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
problems as well as desertification ones. Additionally its sewerage system i s clogged inseveral portions&#13;
of it andprobably shouldbe replaced. The general conditionofthe infrastructure ofLuena andother&#13;
municipalities is very poor due to lack of maintenance.&#13;

Social sectors. Education. The number of childreninschooling age i s estimated at 506,000 and the&#13;
number o f those out of the school systemi s estimatedas being 60 percent (more than the official number&#13;
of 240,000). There are 1,278 classrooms, of which only some 900 are functioning, although most ofthem&#13;
inprecariousconditions, and380mustberehabilitatedbefore they canbeusedagain. Dueto this&#13;
classrooms situation, 329 classes are functioning withno facility to support them. The number of&#13;
students per classroom is 204 for Level Iand 447 for Level 11. The number of students per teacher i s 33&#13;
for Level Iand 49 for Level II.Health. There are only 100healthfacilities inthe province (39 private&#13;
ones, including 5 hospitals o freligious missions that are not operating due to serious damages or&#13;
destruction). Fromthese one hundredfacilities, 10are hospitals, 13 Health Centers and 77 HealthPosts.&#13;
Ofthose only 50 percent are functioning (4 hospitals, 6 Health Centersand 39 HealthPosts). The human&#13;
resourcesinthe health sector available inthe province are limitedto 12physicians (150,000&#13;
inhabitants/physician), all of them inKuito, and 778 nurses (2,3 15 inhabitants/nurse). The under-five&#13;
mortality rate is estimated at 540 per 1,000 livebirthsand maternal mortality at 1,481/100,000.&#13;
Agriculture. Bik i s known for its highpotentialfor agriculture production and livestock. The traditional&#13;
production included maize, beans, rice, cassava, arabica coffee and vegetables. The potentialfor maize&#13;
production, for instance, i s estimated at more than 400 thousand tons. Most of the institutional&#13;
infrastructures inthe agriculture activity (such as silos, stockhouses) were destroyed as well as tertiary&#13;
roads and feeder roads connecting farms to the mainroadnetwork. Socialpartners. There are 24 NGO's&#13;
operating inthe province as well as 3 churches and religious organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure. Transports. Roads. The roadnetwork must berehabilitated. The rehabilitation should&#13;
include 623 kilometers of primary roads and 413 and 800 o f secondaryand tertiary roads respectively.&#13;
Severalroadbridges were destroyed and mustbereconstructed. Railways. The CFB crosses Bit from&#13;
west to east andthe rail was the maintransport systemfor the commercializationof agriculture products&#13;
towards the coast and towards Moxico and also for the transport ofproducts withinthe province itself. It&#13;
i s estimated that some twenty-two railway bridges were destroyed and must be reconstructed at the same&#13;
time the track is rehabilitated to reopenrailway service. Electricity. The hydropower plantthat existed&#13;
near Kuito was destroyed. Seven generators, with atotal capacity of 3,7 MVA (3,O MVA inKuito) are&#13;
the only source ofelectricity productionina province with 1.8 million inhabitants. Four municipalities&#13;
have no electric power installedand it is estimated that only 2 percent of Kuito populationhas access to&#13;
electricity. Water. InKuito water production was recently reestablished butthe condition of the&#13;
distribution network i s very poor with losses estimated as highas 60 percent. The lack o f electric power&#13;
also has anegative impact inwater production and distribution. Most o f the systems that were installedin&#13;
the other municipalities and rural areas were notmaintainedor destroyed duringthe war. On average, the&#13;
rural populationhas to walk 1kilometers to reachwater once inthe whole province it i s estimated that&#13;
only 115 boreholes or wells are available.&#13;

KUANZA      NORTE   PROVINCE&#13;
&#13;
KuanzaNorte i s located inthe northemregionof Angola. Its area i s of 82,570 kilometers.2 The province&#13;
i s dividedin 10municipalities and 3 1communes, with a total populationestimated at 575,000 and with a&#13;
density o f 6.9 inhabitants/kilometers.2Thepopulationdistribution i s uneven throughout its 10&#13;
municipalities with almost 50 percent of it concentratedinthe three southem ones (Cazengo, Golungo&#13;
Alto and Cambambe). The displaced populationduringthe war was estimated at 85,000. InAugust 2003&#13;
the total number of returned or returningIDSwas estimated at 45,000.&#13;
&#13;
Social sectors. Education. In2002 the number of children matriculated inlevels Iand I1was around&#13;
41,000. The populationinschooling age can be estimated around 175,000, which meansthat probably75&#13;
to 80 percent (134,000) o fthe children inschooling age were out of the system. According to the&#13;
provincial government, the total number of schools was 525 of which 506 for level I,for level 11,6 for&#13;
                                                                                        8&#13;
levels I1and I11and 5 highschools. In2002, 55 percent (292) of these schools were not functioning (283&#13;
for level I, 4 for level 11,3 for levels I1and I11and 2 highschools) mainly due to the condition ofthe&#13;
facilities that, insome cases, were totally destroyed. With few exceptions, most of the schools and&#13;
classrooms should be rehabilitated or reconstructed. Health. Also according to the provincial&#13;
government, only two thirds of healthfacilities were functioning (55 out of 88) in2002. The province&#13;
healthinfrastructure, with 3 hospitals (2 functioning), 14Health Centers (11functioning), 66 HealthPosts&#13;
(39 functioning) and 5 trypanosomiasis dispensaries (3 functioning) should be extensively rehabilitated or&#13;
reconstructed. The provincehealthhumanresources inthe same year were limitedto 10physicians&#13;
(almost 58,000 inhabitantsper physician) and 261nurses (around 2,200 inhabitants per nurse).&#13;
Agriculture and livestockproduction. Traditionally these were the province most important economic&#13;
activities. Maincultures were cassava, maize, beans, peanuts, and fruits. Livestock production was also a&#13;
traditional activity, mainly of cattle, sheep and goats. Withpeace, the cultivated area has increasedbut&#13;
the level of activity is yet very low andmost of it is for self-subsistenceand for local informalmarketing&#13;
due to the limitedaccess to markets. Socialpartners. There are 25 NGO's as well as 4 churchesand&#13;
religious organizations operating inthe province.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure. Transports. Roads. As inall other provinces the roadnetwork i s highlydeteriorated and&#13;
must berehabilitated as a support to all other activities. The primaryroad from Luandato Malange&#13;
crosses the south ofKwanzaNorte, through its capital Ndalatando, and at Lucalaanother primary road&#13;
 starts to the north of the province and to Uige. Theseroads connect three provinces (Kwanza Norte, Uige&#13;
 an Malange) to the mainport of Luanda. Besides this primary roads, rehabilitation o f secondary and&#13;
tertiary roads will be critical to support economic activity, namely agriculture and livestock production.&#13;
Railways. The CFL crosses the province ofKwanza Norte from west to east and, together with the roads&#13;
 for the north (Uige), it was one of the maintransport systems for the commercialization of products to and&#13;
 from the coast. The government started the rehabilitation of the CFL that shouldbereopened inthe short&#13;
term upto Lucala. Electricity. Ndalatando receives electric power from a substation connectedto the&#13;
 Cambambehydroelectric power plant. The same applies to Dondo inthe municipality of Cambambe.&#13;
The electricity distributionnetwork inNdalatando is deteriorated and shouldberehabilitated. The other&#13;
municipalities inthe province hadno electricity. Water. KwanzaNorte has the same type of water&#13;
problems as the other provinces, beingit inurbanwater or inrural water.&#13;

MALANGE       PROVINCE&#13;
&#13;
Malange i s located inthe central northern regiono fAngola inthe border with the DRC. Its area i s of&#13;
82,570 kilometers' and has a highpotentialfor agriculture production. The province i s dividedin 14&#13;
municipalities with two of them (Malange and Kalandula) having around 43 percent of the total&#13;
population. The estimated populationin2002 was of around 890.000 inhabitantswith a density of 10.7&#13;
inhabitantskilometers'.    The percentage of displacedpopulationduringthe war was estimatedat 35&#13;
percent (3 lO,OOO),  percentagethat by the endof 2002 was reducedto 14percent (121,000). InAugust&#13;
2003 the total number ofreturned or returningIDSwas estimatedat some 202,000.&#13;
&#13;
Social sectors. Education. In2002 the number of children matriculated inlevels Iand I1was around&#13;
78,000. The populationinschooling age was estimatedbetween 257,000 and 307,000, which means that&#13;
70 to 75 percent (170,000 to 230,000) ofthe children inschooling age were out ofthe system. The Gross&#13;
Enrollment Rate i s estimated at 27 percent, and inrural areas it falls to 13 percent. According to the&#13;
provincial government, the total numberof functioning classrooms was 733 of which 505 inurban areas&#13;
and only 228 inrural ones. The averagenumber of students per teacher i s 47 buti s raisesto 108 to 288 in&#13;
some municipalities which population is mostly rural (Quirima, Kangandala and Marimba). The large&#13;
majority of schools are located inthe urbanareas (111out of 199) andthe averagenumber of students per&#13;
classroom i s very high(112). The condition of classrooms i s below any acceptable standardsand they&#13;
should berehabilitatedor reconstructed with few exceptions. Health. Also according to the provincial&#13;
government, only 15 healthfacilities out of 146were functioning in2002. The province health&#13;
infrastructure, with 13 hospitals, 36 Health Centers and 97 HealthPosts, should be extensively&#13;
rehabilitated or reconstructed. The province health humanresources inthe same year were limited to 9&#13;
physicians (almost 100,000 inhabitants per physician) and 371nurses (around 2,400 inhabitantsper&#13;
nurse). Agriculture and livestockproduction. Traditionally these were the province most important&#13;
economic activities. Maincultures were cotton(Baixa de Kassanje), tobacco, rice, cassava, maize, beans,&#13;
peanutsand fruits. Livestockproduction was also a traditional activity, mainly of cattle, sheep and goats.&#13;
Withpeace, the cultivatedareahas doubled in2002/2003 comparedwith 200112002, butthe levelof&#13;
activity i s yet very low andmost of it i s for self-subsistenceand for local informal marketingdue to the&#13;
limited access to markets. Socialpartners. There are 20 NGO's as well as 4 churchesand religious&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructures. Transports. One o fthe biggestproblems of the province i s accessibility, being it to the&#13;
province or within it. The war destroyed or severely damagedroadandrailways networks that also&#13;
deteriorated due to lack o fmaintenance. The railway betweenLuandaandMalange (that once provided&#13;
one of the main accesses to the province) i s inoperative with two bridgestotally destroyed and 31&#13;
partially destroyed and tracks inpoor condition. The road network included2,045 kilometers ofprimary&#13;
ones (of which 325 kilometers were asphalted) and 1,073 kilometers and 647 kilometers of secondary and&#13;
tertiary roads respectively. The condition of thisnetwork i s very poor making access to the province&#13;
difficult as well as transport within the province. This situation i s even worse duringthe raining season.&#13;
Electricity. Inthe city o f Malange four generators are the only source of power production but only one&#13;
was operative by the end of 2002. The distribution network inMalange i s more than 50 years old, poorly&#13;
maintained and must be replaced inmost of its length. Inother municipalities there i s no electricity.&#13;
Water. The water production and distributionsystems inMalange are inpoor condition, mainly the last&#13;
one. Inother municipalities the old systems were inoperative in2002. There are ongoing studies for the&#13;
rehabilitation of water systems inthe municipalities of Malange, Cangandala, Lombe, Cacuso.&#13;

     U~GE  PROVINCE&#13;
&#13;
TheprovinceofUige is locatedinthe northernregionofAngola inthe border withthe DRC andits area&#13;
i s of 56,698 lalometers' and with a highpotentialfor agriculture. The province i s divided in 16&#13;
municipalities and 46 communes. The estimatedpopulationin2002 was of around 986,000 inhabitants&#13;
with a density of 17.3 inhabitants/kilometers2. The percentageofdisplacedpopulationduring the war&#13;
was estimated at less than 20 percent (187,000). InAugust 2003 the total numberof returnedor retuming&#13;
IDSwas estimatedat morethan 185,000.&#13;
&#13;
Social sectors. Education. In2002 the number of children matriculated inlevels Iand I1was around&#13;
93,000 and it was estimated that 60 percent ofthe children inschool age were out o f the education&#13;
system. According to the provincial govemment, less than 23 percent of the total number of schools&#13;
(1,045) was functioning in2002 and almost all of those were for level I(225 out of 238). The average&#13;
number o f students per classroomwas 91 for level Iand 349 for level 11. The condition of functioning&#13;
classrooms i s below acceptable standardsand they should berehabilitated or reconstructed with few&#13;
exceptions. The averagenumber of studentsper teacher is 33 raising seriousconcems for the capacity of&#13;
the systemto absorb the majority ofthe childrenout of school. Health. Also according to the provincial&#13;
govemment, only 24 healthfacilities of the previous existing 280 were functioning in2002. The province&#13;
healthinfrastructure, with6 hospitals, 28 HealthCenters, 182HealthPosts and 60 Rural Dispensaries,&#13;
should be extensively rehabilitated or reconstructed. The healthhumanresourcesof the province, inthe&#13;
same year, were limitedto 9 physicians (110,000 inhabitants per physician) and 442 nurses (around 2,200&#13;
inhabitants per nurse). Agriculture andforests. Traditionally these were the province most important&#13;
economic activities. Maincultures were robusta coffee, palmoil, cassava, maize, rice, beans, peanuts,&#13;
vegetables and fruits. The forest has wood of very good quality and an industrywas once functioning&#13;
basedinthis raw material. With peace, the cultivated area has increasedbut the level of activity i s yet&#13;
very low andmost ofiti s for self-subsistenceandfor local informalmarketingdueto the limited access&#13;
to markets. Socialpartners. There are 20 NGO's as well as 4 churches andreligious organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructures. Transports. The war destroyed or severely damagedthe road network that was also&#13;
deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. The roadnetwork had 6,000 kilometers, o f those 4,13 1&#13;
Kilometers (69 percent) should be rehabilitated or reconstructed, including 233 roadbridges. The poor&#13;
 condition of this network results indifficult accessto the province as well as transports within the&#13;
province. This situa~oni s evenworse during the raining season. Electricity. Only the towns o fUige and&#13;
Negage have generatorsto produce electricity, with a total capacity o f 1MVA and 24 KVA respectively.&#13;
 All other municipalitieshave no electric power. Water. There are water productionsystems inUige,&#13;
Negage and inthe mainlocality of Songo. All these systems are functioning but should berehabilitated&#13;
 as well as the distribution networks.&#13;

                           Appendix 12: Summaryof the DeminingAspects&#13;
&#13;
As aresult of almost thirtyyears ofcivilwar, Angola is one ofthe most landmine-contaminated countries&#13;
intheworld. ThesuccessiveAngolan wars, from 1961to 2002, haveleftanestimatedsixto seven&#13;
million landmines scatteredthroughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
Since the first peace accords, inJuly 1991, the government starteddemining activitieswith the support of&#13;
the internationalcommunity. Dueto the restart of war in 1992andlater again in 1998the demining&#13;
activity was not organized ina sustainedway at the national level. The peaceaccord o f April 2002, seen&#13;
as the beginning of a lastingpeace, was a turningpoint inthe deminingactivity that was sharply&#13;
increased. During 2002 and 2003 most of the deminingactivitieswere concentratedon support to the&#13;
reopening roads and to the clearing of areas for populationresettlement. These activities were developed&#13;
not only by the NationalInstitute for removal of landmines and unexploded ordnance(INAROE) but also&#13;
by the Army Engineering servicesandby 7 NGO's and companiesspecialized inlandmines removal. As&#13;
a result, by September2003, more than 7,500 kilometers of roadsand hundredsofresettlement locations&#13;
were cleared, landmine fields registeredandmarked, thus allowing the returnof more than 1,8 millions of&#13;
IDS.Inthe first 7 monthsof2003, morethan2,089 kilometers ofroadand2 millionsquaremetersof&#13;
landhave been cleared; 5,610 antipersonnel mines, 475 antitank mines and 835,762 unexploded ordnance&#13;
have beenremoved. The number of mine incidents and mine victimsrose from 167 and 287 in2002 to&#13;
187 and 307 respectively in2003. Taking inconsideration the increasedmobility o f the populationthese&#13;
numbers indicate that a serious effort has been done to limit incidents and victims and to increasethe&#13;
populationawareness but it also indicates that landmine problems are a significantriskthat will remainin&#13;
the near future.&#13;
&#13;
The government, with the support ofUNDP, decidedto restructure itsmine actionefforts, creating a&#13;
national body responsible for policy and coordinationof demining activities and for providing assistance&#13;
to mine victims and decided also to restructure INAROE,which inthe hturewould be focused in&#13;
operational demining activities. As aresult of these decisions the Inter-Sectoral Committee for Demining&#13;
and HumanitarianAssistance (CNIDAH) was established inJuly 2001 and become active inthe&#13;
beginning of 2003. The Commission, responsible to the Council of Ministers for coordinatingdemining&#13;
activities and providing assistance to mine victims and also will beresponsible for the design of a&#13;
National Mine Action Program. At the Provinciallevel, Vice-Governors will representthe Commission.&#13;
The Commissionhas two sub-commissions, one for demining and a second one for the assistance to mine&#13;
victims. The demining subcommission, headedby the head of INAD (the National Institute for&#13;
 demining) includes all institutionalpartners (such as UNDP, UNICEF, OCHA, andthe ArmedForcesof&#13;
 Angola) as well as organizations specialized indeminingor landmine awareness (international companies&#13;
 as well as international andnationalNGOs, etc.). CNIDAH i s the Angolan entity incharge of&#13;
 accreditation of any organization that intendsto have demining activities inAngola.&#13;
&#13;
 Inthe context ofthe current reformofmine actioninstitutions, aNationalInstitutefor Demining(INDA),&#13;
 focused on the operational demining activities, replaced INAROE - the former mine action coordination&#13;
 body. The seven brigades of INAROE were integrated inINDA and it i s plannedto create eight&#13;
 additional brigades inthe following provinces: Benguela, KwanzaNorte, Huila, Bengo, Zaire, Cabinda,&#13;
 Cunene and Kwanza Sul. Eachbrigadehas a staffo f 67 persons (including support staff). The INAD&#13;
 deminingScholl locatedinLuandawill bealso inchargeofto provide support to the Provincial&#13;
 government of Luanda inany interventionthat mightbe required. Inthe remainingtwo Angolan&#13;
 provinces (Namibe andLundaNorte), with minor incidence of landmine problems, it i s plannedto&#13;
 establish one smaller unit (deminingoperational teams) ineachone of them. INDA i s following the&#13;
 internationalstandardoperation procedures as definedby U N M A S (Geneve), including those relatedto&#13;
 minimize the environment impact duringlandmine andunexploded ordnance clearance. INAD can&#13;
 provide landmine clearancecertificationor to prepare a deminingplan for an area that requires this type&#13;
 o f intervention. INAD strongly recommends that, duringthe planningphase of aninvestment, the entity&#13;
 inchargeofitmustcontact the Instituteto h o wtheir assessmentonsite landmine issues. This&#13;
                                                     174&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendation should be implementedas soon as the investment site location, its accesses as well as&#13;
any additional areas to be requiredduringthe construction works (such as, width o froads margins to be&#13;
used duringconstruction or to provide traffic deviation) are identified. All entities involved inthe&#13;
implementationof EMRP shall comply withthis recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
According to INAD,the provinces includedinthe Project with higher incidence of landmine problems are&#13;
Bie(withhighdensityoflandminesinsome sites suchasKuito surroundings anditsmainaccessroads)&#13;
and Malange. Uige and Moxico have also significant incidence of landmine and unexploded ordnance,&#13;
although at a somehow lower level than those two. Kwanza Sul i s least affected than any ofthe others,&#13;
except Luanda province.&#13;
&#13;
Although the Council o fMinisters has approvedthe DeminingProgramfor 2003-04 with abudget of&#13;
US$9,3 millions, INAD has only received a small part of this budget and the full implementation of its&#13;
programhas been delayed due to this reason. The Angolan Armed Forces also received funds to reinforce&#13;
their activity inthis field.&#13;
&#13;
The international community provided strong support to the govemment, namely throughUNAgencies.&#13;
This support allowedthe financing ofthe following projects: (i) ANG/02/008, "Support to the&#13;
                                                                UNDP&#13;

            Program (Phase 1) Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Angola
            Emergency Multisector Recovery Program Project, (EMRP), to
            be implemented in two phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2), is to
            help build the foundation for long- term reconstruction,
            economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment of state
            administration throughout the country. The specific
            objectives of the program are to assist the government to
            (a) improve rural incomes and enhance food security in the
            provinces most affected by the conflict, (b) improve access
            to essential education and health services in the provinces
            most affected by the conflict, (c) reconstruct and
            rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (d) strengthen
            capacity of government at all levels toformulate, prepare,
            implement, and manage medium and long-term development
            programs. Phase 1 includes activities to prepare Phase 2;
            Phase 2 contains actions to prepare follow-on sectoral
            projects to meet the needs of the country during its
            development phase. The program comprises four components:
            (a) rural development and delivery of social services; (b)
            rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure
            (roads and bridges, electricity, water supply, and urban
            infrastructure); (c) capacity building, institutional
            strengthening and development of sector strategies; and (d)
            management and monitoring of the program and project, and
            preparation of the next steps.
