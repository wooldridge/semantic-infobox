Abstract&#13;
This paper specifies and estimates for three developing&#13;
countries  two  intertemporal   models  of  total  imports.    Imports  are&#13;
related alternatively to foreign exchange receipts and to GNP, with&#13;
explicit account taken of expectations about the future values of these&#13;
variables,  future import prices and interest rates.      Using non-nested&#13;
hypothesis tests, the models are compared between themselves and with&#13;
two other models of imports in the literature.       While the results are&#13;
not entirely satisfactory, they suggest that the intertemporal approach&#13;
is quite   promising.    As  this  attempt  is  the first to estimate an&#13;
intertemporal model of international trade, considerable space is&#13;
devoted to the operational specification of the theoretical models.&#13;
&#13;

In preparing this paper I benefitted considerably from comments&#13;
on an earlier draft by participants at the International Economics&#13;
Seminar at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies,&#13;
and by Professors Jonathan Eaton, James Riedel and Robert Stern.      Kathi&#13;
Yu also helped in its preparation, both through discussions and first-&#13;
rate research assistance. Karen Adams, Jean Epps and Vicky Sugui shared&#13;
the unreasonable burden of typing several drafts, and Whitney Watriss&#13;
edited  the  final  text.     I am most   grateful   to all  these  people.&#13;
Naturally, none of them is to be implicated in the paper's remaining&#13;
shortcomings.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The recession of the early 1980s hit developing countries in&#13;
two ways.   First, the markets for their exports were depressed and were&#13;
frequently restricted by protectionism. Second, real rates of interest&#13;
rose to unprecedentedly high levels.    The latter perhaps constitutes the&#13;
unique aspect of the recent experience and should in particular be&#13;
contrasted with the experience of the mid-seventies, when interest rates&#13;
were  low and   borrowing   plentiful.    Then,  despite  depressed   export&#13;
revenues, developing countries were able to maintain fairly high rates&#13;
of domestic growth    by extensive   foreign borrowing.     This borrowing&#13;
allowed them to maintain their demand for imported goods from the OECD&#13;
and contributed to the recovery of world economic activity in 1977-78.&#13;
It also, however, sowed the seeds of the present difficulties,&#13;
for many developing countries became heavily indebted.      Hence, when the&#13;
real interest rate rose in 1980, they found their capacity to service&#13;
their loans severely stretched.       This situation was    reflected in a&#13;
reduced demand for imports, which lowered the growth of industrial&#13;
countries'  export growth and prolonged their depression.        The mutual&#13;
reinforcement  of depressed markets and declining      lending   turned  the&#13;
early 1980s into one of the most extended depressions of recent&#13;
history.   These same conditions continue to raise questions about the&#13;
extent and durability of the current recovery.&#13;
While it is certain that the amount of debt, rising interest&#13;
rates and falling export revenues have curtailed developing countries'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
imports, there has been little formal econometric work devoted to&#13;
quantifying the effects or even to specifying the precise mechanism.&#13;
This paper explores certain aspects of how the situation can be modelled&#13;
and presents a very simple and highly specialized estimation model. The&#13;
starting point is that developing countries' decisions to borrow and to&#13;
import are made jointly: one decision does not completely dominate the&#13;
other.   Thus our model assumes neither that imports are determined as&#13;
the sum of exogenously given exports and net borrowing, nor that&#13;
borrowing is determined by the difference between exogenously given&#13;
exports and imports.&#13;
The basic framework comprises a balance of payments identity&#13;
and a behavioral sector that explains borrowing and importing.           The&#13;
former is:&#13;
X + M + N + F =O                                             (1.1)&#13;
where X   = The value of exports of goods and non-factor services&#13;
M  =  The value of imports of goods and services&#13;
N  =  Net factor payments and&#13;
F  =  Net borrowing, including changes in foreign exchange&#13;
reserves.&#13;
The behavioral component is:&#13;
M = M (X,N,Z)                                               (1.2a)&#13;
F = F (X,N,Z)                                               (1.2b)&#13;
where Z = A vector of exogenous variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-.&#13;
Given exports and factor payments, the balance of payments&#13;
constraint ensures that only one of (1.2a) and (1.2b) is independent.&#13;
Thus,  it is necessary to estimate only one.        However, the variables&#13;
relating to "borrowing," such as the interest rate, will still enter the&#13;
import equation, and vice-versa. The reason is that since X + N, then&#13;
am  -  aF.    As our interest here is in imports, we focus on (1.2a).&#13;
(This approach assumes that the errors and omissions in the balance of&#13;
payments account are not important. If they were, it might be desirable&#13;
to estimate both [1.2a] and [1.2b], essentially dropping [1.11 from the&#13;
system.)&#13;
Because our purpose is mainly exploratory, we concentrate below&#13;
on the relationship between imports and the borrowing variables.         Our&#13;
aim is to produce a simple equation that links import behavior to the&#13;
borrowing variables   in a theoretically clear manner.       Simplicity is&#13;
important, because ultimately our intention is to estimate the model for&#13;
many developing countries, with a view to making global projections.&#13;
The paper starts with a survey of existing models of import&#13;
behavior and borrowing (Section II). This review is followed in Section&#13;
III by a discussion of the various lessons that may be drawn from&#13;
previous efforts.    Next we specify our own models in some detail.       We&#13;
explore two basic versions -- one that is based solely on foreign&#13;
exchange considerations (Section IV), the other taking into account&#13;
domestic factors as well (Section V) -- and we distinguish between pure&#13;
equilibrium models and models embodying some degree of disequilibrium.&#13;
To our knowledge, this effort is the first empirical implementation of&#13;
models of the kind we are using.     Thus we devote considerable space    to&#13;
the concept and to the measurement of the variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
In the subsequent four sections, the models are estimated for&#13;
three developing countries chosen at random. Section VI is devoted to a&#13;
general test of the specification of the wealth model based on foreign&#13;
exchange  earnings.    It  treats  the three   countries  merely  as   three&#13;
examples of the same process and considers, first, whether certain&#13;
necessary implications of the model are empirically valid and, second,&#13;
which of several approaches to measuring wealth seems best. In general,&#13;
the implications are satisfied, so that in the next section, VII, the&#13;
basic model is estimated and simplified for each country separately.&#13;
The results suggest a fairly high degree of intertemporal substitution&#13;
for imports. Section VIII is devoted to estimating three other models&#13;
- the wealth model based on domestic flows, and two simple models from&#13;
the literature against which to test the new models.        The results of&#13;
this effort are mixed -- the new model shows some capacity to explain&#13;
imports, but is matched or surpassed by one of the strawmen.&#13;
In the final section, X, conclusions are drawn about directions&#13;
for future research.&#13;
The heart of the paper is Section IV, in which we describe our&#13;
models, and Sections VI to IX, where we test them.         Readers familiar&#13;
with (or uninterested in) previous attempts to model imports and&#13;
financial conditions could start with these sections, referring back&#13;
only where they require the justification for certain procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. MODELS IN THE LITERATURE&#13;
Two broad approaches to the question of developing countries'&#13;
imports and financial variables may be identified.      The first looks at&#13;
the allocation of a given amount of foreign exchange between imports and&#13;
increments to reserves:    reserves are assumed to be desirable for some&#13;
intertemporal   reason,   although   this   assumption   does   not  figure&#13;
prominently   in  the   specification.     The  second   approach  is  more&#13;
explicitly intertemporal:    it treats the current account of the balance&#13;
of payments as an investment flow, arguing that it is primarily&#13;
determined by the desire to reschedule absorption relative to income.&#13;
This section briefly considers the research on these two approaches.&#13;
Imports and Reserves&#13;
The clearest exposition of the relationship between imports and&#13;
foreign exchange reserves in developing countries is Hemphill (1974).&#13;
Hemphill  supposes   that  a country has   an exogenously given     flow of&#13;
foreign exchange earnings in each year, Ft, and that this flow must be&#13;
allocated between expenditures on imports, Mt, and additions to reserves&#13;
ARt.   He  assumes   that  long-run   imports,  M*,  must   equal  long-run&#13;
receipts, F*, and that there is a long-run desired stock of reserves,&#13;
R*,  that  is  also  related  to receipts.     The allocation    of  foreign&#13;
exchange is then made to minimize the costs (assumed to be quadratic) of&#13;
the deviations of actual reserves and imports from their desired (or&#13;
long-run) levels. The basic estimating equation is:&#13;
M  = aO + aRt-    + a2Ft +3 AFt                             (2.1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
where AF   occurs as part of the assumed function for F*.    In fact, since&#13;
data on Hemphill's definition of reserves are not available, Rt _ 1 has&#13;
to be replaced by a cumulative term in AR,       but this changes nothing&#13;
fundamental.&#13;
Hemphill's research is meticulous, and he makes many important&#13;
detailed methodological observations.      While we do not repeat all of&#13;
them  here,  certain  basic   points  should  be made.     First,  Hemphill&#13;
experiments with several different definitions of reserves, shifting&#13;
items in the balance of payment accounts from the exogenous component,&#13;
F, to the endogenous one, AR. Thus this approach can be adopted to deal&#13;
with borrowing and debt. Furthermore, Hemphill shows that, provided the&#13;
costs of disequilibrium are quadratic in the differences between actual&#13;
and desired magnitudes, countries can have targets for different&#13;
components of R without changing the form of the equation (2.1).       This&#13;
claim amounts to an assumption of separability between imports and the&#13;
structure  of   their  (net)  finance  (F  - R).     In other   words,   the&#13;
propensity to spend cash on imports does not depend on whether that cash&#13;
is owned (reserves) or borrowed.&#13;
Second, Hemphill's model assumes constant parameters for the&#13;
cost function.    That is, the costs of excessive reserves or excessive&#13;
borrowing are assumed    to be constant over the sample period.         This&#13;
assumption may have been a good approximation for his pre-1970 sample,&#13;
but it certainly requires reconsideration in later years.&#13;
A third important feature of Hemphill's approach is that only&#13;
financial variables explain imports.     The traditional variables such as&#13;
income and relative prices are excluded, as are any policy variables.&#13;
The logic behind this approach is simple and compelling.        Ultimately,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
with inflows of F*, outflows, M*, must be at the same level.            Some&#13;
rescheduling is possible via AR, but the long-run budget constraint must&#13;
eventually be binding:    regardless of income and prices, and regardless&#13;
of whether imports are limited to F* by market means or by rationing,&#13;
ultimately M* = F*.      Thus Hemphill conceives the developing country&#13;
economy as a single decision unit, with no restraints on its ability to&#13;
minimize  the costs of disequilibrium.       To this concept he adds his&#13;
assumption of the constant costs of disequilibrium. The result is that&#13;
imports depend only on financial variables.&#13;
Later research on imports and reserves has relaxed this aspect&#13;
of Hemphill's work.    Sundararajan (1983) supposes that desired imports&#13;
are determined by a traditional import function, including relative&#13;
prices, (PM/p), income, Y, real balances, EM, and policy variables, and&#13;
that permitted imports balance these against the need to maintain&#13;
reserves.      He  does   not,   however,   impose   the   long-run  budget&#13;
constraint. His basic equation is&#13;
Mt =a    +    (P )t   a2 Yt + a3 EMt + a4Ft + a5 R    _,      (2.2)&#13;
which is broadly Hemphill's plus some extra terms.&#13;
While Sundararajan does not rationalize it in this way, this&#13;
approach is similar to allowing the costs of imports deviating from&#13;
desired imports to vary in Hemphill's model.        In the latter, if the&#13;
costs of constraining imports go up with income and rising domestic&#13;
prices, an equation similar to Sundararajan's would emerge.        Chu, Hwa&#13;
and Krishnamurty (1983) adopt a similiar approach to Sundarajan's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Intertemporal Allocation&#13;
As noted already, the intertemporal nature of Hemphill's model&#13;
is implicit but not prominent.     This condition is rectified -    but not&#13;
without cost -- in the second approach to the determination of imports&#13;
-- namely, the intertemporal allocation models.     These models sprang to&#13;
prominence with Sachs (1981), who argued that the current account&#13;
deficits of the seventies owed more to changes in the incentives for&#13;
investment and savings than to the direct effects of paying more for&#13;
oil. Sachs used a simple two-period model to show how the responses to&#13;
economic shocks would vary according to perceptions of the future.        In&#13;
particular, he showed that whereas an oil-importing country might meet a&#13;
temporary rise in the price of oil by borrowing (running a current&#13;
account deficit), there was little presumption it would do so for price&#13;
rises thought to be permanent.    In the first instance, the country would&#13;
feel that its wealth, and hence its sustainable level of consumption,&#13;
was little changed by the temporary shock.          Thus it would tend to&#13;
maintain consumption levels over the temporary setback by borrowing,&#13;
relying on a lower price in the future to allow repayment of the debt.&#13;
In the case of a permanent oil price rise, however, wealth and permanent&#13;
consumption would fall pari passu with net income.       With no relaxation&#13;
in sight, the incentive would be to cut spending back to equal income as&#13;
soon as possible.     Thus, in this case, the current account would be&#13;
negative only during the adjustment period.&#13;
The essence of the intertemporal model of imports lies in this&#13;
simple model.     Consumption depends on wealth -- which includes        the&#13;
present value of all future income -- and on the rate of transformation&#13;
of present into future consumption.     The latter involves both the rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
of interest and expectations about future prices; the comparison of&#13;
these with the (unknown) rate of time preference determines whether&#13;
consumption is to be shifted forward or backward in time relative to&#13;
income.&#13;
Sachs  (1982)  develops  this  model  further.    He defines the&#13;
"perpetuity" value of any variable, Xp, as that perpetuity that has the&#13;
same present value as the actual stream of the variable, X. Thus,&#13;
XP tf  e-r* (y - t)dy   =tf   e-r* (y - t)X    d              (2.3)&#13;
where     r  =  The rate of interest and&#13;
X(y) =   The value of X in period y.&#13;
Then, writing the trade balance, TB, as output, Q, less private and&#13;
government consumption, C and G, Sachs has:&#13;
TB = Q - C - G&#13;
and&#13;
P    P   P    P&#13;
TB  = Q - C - G.                                             (2.4)&#13;
(Including investment would, in Sachs' words, "enormously complicate the&#13;
algebra.")&#13;
The intertemporal budget constraint means that the present&#13;
value of all future trade deficits must equal current net foreign&#13;
assets, B.   That is, future trade can only be permanently unbalanced to&#13;
the extent that we now have the assets to finance it.          Hence TBP =&#13;
-r*B. Furthermore, since the present current account, CA, equals (TB +&#13;
r*B), we have, from equation (2.4),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
CA = TB - TBP = (Q - Q ) - (C - Cp) - (G - GP).              (2.5)&#13;
Thus the current account is merely the sum of the differences between&#13;
the actual and perpetual values of output and consumption.&#13;
Equation (2.5) may be made operational in a number of ways.&#13;
Sachs does not discuss government spending, G , further, but perpetual&#13;
(permanent) private consumption, CP, is, as above, a function of&#13;
wealth.    It is   the integral of future private      income plus current&#13;
assets. Thus in period 0,&#13;
CD&#13;
W(O) = B(O) + f e r Y[Q(y) - G(y)Idy                         (2.6)&#13;
0&#13;
= B(O) + [Q p(0) - GP(0)I/r*   .                        (2.7)&#13;
However, from the intertemporal budget constraint,&#13;
CP(O) = r*B(O) + Q p(0) - GP(O) = r*W(O)    ,                (2.8)&#13;
which merely states that perpetual consumption can just be financed from&#13;
the returns to wealth.      Note that wealth includes all financial and&#13;
human wealth (and, if it were recognized, physical wealth).&#13;
Current consumption, C, differs from perpetual consumption&#13;
according to the incentives to switch consumption between periods.&#13;
Adopting a particularly simple intertemporal utility function, Sachs&#13;
expresses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
c -    =(d - r*)W,                                          (2.9)&#13;
where 6 is the rate of time preference.&#13;
Sach's model contains    two goods, both traded.     The imported&#13;
good has a fixed price in terms of world currency (the numeraire), while&#13;
the other, which is exported, faces a downward sloping demand curve.&#13;
Its price is thus endogenous and must be substituted out of equation&#13;
(2.5) by relating export demand to world trade, T, and overall supply to&#13;
the labor force,    L, and  productivity,   R.   Thus,  the final equation&#13;
contains no explicit relative price terms.&#13;
Hence, in period 0, the current account may be written as&#13;
CA = (r* - 6)W + a1(G - G ) + a2(T - T9) + a3(R - Re),       (2.10)&#13;
where all variables are measured for period 0.         Imports are clearly&#13;
derivable from this equation, once we have decided how to calculate the&#13;
perpetual values. We shall return to this point below.&#13;
In a model similar to Sachs', Dornbusch (1983) considers the&#13;
case  of traded   and non-traded goods.      Strictly,  he  considers   four&#13;
different prices:     current and future import prices and current and&#13;
future domestic prices.    Imports are stimulated if their current price&#13;
falls relative to either current domestic prices or any future prices.&#13;
Dornbusch deals with discrete time rather than continuous time, and&#13;
derives conditions for the change in planned consumption between two&#13;
periods. Given stationary output,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
d log C = a [r* - 6 + a 2dlogPI,                           (2.11)&#13;
where a1 depends on the degree of intertemporal substitution and a2 on&#13;
the degree of contemporaneous substitution between domestic and foreign&#13;
goods, and where P is the price of imports in terms of home goods.&#13;
Dornbusch does not explicitly recognize future import prices in money&#13;
terms because he uses traded goods rather than money as his numeraire.&#13;
Thus assets represent claims on future traded goods rather than claims&#13;
on money.   This approach is easily adapted to Sach's nominal framework,&#13;
however, by treating r* as the real rate of interest in terms of&#13;
imports.&#13;
Both Sachs and Dornbusch assume that a country can borrow or&#13;
lend unlimited amounts at an exogenously given rate of interest that is&#13;
expected to remain constant forevermore. They further assume a constant&#13;
rate of time preference.      This condition potentially leads    to some&#13;
difficulty with the intertemporal budget constraint, for it appears to&#13;
allow the possibility of indefinite accumulation or decumulation of&#13;
assets  if  r*  # 6.   Two  alternatives   are  available:    first,  that&#13;
imperfect  capital markets impose rising interest rates as borrowing&#13;
increases, and, second, that the rate of time preference is an&#13;
increasing function of instantaneous utility. This latter option serves&#13;
to  bring  consumption  forward   in  time  as wealth   accumulates,  thus&#13;
stabilizing the system.    Both these approaches are adopted by Obstfeld&#13;
(1982), but since neither utility nor the time preference is observable,&#13;
the latter case does not look like a promising avenue for empirical&#13;
research.  The former, however, is potentially more promising and could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
be either tacked onto our present model or used to close a model based&#13;
on optimal growth paths and borrowing.      (Both these alternatives are&#13;
held to a later occasion.)&#13;
The models surveyed in this subsection are theoretically more&#13;
appealing than the import/reserve models treated previously.      However,&#13;
making the intertemporal nature of the import decision explicit vastly&#13;
complicates the model's empirical application.      Sachs (1981) produced&#13;
some simple statistics to support his basic hypothesis, but these did&#13;
not constitute a proper test, and later research has, to our knowledge,&#13;
yielded no empirical work at all.        The reason is the difficulties&#13;
involved   in   operationally   capturing   expectations   and  thus,   in&#13;
particular, in measuring wealth.    These problems will be quite evident&#13;
when we move to our own estimation.&#13;

III. SOME EMPIRICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM&#13;
The literature offers a choice between a theoretically ad hoc&#13;
but easily applicable model and a theoretically complete but almost&#13;
totally inapplicable model.    The intention of this paper is to bridge&#13;
that   gap   by   producing   an   estimable   yet   theoretically   sound&#13;
alternative.    We do   so primarily   by trying   to operationalize   the&#13;
intertemporal models of Sachs and Dornbusch.    However, in the course of&#13;
developing our alternative, we found that many restrictive assumptions&#13;
were necessary to render the system tractable.        These are specified&#13;
clearly   below.     Some   consideration   should  be   given   to  their&#13;
acceptability, even independently of how well the equations happen to&#13;
fit.&#13;
This section contains various observations about the models&#13;
surveyed in the previous section, in terms of both their theoretical and&#13;
empirical  (data-based)   specifications.    It  also  discusses  how the&#13;
various features should influence the specification of our own models.&#13;
The issues covered include the way in which shocks (mistaken plans)&#13;
affect importing, the special assumptions adopted for the capital&#13;
markets, the specification of the utility function, the significance of&#13;
domestic factors in the import decision, and the incorporation of&#13;
investment into the system.&#13;
Plans and Mistakes&#13;
The intertemporal models solve simultaneously for the whole&#13;
time profile of consumption, given the information and expectations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
available at a particular time (say, year 0). However, ignoring forward&#13;
purchases, only year O's expenditures are actually made at the time of&#13;
calculation; the plans for later years remain only plans.       Indeed, by&#13;
year 1, it is likely that new information and expectations will have&#13;
become available and that the plan will need revising.     We could model&#13;
the revisions explicitly, but it is easier just to view the plan devised&#13;
in year 1 as an entirely new project that determines actual expenditures&#13;
in year 1, and so on with new plans for years 2, 3....           Thus our&#13;
empirical estimates concern the first year's expenditures in each of a&#13;
series  of  plans,   rather  than  a  series  of  more   than  one  year's&#13;
expenditures from only one plan.&#13;
In this string of first years, if year 1 turns out exactly as&#13;
anticipated in year 0, expenditures in year 1 will be the same under&#13;
both plan 0 and plan 1. Furthermore, there will be no regrets in year 1&#13;
about what was done in year 0.    If, on the other hand, year 1 contains&#13;
some surprises, year l's expenditures will be revised from those&#13;
intended for it in plan 0, and there will most likely be regrets about&#13;
what was actually done in year 0. That is to say, agents will feel that&#13;
had they known in year 0 what they know now in year 1, they would have&#13;
behaved differently   in year 0.     Thus,  in retrospect,   mistakes  are&#13;
possible, and they make themselves felt through their effect on the&#13;
wealth carried forward from one year to the next.&#13;
If, for example, the actual interest rate on variable rate&#13;
loans in year 1 were higher than had been expected for that year in year&#13;
0, developing country policy-makers may well regret that they imported&#13;
and borrowed so much in year 0.     They will revise consumption (import)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
plans for year 1 downwards relative to those in plan 0, first because&#13;
current   consumption   is  rendered   more   costly  relative   to  future&#13;
consumption by the rise in the interest rate, and second because the&#13;
debt overhang now has to be serviced at a higher rate than expected, a&#13;
situation that reduces real wealth.&#13;
The Market for Loans&#13;
The models discussed earlier assume that developing countries&#13;
can borrow or lend unlimited amounts at exogenously given rates of&#13;
interest. Three dimensions of this assumption deserve comment.&#13;
First, if the rates of interest for borrowing and lending were&#13;
still   exogenous   but  were   different,   the  budget-set   of  feasible&#13;
consumption points would be kinked.     Thus, whereas a unit reduction in&#13;
present consumption would allow an increase of (1 + rL) units next year,&#13;
a unit increase this year would cost (1 + rB) units next year, where (rB&#13;
&gt; rL.) This situation would considerably complicate both the analytics&#13;
and the empirics, giving rise to discontinuities in importing and&#13;
borrowing behavior, without adding much insight to the model.       Ignoring&#13;
it may, of course, substantially bias the model, but we do not expect it&#13;
to do so. A further and sounder reason for ignoring the problem is that&#13;
in fact most developing countries do little lending.         Thus, provided&#13;
that developing countries would still not lend much, even if the&#13;
borrowing and lending rates were equal, the borrowing rate is the&#13;
relevant one for our purposes.&#13;
The second dimension of the borrowing/lending question is the&#13;
exogeneity of the interest rate.      We might expect that as a country's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
indebtedness rose, so too would its risk premium and hence its borrowing&#13;
rate of interest.     The evidence for this pattern is, in fact, rather&#13;
weak (see Riedel, 1983, and MacDonald, 1983).     It could be incorporated&#13;
into our model by introducing an additional (simultaneous) equation for&#13;
the supply of credit.     However, we will ignore this complication for&#13;
now.&#13;
The third aspect of the borrowing/lending nexus also concerns&#13;
the supply curve of credit.      Bankers tend to argue that they ration&#13;
credit quantitatively rather than through price (interest rates). Hence&#13;
developing countries may face a constant rate of interest up to some&#13;
level of borrowing, and thereafter a complete stop in borrowing.&#13;
However, the evidence that these constraints are frequently or widely&#13;
binding is also relatively weak (see Riedel, 1983).        Nevertheless, we&#13;
can hardly argue that credit limits were never applied in 1983, and so&#13;
this problem must be addressed seriously.&#13;
Theoretically we could construct a regime-switching model, with&#13;
separate equations for the periods of constrained and unconstrained&#13;
borrowing.    A priori,   however, we do not expect to have sufficient&#13;
observations on the former to identify it correctly, and there is,&#13;
besides, little guidance on how lending constraints are determined.&#13;
Further, if the constraint is only on current borrowing, and if we treat&#13;
running down the reserves as net borrowing, then the import function&#13;
under the constraint becomes particularly simple and uninteresting in&#13;
its own right: 1/&#13;
1/ The intertemporal allocation becomes more complex if the constraint,&#13;
or expected constraints, affect future years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
M = X +F,&#13;
where F = The constrained level of borrowing.&#13;
Hence, at least in this first attempt, we estimate only the&#13;
"unconstrained"  import  function,   although  we  are  prepared  to omit&#13;
observations where strong evidence of borrowing constraints exists.&#13;
This approach is of interest, first, to see if constraints are actually&#13;
necessary in explaining recent import behavior and, second, even if they&#13;
are, to define what imports would rise to if the constraints were&#13;
relaxed.  After examining our results, it is clear that there is plenty&#13;
of scope for plenty of future research in this area.&#13;
Utility Functions&#13;
Both Sachs and Dornbusch assume utility maximization over an&#13;
infinite time horizon. The general utility function is of the form&#13;
Go&#13;
V      I (1 + d)1iU(Ci) ,                                  (3.1)&#13;
i = O&#13;
where V   =  Total utility&#13;
U   =  "Instantaneous" utility and&#13;
Ci  =  Consumption in year i.&#13;
Note that the function U() does not change over time and that V         is&#13;
additively separable in U(Ci).    The latter severely limits the pattern&#13;
of intertemporal substitution and means that the composition of any&#13;
year's  consumption  bundle  is  independent  of  any  other's,  once  the&#13;
overall levels of consumption have been determined.         The degree of&#13;
intertemporal  substitution   is  determined  by  the  curvature  of Uo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
Basically, the more sensitive utility is to declines in consumption, the&#13;
greater will be the substitution that will occur between years in order&#13;
to smooth away the potential costs.&#13;
To be specific, Sachs assumes&#13;
V    f e 6t log (C ) dt                                     (3.2)&#13;
0             t&#13;
and Dornbusch&#13;
Go&#13;
V =    i (1 + 6)    l     C0      '                         (3.3)&#13;
where, in both cases, Ct is a Cobb-Douglas function of the consumption&#13;
of the various goods consumed in t, for example,&#13;
C  = C   a C  (1 -a)                                        (34)&#13;
t    Tt    Nt&#13;
where CT   =  The consumption of traded goods and&#13;
CN  =  The consumption of non-traded goods.&#13;
The separability of V allows consumption to be determined in&#13;
two steps -    first total consumption, Ct, as a function of wealth and&#13;
annual price indices and, second, disaggregated consumption, CTt, and&#13;
CNt as functions of Ct and contemporary prices.&#13;
The   separability   assumption   is  probably   too   strong  for&#13;
reality.   For example, it does not permit the option of consuming, say,&#13;
a world tour this year rather than next, because next year's composition&#13;
of  consumption   is  independent  of   this  year's.    Nevertheless,   its&#13;
practical attractions are such that we shall adopt it.      The simple form&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
of Ct is useful in rendering the price index for total consumption a&#13;
simple function of PTt and PNt, as well as in easing various algebraic&#13;
manipulations.     This   paper  is   not  concerned  with   disaggregated&#13;
consumption, so the issue is postponed, although there are good reasons&#13;
for believing that equation (3.4) is far too restrictive (Winters,&#13;
1984).&#13;
The Role of Internal Factors&#13;
An important difference between Hemphill's and every other&#13;
study is that Hemphill derives imports solely from "foreign" variables,&#13;
that is, variables relating directly to foreign transactions.         This&#13;
approach arises from his view that, ultimately, the only determinant of&#13;
what can be spent on imports is the foreign exchange generated by&#13;
exports. Thus, for example, whether imports are relatively cheap or are&#13;
urgently needed for domestic growth, or are strongly desired because&#13;
wealth has increased, are not, in his scheme, fundamentally important.&#13;
It is as if the whole economy were a black box: the input of foreign&#13;
exchange from exports and the output for imports must be balanced in the&#13;
long run, and what goes on inside the box is really not very&#13;
significant.&#13;
We could perhaps envision a utility function separable between&#13;
domestic output and imports; given a budget constraint for imports,&#13;
domestic variables do not affect the import stream.     However, this view&#13;
is clearly very extreme, for even within an entirely foreign-determined&#13;
long-run budget, we might expect domestic factors to influence the&#13;
timing  of   imports.     Nonetheless,   it  is  sufficiently   attractive&#13;
empirically to make it worth exploring. Its empirical attraction is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
smallness of its parameter set and data requirements. In particular, it&#13;
might be easier to measure foreign wealth, namely, foreign assets plus&#13;
the present value of future foreign exchange earnings, than total&#13;
wealth, namely, total assets plus the present value of future income.&#13;
Investment&#13;
As Sachs states, investment greatly complicates the analysis of&#13;
an intertemporal model, for it both represents a demand and feeds back&#13;
into wealth.     The simplest procedure practically is to assume that&#13;
consumption and investment can be aggregated into a single composite&#13;
good (absorption) by virtue of having a constant relative price.        This&#13;
procedure in turn assumes that the marginal productivity of investment&#13;
(in terms of present value) and the rate of time preference bear a&#13;
constant relationship to each other. Further, if the aggregate is to be&#13;
the sum of consumption and investment (namely, absorption), the constant&#13;
relationship must be equality. Thus, a unit of consumption in year 0 is&#13;
worth (1 + 6)    in  year  1 because   people  are  impatient;   a unit   of&#13;
investment in year 0 is worth (1 + 6) of consumption in year 1 because&#13;
it actually produces a stream of output that would buy (1 + 6) in year&#13;
1. This condition is the Keynes-Ramsey rule for optimal growth paths,&#13;
and it implies that consumption and investment are in perfect&#13;
equilibrium. We adopt this subterfuge in constructing our basic models,&#13;
but relax it crudely when we examine the disequilibrium forms (pages 27-&#13;
28).&#13;
&#13;

IV. A FOREIGN MODEL OF IMPORTS&#13;
Having discussed various practical and empirical points in the&#13;
previous section, we are now in a position to outline our own models.&#13;
These are exploratory and are therefore fairly general, and particular&#13;
emphasis is laid on exploring issues of specification.      Unfortunately,&#13;
many of the models we discuss are not nested, and since they are often&#13;
rather similar and we have so very few observations, we do not conduct&#13;
many formal non-nested tests.    A certain "ad hocery" will therefore be&#13;
evident.&#13;
The Foreign Wealth Model&#13;
We start with the simpler of the two models -- the foreign&#13;
wealth one.   It follows Hemphill's rationale and concentrates entirely&#13;
on foreign variables.    We assume a country in which the optimal time&#13;
pattern of imports is independent of any domestic variable, which faces&#13;
given import prices, and which has exogenous export receipts (strictly&#13;
current account credits). In the long run, all imports must be paid for&#13;
in foreign exchange derived from current credits.     Thus, given initial&#13;
assets,  these credits define the budget constraint.       The country is&#13;
assumed to face a common exogenous rate of interest for borrowing and&#13;
lending and to be able to borrow or lend unlimited funds at that rate.&#13;
Borrowing and assets are seen merely as the means of transferring import&#13;
consumption over time.&#13;
Assuming that the import sub-utility is quite separable from&#13;
domestic factors and that the allocation of imports over types of goods&#13;
permits two-stage budgetting, we can write:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
co~~~.&#13;
V = [   E     HiMi      '                                    (4.1)&#13;
i = O&#13;
where    V = Total "import utility"&#13;
6 = The rate of time preference relating consumption in period i&#13;
to that in period 0,&#13;
Mi = Aggregate imports in period i in quantity terms and&#13;
y = A parameter determining the degree of intertemporal&#13;
substitution.&#13;
The budget constraint that all imports must eventually be paid for is&#13;
co                   00&#13;
Pip, Mi = A0 +    X  pipi xi                           (4.2)&#13;
where&#13;
p   = The export prices for year i,&#13;
i&#13;
'-M&#13;
p   = The import prices for year i&#13;
i&#13;
Xi = Exports for year i and&#13;
Pi= The discount factor between years i and 0.&#13;
Thus&#13;
Pi = (1 + ro)1 (1 + r 1) .... (1 + ri - 1)1       ,              (4.3)&#13;
and&#13;
pO = 1&#13;
where rj = The interest rate for year J.&#13;
In year 0, all variables with (i &gt; 0) are unknown; they are necessarily&#13;
the subject of expectations, to be discussed shortly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
If we define present value prices (for year 0) as&#13;
Pi    pi                                                       (44)&#13;
then equation (3.2) becomes,&#13;
M                   X&#13;
i  p      OI HPi Xi =W                                      (4.5)&#13;
i  0             i0 ~0&#13;
which, combined with equation (4.1), yields a perfectly ordinary&#13;
allocation model:    given wealth, W, choose Mi to maximize V subject to&#13;
budget set (4.5).&#13;
Equation (4.1) is a CES function, with an elasticity of&#13;
substitution (a = 1 l    ).  We can apply standard results by analogy with&#13;
other applications of the CES function (Armington, 1969; Hickman and&#13;
Lau, 1973). Thence:&#13;
a ri-aPi                  -&#13;
Mi =6i V (i)      a=    Vt(t -)/P*]    ,                        (4.6)&#13;
where Pi =   PM with the superscript omitted and&#13;
P* =   A present value price index for all future consumption&#13;
of imports, where&#13;
P* =    I  I   a E (1-a]1-a                                        (4.7)&#13;
1 =0&#13;
Obviously, for practical purposes the unobservable V must be eliminated&#13;
by multiplying equation (4.6) by Pi and P*/P*, summing, and then&#13;
substituting equation (4.7) for P*:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
co            co             Pi.&#13;
_ p1Mi      i I O   0 (VP*)    ).                           (4.8)&#13;
i  0  i    i =0 &#13;
Thus,&#13;
VP*      Pi M  = w                                            (4.9)&#13;
The import plan derived from equation (4.1), given expectations about&#13;
future variables, then becomes:&#13;
P Mi = 6               W(.                                   (4.10)&#13;
This equation implies that if present value prices are equal in&#13;
each   year, imports   will  vary   over  time   according   to 6di.     Since&#13;
6  &lt; 6     1- i.e., more distant imports are valued less -- they will&#13;
fall over time. From equations (4.6) and (4.7) it may also be shown&#13;
that if the time-discounted present value prices (pi/6 d) were equal, the&#13;
level of imports would be constant.&#13;
Recalling that we are interested only in the first year's&#13;
imports (i = 0) from a series of plans formulated in years t = 1, 2...T,&#13;
equation (4.10) generates the estimating equation&#13;
aPt 1 -a&#13;
ptMt =6 g(P*)          w,                                    (4.11)&#13;
t t &#13;
where the subscript t denotes variables measured in period t and where&#13;
=1.&#13;

The Rate of Time Preference&#13;
There are three problems (at least) in implementing equation&#13;
(4.11).    First  is  its non-linearity.     All applications    of  the CES&#13;
function face the problem that P*, the aggregate price index, depends on&#13;
the unknown parameter a.     This problem is easily solved, however,       by&#13;
non-linear estimation methods or linear approximations (Hickman and Lau,&#13;
1973).   Our problem is, however, much greater: it is that the 6i are&#13;
unknown.&#13;
Let the rate of time discount -- assumed to be constant both&#13;
across plans and between plans -      be d.   The discount factor relating&#13;
-i&#13;
year i's consumption     to year  0's,  6i' is (1 + d)    ,  or, in obvious&#13;
notation,    Si.  Thus, all our unknowns about time discounting can be&#13;
collapsed into a single parameter 6, which appears in equation (4.7),&#13;
the   formula  for   P*.     Jumping  ahead,   we  find   it   convenient  to&#13;
characterize the present value price series as having a constant growth&#13;
rate  over  each  plan   (but  not  between  plans).    Thus,  for  the plan&#13;
formulated at t, we assume that prices in the years ahead are expected&#13;
to be:&#13;
i&#13;
Pi(t) = n Pt,                                                (4.12)&#13;
where nt is the rate of growth of present value prices assumed in plan t&#13;
which, along with Pt, is assumed to be known exogenously.          Thus, from&#13;
equation (4.7),&#13;
P                t         Pt&#13;
p     a (1 _dn1        a-                         (4.13)&#13;
Pt       16fl          )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
whence equation (4.11) becomes&#13;
ptM  = (1      I t1  a) W.                                 (4. 14)&#13;
Equation (4.14) can be estimated in a number of different&#13;
forms.   -For example, it can be transformed into a linear equation as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Pt t&#13;
from which&#13;
p M&#13;
log (1    W t     a log 6 - (1 - a) log     .              (4.15)&#13;
wt                             l&#13;
Whether this approach is desirable, however, depends on the nature of&#13;
the error process underlying the data.       The errors of the regression&#13;
equation should be normally distributed, homoskedastic and mutually&#13;
uncorrelated.   If those of equation (4.14) were, then those of equation&#13;
(4.15)   certainly  would   not  be,  and   vice-versa.     In  fact,   such&#13;
transformations appear to make very little difference at estimation&#13;
time.&#13;
In a consumption framework, the constancy of the rate of time&#13;
discount has some plausibility. However, in an investment context, the&#13;
rate of discount will be related to the (expected) marginal productivity&#13;
of investment, which may vary over time. As an alternative to the basic&#13;
model, therefore, we consider a so-called "disequilibrium" model, in&#13;
which the rate of time discount varies with investment opportunities. 1/&#13;
1/ "Disequilibrium" is perhaps not such a good nomenclature as "non-&#13;
steady-state,"   but  we  prefer   it  on  the  grounds   of  stylistic&#13;
elegance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
When the capital stock is below that required by the Keynes-&#13;
Ramsey optimal growth path, the marginal return on investment and the&#13;
growth rate of GDP will be relatively high, and there will be an&#13;
incentive to reschedule national absorption from the future back to the&#13;
present. (Consumption may be lower under these circumstances, but total&#13;
absorption,  of  which   imports  form a part,   will   be higher.)    This&#13;
condition is reflected in our model by a fall in 6 -- future output is&#13;
given relatively lower weight. We explore this possibility by setting&#13;
log 6 = dt = p + Igt                                       (4.16)&#13;
where gt can be the growth rate of GDP, the ratio of investment to GDP&#13;
or the ratio of investment to wealth. In each case we would expect&#13;
I1 &lt; 0.&#13;
There is, however, a great danger of simultaneity bias in&#13;
substituting  equation   (4.16)  into  (4.14)  and (4.15).    Investment by&#13;
developing countries is often thought to depend on imports, in that if&#13;
the foreign exchange does not exist to generate a flow of imported&#13;
capital  goods,   then  investment   will  not  take  place.     By  way  of&#13;
illustration, in Malaysia in 1980, imports of machinery and transport&#13;
equipment were around M$9 billion (about 30 percent of imports) and&#13;
total fixed capital formation was around M$15 billion.        These figures&#13;
counsel   great   caution   in   the   use   and   interpretation   of   the&#13;
disequilibrium results.&#13;
The derivation of equation (4.13) assumes that 6°i 1         &lt; &lt; 1.&#13;
t&#13;
If this assumption were violated, it would benefit the country to import&#13;
infinite amounts now and pay off the debt later with depreciated cash.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
Thus, in these circumstances, the country will be constrained in its&#13;
borrowing by the lenders and will fall ou,side the purview of our&#13;
model.       This   situation    suggests   that    any   observation    for&#13;
which 6 a      a &gt; 1 should be omitted from our sample.      Unfortunately,&#13;
however,    this    approach    is   not    necessarily    straightforward.&#13;
Assuming 6 &lt; 1 and, if, as seems reasonable,      0 4 a &lt; 1,   a sufficient&#13;
condition for the inequality is that nt &lt; 1, which in turn amounts to&#13;
assuming that the real rate of interest (in import terms) is positive,&#13;
that is, that import prices increase less rapidly than the rate of&#13;
interest.      If,   however, nt &gt; 1, the    inequality   depends   on   the&#13;
unknowns 6 and a, and so cannot be tested prior to estimation. However,&#13;
to estimate 6 and a correctly, we need to know which observations to&#13;
include! Short of a switching-regime model, there is no simple solution&#13;
to this dilemma, and it has to be treated ad hoc.&#13;
Measuring Wealth&#13;
The second problem area concerns the measurement of wealth.&#13;
Conceptually it is very simple to do:      wealth constitutes owned assets&#13;
plus the present value of the stream of foreign exchange receipts, less&#13;
scheduled repayments on accumulated debts.&#13;
Owned assets should contain a wide range of instruments, but in&#13;
practice data are available only for international reserves and the net&#13;
assets of the banking system.     For many developing countries, however,&#13;
these data probably provide a reasonable approximation of foreign-&#13;
denominated  wealth.    We  shall  assume   that  domestic  assets  are  not&#13;
convertible into foreign exchange, that is, that borrowing is possible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
against future export earnings but not against domestic assets, a fairly&#13;
strong assumption.&#13;
The present value of export earnings provides no conceptual&#13;
problems, once expectations have been determined, but there is one&#13;
practical difficulty.    If we assume an infinite planning horizon, as&#13;
above, the present value becomes infinite if the (expected) rate of&#13;
growth of earnings exceeds the (expected) rate of interest.          If the&#13;
former is denoted by vx and the latter by r (both assumed to be&#13;
constant), the present value Wx is:&#13;
co          icXo             + vx&#13;
Wx =        (1 + r)i Xi=    i     I1 + r}                  (4.17)&#13;
which is clearly finite only if the bracketed term is less than one.     It&#13;
is not inconceivable that a country should believe itself infinitely&#13;
rich, but it is inconceivable that other countries would lend it the&#13;
infinite   amounts   it  would   immediately   wish  to   borrow.     Thus,&#13;
whenever vx &gt; rt, the borrower will be supply-constrained in the loans&#13;
market, which would put it beyond our model, a situation that suggests&#13;
we should drop those observations from our sample.&#13;
Two alternatives to dropping the observations exist. First, we&#13;
could respecify the model in terms of an (arbitrary) finite time&#13;
horizon.   This procedure, while it would complicate certain formulae,&#13;
would not change anything fundamental. In these circumstances, Wx would&#13;
merely  become  very  large.    Second,   we  could  argue  that  countries&#13;
experiencing v X &gt; rt would recognize it as a temporary phenomenon and&#13;
would re-adjust their expectations to reverse the inequality.        (It is&#13;
moot whether world income is actually bounded above.)      In this case we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
would merely impose some arbitrary lower limit on (rt - vtX), say, 0.01,&#13;
and use this to calculate present value.      A similar approach would be&#13;
justified if we explicitly recognized uncertainty, for a risk-averse&#13;
country would presumably discount future export growth, which would also&#13;
reduce the long-run average v x below rt.&#13;
An additional factor that must be considered is capital grants,&#13;
which are straight    additions  to wealth.     We assume   that  recipients&#13;
expect to receive the same nominal grants in the future as in the&#13;
current year.&#13;
More complex is concessionary borrowing.     While current market&#13;
borrowing makes no addition to net wealth, borrowing on softer terms&#13;
clearly does so.     We assume that such borrowing is rationed by the&#13;
donors.      If  a   loan  of   C   is  made   at  concessionary   interest&#13;
rate ri, rather than at market rate ri, the increment to wealth, or the&#13;
grant element of the loan, GE, is:&#13;
n&#13;
GE   i      Pi ( i   d)                                    (4.18)&#13;
where&#13;
Pi = The discount factor for year i at market rates,&#13;
Ri = The necessary repayment stream if ri had ruled (C = X piRi)&#13;
Ri = The repayment stream at rate ri (using discount factors&#13;
Pi, C = E piRi, and assuming constant repayments starting&#13;
immediately are required).&#13;
If the loan is for perpetuity and the rates of interest are constant,&#13;
the grant element is easily calculated as:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
eO                  co&#13;
GE   =    op1 (Ri- ii) =i     _ p  (rC - rC)&#13;
i  ~~~~~~~O &#13;
= C (r - r) (+r)                     (4.19)&#13;
Obviously, calculating the grant elements requires detailed&#13;
information on the nature of the loan, in particular, on the repayment&#13;
stream.    This  information   is not   easily available   to us,   but  the&#13;
External Debt Division of the World Bank has the data and has calculated&#13;
the grant elements, assuming that r = 10 percent.       The precise formula&#13;
is:&#13;
GE=~ (1- na)            + (1 + -aG     +r -am&#13;
r/aGE(1+ r')            - (1 + r') =}           (4.20)&#13;
ri                 r'(aM   aG)&#13;
where a = The number of repayments a year,&#13;
r' = The market rate per period, such that (1 + rn)a = (1 + r)&#13;
= 1.1,&#13;
G = The grace period before repayments commence and&#13;
M = The maturity of the loan,&#13;
and where it is assumed that the disbursement is made at the end of year&#13;
0 and that the principal is repaid linearly over the time period G to M.&#13;
Current borrowing affects net wealth only to the extent that&#13;
interest rates are below market rates. Past borrowing, however, affects&#13;
wealth more directly, for it reduces current wealth because it must be&#13;
repaid. Unfortunately, data on required future repayments at each point&#13;
in time are not easily available, and an approximation is needed.        The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
total of outstanding debt disbursed at any time (i.e., the principal) is&#13;
known.   We assume that payments of interest are up to date; so that&#13;
outstanding debt represents the amount that, if paid immediately, would&#13;
just  repay  all   liabilities.    In  other words,   at  market   rates  of&#13;
interest, this total just represents the net present value of the future&#13;
repayment stream. However, because concessionary borrowing does not pay&#13;
market rates, we must reduce this total by the extent of the grant&#13;
element. Since we do not know the dates at which current outstanding&#13;
debts were taken out, we use the mean grant element over the sample&#13;
period for this calculation.&#13;
- Strictly speaking, the grant elements should grow with the&#13;
current rate of interest:      the higher current rates, the greater the&#13;
benefit that a fixed concessionary rate involves, and hence the greater&#13;
the excess of the value of the outstanding debt (the capital value) over&#13;
the present value of the actual repayment stream.      This situation again&#13;
is  a  matter   of  approximation.    Assuming   that  all  loans  are   for&#13;
perpetuity, we can calculate the implied rate of interest (taking into&#13;
account grace periods) using equation (4.19), our assumed grant element&#13;
and the fact that the grant elements are calculated assuming a market&#13;
rate of 10 percent.    The implied rate of interest suggests a repayment&#13;
stream, which is then converted      into a capital value at the ruling&#13;
(expected) rate of interest.   This capital value is then subtracted from&#13;
wealth.&#13;
Non-concessionary borrowing is in principle like concessionary&#13;
borrowing. We assume that it has a grant element of zero (although, in&#13;
fact, borrowing is classed as non-concessionary if its grant element is&#13;
below 25 percent).    Thus, no adjustment to current wealth is required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
We   calculate   the   negotiated   interest   on   the   outstanding   non-&#13;
concessionary debt as a weighted average of the market rate over the&#13;
previous five years.    For the fixed rate debt, we then use this result&#13;
to calculate the capital value of future repayments. Non-concessionary&#13;
debt also includes variable rate loans, however, that must be treated&#13;
differently.    The capital value of the principal outstanding is the&#13;
principal itself if, as we assume, variable rate loans must be paid at&#13;
market  rates.    This  situation is handled    simply.    We also assume,&#13;
however, that between the time of negotiation and the present, any&#13;
excess of actual interest payments over those expected when the loan was&#13;
taken out is added to the principal outstanding at the present.         This&#13;
condition is not reflected in the World Bank data and thus must be added&#13;
in.&#13;
Our only data are one figure a year on the share of outstanding&#13;
debt that is at variable rates (from the World Bank Debt Tables). From&#13;
this we calculate the absolute amount at variable rates and assume that&#13;
this total had been negotiated over the previous five years, with equal&#13;
shares of variable interest debt in total debt in each year.           Thus,&#13;
given a stock of variable rate debt in year t, Vt, we calculate the&#13;
amounts negotiated in year (t - i), iVt, where     i = l...m, as&#13;
Lt &#13;
V                 Vt                                      (4.21)&#13;
i t     5&#13;
j  Lt   j&#13;
where Lt _j is total non-concessionary loans received in year (t -&#13;
J).   This procedure is dreadfully crude (and temporally inconsistent),&#13;
but it probably meets our need to pick up major interest rate mistakes&#13;
satisfactorily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
For  loans   negotiated  in  year   (t -   i),  the  interest   rate&#13;
surprise in year (t - i + J) is (rt - i + j -          i + jr    -   )where&#13;
rs is the market     rate  for year   s and   sru the    rate in year s as&#13;
expected in year u.    Thus,  the additional   payment   on  these loans   is&#13;
v  (r                        re     ), which  must   be  cumulated   forward&#13;
from (t - i + J) to the present, t.      Finally, we must sum over the five&#13;
previous years in which the loans were assumed to be raised.&#13;
In calculating the burden of interest rate surprises, we make&#13;
two approximations for simplicity's sake: we assume (1) that the burden&#13;
arising because rt - i + j exceeds the expected rate accumulates to year&#13;
t at interest rate rt - i+ j, rather than at rates (rt - i + j, rt - i&#13;
+ j + 1)..., etc.; and (2) that debtors expect to pay off their debt at&#13;
their long-run expected rate (re e     )  a constant, rather than at year-&#13;
t- &#13;
specific rates. Thus, the change in the principal outstanding in year t&#13;
attributable to previous interest rate shocks is&#13;
5        i-Ie &#13;
I Vt(          [r  - t  + j - rt - i   [1 + rt -          - +). (4.22)&#13;
This treatment of variable rate loans refers only to loans that&#13;
are explicitly at variable rates and ignores any fixed rate loans that&#13;
were contracted with the intention of renewal.       In the absence of data,&#13;
we have no alternative.&#13;
These calculations use data from the World Bank's External Debt&#13;
Division and thus cover only loans with maturities of one year or&#13;
more.    Thus,  we  implicitly  assume   that  short-term  borrowing  has no&#13;
wealth effects, i.e., it is always at a rate of interest sufficiently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
close to current market rates that any revaluations may be ignored.&#13;
This assumption applies   not only to   new loans, but   also to roll-over&#13;
credits  with  periodicities  of less than one year.       These are not&#13;
entirely happy assumptions, but they seem unavoidable.&#13;
Observe that this treatment of grants and borrowing in the&#13;
wealth calculations assumes that the loans are disbursed entirely in&#13;
year 0.    This  assumption leads to some overstatement of the grant&#13;
element  if,  in  fact,  disbursement  is delayed.     Beyond  that  small&#13;
discrepancy, however, the pattern of disbursements is not important&#13;
under our assumptions, since we presume that any amount of borrowing or&#13;
lending may be undertaken at market rates.     Thus, any given pattern of&#13;
gross disbursements may be translated into the desired time pattern of&#13;
expenditures just like any other foreign exchange receipt. (Indeed, in&#13;
theory we could test whether developing countries are constrained in the&#13;
capital markets by seeing whether, given wealth, imports respond to&#13;
different disbursement patterns.)&#13;
There is, however, one set of circumstances in which our&#13;
assumption of independence between the disbursement and expenditure&#13;
patterns may be violated, even with perfect capital markets.        Assume&#13;
that a loan's disbursements are tied to expenditures on a particular&#13;
project.    We  would  expect   to  find  a  closer  relationship  between&#13;
disbursements and imports than between commitments and imports if the&#13;
project being financed (1) requires only "additional" imports, in the&#13;
sense that none of them would be bought in the absence of the loan, (2)&#13;
imposes a rigid time pattern for these imports, and (3) has no effect on&#13;
other imports. This situation basically implies that tied loans finance&#13;
projects   that  the   borrower's  government   feels  are   not  socially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
profitable and hence that it would not finance out of its own&#13;
borrowing.  In these cases, wealth must be reduced by the extent of the&#13;
disbursement, for while the repayments still represent claims on the&#13;
"general fund," the loan itself does not contribute to the latter.&#13;
Hence, we would need to adjust our existing measure of wealth as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Restricted loan             Adjustment to measured wealth&#13;
Non-concessionary           Subtract current disbursements&#13;
Concessionary               Subtract current disbursements less&#13;
the current grant elements and the&#13;
present   value   of   future   grant&#13;
elements&#13;
Grants                      Subtract the present value of future&#13;
grants.&#13;
Note that by removing the present value of anticipated grants and grant&#13;
elements, we are implicitly assuming that restricted loans are not&#13;
expected to be renewed.&#13;
Without a huge amount of detailed research, it is impossible to&#13;
know how borrowing is distributed between these constrained and&#13;
unconstrained forms.    However, provided the distribution is constant&#13;
over time, an adjustment to the estimating equation is feasible.&#13;
Equation (4.14) becomes:&#13;
Pt t= (1 _         - a) (Wt- aWt) + aD                    (4.23)&#13;
where WI = The addition to wealth stemming from receipts of (but not&#13;
repayments on) all loans and grants of the type subject&#13;
to restriction,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
a   = The share of restricted-type loans actually subject to&#13;
restriction and&#13;
Dt  = Disbursements of restricted-type loans.&#13;
The constant, a, is theoretically estimable, but in practice it&#13;
proved  possible  only   to  restrict  it  a priori.     Specifically,  we&#13;
experimented with (a = 1) for various definitions of WI, e.g., that all&#13;
concessionary loans are subject to restriction.&#13;
If the conditions under which disbursements and imports are&#13;
linked, are considered sufficiently unlikely in perfect capital markets,&#13;
tests on equation (4.23) could be interpreted as tests of the hypothesis&#13;
of perfect capital markets.     If disbursements matter, capital markets&#13;
are not perfect.&#13;
Expectations&#13;
The third problem area with equation (4.11) is the treatment of&#13;
expectations.    Expectations  figure very prominently in the model as&#13;
outlined, and clearly their measurement is a crucial consideration.&#13;
However,  we have   little guidance   as to how to proceed.       Below we&#13;
experiment with different approaches, so that a number of alternatives&#13;
are listed.&#13;
We require very simple mechanisms for expectations, for they&#13;
must  be both practical    and forecastable.    These mechanisms usually&#13;
amount to assuming a constant rate of growth for the variable&#13;
concerned.    We  do,  however,  use  certain  exogenous  information  for&#13;
particular years of the sample period or particular components of wealth&#13;
where this seems necessary, as, for example, with expectations about oil&#13;
prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
Rational expectations are currently popular, but they do not&#13;
entirely answer our needs.     First, we do not have a complete model, so&#13;
the expectational component cannot be substituted out. Second, while it&#13;
would be convenient to assume that in each year agents had unbiased&#13;
expectations of unknown variables, so that we could use actual future&#13;
values as a proxy, this assumption alone does not help because we would&#13;
rapidly run out of future data.       That is, we could not estimate the&#13;
model for say, 1980, because the prices for 1983 are not yet&#13;
available.   We do, however, experiment with forward-looking data, but&#13;
only in conjunction with very crude extrapolative formulae.&#13;
For transaction flows, simple conservative expectations are&#13;
used. The inflow of current and capital grants is expected to continue&#13;
at current nominal rates, and similarly for the grant element in&#13;
concessionary borrowing. The inflow of current credits is broken into a&#13;
price and a quantity dimension.    For the latter we experiment with both&#13;
static expectations and a constant expected growth rate equal to the&#13;
average of the last five years.    After preliminary tests, we select the&#13;
former.    An exception   is where   exports are based on known mineral&#13;
deposits, in which case expectations are roughly based on known&#13;
reserves.&#13;
The price dimension is more tricky still.        Initially we had&#13;
intended to let the expected future growth rate of export and import&#13;
prices   equal   next  year's   actual   rate   (an  element   of  rational&#13;
expectations), and the expected interest rate to equal this year's&#13;
actual rate. This approach leads to fluctuations in measured wealth far&#13;
greater than could be believed a priori, however.      For example, on this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
measure, Malaysia, one of our test countries, would have had an 80&#13;
percent decline in wealth in 1981!&#13;
Two   much    more   conservative    approaches    are   therefore&#13;
considered.    For export prices we again consider static or constant&#13;
growth rate expectations, and again prefer the former.       Meanwhile, the&#13;
interest rate is fixed exogenously either at a nominal 10 percent -- the&#13;
rate the World Bank uses in assessing grant elements -- or at a real 2.5&#13;
percent in the long run.   In the former case, 10 percent is used for all&#13;
years, including the current one; in the latter case, the nominal rate&#13;
is assumed to take three equal annual steps in moving from its current&#13;
level to (2.5 + p ), where p    is the expected long-run change in import&#13;
prices. The resulting interest rate profile is then averaged to get a&#13;
single expected rate, the latter being that constant interest rate&#13;
yielding the same net present value for a constant nominal income stream&#13;
to infinity as the (assumed) variable rate would (see equation [2.3]).&#13;
The expected import price series is calculated by assuming&#13;
that, from three years hence, import prices will grow at their average&#13;
rate over the last five years.     Until then, the growth rate for import&#13;
prices is assumed to take three equal annual steps from the current&#13;
level to that long-run level.&#13;
These procedures are very mechanistic and are imposed a&#13;
priori. As an alternative, we experiment with an empirical approach,&#13;
postulating that, ceteris paribus, a higher rate of investment indicates&#13;
a more optimistic view of the future and thus higher perceived wealth.&#13;
As a crude measure of this alternative, we consider replacing wealth, W,&#13;
in some of the equations above by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
(p, + ''gD  + Wt),                                        (4.24)&#13;
where gt is the investment/GDP ratio or the investment/wealth ratio.&#13;
Empirically, this equation is rather close to the disequilibrium models&#13;
discussed on pages 27-28, and in the estimation we treat equations using&#13;
(4.24) as further disequilibrium models.     (It is to try to distinguish&#13;
the two families of disequilibrium models better that we use equation&#13;
[4.24] rather than the more natural [W' + §'g tWt.)&#13;
Interest Rates&#13;
The model as outlined contains a single interest rate at which&#13;
countries are assumed both to borrow and lend.     This rate should be the&#13;
rate on marginal transactions, and assuming that concessionary loans are&#13;
rationed by the donors regardless of the borrowing aspirations of&#13;
recipients, the marginal transactions will normally be with private&#13;
financial institutions.    We experiment with two possible rates:     first,&#13;
the rate on a country's own long-term borrowing from foreign financial&#13;
institutions, and, second, the 12-month LIBOR (or an approximation of it&#13;
for earlier years). The former captures the country risk premium and so&#13;
may be somewhat endogenous, whereas the latter, while exogenous, may&#13;
lack relevance, given that most countries borrow rather than lend and do&#13;
so at varying premia above LIBOR.&#13;
Dynamics&#13;
The equations as specified above are entirely static.       In the&#13;
real world, there is at least some chance that an adjustment in the&#13;
directions   postulated  takes   time.    Thus,  we   should  consider   the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
possibility of a lagged adjustment.      Given our very small sample of&#13;
observations (see below), doing so is possible only for the simple forms&#13;
of the models and for very simple dynamics. In general, the approach is&#13;
to include only a lagged dependent variable (a partial adjustment&#13;
model), but in certain cases more general forms are feasible.          For&#13;
example,  if   6 = 1   in equation   (4.14),  the  following  equation is&#13;
estimable (where M replaces p M for notational convenience):&#13;
M = a W + 8 MH1 + y W_1 .                                  (4.25)&#13;
Linear restrictions of this equation make the following models testable:&#13;
a static form (B = y = 0), a first difference form (8 = 1, y = -a), a&#13;
partial   adjustment   form   (y = 0),    and   a  "catch-up"   or  serial&#13;
correlation model (y = -aO).&#13;
In the course of early empirical experiments, there is some&#13;
evidence of heteroskedasticity in the residuals of equations such as&#13;
(4.14),  with  the  error  variance  growing  over  time.    We  therefore&#13;
experiment by deflating the whole of the estimation equation by current&#13;
import prices.   This alternative reduces the heteroskedasticity, but it&#13;
also suggests that we should perhaps consider the dynamics of "real"&#13;
imports.   Thus, for example, if we deflate equation (4.25) by current&#13;
prices, and let   a = 0,  we would have:&#13;
Mt           + O+  t- 1&#13;
Pt       Pt         Pt&#13;
However, a natural alternative would be to consider the adjustment of&#13;
(m / M) to itself lagged, viz.,&#13;
p&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
mt       t    0    t-&#13;
Mt      Wt+       Mt -                                     (4.26)&#13;
Pt       Pt       P t-&#13;
This approach has considerable intuitive appeal -      it is, after&#13;
all, the adjustment of the quantity of imports that is painful and&#13;
costly -- and it also allows direct comparison with "traditional"&#13;
equations, which are usually specified in real terms (see below).&#13;
Most of the following estimation -makes use of the lagged&#13;
dependent variable to add a dynamic element to our models.&#13;

V. THE DOMESTIC MODEL&#13;
The second of our models, the domestic one, is a development of&#13;
the first.   Whereas in the first, following Hemphill, we consider only&#13;
the  import  sector,  in the second     we extend   the analysis     to the&#13;
domestic  economy,  following   Sachs  and Dornbusch.     The extension   is&#13;
straightforward, at least in a formal sense.      However, two new sets of&#13;
problems   present    themselves:      first,   how  to   incorporate    the&#13;
macroeconomic balances and, second, what units to work in.&#13;
Sachs' Model&#13;
Sachs' model, which is built around the national accounting&#13;
identity, distinguishes two goods and uses world money as the&#13;
numeraire. As noted, the import good has a fixed world price, while the&#13;
export good faces a downward sloping demand curve.       Its price does not&#13;
appear explicitly, however, as it is substituted out by factors&#13;
determining the supply and demand for exports. (Sachs has a very simple&#13;
model of exports, with unit elastic demand and a single factor&#13;
exponential supply function).     The resulting basic equation (based on&#13;
equation [2.10] is:&#13;
CA  = f(W ) + a   (G - G ) + a2 (T - T ) + a3 (R - R ),     (5.1)&#13;
t      t      123&#13;
which expresses the current account as a function of wealth, plus the&#13;
deviations from "perpetuity values" of government expenditures, world&#13;
demand  and   productivity.     For  our  purposes,   we  assume   that  all&#13;
adjustment on the current account occurs through imports, with exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
and factor payments taken as predetermined. Thus, equation (5.1) can be&#13;
treated as an import function.&#13;
The estimation of the perpetuity values of G,T and R is&#13;
problematical, in that they refer to perpetuity values as perceived at&#13;
time t.   Thus expectations are involved.    As a first pass, however, we&#13;
take   them  as   trend  lines   through  their   respective   samples  of&#13;
observations.&#13;
Sachs assumes that government expenditure is exogenous and that&#13;
investment is determined by the wealth function as part of private&#13;
absorption.   (He ignores the feedback from investment to output, as do&#13;
we).    Both assumptions  are somewhat suspect:     governments may well&#13;
restrict their expenditures with a view to the current account, while&#13;
the dichotomy between savers and investors may cause investment to have&#13;
an exogenous component. Thus the term (G - GP) may be displaced by (I -&#13;
IP) or dropped entirely from equation (5.1), with corresponding&#13;
adjustments to the definition of wealth.&#13;
Sachs also implicitly assumes that all wealth is owned&#13;
privately rather than publicly.     Thus, the permanent value of private&#13;
consumption CP equals r*W.    This view arises from the assumptions that&#13;
the government finances its exogenous expenditures that contribute&#13;
nothing to utility from either current or future taxation, and that&#13;
future taxation is perfectly foreseen by the private sector and is&#13;
capitalized into its estimate of wealth.      It seems equally plausible,&#13;
however, to assume that the government has some claim on wealth, a view&#13;
that   reinforces  the   argument   for  combining   public   and  private&#13;
consumption into the same process by-dropping (G - GP) and redefining&#13;
wealth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
Similarly, the terms (T - TP) and (R - RP) are under threat.&#13;
They appear in the equation by virtue of Sachs' simple model of exports&#13;
and output.   As we are not committed to this model, we work directly&#13;
with deviations in output.&#13;
The final component of equation (5.1) is the wealth function.&#13;
It is similar to the functions developed for the previous model but has&#13;
some additional   features.    Consumption is related to total private&#13;
wealth. Given that spot estimates of wealth are notoriously scarce and&#13;
unreliable, the best definition appears to be reserves plus the grant&#13;
and borrowing terms described earlier plus the present value of the&#13;
expected stream of GNP net of government expenditures.     This definition&#13;
includes, inter alia, all human and physical wealth and current income&#13;
from abroad. We assume constant expected growth rates for real GNP and&#13;
the appropriate deflator, with the former rate generally set equal to&#13;
zero.&#13;
The estimating equation based on Sachs' model is thus&#13;
Ptt M    CAt + Pt Xt   IPDt&#13;
or&#13;
(PtX              -               aIPD - p M )ant  ) Wt - a1(G - GP)  (5.2)&#13;
- a (T - T ) - a (R - R )&#13;
where IPDt = The flow of interest abroad.&#13;
The functional form of the wealth component has been taken from&#13;
equations (4.1)-(4.15), but with consumption replacing imports and a&#13;
broader definition of wealth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
Dornbusch's Model&#13;
An alternative approach to the domestic model is Dornbusch's&#13;
(1983).  He assumes a traded/non-traded dichotomy and uses traded goods&#13;
as his numeraire.     He also assumes only a single component of demand&#13;
(called consumption), so that his macrobalances are particularly&#13;
simple.   He finds the relative price of traded and non-traded goods a&#13;
significant factor in the overall demand for consumption.&#13;
We need to make slight adjustments to Dornbusch's model to&#13;
permit us to work in a money metric -- essentially, we define the&#13;
interest rate in real terms relative to (expected) import prices.&#13;
Thereafter, combining the model with the macroeconomic balance equation&#13;
generates an import function&#13;
M = C - GNP + IPD + X.                                      (5.3)&#13;
That is, imports equal "total consumption" less GDP plus interest&#13;
payments and exports, all measured in foreign prices.       With C covering&#13;
all expenditures, wealth has to include the present value of total&#13;
future GNP.   It is possible to adapt equation (5.3) to allow for other&#13;
elements of macro-imbalance along the lines of (5.1); for example, we&#13;
could remove government expenditures from the accumulated values of GNP&#13;
in the calculation of wealth and include (G - GP) directly in the&#13;
equation.&#13;
Again, the formalities of the wealth explanation of consumption&#13;
may be taken from above, but with the price term altered to reflect&#13;
relative import and domestic prices.&#13;
A more direct approach to Dornbusch'ls model is to exploit its&#13;
intertemporal separability, using wealth to determine total absorption,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
but then using current variables alone to explain the allocation of the&#13;
latter between imports and domestic goods.        In fact, Dornbusch has a&#13;
Cobb-Douglas function for this division, so that imports claim a&#13;
constant share of absorption.     We have chosen to generalize the model&#13;
slightly, using a CES function. Thus, given the value of absorption, A,&#13;
from the wealth calculation,&#13;
P  t    a (p)    (PtAt),                                     (5.4)&#13;
where Pt = The aggregate price index for year t,&#13;
(pM)a (pD)l - a                                           (55)&#13;
Pt     t     t                                             5)&#13;
and where a may be calculated as (pMM/PA) in the base year of the index&#13;
numbers,   year   0.     Using   an  equivalent   of   equation   (4.15)   to&#13;
determine P tAt -- current absorption -    and manipulating so as to reach&#13;
the equivalent of (4.15), we get&#13;
-  =      N &#13;
ptM  = a (    87)  (1 _ 6d  1    -  Wt                       (5.6)&#13;
where nt = The deflator for total absorption.&#13;
For both the Sachs and Dornbusch formulations, lagged dependent&#13;
variables are included at estimation time to allow some element of&#13;
dynamic adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
VI. SPECIFICATION TESTS OF THE FOREIGN WEALTH MODEL&#13;
There are two components to the empirical application of a&#13;
model.   The first is to try to identify the correct model, while the&#13;
second, having done so, is to get the best possible estimate of it. The&#13;
former concerns hypothesis testing, the latter does not.&#13;
In   the   present  paper,   we   distinguish   these   operations&#13;
carefully.   In this section, we explore the various specifications of&#13;
the models discussed above -- comparing, for example, different&#13;
formulations of expectations and different treatments of potentially&#13;
restricted   loans.     From   these   experiments   we   derive  preferred&#13;
specifications of the two models -- foreign and domestic -- in their two&#13;
forms -- equilibrium and disequilibrium.      In the second set of tests,&#13;
described in the next section, we compare these models between&#13;
themselves and with two simple alternative models:      Hemphill's equation&#13;
(2.1) and a traditional equation relating imports to GDP and relative&#13;
import  and  domestic   prices.    These   comparisons  yield  a generally&#13;
preferred model of imports.&#13;
It should be emphasized at this stage that all our tests are of&#13;
composite hypotheses comprising, first, the truth of the model concerned&#13;
and,  second,  our ability to measure the concepts accurately.          This&#13;
observation is, of course, true of all applied economics, but it is&#13;
particularly relevant here, given the manifest problems of measurement.&#13;
However,  applied  economics   does require operational models.       Hence,&#13;
while it may be---philosophically feasible to claim that rejections of a&#13;
particular model arise from its measurement problems, rather than from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
its theoretical shortcomings, it is not practically very useful, at&#13;
least until equally plausible alternative measures have been discovered.&#13;
This section starts by considering the sample data and the&#13;
estimation methods adopted. It then specifies more precisely the nature&#13;
of  our  general  tests  of  specification.     These  involve  estimating&#13;
alternative   models  under   a  series   of  different  assumptions   and&#13;
attempting to draw from the results some broadly consistent conclusions&#13;
about the types of models that were introduced before. Specifically, we&#13;
seek   strong  evidence   to   reject   the  null   hypothesis   that  the&#13;
intertemporal approach to imports is useful.     The restrictions of the&#13;
null hypothesis we test are that all components of wealth affect imports&#13;
equally and that neither the pattern of disbursements of loans nor the&#13;
stock of outstanding    debt  affects  imports.    Additionally,  we  seek&#13;
information about the best interest rate to use.      The three countries&#13;
used in these experiments show a strong degree of uniformity in their&#13;
conclusions on these issues.&#13;
The Sample&#13;
The preliminary experiments are conducted on three developing&#13;
countries chosen at random in a stratified sample.      The wealth model,&#13;
with its assumption of unrestricted borrowing, is likely to be more&#13;
applicable to middle-income than to low-income developing countries.&#13;
Within that sub-set we seek countries from three different continents,&#13;
with at least one oil-exporting and one oil-importing country. Finally,&#13;
the countries chosen have to meet certain minimal conditions of data&#13;
availability.     (We   diplomatically   ignore   the  question   of  data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
quality.)   The three countries chosen are, in the order in which they&#13;
are tested, Malaysia, Colombia and Kenya.&#13;
Details of the raw data are given in the Appendix 1. Briefly,&#13;
however, they cover 1965-82 annually, although for several variables&#13;
earlier data are also required. The principal sources are International&#13;
Financial Statistics Yearbook, (1983), Balance of Payments Statistics&#13;
and the World Bank Debt System.       In a few cases,    interpolations or&#13;
extrapolations are required,    as noted below.     It seems desirable to&#13;
stretch the sample data as far as possible in both directions in time,&#13;
given the heavy load they have to bear; even so, our 18 observations is&#13;
embarrassingly small, especially for the asymptotic test we apply&#13;
below.   Ideally, the models should be tested by their predictions of&#13;
imports for 1983, as the fierce reductions in imports in that year were&#13;
almost universally attributed to financial stringency.       Unfortunately,&#13;
however, the data are not yet available for such an acid test.&#13;
All the calculations in this section have been conducted using&#13;
TROLL on the World Bank's IBM 3083 computer.       (Many tests, as well as&#13;
all the data preparation, have been carried out by Kathi Yu, to whom I&#13;
am most grateful.)&#13;
The Estimation&#13;
All the models in this section are estimated by single equation&#13;
least squares methods.      Given the small samples, more sophisticated&#13;
approaches   are  probably   not  warranted.     There   is,  however,   one&#13;
potentially   serious   problem   that   deserves  mention    and  for   the&#13;
illumination of which we are indebted to- Professor Jonathan Eaton.       We&#13;
assume the exogeneity of export earnings in foreign currency terms.       If&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
this assumption is correct, the only role that import prices play in our&#13;
models is the intertemporal one explored in detail above.       If, on the&#13;
other hand, export revenues are endogenous, this condition involves a&#13;
simultaneity bias in our estimates, for we omit a second role of import&#13;
prices -- that of influencing the overall levels (present values) of&#13;
exports and imports.    Under these circumstances, the direction of the&#13;
bias depends on whether the country is on the elastic or the inelastic&#13;
segment of its offer curve.    If expenditures on imports (and hence the&#13;
required export revenue) fall as import prices rise, then the&#13;
coefficient on import prices in our equation will overstate the degree&#13;
of intertemporal substitution     (a will exceed a).    Alternatively,  if&#13;
import expenditures rise with import prices, the degree of intertemporal&#13;
substitution will be understated. 1/&#13;
It is difficult to know, a priori, the direction of these&#13;
biases, but their possible existence should be borne in mind in&#13;
interpreting  the  results  below.    We choose not    to allow for them&#13;
formally in the estimation because of the complexity of modelling&#13;
exports and imports simultaneously (especially intertemporally), and the&#13;
fact that, with small samples, ordinary or non-linear least squares are&#13;
often felt to be at least as efficient as simultaneous estimation&#13;
methods, in a mean squared error sense.&#13;
1/       These biases are derived from a simple log-linear version of&#13;
equation (4.11).    The non-linear forms are more complex, but&#13;
the result probably can be generalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
The Tests&#13;
Each country is subjected to the same battery of specification&#13;
tests.  We first explore whether all components of wealth have the same&#13;
impact  on   imports.    Wealth   is  defined  precisely   in  the  earlier&#13;
discussion as assets plus the net present value of exports, grants and&#13;
the grant element of concessionary borrowing, plus the (negative)&#13;
effects of repayments on past loans.     In theory, each component has the&#13;
same impact on imports.      Thus a preliminary test that can provide a&#13;
rejection of the maintained model is to look for evidence that the&#13;
components have markedly different effects.&#13;
These wealth definition tests are conducted by starting with a&#13;
restricted definition of wealth and progressively testing whether the&#13;
addition of further    components satisfies   the null hypothesis.      Four&#13;
components of wealth are considered:&#13;
(1) Net present value of exports&#13;
(2) Foreign assets&#13;
(3) Net present value of grants and grant elements and&#13;
(4) Repayments.&#13;
They are tested in this order and also with the last two items reversed.&#13;
The test equation, derived from (4.14), was:&#13;
Mt =(l-6\           ) (iW 6+      + i)Wt)                   (6.1)&#13;
where     Mt = The value of imports (previously denoted     pmM&#13;
6 = The (unknown) rate of time discounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
nt = The rate of growth of discounted future import prices&#13;
Wt = The ith component of wealth (e.g., assets or grants) and&#13;
it                        ~~~~~~~~~~i&#13;
iWt = The ith wealth concept              Wt&#13;
The test comprises seeing whether     a = 1.   Similar tests are conducted&#13;
on  the   share  version   of  equations   (4.14)  and   (4.15)  -    and  a&#13;
linearization of (4.14), but in fact neither yields additional&#13;
information.&#13;
The next tests concern the possibility that certain loans are&#13;
restricted in their timing, such that imports and disbursements are&#13;
coincidental.   As noted above, this procedure is largely a test of the&#13;
perfect capital markets hypothesis.     The test equation is (4.23), but&#13;
there appears to be insufficient sample information to estimate a, so&#13;
that  the  constraint  (a =   1) is imposed.     The model is    tested,  as&#13;
written, in share and in linear form, but, again, the last two are quite&#13;
consistent with the first.     These tests are referred to below as the&#13;
restriction tests.&#13;
Both sets of tests are conducted in real and nominal terms and&#13;
for five different interest rates: the actual rate for the country,&#13;
LIBOR, an "expected rate" based on the actual rates (see page 39), the&#13;
same based on LIBOR, and 10 percent.       In addition, various tests are&#13;
conducted using 10 percent as the rate in defining wealth, but an actual&#13;
rate in defining future discounted prices. This process might reflect a&#13;
conservatism in assessing wealth (risk aversion) that is not reflected&#13;
in intertemporal allocations. The restriction tests are also conducted&#13;
with a lagged dependent variable to allow for evident dynamic mis-&#13;
specification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
The comparisons among wealth definitions, loan restrictions and&#13;
interest rates are made in terms of residual sums of squares, error&#13;
whiteness and plausibility.     At least in the wealth definition and&#13;
restriction tests, we are seeking strong evidence of a rejection of our&#13;
null hypothesis that total wealth with no restrictions is the correct&#13;
way  to  proceed.    Thus,   formal  non-nested  procedures  do  not  seem&#13;
warranted, given the small sample, the large range of tests and the&#13;
similarity of the alternatives.&#13;
A typical set of results from the wealth definition tests is&#13;
given in Table 6.1. While these are based on a constant 10 percent rate&#13;
of interest -- our preferred measure (see below) -- the results for the&#13;
other interest rates and functional forms are very similar.       There is&#13;
clearly some tendency for different elements of wealth to affect imports&#13;
differently, but except for Malaysia and foreign assets in Colombia and&#13;
Kenya, this tendency is not particularly marked. Owned assets appear to&#13;
stimulate imports more strongly than other elements of wealth; this&#13;
result may reflect their role as collateral for additional borrowing&#13;
("banks only lend to people who don't need money"), in which case our&#13;
capital market assumptions are violated. Grants appear precisely as do&#13;
other components of wealth, while repayments have different effects in&#13;
different  countries.     In  Malaysia,  higher   repayments  (a  negative&#13;
component of wealth) curtail imports strongly, while in Colombia they&#13;
are (insignificantly) associated with higher imports.&#13;

The restriction tests also generate somewhat mixed results,&#13;
with occasional improvements in fit from treating some loans directly.&#13;
Table 6.2 presents a typical set of results. As before, the conclusions&#13;
are quite robust with respect to changes in interest rates, functional&#13;
form, and dynamic specification.        The only consistent pattern in these&#13;

non-concessionary   loans  entering   directly.    Since   the  resulting&#13;
improvement in fit is very slight, however, and since non-concessionary&#13;
borrowing seems, a priori, the flow least likely to be subject to timing&#13;
restrictions, this outcome does not constitute a convincing rejection of&#13;
our postulated model.    Thus we would conclude that any loans that are&#13;
actually restricted do not increase the overall level of imports and are&#13;
compensated for by changes in unrestricted or commercial borrowing.&#13;
This interpretation is consistent with our perfect capital markets&#13;
hypothesis.&#13;
The next issue to be decided is the interest rate to be used.&#13;
The two batches of tests above were conducted on all the interest rates&#13;
and combinations mentioned above, and certain other equations that are&#13;
introduced below were also estimated with different interest rates to&#13;
check whether subsequent specification tests might affect the choice of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
rates.   Thus, we have a considerable number of observations        (not, of&#13;
course, all mutually independent) with which to make the choice.        Table&#13;
6.3  presents   some   typical  results:     the  standard   errors   of  the&#13;
regressions from equation (4.14) estimated with a lagged dependent&#13;

See page 27 for an explanation.&#13;
It is very clear from this table that the simple 10 percent&#13;
interest rate dominates the others, at least for the calculation of&#13;
wealth. The reason is partly that the actual interest rates cause the&#13;
wealth estimates   to fluctuate unrealistically:       for example, with no&#13;
changes in actual flows, cutting the interest rate from 10 percent to 8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
percent  increases   wealth  by around   20 percent.      Almost  certainly,&#13;
national authorities would discount such fluctuations in estimating&#13;
their wealth, although, curiously, our dampened interest rate series&#13;
(the "expected" rates in Table 6.3) do not improve matters for two out&#13;
of three countries.    (The hypothesis that dampening occurs is supported&#13;
by the fact that the difference between using actual and constant&#13;
interest rates to calculate wealth is emphasized in the absence of the&#13;
lagged dependent variable.)&#13;
The preference for a constant rate of interest casts some doubt&#13;
on our composite hypothesis that the wealth model is correct and that we&#13;
can adequately measure wealth and expectations.      This is partly because&#13;
it is difficult to believe that countries actually reckoned their wealth&#13;
over 1965-80 using a constant nominal interest rate, but also partly&#13;
using a constant interest rate takes the model a long way toward being&#13;
observationally equivalent to a model relating imports to foreign&#13;
exchange receipts. For example, if we measure wealth, W, as exports, X,&#13;
plus grants, G, and assets, A, less repayments, R, then&#13;
_ _ _-, &#13;
W X  +C          R :3&#13;
r    r         r&#13;
and&#13;
M= (1 +     8     = anW (n   = W      (x + G +  A)         R.&#13;
r                    r&#13;
If  rA approximates interest receipts on reserves, only the dependence&#13;
of   p( ) on   n  and the treatment of repayments identifies the wealth&#13;
model from one in which imports are proportionate to current receipts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
In a final set of ad hoc specification tests, we consider&#13;
including in the basic equation the variables reflecting the stock of&#13;
indebtedness.    The latter are important because they offer another&#13;
fairly direct test of the null hypothesis that net wealth determines&#13;
imports.   Under the null hypothesis, stocks of indebtness matter only&#13;
for their influence on net wealth (which enters via Wg), but under many&#13;
reasonable alternatives, they are crucial in determining both a&#13;
country's willingness and its ability to borrow.        Significant stock&#13;
effects are, therefore, bad news for the wealth model.     Three variables&#13;
are considered:   total debt outstanding and disbursed, DOD, DOD relative&#13;
to wealth, and DOD relative to GDP.    For lack of data, only the medium-&#13;
and long-term official borrowing reported to the Bank can be included in&#13;
these measures.   In no case and for no country are the stock of debt&#13;
variables significant.&#13;
The general specification tests have not been described in&#13;
great detail, but the overall tenor of the results is accurately&#13;
represented in the discussion above.       There is no doubt about the&#13;
empirical advantages of assuming a constant 10 percent nominal rate of&#13;
interest, and no question of significant stock of debt effects (other&#13;
than those embodied in the wealth estimate).      On the other hand, the&#13;
wealth definition tests do suggest that owned assets may affect imports&#13;
differently from other components of wealth, and the restriction tests&#13;
do raise some questions about the perfect capital markets hypothesis.&#13;
Overall, therefore, the basic foreign wealth model emerges for&#13;
these tests with at least some credibility:     while there certainly are&#13;
some remaining questions about its relevance that require further&#13;

investigation, it survives the initial tests well enough to warrant&#13;
continuing the present exercise by pitching it against some of the&#13;
alternative theories of developing countries' imports.&#13;

VII. PREFERRED EQUATIONS FOR THE FOREIGN WEALTH MODEL&#13;
We turn now to the refinement of the general foreign wealth&#13;
model into a preferred form for each country.     This exercise involves a&#13;
few remaining hypothesis tests and then the estimation of our final&#13;
equations.   In later sections,    these equations are compared with the&#13;
preferred equations from other models.&#13;
In comparing models, a strong case can be made for comparing&#13;
the equations before any data-directed simplification has occurred, that&#13;
is, for comparing the estimate of the a priori specifications.           For&#13;
several reasons, however, we choose to carry out a little further&#13;
refinement (hypothesis testing). First, in some cases our theory is far&#13;
from definite about whether a variable should be included.       With small&#13;
samples, carrying extraneous variables has a high cost in terms of&#13;
efficiency, and in these cases, if the data do not reject the hypothesis&#13;
that  a  coefficient   is  zero,  we  impose  it.    Second,  the  ultimate&#13;
objective of this exercise is to produce equations for simulation, an&#13;
objective that requires plausible parameter values.        Thus we must be&#13;
prepared to override certain implausible estimates.       To be sure, when&#13;
doing so involves imposing statistically significant constraints, we&#13;
should return to the theory to discover why, but until we have done so,&#13;
it seems reasonable to impose plausibility on an existing model.        This&#13;
is particularly so when several models are being compared: it is useful&#13;
to know if model A plus any necessary plausibility constraints dominates&#13;
model B plus its constraints.    (Simulation models are used to make many&#13;
conditional forecasts, and it is in order that these bear sensible&#13;
relationships to each other that plausibility is required.       If we were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
making  a   single  unconditional  forecast,  the  case  for   overriding&#13;
statistical results with prior views would be much weaker.)&#13;
The criteria used to determine the preferred equations are fit,&#13;
plausibility and error whiteness.    In the discussion that follows, we&#13;
quote for each country the initial dynamic estimate of equation (4.14)&#13;
and  describe  the  path  of inference   followed.    In  particular, we&#13;
highlight and justify any circumstances in which our decisions may be&#13;
thought contentious.     While a degree    of judgment is occasionally&#13;
necessary, we do not believe that other researchers would reach&#13;
fundamentally different conclusions.&#13;
The preferred equations for - the foreign wealth models are&#13;
reported as equations (1) to (4) in Tables 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. The tables&#13;
use the notation developed above for the variables and report several&#13;
summary statistics:  R2, Durbin's h or the Durbin-Watson statistic, the&#13;
standard error of the regression, SER, and the residual sum of squares,&#13;
SSR, in the units of reported equations, and, finally, the SER and SSR&#13;
in terms of the nominal value of imports.&#13;
Malaysia&#13;
Among the most consistent features of the preliminary results&#13;
for Malaysia are the smallness and complete insignificance of the&#13;
coefficient of intertemporal prices, n.&#13;
Mt = (1 - 0.955nt0.011) Wt + 0.625 Mt    1                (7.1)&#13;
(.006) (0.60)      (.073)&#13;
R  = 0.998          Standard error = 382.8&#13;
h = 0.86            SSR/106        = 2.1979&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
The insignificance of discounted prices, n, implies that a,&#13;
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, is not signficantly&#13;
different   from   one,  which   in   turn  means   that  a   Cobb-Douglas&#13;
intertemporal utility function is consistent with the data. This result&#13;
suggests greater intertemporal substitution than we expected a priori,&#13;
but  the   result is strong   and consistent.  Imposing   (a = 1)  reduces&#13;
the standard error of the equation and allows us to use the linear model&#13;
including only W and M as the basis for the tests of dynamic&#13;
specification   (see  equation  [4.25]).    No  equation   dominates  that&#13;
involving only wealth and lagged imports, and so the preferred foreign&#13;
wealth equation is (7.1.1) in Table 7.1.&#13;
We next consider the disequilibrium models, but still in&#13;
nominal terms.   While relating either the rate of time discount or the&#13;
estimate of wealth to the growth rate of GDP yields no significant&#13;
improvements,   relating   them   to   investment   proves   most   useful&#13;
statistically.   Of the two ratios we try, investment relative to wealth&#13;
is preferable, with a standard error of the equation, SER, of about 20&#13;
percent below that from investment relative to GDP. Of the two models,&#13;
relating the rate of time discount to investment (equation 4.16)&#13;
dominates relating wealth to investment (equation 4.24) by a similar&#13;
amount.   In the preferred equation (7.1.3 of Table 7.1), a dollar's&#13;
investment   generates   $0.93   of   imports, and the   hypothesis   that&#13;
the  relationship   is  one-for-one   cannot  be  rejected.     Looked  at&#13;
alternatively, a rise in the investment/wealth ratio of 10 percent from&#13;
its mean of 0.0415 to 0.0457 is associated with a rise in the rate of&#13;
time discount from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent.      It is clear that this&#13;
model is a substantial improvement in terms of fit over the equilibrium&#13;

version of the foreign wealth model.     As observed above, however, there&#13;
are probably more grounds to fear simultaneity bias here than in any of&#13;
the other models considered in this paper.&#13;
The final tests concern the explanation of real imports.        As&#13;
discussed above, imports and wealth are both deflated by current import&#13;
prices, but lagged imports are considered deflated by either current or&#13;
lagged prices. The latter proves superior. The specification tests are&#13;
repeated starting from an estimate of the real equivalent of equation&#13;
(7.1).   Exactly the same conclusions emerge.    The resulting equation is&#13;
(7.1.2) in Table 7.1.      It implies slightly larger errors in nominal&#13;
import predictions than does the nominal equation, which minimizes those&#13;
errors directly.    (The nominal errors from equation [7.1.2] are merely&#13;
those   in  real   imports   multiplied   by  pM    which  is   assumed   to&#13;
be exogenous.) The estimation in real terms reduces the heteroskedas-&#13;
ticity, but from inspection it appears that the errors are still&#13;
substantially larger over the period 1975-82 than prior to 1972.         The&#13;
largest errors affect    1973-75,  which is hardly suprising:      eighteen&#13;
observations   are    too   few   for   conducting   a    formal   test   of&#13;
heteroskedasticity, and as yet no allowance has been made for it in the&#13;
estimation. It is an obvious area for future research.&#13;
The disequilibrium analysis of real imports also mirrors its&#13;
nominal counterpart closely.    Again, the investment/wealth ratio proves&#13;
the most effective of the disequilibrium terms, and, again, it is best&#13;
seen as modifying the rate of time discounting. Its numerical effect is&#13;
substantially reduced, however, by the real transformation, with only&#13;
half of any extra investment showing up as imports.&#13;

Colombia&#13;
In most respects the results for the Colombian foreign wealth&#13;
model   are- very   similar  to   those  for   Malaysia.     Intertemporal&#13;
substitution seems relatively strong (a = 1) and lagged imports highly&#13;
significant. Thus,&#13;

h  = -1.29          SSR/106        = 0.6189&#13;
When the intertemporal price effect is eliminated, the result is the&#13;
preferred equation, (7.2.1), of Table 7.2.   In this case, however, there&#13;
is nothing   to choose between    the dynamic linear equation embodying&#13;
serial correlation   (SER = 195.3) and     that embodying just a lagged&#13;
dependent variable   (SER     200.0).    For simplicity, we    choose  the&#13;
latter.   In real terms, these results are repeated, resulting in the&#13;
preferred real equation (7.2.2).&#13;
Again mirroring Malaysia, investment relative to wealth proves&#13;
to be the best disequilibrium variable, but here it is preferable to use&#13;
it as a factor in the estimate of wealth (equation [4.24]), rather than&#13;
using it as part of the discount rate (equation [4.161). The resulting&#13;
equations,   nominal   and   real,   appear   as   (7.2.3)  and   (7.2.4),&#13;
respectively.   For nominal imports, the two additional disequilibrium&#13;
variables are not statistically significant at 5 percent (with an F-&#13;
statistic of 2.19 compared with a critical       value of 3.64), but for&#13;
real imports they are (F = 5.04). Observe, however, that in terms of&#13;

nominal   fit,  the    real   equilibrium  equation   still  dominates   its&#13;
disequilibrium rival and that the latter displays significant negative&#13;
serial correlation. This last equation, (7.2.4), implies that a rise of&#13;
10 percent in the investment/wealth ratio from its mean of 0.171 to&#13;
0.188 will raise the estimate of wealth by 7.4 percent in 1980 and long-&#13;
run real imports by $534 million in 1980 dollars.&#13;
Kenya&#13;
Kenya presents a slightly different picture from the other two&#13;
countries.   The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is stronger&#13;
(nearly signficantly above unity at 5 percent), while no dynamics are&#13;
evident. Thus, for example,&#13;
Mt = (1 - 0.846nt 0.200) w    + 0.030 M                     (7.3)&#13;

h  = -0.82          SSR/106         = 0.1818&#13;
While   the  coefficient   on  intertemporal  prices   is  not  significant&#13;
(critical value t16[5%] -    + 2.112,   2-tail), it is sufficiently well-&#13;
determined to be retained in the equation, given our theoretical&#13;
interest in its effect.    1/   Thus the preferred equation is the basic&#13;
equation (4.14), which is reported as (7.3.1) in Table 7.3.           Almost&#13;
identical results with real imports lead to a preferred equation (7.3.2)&#13;
for the real wealth model.&#13;
1/  Estimating   a  considerably   reduces   the  standard   error  of   the&#13;
equation.    In  this  sense,  the actual estimate      is better than&#13;
imposing   (a = 1),  even though the latter cannot quite be rejected&#13;
at 5 percent.&#13;

The disequilibrium wealth results for Kenya match those for&#13;
Colombia almost precisely.    The investment/wealth ratio as a component&#13;
of wealth is the best of the disequilibrium terms, although in this&#13;
case, the additional terms are significant in neither the nominal model&#13;
(F-statistic   =  1.05)  nor   the  real  model   (F-statistic   =  2.65).&#13;
Nonetheless, we report some preferred disequilibrium models in Table&#13;
7.3.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Despite their obvious differences, these three countries tell a&#13;
fairly consistent story about the foreign wealth model.      For example,&#13;
all suggest that a Cobb-Douglas intertemporal utility function is an&#13;
acceptable approximation, all generate identical functional forms for&#13;
real and nominal imports, and all find the investment/wealth ratio the&#13;
best of the disequilibrium terms.&#13;
Even the differences among the countries have a degree of&#13;
consistency. For example, Kenya -- the poorest country by a long way --&#13;
shows no signs of either smoothing imports from year to year or of&#13;
responding to disequilibrium shocks such as investment booms. Colombia,&#13;
on the other hand, clearly smooths imports but is ambiguous about&#13;
disequilibrium, while Malaysia - the richest country -- displays both&#13;
smoothing and the ability to respond to disequilibrium.        A possible&#13;
explanation of this pattern is that poorer countries have neither the&#13;
wealth nor income to permit either smoothing or responses to investment&#13;
booms, although this explanation seems more likely in a constrained&#13;
borrowing framework than in our assumed world of perfect capital&#13;
markets.   A further consistency among countries is that the long-run&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
share of imports in wealth falls with increasing affluence, from 16&#13;
percent for Kenya through 14.3 percent for Colombia to 9.9 percent for&#13;
Malaysia (in the equilibrium real models).      As is clear from equation&#13;
(4.14), if the intertemporal price effects are ignored, this share is a&#13;
measure of the rate of time discount, and the result suggests that&#13;
poorer countries have shorter horizons, an entirely plausible view.&#13;
We have, therefore, a reasonable amount of corroboration for&#13;
the wealth model.      True,  there are some rejections     of the implied&#13;
hypothesis that all forms of wealth affect imports similarly, and doubts&#13;
arise from the data's preference for a constant rate of interest and the&#13;
need, in some cases, to relate imports to investment. Nevertheless, the&#13;
model appears to perform reasonably well overall.         It fits well, it&#13;
generates fairly clean residuals, it is plausible and it is consistent&#13;
across countries.&#13;
There are, however, two further sets of tests to conduct:&#13;
first, to see if this model can outperform others in explaining the same&#13;
data, and second, tests of structural stability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VIII. OTHER MODELS&#13;
In this section we introduce estimates of three other models:&#13;
the domestic wealth model, discussed already, and two strawmen against&#13;
which  to  test   our wealth   models.    A necessary   condition   for  the&#13;
acceptability of a new model is that, broadly speaking, it outperform&#13;
existing alternatives.    The alternatives considered here are, first, a&#13;
traditional model relating imports to GDP and relative domestic and&#13;
import prices, and, second, the Hemphill model that relates imports to&#13;
foreign exchange receipts and the stock of debt.     The section concludes&#13;
with tests of the structural stability of all the preferred equations in&#13;
Tables 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.&#13;
The Domestic Models&#13;
The domestic models are not subjected to such vigorous testing&#13;
as the foreign model.      Given their small    size relative   to the net&#13;
present value of GNP, it seems unnecessary to test whether different&#13;
components of wealth have the same effects as GNP or whether the timing&#13;
of loans is important.     Thus, we use only one wealth concept and test&#13;
versions of two models.      The Sachs model is represented by equation&#13;
(5.2),    but     with   the     non-wealth    terms     summarized     into&#13;
a [log(GNP/GNP) + log p GDP,    which is the deviation of real GDP from&#13;
its  exponential   trend,   GNP,   converted  into   current  prices.    The&#13;
Dornbusch model is represented by equation (5.6).     The interest rate and&#13;
stock of debt experiments are repeated, and each model is subjected to&#13;
the various dynamic specification tests.      For the comparisons between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
models, we select four equations covering real and nominal imports and&#13;
equilibrium and disequilibrium forms.&#13;
Before discussing the country results, certain generalizations&#13;
should be made.   First, the preference for a constant rate of interest&#13;
is repeated.   Second, these models prove very much harder to estimate&#13;
than the foreign wealth models, in part because they contain more&#13;
parameters.    Frequently,   it  is  impossible  to achieve   satisfactory&#13;
convergence  in  the   non-linear  forms,  and,  universally,   the  final&#13;
convergences are very sensitive to small changes in specifications.&#13;
This problem alone is a serious handicap in applying the models. There&#13;
are also, however, substantially more problems with plausibility than&#13;
previously.  1/   We never achieve a converged plausible disequilibrium&#13;
equation for real imports.     Third, the stock of debt variables never&#13;
prove useful.   Fourth, the investment/wealth ratio again usually proves&#13;
to be the most successful of the disequilibrium measures. Finally, the&#13;
Dornbusch formulation far outperforms the Sachs formulation.&#13;
For Malaysia, only nominal imports can be satisfactorily&#13;
explained by the domestic models.    The Sachs version of the equilibrium&#13;
model has plausible short-run coefficients, but because of a very high&#13;
coefficient on lagged imports, it is not acceptable in the long run.&#13;
The   Dornbusch   model,  which   with   lagged   imports  contains   five&#13;
coefficients, requires several constraints to be estimable at all; in&#13;
its logarithmic transformation some progress is possible, however, and&#13;
it results in the preferred equation (7.1.5).    This equation constrains&#13;
1/  For   these  reasons,   the  term  "preferred   equation"   should  be&#13;
interpreted very loosely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
the coefficient on wealth to unity, which implies the short-run&#13;
proportionality between imports and wealth. Over the long run, however,&#13;
imports rise by 1.18 percent for every 1 percent rise in wealth, which&#13;
is clearly inconsistent with the model theoretically.         On the other&#13;
hand, the constraint is demanded most strongly statistically: imposing&#13;
long-run rather than short-run proportionality increases the SER by over&#13;
50 percent.    No other equation approaches the preferred equation in&#13;
terms of fit, and so we use the latter in the model comparisons, despite&#13;
its theoretical shortcomings.&#13;
In the disequilibrium experiments, convergence is very erratic,&#13;
given the large number of coefficients, and it is necessary to replace&#13;
the constant of equation (5.6) by the base-year imports/GNP ratio.&#13;
(This is a normal practice in CES allocation functions; see Hickman and&#13;
Lau, 1973).    Nonetheless, a statistically respectable equation emerges&#13;
(7.1.7), in which higher investment is associated with greater rates of&#13;
time discount. It is a constrained version of the Dornbusch model. The&#13;
Sachs model never converges.&#13;
The Sachs model encounters severe problems with the Colombian&#13;
data:   it either fails to converge or suggests negative rates of time&#13;
discount.    The Dornbusch model fares better but, as before, requires&#13;
several   constraints.    The   final  equation   (7.2.5)  shows  no   auto-&#13;
regression, but strong contemporaneous substitution between imports and&#13;
domestic goods.     Even stronger   restrictions   are necessary for real&#13;
imports.   Again, it proves impossible to estimate the constant, and no&#13;
remotely  significant   effects   can  be  found   for  contemporaneous   or&#13;
intertemporal prices, or for lagged imports.     Thus, ultimately, imports&#13;
are expressed as a proportion of total wealth (see equation [7.2.6]).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
The   estimation   problems  are   compounded   in  the   domestic&#13;
disequilibrium models; indeed, little consistency can be found in the&#13;
results.   The preferred equation,    (7.2.6), appears highly desirable,&#13;
with   investment   increasing  the   rate  of   time  discount   and  with&#13;
significant contemporaneous and intertemporal price effects.      It is not&#13;
robust, however, and neither the difference between equations (7.2.6)&#13;
and (7.2.4), nor the single disequilibrium coefficient on (I/WD), is&#13;
statistically significant.&#13;
Kenya's nominal domestic models behave similarly to those of&#13;
the other two countries.    The Sachs model proves numerically unstable,&#13;
while the logarithmic transformation of the Dornbusch model provides the&#13;
best fit and most robust estimates.    In this case, contemporaneous price&#13;
effects are detected (they imply an import price elasticity of between 0&#13;
and -1), and the long-run proportionality of imports and wealth is&#13;
acceptable.&#13;
In the disequilibrium models, only the Dornbusch model is&#13;
viable.     Surprisingly,   the  growth   rate  of  GDP   proves  a   better&#13;
disequilibrium indicator than does the investment/wealth ratio.        It is&#13;
acceptable either as part of the wealth calculation or in its preferred&#13;
form, where it positively affects the rate of time discount.         Again,&#13;
while the equation looks good, the estimates are rather sensitive to&#13;
small changes in specification.&#13;
The Kenyan real domestic wealth model reverses all previous&#13;
trends. Here the Sachs model fits better than the Dornbusch equations,&#13;
and the most general equation is accepted.      It implies that higher GNP&#13;
produces higher imports, which is contrary to Sachs' prediction, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
this outcome does not seem so implausible as to require rejection of the&#13;
model.&#13;
The Traditional Model&#13;
The traditional model is the first of our strawmen.          It is&#13;
introduced solely as a foil to the wealth models and receives no&#13;
research effort. The estimating equation is&#13;
M&#13;
M = a + a1 GDP + a2(     GDP )     a3 M-1                   (8.1)&#13;
p&#13;
which is estimated in nominal and real terms, with and without a lagged&#13;
dependent variable, and in linear and log-linear forms -- eight attempts&#13;
altogether.   The economic coefficients are constrained to zero only in&#13;
the cause of plausibility, while the lagged dependent variable is&#13;
retained only where it is significant.     The choice between logarithmic&#13;
and linear forms is made using the criteria of error whiteness and fit.&#13;
The reported preferred equations, numbered 9 and 10 in the tables,&#13;
require no comment, save that in this model, in keeping with tradition&#13;
but not with our treatment of the domestic wealth models, we deflate GDP&#13;
by its own deflator in the real equations rather than by import prices.&#13;
The Hemphill Model&#13;
The Hemphill model was discussed briefly in Sectio.p II, but it&#13;
is useful to review its features here. 1/     We start with the balance of&#13;
payments identity,&#13;
1/ Greater detail is available in Winters and Yu (1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
F = M + AR,&#13;
where F = Exogenous (net) foreign exchange receipts&#13;
M = Total import expenditures and&#13;
AR = The change in the stock of foreign assets.&#13;
Hemphill models the allocation of given funds, F, between spending, M,&#13;
and  savings,   AR,   both  of which are    endogenous.    His  estimating&#13;
equation is&#13;
t =a + a1 Rt + a2Ft + a3 AF                               (8.2)&#13;
where   RI  is the   stock of   foreign assets  at the   beginning of year&#13;
t                              t-1          t - 1&#13;
t    and    is  cumulated    as   Rt =       AR. =     X   (F. - M.).    We&#13;
j   0   :     j0           J&#13;
expect  a1 &gt; 0 -- that is,    higher  reserves  (lower  indebtness)   means&#13;
higher imports.&#13;
Hemphill experiments with several different allocations of&#13;
balance of payments items between the exogenous F and endogenous AR&#13;
elements of his model. We cannot replicate his measures, but experiment&#13;
ourselves with three different definitions, as follows:&#13;
Definition of F                  Definition of   AR&#13;
(1) Narrow      Current credits including        All capital items&#13;
transfers&#13;
(2) Official    (1) plus net long- and           Monetary items plus&#13;
medium-term official             long-term private and&#13;
borrowing                        total short-term capital&#13;
(3) Basic      (2) plus net long- and            Monetary items and short-&#13;
medium-term private              term capital&#13;
borrowing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
As before, the equations are estimated in real and nominal&#13;
terms, with and without a lagged dependent variable -- a total of 12&#13;
estimates in all. Coefficients on net foreign exchange earnings, F, and&#13;
the stock of debt,     R',  are  retained  whenever  plausible,  while   the&#13;
dynamic terms   AF and M1    are kept only when significant.     The choice&#13;
between the three definitions of F and R' is made by reference to fit&#13;
and  error  behavior,   and  in  every  case   the  "basic"  definition   is&#13;
favored.   This concept of exogenous foreign exchange receipts is the&#13;
broadest and takes us some way toward estimating the balance of payments&#13;
identity that, the current account balance (X - M) is equal and opposite&#13;
to the sum-of the capital account balances.       The latter comprise net&#13;
long-term capital (F - X), short-term capital and official finance, and&#13;
there is sufficient variation in the last two components to give us some&#13;
confidence that our equations reflect actual behavior rather than mere&#13;
accounting.   (The ratio of the sample standard deviations of short-term&#13;
capital plus official financing flows to that of imports is 12.4&#13;
percent, 23.0 percent and 21.0 percent for Malaysia, Colombia and Kenya,&#13;
respectively.)&#13;
Three general observations should be made about the preferred&#13;
equations,  numbered   11 and   12 in  the  tables.    First,  in the real&#13;
equations, every variable, including the constant, is deflated by the&#13;
import   price.     This  approach   seems   correct   theoretically   (debt&#13;
accumulates in nominal terms) and is vindicated empirically in the case&#13;
of Malaysia, for which it is tested.     Second, the real equations always&#13;
fit better than the nominal ones.      Third, each equation requires one,&#13;
but only one, of the dynamic terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-&#13;
The estimated Hemphill equation is a reduced form, and while&#13;
the   structural   form   cannot   be   estimated   because   it   involves&#13;
unobservables, the structural parameters are identifiable. Fortunately,&#13;
they  seem   fairly  plausible   for  all   three  countries.     The  most&#13;
contentious implied structural parameter is the marginal increment in&#13;
the desired stock of reserves and short-term assets with respect to an&#13;
increase in long-term foreign exchange receipts; these are 0.41, 0.38&#13;
and 0.11   for Malaysia,   Colombia  and Kenya,   respectively.     All are&#13;
positive, suggesting that as wealth rises, countries prefer to have&#13;
higher short-term assets rather than higher short-term debts; they are&#13;
related to income -- richer countries like higher reserves; and they are&#13;
not wildly different from previous estimates of the reserve/import&#13;
relationship.&#13;
Structural Stability&#13;
Clearly, a good model must display stable estimates as the&#13;
sample period varies. Therefore, we conclude this section by conducting&#13;
some limited stability tests of the preferred equations of Tables 7.1,&#13;
7.2 and 7.3.   We use all our data in estimating the various models, so&#13;
that independent forecasting results are not possible.      We do, however,&#13;
conduct two sets of in-sample tests, which are at least indicative.&#13;
First, we experiment with Brown, Durbin and Evans' CUSUM and CUSUMSQ&#13;
tests.    Unfortunately,  our sample is    too small  to yield meaningful&#13;
results: in line with the findings of other researchers using small&#13;
samples, the CUSUM test never rejects the null hypothesis of stability,&#13;
while the CUSUMSQ always does.     We thus place little reliance on these&#13;
tests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-&#13;
The second batch of tests are merely Chow tests conducted on&#13;
various in-sample years.     lie separately test 3 years to see if they&#13;
conform to the model explaining the remaining 17.      The three years are&#13;
1965, which as the end point of the sample is likely to be the most&#13;
sensitive indicator of functional misspecification; 1974, the most&#13;
turbulent year of the sample period; and 1982, an end year also subject&#13;
to large shocks.    The results are reported in Table 8.1.       Each model&#13;
receives at least one rejection, and these tend to be concentrated in&#13;
the later of the years.     On the whole, the tests of stability reflect&#13;
the other properties of the equations -- the better performing equations&#13;
tend to show less instability.&#13;
These results are not perfect -- ideally we want no instability&#13;
-- but, on the other hand, neither are they indicative of serious and&#13;
widespread problems, at least among the stronger models (see the next&#13;
section).&#13;

IX. COMPARING THE MODELS&#13;
Having identified a preferred real and a preferred          nominal&#13;
equation from each model, we now test them against each other, using,&#13;
for ease of computation, Davidson and MacKinnon's (1981) P-tests.        For&#13;
non-tested hypotheses, if we have two models of process y,&#13;
HO   Yt    f (Xti   +   ot                                   (9.1)&#13;
and&#13;
H:yt      g(Z   Y) +   t                                     (9.2)&#13;
1           ti       it&#13;
then we can test the truth of    Ho  by seeing whether   H    can contribute&#13;
to the explanation of y in addition to the factors in       H   .   The test&#13;
statistic is derived from the equation&#13;
^   ^   ^       ~~k aft&#13;
(y  - f       ag  -          k    -f                         (9.3)&#13;
fY f) = c(gt     f f) + i~    . 1 a.i  + 1'(93&#13;
t    t        t    t           To 8   i  :1&#13;
where   ft and gt   are fitted values under    Ho   and  H1,   respectively,&#13;
the  (-a-)   are derived from equation (9.1), and the    (8k)   are nuisance&#13;
parameters of no intrinsic interest.       This equation asks whether the&#13;
estimated residuals of    Ho, (y - f),   are related at all to the factors&#13;
appearing in   H1   but not in   Ho0 (g - f).    The second set of terms in&#13;
equation (9.3) appears only to correct for any correlations between the&#13;
latter and the elements already included in      Ho.   If  H0   is true, the&#13;
elements   in  H  but not   in  H0  add nothing to the explanation, and so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
a = 0.  Any other value of    a  suggests that   Ho   is incorrect and thus&#13;
rejects  it.   Davidson and MacKinnon show that       a  is asymptotically&#13;
distributed as N(0,1), under the null hypothesis that     Ho  is true.&#13;
The test is not symmetric, for    a = 1  does not prove that   HI&#13;
is true.   For that, it is necessary to repeat the test with    Ho and   HI&#13;
reversed.    Davidson  and  MacKinnon   show  that   several  alternatives,&#13;
y = g.(),   can be tested simultaneously by replacing the first term on&#13;
m&#13;
the right of equation (9-3) by           a 1   (gjt -t)&#13;
A drawback of this test is that it assumes that y is always the&#13;
dependent variable, whereas in our case we might actually have any or&#13;
all  of   M,   /M, log (M) or log ( / M) as    dependent   variables.     We&#13;
p                      p&#13;
have evaded this issue by always converting g to the units in which&#13;
f is measured. For the deflation by p , this approach is unlikely to&#13;
be flawed, for   pM   is exogenous, and we are basically just reversing a&#13;
heteroskedasticity transformation.     For the logarithmic transformation,&#13;
however, it is potentially serious, and we merely plead that it is not&#13;
obviously actually so.&#13;
(Since we completed this work, we have noted that MacKinnon,&#13;
White and Davidson, 1983, have addressed this problem of the P-test.&#13;
They suggest using equation [9.3] but with f converted into the units&#13;
in which    g   is measured.     While this    PE-test   has  few desirable&#13;
properties in theory, the authors claim it is of considerable practical&#13;
use.   It is not clear how it compares with our procedure,         although&#13;
intuitively we might expect ours to lead to fewer rejections, since in&#13;
our case,   HI meets   Ho  on   H 's  own ground.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The models are compared in Tables 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.          These&#13;
tables report both the standard errors of the various equations in terms&#13;
of their fit to nominal imports and the results of the non-nested&#13;
tests.    Taking  Malaysia   first,  it  is  plain  that  the  two  nominal&#13;
disequilibrium models are the best-fitting, followed by the real models&#13;
in general. The equilibrium wealth models fare very badly.&#13;
This pattern of preference is largely borne out by the non-&#13;
nested  tests.    Reading   along  each  row  of  the  matrix  shows  which&#13;
alternative models reject a particular null; the columns show which&#13;
nulls a particular alternative rejects.     Thus, for Malaysia, we observe&#13;
a general tendency for the real models to reject the nominal ones (in&#13;
the top right quandrant) and not to be rejected by them (bottom left).&#13;
Against this result, however, the nominal foreign disequilibrium wealth&#13;
model (7.3.2) rejects all other models and is rejected by none of&#13;
them. This finding is powerful, and it is reinforced by noting that in&#13;
Table 8.1, the foreign disequilibrium wealth model is one of the only&#13;
two models not to display any structural instability.&#13;
If we were to put this model aside, however, because of its&#13;
suspected simultaneity problem or because of the difficulties of&#13;
projecting investment, then among the remaining equations, the real&#13;
Hemphill one has similarly persuasive results.        Observe how, in this&#13;
case, the Hemphill model rejects the nominal domestic disequilbrium&#13;
formulation and is not rejected by it, despite the latter's superior&#13;
fit.&#13;
The predominant reason for the differences in fit between the&#13;
disequilibrium wealth models and most of the other models concerns the&#13;
former's ability to predict the continuing strong growth of imports in&#13;
&#13;

1982.    This  growth   occurred  despite  decelerating   foreign  exchange&#13;
inflows, but coincided with a strong expansion of domestic investment.&#13;
It is also interesting to note the relatively poor performance&#13;
of the equilibrium wealth models.      A priori, Malaysia looked a rather&#13;
good candidate for this approach to imports, for the responses to the&#13;
discovery and development of oil typically would appear to be "forward-&#13;
looking."    Wealth,  and  thus expenditures,   rose well before    the oil&#13;
resources came on-stream to boost exports or GDP. Capturing this effect&#13;
is precisely the novelty of this type of model.      Two observations might&#13;
be made: first, we may be modelling oil expectations wrongly; second,&#13;
the processes may be as postulated, but because the investment in the&#13;
oil industry is financed by borrowing from abroad, the associated rise&#13;
in foreign exchange receipts, which drives the Hemphill model, may&#13;
reflect the imports of oil equipment more faithfully than does our&#13;
imperfect wealth measure. Note, again, how we return to the interaction&#13;
between imports and investment.&#13;
The discrimination among models is weaker for Colombia. Nearly&#13;
all models can generate an equation with a standard error of around $200&#13;
million, and there are fewer rejections in general.        Nonetheless, the&#13;
nominal foreign disequilibrium model again sweeps the board, rejecting&#13;
all models and being rejected by none.&#13;
There are two caveats to this result, however.         First,  the&#13;
model shows signs of structural instability in Table 8.1. Second, while&#13;
by   Davidson  and   MacKinnon's   P-test   it   rejects   its  equilibrium&#13;
counterpart, it does not do so in the nested F-test that can also be&#13;
made between these two models.     Since the former is only an asymptotic&#13;
test, while the latter is correct in small samples, we should really&#13;

simplify the disequilibrium model to its equilibrium form. However, in&#13;
this form, which is analyzed in row 2 and column 2 of the matrix in&#13;
Table 9.2, the wealth model is rejected by two models and rejects none.&#13;
Part of the reason for the greater ambiguity with Colombia is&#13;
presumably that, in the absence of a large and obviously forward-looking&#13;
component   of   wealth   such   as   oil,   there  is   less   statistical&#13;
discrimination between the foreign wealth and the foreign exchange&#13;
receipts series.    Further, Colombia is known to have had considerable&#13;
illicit exports of narcotics at times.     These presumably boost imports&#13;
without appearing anywhere in our explanatory variables.      If this trade&#13;
fluctuated significantly, it could entirely swamp the "legal" component&#13;
of trade that we can model.&#13;
Kenya exhibits a wider range of fit than Colombia and more&#13;
model rejections.    There is no general preference between the real and&#13;
nominal models.     The strongest model appears     to be Hemphill's    real&#13;
equation, which rejects all alternatives and is rejected by none.&#13;
Following it are the 'two nominal disequilibrium models.         The Kenyan&#13;
models show greater structural stability than the other countries'.&#13;
This outcome partly reflects the fact that the in-sample fits     (R 2)  for&#13;
Kenya are worse.     Thus, a given percentage prediction error is more&#13;
likely to be within the range experienced over the sample period.        The&#13;
only instabilities detected for Kenya are for 1974, and they arise from&#13;
the severe underprediction of import expenditures as the oil-price rose:&#13;
the share of fuels in Kenya's imports rose from 10.9 percent in 1973 to&#13;
22.4 percent in 1974.     Although not always statistically significant,&#13;
this problem afflicts all the Kenyan models.&#13;

It is interesting that Kenya -- the poorest country of our&#13;
sample and the one least attractive to lenders -- favors the model which&#13;
assumes capital market imperfections, while Malaysia -- the richest and,&#13;
with oil, ostensibly the most attractive -- favors the perfect capital&#13;
(or unrestricted borrowing) assumption.&#13;
The upshot of these tests is that, of all the models, the&#13;
nominal foreign disequilibrium wealth model and the real Hemphill model&#13;
appear to be the best.    In both Malaysia and Kenya, they constitute the&#13;
optimal pair, while in Colombia the results are ambiguous.       There are,&#13;
however, possible simultaneous biases in both these models that caution&#13;
against   too   uncritical   an   acceptance   of   the   rankings.      The&#13;
disequilibrium   model   faces   a  possible   link  between   imports   and&#13;
investment, while both models would be confounded by the endogeneity of&#13;
exports.   We rate the latter as the smaller danger, both absolutely and&#13;
in terms of the damage that ignored correlations would do to the&#13;
estimates.&#13;
We tentatively conclude that foreign exchange-based models of&#13;
imports dominate GDP-based ones.     It is clear that the domestic models&#13;
need more attention before they can be applied, although it should be&#13;
recalled that we simplified Sach's version even before estimation. The&#13;
traditional model, while among the leaders for Colombia, does not in&#13;
general perform well.&#13;
In economic terms, the models chosen here suggest a strong and&#13;
direct link between financial variables and developing countries'&#13;
imports.   The Hemphill model suggests     that, subject to some damping&#13;
through changes in short-term debt, any shock to net foreign exchange&#13;
receipts will produce a corresponding change in import expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-&#13;
This pattern is equally true for changes in export earnings, long-term&#13;
borrowing or interest    payments.    The intertemporal models suggest a&#13;
similar story. They indicate a degree smoothing to the import path, and&#13;
in the disequilibrium form admit a role for investment booms, but&#13;
otherwise changes in revenue get translated directly into changes in&#13;
imports.    The absence of strong intertemporal price effects renders&#13;
changes in wealth the principal determinant of imports, and these&#13;
changes in turn are driven primarily by current account receipts and the&#13;
interest  rate.    Thus,  according   to  this model,   imports  have   been&#13;
curtailed over the eighties both by weak export markets and high&#13;
interest rates.&#13;
It is not appropriate here to make forecasts (even of past&#13;
years), but the results of this paper suggest most strongly that greater&#13;
exports to developing countries will not be a significant engine of&#13;
recovery for the OECD in the near future.      Indeed, without significant&#13;
progress in at least some of the following directions -- lower interest&#13;
rates, stronger export markets, or freer borrowing and capital transfers&#13;
-- most developing countries' imports will remain rather stagnant for&#13;
several years.&#13;

X. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper explores four models of import determination for&#13;
each  of  three  developing   countries.    The   objectives  are  twofold.&#13;
Primarily we wish to explore the issue of financial variables in import&#13;
determination.     To  this  end,  we  develop   an  operational  model   of&#13;
intertemporal foreign exchange management, devoting considerable space&#13;
to its specification and measurement.      The model proves viable -- in&#13;
that an estimable form has been derived- -- and potentially quite&#13;
useful. For all three countries, it gives fairly plausible results, and&#13;
there  is a   strong  consistency   across  countries.    It  does  appear,&#13;
however, to require some modification to reflect disequilibrium factors&#13;
for at least one of the sample countries.&#13;
The model is compared with three others models of imports. One&#13;
applies the intertemporal analysis to total wealth rather than merely to&#13;
its foreign exchange component, while the other two relate imports to&#13;
flows of income- or to foreign exchange receipts.       In the case of one&#13;
country -- Malaysia -- the model developed here is dominant (although&#13;
the dominant form gives rise to some doubts about simultaneity bias.); in&#13;
another case -- Kenya -- it is dominated; while in the third -- Colombia&#13;
-- there is considerable ambiguity.&#13;
The second, intimately related, objective is to discover a&#13;
single, simple, robust import function for developing countries for use&#13;
in the World Bank's and OECD's global modelling activities. The choice&#13;
is essentially between the foreign disequilibrium wealth form and the&#13;
real Hemphill model. Neither is perfect, and each is subject to worries&#13;
about simultaneity.     Thus,  while  they might be preferable     to other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
approaches, we do not at present have sufficient information to&#13;
distinguish between them.    Future research should be devoted to this&#13;
distinction, a task that basically amounts to exploring the perfect&#13;
capital markets hypothesis of the model developed here.      On the other&#13;
hand, both approaches agree on the importance of financial variables in&#13;
developing   countries7  imports,   and  both   suggest  that   until  the&#13;
industrial countries can generate better marketing opportunities, as&#13;
well as higher capital transfers and lower interest rates, developing&#13;
countries' imports will remain rather stagnant.&#13;

APPENDIX: DATA AND DEFINITIONS&#13;
The principal data sources used in the study are:&#13;
o    International Financial Statistics&#13;
o    Balance of payments statistics and&#13;
o    The World Bank debt data bank.&#13;
The series for LIBOR, which is not published, was supplied&#13;
privately by the Bank for international settlements. Certain World Bank&#13;
debt data are also not published.&#13;
This appendix describes the sources and definitions of data&#13;
where these are not obvious from the text and the published material.&#13;
It starts with general definitions and then considers special features&#13;
of each country's data.&#13;
All data are measured in (converted into) US dollars.&#13;
General Definitions&#13;
Imports:    merchandise   (f.o.b.)  plus  shipment   plus  "other"&#13;
debits, i.e., total debits, less investment income and unrequited&#13;
transfers.&#13;
Import prices: unit value of merchandise imports.&#13;
Assets: reserves plus gold (valued at London gold price) less&#13;
net foreign liabilities of banks.&#13;
Exports: total credits less official grants and net unrequited&#13;
transfers.&#13;
Export prices: unit value of merchandise exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

National  interest   rates:   rate on borrowing    from financial&#13;
institutions.   This rate had to be extrapolated on the basis of the US&#13;
rates of interest for the years prior to 1965.&#13;
Price of domestic sales of domestic output:    GDP deflator.&#13;
Debt  and  lending:     all  medium  and  long-term   lending,  as&#13;
recorded by the World Bank's Debtor Recording System.      All stocks refer&#13;
to the beginning of the period.&#13;
Malaysia&#13;
Expected  Export  Receipts:    Two problems were evident here.&#13;
First, Malaysia became an oil exporter over our sample period.       Merely&#13;
extrapolating the rate of growth of export revenues seemed wholly&#13;
inadequate.    Therefore,   we  assumed  (1)  static  expectations   on oil&#13;
prices, and (2) that oil quantities could broadly be foreseen up to five&#13;
years in advance.   Three series of expectations were constructed on this&#13;
basis: one operating over 1965-69, one over 1970-77 (the switch to this&#13;
series occurred when the leap in actual exports of 1975-79 was deemed&#13;
anticipated), and one over 1978-82 (when the rise in exports in 1982-85&#13;
was deemed anticipated).     The series are shown graphically in Figure&#13;
A.1.    For example, we assumed     that the expectation in    1969 of oil&#13;
exports in 1970 was 45, whereas the expectation in 1970 for that year&#13;
was 110. The increases projected over 1983-85 are based on specialists'&#13;
advice, and the export peak in 1971 is dismissed as an aberration, being&#13;
balanced by abnormally high imports of oil.&#13;
The second problem concerned non-oil exports.       These grew so&#13;
fast throughout most of our sample period that extrapolating their&#13;
growth rate led to infinite wealth in most years. When these years were&#13;

adjusted as suggested on pages 30-31 of the text, the wealth series&#13;
proved highly volatile. We therefore chose to apply static expectations&#13;
to export revenues, measuring the net present value of exports as (X/r).&#13;
Expected import prices:   It was assumed that most import prices&#13;
were expected to grow in the long run at their average growth rate over&#13;
the last five years.    The price of oil, however, was assumed fixed in&#13;
nominal terms, as were all export prices.&#13;
Exports  and   imports:    For  technical   reasons,  imports  for&#13;
Malaysia include debits of unrequited transfers, while exports include&#13;
only credits. Experiments suggest that this treatment made no practical&#13;
difference  to the   results  from the treatment    specified above.      In&#13;
economic terms, our standard treatment implied that investment income&#13;
payments and unrequited transfers were prior claims on foreign exchange&#13;
revenues before imports could be obtained, whereas our "Malaysian"&#13;
treatment implies that only investment income was.&#13;
Colombia&#13;
Coffee exports:    Coffee exports are separated from non-coffee&#13;
exports   when  calculating   expectations.      Non-coffee   export   price&#13;
expectations are static, whereas the coffee export price expectation is&#13;
the average price for the previous five years.     Volume expectations are&#13;
static for both.&#13;
Non-commercial lending:    Our calculations required a series of&#13;
non-concessional disbursements to Colombia back to 1960. However, there&#13;
was no information for 1960, and we used half the value for 1961.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Kenya&#13;
Exports: Balance of payments data for Kenya begin in 1963, the&#13;
year Kenya gained    independence.    It is possible    to obtain data on&#13;
imports and exports of merchandise from the colonial reports.         These&#13;
data -are separated into external trade and trade within the East African&#13;
territory.    Data   on  trade  within  the  territory  are  likely   to  be&#13;
understated,   since   the  boundaries   of  the  three   territories  were&#13;
administered by a total of six customs posts. All pre-independence data&#13;
are customs data and are reported in East African pounds.        These were&#13;
converted to dollars and added to our sample.      We needed data on total&#13;
trade credits back to 1955, and these were estimated by extrapolating an&#13;
ordinary least squares regression of the exports of other goods and&#13;
services and net unrequited transfers (less grants) on merchandise&#13;
exports and a time trend fitted over 1964-82.&#13;
Exceptional finance:    Data for international capital flows and&#13;
unrequited transfers contain elements of exceptional financing. In the&#13;
latter class, these data are broken out because they are considered&#13;
accommodating. They are not so treated for loans, however, since loans&#13;
still entered the total stocks of debt.       This treatment implies that&#13;
Kenya could have expected to be able to borrow money without much&#13;
difficulty to cover its imports; thus such funds are included in the&#13;
import  decision.    On  the other hand,    grants,  being  costless,   were&#13;
probably more scarce and the country could not expect them. They would&#13;
be given after the import decision was made.&#13;
For most of the models, exceptional financing was treated like&#13;
any other capital flow.    However, for Hemphill's model we experimented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
by excluding exceptional financing from one version of the current&#13;
foreign exchange earnings and by adjusting reserves to take these grants&#13;
into account. There was little difference between the two versions.&#13;
Gold:   Kenya has very small gold holdings.       The data series&#13;
begins in 1973, with zero values recorded until 1977.        It was assumed&#13;
that gold holdings were non-existent prior to 1973.&#13;
Interest rates:    Data were needed back to 1955 for interest&#13;
rate expectations.   The value of 0.065 was used prior to independence.&#13;
For years missing data on what the financial institutions were charging&#13;
(1963, 1964, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1974), the average rate on non-&#13;
concessional loans was used.&#13;
Expectations:    Export  revenue expectations were adjusted to&#13;
take  into  account   price  fluctuations   for  tea  and  coffee.    Price&#13;
expectations for these beverage exports were taken as the five-year&#13;
averages of a composite price of the two goods. The composite price was&#13;
calculated with 1970 weights.&#13;

            Imports of developing countries : an
            empirical model of intertemporal allocation and financial constraints
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper specifies and estimates for
            three developing countries two intertemporal models of total
            imports. Imports are related alternatively to foreign
            exchange receipts and to GNP, with explicit account taken of
            expectations about the future values of these variables,
            future import prices and interest rates. Using non-nested
            hypothesis tests, the models are compared between themselves
            and with two other models of imports in the literature.
            While the results are not entirely satisfactory, they
            suggest that the intertemporal approach is quite promising.
            As this attempt is first to estimate an intertemporal model
            of international trade, considerable space is devoted to the
            operational specification of the theoretical models.
