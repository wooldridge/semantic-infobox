&#13;
                             follows the discussion of the legal memorandum on governance&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                             this paper for some time -- he is in the External Affairs&#13;

&#13;
                             we will have extensive discussion, no doubt.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Mr. Lateef.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. LATEEF:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Mr. Chairman, Members of the Board:       In these brief&#13;
&#13;
                             introductory remarks, I would like to stress three points.&#13;
&#13;
                                         First, governance has become a rather emotive word,&#13;
&#13;
                             and tends to mean different things to different people. As&#13;
&#13;
                             for what it means for the Bank, you will recall that the&#13;
&#13;
                             General Counsel's Legal Memorandum on Issues of Governance in&#13;
&#13;
                             Borrowing Members was discussed at a Board seminar on April&#13;

&amp;#12;                             11 this year.   Within this broad framework set out in that&#13;
&#13;
                             memorandum, the paper before you today attempts to describe&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank's operational interest in governance and it discusses&#13;
&#13;
                             approaches to Bank work which are consistent both with the&#13;
&#13;
                             institution's mandate to promote development and with the&#13;
&#13;
                             need to protect the Bank's reputation for technical excelÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             lence, professionalism, and objectivity.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Hence, the title "Managing Development:     The&#13;
&#13;
                             Governance Dimension".   As this title indicates, the paper&#13;
&#13;
                             has defined governance to mean "the manner in which power is&#13;
&#13;
                             exercised in the management of a country's economic and&#13;
&#13;
                             social resources for development".     The word is used throughÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             out the paper in this narrower sense, to make sure that it is&#13;
&#13;
                             widely understood that the Bank's interest in governance&#13;
&#13;
                             arises entirely from its concern for the effectiveness of the&#13;
&#13;
                             development efforts it supports.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Second, this is a discussion paper and, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
                             not intended to be prescriptive.     It is designed primarily to&#13;
&#13;
                             bring together the work going on in different parts of the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank on the governance dimension of development management&#13;
&#13;
                             and to set this work in a coherent framework.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It is intended to assist managers and staff to&#13;
&#13;
                             think more systematically about the three dimensions of&#13;

                             governance, apart from public sector management, the special&#13;
&#13;
                             focus of this paper:    economic and financial accountability,&#13;
&#13;
                             the legal framework for development, and the availability and&#13;
&#13;
                             t~ansparency   of information relevant to development.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Third, and following from the above, governance is&#13;
&#13;
                             not intended here as a new initiative for the Bank, either in&#13;
&#13;
                             terms of the areas of work defined or in terms of the way in&#13;
&#13;
                             which this issue is handled.    It is instead a reaffirmation&#13;
&#13;
                             of certain basic prerequisites for sound development manageÂ­&#13;

&#13;
                                       The central message of this paper is that efficient&#13;
&#13;
                             and accountable public sector management and the rules and&#13;
&#13;
                             institutions which create a predictable and transparent&#13;
&#13;
                             framework for the conduct of public and private business are&#13;
&#13;
                             critical to successful economic development. These key&#13;
&#13;
                             dimensions of governance help ensure the efficiency of both&#13;
&#13;
                             markets and of government interventions.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                             about the diversity of countries' experienced and problems.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The Bank needs to continue to learn in this area,&#13;

                                       I would first like to express the satisfaction with&#13;
&#13;
                             the continued discussion of governance, the framework of&#13;
&#13;
                             which was set by Mr. Shihata's memorandum discussed last&#13;

&#13;
                                       My constituent countries attach great importance to&#13;
&#13;
                             this consideration, and they have themselves been pursuing an&#13;

&#13;
                                       We strongly agree with the approach of a positive&#13;
&#13;
                             agenda taken in the report, indicating how the Bank through&#13;
&#13;
                             its regular operations and its dialogue with borrowers can&#13;
&#13;
                             promote improved governance practices.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We also welcome the country-specific approach which&#13;
&#13;
                             clearly recognizes the influence of cultural traditions and&#13;
&#13;
                             historical relationships, as well as the need for institutioÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             nal frameworks to mature.&#13;
&#13;
                                       In some other respects, we would have liked the&#13;
&#13;
                             report to go deeper than this in its analysis and 'farther in&#13;

&#13;
                             are given attention in the report. Considering the increasing&#13;
&#13;
                             understanding of the role and responsibilities of individuals&#13;
&#13;
                             in development and the emphasis on improving human resources&#13;
&#13;
                             and building institutions, this attention might have been&#13;
&#13;
                             even stronger.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Much the same could be said about poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
                             It is given attention in the report, but hardly the attention&#13;
&#13;
                             it deserves considering the importance of good governance in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                       As regards the role of the Bank, in particular, we&#13;
&#13;
                             would like to make the following comments.&#13;
&#13;
                                       First, we are in general agreement with a measured&#13;
&#13;
                             and selective approach, implemented through dialogue and&#13;
&#13;
                             appropriately designed country strategies. We agree that&#13;
&#13;
                             there is not a need for launching new special initiatives at&#13;
&#13;
                             the present time.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Second, we find the application of long-term views&#13;
&#13;
                             presented in paragraph 71 of particular interest and worthy&#13;
&#13;
                             of further elaboration. This includes the pursuit of good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance objectives through investment operations and long-&#13;
&#13;
                             term technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Third, we would like strongly to urge a strong&#13;
&#13;
                             collaboration with other relevant agencies, not least U.N.&#13;
&#13;
                             organizations.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, we believe that the attention to the&#13;
&#13;
                             governance issue should be kept alive now more than ever.        We&#13;
&#13;
                             would, therefore, welcome its further consideration in this&#13;
&#13;
                             Board in due course. We realize that this should not be done&#13;
&#13;
                             until further evolution has taken place and the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
                             gained additional experience.&#13;
&#13;
                                       But, we would be surprised, considering how fast&#13;

                                        MR. LANDAU:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Mr. Chairman, there are mainly three reasons for&#13;
&#13;
                              this institution to take governance into account in its&#13;
&#13;
                              reflection and maybe some parts of its action.&#13;
&#13;
                                        First, it is a notion which is relevant for&#13;
&#13;
                              development.   Past experience and history have provided, in&#13;
&#13;
                              our view, sufficient evidence that economic growth and social&#13;
&#13;
                              welfare need a predictable environment under which the action&#13;
&#13;
                              of the authorities, whatever their level and the form of the&#13;
&#13;
                              political government, can be reasonably anticipated within&#13;
&#13;
                              the framework of rules and sanctions.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Second, it is on the agenda of all the actors of&#13;
&#13;
                              international development.   As rightly pointed out by the&#13;
&#13;
                              paper, the issue is now surfacing increasingly at Consultativ&#13;
&#13;
                              Group meetings and in other international fora as well.      If&#13;
&#13;
                              the Bank did not set its own view, it would run the risk of&#13;
&#13;
                              simply having to follow other people of other institution's&#13;
&#13;
                              agenda, which would be a paradox for an institution endowed&#13;
&#13;
                              with such research and thinking capability.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, it is also along the line of previous work&#13;
&#13;
                             by the Bank on institutional conditions for good project&#13;
&#13;
                             management, and this again is made very clear in the paper.&#13;
&#13;
                                       So, Mr. Chairman, we fully share the   app~oach   and&#13;
&#13;
                             definition of governance which is given in the Task Force&#13;
&#13;
                             report.   In our view, the staff has wisely kept to what is&#13;
&#13;
                             essential and non-controversial definition of governance and,&#13;
&#13;
                             as such, has built upon the very thoughtful approach outlined&#13;
&#13;
                             previously by Mr. Shihata.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We fully share the view that the three concepts of&#13;
&#13;
                             rule of law, accountability and transparency are appropriate&#13;
&#13;
                             and constitute a good and comprehensive definition of&#13;
&#13;
                             governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The paper offers, nevertheless, new perspectives&#13;
&#13;
                             concerning both the role of the Bank in governance and the&#13;
&#13;
                             implications of governance for Bank practices.   On this let&#13;
&#13;
                             me make briefly the following five remarks:&#13;
&#13;
                                       First, the Task Force rightly insists on the limits&#13;
&#13;
                             inherent to the Bank's approach to governance, which are a&#13;
&#13;
                             consequence both of insufficient knowledge and insufficient&#13;
&#13;
                             resources. We strongly support the notion of selectivity and&#13;
&#13;
                             wish that the reflections and actions be concentrated on&#13;
&#13;
                             countries where there is a clear commitment and projects with&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             a good chance of success.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Second, the paper rightly points out the diversity&#13;
&#13;
                             of situation and historical and cultural backgrounds of&#13;
&#13;
                             borrower countries.    This,   ~n   our view, is absolutely&#13;
&#13;
                             essential to success. The challenge for the Bank is to use&#13;
&#13;
                             its multilateral nature to come out with a truly understandin&#13;
&#13;
                             and adaptable approach of the issue of governance for diverse&#13;
&#13;
                             and various countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Third, it is also wise to put the focus on a long-&#13;
&#13;
                             term perspective.     In many cases, institutions and practices&#13;
&#13;
                             are the product of long historical evolutions and cannot be&#13;
&#13;
                             changed overnight.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Four, it is also welcome that the Bank insist on&#13;
&#13;
                             the research aspect of the concept of governance. This, in&#13;
&#13;
                             our view, can be the most significant contribution the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             can make to the international partner in these fields,&#13;
&#13;
                             thereby avoiding the risk of tensions and over-simplificaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tions. And that might be a real risk in the present context&#13;
&#13;
                             when this issue is dealt with in other fora.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, Mr. Chairman, we welcome the fact that&#13;
&#13;
                             emphasis is put on the necessity to assist and persuade,&#13;
&#13;
                             rather than order and constrain.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Obviously, the most challenging and difficult part&#13;

&#13;
                             three simple remarks.&#13;
&#13;
                                       First, the paper gives the feeling that may be&#13;
&#13;
                             misleading, that Africa will be kind of delegated at the&#13;
&#13;
                             first field of application.     I think we can all agree that&#13;
&#13;
                             the program should be based on a broad-based area.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Second, to the extent that governance implies&#13;
&#13;
                             policy dialogue with borrower governments r this should be&#13;
&#13;
                             conducted at the proper level. And this is an issue which is&#13;
&#13;
                             alluded to in the report.     Governance is at this stage a&#13;
&#13;
                             confidence-building exercise on very sensitive issues.        It&#13;
&#13;
                             cannot certainly be treated as a routine business.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, Mr. Chairman, it is certainly welcome that&#13;
&#13;
                             governance concerns progressively permeate the reflection and&#13;
&#13;
                             research of the Bank.     It is also certainly good that it&#13;
&#13;
                             finds some specific implementation possibilities in relevant&#13;
&#13;
                             projects and countries.     But the approach should be kept low&#13;
&#13;
                             key and flexible.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The staff should certainly refrain from elaborating&#13;
&#13;
                             even in formal criteria or directive or guidelines in this&#13;
&#13;
                             field, and the Board should absolutely refrain from making&#13;
&#13;
                             governance a specific item, in this case IDA-country lending&#13;

&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, we welcome the opportunity to discuss&#13;
&#13;
                             once again this important subject. We appreciate the effort&#13;
&#13;
                             the staff has put into writing this sensitive paper, trying&#13;
&#13;
                             to accommodate all shades of view expressed in earlier&#13;
&#13;
                             discussions, while keeping always in mind the Bank concern&#13;
&#13;
                             for the effectiveness of the development effort it supports.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This attitude is shown all through the document, of&#13;
&#13;
                             objectivity in assessing the issue, showing an acute sense of&#13;
&#13;
                             its complexity and, hence, a realistic assessment of what is&#13;
&#13;
                             already being done to improve governance, of what could be&#13;
&#13;
                             done in the future and at what pace.     It is certainly&#13;
&#13;
                             reassuring.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This reassurance, Mr. Chairman, is very much&#13;
&#13;
                             needed.   It is very much needed because the whole subject of&#13;
&#13;
                             governance, as it relates to good and efficient economic&#13;
&#13;
                             performance carries a huge potential for mischief, an alibi&#13;
&#13;
                             that it could provide to all kinds of groups to meddle in our&#13;

                             project the lesson humility. The word "humility", Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Chairman, should be emphasized again and again so that it&#13;
&#13;
                             registers in the vocabulary and consciences of all staff at&#13;

                                          Mr. Chairman, while good governance in developing&#13;

                             nothing could be done in the name of this paper to exceed or&#13;

&#13;
                             the purpose stated in Article I."   We hold the Bank's mandate&#13;
&#13;
                             sacred in this discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, on capacity and efficiency issues in&#13;
&#13;
                             public sector management, we offer our overall support for&#13;
&#13;
                             the proposals made in the paper.    Our worry is that too much&#13;
&#13;
                             is being done too soon in the public sector, that we may be&#13;
&#13;
                             dissipating our efforts of a too broad an area. We need to be&#13;
&#13;
                             selective, judging by a thin layer of capable local managers&#13;
&#13;
                             who have to undertake and supervise the reforms.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The IMF in the recent paper scheduled to go to its&#13;
&#13;
                             Board in a review of its SAF, ESAF and ESAF Trust has this&#13;
&#13;
                             recommendation, which I believe is also appropriate here. In&#13;
&#13;
                             view of the generally limited administrative capacity of&#13;
&#13;
                             governments, a more selective approach, involving clearer&#13;
&#13;
                             prioritization of efforts, might be considered by first&#13;
&#13;
                             focusing on those few enterprises that have the most immediate&#13;
&#13;
                             and major impact on the macroeconomic situation.&#13;

                                       My other comment pertains to accountability and&#13;
&#13;
                             transparency as it relates to decision-making, monitoring of&#13;
&#13;
                             performance, both at central and decentralized local levels.&#13;
&#13;
                                       If our focus in this area is to help build instituÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tions, strengthen generally borrower capacity, not only at&#13;
&#13;
                             the central level but also at the local levels to create&#13;
&#13;
                             frameworks and programs like the Philippine Communal IrrigaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tion Program that helped to release the potential, raise the&#13;

&#13;
                             munities, then I am for it.&#13;
&#13;
                                       But if the scheme is only to open doors for all&#13;
&#13;
                             kinds of consultants' work and spending and less studies that&#13;
&#13;
                             are never implemented because of their technical complexities,&#13;
&#13;
                             lack of local inputs and support, then I would say this would&#13;
&#13;
                             be a wasted effort and time for all of us.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Let me add that the design of such programs must be&#13;
&#13;
                             done with understanding, sensitivity to local, political,&#13;

&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, I can endorse the statement in&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 38, that from the Bank's point of view, the rule of&#13;
&#13;
                             law is not an end in itself.      It is only to the extent that&#13;
&#13;
                             it establishes a'set of preconditions for development that it&#13;
&#13;
                             comes within the purview of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The question of information and transparency of the&#13;
&#13;
                             decision-making process is a broader and more sensitive issue&#13;
&#13;
                             than it is treated in this paper. The importance of informaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tion is not only the    opportuni~y   or the access one has to it.&#13;
&#13;
                             It involves also the capacity of the government, of private&#13;
&#13;
                             individuals to disseminate it, as well as the ability to&#13;
&#13;
                             grasp and analyze this.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This, in turn, rests on the level of education and&#13;
&#13;
                             the environment in which one finds himself. This is why this&#13;
&#13;
                             Chair continues to insist that the eradication of poverty and&#13;
&#13;
                             emphasis on the social sector should continue to be one of&#13;
&#13;
                             the key pillars of the Bank's lending.       I do not doubt for a&#13;

                            establishment of such a system is going to take time and&#13;
&#13;
                            effort and determination in borrowing countries, and a lot&#13;
&#13;
                            more patience, care and assistance from the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
                            donors' community.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I   also hope that on the question of the decision-&#13;
&#13;
                            making process, the whole issue will be framed with senÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                            sitivity because we maintain that the level of participation&#13;
&#13;
                            in decision-making has a lot of facets to it, ranging from&#13;
&#13;
                            not merely a chance to participate but how an individual sees&#13;
&#13;
                            his or her self-interest, as well as the minimum standards of&#13;
&#13;
                            living, that allows him or her the freedom and time to react&#13;
&#13;
                            to events and respond.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Mr. Chairman, as the issue of arms' expenditure is&#13;
&#13;
                            underlying in the paper, I would like to point out once again&#13;
&#13;
                            that the Bank is not qualified to determine what should be&#13;
&#13;
                            the right level of defense expenditures for a given country,&#13;
&#13;
                            as it cannot analyze for each case the underlying causes of&#13;
&#13;
                            conflict.&#13;

&#13;
                                       At any rate, this is not its mandate.      Hence, here&#13;
&#13;
                             again, we cannot but recommend great care and restraint in&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank judgment, if any.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, may   I   recapitulate a few of the main&#13;
&#13;
                             conditions that are now ruling the Bank's law.      Developing&#13;
&#13;
                             countries have to fight poverty, that is expand their social&#13;
&#13;
                             spending and improve their social institutions. But, at the&#13;
&#13;
                             same time, they should pursue their adjustment effort, which&#13;
&#13;
                             in most cases implies reduction in public spending.&#13;
&#13;
                                       They also have to improve the environment and now&#13;
&#13;
                             introduce a better and better governance. At the same time,&#13;
&#13;
                             while the phasing out of the adjustment loans is recommended&#13;
&#13;
                             somehow, it is underlying that investment projects could be&#13;
&#13;
                             beneficial only in the right economic environment.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Last but not least, the private sector development&#13;
&#13;
                             has becoming a standing parameter, even for countries where&#13;
&#13;
                             local private capital is limited and foreign private investÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ment remains a dream.&#13;
&#13;
                                       While all these conditions are relevant, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Chairman, we submit that they could be conflicting; hence,&#13;
&#13;
                             the continuing need for the Bank to find the right balance,&#13;
&#13;
                             in particular between the human sector development and the&#13;
&#13;
                             adjustment processes.&#13;

&#13;
                                       Let me just say straightaway I have listened very&#13;
&#13;
                             carefully to Mr. Benhocine, and I would hope that we can all&#13;
&#13;
                             endorse a great deal of what he had to say, in particular&#13;
&#13;
                             about the need for the Bank to exercise sensitivity in this&#13;
&#13;
                             area of its operations.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I think this is a very good paper, and I hope it&#13;
&#13;
                             will secure a wide degree of approval today. Given that at&#13;
&#13;
                             the end, in paragraph 77, it offers four specific proposals&#13;
&#13;
                             by management on the next steps, I wondered indeed whether it&#13;
&#13;
                             might be appropriate for it perhaps in some amended form to&#13;
&#13;
                             be presented in due course to the Board itself, rather than&#13;
&#13;
                             to the Committee of the Whole for endorsement or approval.       I&#13;

                             don't have very strong views on that, but I raise it in case&#13;

&#13;
                                          The paper strikes to me the right balance between,&#13;
&#13;
                             on the one hand, establishing a common understanding of what&#13;
&#13;
                             the issues are and how the Bank should deal with them and, on&#13;
&#13;
                             the other hand, the need to respect the non-political mandate&#13;
&#13;
                             of the institution.     It provides many practical examples with&#13;
&#13;
                             the way the Bank is already actively pursuing issues of&#13;
&#13;
                             governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The codification of relevant activities for the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank should, I think, be useful to Operations' staff and this&#13;
&#13;
                             should, in my view, be the main purpose of this paper in our&#13;
&#13;
                             discussion today; that is, to provide for the Bank staff a&#13;
&#13;
                             clearer understanding of the issues and the role they can or&#13;
&#13;
                             should play in governance issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Let me start with three points I particularly liked&#13;
&#13;
                             about the paper before turning to other comments.&#13;
&#13;
                                          First, I am sure the paper is right to avoid being&#13;
&#13;
                             too prescriptive.     I agree very much that different approaches&#13;
&#13;
                             will work with different countries, and we need to retain&#13;
&#13;
                             some flexibility.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Second, the paper I think fits well with some other&#13;
&#13;
                             papers we have discussed recently, for example, on private&#13;
&#13;
                             sector development or the latest World Development Report&#13;

&#13;
             "tJ&#13;
             ;,                       an enabling environment for the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Third, I like the recognition that change, when it&#13;
&#13;
                                      occurs, is most likely to succeed when it evolves within a&#13;
&#13;
                                      countrYr from within the society rather than being imposed&#13;
&#13;
                                      from outside.     The Bank certainly has a part of plaYr but not&#13;
&#13;
                                      in imposing change. The part the Bank has to play is in&#13;
&#13;
                                      persuading governments that it is in their interests to take&#13;
&#13;
                                      measures to improve aspects of governance when this would&#13;
&#13;
                                      improve the prospects for development.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   So, I think the Bank has an important role to play&#13;
&#13;
                                      in the governance debate.     The role is different from that of&#13;
&#13;
                                      bilateral donors r as has been noted many times r but it is not&#13;
&#13;
                                      entirely different. I think it will be artificial to draw too&#13;
&#13;
                                      sharp a distinction between the issues which are of interest&#13;
&#13;
                                      both to the Bank and bilateral donors, even though we should&#13;
&#13;
                                      certainly draw a line between areas where bilateral donors&#13;
&#13;
                                      may be involved but the Bank should not because of its nonÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                                      political mandate.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Turning to some other comments, I agree with Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                                      Haralz that the paper might have said more about poverty&#13;
&#13;
                                      reduction.    We have recently reaffirmed the Bank's commitment&#13;

                            to poverty reduction. And one aspect of good governance to me&#13;
&#13;
                            is ensuring fair treatment r including equal access to social&#13;
&#13;
                            services, and another is for governments to provide safety&#13;
&#13;
                            nets for the poorest members of their society.&#13;
&#13;
                                      So, the Bank's interest in governance should&#13;
&#13;
                            support and reinforce its objective of reducing and alleÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                            viating poverty.   I do, however, agree that it will be wrong&#13;

                            to make good governance by itself an area of special operaÂ­&#13;

&#13;
                            what the Bank does in all its activities.&#13;
&#13;
                                      There is another area where the paper I would have&#13;
&#13;
                            thought might have said more.   The sections on accountability&#13;
&#13;
                            and transparency deal at some length with the responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
                            of governments to spend money efficiently. But they do not&#13;
&#13;
                            refer at all to another essential element of the system,&#13;
&#13;
                            revenue collection.&#13;
&#13;
                                      A fair and transparent tax system not only ensures&#13;
&#13;

                                        One final general comment on the paper before&#13;
&#13;
                              turning to some specific points. The staff have to work with&#13;
&#13;
                              particular countries and operations.    I would not want to&#13;
&#13;
                              give them detailed guidance on this, but operational staff&#13;
&#13;
                              should be able to look for increasing technical support for&#13;
&#13;
                              their activities, as the Bank's research and information base&#13;
&#13;
                              in this area has improved.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I wonder, therefore, whether in commenting the&#13;
&#13;
                              staff might elaborate a little on management's proposals in&#13;
&#13;
                              paragraph 77. What, for example, is going to happen to the&#13;
&#13;
                              Task Force now that it has produced this paper?   Will it&#13;
&#13;
                              continue in some way to advise staff through seminars and so&#13;
&#13;
                              on, and to monitor progress?&#13;
&#13;
                                        Perhaps staff could also comment on the kind of&#13;
&#13;
                              staff who will be needed in the Bank for effective follow-up.&#13;
&#13;
                              Governance issues will create a demand for new skills, for&#13;
&#13;
                              example, in sociology and political science, which are not at&#13;
&#13;
                              present in strong supply in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Finally, let me touch on two particular issues of&#13;
&#13;
                              governance -- first of all, corruption; and secondly,&#13;
&#13;
                              military spending.&#13;

                             fair account of corruption and its negative effect on&#13;
&#13;
                             development and the development environment.     I agree that&#13;
&#13;
                             customs and procurement are particularly vulnerable areas&#13;
&#13;
                             here and one where Bank-supported assistance is contributing&#13;
&#13;
                             to improvements. These are also areas where bilateral donors&#13;
&#13;
                             can provide technical help.&#13;
&#13;
                                         I also agree very much that it takes two to agree&#13;
&#13;
                             on a corrupt deal.     I had made this point when we discussed&#13;
&#13;
                             Mr. Shihata's paper.    It is important that aid donors, as&#13;
&#13;
                             well as recipients, subject their practices to very careful&#13;
&#13;
                             scrutiny.    I was glad to note the reference in the paper to&#13;
&#13;
        ,&#13;
        \                    discussions going on in the DAC to try and improve the&#13;
        I&#13;
&#13;
                             transparency and fairness of trade practices amongst donors.&#13;
&#13;
                                         The second particular area is military spending.&#13;
&#13;
                             The sentence at the end of paragraph 25, to my mind, if&#13;
&#13;
                             anything, understates the effect the Cold War has had on the&#13;
&#13;
                             scale of military spending around the world.    Now that the&#13;
&#13;
                             Cold War is over, both industrialized and developing countries&#13;
&#13;
                             are looking for ways to reduce their military spending.&#13;
&#13;
                                         My own government announced last week a reduction&#13;
&#13;
                             of around 20 percent in its armed services over the next few&#13;
&#13;
                             years. This is, of course, an area where the desire of the&#13;
&#13;
                             exporting countries to sell military equipment may prevail&#13;

&#13;
                             issues, and in a declaration on arms transfers, issued&#13;
&#13;
                             earlier today, it called for restraint and transparency in&#13;
&#13;
                             arms' sales on behalf of the developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Perhaps I could go on to quote a section of the&#13;
&#13;
                             declaration, which goes on to say, "We believe that moderation&#13;
&#13;
                             in the level of military expenditure is a key aspect of sound&#13;
&#13;
                             economic policy and good government. While all countries -are&#13;

                             struggling with competing claims on scarce resources,&#13;
&#13;
                             excessive spending on arms of all kinds diverts resources&#13;
&#13;
                             from the overriding need to tackle economic development."&#13;

                                       We welcome the attention which the Managing&#13;

&#13;
                             of the World Bank have recently given to excessive military&#13;
&#13;
                             spending in the context of reducing unproductive public&#13;

&#13;
                             judgment on when a military establishment becomes unnecessaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             rily large is a delicate one.     It will often be outside the&#13;
&#13;
                             province of the Bank. But the Bank does have a comparative&#13;
&#13;
                             advantage in helping governments scrutinize and manage their&#13;
&#13;
                             public expenditure generally.&#13;

                             spending too as part of the Article IV process.    But-it is&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank which traditionally gets down to the greatest detail&#13;
&#13;
                             of public spending composition.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Both the Bank and Fund could usefully provide&#13;
&#13;
                             bilateral donors with an analysis of public spending to allow&#13;
&#13;
                             them to form their own strategies.&#13;
&#13;
                                       One final procedural pointr Mr. Chairman:     The Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             has an important role as the Chair of donors' meetings, aid&#13;
&#13;
                             consortiums and Consultative Groups.     I am sure that it is&#13;
&#13;
                             useful and should continue. But in its role as Chairman of&#13;
&#13;
                             these meetings, the Bank will and should continue to be&#13;
&#13;
                             responsible for transmitting the views of bilateral donors on&#13;
&#13;
                             government issues to developing country governments.&#13;

                                       It will also, while maintaining its apolitical&#13;

&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, this Chair welcomes the discussion on&#13;
&#13;
                             this important paper, which we think has taken into consideraÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tion the views of Executive Directors expressed in the&#13;
&#13;
                             seminar on April 11 on the paper prepared by the General&#13;
&#13;
                             Counsel on the question of governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We think the paper on the role of good government&#13;
&#13;
                             in development is a good one.   It is also balanced. The&#13;
&#13;
                             authors have succeeded in balancing different views on the&#13;
&#13;
                             issue at hand, and they have provided parameters within which&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank can practically and perhaps prudently address the&#13;
&#13;
                             issues concerned with good government, while avoiding those&#13;
&#13;
                             that are legally outside the Bank's mandate.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, we are tempted to praise the geograÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             phical balance of the paper, which would leave the reader in&#13;
&#13;
                             no doubt of problems of governance as defined in the General&#13;
&#13;
                             Counsel's memorandum, are not peculiar or specific to the&#13;

                             say, Mr. Chairman, that our views on the issue of good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance, which we have made at the seminar based on the&#13;
&#13;
                             paper by General Counsel remain the same.   Our comments today&#13;
&#13;
                             have in no way altered our position but merely supplement it.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Concerning the paper itself, I have a few comments.&#13;
&#13;
                             It is clear that strengthening and reorienting the capacity&#13;
&#13;
                             available in developing countries, especially in the audit&#13;
&#13;
                             and accounting function, could enhance accountability and&#13;
&#13;
-
                           hence the quality of governance in a country.   We would&#13;
&#13;
                             encourage the Bank to continue contributing to the strengÂ­&#13;

                             Reform.&#13;
&#13;
                                        However, the problem of staff attrition in the&#13;
&#13;
                             scarce skills of accounting and audit in many of our counÂ­&#13;

                             tries, which are likely caused by better remuneration outside&#13;
&#13;
                             the civil service, should be borne in mind in the context of&#13;
&#13;
                             its assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I am a little apprehensive as to what the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             should in the legal domain. A possible danger is that the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank's role in advising government's on legal aspects that&#13;
&#13;
                             could help improve economic management, including arbitration&#13;
&#13;
                             and preparation of binding contracts, might easily be&#13;
&#13;
                             confused with reform of the entire judicial system, which is&#13;
&#13;
                             a much more fundamental and sensitive issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I doubt that the Bank, as suggested by other&#13;
&#13;
                             speakers, has the competence either in terms of the required&#13;
&#13;
                             personnel or in terms of institutional experience to undertake&#13;
&#13;
                             such wide-ranging systemic reforms in the legal area.     Such&#13;
&#13;
                             reform exercises from what we know should be left, we think,&#13;
&#13;
                             to individual governments and to those bodies such as law&#13;
&#13;
                             reform or revision commissions that are better suited to do&#13;

                             legal framework for development.     I would like to note a few&#13;
&#13;
                             points, some of which we shared with the staff, which we find&#13;
&#13;
                             a bit intriguing.&#13;
&#13;
                                       First, paragraph 54 informs us that some future&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank operations will assist member countries in the training&#13;
&#13;
                             of judges in economics and business law.     This paragraph&#13;
&#13;
                             seems to give the impression that such training is new. As&#13;
&#13;
                             far as we are aware, legal training already contains programs&#13;
&#13;
                             in economics and business law and even development law.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Even laws, such as that cited in Box 11 in the case&#13;
&#13;
                             of Bangladesh, are not necessarily new for many countries.&#13;
&#13;
                             Nevertheless, we take the general point that legal systems&#13;
&#13;
                             should be strengthened to improve efficiency in economic&#13;
&#13;
                             management.&#13;
&#13;
                                       paragraph 44 on page 39 of Annex I is a bit&#13;
&#13;
                             misleading as to what the role of donors should be.     Perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                             staff could enlighten us a little.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The title of Box 8 of Annex I is also misleading,&#13;
&#13;
                             as it suggests a lack of legal order in Eastern Europe and&#13;
&#13;
                             Africa. We would suggest that, instead of the title "Legal&#13;
&#13;
                             Inconsistencies in Eastern Europe and Africa", perhaps the&#13;
&#13;
                             title could read "Legal Requirements for Economic Transition&#13;
&#13;

                                          We agree with the paper that the issue of government&#13;
&#13;
                             is a continuum, which does not necessarily improve over time&#13;
&#13;
                             but consideration of which must take into account the&#13;
&#13;
                             situation in each individual country. We agree with this.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In dealing with the issues relating to governance,&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank may do well to be guided by its own studies and&#13;
&#13;
                             discussions with specific countries but, more generally, as&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 59 on page 16 notes, quote, "Its past experience&#13;
&#13;
                             provides a counsel of caution", unquote.&#13;
&#13;
                                          It should proceed, as the lawyers say, ex cautela&#13;
&#13;
                             abundanta (Phonetic), with an abundance of caution.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In our intervention during the April 11 seminar, we&#13;
&#13;
                             were concerned the level at which issues concerning governance&#13;
&#13;
                             are to be discussed with our authorities. We are pleased that&#13;
&#13;
                             the paragraph 7 is not ambiguous on this matter, as it&#13;
&#13;
                             states, and I quote, "Technical issues are handled at staff&#13;

                               Therefore, we agree with paragraph 74 that such involvement&#13;
&#13;
                               by beneficiaries should be broadly based, and should include&#13;
&#13;
                               the use of local consultants, among others.&#13;

&#13;
                               I would like to invite management's attention to the OAU's&#13;
&#13;
                               African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and&#13;
&#13;
                               to one of the main recommendations of the South/South&#13;
&#13;
                               Commission report. The Commission was chaired by former&#13;
&#13;
                               President Jerusnereli (Phonetic).&#13;
&#13;
                                            The African Charter addresses participation issues&#13;
&#13;
                               at all levels, national and international, and defines the&#13;
&#13;
                               means of cooperation and assistance between the African&#13;
&#13;
                               countries and donors.     It provides a useful framework both&#13;

                               for local development and for dialogue and cooperation with&#13;

                               donors.   I recommend the document to concerned staff.&#13;

                                            While we agree that popular participation is&#13;
&#13;
                               desirable and necessary for effective development, we hold a&#13;
&#13;
                               slightly different view on the question as it is addressed in&#13;

                                            Community participation or action is one of the&#13;

                             construed to mean that participatory action is new in our&#13;
&#13;
                             societies.     Indeed, the introduction of colonialist type&#13;
&#13;
                             community development in many of our countries would not have&#13;
&#13;

                             adapted for wider use, and I refer here to social organizaÂ­&#13;

&#13;
                             of self-help.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In view of this, we would suggest that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             designs operations in such a way that use is made of these&#13;
&#13;
                             traditional organizations for social action and adapt or&#13;
&#13;
                             craft them to developmental action schemes in areas such as&#13;
&#13;
                             agro-forestry, primary health care and the provision of rural&#13;
&#13;
                             infrastructure. So, the idea really is not new.&#13;

                                          Although the idea of the Bank conducting the search&#13;
&#13;
                             in the area of governance should be encouraged, we think, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Chairman, that the research agenda as indicated in paragraphs&#13;
&#13;
                             75 and 76 of the main report could have been done perhaps a&#13;

                                          Our view on the matter is that most of the countries&#13;

                               sure, have inherited fairly strong judicial systems, whether&#13;
&#13;
                               based on English common law, Court Napoleon, or these&#13;
&#13;
                               existing in parallel with customary law, otherwise called&#13;
&#13;
                               native law and custom in the colonial administration.&#13;
&#13;
                                          These have coexisted with these systems for some&#13;
&#13;
                               time, some of which have been defined since independence,&#13;
&#13;
                               reform or sometimes sadly neglected.&#13;
&#13;
                                          To the extent that these laws are based on prinÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                               ciples that are universally accepted, they can be said to be&#13;
&#13;
                               culturally neutral.   Hence, it is unclear to me what could be&#13;
&#13;
                               involved in research on the rule of law or if research, so&#13;
&#13;
                               undertaken, would indeed break new ground.&#13;
&#13;
                                          My understanding of the rule of law is straightÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                               forward and is fully captured by then Mr. Quenton Hogg's&#13;
&#13;
                               (Phonetic) 1947 definition. He defined the rule of law as&#13;

                                law, he said, "AlII even the most powerful and wealthy, are&#13;

&#13;
                                           The third fundamental principle of the rule of law&#13;
&#13;
                                is that people should not take the law into their own hands.&#13;
&#13;
                                This rule is not absolute. All civilized codes ,admit in some&#13;
&#13;
                                degree the principle of self-help or self-defense, but,&#13;
&#13;
                                except in extreme emergencies, the rule of law excludes self-&#13;
&#13;
                                help.   Mr. Hogg wrote these words long before he became Lord&#13;
&#13;
                                Chancellor, and they are valid today as they were there.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Furthermore, research could, we think, be undertaken&#13;
&#13;
                                on those governance issues that are regional and/or internaÂ­&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       I am grateful to General Counsel for drawing my&#13;
&#13;
                             attention to this document.   At least one member in our&#13;
&#13;
                             constituency has addressed a memorandum to the Bank, the&#13;
&#13;
                             dialogue relating to international aspects of governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, in spite of some of the resolutions we&#13;
&#13;
                             have made, we do endorse management's proposal contained in&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 77 of the paper.    Let me again, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
                             commend the authors for a well-written, balanced and informaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tive paper which, if properly understood and disseminated,&#13;
&#13;
                             should take the heat out of the governance business and&#13;
&#13;
                             provide more light and better guidance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The major imbalance of the paper which, as I have&#13;
&#13;
                             said, I consider a very serious one is the impression&#13;
&#13;
                             conveyed that good governance is a peculiarly African&#13;
&#13;
                             problem. Mr. Chairman, this is incorrect, as current events&#13;
&#13;
                             elsewhere in Europe have shown.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Like the rule of law, the principles and practices&#13;
&#13;
                             are universal or ought to be so.   Mr. Landau's concluding&#13;
&#13;
                             remarks on the subject are quite appropriate and I trust&#13;
&#13;
                             management will be guided by a spirit of judicious restraint&#13;
&#13;
                             both in their policy dialogue and in their lending to&#13;

                                        MR. CONABLE:    Thank you, Mr. Langley, for a very&#13;
&#13;
                             comprehensive analysis.&#13;

                                        MR. BAIJAL:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                                        It is quite obvious that this paper has been very&#13;
&#13;
                             carefully prepared, and I am very thankful for that.     As many&#13;
&#13;
                             other speakers have said, it is balanced and well-written.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Aspects of good governance which directly influence&#13;
&#13;
                             economic performance have been dexterously segregated from&#13;
&#13;
                             facets which have a greater political coloring.      Emphasis has&#13;
&#13;
                             been placed on accountability, transparency and the legal&#13;
&#13;
                             systems.&#13;
&#13;
                                        There can be no doubt that improvements in these&#13;
&#13;
                             areas will strengthen instruments of development. But that is&#13;
&#13;
                             surely not the subject of debate. The question is to what&#13;
&#13;
                             extent these should be and can be induced by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                             Does the Bank have a comparative advantage in these areas?&#13;
&#13;
                             And if the answers to these questions is in the affirmative,&#13;
&#13;
                             the next question is:     How does the Bank go about in inducing&#13;
&#13;
                             these changes, whether through policy conditionalities or&#13;
&#13;
                             through providing of technical assistance on demand?&#13;
&#13;
                                        I, for one, am absolutely convinced that forcing&#13;
&#13;
                             these reforms through imposed policy conditionalities will be&#13;

&#13;
                             self-defeating, and should be avoided.     I entirely agree with&#13;
&#13;
                             Mr. Landau that the surest way to defeat our worthy objectives&#13;
&#13;
                             is to use order and constraint rather than persuasion.&#13;
&#13;
                                       A different set of questions has to be answered to&#13;
&#13;
                             fix the boundaries of these concerns. Each one of these areas&#13;
&#13;
                             can be defined so broadly as to subsume within it a political&#13;
&#13;
                             agenda, and then there will be a problem for the Bank to deal&#13;
&#13;
                             with them in keeping with its mandate.&#13;
&#13;
                                       On the other hand, even today through its various&#13;
&#13;
                             operations, the Bank is attempting to bring about improvements&#13;
&#13;
                             in these very same areas.    I am glad that the paper, in&#13;
&#13;
                             recognition of this, states that there is no need for&#13;
&#13;
                             defining additional criteria for governance.    Mr. Lateef also&#13;
&#13;
                             mentioned this in his opening statement.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The paper also rightly emphasizes that our objecÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tives can be served by effective and consistent application&#13;
&#13;
                             of criteria already adopted. And this is recognized in para.&#13;
&#13;
                             69 of the document.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It will be important for operational staff to&#13;
&#13;
                             imbibe this and concentrate on dealing with the more basic&#13;

                     challenge of development itself rather than get bogged down&#13;
&#13;
                             into the nuances of governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I   have another small worry, and that is that&#13;

&#13;
                             preoccupation with these issues can provide an excuse for&#13;
&#13;
                             failures in Bank-prescribed strategies, and enable Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             officials to avoid accountability for their suggestions which&#13;
&#13;
                             can lead to difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I would, therefore, suggest that accountability&#13;
&#13;
                             should be practiced within the Bank also.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I am a little concerned, although not too much,&#13;
&#13;
                             about the language in some sections relating to implications&#13;
&#13;
                             for Bank- practices. For example, in para. 62, while it is&#13;
&#13;
                             proper to speak of assisting governments in reforms that they&#13;
&#13;
                             have identified, the subsequent exhortation for persuading&#13;
&#13;
                             governments of the need for reforms and crafting country&#13;
&#13;
                             strategies to take into account governance issues seems to&#13;
&#13;
                             imply lending conditionalities linked to governance, which as&#13;
&#13;
                             I mentioned earlier should be avoided.&#13;
&#13;
                                        As has been emphasized by many speakers before me&#13;
&#13;
                             that the borrower's social and political evolution up to the&#13;
&#13;
                             stage at which we are today should always be an important&#13;
&#13;
                             factor.   We would need to be careful to ensure that Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             advice on such sensitive issues is demand-driven.&#13;

                                        The rule of law is certainly desirable, but it also&#13;
&#13;
                             implies a respect of the borrower's national laws and&#13;

                             effect on growth and poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
                                         In this context r governance can be expected to play&#13;
&#13;
                             an important role in development of management, helping in&#13;

                             can be expected to provide more transparency and accounÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tability.&#13;
&#13;
                                         As the amount of assistance to borrower countries&#13;
&#13;
                             substantially increased recentlYr the concern for misuse of&#13;
&#13;
                             resources also grew.    If we cannot mitigate this concern, it&#13;
&#13;
                             will become more and more difficult to persuade taxpayers in&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                         Thus, the idea of governance proposed in this paper&#13;
&#13;
                            is appreciated.     However, we would face some difficulties in&#13;
&#13;
                            implementing the idea in practice.&#13;
&#13;
                                         First, governance tends to touch upon very fundamenÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                            tal issues, such as legal frameworks, which should be decided&#13;
&#13;
                            upon by the borrower country itself.     Although SAL has a&#13;
&#13;
                            similar aspect, governance goes further into structures of&#13;
&#13;
                            borrower countries.     There is a limit in the Bank's role&#13;
&#13;
                            because it is up to the governments of the borrower countries&#13;
&#13;
                            whether or not they will take the actions expected by the&#13;
&#13;
                            Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                         While the Bank has to be cautious not to implement&#13;
&#13;
                            governance to such an extent that it intervenes in the&#13;
&#13;
                            sublimity of borrower countries, I think it is important that&#13;
&#13;
                            the key elements of governance indicated on pages 14 and 15&#13;
&#13;
                            and also in the annex should be taken into consideration at&#13;
&#13;
                            every stage of a dialogue between the Bank and borrower&#13;
&#13;
                            countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Second, the issue of the area in which governance&#13;
&#13;
                            is so fundamental to borrower countries that is it should&#13;
&#13;
                            affect the country's cultural and historical background.&#13;

                             Since each country has its own background, some of the&#13;
&#13;
                             governance issues should not be generalized, but should be&#13;
&#13;
                             considered on a country-by-country basis.&#13;
&#13;
                                         It is important to make efforts to divide issues&#13;
&#13;
                             which are to be generalized from 'issues which should not be&#13;
&#13;
                             generalized.     Otherwise, the outcome will be non-effective or&#13;
&#13;
                             even negative.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Third, there are some governance issues, which both&#13;
&#13;
                             donors and borrowers should collaborate on; in this connecÂ­&#13;

                             efforts and expect that a more concrete picture for the&#13;

&#13;
                                          Let me talk about each of these for a minute.&#13;
&#13;
                                          On decentralization, there is a lot of ongoing Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             work.     Actually, there has been a study done in the Africa&#13;
&#13;
                             Region. There is a fairly large study in the Latin American&#13;
&#13;
                             Region.     And we have tried not to duplicate in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
                             We think it is a very important area, but we have tried not&#13;
&#13;
                             to duplicate in this paper the work that is very largely&#13;
&#13;
                             demand-driven particularly in Latin America and Africa. There&#13;
&#13;
                             is a lot of work going on.&#13;
&#13;
                                          On popular participation, we regard this as very&#13;
&#13;
                             important.     As with the rule of law, from the perspective of&#13;
&#13;
                             governance, I mean, participation is not an end in itself but&#13;
&#13;
                             a means to poverty reduction, a means to enhanced environmenÂ­&#13;

                             embarked on a fairly large study, supported by Swedish SWEDA&#13;

                                         Let me go to Mr. Langley's point on paragraph 44 in&#13;
&#13;
                             Annex I.    I think all that is meant there -- and Mr. Shihata&#13;
&#13;
                             may want to elaborate if I didn't do justice to this -- all&#13;
&#13;
                             that we are saying there essentially is that one shouldn't&#13;
&#13;
                             expect too much from a legal system in the economic sphere,&#13;
&#13;
                             in the sense that in terms of emphasizing punishment for&#13;
&#13;
                             economic type of crimes, that the focus should really to look&#13;
&#13;
                             at the underlying cause and deal with it through another way,&#13;
&#13;
                             through incentive mechanisms, et cetera.      I mean, one&#13;
&#13;
                             shouldn't overload the legal system. That is what is meant,&#13;
&#13;
                             but it may not have come across all that clearly.&#13;

                                         I think the research program -- that was the other&#13;
&#13;
                              point that Mr. Langley raised -- the research program is not&#13;
&#13;
                              on further elucidation of the rule of law.      It is looking at&#13;
&#13;
                              the legal aspects of private sector, environment, security of&#13;
&#13;
                              contract, labor markets, public sector management issues, the&#13;
&#13;
                              legal status and contestability of administrative decisions.&#13;
&#13;
                                         All these have both country-specific and more&#13;
&#13;
                              generalized aspects and we want to see the connections,&#13;
&#13;
                              particularly with cultural issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                         I think, in general, on the research program, I&#13;
&#13;
                              agree we need to do a lot more thinking in that area, and we&#13;
&#13;
                              will keep you informed as that goes on.&#13;

                                         MR. LATEEF:    I think on the questions raised about&#13;
&#13;
                              the Bank policy and Bank role, let me address a few of them.&#13;
&#13;
                              I think on the Africa targeting, I think we have really -Â­&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. CONABLE:     There was quite a bit of sensitivity&#13;
&#13;
                              on that.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. LATEEF:    Right, sensitivity, and we have&#13;
&#13;
                              clearly miscommunicated that one. What we were really simply&#13;
&#13;
                              saying, I think, is that we need to have a fairly broad-based&#13;
&#13;
                              dialogue with all borrowers. The Africa Region is already&#13;

&#13;
                                        MR. CONABLE:    But you would agree that it is a&#13;
&#13;
                              general concern.&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. LATEEF:    Absolutely, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. CONABLE:    And the criteria should be general&#13;
&#13;
                              and that nothing further is intended.&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. LATEEF:    That is absolutely correct.   I think,&#13;
&#13;
                              as Mr. Langley himself noted, the participation by different&#13;
&#13;
                              regions of the Bank in our Task Force, and I think all of us&#13;
&#13;
                              from our very different experiences and perspectives did&#13;
&#13;
                              recognize that the problems identified in this paper, and the&#13;
&#13;
                              way in which we have defined governance, is fairly common&#13;
&#13;
                              across the board and not really confined to Africa or,&#13;
&#13;
                              indeed, to the South, as Mr. Langley noted.&#13;

                              asked? The Task Force will continue under a new Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
                              Mary Shirley, as the work is internalized in the Country&#13;

                              nation phase on this report is over, and then we will decide&#13;

                             the paper itself, I think the main emphasis I would like to&#13;
&#13;
                             give to that is that we would be encouraging staff to tap as&#13;
&#13;
                             much into other donors, as well as institutions like the&#13;
&#13;
                             Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, et cetera, where&#13;

                             there is a lot of expertise available. And that is the way we&#13;

                             a lot of the comments that were made on the paper which we&#13;

                             will take into account obviously.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                         MR. LATEEF:    That's right.&#13;

                                         MR. CONABLE:   Just as the report was quite careful&#13;
&#13;
                             and cautious, I think the comments have been also and&#13;
&#13;
                             thoughtful in the process.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. ISENMAN:   And well expressed like the one on&#13;
&#13;
                             crusaders. So, we have taken careful note.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Also, I would like to express appreciation for the&#13;
&#13;
                             praise that several Board members have had for this Bank-wide&#13;
&#13;
                             group effort at addressing this sensitive and important&#13;
&#13;
                             question.&#13;
&#13;
                                         As several of the speakers have noted, dealing with&#13;
&#13;
                             governance is not really something new for the Bank.     It is&#13;
&#13;
                             rather like the Moliere character who discovered that he had&#13;
&#13;
                             been speaking prose for a great many years without knowing&#13;
&#13;
                             it. But still, I think, from the comments that you agree that&#13;
&#13;
                             it is useful to focus specifically on this and look at&#13;
&#13;
                             examples, and look at the concepts involved.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Regarding the focus on Africa, just let me reiterate&#13;
&#13;
                             that this is a sensitive issue.     It was discussed in the Task&#13;
&#13;
                             Force, and the members of the Task Force from the other&#13;
&#13;
                             regions were quite surprised to find that anyone should think&#13;
&#13;
                             that this governance issue was something limited to anyone&#13;
&#13;
                             region or whether it is Part I or Part II. Clearly, there are&#13;

                               speakers have indicated, this is something that we do not&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
                               that basis that we thought it would be useful to have this&#13;

                                            On the issue of legal reform and possible Bank&#13;
&#13;
                               involvement in it, I think some clarification is in order.&#13;
&#13;
                               There is no doubt that a successful legal reform in any&#13;
&#13;
                               society cannot be imposed from the outside. As any student of&#13;
&#13;
                               law knows, legal evolution is based on the interaction of the&#13;
&#13;
                               real forces in the community and reflects the evolving&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                         If it is imposed from the outside, it will be self-&#13;
&#13;
                             defeating in the sense that soon enough, it will either be&#13;
&#13;
                             ignored in practice or will require frequent changes as to&#13;

&#13;
                                         So, by definition, a workable legal reform has to&#13;
&#13;
                             come from within.&#13;

                                         MR. SHIHATA:   Sure.&#13;
&#13;
                                         This does not, of course, minimize the importance&#13;
&#13;
                             of outside help, if needed by the country.&#13;
&#13;
                                         The outside help would be most effective in showing&#13;
&#13;
                             how other experiences have worked, especially in the modern&#13;
&#13;
                             sector, and it is this that is being envisaged, that to the&#13;
&#13;
                             extent that a country needs an assistance in a legal reform&#13;
&#13;
                             that originates within the country, in knowing better how&#13;
&#13;
                             similar issues have been regulated in more advanced economies,&#13;
&#13;
                             then this could be an area where support could be funded from&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                         This, of course, raises the issue Mr. Baijal&#13;
&#13;
                             mentioned. Should this be done through conditionality of&#13;
&#13;
                             adjustment loans?    I personally believe that this kind of&#13;
&#13;
                             reform should not be rushed and a country must have an&#13;

                             cing legal reform.    If only for this practical reason, in my&#13;
&#13;
                             own conviction, technical assistance loans would be a better&#13;
&#13;
                             instrument for introducing legal reform than rushing it&#13;
&#13;
                             through a quick-disbursing type of loan.&#13;
&#13;
                                         At any event, and as a practical matter, legal&#13;
&#13;
                             reform cannot take place without a request from the government&#13;
&#13;
                             involved.    No outsiders could go to a country and discuss how&#13;
&#13;
                             its commercial laws should be if the country is not willing&#13;
&#13;
                             to discuss this issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                         So, from a purely practical matter, this particular&#13;
&#13;
-'7.&#13;
   ,                         type of assistance takes place at the government request and,&#13;
&#13;
                             in fact, the Bank is receiving increasing requests in this&#13;
&#13;
                             area because of the transition that is happening in many&#13;
&#13;
                             countries towards the private sector.    People discover that&#13;
&#13;
                             there is no way private sector would develop in the absence&#13;
&#13;
                             of appropriate legal and judicial rules and mechanisms to&#13;
&#13;
                             allow it to function.&#13;
&#13;
                                         In other words, unlike in a command system, when&#13;
&#13;
                             things go by administrative orders in a market system, the&#13;
&#13;
                             legal framework is a necessity. And this is most obvious now&#13;
&#13;
                             in Eastern Europe but also in many countries, in the Middle&#13;
&#13;
                             East, in Africa. The Bank receives requests for assistance.&#13;

                                       Of course, we do not have the expertise here to&#13;
&#13;
                             provide training for judges, for instances, but what is&#13;
&#13;
                             envisaged is that, if in a certain country it is proven to be&#13;
&#13;
                             vital to have judges who are better trained in business law&#13;
&#13;
                             and commercial transactions, et cetera, then, as a component&#13;
&#13;
                             of a technical assistance loan, some funds could be provided&#13;
&#13;
                             to enable the country to have this kind of training. And that&#13;
&#13;
                             is what we are speaking about.&#13;
&#13;
                                       More recently, a number of institutions have been&#13;
&#13;
                             created, specializing in this type of assistance.   In fact, I&#13;
&#13;
                             personally contributed to establishing one, that is the Rome-&#13;
&#13;
                             based International Development Law Institute.   Most of its&#13;
&#13;
                             clients, in fact, today are African countries.   But its&#13;
&#13;
                             assistance covers a great number of countries and it is&#13;
&#13;
                             funded by many of the donor countries represented around this&#13;
&#13;
                             table also.&#13;
&#13;
                                       So, the need is there and, to the extent that it is&#13;
&#13;
                             relevant to the Bank's work, that is to economic efficiency,&#13;

                             solved otherwise; how, for instance, contract compliance can&#13;
&#13;
                             be ensured, how courts can perform their work within a&#13;

                                                MR. AL-ASSAF:     Mr. Chairman, I have reviewed the&#13;
&#13;
                                     paper before us with great interest.      I commend all those who&#13;
&#13;
                                     have been involved in its preparation for a thorough and&#13;

&#13;
                                     cannot be disputed.      At issue, however, is what aspects of&#13;

                             the second definition of governance in paragraph 1 of the&#13;

                             paper and the more detailed elaboration footnote 2 on page 22&#13;
&#13;
                             is the relevant one.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Indeed, as noted in paragraph 9, the General&#13;
&#13;
                             Counsel has already identified governance issues that lie&#13;
&#13;
                             within or beyond the Bank mandate, as laid down in the&#13;
&#13;
                             Articles of Agreement.   I believe this, together with the&#13;
&#13;
                             Board discussion of that paper at the April 11 seminar, has&#13;
&#13;
                             helped establish the framework for the paper before us and&#13;
&#13;
                             provide a good basis for today's discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                                       As the paper demonstrates, the Bank can do and has&#13;
&#13;
                             done much to promote accountability and predictability to&#13;
&#13;
                             improve the legal framework for development and to enhance&#13;
&#13;
                             the adequacy and reliability of information and the transÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             parency of the decision-making process.&#13;
&#13;
                                       These aspects of governance lie within the Bank's&#13;

                             mandate insofar as they have a bearing on economic developÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ment. In the process, the paper makes a number of important&#13;
&#13;
                             points, some of which I would like to repeat for emphasis.&#13;
&#13;
                                       First, concerning accountability and legal reform,&#13;
&#13;
                             it is extremely important to have careful preparation and&#13;
&#13;
                             thorough understanding of historical and cultural conditions&#13;
&#13;
                             in each country, as well as its political institutions and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              administrative capacity.     Here, Mr. Chairman, I welcome the&#13;
&#13;
                              point made just a while ago by Mr. Shihata, and I think they&#13;
&#13;
                              are very important, especially regarding the conditionality&#13;
&#13;
                              and also the need for technical assistance in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The second point, governance is a two-way street,&#13;
&#13;
                              as Mr. Peretz mentioned.     Donors' actions can promote good or&#13;
&#13;
                              bad governance. Donors have an important responsibility in&#13;
&#13;
                              this area, in resisting pressures from certain commercial&#13;
&#13;
                              interests.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Third, the Bank operates under a number of limitaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                              tions established by its Articles.     Indeed, this is a source&#13;
&#13;
                              of its widely-acknowledged professionalism and technical&#13;
&#13;
                              judgment.     It, therefore, should not take too much on itself&#13;
&#13;
                              in this area.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Fourth, when hiring consultants, the Bank needs to&#13;
&#13;
                              ensure that they are sensitive to the Bank's institutional&#13;
&#13;
                              concern and especially to member countries on circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Fifth, I share the Japanese Chair's view that the&#13;
&#13;
                              Bank should pursue a measured approach.     In particular, I&#13;
&#13;
                              endorse the view that the Bank should assist in the design of&#13;
&#13;
                              highly-differentiated responses and priorities, taking&#13;
&#13;
                              account of the country's institutional needs, its political&#13;
&#13;
                              economy, its society and history.&#13;

&#13;
                               to sound development management is crucial and could affect&#13;
&#13;
                               the Bank's onlending to the country.   However, as the paper&#13;
&#13;
                               and Mr. Iserunan just mentioned, judgment about development&#13;
&#13;
                               management and performance are already routinely made in the&#13;
&#13;
                               allocation of IDA resources and in assessing creditworthiness.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Therefore, additional criteria to reflect concerns&#13;
&#13;
                               with governance are unnecessary.   In this context, I share&#13;
&#13;
                               the view that technical assistance should be handled by&#13;
&#13;
                               staff, but sensitive issues should be handled by senior&#13;
&#13;
                               management.&#13;
&#13;
                                         I also share the paper's recommendation that the&#13;
&#13;
                               Bank certainly should not act as an agent for donor countries&#13;
&#13;
                               at Consultative Group meetings.&#13;
&#13;
                                         My seventh point, Mr. Chairman, concerning the&#13;
&#13;
                               recommendations or proposals outlined in paragraph 77, I can&#13;
&#13;
                               support management's proposals here.   Particularly important&#13;
&#13;
                               is the dissemination to the staff of the main messages for&#13;
&#13;
                               the Bank and what lies within its mandate and what doesn't,&#13;
&#13;
                               of course, taking into account today's discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Finally, Mr. Chairman, on military expenditure, I&#13;
&#13;
                               share the views of Mr. Benhocine in this regard.     I really&#13;
&#13;
                               believe that, although -- and I welcome that the Cold War is&#13;

                                              The issue of governance, as outlined in this paper,&#13;
&#13;
                                 in my view is crucial to the effectiveness of theÂ·development&#13;
&#13;
                                 activities of the Bank. The costs of poor governance and the&#13;
&#13;
                                 benefits of good governance are clear, not least as regards&#13;
&#13;
                                 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
                                              The main question, as several previous speakers&#13;
&#13;
                                 have identified, is what can the Bank do to assist member&#13;
&#13;
                                 countries to improve systems of governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                              It is clear, of course, that the Bank should not be&#13;
&#13;
                                 interfering in the design of political systems in borrowing&#13;
&#13;
                                 countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                              Mr. Shihata's earlier legal memorandum established&#13;
&#13;
                                 what I think is a sensible framework within which the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                 should work. And I think this paper that we are discussing&#13;
&#13;
                                 today is a very helpful further contribution.        I too would&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       The paper mentions that it is not possible to&#13;
&#13;
                             generalize about what systems of government tend to result in&#13;
&#13;
                             good or bad governance.    I think that may well be the case,&#13;
&#13;
                             so that a country-specific approach is probably required.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We certainly need to be aware of the danger of&#13;
&#13;
                             confusing political stability with good governance.     NevertheÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             less, as the paper itself states, it is easy to recognize&#13;
&#13;
                             good and bad governance.    I mention in passing that a reading&#13;
&#13;
                             of the recent review of government expenditure in Zaire&#13;
&#13;
                             provides an unhappy example.&#13;
&#13;
                                       And it is only reasonable that donors, including&#13;
&#13;
                             the World Bank, will be less likely to support countries in&#13;
&#13;
                             which development is hampered by poor governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       So, borrowing countries have a strong double&#13;
&#13;
                             interest in maintaining or improving systems which are&#13;
&#13;
                             conducive to good governance. Good governance is going to be&#13;
&#13;
                             fundamental to successful mobilization and use of domestic&#13;
&#13;
                             resources, and it will encourage the flow of external&#13;
&#13;
                             resources for development purposes.&#13;
&#13;
                                       There are obvious sensitivities involved in this&#13;
&#13;
                             area. Tensions can develop as donors for accountability&#13;
&#13;
                             reasons seek more efficient use of aid funds, while developing&#13;
&#13;
                             countries seek to retain discretion in the disbursement of&#13;

&#13;
                             key policy areas, in which the Bank can play an important&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                             roles to play in producing a successful outcome.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We support the paper's conclusions, and would like&#13;
&#13;
                             to see a more widespread attention given to governance in the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank's operations.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We agree that there is probably no need for&#13;
&#13;
                             additional criteria to reflect concerns with governance. But&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank's assistance efforts and monitoring of the governance&#13;
&#13;
                             issue need to be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I am rather concerned, Mr. Chairman, with the&#13;
&#13;
                             statement in paragraph 72 that the speed with which borrowers&#13;
&#13;
                             require resource transfers sometimes leaves insufficient time&#13;
&#13;
                             for adequate dialogue, and can cause the Bank to contribute&#13;
&#13;
                             to programs whose ownership is weak.&#13;
&#13;
                                       After a decade of experience in the provision and&#13;
&#13;
                             administration of adjustment loans, such a situation should&#13;
&#13;
                             no longer apply. Adjustment assistance should not be provided,&#13;
&#13;
                             of course, ahead of IMF involvement with the country concerned&#13;
&#13;
                             and not until very clear understandings have been established&#13;

                                 greater share of Bank resources to ensure the sustainability&#13;
&#13;
                                 of the reform process.&#13;
&#13;
                                           I support the statement in paragraph 64 that Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                 work in this general area of governance can only be embarked&#13;
&#13;
                                 upon in countries where there is a clear commitment to and&#13;
&#13;
                                 need for improved development management.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Another factor that we need to bear in mind is the&#13;
&#13;
                                 external economic environment in which countries operate,&#13;
&#13;
                                 especially in my view the trading environment, which can&#13;
&#13;
                                 hinder or assist significantly the task of government. The&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bank should use its influence, both direct and indirect, to&#13;
&#13;
                                 help to improve that environment.&#13;
&#13;
                                           But, as the paper notes, the Bank cannot substitute&#13;
&#13;
                                 for the political commitment and ownership that governments&#13;
&#13;
                                 must bring to reforms in this area.&#13;
&#13;
                                           I doubt that a great deal of further research on&#13;
&#13;
                                 the subject of governance is required, mainly because, as I&#13;
&#13;
                                 mentioned earlier, it is pretty easy to recognize good and&#13;
&#13;
                                ! bad governance. But I think the Bank should continue to&#13;
&#13;
                                 disseminate widely, not merely to staff, information on the&#13;
&#13;
                                 benefits of good governance and the costs of bad governance.&#13;

                                       The quality of governance comes out clearly in many&#13;
&#13;
                             OED studies, and I think too, as I think Mr. Peretz mentioned&#13;
&#13;
                             earlier, examination of patterns of public sector spending&#13;
&#13;
                             may be worthwhile in helping to get the message across.&#13;
&#13;
                                       To mention a few examples:   Are countries with&#13;
&#13;
                             current spending which is large relative to capital spending&#13;
&#13;
                             more likely to exhibit weak development management?     Are&#13;
&#13;
                             countries which make less use of domestic transfer payments,&#13;
&#13;
                             especially subsidies, likely to exhibit good development&#13;
&#13;
                             management?   Are countries which spend large amounts of&#13;
&#13;
                             public sector resources on the military likely to be prone to&#13;
&#13;
                             weak development management?&#13;
&#13;
                                       There are some other implications from the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             that emerge from last year's review of evaluation results.&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank staff, as many people have mentioned already this&#13;
&#13;
                             morning, need to be experts on the countries with which they&#13;
&#13;
                             deal, including in respect of their cultural and social&#13;
&#13;
                             characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Also, a country's absorptive capacity needs to be&#13;
&#13;
                             taken into account in decisions on lending volume. Lending&#13;
&#13;
                             which exceeds absorptive capacity may well exacerbate&#13;
&#13;
                             problems of governance.&#13;

&#13;
                             important.     It needs to be undertaken sensitively in order to&#13;

&#13;
                                          MR. COADY:     Mr. Chairman, we support strongly the&#13;
&#13;
                             thrust of the discussion paper and the important work that&#13;
&#13;
                             has been done by the Bank to ensure sound management of Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             resources.     Governance is a critical issue and, hopefully,&#13;
&#13;
                             can establish a basic element of development administration&#13;
&#13;
                             for the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
                                          As the discussion paper emphasizes, good governance&#13;
&#13;
                             is central to creating and sustaining an environment which&#13;
&#13;
                             fosters strong and equitable development and is an essential&#13;
&#13;
                             complement to sound economic policies.        In other words, good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance is of fundamental importance to the achievement of&#13;

                                       The paper shows the Bank already is approaching&#13;
&#13;
                             this issue in a very pragmatic manner, fully consistent with&#13;
&#13;
                             its legitimate mandate, using resources at hand to introduce&#13;

&#13;
                                       These efforts should be applauded, reinforced and&#13;
&#13;
                             expanded, where feasible, with our full support.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The discussion of the dimensions of governance&#13;
&#13;
                             makes some very useful distinctions in what are often a murky&#13;
&#13;
                             area. We are particularly interested in three areas:&#13;
&#13;
                             accountability, predictability in the legal framework, and&#13;
&#13;
                             transparency.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Accountability embraces both financial accountÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ability, which we all agree must remain a priority, and&#13;
&#13;
                             accountability for results. The Bank's paper discusses a&#13;
&#13;
                             willingness to monitor the overall economic performance of&#13;
&#13;
                             the government    this is in paragraph 9, page 9.      We would&#13;
&#13;
                             like to encourage the Bank to pursue vigorously this dimension&#13;
&#13;
                             of accountability, noting only that ultimately governments&#13;
&#13;
                             should not be held accountable just to the Bank and its&#13;
&#13;
                             staff, but more fundamentally to its own citizens.&#13;

&#13;
                               in broad-based economic growth and expanded opportunity, are&#13;
&#13;
                               not likely to be achieved if governments are not accountable&#13;
&#13;
                               to their own citizens and held   responsibl~   by their citizens&#13;

                               for their performance.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The Bank's emphasis on predictability in the legal&#13;
&#13;
                               framework for development, as well as its focus on information&#13;
&#13;
                               and transparency, are both central to this notion of accountÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                               ability.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The analysis provided on pages 10 to 13 make it&#13;
&#13;
                               clear that accountability is difficult, if not impossible,&#13;
&#13;
                               when there is no appropriate legal framework, no information&#13;
&#13;
                               and no transparency of government operations.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Consequently, here again, we urge Bank staff to&#13;
&#13;
                               pursue vigorously their efforts in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                          An additional area that bears discussion is the&#13;
&#13;
                               relationship between good management performance and lending&#13;
&#13;
                               levels. The paper suggests in paragraph 21 that lending&#13;
&#13;
                               levels have long been responsive to issues of development&#13;
&#13;
                               management performance.   It further suggests there is no need&#13;
&#13;
                               for additional criteria to reflect concerns with governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                          We would suggest that these statements do not&#13;
&#13;
                               reflect fully the current state of affairs.     All too often we&#13;

&#13;
                             will be necessary.   Governance clearly is an important aspect&#13;
&#13;
                             of project management, which has long-term implications. At&#13;
&#13;
                             the same time, by the Bank's admission, governance is&#13;
&#13;
                             evolving on the basis of acquired experience.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Lateef mentioned in his introductory remarks&#13;

                             that he has learned much very quickly, and much more is&#13;

&#13;
                             considered relevant to determining appropriate lending levels.&#13;

                                       The specific issue of military expenditures is&#13;
&#13;
                             particularly sensitive for all member countries.   NevertheÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             less, it is not an issue which can be ignored in the Bank's&#13;

                                          We should build immediately on both the work that&#13;
&#13;
                             has been done and the momentum that has been developed. The&#13;
&#13;
                             governance component should be a regular function of project&#13;

                             planning and implementation.&#13;

                                      The discussion paper provides insight into a number&#13;

                            of steps that might be taken in the immediate term to inject&#13;

                            current activities.&#13;

                                      For example, staff could require as a matter of&#13;

                            issue of governance, we do not believe that the African&#13;

&#13;
                            governance is a continuum and not necessarily uni-directional.&#13;

                             issue. Except for a couple of points, we do not have major&#13;
&#13;
                             problems with the paper per se.&#13;
&#13;
                                       However, the relevance of some aspects of .governance&#13;
&#13;
                             to the Bank's mandate raises an inherent challenge to avoid&#13;
&#13;
                             involvement in areas not permitted by the Articles of&#13;
&#13;
                             Agreement. The sensitivity of this issue and the risk of&#13;
&#13;
                             infringing upon the sovereign rights of the borrowers require&#13;
&#13;
                             that the Bank not only make a good judgment on the academic&#13;
&#13;
                             distinctions between the two kinds of aspects of governance&#13;
&#13;
                             in terms of relevance, but also adopt an appropriate approach&#13;
&#13;
                             to dealing with the governance dimension.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The operational manifestation of the governance&#13;
&#13;
                             dimension in the Bank's work has a direct bearing on its&#13;
&#13;
                             relationship with the borrowing members.    Unless handled&#13;
&#13;
                             properly, the Bank's involvement in this area will lead to a&#13;
&#13;
                             basic departure from the right course and adversely affect&#13;
&#13;
                             the execution of its mandate.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The nature of this institution would create a&#13;
&#13;
                             situation in which its involvement in this area is inherently&#13;
&#13;
                             biased against the countries falling into the category of&#13;
&#13;
                             borrowers. And given the proximity of the governance as&#13;
&#13;

                             the Board members representing the borrowers have a legitimate&#13;

                             concern about the risk that the Bank will make inroads into&#13;
&#13;
                             areas outside its mandate. And this concern is liable to be&#13;
&#13;
                             misinterpreted as an aversion to improving governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It will be very unfortunate if this will create a&#13;
&#13;
                             false impression that the Board is divided on this issue, and&#13;
&#13;
                             that some members presumed to have a clean record urge the&#13;
&#13;
                             other members to set their governance house in order, but the&#13;
&#13;
                             latter resist the admonition and even hate to talk about it.&#13;
&#13;
                                       IF there is such an impression, it must be disÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             pelled. Governance is important for all the countries,&#13;
"--, 
                       borrowers and non-borrowers alike.   However, it should be&#13;
&#13;
                             discussed in an appropriate forum.   It is essentially an&#13;
&#13;
                             internal affair to be dealt with by the sovereign governments&#13;
&#13;
                             themselves. And we want to make sure that the Bank will act&#13;
&#13;
                             within its proper bounds.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The same is true of democracy.     A false impression&#13;
&#13;
                             could also be created when someone objects that the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
                             not the right forum to discuss this issue.     It is as if some&#13;
&#13;
                             members are champions of democracy whereas others simply&#13;
&#13;
                             loathe the idea.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Democracy is also a matter of definition.     Besides,&#13;

                             who has the right to attach political labels?     Questions may&#13;

&#13;
                             is worthy of its name both in procedure and in substance.&#13;
&#13;
                                        This would lead to a series of further questions&#13;
&#13;
                             touching issues which fall way outside the mandate of the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank.   Paragraph 26 is problematic.   I want the Bank to be&#13;
&#13;
                             more careful in making judgment on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Finally, there are three points I want to emphasize.&#13;
&#13;
                                       -First, in dealing with the governance dimension,&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank should set specific, well-defined guidelines. The&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank staff should act within proper boundaries in their&#13;
&#13;
                             operational work under those guidelines, which should be&#13;
&#13;
                             strictly enforced and should not be stretched in application.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Second, wherever it is absolutely necessary to deal&#13;
&#13;
                             with the governance issues relevant to the Bank's operations,&#13;
&#13;
                             the dialogue with the government concerned should be conducted&#13;
&#13;
                             on an appropriately high level. The Bank staff should not go&#13;
&#13;
                             beyond the boundary of handling technical issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Third, on military spending, I hold that this item&#13;
&#13;
                             is more relevant to the U.N. forum, and does not have a&#13;
&#13;
                             proper place in the Bank's agenda. The Bank can neither claim&#13;
&#13;
                             competence in assessing the defense adequacy nor have the&#13;
&#13;
                             right to deal with military spending in accordance with its&#13;

                             thought out discussion paper.     As defined in this paper,&#13;
&#13;
                             governance is the manner in which power is exercised by a&#13;
&#13;
                             governing body in the management of its country's economic&#13;
&#13;
                             and social resources. And as such, I submit here that&#13;
&#13;
                             governance is an end product of the country's political and&#13;
&#13;
                             economic evolution over time or, at anyone time, a reflection&#13;
&#13;
                             of its history, culture and social norms and political&#13;
&#13;
                             orientation.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Differences in historical, cultural and social&#13;
&#13;
                             backgrounds, therefore, can prevent people of one country&#13;
&#13;
                             from appreciating or understanding the ways of doing things&#13;

&#13;
                                      The main contention here is perhaps whether the&#13;
&#13;
                            government has pursued a system of governance that addresses&#13;
&#13;
                            its people's specific needs and peculiarities. What the&#13;
&#13;
                            people want naturally has a lot to do with who they are.     We&#13;
&#13;
                            must respect their experiences and choices.&#13;
&#13;
                                      Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I, therefore, can&#13;
&#13;
                            be in general agreement with the main thrust of the paper.&#13;
&#13;
                            The Bank's legal mandate and its parameters, as had been&#13;
&#13;
                            identified in an earlier memorandum by the General Counsel,&#13;
&#13;
                            are very clear.   I would like to again give my endorsement&#13;
&#13;
                            and agree that governance can be relevant to the Bank's work&#13;
&#13;
                            and involvement only if it directly affects the manner in&#13;
&#13;
                            which a borrowing member country manages its resources for&#13;
&#13;
                            developmental purposes, especially in reference to the four&#13;
&#13;
                            key dimensions of governance, as discussed in Section III of&#13;
&#13;
                            this paper.&#13;
&#13;
                                      I welcome the affirmation being made in the paper&#13;
&#13;
                            that the legal restrictions from involvement in the political&#13;
&#13;
                            agenda serve to protect the Bank's reputation and integrity.&#13;
&#13;
                            I can also appreciate the observation that, because of the&#13;
&#13;
                            mixed and limited experiences of the Bank in this complex&#13;
&#13;
                            issue, it should move more cautiously, selectively and also&#13;

                                        Mr. Chairman, I don't believe anyone can disagree&#13;
&#13;
                              with the idea of managing development efficiently through&#13;
&#13;
                              good governance. This is what many developing countries have&#13;
&#13;
                              sought to do to the best of their ability under very adverse&#13;
&#13;
                              circumstances.&#13;
&#13;

                              cially of the kind that many developing countries have faced&#13;

                              good governance become difficult.     Indeed, crisis takes a&#13;

                                          Many of us can still recall the problem of goverÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             nance that many of the now highly-industrial countries faced&#13;
&#13;
                             during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Therefore, it would&#13;
&#13;
                             seem to be naive to presume that the major problems of&#13;
&#13;
                             economic development in the 1990s can only be resolved by&#13;
&#13;
                             imposing governance from above without, at the same time,&#13;
&#13;
                             addressing the fundamental disequilibria that characterize&#13;
&#13;
                             the external economic environment facing the developing&#13;
&#13;
                             countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Mr. Chairman, this suggests that you must maintain&#13;
&#13;
                             a sense of perspective in discussing problems of economic&#13;
&#13;
                             management and good governance. While good governance and&#13;
&#13;
                             economic management are important and desirable goals, the&#13;
&#13;
                             key question is what the Bank should or should not do in&#13;
&#13;
                             assisting countries to manage their resources and institutions&#13;
&#13;
                             efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In this connection, Mr. Shihata's excellent paper&#13;
&#13;
                             of June 20, 1991 provides a most appropriate framework for&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank's handling of management and governance issues.       It&#13;
&#13;
                             is absolutely important that the Bank should not exceed its&#13;
&#13;
                             legal mandate, as stated in its Articles of Agreement. These&#13;
&#13;
                             Articles clearly state that the Bank, and I quote, "shall&#13;
&#13;
                             scrupulously" -- and    I   repeat "scrupulously", which is a very&#13;

&#13;

                             strong word indeed, Mr. Chairman -- "avoid interference in&#13;
&#13;
                             the political affairs of any member", unquote.&#13;
&#13;
                                       However, despite this clear stipulation in the&#13;
&#13;
                             Articles, Mr. Shihata pad to note on page 47 of his paper&#13;
&#13;
                             that the coverage of governance, which has appeared in some&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank staff papers, has indeed exceeded the Bank's mandate.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We, therefore, need to be absolutely clear that in&#13;
&#13;
                             taking the Bank into new areas, transgressions of the kind&#13;
&#13;
                             that Mr. Shihata noted are totally avoided.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, the paper before us is useful and&#13;
&#13;
                             tells us what the Bank has been doing to promote efficient&#13;
 ;"'-"&#13;
                             management of development and institution-building.   It,&#13;
&#13;
                             therefore, can serve as a useful guide for future work.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We agree with the need for better economic and&#13;
&#13;
                             financial accountability, transparency and information, rule&#13;
&#13;
                             of law and efficient public sector management.&#13;
&#13;
                                       However, as we see it, the intent of the paper is&#13;
&#13;
                             not to set lofty benchmarks of an ideal platonic society, but&#13;
&#13;
                             simply to point out that there are important institutional&#13;
&#13;
                             initiatives that members of the Bank could launch to improve&#13;
&#13;
                             economic performance. In this respect, Bank management must&#13;
&#13;
                             be very careful so as not to trespass the boundaries defined&#13;

                                             The Bank can certainly assist through dialogue and&#13;
&#13;
                                persuasion without treading on the political sovereignty of&#13;
&#13;
                                borrowers.     It is important also that other development&#13;
&#13;
                                agencies and donors assume a similar principal stance as that&#13;
&#13;
                                expounded clearly in the Bank's Articles of Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Mr~   Chairman, I appreciate the sharp awareness&#13;
&#13;
                                brought out in the paper concerning the essential role of&#13;
&#13;
                                government in strengthening the legal, regulatory and&#13;
&#13;
                                institutional frameworks, which are indeed prerequisites to&#13;
&#13;
                                enhancing the capacity for sustainable development and&#13;
&#13;
                                improvement of social conditions.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Indeed, the recent trend in shifting policies to a&#13;
&#13;
                                more market-oriented direction does not at all mean that the&#13;
&#13;
                                role of the state should be discounted altogether.       It does&#13;
&#13;
                                mean a basic alteration of that role. Admittedly, this could&#13;
&#13;
                                appropriately entail a considerable down-sizing of governÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                                ment's operations, intervention and controls.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Mr. Chairman, I want to draw attention to paragraphs&#13;
&#13;
                                49 and 50 where the paper stresses that budgets must be&#13;
&#13;
                                transparent and the size of public expenditures should be&#13;
&#13;
                                commensurate with resource availability. We agree with this.&#13;
&#13;
                                However, the paper further continues by saying that military&#13;
&#13;
                                expenditures are often not subject to scrutiny and would&#13;

                             military spending, depending on the status of regional peace&#13;
&#13;
                             and security, the related defense and security requirements,&#13;
&#13;
                             and the armament balance existing in the region.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This is why, Mr. Chairman, we were surprised to&#13;
&#13;
                             read in the Development News the statement by the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             Chief Economist, highlighting that the World Bank was looking&#13;
&#13;
                             very seriously at whether it should lend money to states&#13;
&#13;
                             which spent more on arms than on other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Chairman, such statements are too simplistic&#13;
&#13;
                             and they lack the necessary qualifications and balance.     I am&#13;
&#13;
                             afraid that the recent law of Bank declarations that have&#13;
&#13;
                             been carried extensively in the international media might be&#13;
&#13;
                             interpreted as setting new criteria for eligibility for Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             assistance on the basis of size of military spending, even&#13;
&#13;
                             though no such policy has been discussed and agreed to in the&#13;
&#13;
                             Board.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I thought, Mr. Chairman, that important policy&#13;
&#13;
                             statements by Bank management should be an expression of the&#13;
&#13;
                             consensus of the Board.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Mr. Chairman, let me end by a few concluding&#13;
&#13;
                             remarks.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The first point I would like to make is that, since&#13;
&#13;
                             we are considering the paper in the Committee of the Whole,&#13;
&#13;
                             our remarks today do not imply an endorsement of its main&#13;
&#13;
                             conclusions and recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Secondly, the paper does not say anything about&#13;
&#13;
                             what steps and institutional arrangements are being envisaged&#13;
&#13;
                             within the Bank to ensure that further work on problems of&#13;
&#13;
                             managing development and governance are monitored carefully.&#13;
&#13;
                             Since the issue raised in the paper can be potentially&#13;
&#13;
                             controversial and sensitive, we would insist, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
                             that an appropriate monitoring system be established within&#13;
&#13;
                             the Bank for overseeing all economic and sector work and&#13;
&#13;
                             policy dialogue in the area, and that the Board be informed&#13;
&#13;
                             according.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Here, we emphasize that we would like to see the&#13;
&#13;
                             Legal Department playa central role in this process.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Thirdly, when this paper is disseminated among the&#13;
&#13;
                             staff, as proposed, the staff should be clearly informed that&#13;
&#13;
                             they should exercise a great deal of caution in interpreting&#13;
&#13;
                             its contents. We do not want the staff to get the impression&#13;
&#13;
                             that this paper gives them a license to enforce their&#13;

                                  particular views of governance on the borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                            This has been emphasized by both Mr. Benhocine and&#13;
&#13;
                                  Mr. Langley, based on, as I know, their own practical&#13;

&#13;
                                            Fourthly, we would like to insist that decisions&#13;
&#13;
                                  regarding governance and managing development should be left&#13;
&#13;
                                  entirely to the countries concerned and that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
                                  only provide assistance in this area when requested.&#13;
&#13;
                                            We would also like to strongly caution against the&#13;
&#13;
                                  use of political or quasi-political conditionality hidden as&#13;
&#13;
                                  economic conditionality in loan agreements.&#13;
&#13;
                                            Mr. Chairman, I have refrained from going into more&#13;
&#13;
'J&#13;
                                  detailed comments on the paper, but I feel that what is&#13;
!f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  important at this stage is to highlight the sensitivities of&#13;
&#13;
                                  the issues involved, and the need for the management to&#13;
&#13;
                                  ensure that we adhere strictly to the legal mandate of our&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                            I personally do not like the word "governance"&#13;
&#13;
                                  because it could have a rather broad and over-reaching&#13;
&#13;
                                  interpretation, as we indeed have already observed with&#13;
&#13;
                                  regard to certain declarations and statements which tend to&#13;

&#13;
                                          Mr. Chairman, I believe the focus should be on&#13;
&#13;
                             improving management of economic development and institution-&#13;
&#13;
                             building.     These are obviously areas where the Bank has a&#13;
&#13;
                             comparative advantage and can playa useful, supportive role.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Finally, Mr. Chairman, it is very important also&#13;
&#13;
                             that developed countries set the good example in the pursuit&#13;
&#13;
                             of sound macroeconomic policies and rationalization of&#13;
&#13;
                             government spending, including the military, as well as on&#13;

                             health, education and basic social services.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;

                             yourself very firmly.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Let's recess at this point.   When we come back, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Bonavoglia will be up, Mr. Le Bouder on deck and Mrs.&#13;

&#13;
                                          We have also, I think, quite a bit to do yet this&#13;

                             afternoon.     So, I think we better come back at 2:30, if that&#13;
&#13;
                             is acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
                                          There is another paper, as you know, and I think&#13;
&#13;
                             that will stimulate quite a bit of discussion as well.&#13;

                                       Mr. Mangiatordi is next.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                       As a financial institution, the Bank has a peculiar&#13;
&#13;
                             nature of dealing with only one category of customers,&#13;
&#13;
                             sovereign states.   For this very reason, some political&#13;
&#13;
                             impact is quite an inevitable consequence of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             activities, and it is not at all surprising--and quite&#13;
&#13;
                             commendable, in my view--that the staff tries to identify how&#13;
&#13;
                             to maximize in the context of the development program&#13;
&#13;
                             supported by the Bank what we could broadly define the&#13;
&#13;
                             political leverage of the institution, of course, within the&#13;
&#13;
                             framework established by the Articles of Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Reasoning a contrario, one could say that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             should be very cautious in providing financial assistance to&#13;
&#13;
                             countries that are experiencing bad governance.     This could&#13;
&#13;
                             be indeed, as far as the interpretation of the Articles is&#13;
&#13;
                             concerned, as disputable as imposing good governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The second element I wish to highlight is that in&#13;
&#13;
                             the last years, on the basis of a quite pragmatic interpretaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tion of the Articles, the Bank started the so-called quick-&#13;

                             disbursing lending.       By doing so, inevitably the Bank became&#13;
&#13;
                             more and more concerned about the ways in which the governÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ments of the borrowing countries used the money provided in&#13;

                             ditionalities should not be incorporated in adjustment&#13;

&#13;
                                           Thirdly, the Bank has to take care of its own&#13;
&#13;
                             creditworthiness.       The reliability of its customers has to be&#13;
&#13;
                             carefully scrutinized before proceeding with lending operaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tions.       How can this be done without taking into consideration&#13;
&#13;
                             the actual policy orientations of the member countries'&#13;
&#13;
                             governments and in some way their future stability?&#13;
&#13;
                                            Lastly, the Bank cannot simply ignore how its&#13;
&#13;
                             resources are viewed to alleviate poverty in the member&#13;
&#13;
                             countries, and to do so some political judgment has to be&#13;
&#13;
                             exercised on the concrete attitude of the governments in this&#13;
&#13;
                             priority area.&#13;
&#13;
                                            For all these reasons, I think that debate on&#13;
&#13;
                             governance, which covers an area that is by definition, as I&#13;
&#13;
                             have tried to explain, at the very core of the Bank's&#13;

&amp;#12;             ah                                                                           88&#13;

&#13;
                             with the last three recommendations indicated on page 21 of&#13;
&#13;
                             the paper, and I am ready to cooperate with the staff to&#13;
&#13;
                             develop such a discussion in the member countries of my&#13;
&#13;
                             constituency.&#13;
&#13;
                                        However, I feel it also unnecessary at this stage&#13;
&#13;
                             that the message contained in the paper be circulated to&#13;
&#13;
                             staff for specific guidance purposes.      As a matter of fact,&#13;
&#13;
                             the document should not be regarded as more than a synthesis&#13;
&#13;
                             of a much more complex analysis that needs to be developed&#13;
&#13;
                             further.&#13;
&#13;
                                        We should all agree to leave the door open for&#13;
&#13;
                             added discussion and contributions to a debate that is far&#13;
&#13;
                             from being concluded.     Let me conclude by saying that this is&#13;
&#13;
                             a difficult matter in which it appears desirable to proceed&#13;
&#13;
                             on the basis of a broad consensus.&#13;

                                        I too welcome the discussion of this paper by the&#13;

&amp;#12;            ah                                                                            89&#13;

                             on the General Counsel's legal memorandum defining the legal&#13;
&#13;
                             framework for the Bank's dealing with the issue of governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This paper was not easy to prepare because the&#13;
&#13;
                             subject--governance--is very   fashi~nable,   and everybody has&#13;
&#13;
                             his own understanding and definition of the aspects relevant&#13;
&#13;
                             to the Bank's work.   Governance deals with values which are&#13;
&#13;
                             universal and can usefully be applied to all countries,&#13;
&#13;
                             borrowing and nonborrowing members alike.      It has implications&#13;
&#13;
                             for borrowers as well as for donors.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I too would like to join others in commending the&#13;
&#13;
                             Task Force for a well-written and generally well-balanced&#13;
&#13;
                             report on the key dimensions of governance relevant to the&#13;
&#13;
                             work of the World Bank and their implications and limitations.&#13;
&#13;
                                       My main comment relates to the conclusion in&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 77(ii), which was already raised by Mr. Langley,&#13;
&#13;
                             Mr. Landau and others.   This part of the conclusion could and&#13;
&#13;
                             should be revised to dispel the impression that the governance&#13;
&#13;
                             issues are Africa-specific or that Africa is a pilot case for&#13;
&#13;
                             this broad-based dialogue which will be extended to other&#13;
&#13;
                             countries only when it has succeeded there.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The more so that this conclusion is not consistent&#13;
&#13;
                             with analysis particularly in paragraph 61, where we read&#13;
&#13;
                             that the LAC Region has developed a skill-mix to deal with&#13;

&amp;#12;              ah                                                                            90&#13;

&#13;
                             that issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                          My second comment has to do with the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             operational approach to promoting good governance.      The Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             should adopt a low profile in dealing with the issues of good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance in borrowing countries.      Too high a profile, or a&#13;
&#13;
                             ?   approach, are likely to backfire and compromise or&#13;
&#13;
                             jeopardize what the Bank is already doing, quietly but very&#13;
&#13;
                             efficiently, to promote good governance in borrowing member&#13;
&#13;
                             countries.     Let us all keep in mind that bad governance&#13;
&#13;
                             sometimes occurs also in countries with a plethora of foreign&#13;
&#13;
                             technical assistance, and that the population of many&#13;
&#13;
                             countries because of the colonial past and the past role of&#13;
&#13;
                             foreign technical assistance is very suspicious of foreigners&#13;
&#13;
                             when it comes to good governance particularly in its aspects&#13;
&#13;
                             of transparency and rule of the law.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The Bank should also adopt a low profile because&#13;
&#13;
                             good governance in many developing countries depends on the&#13;
&#13;
                             good governance behavior of their partners in the north, as&#13;
&#13;
                             explained in the report in paragraph 48.     The Bank's past&#13;
&#13;
                             experience and lessons and the skill-mix problem in paragraphs&#13;
&#13;
                             59 and 61 are additional arguments for a low profile approach.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.   I am trying to make my&#13;
&#13;
                             remarks short, but I have to go from one text to the other.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                       My third comment has to do with the way corruption&#13;
&#13;
                             was treated in the report.     The report rightly says in&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 48 that corruption is a two-way street.     I was&#13;
&#13;
                             expecting a symmetric dealing with the two ways, but was&#13;
&#13;
                             disappointed because the report is very elaborate in analyzing&#13;
&#13;
                             one way--corruption in developing countries--and very shy and&#13;
&#13;
                             circumspect in dealing with the second way--the corrupters&#13;
&#13;
                             from the north.     The report would have gained in transparency&#13;
&#13;
                             and credibility by having a less biased or a more symmetric&#13;
&#13;
                             treatment of the two actors on both sides of the two-way&#13;
&#13;
                             street.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The acceptance of the DAC recommendations in&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 48, their translation into an action program&#13;
&#13;
                             accepted by all parties for implementation, will be a good&#13;
&#13;
                             indication of how serious all the partners are in dealing&#13;
&#13;
                             with that issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                       My fourth comment has to do with the transparency&#13;
&#13;
                             and budget in developing countries discussed in paragraph 48&#13;
&#13;
                             and 50.   I personally am for a review of all public expendiÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tures including military expenditures.     However, I have to&#13;
&#13;
                             admit that certain approaches are not easy and also that it&#13;
&#13;
                             is not acceptable for several countries because of specific&#13;
&#13;
                             circumstances.     However, I believe that steps can be taken to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                             move toward the objective of transparency and reduction in&#13;
&#13;
                             military expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. David Peretz has given some encouraging news.&#13;
&#13;
                             I believe that the key steps are reliable, regional, and&#13;
&#13;
                             international security arrangements and agreements.    I am&#13;
&#13;
                             afraid these steps might be outside of the Bank's mandate and&#13;
&#13;
                             field of expertise.    They can nevertheless be pursued in&#13;
&#13;
                             other fora.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This leads me to my fifth and last comment, which&#13;
&#13;
                             is a suggestion.   The report would gain in acknowledging with&#13;
&#13;
                             more details the role of other actors, particularly bilateral&#13;
&#13;
                             donors, the United Nations institutions, and OECD in promoting&#13;
&#13;
                             good governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, let me congratulate again the authors of&#13;
&#13;
                             the report and repeat that I agree with the Task Force&#13;
&#13;
                             definition of the dimension of governance as it relates to&#13;
&#13;
                             the work of the World Bank.&#13;

&amp;#12;                      ah                                                                          93&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    discussed in April, and I basically with everything that has&#13;
&#13;
                                    been said in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 I still have five remarks and two question marks.&#13;
&#13;
                                    My first remark is on the role of the government. In paragraph&#13;
&#13;
                                    11 of the document, it states that the role of the government&#13;
&#13;
                                    is to provide rules, indeed to make markets work efficiently,&#13;
&#13;
                                    but then in some cases also corrective interventions are&#13;
&#13;
                                    mentioned.     I think that is too cautious.   I feel that the&#13;
&#13;
                                    role of government is just as much, at least as much as&#13;
&#13;
                                    corrective interventions.     So I don't understand this bias.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 In general the private sector tends to externalize&#13;
&#13;
                                    social and environmental costs to regulation to prevent that,&#13;
&#13;
                                    corrective measures to prevent that, are needed--not just in&#13;
&#13;
                                    some cases, but in my view everywhere.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 The same kind of bias I sense in both papers where&#13;
&#13;
                                    the lack of accountability that is being discussed is&#13;
&#13;
                                    basically only mentioned in the context of the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                    And only in the annex of the good governance is this broadeÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                                    ned and it is said that accountability has to be ensured also&#13;
&#13;
                                    in the private sector, and that governments do have a role to&#13;
&#13;
                                    take care of that through legislation and regulatory overÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                                    sight.&#13;

&#13;
                                                 My second remark is on enforcement of rules in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 40.    Indeed, existence of laws is not sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
                             Legal entitlements and rights must be accessible for all, and&#13;
&#13;
                             for this purpose also on this ground, empowerment of people&#13;
&#13;
                             through self organization should be promoted.    I hope that&#13;
&#13;
                             this study with eIDA on participation will also look at this&#13;
&#13;
                             from this angle.    Participation is crucial, and the BAnk&#13;
&#13;
                             should pay more attention to how the Bank can accommodate the&#13;
&#13;
                             emerging empowerment of people.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Then my third remark is on military expenditure.      I&#13;
&#13;
                             basically do agree with what Mr. Peretz said on that.&#13;
&#13;
                             Misallocation of official resources to unproductive activities&#13;
&#13;
                             is not just a symptom of poor governance; it is an element of&#13;
&#13;
                             poor governance.    The aim of development is poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
                             and the latest WDR rightly emphasized the need to spend more&#13;
&#13;
                             investment in human resources, and a central element of good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance should be the reallocation from unproductive&#13;
&#13;
                             expenditures to social services.    That is indeed within the&#13;
&#13;
                             mandate of the Bank in the context of public expenditure&#13;
&#13;
                             reviews, to ask for information on productive expenditure and&#13;
&#13;
                             to take this into account in its operations and in its policy&#13;
&#13;
                             dialogue.   And I would have appreciated seeing this point&#13;
&#13;
                             reflected in the chapter on "Implications for Bank Practice"Â­&#13;
&#13;
                             -although, of course, I agree with everybody who said here&#13;

&amp;#12;                   ah                                                                         95&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  that this issue should be addressed in a very cautious way,&#13;
&#13;
                                  and indeed, as long as there are no regional security systems&#13;
          '\&#13;
                                  in some parts of the world, then of course there should be an&#13;
&#13;
                                  understanding of the legitimate defense needs of country.&#13;
&#13;
                                  But still we cannot be silent about this.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Then fourth, I would like to use this occasion to&#13;
&#13;
                                  again repeat the plea I have made in the past to have also a&#13;
&#13;
                                  kind of long-term perspective exercise concerning other&#13;
&#13;
                                  regions.   I feel that that will also be helpful to prevent&#13;
&#13;
                                  the image that this whole issue of governance is something&#13;
&#13;
                                  that is only relevant to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
                                             My fifth and last remark is that I am glad to note&#13;
&#13;
                                  that the issue of participation, at least on micro level, is&#13;
&#13;
                                  recognized as relevant within the mandate of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                  However, I feel that that is too restricted only on micro&#13;
&#13;
                                  level, and this brings me to my first question mark.&#13;
&#13;
                                             In the annex in box 5, "participation" is defined&#13;
&#13;
                                  in a broader sense as influence on development decisions, not&#13;
&#13;
                                  simply involvement in the implementation or benefits of&#13;
&#13;
                                  development activity"--and indeed, the Bank experience does&#13;
&#13;
                                  indicate that public consultation and information sharing can&#13;
&#13;
                                  improve the design and the building of public support for&#13;
&#13;
                                  policy decisions in the context of adjustment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       And if we talk about "ownership" I often wonder who&#13;
&#13;
                             do we want to be the owner--the minister of finance in the&#13;
     '.&#13;
&#13;
                             country, or a society at large--and how can ownership take&#13;
&#13;
                             root without any legitimacy in a democratic sense.     I really&#13;
&#13;
                             congratulate staff that they were able not to use the word&#13;
&#13;
                             "democracy", but I find it very difficult in part of the&#13;
&#13;
                             discussion here, so let me be frank, and I hope Mr. Wang will&#13;
&#13;
                             forgive me.   Let me make sure--I do want to emphasize that if&#13;
&#13;
                             I mention the word "democratic structures" that I don't mean&#13;
&#13;
                             the Western-style democracies.   Democracy can take many&#13;
&#13;
                             different forms in different societies, and I don't want to&#13;
&#13;
                             advocate a typical Western kind only because they among&#13;
&#13;
                             themselves differ very greatly, and Western parliamentarians&#13;
&#13;
                             have never been able to agree among themselves what the&#13;
&#13;
                             essence of that system indeed should be or would be.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Furthermore, I also agree that the existence of&#13;
&#13;
                             democratic structures in itself are not sufficient to prevent&#13;
&#13;
                             government from yielding to the interests of narrow conÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             stituencies and sometimes constituencies of less than one&#13;
&#13;
                             percent of the electorate.   The result of this is, for&#13;
&#13;
                             instance, the common agricultural policy of the EEe or the&#13;
&#13;
                             Multi-Fiber Agreement.   So democracy really is not an answer&#13;
&#13;
                             to a lot of problems.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       But nevertheless I do feel that accountability&#13;
&#13;
                             loses parts of its meaning if there is no democratic body to&#13;
,'-Â­&#13;
                             be accountable to.     I just don't understand what accounÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tability would be without that.     Also, lack of democratic&#13;
&#13;
                             structures can also have adverse effects on the legitimacy&#13;
&#13;
                             and credibility of the rule of law.&#13;
&#13;
                                          I'm not sure if I want answers from staff about&#13;
&#13;
                             those questions, but I found it intellectually very hard,&#13;
&#13;
                             although I congratulate for this paperl not using the word&#13;
&#13;
                             "democracy" at all.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Then I have a second question mark.   Like Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Langley and others, I feel that the paper leaves me too much&#13;
&#13;
                             with a feeling as if poor government is a problem of developÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ing countries.     Once mention is made of the fact that&#13;
&#13;
                             corruption occurs in all countries.     Indeed, also in my&#13;
&#13;
                             country we     have our unproductive expenditures! we have our&#13;
&#13;
                             white elephants l we have our cases of political patronage, we&#13;
&#13;
                             have our rent-seeking vested interest groups that terrorize&#13;
&#13;
                             our political system.     I mean, we are not that much better,&#13;
&#13;
                             so I wonder who is allowed to throw the first stone here.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In that context, I am really not sure to what&#13;
&#13;
                             extent the Bank has comparative advantage in this discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                             It may be UN agencies or regional banks could be better-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             equipped.    To be perfectly honest, I've got some problems&#13;
&#13;
                             with the fact that most staff of the Bank have mainly been&#13;
&#13;
                             working within this very protected environment here, and few&#13;
&#13;
                             have ever been exposed to responsibilities of governance and&#13;
&#13;
                             to the hardships that go with accountability.      And one can&#13;
&#13;
                             wonder if staff has the necessary humility, sensitivity, and&#13;
&#13;
                             caution to handle issues like this.&#13;
&#13;
                                          I was struck by the fact that basically the&#13;
&#13;
                             Executive Summary does mention the need to sensitize staff&#13;
&#13;
                             for this purpose, but the paper itself hardly elaborates this.&#13;
&#13;
                                          My second problem is about the comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
                             of the Bank.     There is the skill-mix problem.   Mr. Thalwitz&#13;
&#13;
                             raised that himself when he addressed the OAC high-level&#13;
&#13;
                             meeting last year on governance, and also the paper refers to&#13;
&#13;
                             this need.     But I would like to hear when we are going to do&#13;
&#13;
                             something about this problem with skill-mix.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Last but not least--and this is only mentioned in&#13;
&#13;
                             the paper on public sector management, but I feel it is as&#13;
&#13;
                             important--the frequent turnover of Bank staff working on a&#13;
&#13;
                             particular country really creates a problem in dealing with&#13;
&#13;
                             those issues.     By the time they get local, by the time they&#13;
&#13;
                             go local, by the time they start to under the social/cultural&#13;
&#13;
                             situation of a country, they are moved to another place in&#13;

&#13;
                             address the kind of long-term issues that we say we want in&#13;
&#13;
                             this paper.&#13;
&#13;
                                          I am, by the way, glad to note that that paper&#13;
&#13;
                             refers to the need to make more use of field offices, field&#13;
&#13;
                             staff for these kinds of discussions.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In short, Mr. Chairman, let me finalize by saying&#13;
&#13;
                             that I agree with the conclusions and the recommendations, and&#13;
&#13;
                             I actually hope that this Task Force will not be dissolved,&#13;
&#13;
                             but will continue to exist to keep the issue on the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:    Thank you very much.&#13;

&#13;
                                          I support the discussion paper.     It is very well-&#13;
&#13;
                             balanced, and the important issues are properly addressed.&#13;
&#13;
                             It is a good basis for our work on this issue.        I will&#13;
&#13;
                             restrict myself to a few remarks on three pOints.&#13;
&#13;
                                          First, on participation.     Participation is a key&#13;
&#13;
                             element of good governance and necessary to stabilize&#13;
&#13;
                             economic systems.        Decisionmakers simply have to know what&#13;
&#13;
                             those people think who are affected by their projects and&#13;
&#13;
                             programs.     Without this feedback, they cannot avoid getting&#13;

&amp;#12;           ah                                                                               100&#13;

&#13;
                              out of touch with reality and doing things that are not in&#13;
&#13;
                              the interests of the target groups they want to reach.     My&#13;
&#13;
                              authorities put great emphasis on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Participation is dealt with in the paper as a sub-&#13;
&#13;
                              point under accountability.     I would have wished participation&#13;
&#13;
                              to playa more prominent role in the discussion paper.&#13;
&#13;
                                          My second remark is on the question of selective&#13;
&#13;
                              versus comprehensive approach.     I agree that a selective&#13;
&#13;
                              approach is needed on governance for resource reasons and&#13;
&#13;
                              because some governments might not be ready to tackle certain&#13;
&#13;
                              issues.     But I want to encourage staff not to be too defensive&#13;
&#13;
                              on these matters and to come forward with convincing arguments&#13;
&#13;
                              when and where they are being asked for.&#13;
&#13;
                                          As good governance is a precondition for sustainable&#13;
&#13;
                              economic development, it is of importance across the board.&#13;
&#13;
                              It clearly is an issue that should be part of the policy&#13;
&#13;
                              dialogue.     It is also, as we are all aware, a delicate issue&#13;
&#13;
                              that needs good judgment.     But if the Bank lags behind on&#13;
&#13;
                              governance, this could in the long term have consequences on&#13;
&#13;
                              the Bank's ability to design programs, coordinate aid, and&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                             "learning by doing".     Many elements of good governance have&#13;
&#13;
                             already found their way into our daily work.     Good governance&#13;
&#13;
                             is nothing fundamentally new.     But we also, by no means, have&#13;
&#13;
                             reached the end of the road.     Our understanding of good&#13;
&#13;
                             governance will evolve in the future, and we will learn in&#13;
&#13;
                             this process.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I would like to plead to keep an open mind on that.&#13;
&#13;
                             For example, I am not sure that, as is stated on page 19,&#13;
&#13;
                             additional criteria to reflect concerns with governance are&#13;
&#13;
                             not needed.     I know of the difficulties to develop such&#13;
&#13;
                             criteria, and I cannot offer such criteria offhand, but I&#13;
&#13;
                             could very well imagine that work and research on these&#13;
&#13;
                             issues might offer new insights.&#13;

                                       Let me close by commending staff on this very good&#13;

                                       This discussion paper on managing development is an&#13;

                             excellent operational follow-up of Mr. Shihata's memorandum&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            we can clarify in parallel the legal limitations and the&#13;
&#13;
                            practical potentialities for Bank activities as regards&#13;
&#13;
                            governance.   These useful clarifications don't mean that we&#13;
&#13;
                            now have a code of conduct for governance issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                      We still need a permanent training from past and&#13;
&#13;
                            future experiences.   We still have to be aware of the high&#13;
&#13;
                            sensitivity of this field of action, and we still have to&#13;
&#13;
                            rely on a realistic, case-by-case approach.&#13;
&#13;
                                      Along with these considerations, we also have&#13;
&#13;
                            another basic guidance, which is illustrated by the suggesÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                            tions of the report on managing development.   The Bank is an&#13;
&#13;
                            international organization in charge of cooperation for&#13;
&#13;
                            development, more than a financial institution.     To fulfill&#13;
&#13;
                            this mandate, the Bank's operations suggested in the report&#13;
&#13;
                            have to rely on criteria of good governance applied to the&#13;
&#13;
                            internal and external behavior of our institution.&#13;
&#13;
                                      As regards the internal good governance of the&#13;
&#13;
                            Bank, we can rely on Mr. Shihata's statement at the seminar&#13;
&#13;
                            held on April 11th:   tiThe Bank may take economic consideraÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                            tions into account even if they have political origins or are&#13;
&#13;
                            associated with political factors, as long as the economic&#13;
&#13;
                            effects are clearly established."&#13;
&#13;
                                      But the Bank's important position in the interna-&#13;

                             tiona I economic system also implies a good external behavior.&#13;
&#13;
                             The Bank can play a role to improve and monitor international&#13;
&#13;
                             governance.   As we have often stated in the Development&#13;
&#13;
                             Committee meetings and in many other fora, developing&#13;
&#13;
                             countries need predictability of their global economic&#13;
&#13;
                             environment to sustain their domestic governance and their&#13;
&#13;
                             economic management.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Many Directors expressed here their concern for the&#13;
&#13;
                             political conditionality which can appear in the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             operations.   This danger exists for the operations mentioned&#13;
&#13;
                             in the discussion paper on managing development, particularly&#13;
&#13;
                             with assessments such as the one in paragraphs 67 and 69,&#13;
&#13;
                             where there is a link between the failure of the dialogue on&#13;
&#13;
                             governance with the borrower and the reduction of lending.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It should be very clear that if a borrower does not&#13;
&#13;
                             accept the Bank's cooperation on some issues which he&#13;
&#13;
                             considers as inappropriate for the Bank's intervention, this&#13;
&#13;
                             decision by itself should never be a justification to reduce&#13;
&#13;
                             lending in other areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                       There could only be a reasonable link with the&#13;
&#13;
                             volume of lending and assistance when the economic management&#13;

&amp;#12;             ah                                                                         104&#13;

&#13;
                                       Anyway, we must be aware that this general axiom is&#13;
&#13;
                             more theoretical than practical.     It is easier to say that&#13;
&#13;
                             the borderline will be objective and defined with technical&#13;
&#13;
                             criteria than to do so in practice.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Therefore, the management has an important discreÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tionary margin of action between political and economic&#13;
&#13;
                             conditionality, which it should consider with caution and&#13;
&#13;
                             realism or, once again, with its own good governance criteria&#13;
&#13;
                             and with continuous good judgment.    Such a good judgment for&#13;
&#13;
                             each case is particularly needed because we have not developed&#13;
&#13;
                             specific benchmarks to assess issues such as the accounÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tability or public sector management as we have benchmarks to&#13;
&#13;
                             evaluate the adjustment operations, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Precisely, the developing countries where there are&#13;
&#13;
                             deep problems of public sector management, accountability,&#13;
&#13;
                             legal framework and so on, are the most needed in terms of&#13;
&#13;
                             economic and technical assistance.    Because the Bank is a&#13;
&#13;
                             development instrument, we should be very careful when we use&#13;
&#13;
                             the assessment of the governance of a specific country as a&#13;
&#13;
                             parameter to determine the volume of the Bank's lending.&#13;
&#13;
                                       This Chair agrees with the technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
                             which the Bank can give in the activities mentioned in the&#13;
&#13;
                             paper on managing development.     The Bank can playa useful&#13;

                             role in improving public sector effectiveness in its social&#13;
&#13;
                             and economic responsibilities, particularly as regards the&#13;
&#13;
                             judicial system, which we consider as a priority because it&#13;
&#13;
                             is a basic element for private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
                                          In this sense, we found extremely useful the&#13;
&#13;
                             example mentioned in Box 11 in Annex I of the paper, regarding&#13;
&#13;
                             the commercial codes in Bangladesh.     We also share Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Shihata's views on the importance of training for judges as a&#13;
&#13;
                             good example of technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                                          But the Bank's involvement r as it is stated in the&#13;
&#13;
                             paper, should never go beyond its effective capabilities&#13;
&#13;
                             compared with other international or regional organizations.&#13;
&#13;
                             Therefore we welcome the reference to the coordination with&#13;
&#13;
                             other institutions, and we would like to have a review of&#13;
&#13;
                             many examples of fruitful coordination in our next discussion&#13;
&#13;
                             on management and development.&#13;
&#13;
                                          We also agree with the proposals for the next Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             actions mentioned in paragraph 77, but we can add some&#13;
&#13;
                             methodological suggestions aimed at deepening the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             experience and prudence in the governance dimension.&#13;

&#13;
                             individual country's particularities and needs.     Third, in&#13;
&#13;
                             the research program, we would like to include some analysis&#13;
&#13;
                             on the external environment which affects a country's&#13;
&#13;
                             economic management and ideas on how the Bank can help to&#13;
&#13;
                             reduce the negative effects of those policies of developed&#13;
&#13;
                             countries which are example of bad international governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Finally, we support the idea to have a progress&#13;
&#13;
                             report on the Bank's experience in two years, and we already&#13;
&#13;
                             appreciate the successful cases mentioned in the management&#13;
&#13;
                             development paper.   In the progress report, we would also&#13;
&#13;
                             like to have some information on the Bank's experience in its&#13;
&#13;
                             application of the good judgment which we already mentioned&#13;
&#13;
                             and on the cases where the Bank's assistance fails or did not&#13;
&#13;
                             fulfill its original goals.   In the field of governance, bad&#13;
&#13;
                             experiences are useful even more than good experiences.&#13;

&#13;
                             technical nature, the issues focused on in this report are&#13;
&#13;
                             complex and very sensitive in political terms.&#13;
&#13;
                                         On the elimination of monopolies, for example, one&#13;
&#13;
                             could easily reach an agreement in technical terms.       But&#13;
&#13;
                             since the monopoly was established by political forces, the&#13;
&#13;
                             political implications of such a change should be assessed.&#13;
&#13;
                                         The complexity of those issues is very well-&#13;
&#13;
                             recognized in this report, and I am happy with management's&#13;
&#13;
                             recommendations in attributing to senior managers responÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             sibility for the handling of sensitive issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Moreover, the report also recommends a more&#13;
&#13;
                             conscious effort to understand the political and social&#13;
&#13;
                             structure and the customs and laws of its borrowers, the need&#13;
&#13;
                             to foster an implementation future within the Bank, and to&#13;
&#13;
                             sensitize staff to the need to handle issues in this area with&#13;
&#13;
                             humility, sensitivity and caution.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nevertheless I have several comments on some major&#13;
&#13;
                             concerns.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Most of the developing countries are in a process&#13;
&#13;
                             of democratization.    Sovereignty and constitutional responÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             sibilities of the governments in legislative, judicial and&#13;
&#13;
                             executive branches are very sensitive issues.    In this sense,&#13;

&#13;
                             very cautious manner, I suggest that in this report we may&#13;
&#13;
                             avoid expressions such as "intervention" or "persuasion".&#13;
&#13;
                             That the Bank already knows everything included in social,&#13;
&#13;
                             cultural and political constraints not true.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Humility is not a quality easily found among Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             staff--even among those in high-level positions.     This&#13;
&#13;
                             feeling will be very important in the dialogue with the&#13;
&#13;
                             countries since, when the dialogue fails, the Bank's own&#13;
&#13;
                             lending to the countries is likely to be affected.&#13;
&#13;
                                       On reflections on corruption, we have to agree that&#13;
&#13;
                             the recommendations for developing countries are also true&#13;
&#13;
                             for donor countries.    Corruption is a two-way street, and&#13;
&#13;
                             donors have the responsibility to ensure that commercial&#13;
&#13;
                             considerations do not undermine good economic management in&#13;
&#13;
                             developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                       On research, the program could be done with a more&#13;
&#13;
                             practical and pragmatic approach by the extensive use of&#13;
&#13;
                             information existing in the Bank as well as backing up the&#13;
&#13;
                             operational findings and lessons learned throughout the&#13;
&#13;
                             experience with theoretical explanations.    The dissemination&#13;
&#13;
                             of these findings could also be improved in order to facilitÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ate the dialogue between the Bank and the developing counÂ­&#13;

                                            I will try to be brief.      But I do want to join&#13;

                                from its concerns about good development, but as so many&#13;
&#13;
                                others have said, although legitimate, it should be approached&#13;
&#13;
                                with caution and modesty.&#13;
&#13;
                                            I'd like to suggest a couple of areas in which I&#13;
&#13;
                                might have hoped that there might have been a little more&#13;
&#13;
 -,~&#13;
                                emphasis.    The first is that the relatively active role of the&#13;
&#13;
                                Bank in the area of governance should indeed be encouraged&#13;
&#13;
                                and deepened.    In many countries the need to strengthen&#13;

&amp;#12;            ah                                                                          110

                             development management is clear, and in its absence the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank's record of program and project implementation is almost&#13;
&#13;
                             certain to deteriorate.   A stronger focus on governance&#13;
&#13;
                             issues also appears to be essential if the Bank is serious&#13;
&#13;
                             about its desire to create an implementation culture within&#13;
&#13;
                             the institution.&#13;
&#13;
                                        As to the need for selectivity, this is hardly new.&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank resources have always been limited, and in this context,&#13;
&#13;
                             greater selectivity amounts to little more than using those&#13;
&#13;
                             resources where they have the best chance of being effective.&#13;
&#13;
                             This governance debate highlights the fact that a strong&#13;
&#13;
                             political commitment to reform is essential for effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                             Programs and projects which come to the Board should recognize&#13;
&#13;
                             this dimension explicitly.&#13;
&#13;
                                        If I could mention a few areas either of omission&#13;
&#13;
                             or in need of better articulation, and I hope you will bear&#13;
&#13;
                             with me.   First, the implications for the Bank of growing&#13;
&#13;
                             donor concern about governance in my opinion needs to be&#13;
&#13;
                             better articulated.   The paper simply indicates that donor&#13;
&#13;
                             concerns are surfacing increasingly in consultative group&#13;
&#13;
                             meetings and other fora, but the Bank is not unaffected by&#13;
&#13;
                             such developments.&#13;
&#13;
                                        The erosion of donor support has implications for&#13;

                             the viability of a country's financing plan, and that in turn&#13;
&#13;
                             has an important bearing on the quality of our own commitÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ments and hence, our own credit-bearing capacity.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Second, the discussion of popular participation,&#13;
&#13;
                             although discussed more this morning with references to&#13;
&#13;
                             Swedish eIDA and so on, seems to me in the paper to need more&#13;
&#13;
                             attention.     Although popular participation is both time and&#13;
&#13;
                             resource-intensive, Bank studies have shown that it almost&#13;
&#13;
                             invariably improves the changes of project sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
                             In fact, as the box on page 33 notes, virtually every&#13;
&#13;
                             participatory project financed by the Bank has contributed to&#13;
&#13;
                             project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Nevertheless our participatory projects still tend&#13;
&#13;
                             to be the exception rather than the rule.     It would seem to&#13;
&#13;
                             me that there is room for us to strive for better balance.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Third, our relative comparative advantage in the&#13;
&#13;
                             area of governance to other multilateral institutions or&#13;
&#13;
                             bilateral donors needs to be explored.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Fourth, the Bank should coordinate its human&#13;
&#13;
                             resource development strategy with an expanding role in&#13;
&#13;
  ,,~&#13;
                             governance issues.     The Bank's current capacity to deal&#13;
&#13;
                             effectively with governance issues is constrained by its&#13;
&#13;
                             skill mix.     This has led to heavy reliance on external&#13;

                                             And fifth, the issue of military expenditure is&#13;
&#13;
                                  mentioned only in passing.    The paper justifies the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                                  interest in military spending in terms of its crowding out on&#13;
&#13;
                                  development expending, but it needs to redefine its thinking&#13;
&#13;
                                  in this area.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Finally, a couple of comments on the paper's&#13;
&#13;
                                  conclusions.    The proposal for a progress report in two years&#13;
&#13;
                                  seems to me, as it did to Mr. Haralz, a little rigid.     I&#13;
&#13;
                                  rather liked the way Mr. Mangiatordi ended his comments after&#13;
&#13;
                                  lunch, the gist of which if I understood them correctly is&#13;
     "~Â·:t\.&#13;
          1~&#13;
                                  that this issue will move along quickly, and there well may&#13;
&#13;
                                  be a need for us to look in on this issue at some other time.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Second, while the paper sets out a useful analytical&#13;
&#13;
                                  framework, its operational implications aren't immediately&#13;
&#13;
                                  evident.   To understand this dimension, I personally would&#13;
&#13;
                                  like to be sure that I see whatever information is dissemiÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                                  nated within the institution in whatever form that may take.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Third, I would recommend that the key messages to&#13;
&#13;
                                  staff should be drawn not just from this paper, but also from&#13;
&#13;
                                  the paper on public sector management reform which follows&#13;
&#13;
                                  later this afternoon.&#13;

&#13;
                                       Very briefly--we don't want to repeat what has been&#13;
&#13;
                             said today--we agree with what most of you have said.       We&#13;
&#13;
                             want to acknowledge the contribution of this paper, as&#13;
&#13;
                             someone said, to a complex and difficult subject.      It is a&#13;
&#13;
                             good one and very well-written, and clearly fits within the&#13;
&#13;
                             framework outlined for ourselves in the April discussions.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It is, in our view, reaffirming that the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
                             approach to governance issues is not unduly legalistic.          On&#13;
&#13;
                             the contrary, these are complex matters that require multidisÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             ciplinary studies which the Bank is willing to undertake in&#13;
&#13;
                             order to address some of the questions of this paper.       Thus,&#13;
&#13;
                             the relevance of the sentence in paragraph 75:      "Much&#13;
&#13;
                             uncharted territory remains, and current work could be&#13;
&#13;
                             extended in several directions."     We believe that there is a&#13;
&#13;
                             lot of work to be done.     This is a very good first paper, but&#13;
&#13;
                             we have to continue exploring in order to recognize and to&#13;
&#13;
                             internalize the different conditions of different countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Second, the definition given in this paper of&#13;
&#13;
                             governance is the manner in which power is exercised in the&#13;

                             development reflects, in our view, that technical consideraÂ­&#13;

                             tions of economy and efficiency, rather than ideological and&#13;
&#13;
                             political preferences, are the guiding principles in the&#13;
&#13;
                             Bank's work at all times.   In this sense, we also want to&#13;
&#13;
                             state that maybe the paper goes too much in terms of internal&#13;
&#13;
                             constraints versus external constraints.   That is, there is&#13;
&#13;
                             one side that the government can do, but there is also&#13;
&#13;
                             another side that is very important to consider and that has&#13;
&#13;
                             to do with what is the political and social environment, and&#13;
&#13;
                             what are the conditions that make that environment possible&#13;
&#13;
                             for governance.&#13;
&#13;
                                       In that respect, I want to raise a point that Ms.&#13;
&#13;
                             Herfkens has raised today and at some other times, with&#13;
&#13;
                             regard to the role of the Bank with regard to structural&#13;
&#13;
                             adjustment has to have another side--that is, the social&#13;
&#13;
                             development projects--that help to lessen the costs that are&#13;
&#13;
                             paid for the adjustment, especially by poor people.     We&#13;
&#13;
                             believe that in that way you can make easier that role, and&#13;
&#13;
                             you can make countries more governable, and you can really&#13;
&#13;
                             apply some of the things we are discussing today.     In a&#13;
&#13;
                             context where the costs are paid, in a democratic system, it&#13;
&#13;
                             is very, very hard to apply many of the things we have been&#13;
&#13;
                             discussing.   So I think I insist on that point that we have&#13;

                                lower-income groups.&#13;
&#13;
                                          There is one other issue, Mr. Chairman, that we&#13;
&#13;
                                strongly want to emphasize, and it is clear and unequivocally&#13;
&#13;
                                transparent in the paper.   We are referring to the idea, as I&#13;
&#13;
                                said, of political stability as a prerequisite for economic&#13;
&#13;
                                development and the fact that it recognizes that different&#13;
&#13;
                                systems can and should coexist with the Bank.     Therefore we&#13;
&#13;
                                wish to insist on what is said in paragraph 18:     the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                "needs to assist in the design of highly differentiated&#13;
&#13;
                                responses, taking account of the country's institutional&#13;
&#13;
                                needs, its political economy, its society, and history," as&#13;
&#13;
                                well as what is said in paragraph 23, where it says a long-&#13;
&#13;
                                term approach is needed to help "build ownership of adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                                programs, a more conscious effort to understand the political&#13;
&#13;
                                and social structures and the customs and laws of its&#13;
&#13;
                                borrower; the need to foster an 'implementation culture'&#13;
&#13;
                                within the Bank and to sensitize staff to the need to handle&#13;
&#13;
                                issues in this area with humility, sensitivity and caution."&#13;
&#13;
                                          We believe that positions like this, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
                                can only help to reinforce the fact that one of the most&#13;
&#13;
                                important assets this institution has is its pluralism.&#13;

&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Are there further comments or questions?&#13;

&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     If not, with some humility~ I'll try&#13;
&#13;
                             to sum up briefly what have been rather long remarks.&#13;
&#13;
                                          We have had a comprehensive and serious discussion.&#13;
&#13;
                             Governance is becoming the subject of a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
                             international debate among donors and within developing&#13;
&#13;
                             countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                          This paper and today's discussion have been&#13;
&#13;
                             particularly timely, and I am grateful for the thoughtfulness&#13;
&#13;
                             of Directors' interventions.&#13;
&#13;
                                          This is a discussion paper as many of you have&#13;
&#13;
                             noted, and we are not putting specific proposals for your&#13;
&#13;
                             endorsement.     Nevertheless I think there has been broad&#13;
&#13;
                             support for the approach the paper takes.        We have carefully&#13;
&#13;
                             noted the concerns and comments Directors have expressed and&#13;
&#13;
                             specific points Directors have put to us.        These views&#13;
&#13;
                             expressed will be reflected in the dissemination of the paper&#13;
&#13;
                             to Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
                                          While some Directors have more emphasized the need&#13;
&#13;
                             for caution mentioned in the paper and others the need for&#13;

&#13;
                                          Mr. Lateef has reminded you in his remarks about&#13;
&#13;
                                the next steps proposed at the end of the paper.    I would&#13;
&#13;
                                emphasize that governance applies to all regions.    This is&#13;
&#13;
                                not an Africa-only initiative.    We have heard your concern&#13;
&#13;
                                about the level at which dialogue on sensitive matters should&#13;
&#13;
                                be conducted.    We will do our utmost to do our work on&#13;
&#13;
                                governance with humility and sensitivity, recognizing that&#13;
&#13;
                                some have questions about our relative comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
                                in this area.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Some of you have queried whether two years is too&#13;
&#13;
                                long to wait for a progress report.    I would like to see two&#13;
&#13;
                                years as the outer limit.    These are long-term problems.     We&#13;
&#13;
                                are saying that the Bank should proceed carefully and&#13;
&#13;
                                selectively.    We have noted your wish to be kept fully&#13;
&#13;
                                informed, and we will reconsider in another year or so if we&#13;
&#13;
                                have a meaningful body of experience to discuss with you&#13;
&#13;
                                sooner.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Are there comments or questions?&#13;
&#13;
                                          Yes, Mr. Potter.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. POTTER:    Let me preface this by saying that&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              this is not some kind of a suggestion that is akin to the&#13;
&#13;
                              sort of debates we've had about operational directives in&#13;
&#13;
                              certain areas--environment comes to mind and so on.    But I am&#13;
&#13;
                              curious as to how we disseminate this kind of thing.   How do&#13;
&#13;
                              we get people who are actually having to do the work senÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                              sitized to what it is we think we have talked about most of&#13;
&#13;
                              the day? H ow do you go about doing that?&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. CONABLE:   Mr. Isenman, what are the intentions&#13;
&#13;
                              of PRE on that?&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. ISENMAN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                                        First! I think this is something that applies Bank-&#13;
&#13;
                              wide and obviously particularly to Operations as well as PRE.&#13;
&#13;
                              In the first instance, we do plan to disseminate this paper&#13;
&#13;
                              along with I think the public sector management paper, with&#13;
&#13;
                              an appropriate set of notes about the views expressed by the&#13;
&#13;
                              Board here.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Second, we have in place already what has been I&#13;
&#13;
                              think an unusually effective Bank-wide group which has been&#13;
&#13;
                              working on this paper, and we intend to continue using this&#13;
&#13;
                              group--and in my mind not just for this initial phase of&#13;
&#13;
                              dissemination, but further, as this is a learning process&#13;
&#13;
                              that we are going through! this provides us a way--in fact,&#13;
&#13;
                              quite senior levels in some cases--for working effectively&#13;

&#13;
                             effort will in the dissemination process be having broader&#13;
&#13;
                             discussions, working through and with the people from that&#13;
&#13;
                             particular region who are on the task force, to try and get&#13;
&#13;
                             greater dissemination within each region.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. CONABLE:     Mr. Potter.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. POTTER:      This document, then, is the basic&#13;
&#13;
                             vehicle; is that it?&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. ISENMAN:      I didn't mean to say the document is,&#13;
&#13;
                             actually.    I think this is an ongoing learning process.         This&#13;
&#13;
                             document marks a stage, a synthesis, of where we are now, and&#13;
&#13;
                             I see this working group as not just the dissemination of the&#13;
&#13;
                             document, but a learning group to continue this broader&#13;
&#13;
                             effort.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. CONABLE:     Tell us about the task force that you&#13;
&#13;
                             re talking about.      It is being conducted on a cross-complex&#13;
&#13;
                             basis, is it not?&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR.   ISENMAN:    It indeed has-Â­&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. CONABLE:     And let me ask you this.   There are&#13;
&#13;
                             members of the Board who are quite sensitive about this area&#13;
&#13;
                             and who are going to be watching the dialogue between Bank&#13;
&#13;
                             staff and their respective countries and are concerned that&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                       There are going to be other countries that are&#13;
&#13;
                             going to be concerned about aspects of governance among Bank&#13;
  .Â­                         member countries.     Can Board members come to members of the&#13;
&#13;
                             task force and report concerns that they have?     It would be&#13;
&#13;
                             important that we have some kind of ongoing dialogue about&#13;
&#13;
                             it, I should think.     If such a thing were possible, it might&#13;
&#13;
                             be reassuring to the Board members who have expressed concern&#13;
&#13;
                             about this area of sensitivity.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Mr. Thalwitz.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. THALWITZ:     Let me just say one word in response&#13;
&#13;
                             to Mr. Potter.    I think one of your concerns is to make sure&#13;
&#13;
                             that this paper in fact forms the basis for the process of&#13;
&#13;
                             staff education--I don't know whether I'm putting this rightÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             -and let me reassure you on this.    This is a lot of intellecÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tual work that has gone into this.    There is very careful&#13;
&#13;
                             delineation even in the definition of the three specific&#13;
&#13;
                             areas in which we detect at this stage competence and need to&#13;
&#13;
                             act.&#13;
&#13;
                                       And I think in answer to your question essentially&#13;
&#13;
                             is that in any kind of dissemination process that work that is&#13;
&#13;
                             contained in this report should of course not be lost, and it&#13;
&#13;
                             is the basis for this dissemination effort of which Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Isenman speaks.&#13;

&amp;#12;            ah                                                                           121&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Beyond that--and this is not incompatible with it-Â­&#13;
&#13;
                              a task force that is an instrument of dissemination, as we&#13;
&#13;
                              look one or two years down, for reporting back on achieveÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                              ments, you need an instrument that continues this intellectual&#13;
&#13;
                              work so this task force has essentially two functions.     It&#13;
&#13;
                              has the one of taking this where we have gotten today, where&#13;
&#13;
                              we have some understanding with the Board, some reflection of&#13;
&#13;
                              today's results, to be disseminated to the staff, and then an&#13;
&#13;
                              instrument, a center from which experience can be gathered&#13;
&#13;
                              and analyzed as we go into the next stages.&#13;
&#13;
                                         But I wanted to reassure you that it is important&#13;
&#13;
                              that the paper you have in front of you is indeed the basis&#13;
&#13;
                              for the attitudes that we are trying to put into the staff.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. CONABLE:   I call your attention to page 51 of&#13;
&#13;
                              the report where the names of the Task Force on Governance&#13;
&#13;
                              are listed.   And this is going to continue for at least a&#13;
&#13;
                              period of time before a report back; is that correct, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                              Isenman?&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. ISENMAN:   Yes.   It seems to me that, as Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                              Lateef said, we haven't made a definite decision for the&#13;
&#13;
                              longer run, but it strikes me that this is a learning&#13;
&#13;
                              process.   It is very useful to consider this committee now as&#13;
&#13;
                              in existence until disbanded.&#13;

&amp;#12;             ah                                                                               122&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                          The composition will change over time, and as you&#13;
&#13;
                             said, Mr. President, members of the Board can speak to&#13;
&#13;
                             members of the committee or I think also to the established&#13;
&#13;
                             management structure dealing with the particular countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     Yes, obviously the establishment of a&#13;
&#13;
                              structure is appropriate, too.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Mr. ISENMAN:     And I think if you look at that list&#13;
&#13;
                             you referred to on page 51-Â­&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     You'll find it very representative.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. ISENMAN:     --it is very representative.     And we&#13;
&#13;
                             have had very senior assistance from the Legal Department,&#13;
&#13;
                             for example, at all levels of this, and senior management&#13;
&#13;
                             have taken quite an interest in this important area, and I'm&#13;
&#13;
                             quite sure that that interest is going to continue.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     Mr. Potter, do you have any suggesÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                             tions?&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. POTTER:     No.   I wasn't so much worried about&#13;
&#13;
                             how the process goes on here.         I mean, we all recognize this&#13;
&#13;
                             is not a-Â­&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:     It must go on and there must be&#13;
&#13;
                             continuing dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. THALWITZ:     Yes/ how we use what we have.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. POTTER:     We all understand this is going to be&#13;

&amp;#12;            ah                                                                           123&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              the subject of more attention.     I was just curious as to how&#13;
&#13;
                              we convey the delicacies and subtleties and nuances of&#13;
&#13;
                              something like this in such a big, complicated place as the&#13;
&#13;
                              Bank.   It is not a complicated question--it is a complicated&#13;
&#13;
                              execution, but it is not a complicated question.&#13;
&#13;
                                        MR. CONABLE:    Well, ultimately, you must hold the&#13;
&#13;
                              management responsible for an appropriate implementation of&#13;
&#13;
                              this general concern which is closely related to our basic&#13;
&#13;
                              development function, and it must be done with sensitivity&#13;
&#13;
                              and with effectiveness.     I think you must expect the manageÂ­&#13;
&#13;
                              ment to implement this with due regard for the views of the&#13;
&#13;
                              Board and the concerns that have been expressed here.&#13;
&#13;
                                        All right.     Thank you very much.&#13;
