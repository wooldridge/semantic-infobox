&#13;
KRASKE: I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
MILOBSKY: I am David Milobsky, the assistant to the historian.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I'm John Blaxall, the interviewee.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Thanks, John, for agreeing to this interview. It's a great pleasure to see you here. Why don't we start&#13;
by having you describe your background: how did you come to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I studied at the University of Birmingham in England. I originally wanted to be an&#13;
accountant. In England, being a Chartered Accountant was something like being a lawyer in the&#13;
U.S.; it gave you access to a business career. After one semester of accounting, however, I&#13;
realized that it was not my life's work, and I switched to economics. I graduated with a Bachelor&#13;
of Commerce degree, with a focus on economics.&#13;
&#13;
After graduation, I worked for a year overseas in Iran. It was an internship sponsored by the&#13;
Friends Service Council (Quakers). I worked in the UNTAB [United Nations Technical&#13;
Assistance Board, predecessor of the UN Development Program] office in Teheran. It was there&#13;
that I first became aware of the World Bank, which had an important presence in Iran at that&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
My Iran experience encouraged me to go to graduate school in the U.S. to study development&#13;
economics. Partly on the recommendation of the man I was working for, the UN Res Rep&#13;
[resident representative], Dan [Daniel K.] Hopkinson, I went to the Fletcher School of Law and&#13;
Diplomacy at Tufts University. A fair number of Bank people actually have come from that&#13;
school, but I didn't know that at the time. I studied at the Fletcher School for a couple of years&#13;
and earned my masters degree there. I enjoyed it very much; it had the advantages of a small&#13;
school, but because it was linked to other universities in the area such as Harvard and MIT, I had&#13;
a large resource base to draw from.&#13;
&#13;
While I was at the Fletcher School, I heard more about the World Bank and its Young&#13;
Professionals program. I applied for the Young Professionals program in 1965. I was not&#13;
accepted, but the Bank encouraged me to reapply, so I worked for a year in Cambridge,&#13;
Massachusetts, for Abt Associates, a newly established consulting firm doing some very&#13;
interesting work on games and simulations and systems analysis. At the time, this was all the&#13;
rage, especially at the U.S. Department of Defense. My boss, Clark Abt, wanted to apply systems&#13;
analysis techniques to the social sciences. It was a very exciting and stimulating assignment. In&#13;
the meantime, I applied again to the Bank and was accepted and actually came to the Bank as a&#13;
YP in October 1966.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Your work at the Fletcher School, was that related to development?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              John Blaxall&#13;
                                       June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes. My studies were primarily in international economics and development&#13;
economics. I also learned things that Iâ&#128;&#153;d never known about American diplomatic history, and&#13;
international law, but I concentrated mainly on development economics.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So in other words, ever since your time in Teheran you were sort of steeped in development&#13;
economics and development problems?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Exactly. I suppose I became a â&#128;&#156;missionaryâ&#128;? early on in my adult life.&#13;
&#13;
So I came to Washington in October of 1966. In those days the newly recruited YPs all came as&#13;
a group, as youâ&#128;&#153;ll remember, Jochen. And they put all of us up at the Dupont Plaza Hotel. And I&#13;
remember we complained; we said, â&#128;&#156;There are lots of hotels that are closer to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s offices&#13;
than that. Why do you put us in this crummy place?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And the response wasâ&#128;&#148;and this was in 1966--â&#128;&#156;Look, that is one hotel in Washington where we&#13;
know that our staff will not be discriminated against. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t matter what color they are; we&#13;
know that theyâ&#128;&#153;ll get service in that hotel.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
That tells you what Washington was like in those days.&#13;
&#13;
Q: A sign of the times.&#13;
&#13;
Who were the other members of your group? Do you remember any of their names?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Sure. Among them were David Dunn; Don [Donald T.]Brash, whoâ&#128;&#153;s now the&#13;
Governor of New Zealandâ&#128;&#153;s Reserve Bank; Louis Pouliquen, who I work with now; Gary&#13;
Luhman; Tariq Husain; Fernando Mendoza.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Joe [D. Joseph] Wood, was he part of your group?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Joe Wood was not. He was the group after us, I think.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So, by and large, your group also has remained pretty much intact. The people who left have&#13;
been the exception.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Not exactly. The continental Europeans, you know, the French, tend to leave for&#13;
various reasons--except for Louis, of course--but Bernard Siret left after two or three years;&#13;
Francesco Abatte, from Italy, left not so long ago; Jean Pierre Amselle, who subsequently moved&#13;
to the Fund. Davison Budhoo from Grenada was in our group; he also moved to the Fund and&#13;
then wrote some nasty things about both institutions. John Lowe was an American who left fairly&#13;
early on. Arun Shourie was in our group, I think; he left after a couple of years and became a&#13;
prolific writer and political commentator in India.&#13;
&#13;
But at the beginning there were, I suppose, 16 or so in the group. And in those days they&#13;
organized an orientation program for the whole group, lasting three or four weeks. And then&#13;
they said, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ve started something new this time; we are going to send people to language&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Blaxall&#13;
                                   June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
training. Who wants to go to language training?â&#128;? So I suppose there must have been eight or ten&#13;
of us who went off to intensive Spanish training, eight hours a day, using the U.S. Foreign&#13;
Service method. But because the Bank at that time didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a language lab, we went to&#13;
Georgetown University. And for what must have been two or three months, we spent every day&#13;
learning Spanish. Then when we completed that, the Bank of course sent all of us to work on&#13;
countries and sectors where we didnâ&#128;&#153;t need Spanish. I think they realized that this was not the&#13;
best approach to language training, and eventually the Bank set up in-house language courses for&#13;
staff with a â&#128;&#156;work-related need.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Q: What were some of your early assignments?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I worked with Duncan Ballantineâ&#128;&#153;s Education Division. I also worked with Bill&#13;
[William] Diamond's Development Finance Companies Division.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Which was then still part of IFC [International Finance Corporation].&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Exactly, it was part of IFC. In fact, I worked mostly with Alistair Morton, who is&#13;
now the man who runs the Chunnel project.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you remember when [Robert S.] McNamara came to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I was on mission in Trinidad for the Education Division in December 1967 when&#13;
we heard on the radio that McNamara had accepted the position of President of the World Bank&#13;
starting in April 1968. I remember being very pleased at the time because it seemed to me that&#13;
McNamara was somebody who would lend impetus, drive and energy to the institution. He had a&#13;
tremendous reputation. I had done some work in the area of systems analysis earlier while&#13;
working at the consulting firm; I had read some of his works and was generally familiar with&#13;
what he was doing at the Defense Department.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did his association with the Vietnam War bother you at the time?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: No. It didn't. I would have to describe myself as a hawk on Vietnam at the time. I&#13;
believed in the â&#128;&#156;domino theoryâ&#128;? prevalent in those days. I was not an avid militarist, but I was&#13;
not a war protester either. I certainly didn't feel that it was inappropriate for him to be the Bank's&#13;
president. In fact, I thought that he would give some energy and kick to this institution, which by&#13;
then I was finding a rather stuffy place.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you feel that a lot of your colleagues had similar views?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I don't think I was alone, but I think that I was perhaps more in touch with what I&#13;
considered to be the good side of McNamara--the innovations that he'd introduced, his&#13;
management style, and the way that he had refocused the Pentagon. I wouldn't say he was&#13;
exactly a hero to me, but certainly our ways of thinking were not dissimilar. I remember Clark&#13;
Abt used to accuse me of being a Benthamite, a utilitarian. I was always preoccupied with&#13;
assessing expected value very carefully and looking at things rationally. I willingly accepted Mr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            John Blaxall&#13;
                                     June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Abtâ&#128;&#153;s label. That method of detached reasoning brought me significant success in my education&#13;
and in my early career. So I was very pleased about the appointment.&#13;
&#13;
And I was then coming to the end of my third YP assignment (in those days YPs went through&#13;
three assignments of roughly six months each). I had two full assignments, but because the&#13;
Spanish language training took up two or three months, I had a short third assignment with Mike&#13;
[Michael L.] Lejeune in the East Africa Division. One of the options that YPs had in those days-&#13;
-it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t very well organized, but what happened was that there would be a list of possible&#13;
openings for what we called â&#128;&#156;permanent assignments.â&#128;? Since we all came to the end of our YP&#13;
assignments at roughly the same time, the group that had joined at a particular moment could&#13;
consider various options. There was a certain amount of exploring, seeing where youâ&#128;&#153;d fit in,&#13;
and interviewing people and so on. I remember there were two possibilities which I looked at&#13;
quite carefully, one of which was working with Bob [Robert] Sadove, who was just about to start&#13;
a Tourism Division in the Projects Department--or he had just started it and was looking for&#13;
people, and I remember talking to him.&#13;
&#13;
The other option, and the one I chose after my YP rotation period ended, was a position in the&#13;
Program Evaluation and Control Department. As far as I could tell, the Program Evaluation and&#13;
Control Department was a creation of George Woods, which, not to be too unkind, had been set&#13;
up mainly so that when the Board [of Executive Directors] asked embarrassing questions about&#13;
how much was being spent on something or other, the President could say, â&#128;&#156;Oh, don't worry&#13;
about a thing. I'll have the Program Evaluation and Control Department look into that.â&#128;?&#13;
Whatever its origins, PEC had acquired the budget function (previously part of the financial&#13;
staff) and some analytical capabilities clustered around budget review. I made a guess that when&#13;
McNamara came to the World Bank, he would pay a lot of attention to the budget and would use&#13;
it as a mechanism for running the institution. That wasn't very hard to guess if you'd seen&#13;
anything of his work at the Pentagon. I said to myself, â&#128;&#156;Well, this actually could be rather&#13;
interesting for this initial period of McNamara's involvement in the Bank. Why donâ&#128;&#153;t I jump into&#13;
this and see what happens?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Q: How large a department was that at the time?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I suppose there were a dozen people. Horst Eschenberg was there; Mike [Michael&#13;
E.] Ruddy was there; Laura Fabietti and two colleagues who came from the Budget Unit. It canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
have been more than about a dozen people, with John Williams as the Director.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What kind of a person was he, because heâ&#128;&#153;s not the sort of person that you would associate&#13;
with, you know, being in charge of making the budget and controlling accounts and this sort of&#13;
stuff?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. John Williams is a wonderfully erudite man. You could have a&#13;
discussion with John in which he would ramble off into all kinds of digressions, but then heâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
always finally get back to the main point. I enjoyed working with John. I found him a very&#13;
decent and a very capable person, although not, as you say, particularly well-suited to the job&#13;
that he had at that time. And I think subsequently that became clearer, and he was very&#13;
concerned and distressed about that, actually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Blaxall&#13;
                                   June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Had he beenâ&#128;&#148;I mean, do you know whether he had asked for this job or was he sort of&#13;
dumped there by Woods?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. I really donâ&#128;&#153;t know how it happened. All I know is he was there at&#13;
the time I joined the department.&#13;
&#13;
I started in March 1968, and on the 3rd or 4th of April, I got a call from Hugh Ripman, who was&#13;
head of the Bank's Personnel and Administration at that time. He explained to me that Mr.&#13;
McNamara had now arrived and needed somebody to help him pull together some information.&#13;
Since this was, on the face of it, something which the Program Evaluation and Control&#13;
Department was responsible for and since I was new there and did not have a precise set of&#13;
responsibilities and since I was the right age to be a â&#128;&#156;runner,â&#128;? Mr. Ripman suggested me for the&#13;
job, presumably in consultation with John Williams.&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact, I will always remember my embarrassment because I had shortly before&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#148;I think in March or Februaryâ&#128;&#148;ordered some new glasses. I used to wear English-style&#13;
horn-rimmed glasses with a horn-rim top and an empty bottom, and Iâ&#128;&#153;d ordered some new&#13;
rimless glasses which were, I suppose, a sign of my enthusiasm for McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s ways. And I&#13;
remember my embarrassment and thinking, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to go to this manâ&#128;&#153;s office, and the first&#13;
thing heâ&#128;&#153;s going to notice is that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve copied his glasses!â&#128;? Of course, when I ordered them I had&#13;
no idea that I would ever see him, and I remember actually putting on the old glasses in order to&#13;
avoid the problem!&#13;
&#13;
In any case, on the appointed day I went up to McNamara's office, and he dealt with me very&#13;
characteristically. He had in front of him a white sheet of paper (he always worked on white,&#13;
lined, 8 1/2 x 11 pieces of paper--he never used the Bank's standard yellow pads). On it, in&#13;
pencil, he had written the outlines of a tabular format, with years across the top and row titles&#13;
down the side. The first format that he wanted me to fill in was one showing the Bank's balance&#13;
sheet for the last five years. He asked me when I could have it ready, and he wrote down my&#13;
answer. I had no idea when I could get it done, but I was prepared to work hard, and I did work&#13;
hard.&#13;
&#13;
I then rushed off to the Controller's Department and tried to put these numbers together. The first&#13;
thing I discovered was that there was no single place where one could get all these figures.&#13;
Eventually, I looked at each successive annual report of the Bank and recast the numbers in the&#13;
right format. I took the completed table back to McNamara, and he looked at this and said it was&#13;
very interesting. He rearranged the lines a little bit, merged together two lines and brought&#13;
something from the liability side as a deduction from assets, and then asked me to do an income&#13;
statement and a cash flow at the same time. I went away and did that, again with help from the&#13;
Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s Department, and soon enough, he had a statement which showed on one page for the&#13;
last five years the balance sheet and accounts of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Those original tables later became a component of the â&#128;&#156;Standard Tables,â&#128;? but at this stage they&#13;
did not have any name. By April 18, these tables had moved from his white paper scribbled in&#13;
pencil, to my big green pads written in pencil which he would go over and correct and modify, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a table typed and printed showing data for the last five years. At that stage the next five years on&#13;
the tables were shown as blank columns, at his instructions. This was, of course, in the days&#13;
before computers and office copiers; everything was prepared on green pads, typed on a wide-&#13;
carriage Selectric typewriter, and sent to the print-shop for photo-reduction and printing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, did you have the impression that this was really the first time that heâ&#128;&#153;d looked at these&#13;
numbers?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I think a lot of it was first-time learning, Jochen, simply because I don't think that&#13;
he could have put those numbers together. I had trouble finding some of them. By looking at the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s annual reports, he could have gained some sense of the size of the organization and its&#13;
financial position. He was good at looking at financials. However, it wasn't until he saw these&#13;
numbers in rows, as it were, that he could really see what was going on and trends over time.&#13;
&#13;
I would go away and labor all night long to put together a huge green pad table, and he would&#13;
look at it and within 10 seconds say, â&#128;&#156;This number is wrong.â&#128;? He has an uncanny ability to spot&#13;
errors. Now, what I learned subsequently and managed to emulate to some extent, is that of&#13;
course if you look at a row of numbers, when you find any discontinuity, thereâ&#128;&#153;s a good chance&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s wrong. But he also has an amazing ability to look at masses of data and identify&#13;
developments and trends.&#13;
&#13;
Remember, Jochen, that McNamara designed his tables himself. When I put the numbers in front&#13;
of him, he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t just looking at a massive array of numbers. The data fitted into categories that&#13;
he'd already been through in his own mind, and consequently it was very easy for him to absorb&#13;
the information. He was, of course, famed for his ability to suck in, to vacuum in information,&#13;
but it was partly because of these (if you like) tricks or techniques.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did he ever tell you why he was doing this? Why did he feel that this information was&#13;
significant?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes, he did, at two different levels. One is--and this is something which I&#13;
remember made an enormous impact on me at the time--that he was clearly interested. These&#13;
numbers meant something to him. I remember standing at his shoulder while I was presenting&#13;
some numbers to him--which is the way that we would work; he would sit at his desk, writing&#13;
left-handed with his pencil and pointing out things. And he said to me, â&#128;&#156;John, this is really&#13;
exciting.â&#128;? That was the first time I'd heard that word in the Bank. â&#128;&#156;Excitingâ&#128;? was not a concept&#13;
that one associated with the World Bank. He really was engaged; he was really committed to&#13;
understanding what was going on and changing it.&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing is that McNamara clearly had a big agenda. He had a big black book (3-ring&#13;
binder) he used to keep with the latest version of each table, and at the back of it was a sort of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;To Doâ&#128;? list, and there he had a whole series of things that he wanted to look into, and he would&#13;
update that from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You would see these â&#128;&#156;To Doâ&#128;? lists?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Occasionally, because he would give me the black book because heâ&#128;&#153;d want the&#13;
tables updated. I made it a point never to mention what I saw, and I certainly didnâ&#128;&#153;t make copies&#13;
of anything, but I did occasionally see what heâ&#128;&#153;d written in notes to himself about things that&#13;
needed to be done and even on some occasions people that he thought ought to be moving and so&#13;
on. Not very often, but I caught a glimpse occasionally of those kinds of things.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you know how often he was doing these lists?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t, because he didnâ&#128;&#153;t give me his black book very often. But he used to&#13;
keep the list, and he would tick things off and write new things on it. I honestly donâ&#128;&#153;t know how&#13;
often he did it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How often did he ask you to update the figures?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Well, in the early days it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a matter of updating; it was fiddling with, cleaning&#13;
the data, rearranging lines, condensing into the most compact form possible, with a minimum of&#13;
white space. One of hisâ&#128;&#148;I almost said â&#128;&#156;fetishesâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;one of his preoccupations was to have things&#13;
in a tabular format which was compact enough to be all on one page. He wanted all of the data&#13;
on a particular subject on one page, but at the same time he also wanted a vertical orientation so&#13;
that he didnâ&#128;&#153;t have to turn the black book sideways. So when we presented wide tables to him,&#13;
we would have a fold-over, even two folds in the sheets. But then we would cut out the top&#13;
corner of the page so that when the fold-over covered what was on the page, you could still see&#13;
the title underneath. And everything was three-hole punched so that it could go straight into his&#13;
black book. And these were thing that he was very meticulous about: even the question of&#13;
whether there should be lines between columns or not, whether there should be double lines&#13;
under the totals or above totals, or whether you should have a total at the top or at the bottom of a&#13;
column. He had very clear views about all these things, and he wanted to see it in the way he&#13;
wanted to see it. And that was fine with me.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, tell us a little more about these various tables. You started with a balance sheet and a&#13;
profit and loss statement.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: The next one was on borrowing, yields on new issues, and amounts borrowed and&#13;
repaid by market, again with the next five years blank. After that came a table showing&#13;
commitments by country and another showing disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How did the staff react when he introduced the tables to them?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Towards the end of April 1968, McNamara presented the senior staff with the&#13;
tables showing actual data for the last five years, with blank columns for the next five years, and&#13;
told them to fill in the blanks. The reaction to this request was mild outrage. The senior staff&#13;
didn't see how they could predict lending levels. They also felt that if they started saying how&#13;
much they wanted to lend, they would eliminate any leverage they had on any borrower. In their&#13;
view, banks didn't behave that way. They seized opportunities, perhaps, but they certainly didn't&#13;
go out ahead of time and tell people what they were going to do. It all depended on the state of&#13;
the market and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McNamara listened to all of this, and said, â&#128;&#156;Yes, fine, I understand all that, but let's do it&#13;
anyhow. Give me your best estimate, and we'll refine it later. I don't want to wait two months or&#13;
six months to get a better estimate. I want it by next week, and then we'll spend time on refining&#13;
it and improving it.â&#128;? McNamara wanted consistency. He was looking for consistency among the&#13;
financial statements, the commitment levels, and the disbursement and borrowing levels, so that&#13;
we had, in effect, a plan.&#13;
&#13;
During that early period, I remember distinctly that one of the early exercises was determining&#13;
how much we were going to lend country by country. The area departments put up their plan,&#13;
and the projects divisions put up their plan. Needless to say, the two plans weren't very similar.&#13;
At that moment McNamara said, â&#128;&#156;Look, this is exactly the point. We want one plan around here.&#13;
We want to have one set of information.â&#128;? He used the phrase that the Bank needed to have one&#13;
sheet of music that everyone played from. He converted the old PEC Department into a new&#13;
Programming and Budgeting Department to take on the responsibility of bringing that material&#13;
together and ensuring that there was one set of consistent numbers. He did not want P&amp;B to&#13;
invent the numbers, but to make sure that they were consistent and coherent. And those numbers&#13;
were assembled in what subsequently became the Standard Tables. All of this material was&#13;
recorded in a set of Standard Tables which were updated on varying cycles. And that started in&#13;
June of 1968.&#13;
&#13;
So, in the period between April 1st and June 1968, McNamara had constructed a five-year plan.&#13;
It was quick and dirty and perhaps not as refined as many people would have liked, but it was a&#13;
five-year plan.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So this was a plan which covered both the fundraising side and the commitment side, with&#13;
commitments broken down by country and also by sector, I suppose?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes. The original country lending programs, or commitment programs, were&#13;
really very crude. They werenâ&#128;&#153;t project titles; they were just power so much, agriculture so&#13;
much, et cetera, under each country.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So the initial set of Standard Tables covered all this five-year lending information, in&#13;
addition to the basic data on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s balance sheet and financial condition and so on and so&#13;
forth. Was there anything else? Were there any figures in these tables about the needs of the&#13;
developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: No. The document entitled â&#128;&#156;Five-Year Programâ&#128;? dated June 19, 1968, had chapter&#13;
headings such as â&#128;&#156;Forecast of Lending Operations,â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Changes in the Portfolio,â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Protected&#13;
Capital Flows, Development.â&#128;? And it was really not based on OECD DAC [Organization for&#13;
Economic Co-operation and Development, Development Assistance Committee] analysis, and it&#13;
was not based on a real â&#128;&#156;needs analysis.â&#128;? It was what the staff of the Bank said would be sensible&#13;
things to do if resources were no problem.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did McNamara's ambitious lending targets perhaps encourage the Bank to lend beyond its&#13;
means?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: McNamara's attitude throughout this period, and indeed subsequently, was that he&#13;
would find the resources to fund good programs. He believed (and he proved right) that the Bank&#13;
could borrow whatever it needed to borrow, and he wanted the staff to find sensible projects to&#13;
receive funding. That was the basis of this original plan.&#13;
&#13;
By June 1968, the Standard Tables had titles and reference numbers that would remain in effect.&#13;
Table 1 and its associated tables, for example, showed country by country lending volumes.&#13;
Table 2 showed the loans outstanding, country by country, and so on. The Table 3 series dealt&#13;
with borrowings, and the Table 4 series with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements, which had been&#13;
worked up earlier but now projected out for five years, sources and applications of funds and&#13;
what have you. There was even a table of staff requirements (I think it was Table 5) showing a&#13;
total â&#128;&#156;professionalâ&#128;? staff in 1968 of 720 and a requirement by 1973 of 1528, more than doubling.&#13;
In reality, I think the numbers were even higher by 1973.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I remember you mentioned that there was some initial resistance when McNamara originally&#13;
asked for these five-year projections. After these things actually became reality, what was the&#13;
reaction? Were people excited when they actually saw these things laid out in front of them, or&#13;
did some of that resistance linger on?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Oh, I think the resistance certainly lingered on, particularly in the early days when&#13;
people regarded this as a bit fanatical, not terribly helpful, and certainly not Bank-like.&#13;
Obviously, there were some people who thought it was a terrific idea, but I think that was a clear&#13;
minority.&#13;
&#13;
Although most people in the Bank felt that the institution needed to be shaken up a bit, they&#13;
certainly criticized McNamara's preoccupation with numbers. The epithet that was used a lot was&#13;
â&#128;&#156;the body count,â&#128;? which of course came from Vietnam. That was present at the outset and it was&#13;
present later. I think it became even more of a criticism later because we started getting into the&#13;
same kinds of phenomena, the same issues of predictions versus promises, and efforts to set up&#13;
lending programs country by country, project by project. One could concede that, in the&#13;
aggregate, the Bank should plan to disburse so much year by year or for the next five years or ten&#13;
years; however, when you started talking about what we were going to do in Kenya or what we&#13;
were going to do in Turkey, in which sectors, and precisely how those things are going to happen&#13;
over the next five years, I think it generated even more resistance later.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, of course, people were also seeing the benefits of the rapid expansion in&#13;
operations which, among other things, certainly catapulted the Bank into a much more powerful&#13;
position vis-a-vis the other aid donors and vis-a-vis the governments that received Bank funds,&#13;
so there were some offsetting advantages.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You started with McNamara in April of '68, and you put together these tables. How did this&#13;
relationship continue afterwards?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: In June 1968, McNamara announced that in order to keep this planning system&#13;
running, he would revamp the Program Evaluation and Control Department into what was called&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Programming and Budgeting Department. John Williams, the Director of PEC, was shoved&#13;
aside, and John Adler, who had been appointed John Williams' deputy in April or May, took over&#13;
as Director of the new P&amp;B Department.&#13;
&#13;
John Adler was an economist who had been the Director of EDI [Economic Development&#13;
Institute] and a senior staff member in the Economics complex. I am not quite sure, but I think&#13;
his work with Irving Friedman involved him in the initial five-year plan preparation exercise. I&#13;
think Adler appealed to McNamara because of his enthusiasm and his willingness to get on with&#13;
things, without questioning too deeply whether philosophically this was the right thing to do--&#13;
which would have been John Williamsâ&#128;&#153; reaction. John Adlerâ&#128;&#153;s approach was to just get on with&#13;
it and promise he could do it in half the time; John was a great one for committing and over-&#13;
committing his staff. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t think anybody resented that because he was a very attractive&#13;
character, a man whom I had enormous affection for, and we worked for him very hard.&#13;
&#13;
Q: He was a popular manager?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think people would say John Adler was the worldâ&#128;&#153;s greatest manager. He&#13;
was an extraordinarily decent human being, albeit with flaws like anybody else. But I think the&#13;
people who worked for himâ&#128;&#148;and some of the people who worked for John in those years were&#13;
Francis Colaco, Don Brash, Chris [Christopher R.] Willoughby, Arturo Israel, Joe Wood,&#13;
Stephen Eccles, Horst Schulmann, Everardo Wessels, a raft of people who spent time in P&amp;B&#13;
and, I think, all had a real affection for John, even though we found him irascible sometimes.&#13;
&#13;
He was very over-awed, I would say, by McNamara and tremendously loyal, and he would come&#13;
back from a meeting with McNamara and say, â&#128;&#156;The boss wants to have a table by next Thursday.&#13;
I told him we could do it.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And weâ&#128;&#153;d all say, â&#128;&#156;Oh, my god! John, you know how hard thatâ&#128;&#153;s going to be.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well,â&#128;? he would say, â&#128;&#156;but he wanted it, he wanted it.â&#128;? And so sometimes weâ&#128;&#153;d be there all&#13;
night.&#13;
&#13;
And in the end we didnâ&#128;&#153;t resent it particularly. It was a period of excitement and of fun, and we&#13;
felt that we wereâ&#128;&#148;and this was a phrase that Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure whether McNamara used, but itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
phrase that we used at the timeâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;at the nerve center of the Bank.â&#128;? This was right at the heart of&#13;
what was going on in the institution.&#13;
&#13;
I don't think that McNamara intended to give a large amount of power to the Programming and&#13;
Budgeting Department. In fact, he told us explicitly not to use his name when we were pulling&#13;
information together from different parts of the Bank, and I think we honored that admonition.&#13;
But the reality is that we acquired an enormous amount of power simply because we were the&#13;
channel through which information went to the boss. Because we had access to McNamara,&#13;
people within the Bank viewed us as being powerful and tended to pay attention to us when we&#13;
asked for information or looked at the budget. Over the years, McNamara used the P&amp;B team for&#13;
a succession of new assignments. The initial one was putting this plan together and then making&#13;
a budget that would work. And McNamara needed a budget that would rationalize the substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          John Blaxall&#13;
                                   June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
growth he planned in the Bank's activities and staff, in terms of the work program, in a logical,&#13;
coherent, and systematic fashion.&#13;
&#13;
Subsequently, when it came to operations evaluation, the first effort in that direction was a small&#13;
unit in P&amp;B under Chris Willoughby which undertook the initial operations evaluation studies. It&#13;
was eventually hived off into a separate department and now has an independent status. The&#13;
initial work on creditworthiness analysis was done in that same way and subsequently hived off.&#13;
All of the staff work for the IDA [International Development Association] replenishments was&#13;
done by P&amp;B under Sir Denis Rickett. P&amp;B was a place where, if something was going to be&#13;
started off, that's where you tried it out. And we had bright people. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think people called us&#13;
â&#128;&#156;whiz kids,â&#128;? but it was the same sort of notion as OSD [U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense]&#13;
in the Pentagon. P&amp;B had bright people with a lot of ambition and a lot of drive. They were&#13;
virtually all people recruited inside the Bank (frequently former YPs).&#13;
&#13;
The Bank had enough of those people that you could get a lot done. And of course you could&#13;
also create a lot of resentment among the crustier, older people who regarded all of this as a flash&#13;
in the pan and predicted that we would undoubtedly get into trouble later. And indeed we did in&#13;
some areas, rural development for one.&#13;
&#13;
Q: There was one fellow that actually came with McNamara from the Pentagon. I think he was&#13;
the only one.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes. To my knowledge McNamara brought two people with him. He brought Peg&#13;
[Margaret S.] Stroud, his secretary, who was a very, very decent person and who stayed on, I&#13;
guess, until he retired.&#13;
&#13;
The other person was Robert Valtz. Robert had been one of the â&#128;&#156;whiz kidâ&#128;? types in the Office of&#13;
the Secretary of Defense (OSD) at the Pentagon. He came in as Deputy when John Adler took&#13;
over as the Director of P&amp;B, so it must have been the summer of 1968. Robert was looking for a&#13;
different assignment, and I imagine he talked to McNamara and asked him whether there was&#13;
anything in the World Bank. He always made it clear to us--and probably also to McNamara--&#13;
that he did not intend to stay long at the Bank. Robert actually stayed not more than 12 months, I&#13;
think.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: In that time he did a number of things which I think were very useful. In particular,&#13;
he started the process which led to the Country Program Papers. The first round of that must&#13;
have taken place early in 1969. We had a lending program in place for each country as part of the&#13;
larger five-year plan, and we then had a round of informal reviews between P&amp;B and the&#13;
respective area departments. At these meetings, the departments were supposed to establish the&#13;
rationales for their lending programs and defend them to P&amp;B staffers. This was a matter of great&#13;
upset to the area departments' senior staff, but that's what we did. The early rounds of those&#13;
meetings were not terribly productive, but the CPP (Country Program Paper) concept soon grew&#13;
out of those meetings. Chris Willoughby must have been asked to draft a set of instructions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
formalize this process which led to the famous CPPs. In sum, we had a lending program which&#13;
was pegged at a certain level and then rationalized in terms of an emerging strategy country by&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
At this point, a lot of resentment came out, because up until that time, the impact of the plan had&#13;
been on a macro level. A lot of numbers had been generated, but the impact had been on an&#13;
aggregate level, and this led to substantial claims for additional resources, which was generally&#13;
regarded as a good thing. The CPPs, on the other hand, were a different story. People started&#13;
prodding into individual staff members' areas of expertise, and they didn't like upstarts from&#13;
P&amp;B questioning their decisions. Suddenly they had to plan and justify everything that they were&#13;
doing, country by country.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But the interesting thing is that in one of McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;To Doâ&#128;? lists, dated May 25, 1968,&#13;
point number 84 is, â&#128;&#156;We must have a system which will allow us to kind of set the framework&#13;
for the allocation of resources without having to interfere in the actual implementation,â&#128;? which is&#13;
really the CPP idea.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
And, indeed, I remember when the idea of operations evaluation first came upâ&#128;&#148;I honestly canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
remember when it was, but I remember at a certain point in a strategy discussion with&#13;
McNamara about â&#128;&#156;What are we going to do next?â&#128;? I said something to the effect that â&#128;&#156;Thereâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
one piece thatâ&#128;&#153;s missing in this whole planning system: we need feedback from operations&#13;
evaluation.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And McNamara said, â&#128;&#156;No, no, John, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, but we canâ&#128;&#153;t do that until later. We are going to&#13;
do that later.â&#128;? And he added it on his â&#128;&#156;To Doâ&#128;? list.&#13;
&#13;
The point is he had a great amount of forethought and foresight about these things. He had a&#13;
clear view of what needed to be done, but he didnâ&#128;&#153;t try to do it all at once. He would move&#13;
things along at the pace that he thought was feasible. Of course, the pace that he thought was&#13;
feasible was a lot faster than most people thought was reasonable.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Getting back to your particular role, after your stint as a â&#128;&#156;runnerâ&#128;? what was your function?&#13;
What did you do then?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Well, the core activities of P&amp;B were always split between the budget function, on&#13;
the one hand, and what Iâ&#128;&#153;ll call the programming function. My focus was primarily on the latter.&#13;
There was always a lot of writing to be done: reports to the Board on the budget, on the next&#13;
yearâ&#128;&#153;s budget, on the lending program, and so on. Whenever a new U.S. Secretary of the&#13;
Treasury or Secretary of State was appointed, McNamara would send a briefing note about the&#13;
Bank and IDA. So there was a lot of that sort of material in production the whole time, as well as&#13;
continual generation of new information in response to McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s requests.&#13;
&#13;
I remember before he went to a DAC meeting, he wanted all of the data on which country had&#13;
given how much aid for the last five years and, needless to say, projections for the next five&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 13&#13;

&#13;
years. He would be able to stun any Minister of Finance by how much he knew about their aid&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
Robert Valtz left the department in 1969, and I replaced him as Deputy Director. That created a&#13;
great stir, because I must have been the youngest Deputy ever appointed in the Bank. I know, for&#13;
example, that Hugh Ripman strongly opposed my appointment. He pointed out, reasonably&#13;
enough, that this would not do any good for my career in the long term and that it would be&#13;
much more sensible to bring in somebody who was more seasoned. McNamara, however, said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, this is the way I want to do it.â&#128;? John Adler certainly supported him on that. I was good at&#13;
doing what McNamara wanted done. I was loyal, and I worked well with John.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But your function continued to be just going directly into McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s office whenever he&#13;
had some numbers problems? You were the person he would turn to?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes, at least initially. I suppose he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to waste time training anybody&#13;
else. That was at least for another couple of rounds. Of course, by the middle of 1969 the&#13;
format and content of most of those tables were fairly well established and after that his need&#13;
declined and, secondly, other people were beginning to take on those tasks. But during that first&#13;
period there were a lot of new tables put together, and in addition there was a lot of writing to&#13;
support and justify the material.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's first budget discussion with the Board had been in June of 1968, but the summer of&#13;
1969 was the first budget with his stamp on it, and he put an enormous amount of effort into it.&#13;
He wanted to justify the rapidly growing lending program and its associated costs. Since the&#13;
administrative budget was derived from activity levels, we had to devise an enormous number of&#13;
ratios and cost coefficients. This is where the famous "coefficients" emerged from. If supervision&#13;
in a particular sector costs eleven and a half staff weeks a year per project and you had this many&#13;
of them, then you multiply the numbers and you end up with the staffing requirement. During&#13;
that whole period from the summer of '68 through the summer of '69, an enormous amount of&#13;
effort went into designing "the program budget system," which evolved but had much the same&#13;
elements for the next 15 to 20 years.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So this is when you began to see how this control system was used by McNamara to run the&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: It was fairly clear to me right from the outset that this is what he was doing.&#13;
Already in July of 1968 we were sending memos to McNamara about how next yearâ&#128;&#153;s budget is&#13;
going to be in a â&#128;&#156;program budgetâ&#128;? format instead of an administrative budget. Up until then, the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s budget was presented and approved in administrative categories: staff will cost this&#13;
much; travel will cost this much and so on. And for the first time we were going to try and turn&#13;
it into a work program that would identify categories of work--appraisal and supervision and so&#13;
on--and their costs. The first thing we had to do, in fact, was to define the activities. What does&#13;
â&#128;&#156;lendingâ&#128;? mean? What is included in â&#128;&#156;sector workâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;economic workâ&#128;?? All these notions&#13;
really emerged during that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to defining the work categories, we had to somehow associate them with costs. You&#13;
remember those famous Timetables that had to be filled out showing how long it took to do&#13;
things. And then a whole process was introduced so staff could keep track of how their time was&#13;
spent. And Siem Aldewereld had those famous monthly Timetable meetings . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, that was for a different reason. What happened was that once the five-year program&#13;
had been set, everything worked beautifully. Borrowing worked; recruitment worked;&#13;
everything worked. The only thing that didnâ&#128;&#153;t work was the commitment levels didnâ&#128;&#153;t go up.&#13;
And when McNamara expressed his distress at this, and people would say, â&#128;&#156;Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s difficult,â&#128;?&#13;
he said, â&#128;&#156;But this is your plan.â&#128;? And this is where Aldewereld had to come to the rescue: the&#13;
timetables were introduced to check exactly where everything stood. But, of course, it was never&#13;
possible to control the outside world.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I have a somewhat different perspective. I think what McNamara did first of all&#13;
was to put pressure on the institution. He maintainedâ&#128;&#148;I think rightlyâ&#128;&#148;that deadlines make a&#13;
difference, that in fact people do respond to deadlines. Of course, there were some bad&#13;
consequences of this pressure which became so ingrained in the institution that we still have, I&#13;
think, a big problem as an inheritance of that.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing is that he would, as you say, frequently retort, â&#128;&#156;Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s your program. This is&#13;
what you fellows told me was the right thing to do, and I gave you the resources to do it.â&#128;? And&#13;
that eventually led to lots of contortions in two different directions. One was that we ended up&#13;
with a mechanism for discounting. This was the invention of a distinction between the Lending&#13;
Program, which is the bottom line level of expected commitments, and the Operations Program,&#13;
which is the aggregation of all the individual lending activities and therefore somewhat larger.&#13;
The work program was based on the Operations Program, on the assumption that there would be&#13;
some sort of discount or â&#128;&#156;slippage,â&#128;? to use the old phrase, between the total of all the individual&#13;
items and the bottom line. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we ever got that exactly right, but in any event, that was&#13;
the notion.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing about â&#128;&#156;your programâ&#128;? which I think is very interesting is that in McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
mind these Standard Tables embodied the entire plan, the entire purpose and structure of the&#13;
organization. His notion was that if you gave this information to any manager they would&#13;
clearly, on the one hand, be committed to the plan because they would have all the information,&#13;
and, secondly, they would understand what was going on. And so the Standard Tables after a&#13;
while were regularly distributed. Some were updated and circulated monthly, some quarterly,&#13;
some annually; a very few (for example those dealing with projected numbers of staff) were&#13;
prepared only for McNamara and not circulated further. Standard Tables were regularly&#13;
distributed to the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Council and to various senior managers at different levels. And&#13;
McNamara was always, I think, genuinely amazed that other people in the institution didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
regard these as their daily morning literature. He would say, in so many words, â&#128;&#156;I donâ&#128;&#153;t insist&#13;
that you look at this, but on the other hand if you want to know what Iâ&#128;&#153;m looking at, youâ&#128;&#153;d better&#13;
pay attention.â&#128;? And I would sometimes get calls from people like Peter Cargill, for example. He&#13;
would get the latest Standard Table and hadnâ&#128;&#153;t the remotest clue what it was about. In Peterâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
case, he also usually didnâ&#128;&#153;t care what it was about, but in the case of some other senior officials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they at least wanted to give the appearance of knowing what it was about, and they would want a&#13;
quick briefing on â&#128;&#156;Whatâ&#128;&#153;s in this, and is there anything here I should understand?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Basically, what I think McNamara failed to appreciate was the impact of his own style. The&#13;
reason the Standard Tables made sense to him was because heâ&#128;&#153;d designed them to the last detail.&#13;
He knew exactly what information they included, and it fitted into categories that were important&#13;
to him, that he had established. For the rest of the Bank, by and large it was important only&#13;
because you knew the boss was looking at it, but you really didnâ&#128;&#153;t use it as your own (or very&#13;
few used it as their own) material for planning and management. McNamara could never&#13;
understand that. He would always insist, â&#128;&#156;We only need one plan. We donâ&#128;&#153;t want different&#13;
people looking at different things here. We only want one sheet of music for the orchestra to&#13;
play from.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Having been a student of systems analysis, what did you think about McNamara's&#13;
planning/budgeting system?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I thought it was an elegant system in the sense that it hung together. It had&#13;
coherence and consistency. It met the expectations I would have had of a management&#13;
information system. Whether it represented the highest art of systems analysis, I rather doubt&#13;
because, frankly, systems analysis had more to do with the design of weapons and much more&#13;
sophisticated concepts than anything we were dealing with here. This was fundamentally&#13;
accounting. This was formulating a consistent set of data on plans rather than true systems&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, it was a rather impressive system, and it seemed to work. Here was an institution&#13;
which, as you point out, didn't commit quite as much as it said it was going to, but it sure as hell&#13;
grew at the rate it said it was going to grow, and it absorbed money at the rate it said it was going&#13;
to absorb money. It borrowed money at the rate it said it was going to borrow, and it stuck&#13;
reasonably well to its own plans during a period of very rapid growth. The ratio of administrative&#13;
costs to the total number of lending operations stayed reasonably constant, more than can be said&#13;
about any subsequent management regime. In a period of rapid growth, you do generally need a&#13;
much tighter control mechanism than when you are coasting along at growth rates of one or two&#13;
percent a year; those kinds of adjustments you could make without a tight management system.&#13;
&#13;
Now, of course, the obverse of that was there weren't many incentives to reduce costs within the&#13;
Bank. All the coefficients were rigorously worked out in advance so that everyone knew&#13;
instantly that if we increased lending in agriculture, for example, in a region by ten percent, then&#13;
staff would increase by, say, four percent, and administrative budgets would rise by three&#13;
percent. It was automatic. And I am afraid it resulted in a culture in which there were almost no&#13;
incentives for cost reduction.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did McNamara realize that?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether he realized it. I never heard him talk about it. Letâ&#128;&#153;s be clear:&#13;
he was no pushover when it came to budget increases. He would rarely give the resources that&#13;
Departments requested and justified. But on the other hand, there always had to be a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
rationalization for any change. There was never a gut feeling, â&#128;&#156;Oh, those guys have got too&#13;
much. They ought to be able to stop doing something and start something else.â&#128;? It always had&#13;
to be turned into an argument about the precise costs of doing this and how much you would&#13;
save by not doing that. Compared and calculated--it was always a calculus, not a gut feeling.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How long would you say it took for this culture to take hold? How long was it before people&#13;
really started to try to manipulate things within the system to try and get outcomes that they&#13;
wanted?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: It's an interesting question. People in the World Bank are pretty smart. It doesn't&#13;
take them long to figure out how to work the system. I would say that when McNamara arrived&#13;
there was a fairly slow moving pipeline. In his first year, McNamara drew down that pipeline,&#13;
pulling stuff out by encouragement and by saying, â&#128;&#156;Let's get things going, fellows.â&#128;? Whether that&#13;
was a lucky break or deliberate calculation, I'm not sure, but the result was that during that first&#13;
year there was a lot of additional lending, not because a great deal of additional resources were&#13;
spent but simply because McNamara was pushing stuff out. Now, in a sense, that made for a&#13;
leaner base on which to build, and I don't think there was an awful lot of waste because to get&#13;
that additional work out you had to have more people doing more things.&#13;
&#13;
It got a bit perverse, however, by the mid '70s. By this time, people had gotten used to&#13;
McNamara's systems. All of these systems had become bureaucratized. The institution had&#13;
become much larger, and people had figured out ways of working their way around the system.&#13;
So I suppose it became less effective in five or six years.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can you talk a little bit about McNamara? What kind of a person was he? Was it difficult to&#13;
deal with him? Was it difficult to get into his office?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I suppose I was always rather awed by McNamara, and perhaps I still am. I&#13;
admired him greatly. It was exciting to work with him. In a one-to-one relationship, or even in a&#13;
small discussion with him, you really could have a debate and get a sense that you were in on the&#13;
creation of something. Of course, when he was in a larger meeting (like the President's Council,&#13;
but more especially the Board), I saw a very different McNamara. In that environment, he was&#13;
very controlling. He wanted to be absolutely clear on the outcome. He didn't want any surprises,&#13;
and he wanted to ensure that what was said was what he wanted to say not what anybody else&#13;
wanted to say.&#13;
&#13;
This was often a subject of discussion within the P&amp;B group. We saw him, as it were, on the&#13;
intimate side, although â&#128;&#156;intimateâ&#128;? is to overstate it. I never heard McNamara crack a joke, for&#13;
example. Occasionally he would smile at something, but I never--and people Iâ&#128;&#153;ve worked with&#13;
never--had a relationship with him which was bantering, if you like. But on the other hand it was&#13;
reasonably open and easy, and it was intellectually stimulating. And we used to regret greatly&#13;
that somehow that image couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be conveyed to the rest of the Bank, because we knew very&#13;
well that there were lots of people in the Bank who were angry and resistant and regarded him as&#13;
a cold-blooded, computer-minded person, and all the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
John Adler, on more than one occasion, sent notes to McNamara saying that he thought it would&#13;
be an excellent idea if he could address the staff as a large group, either because there was some&#13;
policy question or following an annual meeting speech or something like that. McNamara&#13;
absolutely refused to do that. He would say things like, â&#128;&#156;Oh, no, they wouldn't want to hear me,â&#128;?&#13;
or â&#128;&#156;Well, if I were talking to them, there would be 500 of them or 800 of them and that would be&#13;
a tremendous waste of time, to have 800 people who were all in one room and only one of them&#13;
talking.â&#128;? These were his rationalizations, but he clearly was shy and simply unwilling to engage&#13;
in large-scale forums. My sense is that he was a very private person, and fundamentally&#13;
uncomfortable with people.&#13;
&#13;
I remember that when I was working in P&amp;B (it was 1970, actually) I got married. And I&#13;
received a telegram saying, â&#128;&#156;Congratulations on your marriage. Signed, Robert McNamara.â&#128;?&#13;
And I thought, â&#128;&#156;This must be a joke.â&#128;? I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t believe it; at first I thought one of my&#13;
colleagues in the office had done this.&#13;
&#13;
And I talked eventually to Peg Stroud, his secretary, and asked if it actually came from him.&#13;
And she said, â&#128;&#156;Yes. I told him that he should just call you up and tell you that, but he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t.&#13;
He wanted to send a telegram.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And somehow thatâ&#128;&#153;s characteristic. I mean, here was somebody that he knew wellâ&#128;&#148;I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
claim to have been a confidant, but he knew me well, and this was the way that he chose to deal&#13;
with the situation. He had this very formal streak, which I think made him appear a very formal,&#13;
forbidding figure to the rest of the staff of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you get any sense of his motivation to work and his personal relationship to the&#13;
objectives that he would proclaim?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Let me say one thing very clearly. I never had any sense that this was some sort of&#13;
penance. I think he is still, and certainly was, a very driven person. McNamara pushed himself&#13;
very hard, and he had very high ambitions and expectations of himself. He often said that this is&#13;
the most interesting job in the world, and, by the way, I think he's probably right. It is a&#13;
fascinating job, and I can well understand anybody wanting to do that. I suppose that's my bias.&#13;
However, I don't think he was trying to atone in some way for Vietnam. Now, it's true that he&#13;
had made a speech in Montreal, as I remember, as Secretary of Defense in . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: In 1966.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: 1966, where he talked about development as the â&#128;&#156;essence of security.â&#128;? So, I&#13;
suppose the notion must have been on his mind. I think that when he was trying to get out of the&#13;
Pentagon, this idea must have appealed to him, but I doubt whether he actively set out with the&#13;
idea that he would like to become a development guru. The opportunity just presented itself, and&#13;
he made the decision to take it: â&#128;&#156;Yes, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll do it, and by god, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll make something work there.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Q: But his speeches generally had a sort of moral tone to them, both in urging the rich countries&#13;
to be more generous and in decrying the terrible conditions of extreme poverty in the poor&#13;
countries. Did you get the sense that that was a sort of deep-founded personal commitment that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was reflected in this moral stance, or was that just one way of addressing the stinginess of&#13;
people?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure what the answer to that is. One thing that was very clear was that he&#13;
took very little advice from inside the Bank. Advice on his major commitments, speeches, the&#13;
themes that he was following, came mainly from people outside the Bank, people like Barbara&#13;
Ward, of course, whoâ&#128;&#153;s always cited in this context. And I think that some of the moral fervor&#13;
came from that source, which is not to say that he was merely mouthing other peopleâ&#128;&#153;s views.&#13;
He was very deliberately tapping into a larger group than the Bank and its traditions. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
have any doubt about the depth of his commitment. There was a certain ascetic side to him, from&#13;
my limited observation of his life. He used to wear these ratty tennis shoes on mission, and he&#13;
lived a relatively non-luxurious kind of existence in Washington (though he certainly lived in a&#13;
very nice house in Kalorama). He kept in good physical shape, partly by walking to work and up&#13;
the twelve flights of stairs to his office every morning. If I go back to the â&#128;&#156;missionaryâ&#128;? analogy&#13;
I used earlier, I think he would have made an excellent Jesuit; in fact, he could head the Order&#13;
very well . . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: How often did you see him usually?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: In the early period, probably once a day or every two days. Subsequently, it became&#13;
a more normal relationship of once a week. John Adler used to attend the President's Council&#13;
meetings, and I would stand in for him sometimes on those occasions, and probably there would&#13;
be one meeting a week of one sort or another where I would see him.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Once you became Deputy Director, did your relationship become more distant?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Well, yes, to a degree. That's when I would have stood in for John Adler in&#13;
meetings, for example, whereas earlier I would just have been seeing him on a more specific&#13;
basis. Later it was more as the Deputy of a Department which was doing a lot of work for the&#13;
boss, and in that context I would have been involved in a number of things John would normally&#13;
take care of.&#13;
&#13;
In those days there were the famous â&#128;&#156;green buttonâ&#128;? phones. This was a green colored phone that&#13;
McNamara had installed to replace the standard beige phone on the desk of selected senior staff&#13;
(mainly members of the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Council). The phone had, in addition to the normal buttons&#13;
that would connect you to your secretary or an outside line, et cetera, a special green button that&#13;
gave direct access to the phone on McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s desk. When the phones were first introduced in&#13;
May of 1968, the one that was installed in P&amp;B (at that time it was still PEC) was on John&#13;
Adlerâ&#128;&#153;s desk, not on John Williamsâ&#128;&#153; desk. That was part of the process which signaled John&#13;
Williamsâ&#128;&#153; demise in the P&amp;B context.&#13;
&#13;
But what I remember very distinctly is that in theory John Adler could pick up his phone, press&#13;
the green button, and have it ring on McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s desk and be in instant communication with the&#13;
boss. In reality what happened in that caseâ&#128;&#148;and, I suspect, in others as wellâ&#128;&#148;was that John&#13;
would call Peg Stroud, McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s secretary, and say, â&#128;&#156;Is this a good time to ring him?â&#128;? And if&#13;
there was a â&#128;&#156;go ahead,â&#128;? then he would pick up the phone and press the green button.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, the system worked the other way around. McNamara would pick up his phone&#13;
and press the Adler button, and the phone would ring and the green button would light up on&#13;
Johnâ&#128;&#153;s desk. John was always very anxious to be there if this ever happened. He would get very&#13;
upset if he had to leave the office when he thought the green button might ring.&#13;
&#13;
The funny part of this was that if McNamara rang, you pressed the green button, you talked to&#13;
McNamara, and you put the phone down. Now, if you forgot to release the green button and it&#13;
was still depressed, the next time you picked up the phone to talk to your secretary, the phone&#13;
rang on McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s desk. And this happened two or three times, driving John into an absolute&#13;
panic: he would think he was going to talk to his secretary and find McNamara on the other end&#13;
of the line. After a while he got so paranoid about this that he would have all sorts of reminders&#13;
stuck to his phone saying, â&#128;&#156;Press the other button.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
What all this illustrates is that a mechanism which Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure in McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s mind was a way of&#13;
ensuring close communication between himself and the top managers in the Bank actually&#13;
became, at least in my observation, a kind of an instrument of terror instead. They were&#13;
constantly worrying, â&#128;&#156;Oh, God! Is it going to ring? What should I do if it does? What if I can't&#13;
answer the questions?â&#128;? I'm sure there were some people like Peter Cargill who didn't give a&#13;
damn, but certainly some others thought it was really an instrument of control. If one wants to&#13;
characterize McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s management approach, then this point of control is really the key to it.&#13;
His intensely rational, control-oriented methods have been successful over the years in bringing&#13;
the institution's strength to bear on development problems. He got the institution to run circles&#13;
around him, tight and well-trained circles at that. At the President's Council meetings, he would&#13;
basically give his orders for the week.&#13;
&#13;
There were occasions obviously when people would have debates with him, but they certainly&#13;
weren't the regular meetings of the President's Council or any other formal meeting. I don't think&#13;
that McNamara was particularly interested in the opinions of most of the senior staff at the Bank.&#13;
He clearly paid attention to Hollis Chenery, Mahbub ul-Haq, Ernie [Ernest] Stern and various&#13;
other people, but he felt that the staff had certain limitations. He was not going to get rid of them&#13;
except in extreme cases. He was going to work with them and compensate as necessary for their&#13;
weaknesses. They were doing their jobs to the best of their abilities, and if he got anybody else,&#13;
they'd probably have other weaknesses. At least he knew the people he had.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was not particularly interested in building a management capability to run the&#13;
institution (because he was going to run it anyhow), nor was he interested in a succession process&#13;
because, what the hell, that was a long way off in the distance.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How long did you continue in this P&amp;B assignment?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: In 1974 I moved into the Latin America Projects Department under David Knox, as&#13;
an Assistant Director. I wanted at that point to get into Operations. P&amp;B was still exciting, but it&#13;
was a lot less exciting than it had been in the early days. The mechanisms were in place, the&#13;
systems were more or less running and so on, and after six years in P&amp;B I wanted to move.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did John Adler leave at the same time?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: No, what happened was that I was in the Latin America Region for a couple of&#13;
years, and then John Adler had a massive heart attack. Coincidentally, Adalbert Krieger had&#13;
recently been appointed Vice President of the Latin America Region (Gerry Alter having been&#13;
pushed aside), and Krieger decided that he wanted to get rid of me, for reasons that were never&#13;
made clear. I had enough credibility, because of my earlier reputation in P&amp;B, to have frank&#13;
discussions about this with both Burke Knapp (Senior Vice President) and Reg [Reginald A.]&#13;
Clarke (Director of Personnel); they rationalized the problem as simply a â&#128;&#156;clash of&#13;
personalities,â&#128;? and they urged me to move back to P&amp;B in my old role, to act for John Adler who&#13;
was likely to be incapacitated for an extended period, while his Deputy, Horst Schulman, was&#13;
about to leave the Bank to take up an important assignment with the German Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
&#13;
So with some reluctance I moved back, more or less temporarily, to P&amp;B. This must have been&#13;
in 1976. Not long after that, Georg Gabriel took over as Director, and when John Adler returned&#13;
to work he became a sort of senior advisor, much to his chagrin at the time. But I think after it&#13;
happened he was very pleased, because I donâ&#128;&#153;t think he enjoyed being a manager of a large&#13;
department. After Georg took over and things simmered down again, I moved on to East Asia,&#13;
again as an Assistant Director in the Projects Department. [Syed S.] Kirmani was Director of the&#13;
Department, and there was a â&#128;&#156;swapâ&#128;? arrangement with Heinz Vergin, who had been working for&#13;
Kirmani. Vergin moved into P&amp;B, and I moved out of P&amp;B into Kirmaniâ&#128;&#153;s East Asia Projects&#13;
Department.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That was in 1977, then.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Yes, 1977.&#13;
&#13;
I was in East Asia Projects until 1985. During that time we reorganized both Divisional and&#13;
Assistant Director portfolios to have a country rather than purely a sector focus, and I ended up&#13;
working mainly on the Philippines, Thailand and Laos.&#13;
&#13;
Then in 1986 I moved into Central Projects--it was called OPS [Operations Policy Staff], I think-&#13;
-to work in the Transport Department on something which subsequently became the Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa Transport Project. This was a UNDP [United Nations Development Program]-funded&#13;
initiative to do technical assistance work on transportation in Africa. It was handled by the&#13;
central Transport Department at the time because there were two separate Africa Vice&#13;
Presidencies, East Africa and West Africa, and so there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t any logical place to put it except&#13;
in the center. Then in 1987, at the time of the reorganization, one Africa Vice Presidency&#13;
emerged with its own technical department, and this was clearly a suitable function for them to&#13;
take on.&#13;
&#13;
I stayed on in what then emerged from the reorganization as the Infrastructure and Urban&#13;
Development Department, subsequently TWUâ&#128;&#148;Transport, Water and Urban--and I took on a&#13;
number of assignments for the Director and the front office. For example, I wrote the first policy&#13;
paper on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role in responding to natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the things I got involved in was another UNDP-funded and bilaterally-funded program&#13;
called the UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, which essentially provides&#13;
technical assistance to countries and NGOs [non-governmental organizations] in the whole area&#13;
of improving the access of poor people to water and sanitation: pit latrines and hand pumps, as&#13;
opposed to sewers and water treatment plants. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a fairly large program which spends about 15&#13;
million dollars a year, for which the Bank is the executing agency, in UNDP terms. I worked on&#13;
that for a time at headquarters, and then moved to Nairobi as the manager of the Regional team&#13;
based in Nairobi (one of four field-based regional teams). My move to Nairobi was in 1989. I&#13;
spent three years there, and then came back to headquarters in 1992, and since then Iâ&#128;&#153;ve actually&#13;
managed that same UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program at the global level at&#13;
headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And thatâ&#128;&#153;s what youâ&#128;&#153;re doing now?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what Iâ&#128;&#153;m doing now.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve by now become a sort of infrastructure expert: transport, water supply, and so on.&#13;
When you made that shift from P&amp;B into the Projects Department, was that difficult? I mean,&#13;
did you find that you had to sort of re-learn a lot of things?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Clearly I brought a different perspective from most of the other people who were&#13;
doing that sort of job. I remember that, for example, I was responsible for the agriculture&#13;
divisions in Latin America, and one of the things that I did was to introduce what subsequently&#13;
became the pattern in the Bank, re-organizing sector Divisions to have more of a country focus.&#13;
At that time we had separate divisions for irrigation, agricultural credit, agriculture crops, and&#13;
livestock. One of the things that I fairly quickly focused on was the need to have a division that&#13;
dealt with all agriculture in Brazil and a couple of other countries, and a division that dealt with&#13;
all agriculture in Mexico and so on, and split up the technical staff accordingly. Thinking back,&#13;
that must have been the first occasion when that trend started in the Bank. Of course, eventually&#13;
it went to the other extreme, as it is now in Southern Africa.&#13;
&#13;
So I suppose I brought somewhat different perspectives. But no doubt it was also a disadvantage&#13;
not to have come up through the project division, project division chief stream. My guess is that&#13;
I was as good as many other people in spotting the flaws in an appraisal or an economic and&#13;
sector report, but on the other hand certainly I was less familiar with the intricacies of what&#13;
makes an agricultural extension project work. I think itâ&#128;&#153;s true of all of us Young Professionals,&#13;
that we were, to a degree, generalists who acquired a professional veneer and a vocabulary and&#13;
even practical knowledge which at least allowed us to ask the right questions and to know where&#13;
to look for the right answers. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t feel at the time it was an enormous handicap, although&#13;
there were certainly times when I felt a bit out of my depth. Whether the other people who were&#13;
working for me thought it was a handicap, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you ever look back nostalgically and think, â&#128;&#156;Gee, I really should have stuck with&#13;
budgeting, programming and planningâ&#128;??&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           John Blaxall&#13;
                                    June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that. There have been two considerations influencing me. One was&#13;
that by the mid-1970s this whole construct of a programming and budgeting system was well in&#13;
place. Obviously, there were some interesting things happening, but it was a lot less exciting&#13;
than it had been in the early days when one was creating this enterprise. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to claim&#13;
that I created it but that I felt very much a part of the creation of something. That was very&#13;
exciting, and that moment had passed, any way you look at it.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing was my feeling that I didnâ&#128;&#153;t come to the World Bank to be a programming and&#13;
budgeting expert; I came to the World Bank because I was interested in development, and . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: . . I felt very much that I wanted to participate in that process. As always, things&#13;
happen; at particular moments there are particular jobs available; you do what comes along to&#13;
some extent. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t at this point regret the way this turned out at all. In fact, I feel Iâ&#128;&#153;ve had&#13;
the best of both worlds in many ways.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, to some extent I guess McNamara has been sort of a guru to you in the Bank.&#13;
Subsequent to your association with McNamara and P&amp;B and so on, did you have anything that&#13;
came close to this sort of guru experience with any of the people you worked for or with?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: You mean a mentor, that kind of relationship?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Well, John Adler was a man I was very fond of, certainly. And David Knox was&#13;
actually an impressive character to work for.&#13;
&#13;
But the other person that I enjoyed working with, and in a different way, was Kirmani, who was&#13;
my Director in East Asia Projects for seven or eight years. He was a very subtle, interesting man.&#13;
And the reason I think of Kirmani as being very interesting is because most people in the Bank,&#13;
wherever they come from, basically have a Western education and a Western cast of mind, at&#13;
least at the levels that one normally deals with them in the context of Bank work. Kirmani is one&#13;
of the few senior people in the Bank who really did not come up through that stream and tended&#13;
to look at things from a different perspective, which was always fascinating. There were&#13;
occasions when I could not understand at all what Kirmani was getting at, when I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get&#13;
him to make what I thought was a perfectly reasonable choice between two options, which I&#13;
found baffling. And yet when I sat down and thought through what heâ&#128;&#153;d said and what were the&#13;
various points heâ&#128;&#153;d made, out of that I could usually unravel a pretty sensible course of action.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s just that it was a very indirect message. And I learned to appreciate that. And there were&#13;
times when it was exasperating, no question, but I learned to appreciate that and to enjoy him as&#13;
a person. He would take a view that was typically rather different from the standard Bank view&#13;
on thingsâ&#128;&#148;not always right, in my judgmentâ&#128;&#148;but it was different and from that point of view&#13;
very valuable. And I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s perhaps something that one finds more of now in the Bank than&#13;
one did in the 1970s and 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            John Blaxall&#13;
                                     June 9, 1994 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Right. And I suppose it helped you tune into your clients that much better.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Absolutely, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, this has been fascinating and very interesting, but we are now running into the time&#13;
limits. Let me just raise one other question that we have been working on a bit, and we touched&#13;
on it very briefly, and this has to do with the reorganization in 1972. This reorganization in a&#13;
sense acknowledged developments which had been under way for quite some time. This whole&#13;
tension between the area and projects departments had been a problem when McNamara came on&#13;
board. This interfered with the five-year plan. Now, one of the things that has puzzled me is that&#13;
McNamara came in 1968 and he completed practically his whole first five-year term before he&#13;
actually moved to have this reorganization. Why do you think he waited that long? Was it that&#13;
he didnâ&#128;&#153;t know how to deal with this problem? Or was it that he didnâ&#128;&#153;t feel it was necessary to&#13;
deal with this problem?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that McNamara had a very positive view of reorganizations. In his&#13;
view, they impose very high costs, and any organization will work. It may work well or less&#13;
well, but reorganizations generally create a lot of difficulty and problems and they donâ&#128;&#153;t solve a&#13;
lot of problems. He was simply not enthusiastic about reorganizations in general. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a bit like&#13;
his attitude about the people around him: â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ll make do, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll make it work.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I suppose that by 1972 it simply came to the point where it was so necessary and so inevitable&#13;
that he had to do something. Incidentally, the magnitude of the Bank's operations had shifted&#13;
very dramatically. By 1973, the numbers of people in the projects staff must have tripled. So the&#13;
reorganization acknowledged that current arrangements were simply no longer viable.&#13;
&#13;
Q: If you look at later incumbents, [Barber B.] Conable, [Lewis T.] Preston, they practically walked into&#13;
the Bank and started reorganizing.&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: I think what you see there is the difference between McNamara and some of the&#13;
others: they had read management books, which say things like, â&#128;&#156;Whatever youâ&#128;&#153;re going to do&#13;
youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to do it the first year because after that . . .â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
I think McNamara would disagree with that. He would say, â&#128;&#156;Reorganizations arenâ&#128;&#153;t a good idea,&#13;
but when I decide one is necessary Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to bring to bear the necessary energy and resources&#13;
to do what has to be done.â&#128;? He was less beholden to the advice of the gurus because he had&#13;
already managed enormous organizations successfully and had no need for gurus.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You were not involved in the reorganization? I mean, in the planning and any of the&#13;
discussions?&#13;
&#13;
BLAXALL: Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure that P&amp;B must have been involved because in a sense we were involved&#13;
in everything, but to be perfectly honest I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember any particularly active involvement.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Okay. Thank you very much.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            John G. N. Blaxall held on June 9, 1994
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In June 1994, John G. N. Blaxall was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Jochen Kraske and David Milobsky. During
