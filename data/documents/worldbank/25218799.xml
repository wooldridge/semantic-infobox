&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
Rwanda has experienced a remarkable recovery since the civil war, with high growth&#13;
since the mid-1990s; gross domestic product (GDP) has grown 10 percent per year on&#13;
average. Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy, contributing a third of the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s GDP and about half of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s export earnings. Because about 80 Â­     percent&#13;
of the population lives in rural areas and is engaged in agriculture to some extent,&#13;
increasing agricultural productivity is key to improving incomes and decreasing pov-&#13;
erty. The government of Rwanda (GoR) has therefore made agricultural development&#13;
a priority and allocated significant resources to improving productivity, expanding&#13;
the livestock sector, promoting sustainable land management, and developing supply&#13;
chains and value-added activities. As a result, the sector grew an average 5 percent per&#13;
year over 2002â&#128;&#147;12, which is rather high although it fell short of both the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
own objective of 8â&#128;&#147;9 percent annual growth for the period (revised to 8.5 percent&#13;
for the next years in the new Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture in&#13;
Rwanda, PSTA III) and of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Pro-&#13;
gramme (CAADP) commitment of 6 percent growth in the agriculture sector.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector faces a series of challenges. Agricultural&#13;
land plots are very small (80Â percent of land holdings are less than 1 hectare [ha],&#13;
often divided into three to four plots), and over 70 percent of agricultural land is either&#13;
on hills or on the side of hills. Agriculture is dominated by small-scale, subsistence&#13;
farming under traditional agricultural practices and rain-fed agriculture. As a result,&#13;
average crop yields are low compared with potential yields, and crops are exposed to&#13;
risks such as weather-related shocks and pest and disease outbreaks. Current agricul-&#13;
tural policies are geared to increasing productivity in the sector by achieving scale in&#13;
agricultural production.&#13;
&#13;
Risks can potentially have significant implications on stakeholders, investments, and&#13;
development in the agriculture sector. Adverse movements in agricultural commod-&#13;
ity and input prices, together with production-related shocks (for example, from&#13;
weather, pests, and diseases), not only affect farmers and firms active in particular&#13;

private versus public goods, investment gaps, and market                is proposed for further assessment (table ES.3).&#13;
&#13;
Table ES.3. &amp;#7;Proposed Solutions Areas for Agricultural Risk Management in&#13;
            Rwanda&#13;
 1. Improve water management for crop production&#13;
 Water management in the crop sector, in particular to improve practices in preparation for dry periods and scattered rainfall, but&#13;
    also to better manage rainfall in the valleys to minimize flooding. Solutions areas may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Expansion of on-farm water-harvesting systems&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Viable mechanisms for financing small-scale irrigation&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Expansion and rehabilitation of drainage infrastructures in valleys&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Agricultural practices to improve soil moisture and reduce flooding, including minimum tillage agriculture&#13;
 2. Improve water and feed access in the livestock sector&#13;
 Weather-risk management in the livestock sector, particularly as it relates to water and feed access. Solutions may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Improving rural water infrastructure&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Developing existing feed supply chains to temporarily substitute for the lack of pastures in provinces where grazing is allowed&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Training of farmers in livestock management in water-scarce situations, and in good hygiene practices with special focus on&#13;
    practices in dry periods&#13;
 3. Strengthen pest and disease management in crop production&#13;
 Pest and disease management for crops, in particular as it relates to potential future risks caused by land consolidation and&#13;

    assessment. Solutions may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Improving agricultural practices and pest management, including further developing integrated pest management&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Strengthening the crop research system on pest and disease management and resilient crops&#13;

 4. Develop livestock disease management infrastructure&#13;
 Developing livestock disease management infrastructure to mitigate and manage disease outbreaks to decrease the economic&#13;
    impact on the sector. Solutions may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Developing livestock information systems, including animal registers and disease warning systems&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Developing veterinary services and vaccination programs&#13;

 5. Strengthen sanitary institutions and practices throughout the livestock supply chain&#13;
 Sanitary institutions and practices in the livestock sector, throughout the supply chain and involving both public and private actors.&#13;
    As incomes increase, this sector is likely to grow, so the necessary institutional infrastructure must be in place to mitigate risks&#13;
    and minimize losses. Solutions may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Strengthening animal disease management in relevant institutions&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Introducing farm-level livestock management&#13;

 6. Support improved price risk management in the export crop sector&#13;
 Assessing possible price management mechanisms for actors in the export crop supply chain. Given the exposure to international&#13;
     prices for actors in the coffee and tea supply chains, scope exists to strengthen price management mechanisms in the sector. By&#13;
     analyzing the physical and financial flows on current transaction arrangements for exports, a set of options on how to reduce&#13;
     exposure to risk can be identified. Potential solutions areas may include:&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Strengthening existing price information systems that allow for transparent price setting throughout the supply chain, and&#13;
    training actors throughout the chain to optimize given available information&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Providing price risk management training to actors in the supply chain, for example in forwarding Price To Be Fixed (PTBF)&#13;
    contracting&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Assessing available policy mechanisms for supporting actors in the sector against price risks&#13;
 â&#128;¢â&#128;&#130; Assessing possible production and marketing investments for producers and processors that can lessen relevant actorsâ&#128;&#153; exposure&#13;
    to risk&#13;
 7. Address milk price volatility&#13;
 Analyze milk price volatility to better understand the reasons behind the fluctuations in milk prices. This would include proposing&#13;
   appropriate price risk management mechanisms depending on the identified causes behind existing price volatilities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER ONE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Rwanda is a small, landlocked, agriculture-based country of 26,338 km2. With&#13;
12 million inhabitants, Rwanda is one of the 10 most densely populated countries in&#13;
the world (MINAGRI 2010). Although Rwanda has made remarkable progress over&#13;
the past two decades and is well under way to achieve its objective of becoming a&#13;
middle-income country by 2020, 45 percent of the population still lives in poverty,&#13;
mainly in the rural areas.2&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy, contributing a third of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP) and about half of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s export earnings. Because&#13;
about 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas and is engaged in agricul-&#13;
ture to some extent, increasing agricultural productivity is key to improving incomes&#13;
and decreasing poverty. The government of Rwanda has therefore made agricultural&#13;
development a priority and allocated significant resources to improving productivity,&#13;
expanding the livestock sector, promoting sustainable land management, and develop-&#13;
ing supply chains and value-added activities. As a result, the sector grew an average 5&#13;
percent per year over 2002â&#128;&#147;12, which is rather high although it fell short of both the&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s own objective of 8â&#128;&#147;9 percent annual growth for the period (revised to&#13;
8.5 percent for the next years in the new, PSTA III) and of the CAADP commitment&#13;
of 6 percent growth in the agriculture sector.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector faces a series of challenges. Agricultural&#13;
land plots are very small (80Â percent of land holdings are less than 1 ha, often divided&#13;
into three to four plots) and over 70 percent of agricultural land is either on hills or on&#13;
the side of hills. Agriculture is dominated by small-scale, subsistence farming under&#13;
traditional agricultural practices and rain-fed agriculture. As a result, average crop&#13;
yields are low compared with potential yields, and exposed to risks such as weather-&#13;
related shocks and pest and disease outbreaks.&#13;

&amp;#12;Poor groups are especially vulnerable to the impacts of           largest commodities that jointly account for 80 percent&#13;
risks, because risks tend to reinforce poverty traps through         Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural production value. The selected&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER TWO&#13;
AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
&#13;
Rwanda in the 21st Century&#13;
Emerging from the 1994 civil war, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy has seen a rapid expansion over&#13;
the past two decades. Overall growth has averaged 8 percent, exceeding average SSA&#13;
growth rates, and Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s total GDP now amounts to US$7.1 billion (2012 figure).&#13;
Inflation is relatively low and the government has maintained general macroeconomic&#13;
stability. In the World Bank/IFC Doing Business 2010 report, Rwanda was the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
top reformer and now ranks 32 out of 189 countries worldwide in the â&#128;&#156;ease of doing&#13;
businessâ&#128;&#157; (World Bank 2009). The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s vision is for Rwanda to become a&#13;
middle-income country with an annual per capita GDP of US$900 by 2020. This will&#13;
require annual growth of at least 7 percent.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, Rwanda is still relatively poor, ranking 36 out of 48 SSA countries in&#13;
2012 in terms of per capita GDP.3 Real per capita GDP was US$390 in 2012, com-&#13;
pared with the SSA average per capita GDP of US$1,522.4 As shown in figure 2.1,&#13;
large annual fluctuations in GDP growth rates have occurred over time.&#13;
&#13;
With low per capita GDP, poverty persists in Rwanda. About 63 percent of the popu-&#13;
lation lives on less than US$1.25 per day and 82 percent on less than US$2 per day.&#13;
Inequality is high: the Gini coefficient is 50.8 percent and 43Â percent of the income&#13;
share is held by 10 percent of the population.5,6&#13;
&#13;
The composition of GDP is 2013 was 33 percent agriculture, 14 percent industry, and&#13;
53 percent services (figureÂ 2.2). Over time, the share of agriculture has declined and&#13;
the share of services has increased. Rwanda is a relatively open economy and trade&#13;
constitutes almost half of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP. The value of imports is close to twice the&#13;
size of exports and account for 33Â percent of GDP, compared with 13Â  percent for&#13;
exports.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER THREE&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS&#13;
The identification, analysis, and prioritization of agricultural risks cover three separate&#13;
categories of agricultural commodities grown in Rwanda: (1) food crops, (2) export&#13;
crops, and (3) livestock. As discussed in chapter 1, the assessment looks at the largest&#13;
commodities that jointly account for 80 percent of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural production&#13;
value as well as the two largest agricultural export commodities. The selected com-&#13;
modities are:&#13;
&#13;
   Food crops: cassava, maize, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, plantains, beans, and&#13;
      rice&#13;
   Export/cash crops: tea and coffee&#13;
   Livestock: cattleâ&#128;&#148;meat and dairy&#13;
&#13;
This chapter looks at production risks, market risks, and enabling environment risks&#13;
for the commodities in these three categories.&#13;
&#13;
Food Crops&#13;
Food crops for domestic consumption dominate primary agriculture and are therefore&#13;
the main focus of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s Crop Intensification Program. Cassava, Irish potatoes,&#13;
sweet potatoes, maize, and bananas are the largest commodities in terms of produc-&#13;
tion value and account for 56 percent of total production value (2009â&#128;&#147;11 average).&#13;
Bean production accounts for just over 5 percent of total production but is important&#13;
because of its wide application across Rwanda, as 92 percent of rural households&#13;
cultivate various varieties of beans (NISR 2012a). Beans are also an important source&#13;
of protein.&#13;
&#13;
Largely a result of targeted agricultural policies and expansion of production areas,&#13;
maize, cassava, potato, and plantain production increased rapidly in the early to mid-&#13;
2000s. As explained earlier (box 2.1), the CIP supports maize, cassava, rice, Irish potato,&#13;
bean, and wheat producers with improved inputs; finances research for improved seeds&#13;
for these crops; and encourages production on consolidated land through cooperative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER FOUR&#13;
ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL RISK&#13;
The existence of agricultural risk has negative consequences for the productivity and&#13;
production of agricultural commodities as well as the level of profits and investments&#13;
in agribusiness for various supply chains. This can be measured in the form of losses&#13;
resulting from the prevalence of various agricultural risks. The purpose of this chapter&#13;
is to quantify the production losses for individual food and export crops in different&#13;
provinces of the country, as well as the aggregate losses. This is important to under-&#13;
stand how frequently risks occur, the volume and monetary value lost in each risk event&#13;
or for each crop, and the geographic distribution of these losses. Ultimately, this will&#13;
help in identifying and targeting risk management interventions in a way that has the&#13;
greatest ability to minimize risk-related losses.&#13;
&#13;
The Methodology Used to Estimate&#13;
Production Losses&#13;
Losses that occur because of agricultural risks refer primarily to production losses&#13;
caused by weather-related events such as droughts, floods, erratic rains, landslides,&#13;
hailstorms, and diseases and/or pest outbreaks. The following method was applied to&#13;
calculate production losses in a particular year: (1) a historical linear trend line for the&#13;
yield of each crop was constructed; (2) a second linear trend line was drawn, represent-&#13;
ing one-third of the standard deviation of the crop yields; (3) loss years were identified&#13;
as those in which actual yields were lower than the linear trend line; (4) production&#13;
losses were calculated using the difference between the predicted value (the original&#13;
trend line) and actual yield; and (5) losses were totaled and divided by the total number&#13;
of years examined to determine the average annual loss rate for a particular crop; (6)&#13;
the annual quantity lost was converted into value terms by using the producer price&#13;
for each crop; and (7) because producer prices are in local currency, the value was con-&#13;
verted to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate. Figure 4.1 shows the outcome&#13;
of steps (1)â&#128;&#147;(5) for a hypothetical crop.&#13;
&#13;
Information about the production loss for a particular crop and in a particular year&#13;
can also be used to (1) calculate the loss as a share of agricultural GDP for that crop&#13;
in a particular year; (2) add production losses for different crops to estimate aggregate&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER FIVE&#13;
RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A variety of risks exist across Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector. Previous chapters described&#13;
the major risks affecting Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector and specific commodity groups&#13;
(food crops, export crops, and livestock), attempted to quantify losses associated with&#13;
these major risks, and assessed their impacts on actors in the agriculture sector. Special&#13;
attention was given to impacts on Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s most vulnerable groups and how those&#13;
impacts affect men and women differently.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis undertaken during the risk assessment allows for prioritization of risks&#13;
in relation to the probability of events and their degree of impact, followed by the&#13;
relevant measures to manage these risks. In Rwanda, many programs and activities&#13;
funded by government and donors are already in place to make the agriculture sector&#13;
more resilient. Furthermore, businesses, individual farmers, and consumers may adopt&#13;
other measures, such as managing higher prices and limited availability of certain&#13;
commodities by substituting for others. This leads to questions about the effectiveness&#13;
of existing activities and the sufficiency of their coverage. Options for better man-&#13;
agement, taking into account the capacity to implement and fund them in Rwanda,&#13;
should also be considered.&#13;
&#13;
This chapter prioritizes existing risks and provides recommendations for how Rwanda&#13;
can more effectively manage risks, based on a consultative stakeholder exercise. It&#13;
identifies priority areas for risk management interventions that will be explored in&#13;
depth in the Phase II Solutions Assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Prioritization&#13;
Identifying and prioritizing risks is an important first step in designing a set of compre-&#13;
hensive and effective measures to manage risks. With scarce budgetary resources, it is&#13;
crucial that some sort of prioritization takes place to understand the key risks in terms&#13;
of frequency of occurrence and degree of impact. Given the data constraints, it is&#13;
important to note that this list is not exhaustive and the ranking of risks is based on the&#13;
World Bank teamâ&#128;&#153;s evaluation from both data analysis and on-the-ground research.&#13;
The differing significance of these risks to different stakeholders in society can be&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Appendix A&#13;
Stakeholder Feedback&#13;
&#13;
Decision Filters&#13;
Rwanda, like most countries, is resource constrained and so decision makers are com-&#13;
pelled to find the quickest, cheapest, and most effective measures among the options&#13;
presented. A detailed cost-benefit analysis can help in selecting the most appropriate&#13;
intervention; however, this exercise itself would be costly and time consuming. Fur-&#13;
thermore, many elements in making these decisions are not easily quantifiable and&#13;
not easy to factor in. Using decision filters to evaluate and prioritize the list could aid&#13;
in making rational resource allocation decisions in place of a detailed cost-benefit&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
The following criteria were presented by the World Bank team for this purpose.&#13;
A number of complex analytic screening tools are available to assess the various differ-&#13;
ent filters and this report does not claim methodological rigor in assessing the filters.&#13;
These filters were applied to provide a rapid assessment to obtain some form of priori-&#13;
tization based on feedback from key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
   Applicability: Whether a government department or a private sector firm,&#13;
   there are current policy/programming or business objectives. In an aim to make&#13;
   the interventions enter seamlessly into existing practices/plans, it is important&#13;
   that the applicability of specific interventions is taken into account.&#13;
   Feasibility: Whether it would be/is easy for a government/firm to imple-&#13;
   ment this intervention in the short/medium term is an important factor to take&#13;
   into consideration; often â&#128;&#156;quick-winsâ&#128;&#157; will come across as more attractive and&#13;
   Â­implementable.&#13;
   Affordability: One of the most important considerations for anyone getting&#13;
   involved in implementing an intervention is whether or not that intervention is&#13;
   affordable with regard to current and future budgets.&#13;
   Scalability: Whereas an intervention may have positive results in a small pilot,&#13;
   it is important for actors to take into consideration whether or not they will be&#13;
   able to roll out the intervention to a wider group of affected people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment                                                           59&#13;
&amp;#12; Sustainability: Whereas some interventions, such                                                  For Rwanda, three matrixes were drawn up, one each for&#13;
 as coping mechanisms, quickly provide resources                                                   food crops, export crops, and livestock (figures A.1â&#128;&#147;A.3).&#13;
 for affected people, for larger and more expensive                                                The results after the application of these decision filters are&#13;
 interventions it is important to think about how sus-                                             shown next, but it should be remembered that they are indic-&#13;
 tainable the intervention will be in the long run or                                              ative and imperfect. However, they do provide a first step&#13;
 once government funding runs out or resources are                                                 toward development of a more comprehensive and strategic&#13;
 directed elsewhere.                                                                               approach for managing risks in Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector.&#13;

Climate Change in Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
Current Conditions&#13;
Situated on mountainous terrain in the East African Rift Valley, Rwanda has a tropi-&#13;
cal temperate climate (REMA 2009, 97). The hilly terrain produces a diverse range&#13;
of agro-ecological conditions in the country, allowing for a wide variety of crops to be&#13;
grown but also adding to climate forecasting challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Temperatures in the country vary with altitude, but average annual temperatures&#13;
hover between 16Â°C and 20Â°C (REMA 2009, 97.).&#13;
&#13;
Rainfall in the country is also shaped by multiple factors. On average, the country&#13;
receives 1,250 mm of rainfall annually (Stockholm Environment Institute 2009, 4).&#13;
Primary influence of rainfall patterns falls on the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone&#13;
where the weather systems of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meet. The&#13;
progression of the ITCZ results in two types of seasons: dry and rainy.&#13;
&#13;
El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a, opposite phases of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation36 (ENSO),&#13;
also affect Rwanda, creating heavy rainfall and severe dry conditions, respectively,&#13;
when they occur every three to five years (Smith School of Enterprise and the Envi-&#13;
ronment 2011a, 4). Furthermore, the Congo air mass, a moist air appendage of the&#13;
ITCZ, as well as the Mascarene, Azores, St. Helena, and Arabian high-pressure sys-&#13;
tems, and subtropical anticyclones also influence rainfall (Smith School of Enterprise&#13;
and the Environment 2011a, 4).&#13;
&#13;
Four seasons divide a calendar year in Rwanda: two rainy seasons, from September to&#13;
November and from March to May (figure B.1); and two dry seasons, from December&#13;
to February and June to August.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  The El Ninoâ&#128;&#147;Southern Oscillation makes up the cyclical temperature fluctuations between the ocean and atmo-&#13;
sphere in the East-Central Equatorial Pacific, which occur every 3â&#128;&#147;5 years. For more information, see NOAA, http://&#13;

Vulnerability Assessment&#13;
Over the past decade, Rwanda has made significant progress in reducing poverty, from&#13;
57 percent in 2005/06 to 45 percent in 2010/11. Extreme poverty decreased from&#13;
36Â  percent to 24 percent in the same period. The increase in agricultural productiv-&#13;
ity is partly attributable to this achievement. Nevertheless, many groups remain vul-&#13;
nerable, not the least in rural areas, where 49 percent of the population lives below&#13;
the poverty line compared with 22 percent in urban areas. Overall, 40 percent of&#13;
households in Rwanda can be classified as â&#128;&#156;low-incomeâ&#128;&#157; agriculturalists; 14 percent&#13;
of households rely on both agriculture and unskilled daily labor; and 13 percent rely&#13;
solely on agriculture. Further, poverty is higher in female- and widow-headed house-&#13;
holds compared with the national average (see table C.1).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Appendix E&#13;
Food Crop Supply Chain Analysis&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The environment for staple crop production benefits from relatively consistent rainfall,&#13;
occurring in two clear seasons, Season A (November to January) and Season B (April&#13;
to June), although rainfall may also occur between these periods. Rainfall statistics&#13;
indicate that within the rainy seasons, few periods of severe drought have occurred&#13;
in the last 30 years, although seasonal variations may be as large as +/â&#136;&#146;15 percent,&#13;
occurring approximately every 10â&#128;&#147;15 years. At the same time, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s elevation at&#13;
1,500â&#128;&#147;4,500 meters above sea level promotes a cooler climate that permits the produc-&#13;
tion of a wider range of crops than elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. Potatoes in par-&#13;
ticular grow well under the cooler conditions prevailing at higher altitudes; conversely,&#13;
at lower altitudes crops such as bananas and rice grow well. Nevertheless, overall the&#13;
temperature range is generally below the harsher high temperatures that can curtail&#13;
crop growth.&#13;
&#13;
The moist conditions that prevail during the rainy seasons promote the spread of&#13;
fungal diseases, whereas the consistent temperatures favor the development of insect&#13;
pests. High levels of rainfall contribute to the leaching of soil nutrients and acidifica-&#13;
tion of the soil. Moreover, the steep slopes that dominate much of the country render&#13;
soils liable to erosion, especially once cultivated. Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s meteorological conditions&#13;
are thus a two-edged sword that favors the growth of crops and their pests and diseases&#13;
whereas also promoting soil degradation.&#13;
&#13;
Almost all staple crops (with the exception of rice) are grown by a large proportion of&#13;
smallholders, many of whom produce only on a subsistence basis. The average farm&#13;
size in 2006 was 0.72 ha. This is insufficient to provide sustainable food security and&#13;
in rural areas, agricultural income (including the value of home consumption) aver-&#13;
ages RF 120,697 (US$180) and represents only approximately 52 percent of aver-&#13;
age household income of RF 235,000 (US$350). Of this amount, home consumption&#13;
amounts to approximately 87 percent (NISR 2012b). Given the emphasis on subsis-&#13;
tence production, markets have developed based on the commercial surplus that is&#13;
sporadically generated and that can vary from season to season. In most cases, prices&#13;

surpluses and shortages can arise as a result of tradersâ&#128;&#153;         production is assessed in the following analyses of the six&#13;

&amp;#12;The production of rice in Rwanda is subject to two major        Pests and Disease&#13;
constraints: temperature and moisture. As a result, it is       Given that rice is grown in large areas across valley bot-&#13;
grown almost exclusively in the lower valley bottoms,           toms, the crop is vulnerable to the rapid spread of pests&#13;

            Rwanda - Agricultural sector risk assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Agriculture is the dominant sector of
            the economy, contributing a third of the country’s gross
            domestic product (GDP) and about half of Rwanda’s export
            earnings. The government of Rwanda has therefore made
            agricultural development a priority and allocated
            significant resources to improving productivity, expanding
            the livestock sector, promoting sustainable land management,
            and developing supply chains and value-added activities. At
            the same time, Rwanda’s agriculture sector faces a series of
            challenges. Agriculture is dominated by small-scale,
            subsistence farming under traditional agricultural practices
            and rain-fed agriculture. As a result, average crop yields
            are low compared with potential yields, and exposed to risks
            such as weather related shocks and pest and disease
            outbreaks. The purpose of this report is to assess existing
            risks to the agriculture sector, prioritize them according
            to their frequency and impacts on the sector, and identify
            areas of risk management solutions that need deeper
            specialized attention. Three levels of risks are assessed:
            production risks, market risks, and enabling environment
            risks to selected supply chains. The report takes a
            quantitative and qualitative approach to risks. The report
            is structured as follows: chapter one gives introduction.
            Chapter two provides an overview of Rwanda’s economy and the
            role and structure of the agriculture sector. Agriculture
            sector risks (production, market, and enabling environment
            risks) for the selected food crops, export crops, and
            livestock are analyzed in chapter three. Analysis of the
            adverse impacts of agricultural risks at aggregate and
            provincial levels, along with a stakeholder risk assessment
            and a discussion of particularly vulnerable groups, is
            presented in chapter four. Chapter five prioritizes
            identified risks, discusses potential solutions areas,
            summarizes feedback from consulted stakeholders, and
            recommends solutions areas for further assessment.
