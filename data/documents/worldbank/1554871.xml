Abstract&#13;
Most developing countries have highly centralized govern-&#13;
ments that naturally concentrate on their own role in development, in&#13;
isolation from local government. This paper argues that government&#13;
performance in the pursuit of development objectives is influenced by&#13;
all the levels of government--moreover, that effective public sector&#13;
management depends on the ability of the central government to harness&#13;
the resources of lower levels of government.&#13;
Local governments should be given elastic revenue sources,&#13;
that is, sources that grow as the economy grows and that are not beyond&#13;
their administrative capacity to collect. Personnel performance at the&#13;
local level has improved when one or more of the following elements were&#13;
present: (a) well planned horizontal or vertical integration of&#13;
personnel systems; (b) adequate compensation and incentives; (c) a&#13;
determined effort to make officials accountable for their performance;&#13;
(d) effective training of local officials.&#13;
The division of responsibilities between levels of government&#13;
needs to be carefully examined before a plan can be constructed for the&#13;
improvement of local government. Which level of government is best&#13;
suited to perform a particular function? Experience shows that some&#13;
degree of continuing centralization is necessary. Finally the paper&#13;
suggests that new institutional arrangements may be needed if local&#13;
government is to be strengthened. A major obstacle to such reform is&#13;
the absence of a holistic view of government that argues for integrating&#13;
the efforts of all levels of government.&#13;

Foreword&#13;
This study is one in a series of World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Papers devoted to issues of development management. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1983, they&#13;
provide an in-depth treatment of the subjects dealt with in Part&#13;
II of the Report. The thirteen papers cover topics ranging from&#13;
comprehensive surveys of management issues in different types of&#13;
public sector institutions (for example, state-owned enterprises,&#13;
the public service, and local government agencies) to broad&#13;
overviews of such subjects as planning, management training,&#13;
technical assistance, corruption, and decentralization0&#13;
The central concern underlying these papers is the search&#13;
for greater efficiency in setting and pursuing development&#13;
goals. The papers focus on the role of the state in this process,&#13;
stress the importance of appropriate incentives, and assess the&#13;
effectiveness of alternative institutional arrangements. They&#13;
offer no general prescriptions, as the developing countries are&#13;
too diverse--politically, culturally, and in economic resources--&#13;
to allow the definition of a single strategy.&#13;
The papers draw extensively on the experiences of the&#13;
World Bank and other international agencies. They were reviewed&#13;
by a wide range of readership from developing and developed&#13;
countries inside and outside the Bank. They were edited by&#13;
Victoria Macintyre. Rhoda Blade-Charest, Banjonglak Duangrat,&#13;
Jaunianne Fawkes, and Carlina Jones prepared the manuscripts for&#13;
publication.&#13;
I hope that these studies will be useful to practitioners&#13;
and academicians of development management around the world.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
Few developing countries have fully recognized the contribution that&#13;
local government can make in achieving national development goals. Instead,&#13;
government activities at the local level have, by and large, been considered&#13;
extrinsic to central concerns. One of the main reasons for this attitude, no&#13;
doubt, is that most developing countries have highly centralized governments&#13;
that naturally concentrate on their own role in development, in isolation from&#13;
local government. 1/ In the experience of industrialized countries, however,&#13;
economic growth has been accompanied by significant growth in the size,&#13;
efficiency, and effectiveness of local government relative to the center. The&#13;
share of state and local government in employment, for example, averages 11&#13;
percent in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation&#13;
and Development (countries with a large share are the United States, 14.3&#13;
percent; Australia, 19.5 percent; Denmark, 19.6 percent; Sweden, 25.1 percent;&#13;
and the United Kingdom, 12.6 percent). In the developing countries, by&#13;
contrast, the average share of employment in the modern sector of the economy&#13;
is only 4.5 percent (it ranges from 2.5 percent in Africa to 8.0 percent in&#13;
Asia). These figures suggest that local government may indeed have a role to&#13;
play in the management of development. Taking that idea a step further, this&#13;
paper argues that government performance in the pursuit of development&#13;
objectives is influenced by all levels of government--moreover, that effective&#13;
public sector management depends on the ability of the central government to&#13;
harness the resources of the lower levels of government. 2/&#13;
The first point that needs to be clarified in any discussion of this&#13;
topic is that the term "local government" does not denote a small segment of&#13;
government. In industrialized countries, and some developing countries, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
number of civil servants at the local level, in relation to the central&#13;
government, is much larger than is commonly believed. In the United StatesD&#13;
for examples there are four times as many local government employees as&#13;
federal employees; in India, local level employees represent 40 percent of&#13;
federal employees. 3/ Another source of confusion lies in the varying&#13;
definitions of local government in some countries. In this discussion, the&#13;
term is taken to mean levels of government that are subordinate to the central&#13;
governments but that do not include state governments in federal systems of&#13;
government.&#13;
Within that contexts it is useful to consider what recent experience&#13;
can tell us about the possible methods of strengthening local government and&#13;
the role of central government in this processo This paper focuses mainly on&#13;
rural local governments, since less work has been done there than on urban&#13;
issues, which have already been studied more extensively. Clearcut lessons&#13;
should not be expected, however, in view of the economicD cultural, and&#13;
political diversity present among Third World local governments. However, a&#13;
slight overemphasis on the traditions of local government drawn from the&#13;
United Kingdom may be detected--a bias that seems unavoidable because much of&#13;
the literature deals with countries affected by these traditions.&#13;
Nonetheless, the central discussion here of intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
relations, personnel managements and allocation of functions applies to most&#13;
developing countries, regardless of the source of their administrative&#13;
traditions (see Annex). Before that discussion can go forward, a few general&#13;
observations need to be made about the comparative advantages of local&#13;
government over central government in the development process, the problems&#13;
for local government in this area, and the basic steps that must be taken to&#13;
make local government an effective participant in development activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Comparative Advantages of Local Government&#13;
The idea that local government has underutilized development&#13;
potential has been voiced before now. When the socialists were returned to&#13;
power in Great Britain after World War II, for example, the Secretary of State&#13;
for the Colonies, Arthur Creech-Jones, sent a dispatch to African governors of&#13;
the colonies preparing for independence in which he noted:&#13;
1.   Local government has the potential to increase local&#13;
participation in the development process.&#13;
2.   Local government assistance is more efficient than&#13;
central government assistance, or could be made so.&#13;
3.   Local government is, or could be, democratic. 4/&#13;
These remarks lead one to ask what particular kinds of development activity&#13;
can or should be more efficiently discharged by local government. Among the&#13;
countries posing the same question, the Philippine government seems interested&#13;
in strengthening fiscal performance at the local level; 5/ Tanzania is giving&#13;
local government a role in promoting economic development; 6/ Peru is enacting&#13;
legislation to greatly increase autonomy at the local level; and Ghana's&#13;
experiments aimed at increasing tax yields at the local level have produced a&#13;
substantial improvement in revenue. 7/ Also relevant is the fact that almost&#13;
half of the Agency for International Development's public finance projects up&#13;
to 1979 were concentrated at the local level. 8/&#13;
In certain situations revenues are more easily generated by systems&#13;
with strong local governments than by those dominated by central&#13;
governments. This can be seen in the cases of Egypt and Yemen, both of which&#13;
rely heavily on the Zakat, a religious tax. In Egypt, where local government&#13;
is weak, collection is poor and 90 percent of local government revenues in&#13;
rural areas have to come from the central government, 9/ whereas in rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
areas of Yemen, where local government is strong , 80 percent of these revenues&#13;
are locally raised. 10/ In municipal areas of Thailand, too, collection is&#13;
not a problem where it is delegated to community level organizations.&#13;
Wherever a central government intervenes to upgrade management capacity at&#13;
the local level, however, the result may be even more beneficial than it is&#13;
when a local or central government attempts to act alone. Following up on the&#13;
idea of such a partnership to promote economic development, the World Bank&#13;
undertook the Hill Farming Technical Development Project in Azad Kashmed,&#13;
Pakistan, in 1978, which was designed to improve forestry practices at the&#13;
local level by having local people and their local government work closely&#13;
with the central government. To meet the needs of 300,000 families in the&#13;
area, the project had to produce 800,000 tons of firewood annually. At 200&#13;
rupees an acre, however, the Rs. 600 million required for the entire project&#13;
was beyond the resources of the central government. Village authorities were&#13;
therefore used to mobilize the people for new plantings. Thus the central&#13;
government's investment costs were reduced and social pressure was organized&#13;
to protect the government lots. An added advantage was that women were&#13;
encouraged to participate in the projecto By 1981 it was well on the way to&#13;
achieving its target of 130,000 hectares of new planting. 11/&#13;
A similar program in Kenya--the Special Rural Development Program--&#13;
succeeded in the Machakos district because local people were involved in the&#13;
planning and implementation of development activities0 In Turkana, by&#13;
contrast, such programs have foundered because local people were not able to&#13;
participate in them. As the World Development Report 1980 has noted, "When&#13;
beneficiaries are involved through their own organizations, they respond more&#13;
effectively to services." Of course, this does not mean that local&#13;
governments are automatically capable of handling development taskso Indeed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
many would be incapable of doing so. Perhaps a more fundamental problem in&#13;
harnessing the potential at this level lies in the general attitude about the&#13;
proper function of local governments. The recent debate over the "new&#13;
federalism" in the United States is thus a timely one because the central&#13;
issue--the role of different levels of government in stimulating economic&#13;
development--is precisely the question that developing countries should&#13;
tackle. 12/&#13;
Problem Areas&#13;
Specific problems of the type experienced in French West Africa,&#13;
where only 22 percent of potential revenues were collected by local&#13;
government, 13/ appear to be sypmtomatic of larger problems--that is, many&#13;
local governments in developing countries are fragmented, confused about their&#13;
functions, and all too often either invisible or largely ceremonial. 14/&#13;
Considerable effort would therefore be required to strengthen their&#13;
capabilities. Despite the interest expressed in that idea during the early&#13;
1970s, however, most planners have failed to see that a strengthening of local&#13;
government would help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of economic&#13;
management. Not one of the fifty-four development plans examined by the&#13;
International Union of Local Authorities in the Hague in 1981, for example,&#13;
explicitly considered the role of local government in the promotion of&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
Some might argue that local government is not included in national&#13;
development plans because politicians of the center do not wish to share their&#13;
power or may even be anxious to avoid empowering entrenched local elites.&#13;
Interestingly, the most authoritarian military regimes that have guarded power&#13;
jealously (for example, in Nigeria and Pakistan) have also promoted local&#13;
government reform. Most politicians are aware that centralization frustrates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the distribution of benefits to the rural massesD and a good number of them&#13;
consider it politically expedient to strengthen local government and thereby&#13;
reduce the inability (and possibly culpability) of the center to meet rural&#13;
needs. Consequently, decentralization has been promoted by politicians in&#13;
many countries. The reluctance of politicians in central government to share&#13;
power with local authorities, as this paper argues, is not the real problem--&#13;
on the contrary, one of the greatest threats to the successful reform of local&#13;
governments in developing countries is the politically motivated and, too&#13;
often, poorly planned decentralization exercises that fail to provide&#13;
sufficient resources to enable local governments to meet local needs and&#13;
fulfill their aspirations.&#13;
Wherever central government ignores the opportunity to work with and&#13;
through local authorities, the chances of achieving widespread popular&#13;
participation in development efforts become weakened and mistrust may even&#13;
develop, as is evident in the reaction of Peruvian campesinos to central&#13;
government development initiatives: "Be suspicious. Say what they want.&#13;
Drag your feet, keep doing what you have always done." 15/ The Mills-Odoi&#13;
Commission on the use of manpower in Ghana also made the point that, from the&#13;
perspective of the efficiency and effectiveness of all government activity,&#13;
the establishment of staffing patterns that encourage concentration of high-&#13;
level personnel in central government has adverse effects on the management of&#13;
public services at the local government level. 16/&#13;
Much of the literature on local government has little to say about&#13;
the development role of local authorities in the achievement of national&#13;
objectives or about the prospects for expanding that role0 Moreover, many of&#13;
the standard works are ten to fifteen years old and are strongly biased toward&#13;
urban areas and developed countries. 17/ Surprisingly little attention has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
been paid to important issues such as the number of people employed in local&#13;
government or local government contributions to economic growth. 18/ The&#13;
literature provides details of the problems local government must resolve, but&#13;
has too little to say about how to improve matters. Although a few case&#13;
studies have produced rich insights, most of the situations selected for&#13;
examination are atypical, and agreement has not yet been reached on a&#13;
satisfactory method of comparison. Nevertheless, some useful public finance&#13;
work has been done on state and local finances (the results suggest that, if&#13;
local authorities do not enjoy a substantial degree of financial autonomy,&#13;
their existence is threatened). 19/ A few studies that have examined the&#13;
political aspects of local government, urban politics, and questions of&#13;
community power have also underlined the point that local governments vary so&#13;
greatly that it is impossible to come up with general solutions. 20/ All in&#13;
all, local government, since it occupies a position between community and&#13;
nation, does not readily lend itself to either microstudies or to&#13;
macrostudies.&#13;
What heeds to be Done&#13;
To promote greater efficiency and effectiveness in public sector&#13;
management, central governments really need to review the development&#13;
functions that local governments now perform as well as the kinds of functions&#13;
they could undertake in the future and the resources needed to fulfill these&#13;
functions. Traditionally, local government has had a regulatory and&#13;
extractive role and has had little to do with economic development. That type&#13;
of unbalanced allocation of functions between levels of government leads to an&#13;
unbalanced public service at the local level and gives local governments no&#13;
basis on which to stimulate economic growth. Since health and education&#13;
functions are usually carried out at the local level, local officials are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
available to provide a useful input to the national planning processo This is&#13;
usually not the case for agricultural or industrial development, however,&#13;
because local authorities have inadequate funds and staff in these areas.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, many argue that decentralization is an&#13;
effective way to strengthen local government, 21/ but in some countries (for&#13;
example, Papua New Guinea and Tanzania) initial attempts at decentralization&#13;
have actually weakened local governmento This paper argues that cooperation&#13;
between central and local government is certainly a key ingredient of&#13;
successful development1, but that it must be focused on long-range (five- to&#13;
ten-year) plans for improvement and on definite targets for generating&#13;
revenues, managing personnel, and assigning functional responsibilities. This&#13;
means that improvement plans should be comprehensive, but their implementation&#13;
should be incremental.&#13;
II. Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations&#13;
Revenues from forest products, minerals, trade, fishing, indirect&#13;
taxation, customs tariffs, and most direct taxation of high income, as well as&#13;
proceeds from international development assistance, all usually accrue to&#13;
central governmento Local government obtains most of its revenue from limited&#13;
sources: property taxes, licenses (firearms, radios, stores, and so on)5,&#13;
rental of facilities such as markets or abbatoirs, and flat rate taxes levied&#13;
on all able-bodied males. Furthermore, the amounts are usually very small,&#13;
the administrative costs of tracking down those who are liable are heavy, and&#13;
the incidence of nonpayment is usually very high. Government at the center&#13;
usually takes the taxes that are easy to collect1, leaving local government&#13;
eith revenue sources that are politically and administratively difficult to&#13;
gather0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The problem for local governments, then, is that they have little&#13;
chance of raising sufficient revenues to meet current needs or to expand their&#13;
responsibilities. In such circumstance, residents become accustomed to and&#13;
expect minimum levels of health, education, and so on, for once these&#13;
unavoidable expenses have been taken care of, local government spending&#13;
capacity is exhausted. Local governments should therefore be given elastic&#13;
revenue sources, that is, sources that grow as the economy grows, and that are&#13;
not beyond their administrative capacity to collect. The question of&#13;
administrative capacity raises another important point: the assessment and&#13;
collection of local revenues depends primarily on the quality and quantity of&#13;
manpower available to local authorities. Without adequate financial&#13;
resources, local governments are unable to attract professionally qualified&#13;
people, particularly accountants, assessors, and surveyors. Without such&#13;
people, it is, of course, difficult to perform financial activities; it seems&#13;
reasonable to conclude that upgrading administrative performance would more&#13;
than pay for itself.&#13;
In some cases, reform aimed at increasing local revenues has begun by&#13;
strengthening performance at the center. Brazil's reforms of 1965-67, for&#13;
example, were intended to strengthen the financial capacity of lower levels of&#13;
government while reducing disparities within and between regions. States and&#13;
municipalities were to share in an elastic tax base that was created by&#13;
enhancing the central government's power to raise and allocate taxes at the&#13;
same time that some traditional sources of revenue were removed from states&#13;
and municipalities. As a result of this arrangement, the state and municipal&#13;
share of federal income and excise taxes is expected to grow from an estimated&#13;
14 percent in 1976 to an estimated 24 percent in 1984. 22/ In this instance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10 -&#13;
then, the local government resource base was strengthened by transferring&#13;
responsibilities to a higher level of government.&#13;
When less than 20 percent of revenues are locally raisedD however,&#13;
local decisionmaking may be so dominated by central government that local&#13;
government may lose all credibility as an independent entity. Papua New&#13;
Guinea is a case in point. A study carried out by the Department of&#13;
decentralization in Papua New Guinea in 1982 showed that local government in&#13;
many provinces raised only 1 percent of expenditures from revenue sources&#13;
under their own control. Thus, decentralization is threatened in Papua New&#13;
Guinea because many authorities must rely heavily on the central government&#13;
for operating funds (and advice). Nonetheless, Papua New Guinea is sometimes&#13;
cited as an example of successful decentralization.&#13;
Fiscal decentralization may work well when a well functioning central&#13;
revenue system is already in operation. The issue is not whether there ought&#13;
to be fiscal decentralization, but rather where revenue-generating powers&#13;
ought to be located in the government as a whole if local government is to&#13;
obtain the maximum returns. Brazil's cases which is not atypical, shows that&#13;
local government may be better off by having central government collect some&#13;
of its revenues. If the manpower resources of central government are far&#13;
superior to those of local governments, then it makes sense to approach fiscal&#13;
decentralization with caution.&#13;
Many local authorities receive funds from the central government&#13;
regardless of the local tax effort. In these cases, the central government&#13;
should index any further transfer of funds to performance. This approach&#13;
requires effective systems for monitoring local level expenditures and revenue&#13;
collection, which must initially be supplied by the central government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Some Patterns of Revenue Generation&#13;
The developing countries can be divided into four broad categories&#13;
according to the general pattern of fiscal responsibility at the local&#13;
level. In Anglophone Africa, for one, local government councils have been&#13;
recognized as independent legal entities, but this arrangement has widened the&#13;
gap between central and local authorities. Thus the central government has&#13;
declined to discuss matters thought to be outside the jurisdiction and&#13;
competence of local government authorities, and local governments have been&#13;
left to decide how large a tax burden they will bear. Although many have&#13;
thought that people would be more willing to pay taxes if the funds were&#13;
locally spent, it has proved hard to disabuse local people of the idea that&#13;
all development expenditures are a central government responsbility.&#13;
Ministries of finance have been eager to reduce allotments from central&#13;
government revenue sources, and the results of their efforts in this direction&#13;
have been generally unsatisfactory to all parties. 23/&#13;
In Francophone Africa the communes have been severely limited in&#13;
their revenue raising powers. All revenue decisions have had to be approved&#13;
by the Minister of Interior. Although the potential tax base of many urban&#13;
areas has increased considerably, many new enterprises have been granted&#13;
exemption from local taxes. Between 1965 and 1970, for example, despite&#13;
continuous population growth, real urban revenues declined in French West&#13;
Africa. In Senegal, only 50-55 percent of assessed property taxes is&#13;
collected each year. 24/&#13;
The absence of strong fiscal autonomy at the local level in Latin&#13;
America can be attributed to the preeminence of the unitary state model&#13;
dervied from Europe. Even in federalist states such as Argentina, Brazil, and&#13;
Mexico, state structures and organizations are highly centralized. Since the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 =&#13;
responsibilities of local government tend to be residual, the only revenue&#13;
sources left to draw on are limited to areas such as levies on property, fees&#13;
from municipal licenses, and taxes collected on movies, sports, and cultural&#13;
affairs. Local government has thus had to continue to extract resources from&#13;
the central government for the provision of needed services. In these&#13;
circumstances the development potential of local government remains&#13;
underutilized.&#13;
In Egypt, as in other Arabic speaking countries, the principal source&#13;
of local government revenue is the property tax. Other sources of revenue&#13;
include taxes on vehicles, returns from public utilities, business licenses,&#13;
entertainment, and lotteries. In the countries of the Middle East, local&#13;
government receives a share of the state-administered property tax and the&#13;
usual list of small fees (for example, those connected with births, deaths,&#13;
marriages, schools, abattoirs) and taxes on animals, entertainment, and the&#13;
like0 Egypt has attempted to launch some reforms, such as improvements in&#13;
local government budgeting, tax mapping, and so on; but it is too soon to&#13;
judge their effect0&#13;
Sources of Revenue&#13;
Personal income tax is a lucrative and easily tapped source of&#13;
revenue for central governments; and local governments have been tempted to&#13;
draw on it as well, either through a direct tax or by means of a surcharge on&#13;
the centrally administered tax0 The advantage of such revenue is that in a&#13;
buoyant economy local government would recoup more from income tax than from&#13;
property tax, since the latter is usually slow in responding to changing&#13;
economic circumstances. The disadvantage of such a system is that to be&#13;
successful it requires well-developed economies with substantial numbers of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
employees (as in Japan and Korea). Consequently, this form of taxation has&#13;
not been successful in municipal areas and even less so in rural areas.&#13;
A variation of this tax has been tried in East Africa, where a tax on&#13;
personal incomes lower than the threshold for national income tax has been&#13;
imposed by Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In Kenya, the tax&#13;
was removed from local government control in 1969, at a time when the local&#13;
government councils were on the verge of bankruptcy; 25/ and in Tanzania it&#13;
disappeared after independence. In Uganda, until recently, the tax&#13;
contributed about 75 percent of current revenues. 26/ However, the tax tends&#13;
to be unfavorably viewed by central governments in order to safeguard their&#13;
own revenue. 27/ Kenya and Tanzania eventually found it politically easier&#13;
to move from direct to indirect taxation. The potential for local government&#13;
income tax is thus very limited, and such taxes are perhaps best left to the&#13;
central government, which has greater administrative resources. In other&#13;
words, the comparative advantage of this type of tax lies with the central&#13;
government.&#13;
User Charges&#13;
The cost of local services can be recovered from: (a) the consumer&#13;
through user charges; (b) the local government revenue base; or (c) the&#13;
central government, either through revenue sharing or the grant system. Local&#13;
governments could raise more funds through user charges if only they had the&#13;
necessary manpower resources. Because administrative resources are difficult&#13;
to amass, however, user charges are often neglected. They should, in fact, be&#13;
employed more often by local authorities, since those who consume services and&#13;
who have the necessary resources are, in principle, those who should pay.&#13;
Refuse collection, electricity, telephones, public housing, and recreation are&#13;
areas in which cost recovery is possible. That may not be the case, however,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
for transportation costs, rents, and perhaps water rates1, because they are&#13;
often subsidized on social or political grounds.&#13;
User charges are usually designed to break even in meeting operating&#13;
costs and debt servicing. Broadly speaking, governments have three options in&#13;
formulating these charges: (a) current cost accounting with income calculated&#13;
to yield a commercial rate of return on the current replacement costs of&#13;
capital assets; (b) substitution of depreciation for debt servicing in&#13;
calculating the contribution to capital costs; (c) marginal cost pricing,&#13;
which charges every unit of service provided at the full capital and&#13;
operational cost of units1, in addition to current supply. As in other methods&#13;
of raising revenues, the implementation of these options requires considerable&#13;
administrative resources that many local governments1, particularly those in&#13;
rural areas1, do not possesso&#13;
Some countries endowed with considerable human resources have used&#13;
cost recovery effectively. Sidewalk construction in urban areas of Brazil and&#13;
irrigation works in rural areas of Thailand, for example, have generated user&#13;
fees assessed on property owners whose land will obviously reap the benefits&#13;
of these local government expenditures. The user charge in these instances is&#13;
a one-time, equitable fee; and the method of assessment (that is, according to&#13;
frontage) does not require great technical skill on the part of local&#13;
government assessors0 Local governments that have the necessary manpower may&#13;
find it easier to impose user fees than does the central government because&#13;
the former are known to need funds1, while central governments sometimes extend&#13;
grants to cover the full construction costs of projectso&#13;
An example from India shows how resources can be mobilized at the&#13;
local level when a community acts in a determined manner to pursue its own&#13;
notion of appropriate development objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The construction of the village school was undertaken&#13;
entirely at the initiative of the members of the panchayat&#13;
themselves. The cost of the building was Rs. 45,000. Of this,&#13;
Rs. 10,000 came from a state legislative fund; about Rs. 20,000&#13;
came from individual gifts offered, solicited by the Sarpanch&#13;
and others on the panchayat; and the rest, about Rs. 15,000,&#13;
was raised by the panchayat in relatively small amounts from&#13;
village households. The Sarpanch described the collections as&#13;
'taxes,' but they were not the legal hearth tax and the&#13;
panchayat collected them not by force of law but by&#13;
persuasion. Paying the tax, as he said, was 'voluntary.' The&#13;
land for the school, about 1.2 hectares, was given by the&#13;
panchayat as owner of the cremation grounds. The panchayat had&#13;
been their owner in the same way in 1965, but nothing I heard&#13;
then suggested taking an initiative in this way.&#13;
Other actions taken by the panchayat reflect its new&#13;
decisionmaking autonomy less clearly, but they too have been&#13;
important. They included raising Rs. 7000 for paving the road&#13;
through the village lands (an obligatory levy), and several&#13;
smaller levies to improve village monuments--also 'voluntary'&#13;
payments. 28/&#13;
Grants&#13;
For many developing countries, grants from higher levels of&#13;
government constitute 30-60 percent of urban and 70-95 percent of rural local&#13;
government revenues. 29/ Per capita grants are the most common type, but&#13;
governments may also use grants to equalize disparities between wealthy and&#13;
poor areas of a country or between populated and underpopulated areas.&#13;
Deficiency grants can also be used for equalization purposes. A great&#13;
handicap that developing countries have in trying to improve their grant&#13;
systems at the local level is that they lack the personnel to manage these&#13;
programs. At the national level, meanwhile, more needs to be done to monitor&#13;
and evaluate the impact of the grants at the local level.&#13;
Grant systems in developing countries should have a stimulative&#13;
effect on the local tax effort, and the money from the central government&#13;
should not simply be a substitute for money that the local government might&#13;
otherwise have raised from its own sources. Full cost reimbursement grants&#13;
for construction or service delivery, for example, give local government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
little incentive to improve efficiency and effectiveness of Its revenue&#13;
raising. In addition (and this is particularly true of rural local&#13;
government), grants may distort local government budget priorities, for&#13;
example, through centrally laid down requirements about the payment of&#13;
teachers' salaries. India attaches a small weight to the grant formula to&#13;
reward local governments that tax themselves more heavily, but most countries&#13;
make little effort to ensure that local government taxes are not lowered to&#13;
substitute for grants.&#13;
Grant systems should produce adequate revenues1, and this is most&#13;
easily accomplished when the tax base of the grant pool Is elastic and shared&#13;
between central and local government, as is the case in the Philippines and in&#13;
Colombia0 In other developing countries1, however, less sharing is more&#13;
typical. In Korea, for example, the local tax share of central government&#13;
revenues in 1972 was 17.6 percent; and by 1977 the local share had fallen to&#13;
10.9 percent0  Kenya, meanwhile, abolished local government income tax in 1969&#13;
and introduced a compensating grant; but it was much less elastic than the&#13;
original tax base so that as time passed local governments received much less&#13;
than they would have if the income tax had been retained0 30/&#13;
The effort required to manage grant systems should be given careful&#13;
scrutiny to ensure that the local government has the administrative capacity&#13;
to operate the systemo In a large country with a substantial grant pool, the&#13;
system can quickly become balkanized, as has happened in the United States1,&#13;
which at times has had as many as 400 separate types of grants0 In these&#13;
circumstances, administration at the local level requires skillful&#13;
managemento The detailed effort that should be made to assess the expenditure&#13;
requirements of local authorities (as the Ashoka Commission did in India) may,&#13;
however, be beyond the administrative capacity of many countries0 Korea's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
basic grant formula, for example, contains thirty separate assessments of&#13;
"need."  Considerable time, effort, and skill are required to manage all&#13;
phases of this grant. It would be useful, then, if grant systems were&#13;
assessed in terms of their administrative transaction costs. Obviously, the&#13;
smaller the number of types, the lower the administrative costs; and formula&#13;
grants will usually have lower administrative costs than project grants. The&#13;
highest administrative costs will normally be incurred with matching grants&#13;
and, of course, these tend to favor the wealthier areas.&#13;
Property Taxes&#13;
Although property tax revenues are a principal source of local&#13;
government revenues, they are not growing as fast as expenditure requirements&#13;
in most developing countries. These taxes are levied annually and the rates&#13;
may be based on fair rent, capital improved site values (meaning the value of&#13;
the land and attached buildings or other facilities), or unimproved valuation&#13;
(meaning what the ground could fetch on the open market regardless of the use&#13;
to which the land has been put by the present owner). The choice of valuation&#13;
system is in part a policy matter, that is, it usually depends on whether the&#13;
rating is to be used to encourage or discourage certain types of&#13;
development. Other factors that may be taken into consideration are the&#13;
presence of other properties (which are then used for comparison) and the&#13;
existence of a lively property market. Assessments are inevitably the subject&#13;
of controversy because they are bound to create difficulties or be considered&#13;
inequitable by some owners, but most owners have the option of moving to a&#13;
different jurisdiction.&#13;
The yield from property taxes can be increased by devoting more&#13;
administrative resources to areas such as cadastral mapping and assessment;&#13;
but small local authorities find it hard to obtain specialized staff, and when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
° 18 =&#13;
qualified people are founds they are often exposed to undue pressure from&#13;
powerful local interest groups. Government wages for assessors, surveyors,&#13;
and other such workers are often only a fraction of those paid in the private&#13;
sector. Such problems can be overcome, as Thailand has found, by centralizing&#13;
the valuation processo&#13;
Although property values in most countries have been rising very&#13;
quickly in recent years, the rise will not be reflected in property tax&#13;
revenue if local governments do not have the manpower to revise property tax&#13;
assessments within the period called for by legislation. Some ways of&#13;
obtaining additional revenues from property taxes in the Philippines were&#13;
recently proposed in a report to the Philippine Institute for Development&#13;
Studies; it recommended six changes in the administration of these taxes:&#13;
(1) since fractional assessments (that is, the practice of taxing some&#13;
improvements such as buildings at a higher rate than land) tend to discourage&#13;
the mobilization of resources, they should be abandoned; (2) the legal rate&#13;
ceiling of 1 percent of assessed values should be increased to 1.5 percent;&#13;
(3) tax mapping and records management should be more widely used; (4) new&#13;
landowners should be informed of their tax liabilities by the government and a&#13;
tax amnesty declared on past debts; (5) since assessments made every three&#13;
years place a strain on manpower and produce rather large jumps in tax rates,&#13;
all areas should be divided into three sections, with tripartitie assessments&#13;
being made each year and increases phased over a three-year period; (6) a more&#13;
determined effort should be made to reduce delinquencies by demanding proof of&#13;
payment from those who wish to do business with the government--the names of&#13;
delinquents could be published, for example (a successful tactic in Korea),&#13;
the help of community leaders could be enlisted, or the worst delinquents&#13;
could be pursued and the ultimate legal remedy of sale could be employed0 31/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Enterprises&#13;
Local governments obtain some of their revenues from enterprises that&#13;
either provide or finance certain services. Sometimes these services are&#13;
provided by a national corporation such as Ghana's National Water and Sewerage&#13;
Authority, a metropolitan corporation, or a municipally controlled&#13;
enterprise. Electricity is usually a national responsibility, but in some&#13;
places it is generated or distributed by local government. Other such&#13;
enterprises provide rental or purchase housing or service sites; sometimes&#13;
this is a municipal activity, sometimes it is the function of a special-&#13;
purpose authority. In addition, some enterprises regulate the use and&#13;
development of land, usually at the municipal level, but on occasion at the&#13;
provincial or metropolitan level.&#13;
Although little has been written about the management of public&#13;
enterprises at the local level--particularly in rural areas--here, too,&#13;
shortage of qualified staff is a serious constraint. It is not uncommon for&#13;
enterprise employees to work part time on the projects and to spend most of&#13;
their employment time on other local government business. These employees may&#13;
be paid by several different local government budgets. In these circumstances&#13;
it is difficult to assess the true operating costs or profits of the&#13;
enterprise, and it is equally difficult for the local authority to allocate&#13;
costs among the participating agencies. In a study of four local government&#13;
enterprises in the Philippines, for example (a Galeria for cottage industry&#13;
products, a restaurant, a convention center, and a slaughterhouse), it was&#13;
found that profits were drastically reduced when capital costs were taken into&#13;
account (only the slaughterhouse showed a profit). 32/&#13;
Another problem is that many small urban and rural authorities lack&#13;
the resources needed to analyze projects and prepare investment proposals for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
local enterprises. The central government could assist here by examining the&#13;
scheme of smaller authorities to ensure that local resources will not be&#13;
wasted. Furthermore, central governments could undertake a broad assessment&#13;
of the quantity and quality of management required to operate the&#13;
enterprise. They could also investigate the adequacy of the regulatory&#13;
environment for small local enterprises (for example, the rules on pricing and&#13;
competition) to ensure that external conditions are favorable to the&#13;
enterprise. All in all, strong central government activity seems a necessary&#13;
prelude to the improvement of local government enterpriseso&#13;
Credit&#13;
One other important factor concerning fiscal matters needs to be&#13;
mentioned-local governments must also be able to borrow funds if they are to&#13;
mobilize resources at the local level. The usual sources of capital are&#13;
grants1, central government loans1, earmarked taxes (both national and local)1,&#13;
contributions from local governments themselves in the form of a fixced&#13;
percentage of revenue, and required deposits from reserve accounts, cash&#13;
balances, and pension fundso The favored sources vary from country to&#13;
countryo Central government grants to local government credit authorities&#13;
make up the major share of cap4.talization in Kenya, Honduras, and Venezuela;&#13;
the Inter American Development Bank has also used this method with good&#13;
results in Latin America0  By contrast, Guatemala, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia&#13;
have used government loans to local authorities. In Tanzania local&#13;
governments are required to deposit recurrent funds each year for credit&#13;
purposes1, while in Niger the local government is required to set aside 3&#13;
percent each yearo A similar pattern is followed in Thailand and Honduras.&#13;
A number of countries have central institutions that raise funds and&#13;
mobilize loan capital for local authorities. An alternative method of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
financing a credit facility for poor local governments might be to calculate&#13;
the cash balances that local governments are required to keep on deposit with&#13;
central banks (often these are on the order of six months' to a year's&#13;
operating revenues) and to create a "soft loan" window with a concessional&#13;
interest rate, as proposed in the Philippines recently. To implement such a&#13;
proposal, however, it would be necessary to set up a national authority with&#13;
civil service status and ability to review proposals and provide assistance in&#13;
project work. 33/ Wherever credit restrictions on local governments seem&#13;
unduly harsh, policies should be examined to see if the provision of&#13;
additional credit could enhance their capacity to engage in development&#13;
activity. More liberal credit policies might also enable local governments to&#13;
employ more of their own funds productively.&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
For the most part, local government budgets are old fashioned&#13;
administrative cash budgets that emphasize inputs rather than outputs. On the&#13;
whole, these types of budgets fail to amortize capital items, 34/ tend to use&#13;
cash and accrual accounting at the same time, often estimate revenue very&#13;
inaccurately, and fail to close and audit accounts on time. Again, manpower&#13;
is a critical issue and better training is periodically recommended. 35/&#13;
Since grants in aid generally constitute 50-80 percent of urban&#13;
budgets and 70-90 percent of rural budgets, local government budgeting is&#13;
strongly affected by central priorities. 36/ Local priorities are thus&#13;
subject to great uncertainty. In Egypt, for example, only 10 percent of local&#13;
government requests for capital funds are usually funded. 37/ Uncertainty&#13;
means that more time has to be spent trying to present a convincing case for&#13;
funding to the central government, and that when resources are scarce there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22&#13;
will be greater competition between local unitso Thus, each authority will&#13;
tend to inflate its bid for funds (100 percent in excess of the previous&#13;
year's approved estimate is quite common in Africa and Asia)0 Sorting out&#13;
these bids takes considerable effort. Then, too, the central government's&#13;
review of local government budgets tends to be restrictive and concerned with&#13;
obvious financial imprudence rather than with careful analysis of the economic&#13;
needs and constraints facing local governmento 38/&#13;
Some other budgeting problems occur in connection with capital&#13;
projects in that there is often a shortage of trained manpower to identify and&#13;
prepare projects that are consistent with the national plan. Furthermore,&#13;
"spillover costs" are frequently unanticipated in urban areas where a housing&#13;
project, for example, may create the need for additional health, recreation,&#13;
or medical infrastructure.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
The past experience of developing countries indicates that local&#13;
governments need to allocate their scarce administrative resources to those&#13;
revenue-generating areas where the greatest returns lie1, instead of devoting&#13;
the same effort to all revenue sourceso Furthermore, they need to identify&#13;
the revenue sources that they will have a comparative advantage in collecting,&#13;
and then they must try to persuade the central government to assume&#13;
responsibility for areas in which it has a comparative advantage0 Such an&#13;
arrangement would help to avoid situations like the one in Guatemala1, where 60&#13;
percent of city parking meter revenues go for administrative overhead0 (The&#13;
returns would undoubtedly be higher if the same administrative resources were&#13;
applied to collecting revenues from the largest twenty or thirty property tax&#13;
defaulters.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Another common problem is that central government often regards&#13;
local level decisions concerning the allocation of resources as intrinsically&#13;
weak, with the result that local government expenditure of grant money, taxing&#13;
powers, access to credit, and so on, is tightly controlled by the central&#13;
government, which assumes that, if the local level is given more discretion,&#13;
there will be more waste. (This attitude toward local level resource&#13;
mobilization can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.) When the local level is&#13;
granted more discretion, the results can be unsatisfactory if the central&#13;
government does not help the local government to develop sufficient management&#13;
capacity. The central government should therefore use intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal relations to promote a stronger capacity to manage finances at the&#13;
local level and to promote a longer term goal of local level fiscal autonomy.&#13;
Unless successful institution-building has already taken place,&#13;
fiscal decentralization is likely to have a negative impact at the local&#13;
level. Central governments cannot assume that enacting legislation or&#13;
establishing regulations will alone improve local level resource&#13;
mobilization. Institution-building interventions (for example, training or&#13;
expert assistance with property tax administration) may be called for to&#13;
upgrade the local capacity to mobilize additional resources while optimal use&#13;
is made of central government funds. These central government interventions&#13;
may take ten to fifteen years to produce results.&#13;
III. Personnel Management&#13;
The greatest task that developing countries face at present is to&#13;
involve the growing number of poorly trained and poorly paid local government&#13;
employees in the development process. As a recent IMF study has observed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
about local government in industrialized countries,, "What is striking is how&#13;
high the local government wage bill is, compared to the central government&#13;
wage bill, in many countries where we think government is centrally&#13;
dominated."  It is indeed striking that in Japan, for instance, 69 percent of&#13;
the wage bill is paid to local government officials and that in Denmark it is&#13;
almost 70 percent. In the Netherlands 58 percent is paid to local government&#13;
and in Britain 51 percent; in other countries the percentages paid to local&#13;
government are also large (for example, in Argentina and Costa Rica it is 50&#13;
percent and 43 percent1, respectively)o 39/&#13;
Data on the growth of local government personnel in developing&#13;
countries are poor, since neither international agencies nor developing&#13;
countries maintain a consistent time series. It appears, however, that for&#13;
countries where data are available, local government has grown at about the&#13;
same rate as central government (Table 1),D and that local government in&#13;
developing countries1, particularly in Africa, is much smaller than in OECD&#13;
countrieso&#13;
Strengthening Personnel Management&#13;
Where overall personnel management has improved (for example, Korea,&#13;
India, and the Philippines),D the improvements seem to have been the outcome of&#13;
central government initiatives and a lengthy process of gradual improvement.&#13;
The performance of local government personnel has improved not only when the&#13;
central government has made a sustained effort to improve local performance,&#13;
but also when one or more of the following elements have been present: (a)&#13;
well planned horizontal or vertical integration of personnel systems; (b)&#13;
adequate compensation and incentives; (c) a determined effort, as in Tanzania,D&#13;
by central government to make officials accountable to local people for their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
performance; and (d) effective training of local officials. 40/ Wherever&#13;
these elements are linked, performance is likely to improve significantly.&#13;

Experience discussed later in this section suggests that central government&#13;
must continue to be responsible for the development of local government&#13;
personnel. Consequently, decentralization needs to be accompanied by a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
strengthening of central government's capacity to regulate, monitor, and&#13;
assist in the development of personnel at the local level.&#13;
Horizontal Integration&#13;
The horizontal integration of local government minimizes the&#13;
disadvantages experienced by small authorities having a limited resource base&#13;
(for example, they have difficulty establishing adequate service schemes or&#13;
resisting political intrusion into personnel Issues). In particular,&#13;
personnel management functions that these authorities cannot afford to&#13;
undertake on their own are carried out and ate paid for by all local&#13;
authorities, and the smaller members of the group shoulder a relatively&#13;
smaller burden. A number of countries have unified their local government&#13;
services--Ireland did so in 1926; Ceylon in 1945; and recently Jamaica,&#13;
Thailand1, Nigeria, India1, Tanzania, and Ghana. The task of establishing and&#13;
maintaining uniform standards is usually entrusted to a local government&#13;
commission or a ministry of local government. Common standards for&#13;
appointments, promotions, and terms and conditions of service introduce&#13;
objectivity and equity to local government affairs and minimize the&#13;
possibility of political interference or arbitrary action. When appointments&#13;
are on the basis of political considerations, however-as in Mexico, Brazil,&#13;
Chile,, Panama, and Colombia--the performance of local government seems to be&#13;
adversely affected.&#13;
The extent to which local government services have been unified&#13;
varies from country to country0 In Kenya, loczl authorities have discretion&#13;
to appoint whomever they wish. In Senegal, as in other former French&#13;
territories, standards for local authorities and comparable pay have been&#13;
established by national laws and regulations0   In Japan, meanwhile, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
municipal law of 1950 laid down standards for local government personnel&#13;
systems.that must be followed by all authorities.&#13;
Ghana has had a unified local government service since 1965 for the&#13;
post of clerk and treasurer of the council, administered by the minister of&#13;
local government, as well as a National Association of Local Government&#13;
Councils. In Jamaica there are two unified local government services, both&#13;
administered by the Municipal Councils Commission; one is for parish staff,&#13;
the other for municipal staff. Thailand has a unified municipal service, the&#13;
terms and conditions of which are very similar to those of the national&#13;
service. Unified local government services do not exist in Latin America or&#13;
the United States; in Brazil, Chile, and the countries of Central America, a&#13;
combination of low salaries and intrusion by political forces has weakened the&#13;
local government services.&#13;
As for wages and benefits, common pension funds and common funds for&#13;
payment of salaries have been introduced in Yugoslavia, Kenya, the&#13;
Netherlands, and France. Wherever strong central government influences are&#13;
not present, there may be considerable disparities between pay scales, as is&#13;
the case in Brazil between municipalities, or in Chile and Thailand between&#13;
local and central government terms and conditions of service. Meanwhile, in&#13;
Latin America, Asia, and Africa local civil servants are on lower pay scales&#13;
than central government officials, but the two are comparable in Papua New&#13;
Guinea, Tanzania, and Kenya.&#13;
Horizontal integration can also have useful political consequences&#13;
in that it can help to develop a local government lobby strong enough to&#13;
negotiate with powerful central ministries. Establishing nationally&#13;
administered personnel rules and regulations is not enough, however. The&#13;
national agency that is made responsible for administering local government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
should also be able to asslt with appointments, promotions, the maintenance&#13;
and upgrading of officer records, and so on. Integration also offers&#13;
considerable training opportunities and transfers that can help produce more&#13;
uniform local gover=ent responses to important issues and technical matters.&#13;
Vertical Integration&#13;
Frequently, the most pressing need is for a small number of well&#13;
qualified peoplc to look after key local government activities such as&#13;
accounting or tau assessment. Vertical integration presents local governments&#13;
with an opportunity to obtain the services of such technical specialists from&#13;
the center, but it also allows local officials to spend a period of service at&#13;
the centero Thus It offers incentives to civil servants at both national and&#13;
local levels and can increase local competence while promoting more uniform&#13;
treatment of technical lsoues. This approach has been used in Asia and Africa&#13;
with some succesco Increasing intergovernmental personnel transfers might&#13;
also reduce ovemanning In central departments. It should be pointed out1,&#13;
however, that local authorities often disagree with the center over personnel&#13;
issues.&#13;
A vertically integrated personnel system in which local and central&#13;
government officals form separate branches of the same service is found in and&#13;
Egypt, Papua New Guinea, and Tanzania, (These countries also have horizontal&#13;
integration.) In general, the system is found in countries that have had&#13;
highly centralized administrative systems and in which attempts to&#13;
decentralize are being made. Ecuador has also taken steps to introduce a&#13;
vertically integrated local government and central government personnel&#13;
systemo&#13;
3hen power is highly centralized, local and national services may be&#13;
integrated, as in China, Taiwan, Ecuador, Morocco, Nepal, certain states in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
India and Pakistan, and small island states such as Mauritius. The Taiwanese&#13;
system, which goes far back in time, involved entry examinations and wide&#13;
possibilities for transfer, and there is little difference between the terms&#13;
and conditions of service for central and local officials. In Morocco the&#13;
national government is responsible for the appointment, promotion, and&#13;
transfer of local government officials; but even with this system it has not&#13;
been easy to provide technicians and other skilled personnel to the more&#13;
remote and smaller authorities.&#13;
In Tanzania vertical integration of central and local government&#13;
services was imposed from the center. Local government was strengthened by&#13;
assigning well qualified central government personnel to help local&#13;
officials. They helped local officials stimulate revenues, for example, by&#13;
placing cesses on agricultural produce; they also helped the Rural Development&#13;
Bank to grant loans and acted as buying agents for some of the large&#13;
parastatals in the agricultural sector. 41/ Service delivery was improved by&#13;
seconded health and education officials. Vertical integration also made it&#13;
possible to get doctors, dentists, and well-qualified teachers to serve in&#13;
remote areas.&#13;
Vertical integration can be permanent, as in Tanzania, or temporary,&#13;
as in Panama where in 1970 the government promoted settlement on the sparsely&#13;
populated Atlantic coast. A settlement was established at Coclecito with the&#13;
idea of producing a model for the development of local government that could&#13;
then be used in other areas of the Atlantic coast. Initially, the settlement&#13;
had fewer than fifty settlers, and they had very few technical skills. In&#13;
consultation with the central government, the people decided to concentrate on&#13;
aquaculture, cattle, and poultry production. To assist the local government,&#13;
the central government seconded technical experts who were told before they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
arrived at Coclecito that they had to train local counterparts as soon as&#13;
possibleo Ten years later, there were almost 2,O0O people In the area, the&#13;
project was close to being financially self-sufficient (it produced meat and&#13;
fish at low prices), and it was run by the settlers themselves0 The initial&#13;
idea of obtaining technical assistance from central government was extended to&#13;
a mini hydro scheme and the production of lumber. Before long, the settlement&#13;
even had a radio station, Radio Coclecito. 42/&#13;
One advantage of vertical integration is that, when the terms and&#13;
conditions of service for all government employees become standardized, there&#13;
is both a wider pool for recruitment and wider career opportunities for&#13;
service entrants. Furthermore , each level of government is not forced to&#13;
maintain its own personnel system since some functions can conveniently be&#13;
centralized; in this way manpower and finance can be saved. The disadvantage&#13;
of such systems, however, is that, when functions are centralized there may be&#13;
delays in processing work and the system may not be sufficiently responsive to&#13;
local requirementso Also1, the least able central government officials may be&#13;
posted to local governmentso&#13;
Compensation and Incentives&#13;
On the average, central government employees are uniformly better&#13;
paid than the average employee at the state or local government level. A&#13;
recent IMF study shows that, on the average, local government employees in&#13;
OECD countries received 83 percent of salaries paid to central government&#13;
employeeso  In developing countries, however, local government employees&#13;
received only 50 percent of the salaries given their central government&#13;
counterparts.&#13;
It is interesting to note that in the Philippines1, although the&#13;
national civil service law covers most positions in provincial government,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
only about half are regular civil service employees while the remainder hold&#13;
temporary positions. The reasons for the large number of temporary&#13;
appointments include the delay in certification for entry by the national&#13;
Bureau of Civil Service, and the inability of many provinces to pay the&#13;
national minimum wage scale for employees. Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, has&#13;
an integrated public service, but top grades are only for central government.&#13;
The shortage of manpower is certainly a serious problem in a number&#13;
of countries. In Botswana in 1980, for example, 15 percent of local&#13;
government vacancies had been open for a year, the greatest shortages being in&#13;
the professional and technical fields. Several methods of coping with the&#13;
problem have been tried in rural areas, with varying degrees of success. Some&#13;
countries (Kenya, Korea, and Panama) have offered monetary incentives to make&#13;
life in remote areas more attractive. As a percentage of salary, the&#13;
allowances have ranged from 15 percent in Kenya to about 80 percent in&#13;
Panama. In Korea, the Saemaul Undong Movement (SMM) seems to have been&#13;
successful in employing nonmonetary incentives to attract personnel. SSM&#13;
local government leaders were offered greater access to higher levels of&#13;
decisionmaking in the central government bureaucratic structure as well as a&#13;
host of benefits not usually accorded to citizens of their status (a special&#13;
identification card, priority status when applying for government loans,&#13;
special discounts in public transportation, and favorable treatment for&#13;
children in the allocation of scholarship funds). 43/&#13;
Another type of solution to local government manpower shortages&#13;
comes from Papua New Guinea, where an experiment that is underway will make it&#13;
impossible for a national civil servant to be confirmed in his or her&#13;
appointment unless he has served at the local level for a period of at least&#13;
three years. This procedure, it is hoped, will ensure that national civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
servants will be aware of local goavsanEt pgob2lG    9, 2kLe provding 80efu1&#13;

Accountabililty&#13;
A basic impediment to more   i   pe6 lnoel p      iaiptio   is that&#13;
people would like but do not expect thihi local 8*Temxant to do Emeh for&#13;
them0  Thus, one argument against ch naGeing Eo(a r@Gourcee through local&#13;
government has been that the center eca cso thz Ezre afficiently.      If local&#13;
governments cannot be held accountable, ccgtiMl govaerents 3'ill be reluctant&#13;
to provide more resources for the local level and local people will provide&#13;

The accountability of local to c=2trol Governr2enT was a fundamental&#13;
issue in the Korean S1M4   Before the eatnbli5amant of S14 sections and&#13;
divisions within the local bureaucratic otructuro0 local officials were not&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
their domains, they in turn were offered conspicuous rewards for working&#13;
within the new system. One of the most striking aspects of the change in&#13;
local governance in Korea since the advent of SMM has been the improvement in&#13;
the quality of administrative support given to rural development projects.&#13;
Formerly listless local bureaucracies have been transformed into major staging&#13;
areas for serious developmental efforts. 44/&#13;
Local officials who found themselves under extreme pressure from&#13;
above to achieve certain production quotas could no longer rely on the more&#13;
blatant forms of coercion to obtain results. Under the new SMM guidelines,&#13;
mutual consultation and shared responsbility tended to temper any latent&#13;
tendencies to act in a harsh or authoritarian manner. Local leaders, for&#13;
their part, found that cooperation could reap tangible rewards for their&#13;
communities (and for themselves). In any event, they were now part of the&#13;
"system" and could not simply blame "the government" if things did not work&#13;
out as planned.&#13;
Technical central government personnel who are in charge of&#13;
development projects in the districts do not usually answer to local&#13;
government; they answer to central government in the capital, or locally to&#13;
the district administration. Although most civil servants, may be&#13;
conscientious, they are aware that, though the needs of their rural clients&#13;
are great, their promotion and service prospects are not determined by those&#13;
clients. Civil servants concentraze on those matters deemed important by&#13;
their central government masters; it is easy to understand why local interests&#13;
can become less important than the concerns of the center. What happens to&#13;
control at the local level, then? When control is strong at the center, local&#13;
government involvement in rural 4evelopment may be weakened and the costly&#13;
duplication between field arms of central ministries increased. Furthermore,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 &#13;
it may be difficult to develop a strong local personnel systemo The&#13;
insistence on accountability has had negative consequences in several&#13;
instances.&#13;
In some former French colonies, for example, a conflict arose&#13;
between the mayor representing the people and the prefect representing central&#13;
governmento Such a conflict can be overcome by having one person hold both&#13;
offices. In general, when central government personnel are posted to local&#13;
areas the lines of communications between the center and the field are too&#13;
long, and the development goals being pursued often become fuzzy or ambiguous.&#13;
A harmonious relationship between local and central government&#13;
officials working in the rural areas was envisaged in Tanzania following the&#13;
Arusha Declaration to decentralize government operations by means of the&#13;
Village Act of 1975. 45/ Despite the great respect rural people had for&#13;
President Nyerere1, they were uncertain about the rural development goals being&#13;
pursued0 After its vigorous start1, local government development faltered and&#13;
the conflict between local and central government officials grew worse.&#13;
Several problems were evident here: giving power to the "grass roots" did not&#13;
guarantee that there would be uniformity in what villages wanted or that&#13;
government would have the resources to meet their wishes; and central&#13;
government officials often ignored the wishes of village people0&#13;
To overcome these problems1, Tanzania enacted legislation in 1982&#13;
which, in addition to giving greater financial resources to local governments1,&#13;
also made the rep'esentatives of line ministries accountable to local&#13;
authorities0  This means that, in the future, personnel evaluations will be&#13;
based on accountability at the local level0 The transfer of development&#13;
responsibilities from the center to the field has also increased&#13;
accountability because local people now realize that they must look to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
local government for help--it will not come from central government. Central&#13;
government has installed monitoring and evaluation systems to pinpoint problem&#13;
areas and to emphasize the accountability of local government for progress.&#13;
Training&#13;
As noted earlier, strengthening local government depends on&#13;
improving the performance of poorly trained and poorly educated officials.&#13;
The problems experienced by the Chilalo Agricultural Development Units (CADU)&#13;
in Ethiopia are typical of many local governments:&#13;
"Communications with Addis were so poor that most bureaucrats&#13;
were anxious to avoid being posted in this remote area. The&#13;
local administration was, therefore, staffed by poorly educated&#13;
local civil servants who could maintain order and collect taxes&#13;
but who had little interest or ability in performing public&#13;
services or development related functions." 46/&#13;
Many countries--Brazil, Egypt, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea,&#13;
Philippines, Tanzania, and Zambia, among others--offer special training to&#13;
local government officials. In other countries, local government officials&#13;
must attend the same training programs as central government employees.&#13;
Responsibility for training may rest with a ministry of local government or&#13;
interior (as in Zambia), a Commissariat General de developpement under the&#13;
president (as in Niger), or a public service commission (as in Papua New&#13;
Guinea).&#13;
Some excellent training programs are found in Brazil, East Africa,&#13;
India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Among the institutions of note that&#13;
offer these programs are the Brazilian Institute of Municipal Administration&#13;
(IBAM) founded in 1953, which is a private, nonprofit organization; the Local&#13;
Government Center, College of Public Administration, which is part of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
University of the Philippines; the All-India Institute for Local Self-&#13;
Government, founded in Bombay in 1951; and the Eastern and Southern African&#13;
Management Institute (ESAMI), established by a consortium of governments and&#13;
donors in 1979. These institutions continue to be funded because they have&#13;
shown that local government training can be successful--for example, IBAM has&#13;
installed a model tax code in more than 1000 Brazilian municipalities. 47/&#13;
Part of their success is undoubtedly due to the fact that these institutes&#13;
blend together training, consulting, and research. Thus, the faculty gain&#13;
wide consulting experiences research sharpens and informs the teaching, and&#13;
instruction becomes relevant to the concerns of trainees.&#13;
Training goals are not always clearly defined, however. Some local&#13;
governments wish to concentrate on courses for councillors, others wish local&#13;
government employees to undergo the same training as central government&#13;
officials. Local government manpower surveys detailing the number of&#13;
personnel needed in particular areas are not available, and there is no&#13;
strategic planning of the type that would identify local government operations&#13;
in which training could make the greatest impact. Central governments should&#13;
perhaps do more to identify and meet the training needs of local governmento&#13;
However, training courses run by the central government and designed primarily&#13;
for central government employees will do little for local officials. Lower&#13;
level local government employees usually do not have the necessary educational&#13;
backgrounds nor do they have the same needs or problems0 Furthermore, senior&#13;
local government employees are so few that they usually cannot be spared for&#13;
training0 Cost is another factor to consider, since local government usually&#13;
has to cover training expenseso (It costs local government in the North&#13;
Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea U.S.$500 in travel expenses to send an&#13;
employee to a centrally run course in Port Moresbyo)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Local government training is most useful, however, when it is&#13;
focused on critical functional areas, for example, on training property&#13;
assessors rather than all technical or managerial personnel. The&#13;
implementation of this strategy depends on having a sufficient number of&#13;
trained employees to make an impact on their work. By concentrating on&#13;
focused functional training in key problem areas, a local government can&#13;
sometimes quantify the impact training can make on performance. There should,&#13;
by the way, be some reward for the successful completion of training.&#13;
One example of useful training comes from the Philippines, where a&#13;
USAID-funded training project had, by 1980, mapped 4,820 barangays in 160&#13;
cities and was beginning on another 3,710 barangays in 138 localities. The&#13;
area involved, however, covered 20 percent of local government in the&#13;
Philippines. Within this area the outstanding amounts owed to local&#13;
government by the five largest property tax delinquents in 1979 were equal to&#13;
one year's total local government revenue. Training helped collectors&#13;
concentrate on these individuals rather than hundreds of small defaulters.&#13;
The program increased the number of taxable properties by more than 10 percent&#13;
and eliminated duplicate records. This development was useful since it&#13;
prevented overestimation of revenues. For example, in Albay 2,000 duplicate&#13;
tax declarations out of 14,000 were discovered as a consequence of tax&#13;
mapping. 48/&#13;
In the Junin and Cajamarca provinces of Peru, meanwhile, local&#13;
officals are being trained to maintain and update fiscal cadasters, carry out&#13;
tax mapping, and manage records. The training has been instituted by the&#13;
governments' regional integrated rural development programs to determine the&#13;
financial base for local government planning. In addition to property tax,&#13;
business activity and, in particular, markets have been studied to arrive at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 -&#13;
an assessment of potential revenue generation and to determine a suitable&#13;
content for training programso Provincial development committees are now in&#13;
the process of training assessors and collectors.&#13;
Another example of a functionally oriented training program comes&#13;
from Ghana, where the government asked USAID for help in improving financial&#13;
management at the local level. Many district-level officials were unaware of&#13;
the provisions of the new decentralization system giving districts the right&#13;
to collect and retain numerous revenues as an internal financial resource for&#13;
funding development projectso Constraints that were identified included the&#13;
lack of a comprehensive list of revenue sources that could be retained, the&#13;
lack of data on the potential magnitude of each revenue source in a district,&#13;
and the lack of control and accountability measures to assure that revenues&#13;
collected were actually deposited in the district treasuryo Participants in&#13;
the training were required to define the potential revenue base for their&#13;
district, describe the constraints to revenue collection, and develop&#13;
mechanisms for improving revenue collection.&#13;
Under the guidance of the Commissioner for Valuation in the Ministry&#13;
of Local Government, the project tabulated a checklist of eighty-eight types&#13;
of revenue (such as property rate, basic rate, a head tax, twenty-five&#13;
different fees and tolls, forty-one types of licenses, and others). Using&#13;
this revenue source checklist as the basis for a training exercise, teams were&#13;
required to work on the role of data in planning, estimating the potential&#13;
total revenue for each type of revenue in the district. Since each district&#13;
in Ghana is divided into wards and each ward is represented on the district&#13;
council by an elected district councillor, each collectible revenue source was&#13;
estimated cumulatively by ward on large "Potential District Revenue" chartso&#13;
For example, item one, the basic rate, would have an estimated amount for Ward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
One added cumulatively to amounts for all other wards. The potential total&#13;
amount available for the district from the single revenue source would be the&#13;
cumulative total for all wards. The graphs were to be shaded according to&#13;
actual amounts collected and deposited in the district council treasury.&#13;
The cumulative total was always far greater than any participant&#13;
estimated. Estimated potential total revenue was usually five times or more&#13;
the amount acutally deposited in the previous year in the district treasury.&#13;
In one important district, participants estimated total revenue to be at least&#13;
4 million cedis. The amount actually deposited in the treasury for the entire&#13;
previous year was 278,000 cedis. This immense financial loss to the district&#13;
made a great impression on trainees. As a consequence of this training&#13;
program, there has been a 668 percent increase in the amount estimated for&#13;
1981-82 over the amount estimated for 1978-79, and the amount collected in&#13;
1980-81 was 422 percent of the amount collected in 1978-79. 49/ The success&#13;
of this exercise underscored the point that there are more resources at the&#13;
local level than is usually assumed.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Local government personnel management needs to be seen as part of a&#13;
national strategy for the allocation of scarce administrative resources.&#13;
Without vigorous and continuing central government initiatives, personnel&#13;
management at the local level is unlikely to improve. Although increased&#13;
local autonomy tends to be needed in fiscal affairs, the reverse is true for&#13;
personnel management. The need for continuing interdependence between&#13;
individual local authorities and the central government should be&#13;
recognized. Useful initiatives, such as horizontal and vertical integration,&#13;
increased accountability, and relevant training, have been introduced by the&#13;
central government in many countries. None of these developments could have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
emerged from small autonomous local government units. Successful personnel&#13;
management at the local level appears to call for a continuing measure of&#13;
centralizationo&#13;
IVo Allocation of Functions&#13;
The traditional allocation of local government functions does not&#13;
differ much between industrialized countries and developing countries in terms&#13;
of what local governments are permitted to do. Differences between industrial&#13;
countries and developing countries pertain to administrative and fiscal&#13;
capacity0 In the United States, for example, local government functions&#13;
usually include: (1) police; (2) fire protection; (3) construction and&#13;
maintenance of local streets and highways; (4) public health; (5) education;&#13;
(6) public service enterprises (usually utilities); (7) recreation; (8) public&#13;
welfare; (9) election administration; (10) judicial administration; and&#13;
(11) public finance and taxation0 In Nigeria, local government functions are&#13;
defined in a similar manner (Table 2), but in practice they may be shifted to&#13;
or carried out concurrently by the federal government, states, and local&#13;
authorities0&#13;
In 1952 there was one central government official for every 2,406&#13;
people in the northern Nigeria, and one local government official for every&#13;
603 people0 But by 1964, central government regional officials had grown&#13;
eightfold, while local authorities had only grown threefold; and by 1966,&#13;
58 out of 173 senior regional officers had been lured away from local&#13;
authorities0 Subsequently, appointments and discipline of local government&#13;
staff became a central government responsibility0 Then between 1966 and 1976&#13;

confusion arose over how local government should be developed. In 1972 the&#13;
central government in Western Nigeria attempted to introduce the U.S. idea of&#13;
the city manager to local authorities, but an acute shortage of managers&#13;
caused the government to abandon this program in 1976. Heanwhile, the federal&#13;
military government issued Guidelines for Local Government Reformo   The 303&#13;
councils established were to be assisted by personnel with proven&#13;
administrative and technical competenceo In addition, the Udoji Commission&#13;
recommended that local government officials be given the same terms and&#13;
conditions of service as federal and state employees, and these were to be&#13;
established through a uniform grade structure following an analysis of the job&#13;
involved.&#13;
Implementation has been adversely affected by a number of factors,&#13;
not the least of which has been the decline in Nigerian oil revenueso&#13;
Political factors, too, have been important. Proponents of regionalism&#13;
opposed those advocating local government uniformity, and an attempt to break&#13;
up the powerful Emirates in Northern Nigeria into smaller sized units&#13;
failed. The states had little interest in promoting local government1, and&#13;
Nigeria did not have the manpower or capacity to undertake either the job&#13;
analysis or the training recommended by the Udoji Commission. 50/&#13;
Wherever local government has capable personnel and a well developed&#13;
capacity to generate revenue1, it can assume responsibility for a greater range&#13;
of economic development functions. In Japan, for example, local governments&#13;
have the right to manage their own property affairs and administration and to&#13;
enact their own regulations. Local authorities deal with the maintenance of&#13;
public order; the management of parks, roads, bridges, reservoirs, public&#13;
utilities, and transportation services; the establishment of schools,&#13;
libraries, museums1, hospitals, and public sanitation services; public welfare;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
natural resources; agricultural land development; and the laying down and&#13;
collection of local taxes, rents and fees. The national government, however,&#13;
reserves to itself the right to pass laws concerning local affairs; and these,&#13;
of course, take precedence. The central government by itself, or by means of&#13;
conditional grants to local government, undertakes to provide minimum levels&#13;
of health, education, law and order, and so on to all citizens. Once these&#13;
minimum criteria have been met, central government allocates additional&#13;
responsibilities in response to specific demands made by local government.&#13;
Size of Local Governments&#13;
Twenty years ago, the United Nations suggested that the size of a&#13;
local government entity should be defined by the largest number of people who&#13;
share a sense of community at the lower level, and by the smaller group of&#13;
people at the upper level to whom technical services can be effectively&#13;
supplied. 51/ Developing countries have found, however, that size varies&#13;
according to many factors, and that even within countries local governments&#13;
may vary widely in terms of both their size and financial resources.&#13;
Independent Papua New Guinea, which replaced its district administration with&#13;
provincial administration in 1977, has nineteen autonomous local government&#13;
units, each of which has a provincial secretariat and the ability to impose&#13;
sales and other taxes. The population of one of these provinces, Manus&#13;
Island, is less than 20,000 and the island has very limited power for&#13;
generating revenue. Meanwhile, Marobe province with a population of a quarter&#13;
of a million and North Solomons province with 100,000 people have revenues&#13;
from one of the largest copper mines in the world. Thus Manus has too little&#13;
money to do very much while the North Solomons has been able to hire sixty&#13;
expatriates. As time passes, these disparities are bound to grow, unless&#13;
perhaps Manus can be merged with other areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Another interesting case is Uganda, where pre-independence efforts&#13;
to combine local government with kingdoms (Ankole, Bunyoro, Buganda, Toro) had&#13;
failed. During the Amin era local government was not financially viable.&#13;
Recognizing that the previous administrative units were too large to provide&#13;
contact between government and the people, the Uganda government increased the&#13;
number of units from 39 in 1973 to 88 in 1982. 52/ Meanwhile, in Nigeria no&#13;
local unit is to be smaller than 150,000 or larger than 800,000. 53/&#13;
The World Bank's urban experience, particularly with housing and&#13;
waterborne sewage, suggests that, when urban areas grow much beyond one&#13;
millions the management burden becomes too great for the available&#13;
resources. As the cities of developing countries have grown larger, they have&#13;
adopted more and more of the administrative apparatus of cities in the&#13;
industrialized countries. As a result, the number of administrative and&#13;
political levels has increased, and, in turn, the problems of monitoring&#13;
activity at the local level have mounted. The overall results have therefore&#13;
been disappointing. 54/ Another complicating factor has been that many of the&#13;
management strategies practiced in the industrialized countries are too&#13;
management-intensive for developing countries. For example, the elaborate&#13;
systems of property valuation, building codes, and business regulations used&#13;
in developed countries are more likely to produce chaos and lower revenues&#13;
than simpler systems designed to fit the manpower locally available in&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
Local governments that are too large will be out of touch with their&#13;
constituents; those that are too small will have little enthusiasm for&#13;
exerting themselves0 Certain factors should therefore be taken into account&#13;
when local government is reorganized by consolidation or reduction: (a) the&#13;
country's total size and population; (b) the existence of state or provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
governments; (c) regions with special need for political expression; (d) the&#13;
number of local government units that can be supervised by higher levels; (e)&#13;
the ability of the population to finance and administer local government&#13;
services; and (f) the need to prevent or promote centralization. On one hand,&#13;
highly centralized government may stifle local initiative to raise revenues&#13;
and meet the recurrent costs of centrally funded projects, and a very strong&#13;
central government may allocate more services to urban than rural areas. On&#13;
the other hand, local governments that are stronger than the central&#13;
government may make decisions independently and fail to coordinate their&#13;
activities with national policies. The point is that a balance has to be&#13;
struck between the tiers of government so that disparities of power and&#13;
influence will not be too great.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Countries with scarce resources and limited management skills cannot&#13;
afford to neglect local government or to engage in debilitating struggles for&#13;
power and control between levels of government. It cannot be denied, of&#13;
course, that some of this friction may be caused by political factors, but any&#13;
effort to emphasize either local autonomy or central control alone will merely&#13;
exacerbate the political tensions. Rather, local government relations with&#13;
higher tiers of government need to be guided by a sense of balance between&#13;
local and central concerns. 55/&#13;
The question of developing local government is often discussed&#13;
solely in terms of legal or administrative "decentralization" of central&#13;
government functions. It seems a mistake to assume that local government&#13;
can be strengthened only by giving it more legal or administrative&#13;
responsibility. In reality, the administrative needs at the local level&#13;
may change with the needs imposed by development. 56/ Unfortunately,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46 &#13;
decentralization is still being discussed in theoretical terms, and little&#13;
empirical work has been undertaken to show its real value. Thus it seems&#13;
reasonable to conclude that any proposals for local government reform that&#13;
concentrate on the need for decentralization and its implementation while&#13;
ignoring centralization requirements should be viewed with caution.&#13;
Neither is it sensible to concentrate exclusively on&#13;
centralizationo British colonialism, for example, began by focusing&#13;
administrative responsibilities at the center, but as the competence and&#13;
capacity of local government increased, it was year by year given more&#13;
responsibilities. 57/ In many casesD howeverD this process of gradual&#13;
deconcentration was arrested at the time of independenceD as in the case of&#13;
Sudan0 There the local government councils experienced five stages of growth:&#13;
(1) a local government inspector was first appointed as the statutory&#13;
authority; (2) a council with budget powers was appointed to help the&#13;
inspector; (3) the appointed council received delegated powers from the&#13;
inspector; (4) the council received a warrant under the Local Government Act;&#13;
and (5) powers were increased under the warrant in the light of performance0&#13;
By the end of the 1950s two-thirds of the councils had reached the fourth&#13;
stage. 58/ In many developing countries independence reversed the trend&#13;
toward stronger local government because politically inspired centralization&#13;
appeared necessary to counteract regionalism, ethnic separation, and so ono&#13;
Experience suggests that the existing division of functions between&#13;
levels of government needs to be carefully examined before a plan can be&#13;
constructed to transfer financial and technical assitance between the levels&#13;
of government responsible for improving personnel and revenue generating&#13;
capacitieso Such plans are seldom attempted because central government&#13;
usually has a reactive posture toward local government. Even in countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
such as Nigeria or Pakistan, which have expressed considerable interest in&#13;
improving local government, it is not possible to say that by a certain date&#13;
central government intends to strengthen local authorities so that they can&#13;
perform certain new functions as well as carry out old functions more&#13;
effectively. By and large, the task of strengthening local government has&#13;
been left to local governments themselves; without exception, the results have&#13;
been disappointing.&#13;
Developing countries need well articulated plans for comprehensive&#13;
development at the local level and coordination between levels of&#13;
government. This is not the case at present. Instead, the focus has been on&#13;
isolated activities, such as the revenue sharing system in Brazil or personnel&#13;
policy in Tanzania. Similarly, Pakistan and Ecuador have paid attention to&#13;
functions of personnel but have failed to deal adequately with local finances,&#13;
while Nigeria has concentrated on planning functions and finance but has&#13;
neglected personnel and ignored the resistance of states to local government&#13;
reform. In other words, no central governments have taken a comprehensive&#13;
forward planning approach to strengthening local governments by attending to&#13;
questions of personnel and finance, as well as the sharing of functions. Any&#13;
assistance that central governments have provided to local governments has&#13;
usually come only after protest from below.&#13;
Reform obviously needs to be more comprehensive than it has been&#13;
hitherto, but it may be implemented on an incremental basis. Nonetheless, it&#13;
is important to remember that the areas in which central government assistance&#13;
is required are interdependent. Management and fiscal autonomy at the local&#13;
level cannot be strengthened unless central government works through local&#13;
authorities. In turn, local government must be able to pay for capable people&#13;
who can generate revenues. Such people cannot be recruited, trained, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 &#13;
motivated unless central government takes the initiative to consolidate the&#13;
personnel resources of local authorities and, on occasion, second its own&#13;
personnel. Both finance and personnel considerations are affected by the&#13;
nature of the functions given local government; and if developing the&#13;
potential of local government is not made a part of the national development&#13;
process, valuable opportunities will be lost.&#13;
A Degree of Centralization Is Always Necessary. As this discussion&#13;
has already suggested, the most successful development policies will allocate&#13;
powers, duties, and responsibilities among the various levels of government&#13;
according to their comparative advantage at any point in time and a long-term&#13;
assessment of development needs in terms of personnel, finances, and the&#13;
sharing of functions. Decentralization, in the form of either legal&#13;
devolution or administrative deconcentration, is not the real issue; in some&#13;
matters, such as customs or national defense, the question of devolution to&#13;
local government is not even relevant. 59/ Rather, it is the assignment of&#13;
functions between local and central government to the best advantage that is&#13;
important. In other words, developing countries must ask which level of&#13;
government is best suited to perform a particular function. No matter what&#13;
the particular circumstances may be, experience shows that some degree of&#13;
continuing centralization is an indispensable prelude to successful local&#13;
government reform, and that the center must have continuing responsibility for&#13;
national policymaking in areas such as agriculture or minerals and timber&#13;
resources.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements for Reform0 This paper has indicated that&#13;
many complex issues have to be resolved if local government is to be&#13;
strengthened in the developing world0 There are certainly no easy solutions,&#13;
especially since little effort has been made to adopt an integrating or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
simplifying theory. Perhaps some institutional mechanism outside the main&#13;
bureaucratic stream could be made permanently responsible for these diverse&#13;
and troublesome local government issues since local authorities cannot solve&#13;
these problems on their own. Ministries of local government seem ineffective&#13;
as promoters of stronger local government; they lack the necessary power and&#13;
authority. An interesting alternative is being tested in Tanzania, where the&#13;
prime minister's office now takes responsibility for local government&#13;
matters. Line departments (for example, agriculture and finance) are required&#13;
to include local government in their work. The designated unit in the prime&#13;
minister's office performs a coordinating, backstopping, and policymaking&#13;
role, while sectoral ministries, charged with working together with local&#13;
government in the field, implement central policy and at the same time try to&#13;
accommodate the wishes of different local authorities. 60/ Although it is too&#13;
early to say whether these efforts will be more successful than previous&#13;
attempts to decentralize in Tanzania, similar efforts to institutionalize a&#13;
new series of relationships between different levels of government could be&#13;
used elsewhere with advantage.&#13;
Even when the political climate is otherwise favorable, a major&#13;
obstacle to successful local government reform will be absence of a holistic&#13;
view of government that argues for integrating the efforts of all levels of&#13;
government. Policymakers can expect nothing but poor fiscal performance at&#13;
the local level and weak personnel management if they focus on any one level&#13;
to the exclusion of other. Such an approach seems to be an outgrowth of&#13;
poorly planned decentralization schemes that also contain segmented views of&#13;
government. As a result of these nonholistic views, central governments fail&#13;
to stimulate local development initiatives. Central government's attempts to&#13;
stimulate economic growth are likely to be improved significantly with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
assistance from local governmento In other wordsD central government cannot&#13;
afford to ignore the manpower resources available at the local level; neither&#13;
can local government afford to ignore the assistance central goverment could&#13;
give toward upgrading performance of the local government workforce. The&#13;
policies discussed in this paper can help break the current deadlock.&#13;

Annex&#13;
Service Delivery Functions&#13;
Although the role of local government in the process of economic&#13;
development has not been clearly defined in the developing countries, many of&#13;
them rely heavily on local authorities to deliver basic services. The United&#13;
Nations has prepared useful classification of local systems of delivery in&#13;
various parts of the world. The dual system common to rural areas of Latin&#13;
America gives the central government and local authorities separate&#13;
responsibilities and functions. This system seems to be characterized by a&#13;
good deal of friction and a lack of coordination. The system is static, since&#13;
little provision is usually made for central government to enhance the&#13;
technical capacity of local authorities, and they themselves do not possess&#13;
the necessary resources.&#13;
Integrated service delivery of health, education, and so on is&#13;
characteristic of Southeast Asia and many parts of the Middle East. Central&#13;
government agencies administer all technical services, and district&#13;
administrators are responsible for field coordination. Local authorities have&#13;
limited functions and little control over development activities in their&#13;
areas (as in Morocco and Malaysia).&#13;
India, Pakistan, Sudan, and Egypt have comprehensive local&#13;
government, according to which services are usually performed by the local&#13;
government on its own behalf, or as an agent of the central government. The&#13;
system cannot succeed unless a substantial unity of purpose exists and&#13;
competent personnel are available at the local level (that is not always the&#13;
case). The system has high administrative costs and is characterized by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
considerable inflexibility. There is little evidence to show that it is more&#13;
responsive to public needs and demands than more centralized systems.&#13;
Rural and urban local government in Anglophone Africa is&#13;
characterized by partnerships, that is, functions are performed by either&#13;
central or local govermento Coordination is achieved, if at all, at the&#13;
regional level. Partnership, however, has often turned out to be static&#13;
rather than dynamic, with little change over time in performance.&#13;
The form of modern local government is still largely shaped by the&#13;
colonial heritage as well as new patterns of service delivery that have&#13;
evolved since independence0 U.S.1, British, and Spanish traditions treat&#13;
municipalities as separate political, legal, and administrative entities but&#13;
subject them to varying degrees of external supervision. French and Ottoman&#13;
traditions place local government within a vertical hierarchy of governmental&#13;
institutions; locally elected assemblies have legislative powers, but&#13;
executive responsiblity is often exercised by administrators (governors or&#13;
prefects) with a dual responsibility to central and local government.&#13;
Metropolitan areas may be governed by a department or bureau of&#13;
central government. This arrangement allows local activities to be integrated&#13;
with national plans, makes technical assistance accessible, and gives local&#13;
decisions the weight of governmento But such a model can develop the&#13;
semblance of remote government, so citizen alienation needs to be closely&#13;
watched0 61/&#13;
Functional fragmentation (for example, in health and housing) is&#13;
found in most Latin American cities0 62/ Many cities have very restricted&#13;
activities because of the existence of autonomous statutory bodies with their&#13;
own sources of revenue from earmarked taxes and user fees, and which largely&#13;
operate independently of legislative authorities in the cities0&#13;

Paul Isenman and others&#13;
Since economic growth alone has not&#13;
reduced absolute poverty, it has been&#13;

epitomizes the idea that poor people&#13;
should be helped to help themselves.&#13;

            Policies for strengthening local government
            in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Government performance in the pursuit of
            development objectives is influenced by all the levels of
            government, and effective public sector management depends
            on the ability of the central government to harness the
            resources of lower levels of government. Local governments
            should be given elastic revenue sources, those that grow as
            the economy grows and that are not beyond their
            administrative capacity to collect. Personnel performance at
            the local level improves when one or more of the following
            elements is present: (a) well planned horizontal or vertical
            integration of personnel systems; (b) adequate compensation
            and incentives; (c) a determined effort to make officials
            accountable for their performance; (d) effective training of
            local officials. The division of responsibilities between
            levels of government needs to be carefully examined before a
            plan can be constructed for the improvement of local
            government. Some degree of continuing centralization is
            necessary, but level of government should be matched with
            suitability for particular functions. New institutional
            arrangements may be needed if local government is to be
            strengthened. A major obstacle to such reform is the absence
            of a holistic view that argues for integrating the efforts
            of all levels of government.
