BOLIVIA - POWER SECTOR REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX - THE PROJECT&#13;
SECTION A: Detailed Project Description&#13;
1.    Background . The Bolivian Government is making extensive use of both internationally-&#13;
recruited and domestic consultants and advisors in the preparation and implementation of its re-&#13;
form and capitalization programs in the various sectors. The main reform milestones achieved so&#13;
far have been related to the preparation and promulgation of the legal regulatory framework of&#13;
the power sector, and much of the assistance received to date has been financed from various&#13;
sources. The Electricity Law enacted on December 21, 1994, was prepared during May 1993&#13;
through December 1994, with the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and&#13;
the International Development Agency (IDA) assistance. The elaboration of key regulations and&#13;
the preparation of the generation assets of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) for capitali-&#13;
zation were supported by a Japanese Grant Facility, by a small Inter-American Development Bank&#13;
(IDB) grant, and by some of the proceeds of Cr. 2647-BO. The preparation of the key tasks of&#13;
the proposed operation is being supported by PPF 900-00-BO (MOP, Para. 11). The proposed&#13;
operation will fund the additional technical assistance required by the Secretary of Energy and&#13;
Ministry of Capitalization to carry out key reform transition activities and complete the reform&#13;
and capitalization programs.&#13;
2.    Project Components. The overall TA has been organized into four parts to support:&#13;
(A) the operations of the reform implementation unit - referred to as the Technical Group - and&#13;
the establishment of the regulatory system for the power sector; (B) the implementation of re-&#13;
form transition activities; (C) the completion of the restructuring of the Government of Bolivia&#13;
(GOB)-owned utilities; and (D) the completion of privatization or divestment from GOB-owned&#13;
utilities. The following section provides the detailed descriptions of each project component.&#13;
Part A: Operations of the Technical Group and strengthening the regulatory system for the&#13;
power sector&#13;
1) Technical Group: Supporting the Technical Group by means of providing the re-&#13;
sources necessary for the operations thereof, including staff and specialized consult-&#13;
ant services.&#13;
2) Strengthening of the Regulatory system: Assessment of the suitability of current&#13;
regulations to the Power Law (and if warranted, the pertinent provisions of the&#13;
regulations to the Sistema de Regulacion Sectorial (SIRESE) and Capitalization&#13;
Laws) in light of the experience gained in the operation of the NIS up to September&#13;
30, 1996 and, if so required by the assessment, putting into effect, through the ap-&#13;
propriate channels, amendments to such regulations, particularly on the following&#13;
subjects: pricing, dispatch, quality of service, penalties, rights of way, terms and&#13;
conditions for concessions and licenses and environmental aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Part B: Transition requirements&#13;
1) Pricing studies: Execution of one or more pricing studies:&#13;
a) to review or determine, as required, the economic costs of: (i) generation in&#13;
the NIS (National Interconnected System); (ii) distribution in the NIS; and&#13;
(iii) of each IS (Isolated System) whose generation and distribution functions&#13;
could be integrated in the future;&#13;
b)  to determine the costs of the economically adapted transmission system and&#13;
subtransmission including the ancillary system reserve and reliability costs;&#13;
c)  to determine the economic costs of power supply at the retail distribution&#13;
level; and&#13;
d)  to determine a policy to provide life-line subsidies consisting with the regional&#13;
environs and causing a minimal impact to market price signals.&#13;
2) Wholesale power market: Putting in place phase I (the first of 2 phases) of the crea-&#13;
tion of the National Load Dispatch Committee (NLDC), the entity charged, pursuant&#13;
to the provisions of the Power Sector Law with implementing a wholesale power&#13;
market. Such Phase 1, will include the upgrading of the current regional national&#13;
load dispatch and transmission system to enable the prompt adaptation of the present&#13;
system to operate under the open access conditions and effective commercial prac-&#13;
tices, the detailed design of phase 2 and the following activities:&#13;
a)  adaptation of the existing optimization and commercial settlement software&#13;
and hardware of ENDE's Centro de Despacho de Carga (LDC);&#13;
b)  determination of the organization (including regulations such as those for pro-.&#13;
cedural and administrative operation), staffing and operating budget, all for&#13;
the LDC and NLDC for both phases I and 2;&#13;
c)  as a complement to Part A2 of the project, reviewing, and as required, making&#13;
recommendations for refining of the new dispatch rules, pricing and clearing&#13;
house functions of the NLDC in view of the experience gained in the first&#13;
months of operation of NIS and in line with the pertinent provisions of the&#13;
Power Sector Law;&#13;
d)  training of ENDE's personnel assigned to the LDC on load dispatch opera-&#13;
tional activities.&#13;
e)  determination of specifications for the procurement of metering and commu-&#13;
nications equipment to reinforce the existing dispatch facilities, and for assist-&#13;
ing in international competitive bidding processes; and&#13;
f)  designing in detail the configuration of the NLDC to be implemented under&#13;
phase 2, including: (i) determination of specifications for hardware and addi-&#13;
tional metering and communication systems and equipment therefor to be&#13;
procured under such phase 2; and (ii) preparation of terms of reference and&#13;
action plans for, and estimated costs of, implementation of phase 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
3) Environmental Assessment (EA): Carrying out the second and final phase of the en-&#13;
vironmental assessment of the power sector under the terms of reference prepared&#13;
during the first phase (carried out under terms of reference dated August 19, 1994)&#13;
and which include the following principal tasks:&#13;
a)  the carrying out of (i) environmental audits and of those ENDE-owned diesel&#13;
fired plants designated for capitalization and not visited during the aforesaid&#13;
first phase (i.e. plants below 4 MW); and (ii) surveys and measurements re-&#13;
quired to develop detailed action plans to mitigate environmental impacts&#13;
identified during first phase and relating to asbestos, diesel-oil and noise con-&#13;
tamination by the plants designated for capitalization;&#13;
b)  the carrying out of audits of the specific environmental and social issues asso-&#13;
ciated with the existing transmission facilities of the NIS and preparation of&#13;
action plans to mitigate any adverse environmental impact revealed by each of&#13;
said audits in a manner consistent with the prevailing Borrower's environ-&#13;
mental legislation;&#13;
c)  a review of the most recent environmental policy activities of both the power&#13;
sector and the Borrower's Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environ-&#13;
ment (MOSD), development of recommendations for amendments to specific&#13;
items of draft regulations, and assessment of the effectiveness of the existing&#13;
and proposed framework for the implementation and enforcement of the Bor-&#13;
rower's environmental policy and legislation in the power sector; and&#13;
d)  a progress report on the mitigation work that was identified during the afore-&#13;
said first phase for the facilities of each of the three ENDE's capitalized gen-&#13;
erating companies, including a brief assessment of the obligations of said&#13;
capitalized generating companies to carry out said works under existing legis-&#13;
lation, environmental regulations and terms of their generation licenses.&#13;
4) Strengthening of the National Secretariat of Energy (NSE): Development of key&#13;
functions to enable NSE to coordinate and monitor the power sector policy objec-&#13;
tives, balance of energy supply and demand, and strategic energy mix, in urban and&#13;
rural areas, to promote new direct private investment in the power sector and to en-&#13;
sure the dissemination of sectoral statistics, including the following activities:&#13;
a)  development of a power sector strategic analysis capability to monitor and&#13;
adapt the sectoral policy objectives to evolving circumstances in a manner&#13;
consistent with the national energy strategy and legal framework, by means,&#13;
inter-alia, of: (i) the establishment and start-up operations of an unit charged&#13;
with the responsibility of developing power sector policy and promoting pri-&#13;
vate investment in the sector; (ii) the assessment of staff and other human re-&#13;
sources requirements for said unit as well as its operational physical require-&#13;
ments including computer hardware and software, database, and communica-&#13;
tion tools therefor; and (iii) executing, through such unit of the activities un-&#13;
der (b) through (e) below;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
b)  (i) definition of the role of the public sector in ensuring the supply of electric-&#13;
ity in a privatized power sector, including public sector action regarding the&#13;
response of power utilities and private sector enterprises; (ii) execution of the&#13;
first indicative least cost investment plan for the power sector (with the assis-&#13;
tance of ENDE's LDC or NLDC referred to in Part B. 2 of the Project, as the&#13;
case may be) and of the procedures for harmonizing the national energy strat-&#13;
egy with the future indicative expansions plan(s) for the power sector; and (iii)&#13;
overviewing, and if necessary coordinating, the preparation of indicative least&#13;
cost investment plan(s) for the sector to promote private investment in new&#13;
power projects, including the planning criteria for addressing risk-associated&#13;
and environmental issues;&#13;
c)  establishment of: (i) a sectoral database and mechanisms to provide informa-&#13;
tion to developers regarding the recommendations resulting from the aforesaid&#13;
indicative expansion plan(s) and (ii) procedures for involving users and other&#13;
interested parties in decisions regarding power sector projects;&#13;
d)  addressing development, social and environmental issues in connection with&#13;
power supply in matters such as power coverage extensions policies, rural&#13;
electrification and service provision to isolated communities;&#13;
e)  securing sufficient funding for, and defining the scope for coordinating and&#13;
monitoring the execution of, specific power projects (including pre-feasibility&#13;
and feasibility studies) to support the indicative expansion plan(s) for the&#13;
sector, all in the framework of the Borrower's energy policy; and&#13;
f)  training for staff under the leadership of the unit referred to in para. 4)a)(i)&#13;
above, and acquisition and utilization of hardware and software for such unit&#13;
and laboratory equipment for the environmental section of the power sector.&#13;
5) Rural areas: Execution of one or more studies in the following areas in order to de-&#13;
sign a strategy to assure the energy development of smaller cities and rural areas,&#13;
and to enable the Borrower to carry out the strategy so designed:&#13;
a)  determination of options for financially sustainable rural energy development&#13;
mechanisms, particularly for the Beni region;&#13;
b)  establishment of economic and technical criteria for: (i) selecting and evaluat-&#13;
ing options and geographic areas for rural energy development; (ii) beneficiary&#13;
assessment; (iii) cost recovery and electricity pricing for both regulated and&#13;
unregulated consumers; (iv) rational and transparent subsidization criteria for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
c) identification and evaluation of at least two viable projects for implementation&#13;
during the next five years in the framework of the Borrower's energy policy.&#13;
Part C: Restructuring the power utilities currently owned or controlled by the Borrower or&#13;
agencies thereof&#13;
Assisting NSE and the Ministry of Capitalization (MOC) in evaluating options and deter-&#13;
mining specific action plans to instill commercial and financial viability to ENDE, the existing dis-&#13;
tribution companies in Sucre and Potosi in which ENDE has an equity interest, and each utility&#13;
operating an IS, all through completion of their respective ongoing restructuring; and additionally,&#13;
implementation of institutional, management and financial restructuring, including:&#13;
1) diagnosing the relevant institutional, financial and commercial issues involved; and car-&#13;
rying out financial, technical and legal studies to assess the likely market value of the&#13;
net-worth of each ENDE and IS business unit and cost center; and&#13;
2) determining preliminary capitalization, and/or privatization and/or contracted manage-&#13;
ment strategies, including or not the prior creation of a MEC, and implementation of&#13;
improvement action plans which may include management contracts with utility op-&#13;
erations.&#13;
Part D: Capitalization and Privatization&#13;

e) assistance in contract drafting and negotiations; and&#13;
f) establishment of procedures for monitoring contract performance.&#13;
SECTION B: Project Administration and Implementation&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
3.    Responsibility for implementing all components of the project relating to the capitalization&#13;
programs lies with the MOC (Ministry of Capitalization) through its NSC (National Secretariat&#13;
of Capitalization). Likewise the implementation responsibility for all components relating to sec-&#13;
tor policy matters and institutional strengthening of the NSE (National Secretariat of Energy),&#13;
environmental sector issues, and rural energy development lies with the MOED (Ministry of Eco-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
nomic Development) through its National Sub-Secretary of Energy (NSsE) under the NSE. The&#13;
heads of the NSC and NSsE, are experienced professionals with technical and management expe-&#13;
rience in the private and public sectors. Those eventual matters of the reform and capitalization&#13;
programs affecting sectoral or cross-sectoral policies and or strategies, will be dealt through&#13;
CODENA (National Development Council--Consejo de Desarrollo Nacional) chaired by the&#13;
President of Bolivia and conformed by the principal sectoral Ministers. However, since the legal&#13;
and regulatory frameworks for the power sector have already been promulgated and the genera-&#13;
tion assets of the sector have already been capitalized, it is not envisaged that there would be an&#13;
active interaction with CODENA. The specific responsibilities for carrying out the various parts&#13;
of the project are:&#13;
*  MOC:    Parts Al, B1, B2, C, and D&#13;
*  MOED:  Parts A2, B3, B4, and B5&#13;
*  ENDE:   will assist the above agencies in carrying out all Parts of the project, par-&#13;
ticularly Parts BI, B2 and B3.&#13;
4.    The TG, which will have the technical coordination responsibility under the project, will&#13;
coordinate the definition of tasks, preparation of Terms of Reference (TOR) and overseeing the&#13;
work of consultants, will assist the NSC and the NSsE in the implementation and reporting as-&#13;
pects of the project. ENDE-T will be the local counterpart in the activities oriented to put in&#13;
place the national dispatch and operation of the wholesale power market (Part B2 of the project).&#13;
Project Administration and Procurement matters will be dealt with by the respective project units&#13;
of each Ministry: the PU (Procurement unit) under the NSC of the MOC and the PEU (Project&#13;
Executing Unit) under the NSE of the MOED.&#13;
5.    The TG was established by means of the Resolucion Ministerial No. 018/94, of December&#13;
13, 1994, of the MOC and Resolucion Bisecretarial No. 01/94 of December 14, 1994, of the NSE&#13;
and NSC. In December 1994, the TG was given a wide mandate to implement the reforms&#13;
stipulated in the Capitalization and Electricity Laws in coordination with line Ministries. It con-&#13;
sists of a team of five full-time senior professionals with diverse expertise in the technical, regula-&#13;
tory, financial and legal aspects of the power sector. With the preparation and lobbying support&#13;
for the promulgation of the Electricity Law, and the implementation of the Capitalization of&#13;
ENDE-G, the TG has already established a credible track record in the coordination of highly&#13;
specialized TA to carry out complex sensitive tasks with very tight deadlines. It is expected that&#13;
the first regulators of the sector will come from the ranks of the TG because of the valuable expe-&#13;
rience gained during the reform programs. ENDE-T is the National Utility holding the assets of&#13;
the National Interconnected System (NIS) -Transmission, Dispatch and of the Isolated Systems&#13;
which will be privatized or divested during project implementation. ENDE-T has retained the&#13;
key members of ENDE's management, operations, and project management teams, to ensure the&#13;
prompt implementation and full debugging of the wholesale power market which is a pre-requisite&#13;
for the capitalization of its transmission assets.&#13;
6.    The PU was setup in July 1994 to deal with the large number of consulting contracts re-&#13;
lated to the capitalization and reform process of all productive sectors including power and being&#13;
financed under Cr.2647-BO (Regulatory Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
The PEU in the NSE was created by MOED's Ministerial Resolution of March 28, 1995 to exe-&#13;
cute specific components of Credit 2762-BO (Hydrocarbon Sector Reform and Capitalization&#13;
Technical Assistance Project). The PU which has gained substantial experience since its creation&#13;
in contracting services according to the procurement guidelines of multilateral agencies, may as-&#13;
sist the PEU as the latter builds up its own experience. Since the formal responsibilities of the PU&#13;
cover the scope and objectives of the project no special Resolutions are required from the MOC&#13;
to establish the PU' s responsibilities under the project. However, a Resolution from the MOED&#13;
will be required to formalize the PEU's responsibilities under the project. The Project Implemen-&#13;
tation Organization Chart is shown in Figure 1. The agreed Action Plan, Time Table. and&#13;
Monitoring indicators shown in Annex 1 highlight the key aspects of project implementation.&#13;
Schedule B of the MOP shows the procurement methods and the disbursement arrangements.&#13;
7.    Project monitoring will involve both a control of technical assistance output through prog-&#13;
ress reports and review meetings with consultants, and a control of timely implementation actions&#13;
by the MOC and MOED with the assistance of the TG. The outputs of the project are summa-&#13;
rized in the Action Plan and Project Performance matrix (Annex 1). The recipients of technical&#13;
assistance will be the institutions involved in sectoral reforms, namely the MOC, MOED, NSE,&#13;
the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (MOSDE), the SE, ENDE, NLDC,&#13;
and the Government-owned smaller utilities.&#13;
8.    IDA staff will hold a project launch workshop shortly after loan signing to review startup&#13;
action plans and project administration and reporting requirements. The project will be super-&#13;
vised by IDA staff through receipt and review of the Annual Implementation Programs, monitor-&#13;
ing of Semi-Annual Implementation Reports and the program of supervision missions indicated in&#13;
Annex 7. A midterm review of the project to assess progress of major reforms and institutional&#13;
buildup pursued under the project and to determine the need for adjustments will be held during&#13;
the first quarter of CY97. Inputs needed to supervise the project are estimated to total about 23&#13;
staff-weeks during FY 95 and 96. Supervision will require the involvement of specialists in envi-&#13;
ronment, power sector regulation, energy economics, power pricing, power dispatch, and privati-&#13;
zation.&#13;
Project Preparation Status&#13;
9.    Except for Parts B2 and D, the TORs to carry out all project components are ready. De-&#13;
tail TORs for Part B2 which require a prior on-going diagnostic study are scheduled to be ready&#13;
by end- 1995. While the final TOR for Part D will be prepared during the implementation of Part&#13;
C, the preliminary scope and TORs for Part D were prepared using the vast experience gained by&#13;
the TG in the capitalization of ENDE-Generation and in the privatization of the Distribution Util-&#13;
ity of Cochabamba, ELFEC. Bidding for the most urgent parts of the project will start as soon as&#13;
final clearance is received from the respective Minister's office flagging, while still required, the&#13;
processing status of the supporting IDA Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing&#13;
10.   Procurement: Procurement for services and goods relating to all Parts of the project will&#13;
be consistent with IDA guidelines and review procedures. Procurement for the project will be&#13;
carried out by the PU of the NSC under the MOC ( for Parts Al, B 1, B2, C, and D of the project)&#13;
and by the PEU of the NSE under the MOED (for Parts A2, B3, B4, and B5). Both units will be&#13;
assisted by the TG in all contractual, technical, and implementation aspects. Box I provides a&#13;
breakdown of project costs per type of expenditure. Table 2, indicates the procurement compo-&#13;
nents and disbursement categories&#13;

1995. The Country Procurement   Tia_ ___ _2 46&#13;
Assessment review has not been                                            _&#13;
carried out after the enactment of    ENraptd LA - R-e 1      50   2   4   c   6_&#13;
this latter legislation. However, a                         _&#13;
desk review has revealed a number                    TOT   431  186  341         5B1&#13;
of inconsistencies with Bank Guidelines, in particular with National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
and contracting of consultants. While no ICB is contemplated under this TA project, it bears&#13;
noting that special provisions are now being incorporated in all Credit Agreements with Bolivia to&#13;
address such inconsistencies. With respect to the procurement of consultants, the Credit Agree-&#13;
ment for this project stipulates that foreign consultants shall not be required: (a) to enter into&#13;
joint ventures with local consultants; (b) to legalize their proposals or any documentation related&#13;
thereto; and (c) to register in any local registry as a bidding prerequisite.&#13;
12.   The project will involve two categories of procurement: consultant services and goods.&#13;
Consultant services would be procured according to procedures consistent with "Bank Guidelines&#13;
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (August 1981)." TOR for most of the ma-&#13;
jor consultant services to be financed under the proposed Credit have already been prepared by&#13;
the Government and agreed to by IDA, and are available in the Project Files. The Bank's stan-&#13;
dard forms of consultant contract are already being utilized by the Government and will also be&#13;
the norm under the proposed project, including a short form letter for direct contracting of indi-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
vidual consultants for short-term assignments, and a model of Letter of Invitation (LOI) will also&#13;
be used in the selection of consulting firms.&#13;
13.   Procurement for goods will be consistent with the "Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and Credits (January 1995)." Procurement will be carried out as follows: (a) Since&#13;
there will be no International Competitive Bidding, contracts valued at US$75,000 equivalent&#13;
or more without exceeding the equivalent of US$250,000 will be awarded under Limited Inter-&#13;
national Bidding to equipment manufacturers with established servicing facilities in Bolivia; (b)&#13;
contracts for goods such as office and laboratory equipment, computer hardware and software for&#13;
the NSE valued at less than US$75,000 will be awarded under International Shopping to&#13;
equipment manufacturers and suppliers with established servicing and assembly facilities in Bo-&#13;
livia; and (c) contracts for goods such as computer hardware and software for the SNE, and office&#13;
supplies and materials in packages valued at less than US$15,000 per contract and not exceeding&#13;
US$30,000 in the aggregate will be awarded under National Shopping to equipment manufac-&#13;
turers and suppliers with established servicing and assembly facilities in Bolivia.&#13;
14.   Prior review will be mandatory for all computer hardware and software contracts, and for&#13;
those contracts for other goods equal to or exceeding US$25,000 equivalent. Contracts for other&#13;
goods will be&#13;
subject to IDA post review. Submission of full documentation will be required for all contracts&#13;
subject to prior review promptly after their signing and prior to delivery to IDA of the first appli-&#13;
cation for withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account. For consultancy contracts with firms&#13;
valued at less than US$60,000 and with individual consultants valued at less than US$30,000&#13;
prior review will cover only TORs with the requirement to use model Letters of Invitation. Addi-&#13;
tionally, single-source selection of consulting firms; assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by the Association; amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
raising the contract value to US$60,000 equivalent or above; or amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to US$30,000 equivalent or&#13;
above. Based on the above arrangements, IDA's prior review will cover about 80% of the con-&#13;
tracts financed by the Credit.&#13;
15.   Disbursement: As detailed in Schedule C of the MOP disbursements would be made&#13;
against: (a) 100 percent of costs of local and foreign consultants except for 50 percent for Part B2 of&#13;
the project; (b) 100 percent of training expenses; (c) 100 percent of CIF cost of imported goods and&#13;
84 percent of the ex-factory cost of local manufactured goods and of the cost of goods locally pro-&#13;
cured. Disbursements may be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOE's) for the following ex-&#13;
penditures: (a) contracts for goods other than computer hardware and software valued at US$5,000&#13;
equivalent or less; (b) contracts with firms for services including consultants and training for&#13;
US$60,000 equivalent or less and contracts valued at US$30,000 or less per individual to the extend&#13;
that such consultant's contracts are not subject to prior review (para. 13). For all contracts that exceed&#13;
the amount indicated above, full documentation is required. As applicable, the supporting documents&#13;
for SOE's will be retained by MOC and will be available for review by supervision missions upon re-&#13;
quest. All other requests for disbursements will require full documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
16.   Two Special Accounts will be established in the Central Bank, one for the MOC and the other&#13;
for the NSE. The total authorized allocation for both Special Accounts would be US$340,000 for the&#13;
MOC and US$170,000 for the NSE, respectively, with initial deposits to be made of US$150,000 and&#13;
US$100,000 respectively, and the maximum authorized allocation to be released when disbursements&#13;
reach, in respect of the corresponding parts of project, a level of US$ 600,000 and $ 400,000 respec-&#13;
tively. These amounts allocated for each Special Account and the initial deposit to each account were&#13;
confirmed during negotiations. Disbursements will be made under authorized signatures from a desig-&#13;
nated representative of the Borrower in accordance with IDA policies and procedures. Retroactive fi-&#13;
nancing for consultant services and related equipment procured under IDA guidelines after June 30,&#13;
1995 (but not more than one year after the date of signing) is proposed up to US$500,000 equivalent&#13;
to about 10% of the proposed amount of the Credit. The project is expected to be completed by June&#13;
30, 1998 and the closing date is December 31, 1998.&#13;
17.   Records and Auditing: Records and auditing will be the responsibility of each unit, the PU&#13;
and the PEU, which will establish separate accounts for each component and will monitor all expendi-&#13;
tures financed by this project. Project Accounts, the two Special Accounts and Statements of Ex-&#13;
penditures will be audited each year by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA and whose services&#13;
,will be financed under the proposed IDA Credit, and copies of the audit reports will be submitted to&#13;
the GOB and IDA within four months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition to financial auditing,&#13;
the PE and the PEU, under the coordination of the TG, will prepare separate full progress reports and&#13;
submit them to the GOB and IDA every six months within the fourth week following the end of each&#13;
semester. Each report will detail all project and related activities, report on the progress in relation to&#13;
agreed schedules and project milestones, and identify any problems which may have been encountered&#13;
and which could adversely affect the overall impact of the project. Detailed reporting requirements will&#13;
be established during the first supervision mission. These auditing and reporting requirements were&#13;
confirmed during negotiations.&#13;

Annex 2: THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY IN BOLIVIA&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Bolivian electricity supply industry (ESI) is relatively small with a total installed capacity of&#13;
783 MW, total generation in 1994 of 2879.2 GWh and total electricity sales (excluding auto producers) in&#13;
1994 of some 2260 GWh. Approximately 64% of the population is served by electricity and the annual per&#13;
capita consumption is some 320 kWh.&#13;
2.    The generating capacity in Bolivia comprises 306 MW of hydro (both run of the river and&#13;
reservoir) and 477 MW of thermal (both gas and diesel fired). In 1994, 48% of total generation in Bolivia&#13;
came from hydro stations and 52% from thermal stations. Bolivia has extensive energy resources for&#13;
power generation in the form of hydroelectric potential in the Andean mountain region and natural gas&#13;
reserves which are concentrated in the south-eastern regions of the country.&#13;
3     The ESI is divided into an interconnected system (the "National Interconnected System or "NIS")&#13;
and a number of Isolated Systems. The NIS covers the principal cities of Bolivia including La Paz,&#13;
Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Oruro, Sucre and Potosi, which are interconnected by a network of 69, 115 and&#13;
230 kV transmission lines. The Isolated Systems cover Tarija, Villamontes, Yacuiba, Trinidad, Cobija and&#13;
less populated rural areas.&#13;
4.    The Bolivian ESI is made up of both vertically integrated and separated utilities with a mixture of&#13;
private and public ownership, including a number of cooperative distribution companies. Before the&#13;
capitalization of ENDE-G in August 1995 (Annex 4, para. 7) generation in Bolivia was dominated by&#13;
ENDE, the state owned utility (with an installed capacity of 495.1 MW), and COBEE, a private sector&#13;
company (with an installed capacity of 142.2 MW). other public generation and autoproduction made up&#13;
the remainder. The tables below indicate the respective participations in installed capacity and generation&#13;
in Bolivia at end 1994.&#13;

Trends in Supply and Demand&#13;
5.     Over the last quarter century both the supply of, and demand for, electricity in Bolivia has&#13;
increased substantially. As indicated in the figures below over the period since 1967 the installed capacity&#13;
in the country increased by three and a half times and total electricity production, from 655 GWh in 1967&#13;
to 2879.2 GWh in 1994. Over this period electricity consumption in Bolivia increased by an average of&#13;
5.6% per annum reaching 2470 GWh in 1994. During the 1960s and 1970s the majority of electricity was&#13;
produced by hydro plants. However the share of total production of thermal plant in Bolivia has increased&#13;
steadily to approximately 51.6% in 1994.&#13;

Industry Profitability and Pricing&#13;
7.     Since the 1960s unlike most unreformed power sectors in Latin America, the power sector in&#13;
Bolivia has been profitable. The sector has been operated around the 9% rate of return on the legal rate&#13;
base (based on revalued assets for public utilities, and on historical dollar values for private utilities)&#13;
allowed by the Electricity Code of 1968. Recent pricing studies indicate that while the price levels of&#13;
Generation are in line with economic costs those for transmission and distribution need a pricing structure&#13;
analysis to reflect the consumption load profile of consumers, and weed-out the effect of sunk costs and&#13;
obsolescence of some parts of the transmission assets.&#13;
8.     A full economic impact and affordability analysis resulting from the price adjustment to reflect full&#13;
economic costs mandated by the new Electricity Law, was carried out in February 1994 by London&#13;
Economics (Consultant - UK). The results indicate that the adjustments are not likely to have material&#13;
impacts on power demand as a whole nor on the life-line consumers who by in large are already paying&#13;
prices close to economic costs. The greater but manageable adjustment required will mainly affect medium&#13;
size low voltage consumers (domestic and commercial) which do not have critical affordability issues.&#13;
9.     The relatively small overall price adjustment that is expected to be required is not likely to alter the&#13;
power demand profile in any material way. Fuel substitution away from power is also unlikely because of&#13;
the forthcoming deregulation of fuel prices that would result from the reform of the hydrocarbon sector&#13;
slated for 1996. ESMAP expects to complete an economic impact analysis of the expected deregulation of&#13;
fuel prices during the first quarter of CY 1996.&#13;

Generation in the National Interconnected System&#13;
10.   The NIS dominates the ESI having a total installed capacity of 614.9 MW (and an Effective&#13;
Capacity of 547 MW) and total generation in 1994 was 2502.5 GWh. The NIS represented 79% of&#13;
installed capacity and 87% of electricity generation in Bolivia in 1994.&#13;
11.   The NIS currently comprises the northern system (La Paz), the central system (Oruro -&#13;
Cochabamba- Catavi), the southern system (Sucre-Potosi-Telemayu) and the eastern system (Santa Cruz).&#13;
The central and southern systems were interconnected in 1979, the northern system was incorporated in&#13;
1980 and the eastern system in 1989. The interconnected network includes transmission lines of 69, 115&#13;
and 230 kV. All of the assets of the Generators are located in the NIS.&#13;
12.    The participations in the installed capacity and generation in the NIS in 1994 were as follows&#13;

COBEE-BPC&#13;
13.   Before the unbundling of July 1995, the Compafia Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A. - Bolivian&#13;
Power Company Limited (COBEE) was a vertically integrated privately owned utility engaged in the&#13;
generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in La Paz and Oruro (where it acts through a&#13;
subsidiary). Since then, pursuant to the Law, it has unbundled into generation (COBEE) and Distribution&#13;
(ELECTROPAZ). Operating in Bolivia since 1925, COBEE begun to be quoted on the New York Stock&#13;
Exchange in November 1993. Until October 1994 Leucadia National Corporation was the principal&#13;
shareholder of the company, owning 17. 1 % of its common stock. In October 1994 Leucadia National&#13;
Corporation agreed to sell this shareholding to Liberty Power/Cogentrix Bolivia Inc., a wholly owned&#13;
subsidiary of Cogentrix Energy Inc. of the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
4 of 13&#13;
14.    The former COBEE operated through generation and distribution franchises. The current 40 year&#13;
generation franchise contract was signed in 1990 and the new distribution concession for the operation of&#13;
ELECTROPAZ in the La Paz area is currently being processed for a 25 year period.&#13;
15.    COBEE operates 13 power stations with an installed capacity of 142.2 MW, all run of the river&#13;
hydro plant on the Zongo and Miguillas rivers which are fed by snow and glacier meltwaters. These plants&#13;
represent some 18.2% of the country's and 23.1% of the NIS's installed capacity. In 1994 COBEE&#13;
produced 774.6 GWh of electricity (some 31% of the NIS's total). Nine of COBEE's Power stations serve&#13;
the city of La Paz having a maximum capacity of 112.5 MW and a firm capacity of 105 MW and four,&#13;
with a maximum capacity of 19.0 MW, serve the city of Oruro. Since 1980, COBEE had suspended its&#13;
plans to expand its generation capacity. The new owner however have begun investments to increase its&#13;
generating capacity with capacity expansions of some 61 MW in the Zongo Valley. It has also completed&#13;
pre-feasibility studies for a 140 MW expansion of its Miguillas generation facilities. The company also&#13;
operates transmission lines linking its plants and the distribution facilities of ELECTROPAZ, which in line&#13;
with the new legislation will have to be unbundled and sold to the NIS-Transmission Company.&#13;
YPFB and COMIBOL&#13;
16.   YPFB and COMIBOL are both autoproducers which are connected to the NIS. YPFB has two&#13;
plants: a 3 unit steam turbine plant totaling 12 MW in Cochabamba and a 3 unit gas turbine plant totaling&#13;
6.6 MW in Palmasola in Santa Cruz. COMIBOL has three hydroelectric plants totaling 9 MW on the&#13;
Yura river near Potosi and other plants totaling 2.5 MW. COMIBOL has an installed capacity greater&#13;
than its own requirements and delivers excess production to the NIS (30.8 GWh in 1994). YPFB has also&#13;
delivered small quantities of power to the NIS since 1990.&#13;

Transmission in the NIS After the Capitalization of ENDE-G&#13;
17.   Prior to Capitalization, the total assets of ENDE, according to its March 31, 1995 balance were&#13;
US$ 523.3 million. On April 1, 1995 ENDE's generation assets connected to the NIS were spun off into&#13;
three generators (CORANI S.A.M., GUARACACHI S.A.M. and VALLE HERMOSO S.A.M. -- see&#13;
Annex 4). ENDE then became a residual company (ENDE Residual) in charge of the isolated systems and&#13;
NIS transmission system with total assets of US$ 308.8 million. The table below summarizes the assets,&#13;
debt and equity of all business units before and after the spun-off.&#13;

From the above table it can be observed that 1/4 of ENDE has been capitalized (353.8-254.8 = 99million)&#13;
and that 3/4 remain to be capitalized and/or privatized (i.e.; ENDE's assets in the isolated systems and in&#13;
the transmission system of the NIS).&#13;
18.   A summary of each of the isolated systems is provided below in paras.  . This section&#13;
deals only with the transmission assets excluding the load dispatch center facilities which also belong to&#13;
ENDE Residual. The Electricity Law states that the load dispatch installations may be owned by the&#13;
transmission company but must be ring-fenced by a separate accounting system and by reporting to the&#13;
National Load Dispatch Commitee (NLDC). The NLDC can buy the dispatch assets from the transmission&#13;
company but in the meantime must pay a full cost recovery rent to the transmission company for the use of&#13;
its assets.&#13;
The National Interconnected System&#13;
19.   The interconnected transmission consists of:&#13;
i) High voltage network. The main high voltage network comprises the transmission lines of 1)&#13;
Guaracachi-Valle Hermoso-Vinto-EI Kenko; 2) Vinto-Potosi-Sucre and 3) Valle Hermoso-Catavi,&#13;
all of which operate at 230kV or 115kV. It also includes the 22 substations relating to those lines.&#13;
ii) Secondary transmission network. The secondary transmission lines consist of sections of the&#13;
network generally operated at 69kV, which link the high voltage network with more distant areas&#13;
that have relatively low electricity consumption rates or that are integrated into regional&#13;
distribution networks. This network comprises: 1) the line south of Potosi to Tupiza and other&#13;
lines near Potosi, 2) the line south-west of Catavi to Totoral and 3) the extension from Guracachi&#13;
to Buena Vista.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;

iii) Sub-Transmission Lines and Substations. The sub-transmission lines are those generally&#13;
operated at 25kV and whose function is to connect to the main grid customers and distribution&#13;
companies in areas with low levels of electricity demand.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
7 of 13&#13;
Divestiture Issues of ENDE-T&#13;
21.     With the implementation of the new tariff regime set out in the Electricity Law of 21 December&#13;
1994, the transmission system will obtain its revenues exclusively form the users of the network. The&#13;
table below shows the proportions of the total revenues estimated to be provided by the Tariff Income and&#13;
those estimated to come from the Transmission Toll. The table also indicates the estimated operating&#13;
income to be derived from the transmission assets as they currently appear in ENDE's books. It bears&#13;
noting that these assets include a substantial portion of stranded value resulting from important variations&#13;
in the demand mix and load connected to the NIS, particularly from areas whose mining industries have&#13;
either disappeared or been drastically curtailed. It is clear that any divestiture strategy has to identify and&#13;
separate the stranded assets from those that are economically profitable.&#13;
22.     The financial consultant who assisted in the capitalization of ENDE-G will propose a preliminary&#13;
divestiture strategy for ENDE-T by the end of 1995. The strategy is likely to require: (a) the identication&#13;
of the stranded assets; (b) the best timing for the divestiture taking into account the need to find a&#13;
sustainabale solution to the viability of the Isolated Systems whose generation needs, not always timely&#13;
paid, is currently supplied by ENDE; (c) the need to fully commission the operation of the NIS and to carry&#13;
out a thorough fine-tuning of the regulations of the NIS dispatch and operation of the wholesale power&#13;
market; and (d) the identification of the operation modality and residual ownership of the stranded assets&#13;
which will have an important bearing on the book and market value of the economically adapted&#13;
transmission assets.&#13;

Distribution in the NIS&#13;
23.    Distribution activities in the cities connected to the NIS are now carried out by ELECTROPAZ&#13;
(La Paz) and its subsidiary ELFEO (Oruro); CRE (Santa Cruz); the recently privatized ELFEC&#13;
(Cochabamba); the two in which ENDE has hareholdings:, CESSA (Sucre) and SEPSA )Potosi); and by a&#13;
number of smaller independent distribution companies and cooperatives. In addition to these distribution&#13;
companies there are numerous cooperatives and small distributors in the NIS. Separate from the NIS, there&#13;
are also small integrated companies that generate, distribute and sell electricity in remote areas of the&#13;
country. The principal Bolivian distribution companies ranked by numbers of customers are set out below&#13;
(at end - 1993).&#13;

In addition to the sales by distribution companies, sales by ENDE and COBEE directly to mining and&#13;
industrial users amounted to 286.9 GWh in 1993.&#13;
24.    ELECTROPAZ is Bolivia's largest distributor of electricity and it's distribution areas include the&#13;
cities of La Paz and Oruro, through its 95% owned subsidiary ELFEO (Empresa de Luz y Fuerza&#13;
Electrica de Oruro S.A.). In 1993 COBEE (including through ELFEO) distributed electricity to&#13;
approximately 228,000 customers and sold approximately 779.6 GWh of electricity. To satisfy demand&#13;
for electricity in its concession areas COBEE purchased substantial quantities of capacity and electricity&#13;
from ENDE (and sold some energy to ENDE in off-peak periods). In 1994 it purchased capacity from&#13;
ENDE in the La Paz area representing 38.4% of its demand and made net purchases representing some&#13;
54.3 GWh (with gross purchases being 195.7 GWh). From August 1995 it will carry out similar&#13;
transactions directly with the distribution companies of the NIS in line with the new private structure of the&#13;
sector.&#13;
25.    ELFEC (Empresa de Luz y Fuerza de Cochabamba) the second largest distribution company in&#13;
terms of No. of customers and owned 70% by ENDE, after a one year preparation and promotion process,&#13;
was succesrfully privatized at the end of August 1995 through an ICB process. Out of four bidders, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
9 of 13&#13;
wiinning bid of the strategic investor at US$50 million, exceeded the net-worth book value of the company&#13;
by 25%.&#13;
26.    CRE (Cooperativa Rural de Electricidad) founded in 1962, is the second largest distribution&#13;
company in terms of energy sales. With a 7% historic ROR on its rate base and 10% overall energy&#13;
losses, CRE is also one of the most efficiently run utility in Bolivia. Also, with a 10% historic ten-year&#13;
growth rate, CRE is the fastest growing utility. CRE's management is enthusiastically introducing&#13;
strategic corporate changes to adapt to the challeges imposed by the new legal and regulatory framework&#13;
while maintaining its traditional efficiency edge.&#13;
27.    CESSA Compaiiia de Electricidad de Sucre S.A.) Coperativa Electrica Sucre S.A. (CESSA)&#13;
distributes electricity in the city of Sucre. It is part of the NIS, and purchases its energy in bulk, from from&#13;
the new owners of Ex-ENDE-G. CESSA was founded on July 9, 1951 with a capital subscription from the&#13;
State, the Municipality of Sucre (MUNI) and private investors. Up to December 1994 the equity&#13;
participation in CESSA was as follows:&#13;
Private Investors          69.0%&#13;
ENDE                        14.5%&#13;
MUNI                        14.5%&#13;
CORDECH*                     2.0%&#13;
*Development Corporation of Chuquisaca&#13;
CESSA obtained from Direcci6n Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) -- the regulatory entity which will be&#13;
phased out as soon as SIRESE becomes operational-- a provisional concession (Resolution DINE) to&#13;
provide electricity services for a period of 30 years. To date, the official Resolution formalizing CESSA's&#13;
concession has not been issued.&#13;
28.    Prior to privatization SEPSA needs to address the following principal issues: (a) formalize its&#13;
concession status according to the new legal framework; (b) normalize the status of its accounts receivable&#13;
with ENDE-Residual, MUNI and other State entities; (c) irprove its profitability by adjusting its tariff to&#13;
the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law; and (d) undertake an overall internal and financial&#13;
audit to present a clear view to potential investors.&#13;
29.    SEPSA (Servicios Electricos de Potosi) Servicios Electricos Potosi S.A. (SEPSA) is a public&#13;
utility that distributes electricity in the city of Potosi. It is part of the NIS, and purchases its energy in bulk&#13;
from, in block, from the new owners of Ex-ENDE-G. SEPSA was incorporated on June 23, 1969 with a&#13;
capital subscription from the Development Corporation of Potosi (CORDEPO), ENDE and the&#13;
Municipality of Potosi (MUNI). At December 1994 the shareholding in SEPSA was as follows:&#13;
CORDEPO             96.8%&#13;
ENDE                 2.1%&#13;
MUNI                 1.1%&#13;
SEPSA obtained from DINE a provisional concession (Resolution DINE) to provide electricity services for&#13;
30 years. Like CESSA, to date, , the official Resolution formalizing SEPSA's concession has not been&#13;
issued.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
10 of 13&#13;
30. Prior to privatization SEPSA needs to address the following principal issues: (a) formalize its&#13;
concession status according to the new legal framework; (b) negotiate with the Treasury (TGN)a possible&#13;
capitalization of its debt with USAID; (c) normalize the status of its accounts receivable with ENDE and&#13;
other State entities; (d) improve its profitability by inter-alia reducing its energy losses and adjusting its&#13;
tariff to the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law; and (d) undertake an overall internal and&#13;
financial audit to present a clear view to potential investors&#13;
Isolated Systems&#13;
31.    Large areas of Bolivia are not covered by the interconnected system, and their existing supplies are&#13;
provided by isolated systems. At present the structure of the isolated system varies from one another.&#13;
Some are disaggregated with ENDE carrying out the generation function and with either a cooperative or&#13;
other company undertaking distribution and supply. In others, a single, vertically integrated organization&#13;
undertakes the generation, distribution and supply functions. The cost base of isolated systems varies&#13;
greatly depending on their size, customer mix and density and the availability and cost of fuel. The&#13;
economic and operational viability of those isolated systems currently supplied by ENDE, on an&#13;
uneconomic basis, will have to be revised to allow their operational and financial independence before&#13;
ENDE- Residual can be further divested. The corporatization and divestiture strategy of the Isolated&#13;
Systems must permit an adequate revenue to the utility to cover its costs, contribute to its expansion, and&#13;
produce a reasonable return on investment. such that it remains viable.&#13;
32.    The principal isolated systems in Bolivia with maximum demands in the range I MW to 8 MW are&#13;
the subsystems of:&#13;
*     Tarija&#13;
*     Trinidad&#13;
*      Cobija&#13;
*      Camargo&#13;
*      Riberalta, and&#13;
*      Camiri.&#13;
33.    Besides these systems, several small local public service systems with demands of less than I MW&#13;
are scattered throughout the country. The installed capacity in the isolated systems in 1992 was in the&#13;
order of 67 MW (44% of which is owned by ENDE), and represents around 9% of the total in Bolivia. In&#13;
the Tarija, Villamontes-Yacuiba, Trinidad and Cobija systems, ENDE owns and operates the main&#13;
generating plant with the distribution functions undertaken by regionally based companies.&#13;
34.   In Tarija generation is hydroelectric and thermal (fueled by natural gas), in Trinidad, Cobija and&#13;
Camargo the production is thermal using diesel plant, and in Camiri and Villamontes-Yacuiba gas fired&#13;
thermal plant is used. These subsystems are likely to remain isolated in the medium term. Several&#13;
autoproducers exist in Bolivia with a total installed capacity of 108.2 MW, 92.2 MW of which are not on&#13;
the interconnected system. Autogeneration represents almost 60% of the installed capacity which does not&#13;
supply the interconnected network.&#13;
35.    Prior to phased privatization or full divestiture, these Isolated Systems need to enhance their&#13;
marketability. To a greater or lesser extent they have to address the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
11 of 13&#13;
*  formalize and adapt their concession status according to the new legal framework;&#13;
*  for SETAR only: negotiate with the Treasury (TGN) a possible capitalization of its debt with USAID,&#13;
Argentina (Salta State), and the Bolivian Central Bank;&#13;
*  normalize the status of their accounts receivable and payable with ENDE, municipalities and other&#13;
State entities;&#13;
*  for the distribution utilities: improve their profitability by inter-alia reducing energy losses and&#13;
adjusting their tariff to the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law;&#13;
*  for the generation utilities: evaluate the regional tariff impact of applying the rates mandated by the&#13;
Electricity Law, and if appropriate design a short term tariff adjustment program;&#13;
*  undertake an overall internal and financial audit to present a clear view to potential investors; and&#13;
*  decide on the most appropriate degree of integration required in each case prior to privatization.&#13;
36.   The table at the end of this annex provides a summary of key physical, operational, financial data&#13;
and and indication of the main types of issues that need to be addressed in the course of their respective&#13;
corporatizations and/or privatizations.&#13;
Tarija Subsystems&#13;
37.    SETAR (Servicios Electricos Tarija S.A.) distributes electricity in the cities of Tarija and its&#13;
surrounding areas (Central System) which includes the towns: Yacuiba, Villamontes, and Bermejo, and&#13;
generates and distributes electricity in the town of Entre Rios. The whole system is not Part of the NISand&#13;
the energy for the system is purchased in bulk from ENDE- Tarija (part of ENDE-Residual) except for&#13;
Entre-Rios which has its own generation. SETAR operates through five companies in separate subsystems.&#13;
Households consume the largest share of electricity (24.5 GWh), followed by commercial (5.1 GWh) and&#13;
industrial uses (3.9 GWh). Generation in Tarija is mixed. The hydro and thermal plants are all owned and&#13;
operated by ENDE. Expansion of the systems at Tarija and Villamontes-Yacuiba will be based on&#13;
generating units fueled by natural gas with capacities of around 2 MW and 5 MW, respectively. SETAR&#13;
was incorporated on April 7, 1969 with a capital subscription from the State, the Municipality of Tarija&#13;
(MUNI) and the Development Corporation of Tarija (CODETAR). Up to December 1994 the&#13;
shareholding in SETAR was as follows:&#13;
CODETAR              54.0%&#13;
ENDE                43.6%&#13;
MUNI                 2.4%&#13;
38.    ENDE-Tarija, part of ENDE Residual, is in charge of the generation of electricity in the&#13;
Tarija region which includes the city of Tarija and its surroundings (Tarija Central) since 1979,&#13;
Villamontes since 1981, Yacuiba since 1992 and Bermejo since October 1994. The subsystems of&#13;
Yacuiba and Villamontes were interconnected with each other at the end of 1993. The energy&#13;
generated by ENDE is sold in bulk to SETAR, which is in charge of the distribution of electricity&#13;
in all these cities. The generation of electricity in this system is with diesel engines in the Villa&#13;
Abaroa plants, gas in the Villamontes, Yacuiba and Bermejo plants, and hydro in San Jacinto and&#13;
Angosto.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
12 of 13&#13;
Trinidad Subsystem (Beni)&#13;
39.    COSERELEC (Cooperativa de Servicios Electricos Trinidad LTDA) established as a cooperative&#13;
on September 5, 1967, distributes electricity in the city of Trinidad and its surrounding areas, purchases&#13;
bulk energy, from ENDE-Trinidad (part of ENDE-Residual) has a provisional supply concession in the&#13;
Beni region, and employs 55 staff. The cooperative has no generation capacity. Consumption in El Beni&#13;
follows a similar structure to that of Tarija. Households account for the largest share of consumption (7.5&#13;
GWh), followed by commercial (2.4 GWh) and industrial (1.8 GWh) uses. Generation is by diesel plant&#13;
owned and operated by ENDE. In Trinidad, until if and when natural gas is available, the expansion plan&#13;
will be based on diesel generating units, with capacities of about 3MW.&#13;
40.   ENDE-Trinidad (part of ENDE Residual) since 1981, is in charge of generating electricity in the&#13;
city of Trinidad, and sells its energy in bulk to COSERELEC, which is in charge of the distribution of&#13;
electricity in that city. The generation of electricity is with diesel engines located in Trinidad and Moxos.&#13;
Cobija Subsystem (Pando)&#13;
41.   The Cobija subsystem in the Pando area, previously owned by the Pando Development&#13;
Corporation (CORDEPANDO) is 100% owned by ENDE since August 1991, when ENDE was forced to&#13;
take over. It has 15 full time and 5 part time employees. The structure of consumption in Pando is similar&#13;
to that of Tarija and Beni. Households account for the largest share of consumption (53.5%), followed by&#13;
commercial (43%) and other uses(3.5%).&#13;
Riberalta Sub-System&#13;
CER (Cooperativa Electrica de Riberalta) has been in operation for over 30 years. Riberalta is a&#13;
community of approximately 46,000 inhabitants situated on the northern frontier of Bolivia with Brazil at&#13;
the confluence of the Madre de Dios and Rio Beni Rivers. The principal industries are brazil nut&#13;
production and wood processing. CER has been providing 24-hour services to the community for over 30&#13;
years. The plant is currently comprised of medium and high speed diesel engines with a total installed&#13;
capacity of approximately 1.5 MW. Diesel is transported overland and by river to the city to be used in&#13;
power production. Shortfalls in availability are often experienced during months of heavy rains due to the&#13;
frequent difficulties in transportation.&#13;
Although CER has had little assistance from the central government, the cooperative has managed to&#13;
maintain a fairly high level of reliability and provided electricity at more or less affordable prices. Electric&#13;
energy costs US$ 0.22 per kilowatt hour with no demand charges. But while the cooperative is solvent, it&#13;
does not have the financial means to make the necessary investments in additional generation capacity,&#13;
investmnents that are very important to the future of the economic growth of the community. Capacity will&#13;
need to double to be able to provide the energy required by local industry to meet the additional demand&#13;
that will be experienced through mechanisation of the brazil nut processing plants and sawmills.&#13;
Interconnection in the near future with the national grid is unrealistic, so the cooperative will have to plan&#13;
its own generation expansion for perhaps twenty years into the future. It will have to operate independently&#13;
of all other institutions for many years to come. While the cooperative has managed to provide power at&#13;
affordable prices to its members, and while it may be able to do so for some years into the future, it is&#13;
evident that assistance is required from a central agency, be it private or public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
13 of 13&#13;
In this case, while the cooperative has established an operational structure that is adequate for daily&#13;
functions, it has not been successful in solving longer term problems. There does not exist an institution&#13;
that has been established in Bolivia to assist in the process of electrification planning or financing, and&#13;
therefore in cases like this, the cooperative is left to its own means to seek the financial and technical&#13;
assistance for future expansion.&#13;

ANNEX 3: THE NEW LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK&#13;
AND INDUSTRY STRUCTURE&#13;
The Electricity Law and New Industry Structure&#13;
1.            The Electricity Law, Law No. 1604 of 21 December 1994 replaces the 'Electricity&#13;
Code' enacted in 1968 and establishes new principles governing concessions, licenses, tariffs, rights&#13;
of wav, penalties, etc. This section summarizes the key provisions of the law. Regulations relating&#13;
to the electricity sector pursuant to the Electricity Law (para. 2.5) were enacted in June 1995.&#13;
Principles of the Law&#13;
2.     The Electricity Law sets out the following principles for the electricity industry:&#13;
*  efficiency: the correct and optimal allocation and utilization of resources in the supply&#13;
of electricity at minimum cost,&#13;
*  transparency: transparency in the regulatory system established in the SIRESE and&#13;
Electricity laws,&#13;
*  quality: compliance with the technical requirements to be established in the&#13;
Regulations.&#13;
-  continuity: a continuous electricity supply without unjustified interruptions;&#13;
-  adaptability: the use of modern technology and administrative systems to promote&#13;
quality and efficiency; and&#13;
*  neutrality: the impartial treatment of all electricity companies and consumers.&#13;
New Industry Structure&#13;
3.     The Law provides for the introduction (subject to the law) of a freely competitive&#13;
electricity market and the dissagregation of the electricity industry in the NIS into separate&#13;
generation, transmission, distribution and dispatch activities. The Isolated Systems may be&#13;
vertically integrated. A company in the NIS may only be engaged in one of generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution activities.&#13;
4.     The Law restricts the common ownership of generation, transmission and distribution.&#13;
Generation or distribution companies (or certain related entities) may not own any shares in, or&#13;
exercise management control of, a transmission company and transmission companies (or certain&#13;
related entities) may not own shares in, or exercise management control of, a generation or&#13;
distribution company. Similarly, a generation company (or certain related entities) may not own&#13;
any shares in, or exercise management control of, a distribution company and a distribution&#13;
company mav not own anv shares in, or exercise management control of, a generation company.&#13;
5.     Distributors connected to the NIS are not allowed to own, directly or indirectly, any&#13;
generating capacity, likewise generators are not allowed to own shares in distribution companies.&#13;
6.     The law also contains provisions relating to the relative size of generation companies and&#13;
stipulates that a generation company (or certain related entities) may not oun, directly or&#13;
indirectly, more than 35% of the installed capacity in the NIS (excluding capacity utilized for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
2 of 6&#13;
electricity exports). However, the Superintendency of Electricity ("SE") can authorize temporary&#13;
exceptions to this limit.&#13;
7.    All generators in the NIS will be subject to dispatch by the Comite Nacional de Despacho&#13;
de Carga ("CNDC") and may enter into Electricity Supply Contracts ("ESCs") with other&#13;
generators, Distributors or Unregulated Consumers.&#13;
8.     Open access to transmission in the NIS will be available to all electricity companies and&#13;
Unregulated Consumers. A transmission company may not buy or sell electricity.&#13;
9.     The CNDC will be responsible for the coordination of generation, transmission and&#13;
dispatch in the NIS to achieve minimum cost. The CNDC will be formed by a representative of the&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution companies respectively, a representative of the&#13;
Unregulated Consumers and a representative of the SE. The dispatch center of the CNDC will be&#13;
owned by the transmission company owning the Trunk Interconnected System although the SE has&#13;
the power to order the creation of an independent company to owvn the dispatch center which would&#13;
be owned by the electricity companies and Unregulated Consumers. The Law provides for the full&#13;
recovery of the operating costs of dispatch and of managing the commrercial transactions of the&#13;
wholesale power market.&#13;
The functions of the CNDC include:&#13;
-  to plan the integrated operation of the NIS with the aim of satisfying demand through&#13;
secure, liable and minimum cost operation;&#13;
-  to carry out dispatch; to calculate the effective capacity of generators in the NIS; and&#13;
to calculate node prices in the NIS and present them to the SE for approval.&#13;
10.   In order to promote a rational utilization of primary resources in Bolivia, the Executive&#13;
Power may define the minimum participation of hydroelectric capacity in the NIS.&#13;
Institutional organization&#13;
11.    Under the Electricity Law the National Secretary of Energy (SNE) will propose general&#13;
regulations for approval by the Executive Power which will be applied by the SE. The National&#13;
Secretarv of Energy will also develop an indicative plan (which will be for reference purposes only)&#13;
i.e. a minimum cost plan for generation and transmission projects (which will include projects&#13;
proposed by any generators and the National Secretary of Energy), necessary to cover the next ten&#13;
years increase in electricity demand in the NIS. The SNE will normally update the indicative plan&#13;
on a yearly basis.&#13;
12.    The SE will act as the regulator of the electricity industry and will be headed by a&#13;
Superintendent. In addition to the general powers set out in the SIRESE Law (para. 18) the&#13;
Superintendent of Electricity will have the specific powers in the Electricity Law to:&#13;
*  protect consumers rights;&#13;
*  ensure that the activities of the electricity industry comply with the antimonopoly and&#13;
consumer protection provisions of the SIRESE, Electricity and Environmental Laws&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
3 of 6&#13;
and respective Regulations; grant and amend concessions, Licenses and provisional&#13;
licenses in line with these Regulations;&#13;
*  intervene in utilities which have not complied with the Electricity Law and its&#13;
Regulations;&#13;
*  apply the tariff and price setting procedures established in the Electricity Law and its&#13;
Regulations for generation, transmission and distribution and approve and regulate&#13;
maximum prices and tariffs;&#13;
* approve international interconnections and the export and import of electricity;&#13;
supervise the CNDC; and apply penalties.&#13;
13.    The operations of the SE and a proportionate part of the operating costs of the General&#13;
Superintendency will be financed by a regulatory levy to be paid by electricity companies which&#13;
cannot exceed 1 % of their sales revenues before indirect taxes. Their initial capital costs will be&#13;
co-financed by multilateral and bilateral loans and grants.&#13;
Concessions and Licenses&#13;
14.    Under the Electricity Law, Distributors and integrated companies in the Isolated Systems&#13;
will operate under the terms of public service concessions with a maximum period of 40 years.&#13;
Generators and Transmitters in the NIS will be authorized to operate by Licenses of indefinite&#13;
duration. Authority to conduct studies for certain new generation plants or transmission capacity&#13;
(utilizing natural resources, or public goods or requiring the imposition of rights of way) will&#13;
require a provisional license (which will provide a preferential right to obtain a License for the&#13;
project at a later stage). All concessions, Licenses and provisional licenses will be granted by the&#13;
SE through two alternative procedures being either at the request of interested parties or through&#13;
public tenders. The applicability of each procedure, the mechanisms for applying for concessions,&#13;
Licenses and provisional licenses and provisions relating to the termination and revocation of&#13;
concessions and Licenses are set out in the Electricity Law and Regulations.&#13;
15.    Distributors, under their concessions will have an obligation to satisfy all demand for&#13;
electricity in their concession area. To fulfill this obligation the law requires them to enter into&#13;
Electricity Supply Contracts (ESI) with generators covering a minimum of 80% of their maximum&#13;
demand for a minimum period of three years. The percentage and the period may be modified by&#13;
the SE.&#13;
Prices and Tariffs&#13;
16.    The Electricity Law and the Regulations provide for the introduction of a new system of&#13;
pricing and tariffs for the electricity sector based on marginal costs for Generation and&#13;
Transmission, and on price-cap (RPI - X) incentive regulation for Distribution.&#13;
Transitional Provisions&#13;
17.    The Electricity Law contains a number of transitional provisions governing the transition&#13;
from the existing to the new industry framework. These provisions include the following:&#13;
* that the dissaggregation of the industry in accordance with the law should be achieved within&#13;
18 months;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
4 of6&#13;
*  that subject to certain exceptions, until 31 December 1999 generators currently operating in&#13;
the NIS and the CGCs (Capitalized Generating Companies) will have exclusivity in the&#13;
obtaining of new&#13;
*  generating licenses in the NIS. Up to 31 December 1998 the granting of Licenses for the&#13;
export of electricitv will be restricted to generators currently operating in the NIS and the&#13;
CGCs;&#13;
* that ENDE will cede to the CGCs certain ESCs;&#13;
*  that for a maximum period of seven years, the SE will define the procedures for implementing&#13;
the tariff provisions applicable to generation concessions granted prior to the coming into&#13;
effect of the law; and&#13;
*  that for a period of five years, consumers within the concession areas of Distributors which&#13;
wish to act as Unregulated Consumers must obtain the authorization of the SE.&#13;
THE SIRESE LAW AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK&#13;
18.    Law No. 1600 of 28 October 1994 has established a new sectoral regulatory system for&#13;
Bolivia called the "Sistema de Regulaci6n Sectorial" or "SIRESE". This new sectoral regulation&#13;
covers the telecommunications, electricity, hydrocarbon, transport and water sectors and can be&#13;
expanded to cover other sectors in the future.&#13;
19.   The SIRESE has been created as an autonomous entity under the auspices of the Ministry&#13;
of Economic Development and is based on a two tier structure comprising a General&#13;
Superintendency and a series of Sectoral Superintendencies. The General Superintendency will&#13;
oversee the activities of the SIRESE and the Sectoral Superintendencies and will be headed by a&#13;
Superintendent General who, except during an initial transition period, will hold office for 7 years.&#13;
Each Sectoral Superintendency will be headed by a Sectoral Superintendent who will hold office,&#13;
except during an initial transition period, for a period of 5 years. The Superintendent General and&#13;
Sectoral Superintendents will be independent and are not allowed to have any economic interest in&#13;
the areas for which they are responsible.&#13;
20.    Both the General Superintendent and each of the Sectoral Superintendents will be&#13;
designated by the President of the Republic of Bolivia from among the groups of three candidates&#13;
proposed by a two thirds majority vote of the Senate.&#13;
21.    Although each of the new sectoral laws (such as the Electricity Law) will set out specific&#13;
powers for the Sectoral Superintendents, the SIRESE law sets out a number of general powers&#13;
including:&#13;
*  promoting competition and efficiency and investigating monopolistic, anti-competitive&#13;
and discriminatory practices against the public interest;&#13;
*  granting, modifying, renewing and deciding on the expiry or revocation of concessions&#13;
and licenses under the provisions of the sectoral law; overseeing the carrying out of&#13;
investment commitments;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
5 of 6&#13;
*  approving and publishing prices and tariffs in accordance with the relevant sectoral&#13;
laws and supervising their correct application;&#13;
*  applying penalties where provided for in sectoral laws or in concession or license&#13;
contracts; and&#13;
*  processing complaints and claims by users, regulated companies and the state.&#13;
22.    Electricity sector companies will have a right to appeal to the Superintendent General&#13;
against decisions of the Superintendency of Electricity and a further right of appeal to the Supreme&#13;
Court.&#13;
23.    The SIRESE law contains a number of anti-monopolistic and competition provisions.&#13;
These provisions require that, except as provided for in sectoral laws and regulations, companies in&#13;
the electricity&#13;
and other regulated sectors must carry out their activities in a manner which promotes free&#13;
competition and must avoid acts which would impede, restrict or distort it. The law also provides&#13;
that companies in the electricity and other regulated sectors are prohibited from participating in&#13;
agreements or arrangements whose purpose or effect is to impede, restrict or distort free&#13;
competition through price fixing, control of production, markets, sources of supply or investments&#13;
or other similar activities. In addition, the law includes provisions to combat abusive and anti-&#13;
competitive commercial practices which are damaging to competitors, clients or users. Mergers of&#13;
competing companies subject to regulation are prohibited where they would establish, promote or&#13;
consolidate a dominant market position.&#13;
Secondary Legislation&#13;
24.    Detailed provisions implementing the Electricity Law are contained in secondary&#13;
legislation or Regulations. These were passed by supreme decree and any future revision do not&#13;
require Congressional approval.&#13;
25.   The main Regulations which will be implemented pursuant to the Electricity Law cover the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
*  Prices and Tariffs ('Precios y Tarifas')&#13;
*  Operation ('operacion')&#13;
*  Quality of supply ('Calidad de Suministro')&#13;
*  Infringements and Penalties ('Infracciones y Sanciones')&#13;
* Concessions and Licenses ('Concesiones y Licencias')&#13;
*  Rights of Way ('Servidumbres')&#13;
26.   In addition, Regulations will be implemented pursuant to the SIRESE Law governing the&#13;
creation of the General Superintendency and the Sectoral Superintendencies.&#13;
27.    The Regulations of the SIRESE Law are currently being finalized and final drafts have&#13;
been issued to the main stakeholders for comments. They are expected to be enacted before mid&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
6 of 6&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION&#13;
28.   An environmental legislative and regulatory structure for Bolivia is in the course of being&#13;
developed. The Environmental Law No. 1333 of 27 April 1992 forms the basis for the system of&#13;
environmental legislation. Various regulations pursuant to the law (including regulations relating&#13;
to environmental impact assessments, air pollution, water pollution and the control and&#13;
management of hazardous wastes) are under development.&#13;
29.   Other legislation which has been passed and is relevant to the environment includes:&#13;
*  the Law of Ministries ('Ley de Ministerios del Poder Ejecutivo') No. 1493 of 17 June&#13;
1993 and its regulations which identify the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
the Environment (the 'Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente') as the&#13;
key governnent agency responsible for the conservation and protection of the&#13;
environment; and&#13;
*  the Regulation on the Disposal of Industrial Wastes to Bodies of Water No. 010/85 of&#13;
28 November 1990.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
1 of 4&#13;
ANNEX 4: THE CAPITALIZATION AND BIDDING PROGRAM&#13;
OF GENERATION ASSETS&#13;
THE CAPITALIZATION CONCEPT&#13;
1.    As part of a wider ranging reform program, the Government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de&#13;
Lozada has introduced a Capitalization Program to transfer six of the most important state-owned&#13;
enterprises to the private sector. The six companies earmarked for capitalization are:&#13;
Company              Sector&#13;
ENDE          Electricity&#13;
YPFB          Oil and Gas&#13;
ENTEL         Telecommunications&#13;
LAB           Airline&#13;
ENFE          Railway&#13;
ENAF          Mining and Metallurgy&#13;
2.     The basis for this program is set out in the Capitalization Law No. 1554 of 21 March 1994. The&#13;
program has a number of aims, including:&#13;
*  to issue shares representing up to 50% holdings, and to transfer management control of, the six&#13;
companies to the private sector;&#13;
*  to bring into Bolivia significant amounts of fresh investment capital to fund infrastructure and&#13;
industrial development in the six sectors; and&#13;
*  to create national pension fund schemes to provide, for the first time, pensions to the entire&#13;
Bolivian people. This will be structured and regulated by a new pensions law.&#13;
3.     Under the Capitalization Program each of the enterprises to be Capitalized will first be transformed&#13;
into a mixed economy corporation (a "S.A.M."), that is a corporation owned partially by state and partially&#13;
by private interests (being initially workers in the company) since under Bolivian law only a corporation&#13;
can issue shares. An international tender will then be held to select the investor or group of investors which&#13;
will subscribe for new shares representing 50% of the share capital of the S.A.M.s. The subscribed capital&#13;
will be doubled by the issue of the new shares. The subscription moneys will be paid into the S.A.M.s and&#13;
will be available to fund future investments. The Government will receive no proceeds from the&#13;
Capitalizations and following the Capitalization, the S.A.M.'s will be converted into S.A.'s signaling the&#13;
end of the Governments participation as a shareholder in the companies.&#13;
4.     The work force of the state-owned company from which a S.A.M. is formed will be entitled to&#13;
subscribe for shares in the S.A.M. up to the amount of their Social Benefits. The remaining shares in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
2 of 4&#13;
S.A.M.s will be used to establish a new national pension fund scheme. These shares will be held initially&#13;
by the Trustee/Custodian, which will be a leading international bank in the provision of trustee and&#13;
custodian services. In due course, the Bolivian pension funds will wish to achieve liquidity for their&#13;
shareholdings in the capitalized companies to enable them to diversify their portfolios and satisfy their&#13;
obligations to pay pensions. It is therefore anticipated that each of the capitalized corporations will be&#13;
listed in due course on Bolivian and other stock exchanges.&#13;
5.     As a necessary adjunct to the Capitalization Program, the Government has introduced a new&#13;
regulatory regime covering the telecommunications, electricity, hydrocarbon, transport and water sectors.&#13;
The new SIRESE Law No. 1600 of 28 October 1994 which creates a new system of sectoral regulation&#13;
(the "Sistema de Regulacion Sectorial" or "SIRESE') is described in more detail in Annex 3, para. 18.&#13;
6.    In parallel with the Capitalization Program, a more traditional privatization program is being&#13;
implemented covering a variety of smaller state owned enterprises in activities ranging from agriculture and&#13;
cement to textiles and hotels.&#13;
OVERVIEW OF THE NEW GENERATORS&#13;
7.    The principal summary data of the three new Generators fonned from the generating assets of&#13;
ENDE located in the NIS are set out below:&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF&#13;
THE POWER SECTOR IN BOLIA (PHASE II)&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Under the proposed Capitalization and Reform of the Power Sector undertaken by the Government of Bolivia the&#13;
National Electricity Company (ENDE) is to capitalize its assets into the following business units: Gl, G2, G3 and&#13;
Transmission. To ensure that the proposed reform and ensuing legislation meets sound environmental guidelines,&#13;
the Government wishes to carry out an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the power sector in two phases.&#13;
The first phase - an environmental audit of ENDE's generating plant over 4 MW, and a full institutional and&#13;
legislative review - has been carried out by a Consultant. The environmental audits of the generating plant&#13;
included hydro-electric and thermal (diesel and gas) plants, and produced a series of action plans to address&#13;
significant issues of concern which were identified. The institutional study examined whether the institutional and&#13;
legal structure in place in Bolivia is sufficient to ensure sustainability and effective regulation of environmental&#13;
objectives after sector reform and the capitalization of ENDE.&#13;
These TOR relate to Phase 2 of work to be undertaken and reflect the findings of the Phase I study and the&#13;
progress that has been made in environmental policy and regulation since the completion of that work.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW OF THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Environmental audits completed for this study will comply with all environmental guidance, laws and regulations&#13;
of Bolivia as well as the World Bank requirements included in the Banks Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 of&#13;
October 1991 as applicable to environmental category "B" projects; whenever necessary other international&#13;
standards or guidelines will be used prior agreement within the Government and the Bank. The Consultant will&#13;
develop a thorough understanding of the power sector of Bolivia. The Consultant will obtain from ENDE&#13;
information on the existing power generating and transmission system and the expansion needs identified&#13;
(including the report prepared for Phase I of this study).&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK: The project comprises the following components:&#13;
Phase I of the Project identified particular concerns at those diesel fired plants which were visited. Phase II of the&#13;
project therefore includes environmental audits of those ENDE diesel fired plants not visited during Phase I (i.e.&#13;
plant below 4 MW).&#13;
. A detailed evaluation of the specific environmental and social issues associated with the existing Transmission&#13;
facilities of the main interconnected system.&#13;
* A review of the most recent environmental policy activities of both the power sector and the Ministry of&#13;
Sustainable Development and Environment and development of recommendations for amendments to specific&#13;
items of draft Regulations. In addition, the study will develop a practical and cost-effective framework for the&#13;
implementation and enforcement of Bolivian environmental policy and legislation.&#13;
* The carrying out of urgent work on the three G's that was identified during Phase I of the project.&#13;
The TASKS to be undertaken are described below:&#13;
Task 1.       The Consultant will evaluate specific environmental, safety and social issues associated with any&#13;
ENDE diesel fired plant under 4 MW which is designated for capitalization (this plant was not subject to audit&#13;
during Phase I of the project).&#13;
Task 2.       The Consultant will evaluate specific environmental and social issues associated with the existing&#13;
Transmission facilities of the main interconnected system, and, if needed, provide economic and cost-effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
2 of 2&#13;
recommendations with prioritized mitigatory measures, estimated costs and schedules, all in the form of an Annex&#13;
to be part of the capitalization agreement of ENDE's Transmission system. The study should include, but not be&#13;
limited to: an assessment of the methods and guidelines used by ENDE in the transmission planning process, the&#13;
implementation and effectiveness of those methods; an inspection of major sub-stations and other transmission&#13;
facilities; a review of on-going procedures for the maintenance of transmission facilities (vegetation control, oil&#13;
changing etc.) and any measures taken to mitigate environmental and social effects.&#13;
Task 3.        There exists a growing body of secondary environmental legislation to both the Electricity and&#13;
Environment Laws in Bolivia and the Consultant should assess whether, given the institutional structure, the&#13;
legislation will be effective in environmental regulation of the power sector. The Consultant will work with the&#13;
Environmental Unit in ENDE and the Regulation Project for the Environment Law in the Ministry of Sustainable&#13;
Development and Environment.&#13;
Task 4.        This task will involve an assessment of the most appropriate mechanism for the enforcement of&#13;
environment policy in Bolivia taking into account economic, political, technical and environmental considerations.&#13;
The work should concentrate on the power sector but consider the implications for environmental regulation of all&#13;
sectors. Both short term and long term considerations should be examined.&#13;
The work will focus on permitting, compliance checking and enforcement. Amendments and additions to existing&#13;
draft regulations will be suggested in order to allocate legal powers and establish the framework which will ensure&#13;
effective permitting, compliance and enforcement in the regulatory system. The Consultant will collaborate with&#13;
the relevant personnel in the Secretariat of Energy and the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment.&#13;
Task 5.        In order to ensure that the potential for problems between power stations and neighbors is&#13;
minimized, it is essential that development in areas surrounding stations is planned and controlled. Potential for&#13;
improvements in the planning and enforcement system were identified by Phase I of the study. The Consultant will&#13;
therefore undertake a review of planning legislation and enforcement as it relates to the zoning of industrial,&#13;
commercial and residential development. The Consultant should examine the ways in which this legislation is&#13;
linked to specific requirements for developers to consider environmental issues and controls (noise etc.) regardless&#13;
of whether full environmental assessments are required on the basis of the study the Consultant will suggest&#13;
appropriate changes in legislation, policy and/or institutional arrangements.&#13;
Task 6.        The Consultant will undertake environmental noise surveys at the Guaracachi, Valie Hermoso,&#13;
Aranjuez and (subject to operational status) Villa Abaroa plants. The surveys should evaluate the significance of&#13;
noise levels with respect to nearby residents and recommend suitable remedial measures if appropriate.&#13;
Task 7.        Concerns were raised during Phase I of the project with respect to soil and groundwater&#13;
contamination caused by leakage and spillage of diesel fuel and lubricating oils at several plants. The Consultant&#13;
will therefore evaluate the nature and extent of soil and groundwater contamination at the Trinidad, Villa Abaroa&#13;
and Guaracachi plants and recommend appropriate short term and, if necessary, long term remedial measures for&#13;
the identified contamination&#13;
Task 8.        Phase I of the project identified the presence of likely asbestos containing materials at several&#13;
plants. The Consultant will therefore under separate private contracts assist private utilities to undertaking&#13;
asbestos surveys, including sampling and analysis, at the Trinidad, Aranjuez and Villa Abaroa plants in order to&#13;
confirm the presence, extent and condition of asbestos. Survey findings as well as an asbestos management plan&#13;
describing the recommended measures for managing each identified asbestos-containing material should be&#13;
presented along with cost estimates.&#13;
Task 9.        The Consultant will undertake a program of environmental awareness and audit training for&#13;
ENDE plant management.&#13;
LOCATION: This project will be undertaken in Bolivia.&#13;
