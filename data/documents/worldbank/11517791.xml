Setting up pro-poor units&#13;
to improve service delivery&#13;
Lessons from water utilities in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia&#13;
&#13;
This field note discusses proactive measures that utilities can take to serve the urban poor, particularly through the&#13;
establishment of dedicated pro-poor departments or units. Water service delivery to poor people living in Africa's&#13;
large cities requires this special approach due to unclear land tenure, unplanned layout, overcrowding and lack&#13;
of accurate data, among other challenges. Although water utility services should be at the center of water and&#13;
sanitation delivery, many utilities do not yet have the mandate, organizational structure, incentives, or skills to&#13;
adequately address these challenges.&#13;

&amp;#12;Summary&#13;
&#13;
The field note discusses how&#13;
to reorient water and sanitation&#13;
utilities to meet the needs of poor&#13;
people in large urban settlements. It&#13;
outlines the extent of the challenge&#13;
in sub-Saharan Africa where&#13;
enormous backlogs in service&#13;
provision are building up as urban&#13;
populations continue to grow at&#13;
an average of 5 per cent annually&#13;
(Kessides 2005).&#13;
&#13;
The approach taken here is that&#13;
water and sanitation utilities,&#13;
whether public or privately owned,&#13;
should be the primary drivers of&#13;
service provision to all segments of&#13;
the population. However, given the&#13;
fact that well over half of Africa's&#13;
urban residents are poor and&#13;
without access to affordable water&#13;
and sanitation services, utilities will&#13;
need to adapt their approach and&#13;
structure in order to viably supply&#13;
services to a significantly greater&#13;
percentage of poor urban residents.&#13;

The context                                  Figure 1. Water coverage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In sub-Saharan Africa most public and&#13;
privately owned water and sanitation&#13;
utilities in urban areas struggle to&#13;
serve their poor consumers. And&#13;
since poor urban residents make up&#13;
72 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's&#13;
urban population (UN Habitat 2003)&#13;
the challenge is acute. Clearly, an&#13;
approach that meets the service&#13;
needs of this huge and overlooked&#13;
group of consumers is urgently&#13;
needed.&#13;

In 2006 only 35 per cent of urban&#13;
residents in the region had a&#13;
household water connection (see&#13;
Figure 1). The sanitation situation (see     Figure 2. Sanitation coverage&#13;
Figure 2) is of even greater concern,&#13;
with the number of urban residents&#13;
using an unimproved source of&#13;
sanitation or defecating in the open&#13;
having increased from 59.6 million in&#13;
1990 to 76.6 million in 2006. With an&#13;
average urban population growth rate&#13;
of 5 per cent per year for Africa as a&#13;
whole (Kessides 2005), the demand&#13;
for both water and sanitation services&#13;
is growing steadily.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
Traditionally water and sanitation&#13;
utilities in Africa have not devoted&#13;
much attention to serving poor&#13;
people despite demographic trends&#13;
indicating that the growth rate of&#13;
urban dwellers is increasing, and&#13;
the fact that poor people can and&#13;
already do pay for services. It is clear&#13;
that African governments and the&#13;
utilities providing water and sanitation&#13;
services need to pay more attention&#13;
to serving their poor citizens.&#13;
&#13;
The four examples presented of pro-&#13;
poor units in eastern and southern&#13;
Africa operate in complicated social,&#13;
political and economic environments.&#13;
Nonetheless, they are clear examples&#13;
of utilities committing resources&#13;
and actively working with partners&#13;
to improve services to the poor.&#13;
These utilities are moving beyond&#13;
the purely technical towards a more&#13;
coordinated, city-wide approach.&#13;
&#13;
Setting up a dedicated pro-poor unit&#13;
is not an end in itself, it is a tool to&#13;
help utilities plan and implement&#13;
improved services to the poor on            Manual sludge exhausters in Mukuru slum (Nairobi)&#13;
both a strategic and programmatic&#13;
basis. Utilities and their pro-poor units&#13;
should be frequently evaluated to             Serving the Urban Poor&#13;
ensure progress towards to the end&#13;
                                              This series of field notes on Serving the Urban Poor aims to provide lessons&#13;
goal - access to more affordable and&#13;
                                              to public sector decision-makers, managers and implementers, and their&#13;
reliable water and sanitation services&#13;
                                              private partners, to tackle the challenges of service delivery to the urban&#13;
for the poor&#13;
                                              poor. The series is concerned with the key issues and actions necessary to&#13;
                                              improve the scale and rate of progress towards the MDGs in urban areas:&#13;
                                              making utility reform work for the poor; enhancing the role of local private&#13;
                                              providers; promoting incentive driven, predictable enabling environments;&#13;
                                              and strengthening consumer voice and mechanisms to improve the&#13;
                                              accountability of service providers.&#13;

            Setting up pro-poor units to improve
            service delivery : lessons from water utilities in Kenya,

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note discusses proactive
            measures that utilities can take to serve the urban poor,
            particularly through the establishment of dedicated pro-poor
            departments or units. Water service delivery to poor people
            living in Africa's large cities requires this special
            approach due to unclear land tenure, unplanned layout,
            overcrowding and lack of accurate data, among other
            challenges. Although water utility services should be at the
            center of water and sanitation delivery, many utilities do
            not yet have the mandate, organizational structure,
            incentives, or skills to adequately address these challenges.
