into play when the decision is whether to rebid a concession, because of the incentives for&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Should a conceding authority auction off
            or negotiate a contract for an exclusive private
            infrastructure deal? Advocates of negotiation often argue
            that a formal competition may take too much time, that the
            costs of preparing bids may be excessive, and that
            innovation may be discouraged. But proponents of competitive
            bidding argue that there are ways to address theses concerns
            without sacrificing the bidding process. Moreover, they
            argue, competition may yield a better deal for the conceding
            authority and enhance the transparency of the process,
            making the transaction more politically sustainable. This
            Note examines the arguments.
