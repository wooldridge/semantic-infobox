Background&#13;
Completion of the solid waste     The population of Peshawar, capital of the North West Frontier Province of&#13;

project to the CBO.               permanently, expanding and creating peri-urban slum settlements such as&#13;
Tehkal Payan (population 20,000). The municipal services, already over-&#13;
*   Demonstration effect, inspiring as  stretched and under-funded, simply gave way leaving residents to their own&#13;
well as imparting training, linkages,  devices for sanitation; resulting in unhygienic conditions.&#13;
and skills to other like-minded&#13;
communities and non-&#13;
governmental organizations.       Program           Initiation&#13;
In 1994, HRMDC (a local NGO) initiated its pilot program on urban solid waste&#13;

aerobic composting of organic     several surveys and evaluating community needs and levels of enthusiasm.&#13;

The program commenced in May&#13;

Area Identification &amp; Selection                                                   1994 -&#13;
Tehkal Payan was identified as the project area. A meeting was held with the community X A X&#13;
elders to familiarize them with the concept. A safai (cleanliness) day was held with the   /\&#13;
participation of the municipal corporation's administrator to raise awareness.&#13;
Program Implementation &#13;
Once households had been sufficiently motivated, the members were given two garbage  X&#13;
bags, dark blue for organic waste, and white for non-organic waste. Most of the waste  t 995 - &#13;
collected was organic as the inorganic junk was kept for its resale value by the household  1&gt; 1997 &#13;
members themselves. The bags were collected twice weekly by waste collectors and sent to Z1 t &#13;
the compost farm in the village of Regi. Waste was further sorted there by the waste collectors&#13;
to separate saleable junk (bottles, plastic, paper, tin, etc.) and ensure that only non-organic&#13;
waste was sold or disposed of in municipal dumps. A hujra committee of household members&#13;
was formed which collected the service charge of Rs 15 per month. All accounts of receipts&#13;
and expenditures were kept by the committee.&#13;
The organic waste is stored in pits and left covered for 4-6 weeks until composting is&#13;
complete. The first yield of compost was given free of cost to the landlord of the compost farm.&#13;
Subsequently compost was packed in 1 kg bags and sold forRs 15 ($ 0.4) per kg. The&#13;
income from the sale, which in 1997 amounted toRs 3,400 ($ 85), was ploughed back into the&#13;
program.&#13;
Follow up &amp; Support&#13;
Prior to handing over to the CBO, a Female Social Organizer (FSO) used to visit the area&#13;
three times a week on alternate days. The first day was spent on providing primary health an  1995.-&#13;
hygiene education to female members either individually or during group meetings. The  &gt;  1998&#13;
second day was spent in explaining how to separate the waste into organic and non-organic&#13;
components. Initial mistakes were corrected with the guidance of the FSO. The third day was&#13;
spent in supporting and monitoring the work of the community teacher.&#13;
Male, and from September 1997, female social organizers held weekly meetings with the&#13;
community to discuss progress, motivation and to facilitate the resolution of any problems.&#13;
Now that the project is in the hands of the community, it is the community members who hold&#13;
these meetings where project monitoring is also discussed. All minutes of the meetings and       4&#13;
proposed actions are recorded.&#13;
Handing Over to the Community Based Organization &#13;
In September 1997 the program was handed over to the Community Based Organization   tode V&#13;
(CBO). The CBO has organized regular monthly meetings for resolving problems andliaising&#13;
with town committee members. It has also made certain changes to the program.HRMDC's&#13;
social organizer still visits the area twice a week to monitor the program and provide support.&#13;
Replication m      Training   has a&#13;
In an effort to assist in replicating the solid waste management program, several orientation  1 195- &#13;
events have been organized for NGOs interested in replicating this program to provide an  I 998 &lt;&#13;
overview and an understanding of the implementation cycles. &#13;
Three NGO/CBOs have been provided with basic training and have visited the HRMDC site .  \&#13;

Sustainability                                         Lessons &amp;&#13;
Once the program had been handed over to the CBO,      Recommendations&#13;
major changes took place. Due to lack of adequate             The success of a program depends on it&#13;
financial resources, all but one of the six waste pickers     satisfactorily addressing the community's needs&#13;
were relieved of their duties, and the compost site was       while keeping running costs to within affordable&#13;

Thirteen months later, the sole scavenger left his job       the running costs to rise beyond the community's&#13;
reach. This hampers replication, and major&#13;

during this time the CBO looked for a replacement. A          operational changes have to be introduced after&#13;

The CBO formalized the contract with the participating&#13;
households, and increased the service fee to between      0   NGOs play an important role in initiating and&#13;
Rs.10 to Rs. 20. However, on average the CBO collects         demonstrating new concepts, providing technical'&#13;
Rs. 6 per households per month which is barely sufficient     knowledge, linkages with formal sectors, and&#13;
to pay the waste pickers' wages. The only alternative         training of others interested in replicating such&#13;
source of income is recycling and sale of compost and the     concepts.&#13;
potential for this is limited by the small scale of the project.&#13;
There is a need for research on low cost&#13;
The sustainability of the program therefore lies either in    composting in Pakistan. This program had to go&#13;

            The population of Peshawar, capital of
            the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, expanded
            significantly during the late 70s, reaching nearly one
            million due to the influx of Afghan war refugees. A large
            proportion settled permanently, expanding and creating
            peri-urban slum settlements such as Tehkal Payan (population
            20,000). The municipal services, already over-stretched and
            under-funded, simply gave way leaving residents to their own
            devices for sanitation; resulting in unhygienic conditions.
