&amp;#12;REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF&#13;
To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed to be internationally&#13;
competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff&#13;
salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if warranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by&#13;
private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries,&#13;
the Board approved an average increase in the salary structure of 3.32 percent for fiscal 2009, effective July 1, 2008, for Washington-based staff.&#13;
    The annual salaries (net of taxes) of executive management of the World Bank Group were as follows for the period July 1, 2008, through&#13;
June 30, 2009:&#13;

     Maina Gichohi uses a stretch of the Northern Corridor every day as           between Kenya and Uganda. Road improvements have also caused&#13;
     he drives into Nairobi for work and business. "Recent improve-               vehicle operating costs to fall.&#13;
     ments on this road have made the ride into the city so much easier           Maina works along the stretch of the Northern Corridor that runs&#13;
     and cheaper," he says. "It was a while in coming, but I am glad we           from Mombasa to Kampala. It is among the busiest in the region,&#13;
     are finally getting there!" Improvements on the corridor constitute          with 10 percent traffic growth per year, and is considered the&#13;
     a major objective of the Northern Corridor Transport Improvement             backbone of the Kenyan economy and its neighbors. Nearly&#13;

     Bank Group interventions involving East Africa's main trade corridors--      costs, improving access and trade conditions in coastal and&#13;

     institutional support to public and private stakeholders, and measures       4 million inhabitants of the Central African Republic and the 4 million to&#13;
     to facilitate trade activity. The NCTIP and the EATTFP have improved         5 million persons living in Northern Cameroon. Similarly, it will&#13;
     transactions at the Mombasa Port, reducing the movement of goods             diminish the in-port time at Cameroon's Douala port by 30 percent&#13;
     from arriving ships by more than 24 hours and cutting road transit           and lower transit times across that country to the Central African&#13;
     between Mombasa to Kigali and the time it takes to cross the border          Republic by 20 percent.&#13;

    Bangladesh faces similar energy sector problems. Manufacturers&#13;
surveyed in the Bank's most recent Investment Climate Assessment&#13;
estimate that power shortages reduce sales by about 12 percent a year. To&#13;
help address the problem, the Bank approved $350 million in fiscal 2009 for&#13;
the Siddhirganj Peaking Power Project, designed to increase reliable power&#13;
during periods of peak demand. The project builds on the Bank Group's&#13;
long history of involvement in Bangladesh's energy sector, including&#13;
support to the successful Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy&#13;
Development Program, which has helped bring power to hundreds of&#13;
thousands of consumers through grid connections and solar home&#13;
systems. And in Nepal, the Bank committed $89.2 million in response to the&#13;
country's unprecedented energy crisis, in which grid-based consumers&#13;
were supplied with electricity for only eight hours per day.&#13;

postcrisis period is by supporting client countries seeking to improve&#13;
their business and investment climate. Much progress has already&#13;
been made: for the fifth consecutive year, Europe and Central Asia led&#13;
world regions in reforms to business regulation. Between June 2007&#13;
and June 2008, 23 of the region's 25 countries implemented 62&#13;
reforms that make it easier to do business. Four of the 10 economies&#13;
making the most regulatory reforms are in Europe and Central&#13;

            The World Bank annual report 2009 : year in review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank group, among the
            world's largest development institutions, is a major
            source of financial and technical assistance to developing
            countries around the world. In fiscal 2009, the World Bank
            group sponsored 767 projects with a total commitment of
            $58.8 billion, distributed in credits, loans, grants, and
            guarantees. This fiscal year's funding marks a 54
            percent increase over the previous fiscal year and a record
            high for the Bank group. The Bank group's investment
            projects are aimed largely at improving infrastructure
            services associated with poverty reduction and enhanced
            growth. In fiscal 2009, the Bank group committed $20.7
            billion to infrastructure, a critical sector to provide the
            foundation for rapid recovery from the crisis and to support
            job creation. The sustainable infrastructure action plan,
            launched in July 2008, will leverage up to $72 billion to
            provide additional financing of up to $149 billion in public
            and private investments over fiscal 2009-11. The Bank
            group's investment projects are aimed largely at
            improving infrastructure services associated with poverty
            reduction and enhanced growth.
