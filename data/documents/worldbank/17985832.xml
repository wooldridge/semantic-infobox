&#13;
OLIVER:       Thank you for consenting to our conversation this morning.     a half years. I was later acting Program Director for West Africa.&#13;
&#13;
I wonder if I may begin by asking if you would say a bit about your          That makes for about 10 years of African experience.         After a stint&#13;
&#13;
background, bow you happened to come to the World Bank, and what you         at the Harvard Business School, I became Director of our European&#13;
&#13;
have done in general in the World Bank since you came?                       office in Paris for five years -- from July of ;78 to July of        ~83.&#13;
&#13;
STECia!Aii:    Well 1 thank you very much; it;a a pleasure to talk to you,   Ever since I have been Program Director of Latin America in charge of&#13;
&#13;
Professor, especially since you are writing about a person I very much       the western half of Central and South America.&#13;
&#13;
liked.                                                                       OLIVER:       You have had a very distinguished career.&#13;
&#13;
          I came to the Bank, October 5 1 1964, as a Young Professional.     STECKBAH:     A very varied career.&#13;
&#13;
I think that is significant. because it was a program that George Woods      OLIVER:       May we come back to the beginning and let me ask if you&#13;
&#13;
initiated to get young graduates from various countries without too          would say a bit about the origins of the Young Professionals program.&#13;
&#13;
much professional experience to join the Bank and to get their training      "I think that was started when Hr. Woods was President was it not 1&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank.     Aa a Young Professional. I worked firat in a project        STECKHAM:     That is very correct.     The idea was to provide an&#13;
&#13;
department, then in an area department -- The European Department. and       additional infusion of new staff, younger staff, to the institution. I&#13;
&#13;
I ended up in The Legal Department.      I'm a lawyer by training.   I bad   think the program started around 1963.        The Bank bad existed for&#13;
&#13;
spent about a year in the Legal Department when Mr. Woods offered me         almost 20 years and was mainly staffed by people who were mid-career&#13;
&#13;
the job of personal aasistant. becoming the auccessor of George              people when they joined the Bank.        I think the idea of the Young&#13;
&#13;
Wishart, who was his first personal assistant.      (He had met him in the   Professionals program, which was George      Woods~   idea, was also further&#13;
&#13;
Philippines.)     So I worked for George Woods for over two years and then   to diversify the staff -- that is, to get more nationals from a&#13;
&#13;
continued with Bob McNamara for another year and a couple of months.         greater variety of countries.         I believe this was one of George&#13;
&#13;
          ln â&#128;¢Y career in the lank after leaving the president's             Woods~    greatest achievements:   to make the World Bank a truly&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  3                                                                           4&#13;

international institution, not only borrowing from more capital                     with the Ford Foundation a&amp; a practicing lawyer in Hanover,&#13;
&#13;
markets than the u. S. capital market, which was the only national                  Germany.    It was also fascinating because then General Counsel, Ronnie&#13;
market available after World War II, but alao through the recruitment               Broches, was a very stimulating person and a very close advisor to&#13;
&#13;
of staff fro. developing and non-U.S.         non-D.~.   industrial countries.      George Woods.   But 1 would rather talk about the Woods; years, because&#13;
&#13;
OLIVI!I&lt;:      I have been told that Mr. Richard Demuth also bad a band in          the Legal Department was only for one year of 21 years that I have now&#13;
thinking through the idea of the Young Professionals program.            Can you    spent in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
shed light on that?                                                                 OLIVI!I&lt;:   Just one laet question about the Young Professionals.      I&#13;
&#13;
STECKUAN:      Very aucb so.     I believe Demuth vas one of the founding           think it is true, is it not, that a very substantial number of the&#13;
fathers under George Woods of this prograa.          Dick Demutkheaded what 1       senior people in the Bank today are people who came through the Young&#13;
would call the ''Think Tank." of the Bank at the time.          lie vas a sponsor   Professionals program?&#13;
&#13;
of many innovative ideas.                                                           STECKHAN:   That is very true.   We now see three vice presidents in&#13;
OLIVER:        But it clearly started after Mr. Woods became President?             Kim Jaycox, Vice President for East Africa, Wilfred Thalwitz, Vice&#13;
STECKHAN:      That is correct.                                                     President for West Africa, and Joe Wood, Vice President, Financial&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:        It vas designed not only to bring bright young people into the       Policies, who are graduates of the Young Professionals program; and&#13;
&#13;
Bank but to make the staff aore international than it bad been.                     there are a couple of directors who are graduates.&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:      Very much so.     I think   your research will show, if you look     'OLIVER:    One of the characteristics of the program was that the&#13;
&#13;
at the share of U. K. - u. S. - Canadian citizens versus non U. K. -                person involved bad an opportunity to work in several different&#13;
&#13;
U.S.- Canadian citizens, that changed quite dramatically during the Woods           assignments.&#13;
&#13;
years.      You will also see that George Woods elevated some promising Part        STECKHAN:   Very much so.   The principal of rotating staff every five&#13;
&#13;
II developing country nationals.                                                    or seven years so that you internalize the comparative advantage of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER         Ia there anything significant about the year or so when you          the World Bank which is to be world wide was a principle of the Young&#13;
&#13;
were in the Legal Department that you would like to talk about before               Professionals program. Maybe one should say that, in addition to youth&#13;
&#13;
we talk about your work with George Woods?                                          and internationalization. a third purpose of the Young Professionals&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:      Not really.     For me to work in the Legal Department was           program was to help breed a new group of managers.&#13;
&#13;
exciting. It was my second job as a lawyer.          I had previously worked        OLIVER:     Let us come to your work with Hr. Woods.   How did it happen&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 5                                                                                    6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that you as a young professional bad the opportunity of working                          not a secretary in.&#13;
&#13;
closely with the President of the Bank?                                                  STECIHAN:     Ho.    In those days the job involved a number of things:&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:     I guess George Woods wanted to be consistent.           One of the         looking at Board documents, reading them for the President, marking&#13;
&#13;
traditions bad been that the Bank not only      ~ould   have a   u.    S.                them up, and occasionally commenting on them.       George Woods, who would&#13;
&#13;
President but also a 0. K. or a    u. s.    personal assistant to the                    read every report to the Board, liked somebody (his personal&#13;
&#13;
President.    George Wishart's predecessors were from the u. s. (One may                 assistant) to look at these first and point out certain things.         That&#13;
&#13;
have been froa the u. X.) George Woods wanted to open up that job--                      was   o~   part.    The second was to handle the mail and the written&#13;
&#13;
to internationalize it.     I don't know how many candidates there were,                 communications of the Bank.      Whatever came to the President's office,&#13;
but I do know that bow it happened is a slightly funny story.                            I would decide what to do with it:       send it to George Woods to send it&#13;
&#13;
          George Woods, who was occasionally an iapatient person, wanted                 to others for comments with instructions and then watch over the&#13;
to talk to my then supervisor, Ronnie Brochea, and couldn't reach him                    follow-ups, or draft an answer myself.      Letters addressed to the&#13;
until he found out he was in Cyprus.        (Ronnie Brocbea later told me                President got answered either through the President himself or on his&#13;
the story.)    Woods called up Ronnie Brocbes and said, "I bear you have                 behalf by staff that I would pick.&#13;
&#13;
this guy Steckhan there, what type of a fellow is he?"           Broches                            A third task was to look occasionally at drafts of speeches&#13;
launched into a long description of my weaknesses and strengths. and                     George Woods was supposed to make.      He fussed a lot about his speeches&#13;
&#13;
Woods cut him off after awhile and said,      Â·~y   question really is:            Can   -- as many presidents do.      He wanted to be sure that this vas his&#13;
&#13;
he keep his mouth abut?"     I guess that    the answer vas, "Yes.          11&#13;
                                                                                 As a    personal message.       I would comment on his drafts, for there were&#13;
&#13;
lawyer one tends to be discrete.     I'a sure I wasn't selected only on                  certain personal matters that be used to discuss with his personal&#13;
&#13;
that ground. but it is a funny and true story.                                           assistant trying to get an independent, uninterested view.       Then there&#13;
&#13;
          What happened then vas that I worked alongside George Wishart                  were some confidential tasks, things George Woods did not want to&#13;
&#13;
for a number of months, sharing an office, which was a very useful and                   assign to anybody but his personal assistant.&#13;
&#13;
effective way of getting into a job which is largely undefined and                              Another job was traveling with the President, preparing his&#13;
&#13;
needs definition both through the person of the President and his                        trips, organizing, keeping minutes.      Keeping minutes could almost be a&#13;
&#13;
needs and through the person of his personal assistant.                                  separate activity in the sense that, at the time George Woods created&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Would you say a bit about the job itself?       You were clearly            the President's Council, which is now the Managing Committee, it met,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  7                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I believe, every Monday aorning in bia office.          His personal assistant   not every morning.    Of course. when we bad Board days. Tuesdays&#13;
&#13;
would keep minutes and keep track of things that were discussed and              usually. there would be a meeting prior to that.     There were other&#13;
&#13;

STECKHAN:     I have no idea what happened to them.       I purposefully         STECIBAH:    I think Woods was sometimes perceived as a loner in&#13;
&#13;
didn't keep copies of them for m,aelf, nor did I keep a record of my             decision making. which I would say is not a fair statement.      At the&#13;
&#13;
activities with George Woods.      I thought it vas too personal and             President's Council meetings (this is now back 18 years or so), Woods&#13;
&#13;
confidential a relationship to keep too many traces.            Not that there   gave everybody a chance to talk about his area.     I think it did&#13;
&#13;
was anything illegal, but I don't know what happened to them.            They    influence Woods' judgment and helped him make decisions.       Woods could&#13;

should be around the Bank.                                                       be very harsh with people. but I think it was his way of testing them.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      I'll ask someone in the President's office who may very             People were able to talk back to him. disagree with him.       I've seen&#13;
&#13;
well know.     In the Archives they seem not to be aware of any minutes.         occasions when a senior official of the Bank disagreed with Woods, and&#13;
&#13;
so it is possible they are simply kept by the President himself.                 Woods would say. '"You are totally wrong." and the next day Woods would&#13;
&#13;
STECKUAH:    That's quite poaeible.                                              call him up and say. '"You may have a point i I think you are right."&#13;

the President of the Bank and the Executive Directors.        Maybe you       Charter.&#13;

would expand on that and then say a bit about Woods' particular               OLIVER:       Do you believe that they really do follow this requirement?&#13;

relations with his Board.                                                     STECKHAH:     They follow it mostly. but there are clear cases&#13;

&#13;
their Boards were quite different. They were usually composed of              the President baa avoided is to have the Board split along North-South&#13;
&#13;
people appointed by the President (I am talking about First Boston's          linea.     The President baa been able to keep discussions at the&#13;

STECKHAN:     Peter Lieftink, you are quite right, ia another old timer:     everyti~     the replenishment comes around.     The Board did get involved&#13;

The first or second Finance Minister of free Holland after World War         in this.     Maybe it got more involved in the Woods' years in the&#13;

          Another feature is that some of the Executive Directors,           much for India and Pakistan, which were the major recipients.          That&#13;

especially the French and the British, are also Executive Directors of       was an important negotiation because major shareholders -- the U. S.&#13;

STECKBAN:     Very aucb so, and you will find, I'm sure, the press                  certainly one of ay lasting U.preaaiona.        You could also say it is&#13;
&#13;
reviews of that in some recorda.                                                    quite a surprising impression, because when you first met Woods be was&#13;
&#13;
OLIYI!II.:    Speaking of the Pearaon Coamiaaion Report, do you happen to           very quiet, but once you had a business relationship, you could also&#13;
&#13;
remember whether Pearson waa Woods first      cbo~ce   to bead that                 say be was a fighter.      That was one part.&#13;
&#13;
Commission?    This is a bit of an aside.                                                      I was impressed bow a commercial banker      an investment&#13;
&#13;
STECIQIAII:     I believe he val.    Woods must have known him.       He was a      banker, a bard nosed, Wall Street type -- got into the human aspects&#13;
&#13;
former Prime Minister of Canada -- I guess a war-time Prime Minister,               of development.     Woods started the first educatiDn project that was&#13;
&#13;
and you certainly know that Woods in the war vas a Colonel in                       considered a soft project. Woods didn't start the World Bank lending&#13;
&#13;
Washington. So maybe there had been some personal relationships during              to agriculture, but he certainly felt this was a high priority, and so&#13;
&#13;
the war. Woods knew very .uch who Â·he was.                                          I think the key human element in development was something that be&#13;
&#13;
OLIYI!II.:    Let us turn now to some of your own personal recollections.           fully supported.      It vas also interesting to note that he probably had&#13;
&#13;
What do you care to say about George Woods and Mrs. Woods and your                  bad no exposure, or very little, to Africa in his previous job.         He&#13;
&#13;
relationship with thea both here in Washington and also in your                     bad had a lot of exposure to Latin America, I believe. and some to&#13;
&#13;
travels?                                                                            Aaia.&#13;
&#13;
STECIBAN:     Well, there are a couple of points.       Firat, Woods must           OLIVER:       To India.&#13;
&#13;
have bad a very tough youth and a very tough fight up hill getting to               STECKHAN:     India, .you're quite right; he was a consultant for the&#13;
&#13;
where he did get as the president of the largest investment bank in                 World Bank to India before he came. Hia experience in Africa must have&#13;
&#13;
the world.     I think some of this urge to fight and     ~pose h~aelf        and   been virtually zero, but he did have a special interest in Africa.           He&#13;
&#13;
to get somewhere did show in his appearance.       Woods was a fighter, but         had some    s~ple   feelings.   One was for these emerging nations -- to&#13;
&#13;
I think it wae only appearance; to me and to many others he was a very              say in each one of these nations there must be one resource that is&#13;
&#13;
kind and coneiderate person.        I have seen him on many occasions with          evident that we should help develop as a first step.        The Mauratania&#13;
&#13;
his friends, whether they were people from completely outside, eay,                 Mining Project was a good example.      There are others.   There is the&#13;
&#13;
John North, the bead of Ringling Brothers, or then Deputy Prime                     Zambia Dam:     Kariba, hydro power, mineral resources. plantation loans&#13;
&#13;
MinisterÂ· Morarji Desai of India, who was a personal friend.           With         that we made to Cameroon.       I think it was a very simple idea, but a&#13;
&#13;
others he could be a very kind and warm, considerate person. That ia                very correct idea for a first step in a relationship with emerging&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             19                                                                         20&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     Would you g'.le88 that his interest in finding a resource        rate, which determines bow much you have to devote to public and&#13;
which could be developed was related in some sense to the famous             private consuaption rather than investment, is particularly high,&#13;
&#13;
economic Law of Coaparative Advantage, or     wa~   it a more general sort   excessively high, in Africa as compared even to Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
of businessman's feeling that you do the things in teras of orders of        Finally, in agriculture, you will find an enormous number of micro-&#13;

&#13;
STECKIWI:    1 would think it waa common sense, a feeling of doing           diversified research to see what grows where and under what conditions.&#13;
&#13;
things in an orderly fashion baaed on priorities rather than any             That research has not always been done.&#13;

motivation by some economic theory.                                                    Maybe the last point is the relationship of Africa to the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You, yourself, have spent a fair amouUt of your career           outside world.    It is much closer to the old Colonial powers. since&#13;
&#13;
dealing with Africa.     Ia it fair to characterize African countries as     independence is so recent and these colonial powers have so much&#13;
&#13;
a whole as being somehow different -- I am now talking of course about       influenced Africa -- in leadership's way of living and working.        You&#13;
&#13;
Africa South of the Sahara -- from Asia or Latin America?                    cannot say this for Asians or Latins.     You cannot link East Asia as&#13;
&#13;
STECKIWI:    Yea.    Firat, they are newer.   All African countries with     much to Holland or to England as you can link the present way of life&#13;
&#13;
two exceptions, Ethiopia and Liberia, acquired their independence in         of African leadership to France or to the U. K.      That's changing of&#13;
&#13;
the early '60s.     Second, the artificial boundariea of the eeparate        cburse.&#13;
&#13;
tribeâ&#128;¢ of nations are much .ore aeverly felt in Africa than in Latin         OLIVE&amp;:      Did Mr. Woods perceive these things that you have been&#13;
&#13;
America, where boundaries were drawn artificially 170 to 180 years           talking about?    Would you say a word in general about what Hr. Woods&#13;
&#13;
ago.   Third, while you will find some very sophisticated, experienced       did personally to help bring the African countries into the Bank, so&#13;
&#13;
Africans, you don't find enough of them, ao there is an enormous             to apeak?&#13;
&#13;
amount of training and institution building that needs to be done.           STECKIWI:     Well, be did encourage African countries to join the World&#13;
&#13;
That ia not the case in East Asia or Latin America.                          Bank.     He wanted to move fast, and, since we had an insufficient&#13;
&#13;
          Fourth, while Africa has a lot of resources -- water, power,       data base of knowledge, we wanted to do the obvious things first.        I&#13;
&#13;
fiaberiea, aineral resources, their exploitation is much less evident        believe it was George Woods who set up two regional offices: Ivory&#13;

OLIVER:          The one you worked in was in Nairobi?                            to keep closely in touch with our major money centers.         That obviously&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:        In Nairobi.    He felt that we had to do much .ore work in       vas Wall Street for a long time, but be helped to open up the European&#13;

preparing projects, helping coordinate miniatriea, and understanding              markets, Germany in particular.         He vent to Arab countries for that&#13;
&#13;
Africa than we had to do in other continents.' You ba~e to check the              purpose. In fact my first visit with bUD was to Kuwait.           That was one&#13;
&#13;
record, but I am pretty sure be waa the man vbo set up these aiaaiona.            concern.&#13;
&#13;
He helped Africans in the Bank. I believe it vaa under him that we                           The other concern was to get to know major client countries&#13;
&#13;
hired an African former ._aiatant Director General UNESCO or lAO, I               well.     You Eentioned Ghana.    Some of the projects in Ghana were major&#13;
&#13;
aa not sure which, who caae to the IFC: Acloll&amp;kob.          Aa I believe I       projects.     Hkrumah was a world figure, and Woods went to Ethiopia and&#13;
&#13;
indicated before, Woods promoted quite a few Asians in the Bank --                Kenya for obvious reasons.       What be liked in these visits was to apeak&#13;
&#13;
just making the point that the Bank bad to becoae more international.             to the heads of state, to have direct rapport with some of these&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:        Bow about Mr.   Woods~   travels.   Did be travel a good deal in   leaders, which he did have.        I have been with him to India, Pakistan&#13;

Africa'l                                                                          and Kuwait, and it was quite obvious, especially in India and&#13;
&#13;
STECICIIAN :      I cannot answer that fully. I think be travelled before my      Pakistan, that his advice was directly sought by the heads of state.&#13;
&#13;
time to Ethiopia and to Kenya.           Re auat have been to West Africa, and    I went with him to the Annual Meeting in Brazil. (Pointing to&#13;
&#13;
be certainly travelled to North Africa -- he vas close to the King of             photograph)     You may recognize some people.      To the right is Pierre&#13;

OLIVER.:         I think be must have been in Ghana at one point.                 Minister in Brazil:      Delfim Neto.     The man to the left is George&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:         You are quite right.                                            Woods.     The man in the middle is now Prime Minister of Norway.               This&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER.:         I beard a good story about his .eeting with Nkrumha.             man is Mr. Costo Blanca,Â· then military dictator of Brazil.             This is&#13;
&#13;
STECICIIAN:       You are quite right.      That's before my time.                the site of the Annual Meeting.         The other pictures are:        oh yea. here&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:         What can you say in general about Woods' travels?          You    you have       look at this.     Are you interested?&#13;
&#13;
accompanied bUD on his travels.            What aorta of things were              OLIVER:       Sure.&#13;
&#13;
accomplished?        What can you tell about the pattern of travel?               STECICIIAN:     This is the George Woods Board. You can see to his right&#13;
&#13;
STECIQWI:         It vas pretty much George Woods himself who decided when        Mort Mendel&amp; and the General Counsel.         Then Ayub. the Pakistani E.D.,&#13;

     sitting there.       The Treasurer, Bob Csvanugh, sits there.       This is Dr.      that.      Woods' concern with Africa was not always highlighted.         I think&#13;
&#13;
     Donner, the Geraan B.D. at the time.        This is Escobar, who became              there vas an interest that Woods bad despite his appearance and&#13;

     Finance Minister of Cbilei he was an Ezecutive Director at the time.                 background as a tough banker:           the human aide of Woods.   Those are&#13;
&#13;
     This is a Spaniard, who later becaae a       Minis~er   in Spain.      This man is   soae of the key things.&#13;
&#13;
     Canadian.      This is Kochaan, about whom I told you.       This is Dr.             OLIVEJ&lt;:         Did Woods bold grudges if he was short with somebody&#13;
&#13;
     Lieftink.      This is Ren6 Larre.    I'm not sure who these are.        This man    because of a momentary disagreeaent?&#13;
&#13;
     is a Scandia.vian.       This man is, I think, Stone's predecessor,                  STECICIIAII:     It varied, it varied.     There were examples of people that&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVEJ&lt;:       An Australian.                                                        be felt be didn't get along with, but there were other examples. Peter&#13;
&#13;
     STECICIIAII:   And you see Burke Knapp, who is always to his left.           Tboae   Cargill was ODe of those.        Peter Cargill would just say,      Â·~ou're&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     two were always sitting here.        Here is the Secretary's Department.             wrong, 11 occasionally. I'm not sure whether Woods liked it or not, but&#13;
&#13;
     This is Shoab, foraer Finance Minister of Pakistan, who became an                    he would come back and say. "Peter, maybe you were right on this one,"&#13;
&#13;
     Executive Director.       You will have seen bia n. .e.                              which I think requires quite a lot.&#13;

     OLIVER:         He also was on the Bank staff for a time, waa be not?                OLIVEJ&lt;:         I was once told that there was someone in the Paris office&#13;
&#13;
     STECKHAN:      Well, be is here as a vice president.         He vas in charge of     of the Bank for a time whom Woods did not like -- the name was never&#13;
&#13;
     IDA for awhile.                                                                      aentioned, and that when Woods went to Paris, he tried to avoid going&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVEJ&lt;:        Very interesting.                                                    'into the office on that account.&#13;

     STECXHAN:       I   don't know whether you will have pictures in your book.          STBCIHAH:       You should ask George Wishart.      It doesn't ring a bell.&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVEB.:        That would be a good one to have.                                    The man who was in the Paris office was Miller.           Johnnie Miller, who&#13;
&#13;
     STECICIIAII:   Woods' concern vaa to have a more international bank.                 baa long since died, vas a very well-known media man and, I think, a&#13;
&#13;
     Woods' concern was to turn the Bank into a development institution.                  Woods appointee.       My   ~pression   was that Woods bad a lot of time for&#13;
&#13;
     Examples:      agriculture and education.                                            Johnnie Miller.&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVEB.:        Did Woods use that phrase himself, "Development                      OLIVER:         The story was probably wrong, or I got it wrong.&#13;

&#13;
     STECKHAN:       I'm not sure.    I don't think that was part of the jargon           office.        It may be somebody else.     1 cannot see Johnny Killer as the&#13;
&#13;
     at the time.        It may have been "Development   Ban~."   but I can check         person.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              25                                                                                  26&#13;

&#13;
trips, did abe not?       And abe, herself, played an iaportant role in             Minister.     She had organized a luncheon in his honor.   She was the top&#13;
&#13;
the social activities of the wives of the Bank.        Would you say                person of the largest member country of the World Bank.       This must&#13;

received regularly the wives of all new staff ae.bers, which nov is                 got a little nervous, but Mrs. Woods was there and she said, "Don't&#13;
&#13;
iapo1aible to do, but vas possible at that time.       She vas quite close          worry." Finally we bought the akin.     It was very late, and we got in&#13;
&#13;
to some of the wives George Woods saw on hia trips, and I think abe                 the car and went to what I thought was the house where the luncheon&#13;
&#13;
had a major influence on him in these trips -- a calaing influence.                 was to be held, but it turned out to be the wrong bouse.       By the time&#13;
&#13;
Be discussed a lot of things with her.      Be val already a man who had            George Woods got to this very important personal and professional&#13;
&#13;
had one very serious operation when he came to the Bank.           I don't know     luncheon, be vas about 40 minutes late, I must aay, and he never,&#13;
&#13;
exactly wbat it vas, but he had to watch his health.        It wasn't a             never, uttered a harsh word about it,     which I think contradicts a lot&#13;
&#13;
bypass.                                                                             of   ~pression&amp;   you will gather about him as a harsh and severe person.&#13;
&#13;
OLIYEJI:    Be had a heart attack in 'S4, and be bad an aneurism in '63.            He bad another side.    Be realized   we all make mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAH:   Yea, when be vas at the Bank.                                           OLIVER:    Quite right. I think that is a very good story with which to&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Shortly after he came.     You are quite right.                         end our converaation.    Thank you very much for your courtesy this&#13;
&#13;
STECDAR:    I think be bad a pace uker or sa.ething.                                morning.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, is there something I should have asked you and haven't            STECKHAN: It is a pleasure.&#13;
&#13;
asked you about these years?&#13;
&#13;
STECKHAN:   Ho,   e~ept   just a very personal note.   For me the years&#13;
&#13;
with Woods and then with McNamara were probably the most fascinating&#13;
&#13;
of my life, and that is largely due to the personality of Woods.             I'll&#13;
&#13;
tell you a funny but true story to conclude.      On Woods' last visit to&#13;
