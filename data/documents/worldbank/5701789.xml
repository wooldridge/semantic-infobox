Decentralization of rural water and sanitation services&#13;

New roles for rural water associations&#13;
and boards in Honduras&#13;
&#13;
With a new move towards decentralizing water and sanitation services in Honduras, municipalities,&#13;
community water boards and associations of users need to have the capacity to fulfill their obligation&#13;
in developing community participation and demand to provide high quality services. This field note&#13;
presents examples of several initiatives of communities, municipalities, the central government, NGOs&#13;
and international aid agencies to promote the organization of rural communities and associations of&#13;
water users in Honduras.&#13;

            Decentralization of rural water and
            sanitation services: new roles for rural water associations
            and boards in Honduras
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As in most Latin American countries, the
            water and sanitation sector of Honduras is going through a
            decentralization process that induces profound changes. New
            regulatory, technical, planning and political authorities
            are being created and existing ones overhauled. While the
            objective has been to create an environment where higher
            quality services can be delivered by more responsive actors,
            alternatives for small towns and rural areas have not
            received the same attention in reforms as the larger cities.
            It is clear from experiences in both developed and
            developing countries that organizing rural users with
            representative local water boards and joining these local
            boards into water users associations can provide essential
            elements for mutual support and sustainability of quality services.
