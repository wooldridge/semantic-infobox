&amp;#12;&#13;
L BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    Civil War in Tajikistan&#13;
I.    Tajikistan is the poorest CIS country, with a 1996 per capita income of US$ 330. Of the&#13;
country's 5.8 million inhabitants about 70 percent live in rural areas. Only some seven percent of the&#13;
country's 143,000 square kilometers are arable, while the rest consists of mountainous areas.&#13;
Agriculture contributes to about 25 percent of GDP and 50 percent of employment. Tajikistan's main&#13;
agricultural products are cotton, (which generates about 50 percent of total agricultural production),&#13;
vegetables, grains and livestock. The industrial sector accounts for 35 percent of GDP but only for 15&#13;
percent of employment. It groups a total of approximately 7,000 state-owned enterprises. Under the&#13;
Soviet regime, the easy availability of hydroelectric power greatly influenced the pattern and structure of&#13;
this sector and led to the development of aluminum, chemicals and other energy-intensive industries.&#13;
2.    Tajikistan became an independent country in 1991 as a result of the breakup of the Former&#13;
Soviet Union. Civil war in started in May 1992 as different regional and political groups struggled for a&#13;
redistribution of power after the collapse of the Soviet system. The armed conflict continued for the next&#13;
four years with varying intensity, major fighting being concentrated between 1992 and 1993. An&#13;
estimated 50,000 people lost their lives, 600,000 people were displaced inside the country and some&#13;
60,000 fled to neighboring Afghanistan. Probably as many as half a million people emigrated to other&#13;
CIS countries for pnimarily economic reasons, among them a great number of professionals and skilled&#13;
workers. While during the first two years the heaviest fighting and physical destruction took place in the&#13;
south of the country (Khatlon region) and in areas that remained under the control of the Government, in&#13;
subsequent years hostilities moved to the center-east of the country (Karategin and Tavildara valleys), an&#13;
area controlled by the forces of United Tajik Opposition (UTO).&#13;
3.    The war had a severe impact on the whole country as it compounded the effects of the breakup of&#13;
the former Soviet Union (which resulted in cutting off trade links and stopping budget transfers that&#13;
amounted to up to 40 percent of GDP), bringing most economic activities to a standstill plunging a large&#13;
portion of the population into poverty. GDP is estimated to have declined by about 50 percent during the&#13;
first half of the 1990s. Increases in military expenditures reduced resources for other more productive or&#13;
social sectors. The years of the civil war in Tajikistan also saw the emergence of a number of armed&#13;
gangs and paramilitary groups. These groups, which have repeatedly taken hostage Tajik personalities&#13;
and personnel of international organizations, constitute a serious threat to security and political stability.&#13;
B.    The June 1997 Peace Agreement&#13;
4.    A complex and protracted negotiation process between the Government of Tajikistan and UTO&#13;
began in 1994 with the signing of a first cear-fire in Teheran and culminated in the signing, in Moscow&#13;
on June 27, 1997, of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in&#13;
Tajikistan. The Peace Agreement lays the foundation for peace in the country and calls for a transitional&#13;
period of twelve to eighteen months during which the provisions of the agreement are to be further&#13;
defined and implemented. The principal authority for monitoring the implementation of the agreement is&#13;
the Commission for National Reconciliation (CNR) chaired by Mr. Said Abdullo Nuri, the leader of the&#13;
UTO, and is composed of twenty-six members, half of whom were nominated by the Government and&#13;
half by the UTO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
5.    The Government's strategy for implementation of the Peace Agreement rests on action programs&#13;
for the following areas:&#13;
Political Reconciliation and Democratization: Political parties, outlawed in 1993 are being legalized&#13;
and parliamentary elections are expected to be held in 1998. A Government reshuffling under which a&#13;
number of ministerial positions would be given to the opposition is under discussion.&#13;
Repatriation and Reintegration of Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees: With the assistance&#13;
of the agencies of the UN system, a major effort is being made to complete the voluntary repatriation of all&#13;
refugees at the earliest possible date.&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration of Ex-Combatants: An estimated 5,000 to 7,000 UTO ex-&#13;
combatants are being demobilized and provided assistance to help them engage in civilian activities or&#13;
being integrated into the Government army. Concurrently, the Tajikistan armed forces will be restructured&#13;
and reduced by about thirty percent.&#13;
Relief. Reconstruction and Development: Assisted by the donor community, the Government's&#13;
relief and reconstruction efforts will focus on three phases: (a) a program of immediate relief and food aid&#13;
to allow the most severely affected populations to go through the winter and resume agricultural activities in&#13;
Spring 1998; (b) a short-term program of reconstruction of the most essential economic and social services;&#13;
and (c) a medium- and longer-term reconstruction and economic redevelopment program that will support&#13;
the Government's strive for macro-economic stability, structural reform and resumption of growth&#13;
C.    War Damages in the Karategin and Tavildara Valley Area&#13;
6.    The Karategin and Tavildara valleys have together a total population of approximately 250,000&#13;
people and cover an area of approximately 200 square kilometers, 90% of which is mountainous.&#13;
Administratively the area is divided into the five rayons of Darband, Gharm, Jirgital, Tavildara and&#13;
Tojikobad. The valleys occupy a key strategic position as they effectively control the roads that link&#13;
Dushanbe with the eastern part of the country, particularly the Autonomous Oblast of Gorno-Badakshan&#13;
(GBAO), as well as with the Kyrgyz Republic. The area is fertile, has good agricultural potential and,&#13;
during the Soviet era, was a net exporter of agricultural products (particularly potatoes, fruit and dairy&#13;
products).&#13;
7.    The Government and UTO fought for the control of the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area since&#13;
1992. The last open fighting occurred in December 1996. As part of the peace negotiation process,&#13;
(para 4), a cease fire agreement was signed in January 1997 but left the area under the military control of&#13;
the UTO forces. Because it was controlled by the opposition, the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area&#13;
remained cut off from the rest of the country for a several years and, unlike the other conflict areas in the&#13;
south of the Tajikistan, received no support from the Government. It also obtained very little help from&#13;
the international community with the exception of assistance provided by the United Nations Office for&#13;
Project Services (UNOPS), the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), and a German NGO (German Agro&#13;
Action). Even in the absence of open fighting, the continuing state of war and insecurity as well as the&#13;
lack of monetary resources prevented any regular maintenance and repair work for infrastructure and&#13;
community facilities. The deterioration of the transport conditions, in particular, effectively cut off the&#13;
local communities from their traditional urban markets for vegetables, fruit and dairy products in other&#13;
parts of the country and forced them to revert to subsistence farming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
8.    A preliminary assessment of reconstruction needs and an initial consultation with stakeholders&#13;
was conducted in the five rayons in September/October 1997 by the World Bank and the United Nations&#13;
Office for Project Services (UNOPS), in collaboration with local authorities. A summary of this&#13;
assessment in Annex 1. The damage to the Karategin Valley is as much in the radical decline in&#13;
economic activity, especially in the growing and marketing of agricultural products, as it is in physical&#13;
deterioration of infrastructure and the loss of social services. The assessment focused on identifying&#13;
those needs that will have an important impact on peoples' lives during the next two years, rather than on&#13;
a restoration of the complete physical and social infrastructure as it was before the civil war. On this&#13;
basis, the assessment identified almost US$ 24 million in physical rehabilitation costs including US$ 5.3&#13;
million in transport infrastructure, US$ 7.2 million in shelter, US$ 5.3 million in power and&#13;
telecommunications, US$ 3.6 million in education and health, US$ 1.6 million in agriculture and US$&#13;
0.6 in industries. The assessment showed that reconstruction priorities are very different among the five&#13;
rayons and even within the rayons, suggesting that project design should respond to very local&#13;
requirements and be flexible.&#13;
9.    The consultation process also revealed a number of important concerns. People at the local level&#13;
want to be involved in the preparation and implementation of reconstruction programs and to have a&#13;
transparent system of monitoring and evaluating their impact. The top priority for people is to create&#13;
opportunities for income and employment generation, initially through agriculture and public works&#13;
projects. Obtaining essential inputs for the 1998 agricultural year is especially important. In addition,&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction of certain bridges and roads were identified as essential to breaking the&#13;
isolation from markets, especially for marketing of crops and livestock, that the area suffered during the&#13;
war period. The provision of basic health and education services was also identified by people as having&#13;
high priority. The damage to shelter, although significant in terms of monetary loss, was seen as a lesser&#13;
priority because it affects only a small proportion of the population (about six percent) who, in a majority&#13;
of cases, have started repair and reconstruction work on their own.&#13;
IH.    INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE&#13;
10.   Since 1993 over US$ 180 million have been contributed by the international coinmunity to&#13;
emergency aid for Tajikistan. The largest part of this assistance has consisted of food aid, which even&#13;
today is distributed to over 10 percent of the popuilation. It has also covered medical support, in particular&#13;
assistance to contain outbreaks of typhoid fever, as well as emergency reconstruction of shelter, and other&#13;
needs. In addition to the major UN Agencies (UNDP, UNHCR, WFP, FAO, UNDHA, WHO,&#13;
UNICEF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of the Red&#13;
Cross (IFRC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM and many international NGOs have&#13;
been active in the country, including the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), Save-the-Children-US (SCF-US),&#13;
Save-the-Children-UK (SCF-UK), Mercy Corps International (MCI), Relief International (RI), Shelter&#13;
Now International (SNI), CARITAS, and others.&#13;
11.   On November 14, 1997 the UN Security Council extended and expanded the mandate of the&#13;
United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), which was established in December 1994.&#13;
The main role of UNMOT is to assist the Government and the UTO in the implementation of the peace&#13;
process and, in particular, to cooperate with the CNR in the preparation of elections, monitor the&#13;
disarmement and demobilization of UTO fighters, investigate cease-fire violations and ensure an effective&#13;
cooperation with CIS Peacekeeping Forces, the Russian Border Forces and the Mission of the&#13;
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
12.   Both the World Bank and the IMF participated in a task force which, under the aegis of the UN&#13;
Special Representative of the Secretary General, assisted the Government and the opposition in the&#13;
preparation of the document International Support to Peace and Reconciliation in Tajikistan. This&#13;
document, which identified an estimated US$ 65 million of priority financing requirements for the&#13;
transition phase of the General Agreement, for the four areas of the Government's strategy for the&#13;
implementation of the Peace Agreement, (para. 5), was the basis for discussion for a Donors Conference&#13;
recently held in Vienna, Austria on November 24-25, 1997. The conference raised US$ 56.5 million in&#13;
pledges. In addition to pledges of specific support to the peace process the Conference also raised&#13;
numerous tentative pledges beyond the timeframe of the transition period as well as humanitarian&#13;
assistance and rehabilitation. The Bank participated actively in the Conference and presented its post-&#13;
conflict portfolio for Tajikistan.&#13;
13.   A Post-Conflict Emergency Assistance operation has been prepared by the Fund presented to its&#13;
Board on December 22, 1997. Further support by the international donors community will be provided&#13;
through a Consultative Group (CG) meeting which is planned to be held Paris in May 1998 and will&#13;
address the needs for Tajikistan's medium- and longer term reconstruction and economic redevelopment&#13;
included in the Government's strategy for the implementation of the peace agreement.&#13;
Hi. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A.    World Bank Strategy and Programs in Tajikistan&#13;
13.   At the request of the Government, a World Bank mission visited Tajikistan in September 1997 to&#13;
identify the outline of a possible assistance program. In response to the Government's concerns, the&#13;
World Bank decided to prepare two operations: (a) the Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Credit of an amount&#13;
of US$ 10 million equivalent which will help the Government address immediate general budgetary&#13;
needs associated with the implementation of the peace agreement and was presented to the Board on&#13;
December 16, 1997; and (b) the Post-Conflict Emergency Reconstruction Project (PCERP) which will&#13;
address the specific reconstruction needs of the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area in order to help with its&#13;
reintegration into the national economy.&#13;
14.   The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tajikistan was discussed by the Board&#13;
on May 16, 1996. Recognizing the risks associated with the political and economic instability in&#13;
Tajikistan, the CAS calls for a flexible approach to the Bank Group's assistance program until. The CAS&#13;
aims at arresting the intensification of poverty through measures designed to foster a supply response,&#13;
based on employment intensive growth with direct steps to protect the most vulnerable groups. The&#13;
broad elements of the strategy are to: (a) strengthen institutional capacity to plan and implement a&#13;
medium-term program of structural reform; (b) support the Government's efforts to stabilize the&#13;
economy; and (c) moderate the impact of the economic collapse on vulnerable groups. PCERP is&#13;
consistent with the CAS and puts emphasis on a flexible approach to the conditions in Tajikistan. A&#13;
new CAS is planned for Board discussion in June 1998 and will articulate the Bank's medium-term&#13;
strategy in the new political environment.&#13;
B.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA experience&#13;
15.   The Bank's experience in working in Tajikistan is still relatively limited and too recent to allow&#13;
to draw specific lessons that are relevant for an emergency operation. The Bank has, however, a large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
experience with emergency reconstruction projects in other parts of the world, with a significant share of&#13;
resources committed to post-conflict operations. A Policy Framework for World Bank Involvement in&#13;
Post-Conflict Operations was prepared in 1997. OED is currently assessing the Bank's experience with&#13;
post-conflict reconstruction. The study reviews the experience in the overall Bank portfolio and discusses&#13;
lessons learned in nine countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, El Salvador, Eritrea, Haiti,&#13;
Lebanon, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka.) Preliminary findings indicate that successful implementation of&#13;
reconstruction projects include: (a) early bank involvement in defining a post-conflict reconstruction&#13;
strategy; (b) a good assessment of damages and needs; (c) an active Bank role in post-conflict aid&#13;
coordination; (d) flexible and expeditious programming, design and implementation processing; (e) a&#13;
willingness to help local authorities with project preparation; (f) diversification of reconstruction&#13;
programming into various sectors; and (f) the use of pilot projects in community-based activities and in&#13;
programs to support local initiatives. Additional preliminary findings of the study are that effective&#13;
assistance to post-conflict reconstruction is management and staff intensive and that it requires a&#13;
proactive involvement of senior management in key decisions, a strong commitment by country directors&#13;
and teams and resident missions with adequate staffing and delegation authority.&#13;
C.    Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
16.   The most recent CAS for Tajikistan, which was discussed by the Board on May 16, 1996,&#13;
recognizes the risks associated with operations in Tajikistan and urges a flexible response to the needs&#13;
of the country. The Peace Agreement between the UTO and the Govermnent represents an important&#13;
opportunity for establishing an environment that is conducive to macro-economic stabilization,&#13;
structural reform and increased growth. Both the Government and the UTO have indicated the&#13;
importance of beginning the reconciliation and reconstruction processes as quickly as possible. Not&#13;
only are these processes important for their tangible results, but also for their psychological value to a&#13;
war-weary population. The proposed operation, which is the second of two post-conflict IDA&#13;
operations for Tajikistan in FY 98, is therefore an effort to respond to some of the immediate needs of&#13;
the country and contribute to the successful implementation of the peace process. PCERP supports the&#13;
reconstruction needs in area of the country severely affected by the war and most neglected by&#13;
reconstruction efforts. Although other donors are active in Tajikistan and IDA's efforts are part of a&#13;
broader program, no other major donors are involved in this specially important geographical area. The&#13;
leadership provided by IDA is considered essential to the success of the peace process by both the&#13;
Government and the donor community.&#13;
D.    Relationship with other Bank/IDA-financed Projects&#13;
17.   PCERP complements IDA's support to the peace process in Tajikistan initiated by the Post-&#13;
Conflict Rehabilitation Credit which will be presented to the Board on December 16, 1997, and which is&#13;
designed to help the Government reduce arrears for the social safety net and finance expenditure for the&#13;
immediate-term resettlement of refugees and the demobilization of ex-combatants which are critical&#13;
elements in the Government's strategy for the implementation of the Peace Agreement. PCERP is also&#13;
closely related with the Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP), (Cr. 29640-TJ) which was presented to&#13;
the Board in April 1997. PPAP finances, among other activities, various NGO-executed shelter&#13;
reconstruction programs in the south of the country as well as an agricultural support program&#13;
implemented by AKF in GBAO. PCERP draws extensively on the PPAP experience for the design of its&#13;
implementation arrangements.&#13;
&#13;

IV. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.    Project Preparation&#13;
18.   PCERP has been prepared as an emergency operation in accordance with the instructions of&#13;
OP/BP 8.50 on the basis of the findings of an identification mission which visited Tajikistan in&#13;
September 1997 and the results of the needs assessment undertaken by the Bank and UNOPS in&#13;
September and October 1997, (pam. 8 and Annex I). Appraisal was carried out in November 1997.&#13;
Negotiations were held in Washington on December 22, 1997&#13;
B.    Project Objectives and Design&#13;
19.   The primary objective of PCERP is to support the Government's strategy for the successful&#13;
implementation of the Peace Agreement (para. 5) by facilitating the reintegration of the Karategin-&#13;
Tavildara Valley area - which has remained under the control of the opposition longer than any other&#13;
part of the country - into the national economy through a targeted program of short-term reconstruction&#13;
of physical and social infrastructure, and emergency support to agricultural development.&#13;
20.   To support the above objective the project has been prepared on the basis of a close consultation&#13;
of the population of the Karategin-Tavildara Valley through a needs assessment carried out in&#13;
September-October 1997. The project has also been prepared seeking a great simplicity and flexibility in&#13;
its design in order to ensure, in a context of severe and extensive resource constraints, a fast and efficient&#13;
implementation. The operation complements IDA's support to the peace process in Tajikistan initiated by&#13;
the Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Credit which has been presented to the Board on December 16, 1997, and&#13;
will help the Government reduce arrears for the social safety net and finance expenditure for the immediate-&#13;
term resettlement of refugees and the demobilization of ex-combatants which are critical elements in the&#13;
Government's strategy for the implementation of the peace agreements. It also complements, and is closely&#13;
coordinated with, the efforts undertaken by the donor community in other parts of Tajikistan. The project is&#13;
expected to be completed by March 31, 2000 with a Credit Closing Date of September 30, 2000.&#13;
C.    Project Components&#13;
21.   PCERP - the implementation of which will begin in Spring 1998 and last two years - will include&#13;
the following: (a) Agicultual Support for the 1998 Spring planting season; (b) repair, rehabilitation, and&#13;
reconstruction of Bridges and Roads; (c) repair and rehabilitation of schools, health care centers and&#13;
other community facilities as well as implementation of other programs of Small Commumit Works&#13;
benefiting local communities; and (d) Other snfratructure Works in the power and agriculture sectors.&#13;
C.l   Con ent 1:  icultural Supp    (6% of base cost)&#13;
22.   The component will finance the purchase and distribution of wheat seeds (150 tons), potato seeds&#13;
(650 tons), and fertilizer (660 tons) for the 1998 Spring planting season in the Darband, Gharm, Jirgital&#13;
Tavildara, and Tojikobad rayons. The implementation of the component will be managed by the Aga&#13;
Khan Foundation (AKF), (pam. 36) and allow for the cultivation of a total of about 900 has during the&#13;
Spring and Winter planting periods of 1998. The seeds to be provided consist of varieties hat have been&#13;
tested in Tajikistan, have shown good performance, and are certified by the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
Fertilizer will include amophos, seleter and potassium chloride. Inputs will be distributed exclusively to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
about 550 private farmers within the framework of land privatization agreements between AKF and the&#13;
local authorities.&#13;
C.2   Component 2: Bridges and Roads (51% of base cost)&#13;
23.   The component will finance: (a) the rehabilitation, repair, or reconstruction of about fifteen&#13;
bridges in the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area and the Kalayhumb rayon of the GBAO; and (b) the&#13;
completion a new by-pass road for the town of Darband to replace the existing non functional road.&#13;
Twelve of the fifteen bridges are on the main roads (M41 and A372) linking Dushanbe with the GBAO&#13;
or the Kyrgyz Republic, respectively) while the other three link the main road to local communities. All&#13;
bridges, which are of either single concrete slab or suspension type with total spans varying between 20&#13;
and 90 meters, and roads will be repaired or rebuilt by two State enterprises, which operate under the&#13;
oversight of the Ministry of Transportation and Road Administration (MOTRA) and are specialized, one,&#13;
in construction of bridges and the other one, in that of roads. Works will be implemented on the basis of&#13;
standard MOTRA engineering designs, construction quality norms, and execution procedures, (para. 37).&#13;
C.3   CoMpoen 3: Small Community Works (23% of base cost&#13;
24.   The component will finance: (a) the rehabilitation or repair of schools, health care facilities,&#13;
other community facilities as well as small-scale transport and agricultural infrastructure of local&#13;
economic interest, all of which will be identified, and agreed upon by, the local communities concerned;&#13;
and (b) the provision of essential equipment and supplies to allow facilities repaired or rehabilitated to&#13;
resume normal operations. Under the oversight of an NGO hired as Implementation Manager, the works&#13;
will be carried out by local small- and medium-size enterprises in close consultation and cooperation&#13;
with the beneficiary local communities Specific selection criteria for works and implementation&#13;
arrangements are outlined in para. 38 below and Annex 4.&#13;
C.4   Component 4: Other Infrastructure works (20 % of base cost)&#13;
25.   The component will finance a series of works in the agriculture sector (rehabilitation of rural&#13;
roads, bridges, irrigation systems) and in the power sector (transmission lines, transformer stations) for&#13;
which additional technical preparation studies are required prior to the implementation of these works.&#13;
26.   Project Management: As a result of the civil war, the Tajildstan Government's capacity to&#13;
effectively prepare and implernent projects which are of the magnitude of the proposed operation and&#13;
involve external donors is extremly reduced. To allow for a rapid start up of project activities, maintain&#13;
adequate control over quality of execution, and ensure timely delivery of works, goods, and services,&#13;
technical assistance (about 60 person/month of foreign and 180 person/month of local consultants) for the&#13;
two-year period of implementation is being sought, under parallel grant financing, from bilateral sources.&#13;
Discussions to this effect with the Canadian International Development Agency (CEDA) and the Japan&#13;
PHERD Fund for PNt-Conflict Operations are in progress.&#13;
D.    Project Cost ad Finandcg Plan&#13;

28.    All costs have been estimated in US Dollars due to the difficulties in forecasting exchange rates&#13;
for the local currency. Estimates for the civil works of both the 'Roads and Bridges' and the 'Small&#13;
Community Works' components are based on detailed assessments of materials and labor requirements&#13;
including transport cost to the sites and cost-comparisons with similar projects recently carried out in&#13;
Tajikistan by IDA's Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project (Cr. 29460-TJ) or other aid agencies. Estimates&#13;
for the 'Agricultural Support' component are based on a proposal submitted by AKF.&#13;
29.    The foreign exchange component of US$ 6.9 million equivalent represents 63 % of total project&#13;
cost. The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: (a) goods for 'Agricultural Support'&#13;
component: 50%; (b) civil works for 'Bridges and Roads' and 'Other Infrastructure Works': 80 %; (c)&#13;
civil works for 'Small Community Works': 20%; (d) goods for 'Small Community Works' component:&#13;
90%. Given the short implementation period of about two years no financial contingencies have been&#13;
applied. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10%. Project costs include an estimated US$ 0.2&#13;
million equivalent in taxes and duties on civil works and locally procured goods. Goods specifically&#13;
imported for the project will be exempted from custom duties and taxes. Labor and in-kind contributions&#13;
by local communities have not been included.&#13;
D.2    Project Financing:&#13;
30.    The IDA Credit of US$ 10.0 million equivalent will finance 91% of total project cost (100% of&#13;
the foreign exchange component and 76% of the local cost component). The Government contribution of&#13;
US$ 1.0 million equivalent will finance taxes and duties (US$ 0.2 million equivalent), and salary costs&#13;
for the State enterprises executing the works included in the 'Bridges and 'Roads' component, (US$ 0.8&#13;
million equivalent). The project will include retroactive financing of up to US$ 800,000 equivalent for&#13;
the purchase of agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizer) and bridge repair materials prior to Credit&#13;
Effectiveness, (para. 36 and 41).&#13;

E.     Economic Justification&#13;
31.    The main objective of the PCERP is to support the reintegration of the Karategin-Tavildara&#13;
Valley area into the national economy through repair and reconstruction of essential infrastructure and&#13;
emergency assistance to agriculture. Aside from contributing to peace and future political stability of&#13;
Tajikistan, the main economic benefit of the project will, through the restoration of satisfactory transport&#13;
conditions, consist in providing the local farming communities renewed access to their traditional&#13;
markets for agricultural products thereby helping these communities to extract themselves from the&#13;
subsistence farming economy into which they were forced by the conflict. Introduction of new high&#13;
quality seeds for wheat and potato will contribute to significant improvements in yields and therefore to&#13;
rural household incomes. Restoration or improvement of operating conditions of schools and health&#13;
care facilities will have significant positive effects on the efficiency of education and yield extensive&#13;
public health benefits. Additionally, through the implementation of the small community works by local&#13;
private small- and medium-size enterprises, the project will create a significant number of, albeit&#13;
temporary, jobs and help stimulate the development of the local enterprise sector At this stage, however,&#13;
given the absence of reliable statistical data on current conditions for all sectors in area emerging from a&#13;
protracted war it is not possible nor meaningful to estimate an overall Economic Rate of Return for the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
F.     Environmental Impact&#13;
32.    The project will have a limited environmental impact given the nature and size of the works&#13;
funded by it and has been classified as "B" for the purposes of OD 4.01. The project will focus on the&#13;
repair, rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of existing infrastructure or facilities. It will not raise any&#13;
resettlement or property rights issues and will be executed within the premises of the existing facilities or&#13;
the rights of way of the existing public roads network. Fertilizer under the 'Agriculture Support'&#13;
component will be distributed and its use closely monitored by AKF following the procedures agreed&#13;
with IDA for the PPAP project. AKF has a long-standing commitment to socially and environmentally&#13;
sustainable development and has extensive experience in agricultural development in fragile mountain&#13;
areas. Wheat and potato seeds imported under the 'Agricultural Support' component are of varieties that&#13;
are used extensively in the region. These varieties have been thoroughly tested, have proved their&#13;
adaptability, and are certified by the Tajikistan Ministry of Agriculture. All imports will be carried out&#13;
in accordance with national and international phyto-sanitary standards. The possible impact of works or&#13;
activities included in the 'Roads and Bridges', 'Small Community Works' and 'Other Infrastructure&#13;
Works' components will be reviewed on a case by case basis and, if required, will be subject to prior&#13;
environmental impact assessment as a condition for approval .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
V.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Organization and Management&#13;
33.   The project will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which has been created&#13;
in the Office of the Prime Minister for the management of both the Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Credit&#13;
(presented to the Board on December 16, 1997) and the PCERP . The Director of the PCU will report&#13;
directly to the Prime Minister and has been appointed with the approval of the CNR. Maintenance of the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) by December 31. 1997 was agreed during negotiations. (para. 57 (a).&#13;
34.   Within the PCU, a specific Unit will be created for the management of the Post-Conflict&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Project (PCERP). The PCU/PCERP Unit will be managed by an Executive&#13;
Director of Tajik nationality recruited on a competitive basis. He will be assisted by a team of foreign&#13;
and local experts funded under bilateral grant funding currently under discussion, (para. 26). The&#13;
PCU/PCRP Unit will be provided by the Government with an annual budget sufficient to cover regular&#13;
operating costs such as rental of office space, utilities, salaries of auxiliary personnel and other&#13;
miscellaneous expenses.  Specific Terms of Reference and organizational arrangements for the&#13;
PCU/PCERP are included in Annex 3. To facilitate the implementation of the project, the PCU/PCERP&#13;
will, in consultation with IDA, prepare an Operations' Manual , which will provide the necessary&#13;
guidelines for the management, including procurement, of the project. A tentative Implementation Plan&#13;
is included in Annex 5.&#13;
B.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
35.   Under the oversight of the PCU Director, the PCU/PCRP Unit will be specifically responsible&#13;
for: (a) overall management of the proposed project, including the coordination of project activities with&#13;
ministries and other government agencies, local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and&#13;
international donor agencies; (b) procurement of works and goods financed under the project; (c)&#13;
supervision and quality control of execution of works and delivery of goods; (d) management of project&#13;
accounts including credit withdrawals and disbursements from the Special Account; (e) monitoring of&#13;
the implementation performance of contractors as well as seeking continuos feedback from beneficiaries&#13;
on adequacy of project response to needs; and (f) assisting the Government as well as local authorities in&#13;
adequately informing the population about the project and its different features, (para. 47 and 54; and&#13;
Annexes 3a.3b,). Implementation arrangements for the different project components will be as follows:&#13;
B.l  CQ onent: Agricultural Support:&#13;
36.   To ensure the availability and satisfactory distribution of seeds and fertilizer in the Karategin-&#13;
Tavildara area for the Spring 1998 planting season, the implementation of this component will be&#13;
contracted, under a sole source contract arrangement, by the PCU/PCERP to AKF. AKF, which since&#13;
1992 has been successfully implementing an agricultural reform program in GBAO and is implementing&#13;
agency for part of IDA's PPAP project, has recently expanded its activities into the Karategin-Tavildara&#13;
Valley area. Under its agricultural reform program it enters into agreements with local authorities,&#13;
collective farms, and individual farmers of the five rayons. Under these agreements, land (between one&#13;
and four has) belonging currently under control of collective farms is being handed over to individual&#13;
farmers with an ownership guarantee given by the local authorities together with inputs and technical&#13;
assistance (from its own resources) provided by AKF. Currently, AKF has cooperation agreements with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
about 240 farmers owning around 400 has, but expects to increase the number to about 550 in Spring&#13;
1998 with about 1,200 has under cultivation. Under its contract with the PCU/PCERP, AKF will&#13;
purchase seeds and fertilizer, ensure appropriate and timely transport to the Karategin-Tavildara Valley&#13;
area, and carry out distribution to beneficiaries. It would also provide subsequent technical assistance to&#13;
the beneficiaries and closely monitor the adequate use of both seeds and fertilizer. Farmers benefiting&#13;
from AKF assistance would reimburse the latter in kind, that is, primarily in seeds in accordance with a&#13;
schedule included in the individual cooperation agreements with AKF. All seeds so collected will be&#13;
redistributed to other farmers newly entering into cooperation agreements.&#13;
B.2   Component: Roads and Bridges:&#13;
37.   The works included in the 'Roads and Bridges' component will be executed under a contractual&#13;
arrangement between the PCU/PCERP and the two State enterprises (MOST-STROI and DOR STROI),&#13;
which operate under the oversight of MOTRA and are the only two existing enterprises in Tajikistan&#13;
specialized, the first, in construction of bridges, and the second, in road construction. Under the&#13;
proposed arrangement, PCU/PCERP will procure all materials required for the works and funded through&#13;
the project on the basis of design studies (including environmental review) and bills of quantities&#13;
approved by MOTRA and following procurement procedures specified in a PCU/PCERP Operations'&#13;
Manual prepared in consultation with, and agreed upon by, IDA. MOST-STROI and DOR-STROI will&#13;
provide the necessary specialized personnel from their workforce, ensure the transport of both personnel&#13;
and materials from Dushanbe to the worksites, and execute the works in accordance with the quality&#13;
standards, timetable, and payment schedule agreed on in the contract.&#13;
B.3   Component: Small Community Works:&#13;
38.   Since (a) the execution of these works requires a strong and continuous participation of local&#13;
communities; and (b) the works are of small size and scattered location, a direct management of&#13;
implementation by the PCU/PCERP would not be practical. Instead, the PCU/PCERP will contract, on a&#13;
competitive basis, one or several NGO or other entities acceptable to the Bank to act, under the&#13;
supervision of the PCU/PCERP and the relevant line ministries (Ministry of Education, Ministry of&#13;
Health, etc..), as the local Implementation Managers in the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area. In this&#13;
quality, the Implementation Managers will be responsible for: (a) identifying, in close consultation with&#13;
the local authorities and the population of the communities concerned, the works to be executed or&#13;
equipment and supplies to be purchased satisfying agreed selection criteria (Annex 4); (b) obtaining, if&#13;
needed, approval from the PCU/PCERP on project management decisions in accordance with conditions&#13;
stipulated in the contract; (c) preparing technical designs (including environmental review), bills of&#13;
quantities, and tender documents; (d) organizing procurement among local small enterprises; (d)&#13;
evaluating tenders and preparing contracts; (e) supervising the execution of works and/o delivery and/or&#13;
installation of equipment and supplies; and (f) making payments to contractors and/or suppliers. All&#13;
procurement of specific goods or services required for the component (other than in-situ available&#13;
construction materials) will be carried out by the PCU/PCERP following the procedures specified in the&#13;
PCU/PCERP Operations' Manual.&#13;
B.4   Component: Other Infrastructure Works:&#13;
39.   The implementation arrangements for this components will follow, depending on the nature and&#13;
size of the works or goods to be provided, the arrangements for the 'Bridges and Roads' component or&#13;
the 'Small Community Works' component and will be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
C.      Mid-Term Review&#13;
40.    In addition to intensive regular supervision by Bank staff and close follow up by the Bank Field&#13;
Office in Tajikistan, IDA and the Government will carry out by end of November 1998 a mid-term&#13;
review to (a) assess progress in project implementation achieved until then; (b) identify constraints and&#13;
obstacles encountered; (c) discuss solutions and possibly required adjustments in the implementation of&#13;
ongoing components; and (d) agree on the completion program for the rest of the project. Subsequent&#13;
periodic reviews will take place according to a mutually agreed schedule but in no case no later than&#13;
November 1999. Agreement on mid-term review and monitoring procedures was reached during&#13;
negotiations. (para. 57(c)).&#13;
D.      Procurement&#13;
41.    The project will include retroactive financing of goods. Credit proceeds up to US$ 800,000&#13;
(8% of project cost) will be applied to expenditures for such contracts concluded after December 1,&#13;
1997. Only those contracts which will meet the Bank's procurement requirements outlined in this&#13;
section will be acceptable under retroactive financing. Procurement arrangements were discussed and&#13;
agreed at negotiations. (para. 57(b)).&#13;
42.    All goods and works to be financed from the credit proceeds will be procured in accordance&#13;
with the IDA Guidelines for Procurement ('Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits' published in January 1995 and revised in January 1996), including amendments as of the credit&#13;
signing date, using the Bank/IDA standard procurement documents. A procurement workshop will be&#13;
held in Spring-1998.&#13;

43.   Works: Bridges and Roads Component: The persistence of security problems in Tajikistan and&#13;
the scattered and remote location of the worksites requires an innovative approach to procurement. Due&#13;
to the civil war in which the country was engulfed for the last six years no major infrastructure works&#13;
have been carried out for several years. Therefore, ICB is not expected to be suitable. This is also&#13;
necessary as the size of the contracts is small (below US$ 200,000 equivalent). Also, there are no&#13;
private sector enterprises in the country that have the capacity to carry out the works required under the&#13;
project and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) is, therefore, not feasible either. Currently, there are&#13;
only two semi-autonomous State enterprises capable of carrying out the works, MOST-STROI and DOR-&#13;
STROI, which are specialized, the first in bridge constructions, and the second, in road construction, and&#13;
have the equipment and skilled personnel that is needed. Therefore, construction works with the help of&#13;
those companies is the only possible approach. In order to have an optimal solution, under the proposed&#13;
arrangement, all construction materials will be procured by the PCU/PCERP directly in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA, (para. 44). PCU/PCERP will procure the execution of the works through&#13;
up to about twelve individual Direct Contracts with MOST-STROI (of an average value of US$ 110,000)&#13;
and one contract with DOR-STROI (of a value of US$ 450,000), on a sole-source basis for a total value of&#13;
about US$ 1.5 million equivalent. Under these contracts MOST-STROI and DOR-STROI would provide&#13;
the specialized personnel and equipment required to execute the works under the control of PCU/PCERP&#13;
and technical supervision by MOTRA (if additional construction equipment is needed it would be leased&#13;
by PCU/PCERP), (para. 37). Payments to MOST-STROI and DOR-STROI would be made according to&#13;
a completion rates and time schedule included in their respective contracts with PCU/PCERP.&#13;
44.    Small Works Component: The works included in this component are scattered in a region&#13;
where there is no large-scale construction industry. Therefore, small community work projects of a&#13;
maximum cost of US$ 50,000 equivalent will be procured under Minor Works Contracts awarded under&#13;
lumpsum, fixed price contracts on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors in response to written invitations. Awards will be made to the contractor who offers the&#13;
lowest price quotation for the required work and who has the experience and resources available to&#13;
complete the contract successfully. Approximately US$ 2.0 million will be procured in accordance with&#13;
this procedure. The present approach shall be defined in the PCU/PCERP Operations' Manual. Given the&#13;
relatively large number of minor works contracts, and for information dissemination purposes, the&#13;
Implementation Manager will ensure that contracts opportunities are advertised for each six-month period&#13;
on a rolling basis for contractors' expressions of interest. The advertisements will be placed in local&#13;
newspapers or circulated through other media. The Implementation Manager will prepare and maintain a&#13;
list of interested contractors and will invite all such contractors to submit quotations. The list will remain&#13;
open so that any contractor expressing interest any time is added to the list. Direct Contracting (DC) will&#13;
be used for small works contracts under US$ 10,000 equivalent up to total value of US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent when because of the remoteness of the worksite, only one contractor is available. Contract&#13;
costs will be established by the Implementation Manager, in consultation with PCU/PCERP, on the basis&#13;
of cost comparisons with, and/or unit costs derived from, other similar contracts.&#13;
45.   Goods: Considering the emergency situation in the country and the need to expedite project&#13;
implementation, goods to be financed from the IDA credit consisting of construction materials readily&#13;
available from local suppliers in the country such as sand, gravel, crush stone, etc.. will be procured for&#13;
contracts valued at less than US$ 250,000 equivalent and an aggregate amount of up to US$ 3.1 million&#13;
equivalent through National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Goods consisting of miscellaneous supplies&#13;
included in the 'Small Community Works' component, and costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 200,000 equivalent, will be procured through National&#13;
Shippnig (NS) procedures on the basis of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers.&#13;

46.   Rak Prior Review. All contracts awarded under NCB and IS of a value in excess of USS&#13;
100,000 equivalent and contract awarded under DC of a value above US$ 10,000 equivalent will be&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. Additionally, the first two contracts for procurement under IS and NS&#13;
will be submitted to prior review inTespective of their value. All other procurement documents and&#13;
contract. will be subject to ex-post reviews by IDA supervision missions. Mechanisms for prior review&#13;
of Minor Works contracts with a value not exceeding US$ 50,000 equivalent will be described in the&#13;
PCU/PCERP Operations' Manual, (para. 34).&#13;
47.                        :  Procurement will be carefully monitored by the PCU/PCERP which&#13;
will set up to this effect a computerized monitoring system. All procurement documentation will be kept&#13;
at the PCU/PCERP office in order to be available for review by Bank supervision missions and exten&#13;
auditors. Quarterly reports will provide detailed information on procurement.&#13;
E.    Dsbursements&#13;
48.   The IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed in two and a half years, including six months for the&#13;
finalization of accounts and submission of final withdrawal applications and other reports.&#13;

50.   To facilitate timely project implementation the Government will establish, maintain, and operate&#13;
under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special account in US Dollars with an authorized allocation&#13;
of US$ 500,000 in a commercial bank that meets the requirements. During the early stages of project&#13;
implementation, the initial allocation of the Special account will be limited to US$ 200,000. However,&#13;
when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit will have reached the level of SDR 700,00&#13;
equivalent, the initial allocation may be increased to the authorized allocation of US$ 500,000 by&#13;
submitting the relevant applications for withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted&#13;
every three months and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting&#13;
documents.&#13;
51.   Disbursements for all contracts for works and goods of amounts of less than US$ 100,000 will be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Payment conditions and modalities for&#13;
disbursements under the 'Small Community Works' component will be stated in the respective&#13;
contractual agreements with the Implementation Managers for the component. Disbursements will be&#13;
made on the basis of SOEs. Records of the Special Account proceeds and outlays will be available for&#13;
review by Bank supervision missions and subject to annual audit. Modalities of Special Account&#13;
management and disburse ent arements were discussed and agreed during negotiations, (pam.&#13;
i-7(d)).&#13;
F.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
52.   The PCU will be responsible for the overall financial management of the project and will, to that&#13;
effect, establish within PCU/PCERP an accounting system acceptable to the Bank, with technical&#13;
assistance as required. The PCU will be subject to annual external audit by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Accounting and auditing arranents were agreed on during negotiations&#13;
(nara. 57(a.&#13;
G.    Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
53.   The PCU/PCERP will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Bank according to an agreed&#13;
format. The reports will summarize the status of implementation of the different project components in&#13;
terms of procurement, work execution, and disbursement. A final Implementation Completion Report&#13;
(ICR) will be prepared by the Government no later than six months after the Closing Date of the Credit&#13;
of September 30, 2000.&#13;
54.   Performance monitoring indicators will be used to monitor the achievement of the project&#13;
objectives, (para 57(g)). The indicators (Annex 6) reflect the concerns of the Government and IDA to&#13;
that the project provide a fast and adequate response to the needs of the population of the Karategin-&#13;
Tavildara Valley area. The monitoring of the indicators will also help to detect at an early stage possible&#13;
shortcomings in the project design and implementation arrangements and allow to quickly take remedial&#13;
action, if necessary. Agreement on reportiWng procedures was reached during negotiations. (para. 57(c)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
55.   The major benefits of the project are: (a) the provision to the inhabitants of the Karategin-&#13;
Tavildara Valley area of renewed and satisfactory access to the rest of the country thereby allowing the&#13;
redevelopment of the local economy especially in the agricultural sector and contributing to the&#13;
reduction of poverty; (b) the restoration and improvement of education and health services to acceptable&#13;
quality levels; and (c) increased incomes for farmers as a result of expansion of land privatization and&#13;
introduction of new quality seeds. Additionally, through the implementation of the small community&#13;
works by local private small- and medium-size enterprises, the project will create a significant number&#13;
of, albeit temporary, jobs and help stimulate the development of the local enterprise sector.&#13;
56. The project faces considerable risks, many of which cannot be avoided. These risks fall into two broad&#13;
categories: (a) Political risks: Despite a promising start, the continuing successful implementation of the&#13;
peace agreement remains a fragile enterprise. The demobilization of soldiers and their reintegration into&#13;
civil life in the context of Tajikistan's economy constitutes a formidable challenge and its favorable&#13;
completion could be jeopardized by a variety of factors. Political risks are difficult to manage, but the&#13;
provision of budgetary support under the Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Credit to help the Govemment bear&#13;
some of the costs of the peace process can be expected to contribute to bolstering political stability. (b)&#13;
Managerial and technical risks: Effective and timely implementation of the project requires the early&#13;
creation of the PCUIPCERP, including the appointment of key staff. The capacity of the local contracting&#13;
industry is not known at this point, and contracting bottlenecks could delay implementation. The diversion&#13;
of credit resources to other uses is an additional risk. The risks are minimized by (a) the simplicity of the&#13;
design of the project focusing on a few key components, (b) the relatively unsophisticated nature of the&#13;
works to be carried out, (c) the provision of technical assistance as early as possible in the implementation&#13;
process, and (d) the involvement of NGOs that already have experience in the management of this type of&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation works in Tajikistan. Placing the project under the responsibility of the&#13;
Prime Minister and having its implementation closely monitored by the CNR should help ensure the&#13;
appropriate use of funds and minimize the risks of diversion.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
57.   During Negotiations agreement on the following points was obtained:&#13;
(a)    Maintenance of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), (para. 33);&#13;
(b)    Procurement arrangements, (para. 41);&#13;
(c)    Mid-term review, monitoring and reporting procedures, ( para. 40 and 54);&#13;
(d)    Special Account and disbursement management arrangements, (para. 51); and&#13;
(e)    Accounting and auditing arrangements, (para. 52).&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
POST-CONFLICT EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
POST-CONFLICT NEEDS ASSESSMENT of KARATEGIN -TAVILDARA VALLEY,&#13;
Summary&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Tajikistan's civil war damaged agriculture, education, health institutions, power and&#13;
telecommunications, housing, industry and administration, the economy, human resources and the fabric&#13;
of civil society.  The 1997 peace agreement provides a context for enhanced assistance to national&#13;
recovery and reconstruction. Of the two main conflict areas, Khatlon (Vakhsh and Kofarnihon valleys)&#13;
has been effectively under government control and received external relief and rehabilitation assistance.&#13;
But the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area in the center of the country came under opposition control until&#13;
the peace accord. The area is strategically situated astride roads linking Dushanbe with Gorno-&#13;
Badakhshan (GBAO), and with Osh in Kyrgyzstan, along the Vakhsh river's major headwaters, the&#13;
Surkhob and Obihingou rivers. It shares a long border with Kyrgyzstan. Its five rayons, Darband&#13;
Gharm, Jirgital, Tojikobod, and Tavildara, contain almost 250,000 inhabitants.  Of its 200 km2,&#13;
90 percent is mountainous. The Karategin-Tavildara Valley area is critical to post-conflict rehabilitation&#13;
because of the damage it suffered, its relative neglect, and its strategic and political importance.&#13;
2.    The Bank, with UNDP/ UNOPS, conducted an assessment of needs, priorities for reconstruction,&#13;
including some stakeholder consultation in the five rayons over four weeks in September-October 1997.&#13;
Six trained investigators assisted by individual district specialists, visited every community (jamoat),&#13;
completed questionnaires with local leaders and commanders, who gave full cooperation. They&#13;
inventoried war damage, interviewed key informants, established local rehabilitation priorities and&#13;
compiled an extensive photographic record. This assessment seeks to be as comprehensive as possible.&#13;
It covers, in particular, needs in the sectors of roads and bridges, agriculture, power and&#13;
telecommunications, health, education and women, and indicates priorities for the local populations and&#13;
local leadership. It includes a partial stakeholder and institutional analysis.&#13;
3.    Most of the population lives in settlements along the main river banks. The Surkhob valley is&#13;
broad, contoured and well populated, while the Obihingou is narrow, precipitous and sparsely inhabited.&#13;
Before the war, the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area was a leading region in the production of potatoes,&#13;
export quality fruit, honey, wool, animal skins, meat and dairy produce, focusing on national urban and&#13;
export markets. It was a net importer of wheat. Mechanization was extensively used to maintain and&#13;
rehabilitate irrigation and land-protection structures, to prepare land, harvest and transport crops. The&#13;
main centers benefited from cheap internal air services, good roads, some local industry, and a good&#13;
level of education and basic health.&#13;
4.    Heavy fighting along the major roads and in the mountains, and aerial bombardment brought&#13;
great suffering to civilians. The five rayons were differently affected by the war: (i) Gharm rayon&#13;
(population 84,000) is the most developed, being effectively a regional center with an air strip and many&#13;
facilities, but suffered only moderately from hostilities; (ii) Darband (Komsomolobad) (63,000) suffered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
page 2 of 5&#13;
great infrastructural damage and prior neglect. Situated just upstream of the Rogun dam, and destined for&#13;
partial submersion, government investment since 1971 has focused on an uncompletecd (and uninhabited)&#13;
new regional capital; (iii) Jirgital (51,000) adjoining Kyrgyzstan, and being well behind the front lines,&#13;
suffered little direct damage, but its pre-existing poverty was exacerbated by isolation, economic&#13;
hardship and infrastructural deterioration and some destruction, and thus the district deserves inclusion in&#13;
the reconstruction program, and its border location is important for future road communications.&#13;
(iv) Tojikobod, (33,000) opposite Gharm, is a major agricultural district now in great decline; while&#13;
(v) Tavildara, (14,000, 6 percent of the area's population), possesses the most difficult terrain, the&#13;
Obihinkho Valley being narrow and steep. The war began here, and it suffered some of the heaviest&#13;
fighting, and a disproportionately high level of damage.&#13;
ASSESSMENT FINDINGS&#13;
5.    Roads and Bridges. The main Dushanbe-Jirgital road (A372) through Darband and Gharm to&#13;
Osh and Bishkek, connects the four main districts to markets, schools, enterprises, hospitals. The&#13;
Tavildara road (M41) connects GBAO to this road near Darband. Both are in poor repair, being virtually&#13;
impassable or dangerous in spots. Over a third of the 1,500 km of district and village roads are in bad&#13;
shape, mostly in Tavildara, Darband and Gharm. Of 158 bridges, over 100 were destroyed or damaged,&#13;
Darband and Tavildara being the worst affected. Several bridges are critical to communications, serving&#13;
large communities, while others link small isolated communities to the larger network or are designed&#13;
primarily for road protection and alignment. Bridges, being of strategic importance, suffered more than&#13;
roads. Roads require constant maintenance owing to local conditions (rock falls, mud-slides, river-bank&#13;
erosion), and most damage has been through lack of maintenance. All seven road management&#13;
departments, responsible for repair and maintenance, were destroyed and their equipment stolen. The six&#13;
asphalt-gravel mixing plants and gravel quarries are non-functional as is the precast concrete plant at&#13;
Gharm, which fabricated culverts and other components. For most people, local authorities and&#13;
specialists, the Dushanbe-Jirgital road is vital. They are less concerned with road quality, than with&#13;
ensuring year-round movement of traffic and access to internal and external inputs and markets. A&#13;
second priority is roads and bridges in Tavildara district, the only link from other parts of the country to&#13;
GBAO. Two other priorities are: (i) the 45 km of the road in Kamarob-Nazar Aeiloq, to connect the&#13;
main road to a major anthracite deposit, and enable small-scale artisanal extraction of coal for much-&#13;
needed winter heating; and (ii) completion of the Yamgalik bridge across the Surkhob, to link some&#13;
30,000 people to the main road.&#13;
6.    Agriculture. Agriculture suffered severe damage, through the loss of many factors: male labor;&#13;
machinery and the capacity to repair it; productive land (to mud-slides, flooding and erosion); access to&#13;
inputs and markets. While the state farming sector declined, private land was brought under wheat&#13;
cultivation, usually at higher productivity. Wheat production increased by over half in five years, with&#13;
almost three quarters of this coming from private land. By contrast, production of almost everything else&#13;
fell far below previous levels: potatoes, livestock, fruit, vegetables, and honey. The seven percent of&#13;
irrigated land accounted for most production. Irrigation system in every district were damaged; UNOPS&#13;
has installed or rehabilitated small local irrigation systems. Much agricultural machinery was looted or&#13;
deteriorated, and the Gharm central agricultural machinery repair workshop was destroyed. Local&#13;
priorities for agricultural rehabilitation are: seeds (especially potato); rehabilitation of irrigation systems&#13;
and destroyed agricultural machinery; rehabilitation of agricultural processing facilities; reconstruction&#13;
of destroyed bridges and roads to facilitate the marketing of goods in other regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
page 3 of 5&#13;
7.    Power and telecommunications. Extensive damage has been done to the main electricity supply&#13;
network, which provided the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area with power from Nurek. Power lines and&#13;
transformers, have been destroyed, looted or neglected with other transformers suffering from resultant&#13;
overload. The highly irregular supply or complete lack of electric power has had widely felt impacts in&#13;
all districts, and particularly in Darband and Tavildara. Economic and environmental consequences&#13;
include the cutting and burning of trees for winter fuel, which have depleted productive orchards and&#13;
forests.   The telephone service also proved extremely vulnerable to war, looting and lack of&#13;
maintenance, resulting in damage and destruction to about 60 percent of the system. Currently only&#13;
three of five rayon exchanges and none of the local exchanges are in service, with the Darband and&#13;
Tavildara systems completely out of operation. Priority areas for rehabilitation of are: repair of the&#13;
Obigharm to Gharm high tension line; reconstruction of the Gharm and Darband substations;&#13;
rehabilitation 80 km of the electricity line between Langar and Lodjurg in Tavildara; rehabilitation of&#13;
the Darband central telephone exchange.&#13;
8.    Health and sanitation.  Health care was organized according to the standard Former Soviet&#13;
Union hierarchy: 5 district hospitals (with the principal one in Gharm), 20 village hospitals, 17 rural&#13;
clinics or dispensaries and 119 rural health posts, together with district pharmacies,&#13;
sanitary/epidemiology stations, and 7 public bath houses. Health institutions were extensively damaged&#13;
by attack and looting of equipment and vehicles. Hospitals now "function" with almost no equipment or&#13;
supplies. Equally serious was the loss of professional staff, doctors and mid-level professionals, owing&#13;
to emigration, low salaries or their non-payment. Staff remaining show a high sense of dedication to&#13;
duty. Together with the deterioration of urban drinking water supplies and the destruction of public&#13;
baths, these changes have increased the risk of infectious and water-borne diseases, with hundreds of&#13;
cases being reported of typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, scabies and malaria. Priorities locally identified&#13;
amount, in effect, to the hope that the old system can be restored in entirety: rehabilitation and equipping&#13;
of district central hospitals, especially Gharm, and of village hospitals, local health posts, central&#13;
pharmacies, sanitary &amp; epidemiological stations and public baths; provision of medicines and vaccines&#13;
for prevalent diseases; rehabilitation of the only interregional tuberculosis hospital  (Gharm);&#13;
rehabilitation of the state psychiatric hospital in Navobod. A more focused response is discussed briefly&#13;
below.&#13;
9.    Education. The impact on education is similar to that on health, but affects more people on a&#13;
daily basis. Almost half of the schools have been damaged and destroyed (mostly in Tavildara, Gharm&#13;
and Darband). The learning environment sharply deteriorated. Classrooms lack heating, furniture, and&#13;
textbooks. Many children lacked suitable clothes and shoes, or do not attend owing to prevailing&#13;
insecurity. The number of teachers, the proportion of trained teachers, and the number and proportion of&#13;
women teachers have all declined, for the same reasons as in health. Reconstruction of facilities is&#13;
already being undertaken in some places with community support. Education priorities were identified&#13;
as: rehabilitation of destroyed and damaged schools; provision of winter heating, supplies and textbooks,&#13;
and school feeding and shoes and clothes to enable needy primary school pupils to attend.&#13;
10.   Housing. During the war, over 2,200 houses were damaged of which a quarter were destroyed.&#13;
This damage was mainly in Gharm and Tavildara, with Tavildara proportionately worst hit, and Gharm&#13;
most affected in absolute terms. People have begun reconstruction, hampered by lack of construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
page 4 of 5&#13;
materials, and often forced to sell cattle, their only tradable assets and often their only source of income.&#13;
Many houses have been patched up, often with thatch, mud, and recycled polyethylene sheeting. As a&#13;
result internal heating is poor, a major problem during winter months. Priorities for housing are&#13;
therefore, for the affected minority, a supply of building materials, including roofing materials, timber,&#13;
nails, cement, lime and glass. Other local building materials are available&#13;
11.   Social aspects: women, children, security and local government. Even before the civil war&#13;
women in the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area were below the national average in secondary and higher&#13;
education and least likely to work in the public service. With the war, the number of educated women&#13;
fell to a negligible amount. Most women in the area are unemployed, particularly in Tojikobod, Darband&#13;
and Tavildara. Families lost husbands, fathers, brothers, traditional bread-winners, leaving almost 4,500&#13;
female headed households and around 30,000 orphans (most informally cared for). Moreover, the&#13;
emigration of young males for employment has left a pool of over 11,000 marriageable but unmarried&#13;
girls, according to officials. Priorities for women are: organizing women's centers; micro-credit for petty&#13;
trade and small businesses; assistance in small enterprise development; training in home economics&#13;
including home births, sewing, processing of fruits and vegetables, traditional handicrafts.&#13;
12.   Industry. Many industrial plants were destroyed, mostly in Gharm, including the Gharm central&#13;
dairy processing factory, with a capacity of 24 tons per day; the pre-cast concrete factory, workshops for&#13;
repair and maintenance of agricultural machinery and road building.&#13;
13.   Relative priorities. A simple district ranking by proportionate damage to infrastructure resulted&#13;
in: (1) Tavildara; (2) Darband; (3) Tojikobod; (4) Gharm and (5) Jirgital. A priority ranking of 14&#13;
commonly expressed needs across districts, resulted in five clusters: (1) Seeds and employment; (2)&#13;
electricity, transport and fuel; (3) education, health and roads; (4) irrigation, drinking water, and bridges;&#13;
(5) food and telecommunications.&#13;
THE RESPONSE: PRINCIPLES, PRIORITIES AND PROCESS&#13;
14.   A first principle is to treat the needs of the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area as an emergency&#13;
situation, although it is not the poorest part of the country. This approach is justified by: the extent of&#13;
damage; the collapse of the productive economy and of most educational, health and social protection&#13;
services, together with the ineffectiveness of local government machinery; lack of effective relief and&#13;
rehabilitation over the last three years; and the impoverishment and asset depletion of ordinary people.&#13;
Fragile local institutions, widespread expectations of a peace dividend, and local willingness to&#13;
participate in rehabilitation all point to an opportunity to consolidate peace, in which the next six months&#13;
are critical so as to help people through the difficult winter and early spring months, and ensure the 1998&#13;
spring planting and harvest.&#13;
15.   Secondly, the focus should be on functional rehabilitation, which bridges the gap between relief&#13;
on one side and development on the other. Emergency investment is targeted so as to meet immediate&#13;
priority needs, including those of the poor and vulnerable, while laying the basis for future development.&#13;
This requires the rehabilitation of essential functions rather than the reconstruction of specific would not&#13;
necessarily respond to the entire catalogue of needs identified in the survey, since it is natural, in&#13;
presenting needs, that people would tend to wish to restore what had been there before. Local&#13;
consultation on the best use of limited resources to ensure quick impact will therefore be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

16.    Thirdly, resource allocation must take account of the diverse needs of different rayons,&#13;
communities and population elements. Each district is different, and has different priorities. In order to&#13;
avert fears that some districts may receive less assistance than they deserve, the process of decision-&#13;
making has to be inclusive, transparent and fair, with public information, open discussion, local&#13;
consultation and confidence-building. Sufficiently broad local consultation would also help to ensure&#13;
that benefits are widely spread. An implication for design is flexibility in the allocation of funds, which&#13;
should not be too rigidly pre-programmed. A modest relief response is still required to address the&#13;
urgent humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable, particularly in Tavildara. Tavildara should be treated&#13;
as a special case, with a higher per capita investment, by virtue of its high level of destruction, its small&#13;
population, and its limited economic potential. The rehabilitation needs of the other four districts in the&#13;
Surkhob valley are similar and interconnected, and all jamoats should be eligible.&#13;
17.    Investment priorities within sectors, as indicated by the needs assessment, should focus on:&#13;
(i) Agriculture: ensure the preconditions for a sustained increase in production and family incomes,&#13;
starting in the new year, through the provision of seeds and essential inputs, supplemented by&#13;
rehabilitation of necessary infrastructure and local capacity: key road communications for storage,&#13;
transport and processing and marketing of field crops and fruit; land protection and preparation;&#13;
rehabilitation of machinery.  The timing of agricultural inputs and land preparation is critical,&#13;
(ii) Education and health: restore essential services, to avert the risk of a "lost generation" of children&#13;
who had neither adequate education nor health care. The objective should be to ensure restored basic&#13;
education functions during the first year and the operation of most schools through the 1998-9 winter,&#13;
probably with a priority to secondary education; and to ensure essential immunization, maternal and&#13;
child care services. (iii) a widely distributed and targeted program of local rehabilitation microprojects,&#13;
to be implemented with full local government and community participation; with selection criteria based&#13;
on local priorities. This will help to restore purchansing power and reduce poverty. There could also the&#13;
completion of some works started before 1991 where this would be cost effective. and to complement&#13;
any common interventions of small, local microprojects that respond to specific local priorities. Special&#13;
issues in relation to specific districts are dealt with below under investment choices.&#13;
18.    Process. It will be important to ensure close interagency coordination, as well as full partnership&#13;
with local leadership, communities and government institutions. The area's ample human resource of&#13;
educated and skilled people that should be tapped. The creation of parallel local government or&#13;
implementation mechanisms should be avoided. Local government can develop expertise in preparing&#13;
tenders; managing local contractors for the implementation of small works; of working in partnership&#13;
with local community contributions; and handling some funds transparently. There should therefore be&#13;
a process of phased devolution of responsibility to local government. In addition the local military&#13;
forces should not be excluded from the consultative process, particularly in the early stages, although&#13;
their role should not be allowed to usurp that of local authorities. The process of demobilization, and the&#13;
reintegration of forces into the community, is part of building civil society, and it would be unwise to&#13;
attempt to marginalize local military forces. Poverty monitoring using simple local mechanisms is&#13;
required to track poverty indicators, to ensure the transparent and effective use of resources, the effective&#13;
targeting of relief, and assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program.&#13;

            Reconstruction Project

        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the
            Post-conflict Emergency Reconstruction Project is to support
            the Government's strategy for the successful
            implementation of the Peace Agreement by facilitating the
            reintegration of the Karategin-Tavildara Valley area into
            the national economy through a targeted agricultural
            development.  The project will help finance the following
            components: a) agricultural support including the emergency
            purchase and distribution of agricultural inputs to private
            farmers for the Spring 1998 planting season; b) bridges and
            roads providing for the repair or reconstruction of about
            fifteen destroyed or damaged bridges as well as the
            completion of a 4kms by-pass road for the town of Darband to
            replace the currently existing non-functional road; c) small
            community works aiming at the reconstruction, repair and/or
            rehabilitation of destroyed, damaged or dilapidated schools,
            health care facilities and other community facilities as
            well as the implementation of other programs of small works
            benefiting local communities in the Karategin-Tavildara
            Valley area; and d) other infrastructure works providing for
            the repair and rehabilitation of war-damaged infrastructure
            elements in the power and agriculture sector.
