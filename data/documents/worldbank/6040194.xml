of these resource flows to developing countries&#13;
is as a shift from debt to equity finance (figure&#13;

            Private finance : are private loans and

        <abstracts>
            Private financial flows to developing
            countries, such as debt,equity, remittances, and private
            charitable giving, have increaseddramatically over the past
            20 years. One commentator has eventrumpeted &#147;the
            privatization of foreign aid. Since privatecharitable giving
            remains small and developing country governmentsare
            borrowing more, not less, from official sources, this claim
            ismisleading. But unprecedented sums are indeed flowing to
            theprivate sector in developing countries.
