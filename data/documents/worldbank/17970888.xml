&amp;#12;Memorialist's Name: Roger A. Chaufoumier&#13;
&#13;
Date oflnterview:    July 22, 1986&#13;
&#13;
Place oflnterview: The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
Interviewer's Name: Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think we might begin our conversation by my asking about why you&#13;
&#13;
came to the Bank, your experience before you came to the Bank, and then some&#13;
&#13;
highlights of your career in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Thank you Professor Oliver. Starting with your first question,&#13;
&#13;
why I came to the Bank, it's a result of part design and part accident. Part design&#13;
&#13;
perhaps, because I came from a family with a long tradition of civil service, and public&#13;
&#13;
service has always been very attractive to me. I was trained as a lawyer, then moved to&#13;
&#13;
economics, sociology, political science. In fact my intellectual and philosophical&#13;
&#13;
bent was largely influenced by the events of the war years; at the end of the hostilities&#13;
&#13;
a number of us young students who had opted for the Resistance decided to reflect&#13;
&#13;
on the new directions of French policy and French politics and established what we&#13;
&#13;
called Le Cercle Social et Economigue Inter Ecoles. There were students of the&#13;
&#13;
Grandes Ecoles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Cercle was a forum to discuss economic, political and social problems of&#13;
&#13;
France and the role of France in the world in the post-war years. And it is perhaps&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
from these early years of reflecting about the problems that my interest in the problems&#13;
&#13;
of development continued to grow. So I moved to economics, sociology, political&#13;
&#13;
science. I was fortunate to have a number of fellowships to pursue my education,&#13;
&#13;
which brought me to England, then to Sweden and finally to the United States as a&#13;
&#13;
Fulbright Scholar. There I pursued my studies at the University of Illinois in&#13;
&#13;
economics and served on the faculty staff as a consultant for the University to the&#13;
&#13;
Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   And it is after I came to Washington that I joined the World Bank in 1952 at the&#13;
&#13;
invitation of the then-Director of the Economics Staff, Leonard Rist. This was the time&#13;
&#13;
of the first major reorganization of the World Bank, and instead of joining the Economics&#13;
&#13;
Staff, I joined the newly-created Department of Operations, Western Hemisphere under&#13;
&#13;
the directorship of [J.] Burke Knapp and Orvis [A.] Schmidt, his deputy, and started&#13;
&#13;
working as a young economist in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Would you say a word about your work in the Scandinavian countries,&#13;
&#13;
because I think that is relevant to some of the things you became interested&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, my interest in the social sciences was to understand the&#13;
&#13;
forces which influence economic development, the dynamics of economic&#13;
&#13;
development. I focused on one particular aspect, on which I wrote my doctoral&#13;
&#13;
dissertation in sociology called "Social Classes in Sweden," which was an attempt at&#13;
&#13;
tracing the evolution of social attitudes and social relations, group relations, as&#13;
&#13;
economic development progressed and became more complex in modern society.&#13;
&#13;
And this is what led me, later on, to an interest in the problems of income distribution, to&#13;
&#13;
the disparities in income and levels ofliving in different parts of the world. So there&#13;
&#13;
was some coherence and some logic in my thinking and in my approach to problems,&#13;
&#13;
both intellectually and emotionally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And you must have had considerable sympathy for the redistribution-&#13;
&#13;
with-growth concepts of the [RobertS.] McNamara years, in particular, in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, indeed, oh, indeed. One never forgets one's early youth.&#13;
&#13;
One remembers that during the war one has been hungry, one has experienced&#13;
&#13;
the feeling of injustice, the feeling of poverty, the feeling of hunger, an experience&#13;
&#13;
which naturally generates some greater sympathy for the underdog, for those who&#13;
&#13;
have experienced these problems.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Might I just ask, though it's not directly relevant to the Bank&#13;
&#13;
years, where you were during World War II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: At the beginning ofthe war I was still a very young man. I was&#13;
&#13;
not yet 16. The first part of the war, I was able to continue my studies but my family,&#13;
&#13;
which had been active politically in France, was fairly exposed; its position against the&#13;
&#13;
occupation, against Nazi Germany at the time, was well known. My family was&#13;
&#13;
prosecuted, and I had to go into hiding and join the underground at that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was this in Paris or....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I stayed in Paris for part of the time and then finally came&#13;
&#13;
back to the central part of France.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That would have been near Nevers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Very close to Nevers, yes, and that whole general area of the&#13;
&#13;
Berry and Bourbonnais, yes indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, let us come back to the economics work in the Bank. You came&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank supposing that you would do work in rather general economics of&#13;
&#13;
the sort that Paul Rosenstein-Rodan and others had been doing but found yourself as&#13;
&#13;
country economist in the Western Hemisphere Department. Would you say a word&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
about the changes in the Bank that were going on at that time and the economics work in&#13;
&#13;
an Area departments?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, I was, I think, quite fortunate to join the Bank as a&#13;
&#13;
young economist in the Western Hemisphere Department because the whole direction&#13;
&#13;
of that Department attached a great deal of importance to economics. Both the Director&#13;
&#13;
and Deputy Director were economists and practitioners of economics and greatly&#13;
&#13;
influenced the nature and extent of economic work as a foundation for their judgments&#13;
&#13;
on the member countries. One has to remember at the time that the Bank was essentially&#13;
&#13;
a project lender. We were asking essentially two questions: Is the project viable?&#13;
&#13;
Can the country repay the obligation? We had some very simple rules of thumb. When&#13;
&#13;
the debt service of the country exceeded ten percent, this was the warning signal, so we&#13;
&#13;
had to ask more questions. We have learned to live more comfortably with higher ratios&#13;
&#13;
now, but this was all at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  At the same time, there was already very early an attempt at getting a much better&#13;
&#13;
understanding of what made the economy of a particular country tick, what made it work.&#13;
&#13;
And there were a number of basic survey missions organized very early in the Eugene&#13;
&#13;
Black administration. The first one was on Cuba. The work of an economist at the&#13;
&#13;
time was certainly not very hurried. We worked at an economic survey once every&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
three years on a country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   I remember writing the first economic report on Bolivia under Richard [F.] Quandt.&#13;
&#13;
We had plenty of time to get acquainted with the country and there was a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
satisfaction in the work of an economist because you had the continuity of association&#13;
&#13;
with one or two countries and could do work in sufficient depth to understand what made&#13;
&#13;
the country function, and how the Bank could better respond in helping that country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   At the same time, the connection between the economic work and the lending&#13;
&#13;
decision was tenuous at best. The major issue was credit worthiness. It developed into&#13;
&#13;
an attempt at establishing priorities. Then the Bank helped countries developed their&#13;
&#13;
planning organization, their public investment programs, and this led gradually to&#13;
&#13;
extensive technical assistance, which led me four years later to serve as an adviser and&#13;
&#13;
as Resident Representative in Peru, essentially to assist the Government organize its&#13;
&#13;
planning organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How long were you in Peru?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Four years. Initially for two years, but it was extended at&#13;
&#13;
the request of the Government. So I stayed four years.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were you there by yourself, or were you there as part of a Bank mission?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: The first year, it was a two-man mission. Hubert Havlik was&#13;
&#13;
the Chief of the Mission the first year and I served as the economist. When Hubert left,&#13;
&#13;
I became Chief of the Mission, and Mervyn Weiner joined me as economist during the&#13;
&#13;
last three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In the case of the earlier work before you went to Peru, were you a part of&#13;
&#13;
some of the large survey missions, like the one that wrote the report on Cuba,&#13;
&#13;
for example?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Unfortunately not. I was never given that opportunity. The&#13;
&#13;
closest I came to it was the first mission to Ecuador, where I was the economist&#13;
&#13;
member of a general operational mission and the work was quite integrated. In fact,&#13;
&#13;
the first program of activities in Ecuador was based on discussion held in the field&#13;
&#13;
between the various technicians: economists, engineers, loan officers. Priorities were&#13;
&#13;
established at the time in close discussion with the government. The first highway&#13;
&#13;
project in the Guyana region was the closest we came to an integration of operational&#13;
&#13;
work and economic work in that country. That was late 1953, 1954.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When you were doing work as a country economist for Bolivia, would&#13;
&#13;
you go down by yourself, or with a small mission in the process of writing your report?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: At that time Bolivia was a special case. One must remember&#13;
&#13;
that at that time the World Bank didn't lend to quite a number of countries which were&#13;
&#13;
in default on their obligations and which were not making what the Bank considered to&#13;
&#13;
be a reasonable effort at settling this obligation. Bolivia was one of these countries,&#13;
&#13;
Guatemala was another. And also at that time there were no operations actually&#13;
&#13;
planned in Bolivia; it was a first reconnaissance mission in the expectation that we&#13;
&#13;
would soon be able to resume operations after the settlement of the debt. And this was&#13;
&#13;
only a two-man mission, which was the first Bank mission to that country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And for how long?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, three weeks in the field. At the time one must remember&#13;
&#13;
you couldn't go by road from La Paz to Santa Cruz. The first major road was being&#13;
&#13;
constructed at the time. It was very difficult to get a good impression of that country with&#13;
&#13;
the limited facilities we had in the capital city. So it was largely an intellectual exercise&#13;
&#13;
based on statistics, on discussions with knowledgeable persons in the country, based on&#13;
&#13;
the feel of the economy of that country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Would you comment on the relationship in those days between the economic&#13;
&#13;
work and operations work as it was called? To what extent were you invited to comment&#13;
&#13;
on specific projects that were in the works for a particular country?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                   -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes. The relation existed quite clearly, although it was not as close&#13;
&#13;
as it became later. Any time we presented a project to the Board we made a presentation&#13;
&#13;
on the economy of the country, the general context in which that project would fit,&#13;
&#13;
indicating general priorities of the country. Much of the economic work on the country&#13;
&#13;
was just intended to do that. The country economic work was developing at that time,&#13;
&#13;
particularly in the late fifties and early sixties, and was a foundation for the later&#13;
&#13;
development of economic work when George [D.] Woods carne as President.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  In 1960, for example, when the President of Colombia visited President Eisenhower,&#13;
&#13;
he asked whether the U.S. and the World Bank could help organize a conference on the&#13;
&#13;
development of Colombia to coordinate aid to Colombia. At that time the Bank didn't&#13;
&#13;
have any consultative group. There were the India and Pakistan consortia.          These were&#13;
&#13;
exceptions and were intended only to assist the very large, poor countries in raising&#13;
&#13;
money in order to pull them out of a very difficult crisis.    But it was already at this time&#13;
&#13;
that much greater attention was given to the development of aid coordination, which&#13;
&#13;
received a greater impetus under George Woods. The first consultative group was in fact&#13;
&#13;
held for Columbia three years later in 1963, another one for Chile, and also for other&#13;
&#13;
countries. It was at that time, in the early sixties, that you had a much greater integration&#13;
&#13;
of the economic work in the operational work, and I believe that much more of that&#13;
&#13;
integration took place in Latin American than in any other region of the world.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -10-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
   A contributing factor was the launching of the Alliance for Progress, which was&#13;
&#13;
essentially the idea of a compact between the United States and Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
Countries were told they would get support for their development if they implemented&#13;
&#13;
the necessary reforms. That led to a much greater amount of economic work in depth&#13;
&#13;
to serve as the intellectual foundation for this exercise. So under the Alliance for&#13;
&#13;
Progress and the work in Colombia the coordination between the Fund and the Bank on&#13;
&#13;
Colombia became very close, perhaps as close as it is today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Let me be sure I understand what you're telling me, because this&#13;
&#13;
seems to be quite important.   You're telling me that the first official consultative group&#13;
&#13;
that was established under the aegis of the Bank was for Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Was for Colombia, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And for that country alone?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Bill [William] Diamond was Deputy Director of the Western&#13;
&#13;
Hemisphere Department at the time when the idea of a consultative group began to&#13;
&#13;
mature. I was the Division Chief for Chile at the time and worked on the formulation of&#13;
&#13;
the first consultative group for that country. It was different from a consortium; a&#13;
&#13;
consortium was a means of gap-filling, of raising resources to meet a gap in a particular&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
period of time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And that was already in existence?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: That was already in existence, yes sir. There was great reluctance&#13;
&#13;
on the part of the other industrial countries to extend the consortium exercise to other&#13;
&#13;
countries, for fear that it would put too much pressure on them. On the other hand, the&#13;
&#13;
idea of the consultative group was a much more flexible idea of a forum in which the&#13;
&#13;
development problems, the policy, the needs, the priorities of a given country would be&#13;
&#13;
discussed in the hope that by better illumination of these issues through the group, it&#13;
&#13;
would facilitate the flow of resources. It was not intended to provide specific&#13;
&#13;
commitment, but was providing a better basis for making decisions and through that&#13;
&#13;
process it was hoped that additional resources would be raised. The Colombia&#13;
&#13;
Consultative Group came first; there happened to be at the time very good economic&#13;
&#13;
work being done in Colombia. There was already a World Bank adviser in Colombia&#13;
&#13;
working with the Planning Office. The Government of Colombia was very committed to&#13;
&#13;
aid coordination at the time. So we started the first consultative group about 1963 in&#13;
&#13;
Colombia. Then it was followed by others later on. It started in Latin America, which&#13;
&#13;
reflected, I think, the fact of greater integration of economic work with operational work&#13;
&#13;
in that part of the world.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -12-&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Have there been consultative groups that dealt with more than one country at&#13;
&#13;
a time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I don't recall any at the time. The Caribbean Group came later.&#13;
&#13;
There was much discussion on whether we should have a consultative group for the&#13;
&#13;
country or for a sector. Later on, as you know, different formulae evolved. But already&#13;
&#13;
I think the idea was that, from the standpoint of planning the operation, the country as&#13;
&#13;
the package of operation was very much established. In some other regions of the&#13;
&#13;
world later on you could speak about some central theme which are common to groups&#13;
&#13;
of countries, Sub-Saharan Africa and so on, agriculture in semi-arid areas, around&#13;
&#13;
which one could organize discussion, organize your work on these themes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You also said that the idea for putting together a consultative group really&#13;
&#13;
began with the Colombian Government, which asked for help. I assume that consultative&#13;
&#13;
groups might have been suggested by the Bank for other countries, but the real request&#13;
&#13;
for such an organization must have come from the government of the country involved?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Absolutely. There have been several donors which at different&#13;
&#13;
times have had a different interest in different countries who have expressed the view&#13;
&#13;
that it would be good to have a consultative group, but there's been always an important&#13;
&#13;
consideration: we had to feel that not only the country had enough of a development&#13;
&#13;
plan, of a program which constituted basis for useful discussion, but that the country&#13;
&#13;
was really committed to the idea of coordination. The consultative group implies a&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -13-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
certain amount of give and take. Countries expose their policies to discussion and to&#13;
&#13;
criticism by others in exchange for donors' interest in providing assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Are there consultative groups for some countries that work through&#13;
&#13;
some international organization other than the World Bank, like OECD, for example?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: In recent years, under UN auspices, there have been fora for&#13;
&#13;
country discussions, particularly for technical assistance, but I think the donors have&#13;
&#13;
always felt that unless the consultative group was a grouping of countries which was&#13;
&#13;
clearly intending to provide assistance, had a financial stake in it, it was not going to&#13;
&#13;
succeed. You could not expose countries, expose their policies, simply with no results;&#13;
&#13;
you had to have the expectation that in good faith, donors would come forth. Only&#13;
&#13;
donor countries who had clearly expressed an interest in providing assistance were&#13;
&#13;
invited, not simply those interested in simply listening or getting intelligence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The reason I asked about OECD is because donor governments do have&#13;
&#13;
representatives permanently in Paris and they do make presentations about how their&#13;
&#13;
own bilateral aid programs are progressing, so it occurred to me that they might put&#13;
&#13;
together consultative groups through that kind of framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Perhaps the comparative advantage the World Bank had is that,&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
as an international organization, it was less constrained by the niceties of international&#13;
&#13;
diplomacy. Bilateral donors are limited as to what they can do. The World Bank could&#13;
&#13;
ask some of the hard questions; it had an experienced staff to provide a good analytical&#13;
&#13;
foundation for the exercise. Although the program had to be presented to the countries&#13;
&#13;
to be their program, the role of the Bank in assisting the country in developing this&#13;
&#13;
program, in a way which would give them a chance of success, was very important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You are saying that a consultative group is likely to be paid more attention to&#13;
&#13;
if it tends also to represent sources of aid. I wonder whether or not a consultative group&#13;
&#13;
and a consortium might essentially be the same body at the same time, or do you think of&#13;
&#13;
them as entirely separate?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: There was an important difference between the two. The&#13;
&#13;
consortium was a gap-filling exercise. In the consultative group the Bank always had&#13;
&#13;
to respect the wishes of the donor countries; they didn't want to be called to a meeting&#13;
&#13;
to be forced to make a firm commitment, as is called for in a consortium. However, we&#13;
&#13;
always took the position that if the donors were not obligated to make commitments at&#13;
&#13;
the consultative group meetings, they were expected to increase their support over time.&#13;
&#13;
Otherwise the recipient countries would no longer agree to participate in the consultative&#13;
&#13;
group. So it was an in-between always and the Bank would aid the countries to prepare&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -15-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
their program, and to implement the necessary economic reforms while at the same time&#13;
&#13;
exercising moral suasion on the donors to respond positively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand. When you were working in the Western Hemisphere&#13;
&#13;
Department were there countries in addition to Columbia for whom consultative groups&#13;
&#13;
were established?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes, indeed. I chaired a meeting to organize the first consultative&#13;
&#13;
group for Peru, and one which was to try to establish consultative group for Brazil. It&#13;
&#13;
was not established at that time, but there was a meeting on Brazil where Mr. Campos&#13;
&#13;
made a presentation of the Brazilian development program. That was about the same&#13;
&#13;
time as the consultative group for Peru. And then a consultative group for Chile was&#13;
&#13;
established, and there have been others, but I don't recall exactly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Are there major incidents or experiences, highlights of the years that you were&#13;
&#13;
working in Latin America, that come to mind that you could like to mention?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, I think what impressed me during those years was, in&#13;
&#13;
fact, the growing integration of our economic and operational work. Many of the ideas&#13;
&#13;
which today are taken for granted in non-project lending were already very much present .&#13;
&#13;
at the time. For instance, in Colombia there was much discussion at the time of the&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -16-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
consultative group for Colombia, the first one, of program aid, non-project lending, as&#13;
&#13;
part of a program of assistance where both the Fund and the Bank would cooperate and&#13;
&#13;
coordinate on the basic analysis, on the policy framework, and would provide non-&#13;
&#13;
project loans, the kind of flexible program assistance to make the whole program&#13;
&#13;
possible. Program lending developed in a number of Latin American countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Another example of the close cooperation between the Fund and the Bank was in&#13;
&#13;
countries like Argentina and Uruguay. I remember Argentina, where relations with&#13;
&#13;
Bank at some time were closer than they were with the Fund and vice versa at other&#13;
&#13;
times. I think it was interesting in that period that the Fund was beginning to take a&#13;
&#13;
much longer view of the problems of stabilization, and the Bank was paying closer&#13;
&#13;
attention to the problem of stabilization in relation to financing development to try to&#13;
&#13;
integrate the two, which is very much what we are discussing today in the case of&#13;
&#13;
Argentina.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  In the case of Argentina, I remember that the Bank negotiated the devaluation ofthe&#13;
&#13;
Argentine peso. We considered that, although it was basically the responsibility of the&#13;
&#13;
Fund, it was so critical to the long-term development ofthe country by providing the&#13;
&#13;
necessary price incentives; the Fund was not in a position to do it at the time, so we did it.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time ...&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: About what period are you talking about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, that was 1966 ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It was during the Woods years?&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: That was during the Woods years, that's right. The Fund would&#13;
&#13;
look at the rehabilitation of the Argentine railways because the railway sector was&#13;
&#13;
causing the largest part of the budget deficit. There was no way of stabilizing the&#13;
&#13;
economy unless some longer-term reforms were put in place. I think it's during this&#13;
&#13;
period that I remember how the relation between stabilization and development was&#13;
&#13;
evolving in close cooperation between the Bank and the Fund. That was very much&#13;
&#13;
present in many of the discussions we had in Colombia, in Brazil, in Argentina.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But not, I take it, during the fifties?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: No, that came in the sixties. That started in the sixties, essentially&#13;
&#13;
after 1961, 1962. Now George Woods--I think this is one of his great contributions --&#13;
&#13;
attached great importance to the idea of closer aid coordination. He very much supported&#13;
&#13;
all the efforts we made to multiply the consultative groups, gave great support to them&#13;
&#13;
and to coordination with the Fund as well. I recall that when Irving [S.] Friedman came&#13;
&#13;
from the Fund to the Bank to help, he gave much greater role to economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
An Economic Committee was set up under George Woods, a new committee; any&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
loan proposal had to go both before the Loan Committee and the Economic Committee,&#13;
&#13;
and that forced a greater integration of our economic and operational work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I interrupt to ask about the definition of the Economic Committee. I&#13;
&#13;
have been told that there was an organization called an Economic Committee in the&#13;
&#13;
fifties, but what you're telling me is that the Economic Committee was really&#13;
&#13;
reconstituted and given much greater authority under Woods?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFQURNIER: It was, that's right; it was reconstituted at a higher level of&#13;
&#13;
responsibility and in the context of a procedure which insured that the views of the&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee had to be taken into account before the proposal would go to the&#13;
&#13;
Board. I think this is what gave it a greater role. George Woods also, in the general&#13;
&#13;
context of greater coordination of aid, opened much closer cooperation with other UN&#13;
&#13;
agencies. On the first couple of programs consultation was set up under George Woods.&#13;
&#13;
So aid coordination, greater integration of the economic, greater importance given to the&#13;
&#13;
economic work took place in that period of 1963 to 1968, under George Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think you were also telling me that even before George Woods there was a&#13;
&#13;
closer cooperation between Operations people and economists in the Western&#13;
&#13;
Hemisphere Department, and that there were some loans which in a sense might have&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
been called program loans ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: ... so that much of this work really begins ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: It started earlier, during the later years of Eugene Black.&#13;
&#13;
The Alliance for Progress was launched in 1961, the Punta del Este Conference was in&#13;
&#13;
1961. The time was much more favorable to foreign aid. The whole context was&#13;
&#13;
different. The environment was more conducive to launch new ideas; this is also&#13;
&#13;
because the Alliance for Progress was behind the idea of performance. Money wasn't&#13;
&#13;
free, it was to support adequate programs of reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I think George Woods' emphasis was on performance. Performance meant&#13;
&#13;
different things before: respect of foreign obligations, rigor in the analysis of projects,&#13;
&#13;
in setting priorities, but we began to enter an area of judging performance on a much&#13;
&#13;
broader range of issues, of economic issues, the general management of the economy,&#13;
&#13;
the general quality of the management of the economy of the country. And that was&#13;
&#13;
started under George Woods in an environment which was propitious for this kind of&#13;
&#13;
approach because it was supported by major donors.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: One other factor that I would have supposed might have had some&#13;
&#13;
effect upon the Western Hemisphere Department was that by the late fifties, if I'm&#13;
&#13;
correct, Jerry (Gerald] Alter was the Director and he was an economist. He had come&#13;
&#13;
into the Bank as an economist. I guess I'm fishing for the proposition that economists&#13;
&#13;
may, by the nature of their way of thinking about things, be more interested in the&#13;
&#13;
interrelationships of various parts of the economy than people who are strictly concerned&#13;
&#13;
with an individual project. I don't want to put words into your mouth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I think very much so. I much believe that Jerry Alter had a&#13;
&#13;
great influence on the improvement of the general quality of the economic work on&#13;
&#13;
placing more importance on performance, economic performance, and integrating&#13;
&#13;
economic work and operational work. I think that when Jerry asked me to be his deputy,&#13;
&#13;
that was one of his considerations. He wanted to concentrate on economic work, but he&#13;
&#13;
wanted to integrate operational work and he wanted to have an economist as deputy who&#13;
&#13;
would take care of operations. I think we had a good working relationship in that respect,&#13;
&#13;
working together to help integrate the two, perhaps a little better than if we hadn't had the&#13;
&#13;
same background, the same intellectual interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When did you leave the Western Hemisphere Department? Where did&#13;
&#13;
you go?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I left the Western Hemisphere Department in 1968 after Robert&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
McNamara came to the Bank and asked me to become Director of the newly created&#13;
&#13;
Western Africa Department. That was 1968.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right, then. Before we come to 1968, perhaps we should talk a&#13;
&#13;
little bit more about the Woods years in the Bank. You've already talked about his&#13;
&#13;
interest in integrating economic work more into the operations of the Bank. You've&#13;
&#13;
talked about Irving Friedman's coming to the Bank. You've talked about the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
working more closely with the Fund and some other UN agencies. What other major&#13;
&#13;
developments do you associate with this period in the history of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I should, perhaps, begin by saying that what I am going to say&#13;
&#13;
may be slightly biased in crediting George with a great many more accomplishments&#13;
&#13;
than he's 1.\sually credited for. In saying this, I am perhaps influenced by the personality&#13;
&#13;
of George Woods himself, whom I always found extremely fascinating. First, I think&#13;
&#13;
perhaps one reason why he was able to broaden the activities of the Bank was he&#13;
&#13;
recognized that some important elements of development were left out of it; he felt there&#13;
&#13;
was too much concentration on bricks and mortar, that the human element, education,&#13;
&#13;
and agriculture were very fundamental.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I remember a comment made by Pierre Moussa in an article many years ago&#13;
&#13;
about his experience with George Woods. He said that George Woods reminded&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
him of Pope John. Here was a very, very distinguished person whom the Cardinals&#13;
&#13;
thought, by electing him as Pope, would not rock the boat. But he produced a great&#13;
&#13;
many changes in the Church, in the orientation of the Church. Moussa was comparing&#13;
&#13;
Pope John with George Woods, saying that here was a man, Chairman of the Board of&#13;
&#13;
First Boston, respected in the financial community, never suspecting that he would be the&#13;
&#13;
first to launch the Bank into financing education. But he was able to do it because he&#13;
&#13;
had their respect, because the Bank was well established and steady. I think this is&#13;
&#13;
one of his major contributions toward the most important activities of the Bank, much&#13;
&#13;
more the full service Bank for development: agriculture and education. When George&#13;
&#13;
left, only about, I think, five percent of the total Bank lending would go to the social&#13;
&#13;
sector, but he had broken the ice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I think this reflected what I very much liked in George, being myself a young man in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank trying to search for new ideas of helping countries. George had such a breadth&#13;
&#13;
of interest, an interest in the arts, an interest in the circus. It meant a very versatile mind&#13;
&#13;
and ability to get off the beaten path, not take everything for granted, innovative, creative.&#13;
&#13;
He liked ideas, he had a sense for ideas, he knew how to recognize a new idea--not only&#13;
&#13;
to recognize it but to have ideas of his own. I think this is what his contribution was.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                               -23-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
His makeup made it possible to move the Bank in that direction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I interrupt once again? I think it's interesting that you characterize&#13;
&#13;
George Woods as a young man. In point of fact, he was just one year younger than&#13;
&#13;
Eugene Black.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I meant of myself as a young man, this is what I liked too in&#13;
&#13;
George, because a young man is always a little impatient to move ahead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Of course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER He wanted to move into education, wanted to move into&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, into discussing the Bank...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Might I infer that, when George Woods came to the Bank, he behaved&#13;
&#13;
as a young man in the sense of being vigorous and having many ideas?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes. In mind he had this youthful way of looking at new ideas&#13;
&#13;
and not being bogged down in procedure. He had a very strong instinct for development,&#13;
&#13;
what works, what doesn't work. One day we are looking at a hydroelectric project in the&#13;
&#13;
south of Argentina.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Project?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: A very large project, El Chocon hydroelectric project. When&#13;
&#13;
the experts looked at it, they looked at the power aspects, in terms of return of six&#13;
&#13;
percent, it was not very good. And one day I met George in the elevator and he said,&#13;
&#13;
"Where does the project stand?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I said, "Well, Mr. Woods, the return is still around six percent."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   And he said, "Little people only think in rates of return". Now he knew that the rate&#13;
&#13;
of return was an important element of discipline, but he wasn't bound to that alone. He&#13;
&#13;
was looking at something else; he had instincts and he was going to push it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Another anecdote. He would also work very directly with people. He believed in&#13;
&#13;
getting things done, so if you would get it done, he would call you and say, "Can you do&#13;
&#13;
that?" He called me once and said, "Look, we have had an economic mission in Italy for&#13;
&#13;
several weeks; they have not produced their report yet and Carli, the Governor ofthe&#13;
&#13;
Bank of Italy, has asked me to lend him $80 million to get him through a difficult balance&#13;
&#13;
of payment crisis. I know they are going to pull out of it, ifl give $80 million to&#13;
&#13;
Italy today, I'll get much more in return in support for the IDA Replenishment. You get&#13;
&#13;
down there, you get me a project quickly. This is important for Italy, not for the amount&#13;
&#13;
of money, but for the symbol, what it means." He had this vision of the important things&#13;
&#13;
he ought to do.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's very interesting. His not being Wlduly concerned about the rate of&#13;
&#13;
return related, I suppose, to his being interested in pushing education, where as I&#13;
&#13;
Wlderstand it the Bank does not try to calculate precise rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Very interesting question, because the first education at that time&#13;
&#13;
was vocational-professional education. When you get into general education, the first&#13;
&#13;
project was a vocational training project in Chile. We had to calculate a rate of return for&#13;
&#13;
this first project, just as we had in the first rural development project in Upper Volta. We&#13;
&#13;
had to calculate the rate of return for village wells. Finally we decided that some things&#13;
&#13;
had to be considered as absolutes but there was still very much the mystique of the rate of&#13;
&#13;
return. I'm not saying that George did not stress the importance of return; he was a very&#13;
&#13;
rigorous man in project analysis, but he wasn't boWld simply by one indicator. H.e had a&#13;
&#13;
global vision of things, he would see the other aspects, he had very good peripheral&#13;
&#13;
vision of problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did he have at least an intuitive conception of what the economists&#13;
&#13;
call externalities?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes, that's what it was. It wasn't just typical of this particular&#13;
&#13;
project in Argentina; there were externalities. It was a project of regional development&#13;
&#13;
for the south of Argentina. I'm not saying that he predicted the oil crisis and that hydro&#13;
&#13;
power would be the thing to do. He had a vision of other externalities, even of the&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
psychological benefits, what it meant to a government to support a major development&#13;
&#13;
project which achieved at least a minimum rate of return, but in addition a lot of&#13;
&#13;
advantages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Would you comment on the evolution of the economics work in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
during the Woods years? In a sense it was under two heads: one was the country&#13;
&#13;
economic work such as you were doing, and the other was the general economic work&#13;
&#13;
under Friedman and [Andrew M.] Kamarck.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes. Very much work was done. Commodity work was expanded&#13;
&#13;
substantially. The debt work was done in a much greater depth, not only statistical work&#13;
&#13;
but trying to understand what it meant for a country. Remember also that we were in the&#13;
&#13;
period of a great debt crisis of Latin America which saw the origins of the Paris Club, the&#13;
&#13;
London Club, the Hague Club, and Argentina, Brazil, one after the other, were facing&#13;
&#13;
problems not different from what they are facing today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sounds like it is very similar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Of course. And the response was in many ways similar in&#13;
&#13;
terms of looking at the total flow of resources, not only the debt payments but the&#13;
&#13;
package of reforms necessary in order to stabilize the economy, and also an injection of&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -27-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
money in a flexible form in order to make the package possible. So it was a response to&#13;
&#13;
circumstances of the time, which were similar in a way to some of the circumstances we&#13;
&#13;
find today, with not the same degree of severity, but posing the same questions.&#13;
&#13;
   Another aspect of the economic work is that this was a period where economists were&#13;
&#13;
also brought in on the. project development. [A.] David Knox, Mervyn [L.] Weiner,&#13;
&#13;
Warren [C.] Baum all economists moving into to head divisions of the Projects&#13;
&#13;
Department. Siem [Simon] Aldewereld as Director wanted to strengthen the economic&#13;
&#13;
analysis, the methodology on project work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm aware that at one time Irving Friedman sought to have all the economists&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank, including country economists and the economic advisers of the various area&#13;
&#13;
departments, think of themselves as part of some overall group of economists. As I&#13;
&#13;
understand it, that was not thought too well of in the Area departments. Would you&#13;
&#13;
comment on this aspect of the evolution of the economics group?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I don't think I can comment on this very much because that was a&#13;
&#13;
period where, as I said earlier, operational work and economic work were already well&#13;
&#13;
integrated in our Area. I don't think it was too different from the same issues confronted&#13;
&#13;
within the Projects Department or the Area departments before reorganization. There is&#13;
&#13;
always a certain amount of turf protection; that's part of the game. I don't think that was&#13;
&#13;
a major issue except in the minds of some.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you yourself participate in meetings ofthe Economic Committee&#13;
&#13;
from time to time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, yes, we had to participate, and certainly as Deputy Director I&#13;
&#13;
would always be there because we attached great importance to the integration of&#13;
&#13;
economic and operational work. Oh, yes, very much so, yes. And of course, one aspect&#13;
&#13;
is that the Bank was a much smaller organization. The Economic Committee and the&#13;
&#13;
Loan Committee played very different roles than they played in later years. In later&#13;
&#13;
years there's been more of a role of control to make sure that proposals are in conformity&#13;
&#13;
with Bank policies, procedures, that they do not miss anything. The guidance comes&#13;
&#13;
much earlier in the cycle of the work now than at that time of the Loan Committees.&#13;
&#13;
Then, it was too late to make many changes except to catch major mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  On the other hand, discussion in the Loan Committee exercised influence on future&#13;
&#13;
proposals. At that time, you had a group of people in the Loan Committee who were&#13;
&#13;
sitting there not simply representing the point of view of their own department, but as&#13;
&#13;
someone with general experience, with a good mind, who could comment on any aspect&#13;
&#13;
of the proposals. It was this teamwork which was very educational for the young staff.&#13;
&#13;
The Loan Committee was a good school at the time. As a young staff member you had&#13;
&#13;
the time to attend it. It was marvelous training. You learned from experienced people,&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
and learned a great deal, just like attending the meeting of Executive Directors at the&#13;
&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The general economics staff increased very substantially during this period of&#13;
&#13;
time. I think this was the beginning of the time when the economists began to do some&#13;
&#13;
general economic work that was not directly related to projects. I'm interested to know&#13;
&#13;
how the Area department people viewed this. To this day there are some people in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank who feel that the academic economic work is not so directly related to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, clearly there are still very different views today on that issue.&#13;
&#13;
My own view is that as an institution concerned with development, there is no doubt that&#13;
&#13;
the reputation of that institution depends on very high quality economic work in areas&#13;
&#13;
which are very fundamental to development, not necessarily the day-to-day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
operation. Clearly we are not supposed to do what universities can do better, but the&#13;
&#13;
Bank is in an extraordinary position to have access to information, comparative&#13;
&#13;
knowledge and to all the lessons of experience on a comparative basis. I'm more and&#13;
&#13;
more convinced of that every day. I talk to policy makers and make a recommendation to&#13;
&#13;
them. They ask, "Where has it worked before? Where has it failed and why? How&#13;
&#13;
relevant is it to our environment?" And this ability to speak from comparative experience&#13;
&#13;
to articulate the rationale for your recommendation, why you think it relevant to the&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -30-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
country concerned, is very critical in the ability to persuade. I think this is what we have&#13;
&#13;
missed in the Bank in not doing more of comparative analysis and perhaps a little too&#13;
&#13;
much of esoteric analysis in some cases of research. Leave it to others to do that and&#13;
&#13;
focus on what we have a comparative advantage in doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  So that was always my view. I was not opposed to doing more research. On the&#13;
&#13;
contrary, there's more economic work to be done centrally, but of a different kind,&#13;
&#13;
perhaps. I think perhaps it's the tendency to move away from what was directly relevant&#13;
&#13;
to Operations, which created a feeling on the part of some of us in the Operations&#13;
&#13;
departments, at a time when budget constraints became more severe you questioned the&#13;
&#13;
need to have more people in the central economic staff to do things which really are not&#13;
&#13;
of direct concern to you, when you need staff to go on some operational mission next&#13;
&#13;
week. I think this is what you have, this range of differences. And this is why the Bank&#13;
&#13;
set up the Research Committee, to rethink the direction of research in the Bank. I was a&#13;
&#13;
member the last year before I left.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand that Irving Friedman invited some people from the International&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund occasionally to sit in on meetings of the Economic Committee to make&#13;
&#13;
comments, particularly about macroeconomic and monetary policy. How was this&#13;
&#13;
viewed in the Bank? Or to put the question another way, how did people who were&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -31-&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
concerned with projects and at the very most with sectors, view the consideration of&#13;
&#13;
macroeconomic issues within the context of Bank operations?&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, again, you had a range of views on that. I think the&#13;
&#13;
economists welcomed it, recognizing that the relation of the two institutions were highly&#13;
&#13;
dependent on the individual concerned. The relations were better in some departments&#13;
&#13;
than they were in others. It was very fortunate in the Western Hemisphere Department&#13;
&#13;
that we had a very, very intimate relationship with the IMF at the working level and at&#13;
&#13;
the policy level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Now I think here you're touching on a very fundamental problem on which I'll just say&#13;
&#13;
a few words. That is, I think that one of the most difficult problems in this institution is&#13;
&#13;
to develop the tact of the possible, of being able to limit your objectives in a given time&#13;
&#13;
dimension and to recognize that at a given time any government can only do so many&#13;
&#13;
things, and what matters is to be able to do the most important things first. When an&#13;
&#13;
expert in any particular field--an economist, a power engineer--is asked to write a report,&#13;
&#13;
to make an appraisal of the project, he is guided by certain notions, acquired from past&#13;
&#13;
experience, of what an appraisal was, of what an acceptable standard should be, should&#13;
&#13;
look like. There are so many pigeon holes which must be filled, you must answer so&#13;
&#13;
many questions, the conditionality must be as comprehensive as possible.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -32-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
   And then when you manage the program, you have to recognize that a govermnent&#13;
&#13;
can only take a certain number of actions at the same time--increase producer prices,&#13;
&#13;
increase tariffs, adjust the price of some commodities, fire people from state&#13;
&#13;
enterprises -- so you have to prioritize, to decide. What can you do in the next month or&#13;
&#13;
year? What combination of actions, what sequence, what timing will ensure coherence of&#13;
&#13;
the program and maximize its chances of success?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So it is important in dealing with your colleagues to give this guidance very early, to&#13;
&#13;
indicate that while most actions recommended are desirable they are not all feasible. You&#13;
&#13;
must not wait until the report is finished and say, "You can't insist on this", or, "Instead,&#13;
&#13;
you should have thought of that."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There is a cost for changing reports when they have been processed far down the line&#13;
&#13;
and the staff have the impression they have wasted a lot of time. To be able to give early&#13;
&#13;
guidance on strategy in achieving development objectives is a very critical element of our&#13;
&#13;
operations. Unfortunately, as operations become more complex, communications are not&#13;
&#13;
as good as they used to be, and the integration of macroeconomic considerations in sector&#13;
&#13;
or project work becomes increasingly difficult. And therefore the reaction of different&#13;
&#13;
people is very different, depending how well this job is done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -33-&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
    I want to ask about the IDA Replenishments. I think a question follows naturally&#13;
&#13;
from what we've been talking about. When the economic people were asked to provide a&#13;
&#13;
rationale for determining which countries were IDA Replenishment countries and which&#13;
&#13;
were Bank-worthy countries, but in addition were trying to establish some limit for IDA&#13;
&#13;
Replenishment in a given time period, as I understand it, poverty was one criterion for an&#13;
&#13;
IDA- worthy country, but performance or probable performance was another which&#13;
&#13;
was in tum related to absorptive capacity. A country can absorb a great deal more if the&#13;
&#13;
aid is being well administered than if it's being badly administered. I wonder if you could&#13;
&#13;
say a word about this whole range of issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes. Well, again, this was one of George Woods' preoccupations.&#13;
&#13;
He felt very much that the poorest countries needed more resources. He worked very&#13;
&#13;
hard for the Replenishment. That was one of his disappointments not to have been able&#13;
&#13;
to obtain more. This is why he instituted the Grand Assize, in order to dramatize the&#13;
&#13;
problem, to sensitize the opinion ofleaders to the problem of the developing world. He&#13;
&#13;
also asked to review the criteria ofiDA. George Woods had a genuine concern for&#13;
&#13;
the poorest countries and suggested many initiatives for Africa in particular, such as the&#13;
&#13;
basic study on African agriculture, and the establishment of the first regional mission to&#13;
&#13;
help African countries in identifying and developing projects for Bank financing.&#13;
&#13;
Perhaps I'll pause just a moment on that particular point before I tum to the other.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -34-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
     In Africa, we had a bias towards lending, towards the kinds of projects that only&#13;
&#13;
expatriate interests could develop, because African countries at that time did not have the&#13;
&#13;
capability of preparing a projects that could meet the criteria of the Bank. The most&#13;
&#13;
important projects the Bank had financed in Africa were in the mining sector and in&#13;
&#13;
transport infrastructure related to mining, and so on. In 1968, when I came to the&#13;
&#13;
Western Africa Department, the Bank and IDA had financed only one agricultural project&#13;
&#13;
in West and Central Africa. The expansion of lending to Africa took place under&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's presidency, but this was made possible because George Woods&#13;
&#13;
recognized the importance of agriculture and education so critical for Africa, and also&#13;
&#13;
recognized the need to establish the two regional missions to help African countries&#13;
&#13;
generate projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You say regional lending or regional...?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: No, I said regional mission, which was a mission resident in&#13;
&#13;
the field which had the responsibility for a given Region. There was one mission in&#13;
&#13;
Abidjan for West Africa and one in Nairobi for East Africa. Their role was to help&#13;
&#13;
African governments to identify and prepare projects for external financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It was clearly more than a country mission?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                               -35-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: A regional mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: It would have been too expensive and not effective to have&#13;
&#13;
such a mission in each country, because at the Regional level we had a pool of resources&#13;
&#13;
which could be centralized. I was simply reemphasizing how much George Woods did&#13;
&#13;
for Africa. At the same time he was not able to establish very good rapport with the&#13;
&#13;
African countries because he was tough on performance. I remember a caucus meeting,&#13;
&#13;
with the whole of the governors of the African countries congregated at the time of the&#13;
&#13;
Annual Meeting of the Banl&lt;. They asked a question, the President responds, and he&#13;
&#13;
said, "You boys are not doing your homework." This was always this very tough direct&#13;
&#13;
language that he had with them. That was not popular at that time because on the view of&#13;
&#13;
most African officials the problems were not oftheir own making but essentially due to&#13;
&#13;
the policies of the outside world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did they object to a use of the word "boy"?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, yes, very much so, very much so. That was a cause&#13;
&#13;
celebre, I remember, of that particular meeting with the African governors.&#13;
&#13;
They always remember that particular word.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -36-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
   Returning to the committee reviewing IDA policies, the committee came up with a&#13;
&#13;
report which basically came to the same earlier conclusion: that performance, income,&#13;
&#13;
and size of the country should be the guiding criteria, recognizing however that small&#13;
&#13;
countries have more of a handicap in development than countries with large markets.&#13;
&#13;
The small country bias, as we call it, should be recognized in the allocation criteria.&#13;
&#13;
Again, performance, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mentioned that you were part of a committee that, I take it, reassessed, or&#13;
&#13;
at least assessed, the IDA performance criteria. Would you say a little bit about who was&#13;
&#13;
on that committee and ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, Ben [Benjamin B.] King was the head of the committee.&#13;
&#13;
There was Louis de Azcarate. There was also Bill [WilliamS.] Humphrey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And what year was this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: That must have been 1965 or 1966, I would think.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Another aspect of the thinking of George Woods at the time of his interest in&#13;
&#13;
channeling more resources to the poorest countries, and less to the richest, was the&#13;
&#13;
introduction of the so-called market rate of interest. Well, the industrial countries&#13;
&#13;
continued to borrow from us and at the time countries like Norway, Denmark, and Italy&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                   -37-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
were continuing to borrow from the Bani&lt;. It was very difficult to cut them off. There&#13;
&#13;
was no reason, since they had access to the market, that we should subsidize them. Let's&#13;
&#13;
charge a rate of interest which will be similar to market rates and then they can&#13;
&#13;
choose. If they are attaching value to our technical assistance, they'll come to the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
we'll have that; but if not, let them go to the market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember having to prepare a first draft of the policy on this issue. What I had&#13;
&#13;
argued myself was that in the case of a country like Norway we have more to learn from&#13;
&#13;
their experts on building dams than they have to learn from us, so why waste staff in&#13;
&#13;
Norway doing detailed project appraisal which we can use in Africa. It's not only a&#13;
&#13;
question of husbanding scarce financial resources, it's scarce human resources as well&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank should allocate to the neediest. So let's make it the market rate of&#13;
&#13;
interest, but let's not insist at the same time that industrial countries with sophisticated&#13;
&#13;
expert resources have to go through the same level of detailed appraisal of project, and so&#13;
&#13;
on. But that didn't fly. And so what happened, and it was easy to forecast, it forced&#13;
&#13;
countries, actually, out of Bank. Norway decided that well, ifthis is the case, if they&#13;
&#13;
have to find time to prepare appraisal reports for Bank, they would go to the market and&#13;
&#13;
not borrow from the Bank. That was the last time Norway borrowed from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And Norway, I take it, never felt short of international capital?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                   -38-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: No, no. Of course not. But the intent of George was right. This&#13;
&#13;
was George's instinct, it was the right one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it the question of Japan had come up and been resolved in the same way&#13;
&#13;
earlier?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: There were a number of countries which agreed readily that they&#13;
&#13;
would no longer come and have access to the Bank. Some were a little more reluctant to&#13;
&#13;
cut that relationship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were there other things about the Woods years that we should talk about&#13;
&#13;
before we move on to 1968 and your going to Africa?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, some of the things may come to mind later on; at the&#13;
&#13;
present time I think I've touched on what struck me as George Woods' major&#13;
&#13;
contribution, paving the way for what really Bob McNamara was able to do later on. I&#13;
&#13;
think it would have been much more difficult for Bob McNamara to come in and jump&#13;
&#13;
the stage that we went through, during the Woods period, and move as fast. I think this is&#13;
&#13;
the major contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The last question I can think of to ask: you were concerned primarily with&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and yet the problem areas the Bank was really dealing with at this time&#13;
&#13;
were elsewhere.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did the people in Latin America feel that they were slighted in some sense by&#13;
&#13;
the overall Bank in terms of quantity of funds available or in general consideration by the&#13;
&#13;
executive directors because they were not in need of...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Not really, because the needs of other areas for IDA were so&#13;
&#13;
much greater that the creditworthiness of Latin America at the time was still such that&#13;
&#13;
resources were not the major limitation of such countries as Bolivia, Haiti, Paraguay.&#13;
&#13;
We still had enough resources, resources were not constrained, so I don't think Latin&#13;
&#13;
America felt that very much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You had all the assistance from a central economics staff that you had any&#13;
&#13;
interest in having?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I think so, I think so. The environment for Latin America&#13;
&#13;
for the type of economic work that was being done, the attention which the management&#13;
&#13;
was giving to economic work, made it possible to attract people very easily, economists&#13;
&#13;
who had come to Latin America, the issues were interesting. One aspect of where more&#13;
&#13;
work was being done was also on the debt issue at that time, not only as I say to the&#13;
&#13;
statistics of debt but what role the Bank could play in dealing with the debt problem.&#13;
&#13;
And this was never satisfactorily resolved, because as professional economists in the&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -40-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Region, we knew that that was only one element of a broader picture. Like&#13;
&#13;
anything else, you could not take it in isolation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   But the industrial countries at the time were very leery of the Bank touching the&#13;
&#13;
debt problem. And the whole of the Bank, vis-a-vis the various clubs, the Paris Club&#13;
&#13;
and so on, was established fairly early. The Bank could act as secretariat, provide the&#13;
&#13;
basic information, at most make some recommendations as to what terms would be&#13;
&#13;
consistent with balance of payments regarding a country, but we were not going to be&#13;
&#13;
at the center of negotiations on debt rescheduling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Just an anecdote, referring to a sarcastic remark of an official of the French Treasury&#13;
&#13;
whom I visited much later, on the occasion of the Ghana debt dispute, where I provided&#13;
&#13;
good offices on behalf of the Bank and at the request of the Ghanaian Government. But&#13;
&#13;
it reflected an opinion which was held much before. And he said to me, "In the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank there's one thing you don't understand, and we know that difference very well.&#13;
&#13;
This is why French literature is so superior to English literature, because in France we&#13;
&#13;
don't confuse the different genders; in England Shakespeare does everything, tragedy,&#13;
&#13;
comedy. In France we have Racine and we have Moliere and you in the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
haven't learned that debt rescheduling is a tragedy, consultative groups are a comedy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Oh, that's marvelous.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: It's a good one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Thank you for remembering that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes, I remembered; it just came to mind. But I think debt&#13;
&#13;
rescheduling was an opportunity to settle other bilateral issues, which donors considered&#13;
&#13;
were not the business of the World Bank. And that was the frustration of not being able&#13;
&#13;
to get hold of that particular issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, may be move on to your experiences in Africa? You've already&#13;
&#13;
mentioned some of them, but we're now talking about post-1968, or essentially the&#13;
&#13;
McNamara years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Right. Well, perhaps ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: We might begin by your just identifying the various tasks that were&#13;
&#13;
put to you personally, the titles you had in these years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, the early years of our association with Africa, which&#13;
&#13;
started in 1968, the latter part of 1968, and until the reorganization of 1972, convinced&#13;
&#13;
me very much that reorganization was necessary. Because the early years were of&#13;
&#13;
frustration, of frustration because as manager, as director of the department, I didn't have&#13;
&#13;
control of the resources which permitted me to achieve certain results. Most resources&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -42-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIERI)&#13;
&#13;
were under the control of the Projects Department. And when it was a question of getting&#13;
&#13;
a staff member quickly to go to Chad to look at a rural development project, I was told,&#13;
&#13;
well, sorry, he's not free for two or three months because he's going to Brazil, or he's&#13;
&#13;
going to India. There was no way of knowing whether this was the case or not. I had to&#13;
&#13;
trust my colleague that this was the case. But I didn't have control over the resources.&#13;
&#13;
And it was very difficult to get people to go to Chad, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Now, this was the first part. The second frustration was that the Bank was an&#13;
&#13;
entirely new actor in Africa. We knew relatively little about Africa, and we were a new&#13;
&#13;
donor. Ninety percent of the financial resources came from the European Development&#13;
&#13;
Fund, the French Government, sometimes some bilateral lender. They had established&#13;
&#13;
themselves there, they had their practices, their procedures, not attaching much&#13;
&#13;
importance to performance. And when I ask myself whether we could have been much&#13;
&#13;
tougher on performance than we had been, maybe I am not yet sure ofthe answer. We&#13;
&#13;
had to establish our credibility, that we were very bona fide lender and to demonstrate&#13;
&#13;
that listening to our advice would yield long-term benefits. So we had to start with some&#13;
&#13;
projects sometimes which were not necessarily the highest priority, because most obvious&#13;
&#13;
priorities were already preempted by other donors. The first project in Upper Volta was a&#13;
&#13;
telecommunications project; surely agriculture was the higher priority, but&#13;
&#13;
telecommunications was the only project available. If we had waited until we were able&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -43-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
to help the government identify a project, we would not have been able to establish&#13;
&#13;
our credibility. And it was the lack of professional resources to do this legwork, to&#13;
&#13;
accelerate the identification of new lending opportunities, which was the greatest&#13;
&#13;
frustration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Why had that not come up in the Bank before as a problem for the Area&#13;
&#13;
departments, do you suppose?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I think it was more apparent in Africa because it's an area&#13;
&#13;
where we had done very little. Why? Because, after all, countries became&#13;
&#13;
independent in 1958, and became members of the Bank in 1963 only. So there was no&#13;
&#13;
real relation with them before. So it was very new. We had to do the legwork. While&#13;
&#13;
in Latin America we had made our first development loan to Chile in 1948, but for a&#13;
&#13;
long time information was there, we knew the project, we didn't have to do it. So these&#13;
&#13;
were the first projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  By 1972 things did change. We got hold of resources to do the work and we began to&#13;
&#13;
have established ourselves in the countries. Governments began to listen to us. And we&#13;
&#13;
began also to have an impact on the other organizations, like the European Development&#13;
&#13;
Fund, on performance and we were able to say that we had projects we were prepared to&#13;
&#13;
finance.       I remember a project in Mali where we were helping to develop an area on&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -44-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
one side of the Niger, the European Development Fund was doing it on the other side;&#13;
&#13;
there were different rates for credit, different producer prices, and so on and so on.&#13;
&#13;
There was no harmonization of policy; we were talking on different wave lengths to&#13;
&#13;
governments. We had to establish discipline. Now that was very tough because relations&#13;
&#13;
with the European institutions were fairly distant at that time. I had to spend a fair&#13;
&#13;
amount of time to try to pave the way to have better working relations, and in the&#13;
&#13;
course of time this developed. So this is the history of our first years in Africa. At the&#13;
&#13;
same time, I must say there was so much support from the top, from Bob McNamara, on&#13;
&#13;
anything touching Africa that we would overcome these difficulties. There was not a&#13;
&#13;
livestock expert [who] could speak French in the Bank, so we had to hire one. But&#13;
&#13;
before the 1972 reorganization, when Area departments had no authority over technical&#13;
&#13;
staff, our efforts were stymied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I would write a note to Bob McNamara and he would say, "Okay,&#13;
&#13;
you go ahead," but you had to bring up issues. The advantage you had was that, as&#13;
&#13;
Director, you would deal directly with him on Africa and he would give you support.&#13;
&#13;
You made a case, and he would help. And by ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When you're talking about McNamara giving support, do you mean to&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                               -45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
imply that Woods did not give support, or is it just that things had moved ahead to the&#13;
&#13;
point where you could undertake a great deal more?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Eugene Black asked Leonard Rist, the former director of the&#13;
&#13;
Economics Department, before the 1952 reorganization, to serve as liaison with the&#13;
&#13;
African governments prior to the creation of the Africa Department headed by Pierre&#13;
&#13;
Moussa. When Woods left, the Africa program was just beginning. He had given a lot&#13;
&#13;
of support in creating the two resident missions. We still had to wait for the work&#13;
&#13;
division to produce until headquarters could respond, so.... Woods did probably as much&#13;
&#13;
as he could do at that time. You see, he created the Resident Mission in Abidjan, which&#13;
&#13;
became so important in our operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So Africa was ready for ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: ... wasn't making progress because the groundwork had just&#13;
&#13;
been laid at the time. So looking back at Africa, I think the major problem has been the&#13;
&#13;
speed at which one could persuade the governments to change their policies, the speed at&#13;
&#13;
which you could change policies that basically consisted of taxing agriculture excessively&#13;
&#13;
to the benefits of the urban centers, because after independence they were the only&#13;
&#13;
vocal groups in the country to hold the government together. This was the elite in these&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -46-&#13;
&#13;
countries. And after all, the difference between world prices and producer prices was the&#13;
&#13;
only resource the country had for its budget, and saying that you have to increase&#13;
&#13;
producer prices meant where's the money going to come from to do the rest?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mean there isn't a well-developed system of income taxation in Mali?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: No, not quite. Not for some time, not for some time,&#13;
&#13;
unfortunately. I think these were basically the greatest difficulty and in addition the&#13;
&#13;
delivery of, the area of technical cooperation. And if today you speak to African&#13;
&#13;
countries, this is one area of criticism, that technical assistance has not fulfilled its role in&#13;
&#13;
terms of training, preparation of personnel, and so on. But these are perhaps the two&#13;
&#13;
frustrations: not to have had enough influence in policy and not to have been able to&#13;
&#13;
move quickly enough in building institutions which were the most sustainable. The rest,&#13;
&#13;
you know, the usual mistakes of projects and design, of not having the answer to some&#13;
&#13;
question we thought we had earlier, we just don't have them. And arid, semi-arid areas,&#13;
&#13;
the kind of packages which really succeed. There was not enough emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
agricultural research and- -which gradually also expanded under Bob McNamara--the&#13;
&#13;
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research ....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it that the conditions, soil, climate and so on, in Africa are sufficiently&#13;
&#13;
different that a fair amount of real research and experimentation...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Quite.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: .. .is needed and is still needed to this day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: A considerable amount of research has been done, but still&#13;
&#13;
there is need for much more. The fact is that there are very few crops where Africa has a&#13;
&#13;
real competitive advantage. Take oil palm. Yields are much higher in Malaysia than&#13;
&#13;
they ever will be in the Ivory Coast. Does it mean that the Bank should have only&#13;
&#13;
supported countries where it has the highest yield? Of course not. Ifthe project&#13;
&#13;
proposed is the best alternative in the country compared to other things, and still gives&#13;
&#13;
you an appropriate return... But this was also the issue we had to fight through with&#13;
&#13;
some of the donors. We had to fight it through the Department of Agriculture in the&#13;
&#13;
United States, which will tell you that for oil, palm income the yield is not high enough,&#13;
&#13;
it doesn't make sense, given the projection of prices and so on. And we had to develop&#13;
&#13;
some policies which provided a defensible rationale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   This was developed over time, but this is the basic intrinsic difficulty. If you&#13;
&#13;
consider cocoa, coffee, yes, you can grow it in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, with&#13;
&#13;
appropriate incentives. But then when you go up in the middle belt and the upper belt,&#13;
&#13;
you just don't have the answer. Senegal, even today, still produces rice at three to four&#13;
&#13;
times the cost of imported rice from Thailand. Can you have a long-term policy based on&#13;
&#13;
that differential? Are there ways of reducing costs and improving return? All these are&#13;
&#13;
areas where we don't have answers. And these have been the frustration of the work,&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                   -48-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
although I think we have tried to do rather simple things in West Africa. Look where&#13;
&#13;
there is a farmers' initiative and just try to remove the obstacles and look at the next stage&#13;
&#13;
afterwards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  You have to break through all the sociological problems. You can see projects, such as&#13;
&#13;
a project in northern Nigeria, a very interesting one, where on the productivity side you&#13;
&#13;
know the answer. It was a question of giving the incentives to induce farmers to harvest&#13;
&#13;
their cotton early so you still have time to add another crop during the season,&#13;
&#13;
immediately boosting income. But all the sociological environment was contrary to that,&#13;
&#13;
because the caste of traders would buy as late as possible to pay the lowest price&#13;
&#13;
possible to the farmer, and they refused to buy cotton, so that you needed to get into&#13;
&#13;
marketing and.to establish a market and buy. Then the transporter refused to transport it&#13;
&#13;
and you need get into the trucking business, and so on. But you ask yourself, you know,&#13;
&#13;
ten years from now, when the project is no longer run by a strong group of expatriates,&#13;
&#13;
the central government support falls back into the organization of the state. All the&#13;
&#13;
society hasn't changed in ten years, it's still there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes. Well, it was suggested to me by another conversation last week that&#13;
&#13;
some of the failures that have turned up in project evaluation have occurred in Africa,&#13;
&#13;
primarily African agriculture, and that this was in a way the fault ofthe Bank for not&#13;
&#13;
having had sociologists and/or anthropologists at work understanding more about the&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -49-&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
&#13;
traditions in the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: It's a very interesting question. I don't know how much you&#13;
&#13;
learn at the university in sociology, but at least you have an interest...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You learn the kinds of questions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Self awareness, the kind of questions you should be sensitive&#13;
&#13;
to. I insisted on organizing the first mission for agriculture in the newly created West&#13;
&#13;
Africa Department in 1968, with John [C.] de Wilde as head of it. (There was one prior&#13;
&#13;
mission on African agriculture, also headed by John Wilde, before the Department was&#13;
&#13;
created.) On his return he wrote a very sensitive, commonsense report on agriculture in&#13;
&#13;
Africa. I said to him that he should take people from outside the Bank who have relevant&#13;
&#13;
experience, and, goodness, take a sociologist. That was the first time we had a&#13;
&#13;
sociologist in Africa, a special mission. And he came back pointing to the things that one&#13;
&#13;
shouldn't do, recommending that one listen and look at local initiative, look at the reasons&#13;
&#13;
why it is not developing, that there must be some reason people do the same thing for&#13;
&#13;
year after year. But the one of my regrets working in Africa is that we have not been able&#13;
&#13;
to bridge the gap between what an institution like the Bank, which is working through&#13;
&#13;
government, and what the non-governmental organizations--NGOs--do by working&#13;
&#13;
at the village level. What the NGOs do shows a much greater understanding and&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -50-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
sensitivity to these sociological aspects. But it's small, it doesn't have large impact, it is&#13;
&#13;
not always replicable, and you, yourself, have to work through governments. You have&#13;
&#13;
to bridge the two.... I think is one area where, ifi had stayed longer in Africa, I would&#13;
&#13;
have attached a great deal of importance to trying to find solutions to that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I was reminded of this working last year in helping the Live Aid people, Bob Geldoff&#13;
&#13;
and his group, to allocate resources to Africa, vetting project and reviewing about a&#13;
&#13;
hundred a fifty projects in three weeks, making a judgment in two hours to see whether&#13;
&#13;
the project is go or no go. Well, in the Bank you would have two and a half years to look&#13;
&#13;
at a project. There must be something in between where ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think this is one of the points that Robert Ayers makes in his book, Banking&#13;
&#13;
on the Poor, ifi remember the title correctly. He was not writing specifically about&#13;
&#13;
Africa, but he indicated that a major problem of dealing particularly with poverty is that it&#13;
&#13;
is very difficult for the Bank people to deal directly with the people who are poor. There&#13;
&#13;
is always an intermediary who was beholden to the local government primarily, so that,&#13;
&#13;
unless the government as well as the Bank has a very strong incentive to deal with the&#13;
&#13;
problem, it may be that the Bank money will not get precisely where the Bank had hoped&#13;
&#13;
it would get.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: You have this and the understanding of what people actually&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -51-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
want. I made a practice whenever I went to Africa to visit all the development projects,&#13;
&#13;
meet the village chief, and when you get a group of villagers, always speak through the&#13;
&#13;
village chief, don't speak individually. So they talk and the village responds. I used to&#13;
&#13;
say to them, "All right, you have seen this first project. We are finished after five years.&#13;
&#13;
Your yields have increased, your incomes have increased, you seem to be happy with this&#13;
&#13;
project. What is the next stage?" And usually it was a construction of a little service&#13;
&#13;
center, with better seeds, some fertilizer, some technical assistance, and so on. And&#13;
&#13;
some feeder roads, whatever. And I'd say, "What do you want?" And then they come&#13;
&#13;
back and say that what they would like is to add another little building to put--always the&#13;
&#13;
same answer--transistor radios and bicycles. And so I would say, well, you know,&#13;
&#13;
we don't have much money, you can only build one little building so either you use it to&#13;
&#13;
store bicycles and transistor radios, or you can use it to teach the young farmers to repair&#13;
&#13;
the draft instruments that have been introduced in the first phase of the project. Instead&#13;
&#13;
of going into town, you can have a midwife who will come once a week to take care of&#13;
&#13;
your families. But the same answer always comes back--bicycles and transistor radios.&#13;
&#13;
So you say to yourself, who are you to design a project and say what these people want&#13;
&#13;
and need, you know? It's true, they need better health, surely; they need better education,&#13;
&#13;
surely; but their motivations are to do whatever they can do with their money next week.&#13;
&#13;
  Sometime the lack of sensitivity we can have in our procedure is we do not permit&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -52-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
them to finance bicycles. We are beginning to look at this, as to what really matters in&#13;
&#13;
influencing this motivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: But you learn over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well tell, if you will now, about Europe, Middle East and North Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: If I say that the years I spent in Africa, perhaps almost surely, the&#13;
&#13;
happiest in my professional career because this is where the development problems are&#13;
&#13;
the most intractable. I'm not going to talk about this now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  On the other hand, my years in the Middle East were extremely interesting for a great&#13;
&#13;
number of reasons. Programs were pretty well on the way, they didn't have the same&#13;
&#13;
amount of creativity, innovation, not trying to change procedure, not to adjust to the&#13;
&#13;
countries need, but the complex of historical, political, social, economic problems in that&#13;
&#13;
part of the world is of such complexity that it is difficult to acquire the tact of the&#13;
&#13;
possible. This was a real challenge of the job, to have developed the sensitivity to not&#13;
&#13;
bang your head against the wall but do the things which are possible, do them as quickly&#13;
&#13;
and as and well as you could.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -53-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Probably incite such a wealth of passion on the part of the inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: This aspect was particularly interesting for me as a European,&#13;
&#13;
because I don't think anywhere in the world do you find the weight of history so&#13;
&#13;
determinant in shaping attitudes today. You are sometimes baffled to find a reaction to a&#13;
&#13;
particular problem. Yet 500 years ago something happened there which is still not&#13;
&#13;
forgotten. And I think that these are the things that are.... And of course when you have&#13;
&#13;
the challenges of Lebanon, with all the height of interest from so many parts of the world&#13;
&#13;
in an area like this, it was certainly easier to handle than the development problems of&#13;
&#13;
Africa, which are so intractable, but far more difficult than many other areas, particularly&#13;
&#13;
in the area of the diplomacy of development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Now, I found great difficulty in organizing the work in the Region for the lending&#13;
&#13;
institution like the Bank. In Africa, you could identify a number of central themes which&#13;
&#13;
are common to activities in the area, around which you could organize your work, your&#13;
&#13;
staffing. You look ten years ahead. There are the kinds of people you would need on the&#13;
&#13;
staff, the skill mix. You know how to address these issues. Semi-arid Africa has a&#13;
&#13;
certain number of problems in agriculture, a new type of research must be done, which&#13;
&#13;
can be organized on a regional basis common to various countries.         In the Middle&#13;
&#13;
East, every country is different; every country is specific in its attitudes, needs, its&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -54-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
problem, and so on and so on. And therefore the variety of situations forces you as a&#13;
&#13;
manager to spread much more on a variety of issues than you do in Africa, and to be&#13;
&#13;
subjected to constant mental shifts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  There are also difficulties in that it is an area which is always in the limelight, always&#13;
&#13;
being shown, because of the implication, you know. You refuse to lend to Lebanon or&#13;
&#13;
you lend to Lebanon, everybody will look at it in particular, what does it mean? What's&#13;
&#13;
it mean in terms of influence exercised by the Bank and on the Bank? You have to be&#13;
&#13;
sensitive not only in what you do, but how it's perceived and how it looks from outside.&#13;
&#13;
I would say it requires in a way a bit more statesmanship, in the political sense, to deal&#13;
&#13;
effectively with them, to protect the institution, as well as being effective. These&#13;
&#13;
considerations are the main issues that I saw in my work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I think this is where I learned a number of things, too. One is that this is an area where&#13;
&#13;
the major role of the Bank is no longer in project lending, it is in policy-based lending,&#13;
&#13;
much more than in other areas. In Africa you still need to do project lending because&#13;
&#13;
countries cannot put a project together, there's discipline in project learning. Most&#13;
&#13;
countries in the Middle East and Europe can have consultants to do the work, but shaping&#13;
&#13;
a program of adjustment, shaping a program of development, coordinating with&#13;
&#13;
the Fund on structural adjustment is far more, and is a much greater role.&#13;
&amp;#12; CHAUFOURNIER                                 -55-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 (CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
 And of course they're particularly challenging at the time when these countries, at this&#13;
&#13;
 level of development, have felt very much the impact of a changing world, changing&#13;
&#13;
 relative prices, the price of oil, the impact it has on their economy, the price of capital and&#13;
&#13;
 so on. And the reconversion that you have to make is far greater than in other areas like&#13;
&#13;
 Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   And also because you have such a variety of political systems, and of economic&#13;
&#13;
 systems, completely free economics, market oriented, centrally planned economies, and&#13;
&#13;
 what I think has been particularly interesting for the Bank is that whatever the choices of&#13;
&#13;
 these countries, they are confronting these issues and basically the direction in which&#13;
&#13;
 they move is the same. It was not, therefore, too difficult for the Bank to respond to&#13;
&#13;
 these changes because there are no real differences in the direction of change. What you&#13;
&#13;
 had to do is to be far more sensitive to the way you were doing it, because, you know, as&#13;
&#13;
 China has done, it has a new economic program which means a fundamental change in&#13;
&#13;
 direction of policy and then at the end you have two sentences which say, and all this in&#13;
&#13;
Â·perfect conformity of Marxist-Leninist thought and the thought of Mao Tse-Tung. The&#13;
&#13;
 record is still there, freedom of the country, like Hungary had in moving away from&#13;
&#13;
 the COMECON, changes in policy are still consistent with whomever was there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   What I was simply trying to say is that you are dealing with countries which operate in&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                  -56-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
a given political context and political relation, you have to be sensitive to it because the&#13;
&#13;
appearance of reform is one thing, and real reform is also another thing. And you have&#13;
&#13;
to be sensitive to some limit, to some concern, the pace at which and the timing at which&#13;
&#13;
their decision.... I think this is the difficulty of working in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Well, perhaps we should stop here.      There are of course many other&#13;
&#13;
things to say, but...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I might just ask a word about Israel. Has it been difficult for the Bank in the&#13;
&#13;
Middle East because the many of the Middle Eastern states must surely have opposed&#13;
&#13;
loans to Israel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Israel has no longer been involved in the Bank for quite some&#13;
&#13;
time, simply because it reached an income level which disqualified it for loans. So the&#13;
&#13;
issue has not arisen. The issues are different. Still, in a world of suspicion, intentions&#13;
&#13;
are easily questioned on the part of an institution as on the part of an individual and&#13;
&#13;
therefore one must be very careful about perceptions of what you do, the way you do it,&#13;
&#13;
and be very clear and aboveboard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do the high per capita income Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and&#13;
&#13;
Kuwait ask for technical assistance?&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -57-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Yes. We have had very important programs in these countries&#13;
&#13;
at their request and it was done on the basis of reimbursable assistance so it doesn't cost&#13;
&#13;
the institution to service. Recognizing that they could pay for it, they shouldn't directly&#13;
&#13;
divert resources which others need. But we have provided that assistance.         We have&#13;
&#13;
had about a thirty man-year program of work in Saudi Arabia alone, essentially in the&#13;
&#13;
area of industrial development analysis projects, manpower training, review of some&#13;
&#13;
contracts at the time they felt the recycling of petrodollars was a little too fast, and so&#13;
&#13;
on and so on.    So we have had a very active relationship, but a relationship which the&#13;
&#13;
Bank provided not quid pro quo but which I think was appreciated and maintained a&#13;
&#13;
goodwill relation with them and in turn made it possible for the Bank to mobilize&#13;
&#13;
important resources in these countries in terms of funds.     So it has been, I think, quite a&#13;
&#13;
good relationship, and we have been helpful to them.       I think they've appreciated that.&#13;
&#13;
Not the most difficult part of the work, certainly much easier than the lending in other&#13;
&#13;
parts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  I think the difficulties the Bank has faced in this area is because of the world politics.&#13;
&#13;
Lending to Egypt and having an influence on policy in Egypt has been limited by the&#13;
&#13;
special relationship existing between the United States and Egypt.       We recognize the&#13;
&#13;
willingness of the United States to continue to lend very large amounts and the contacts&#13;
&#13;
like the Camp David Accord, and can understand the reasons for it, but it weakens the&#13;
&#13;
ability of an institution on economic grounds to insist on changes in policy.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -58-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
   I think it's a great tragedy that Egypt, the most populated country in the Arab world,&#13;
&#13;
has such a level of poverty for so much of its population, 40 million people, has not taken&#13;
&#13;
advantage of that window of opportunity which has existed the last few years to make&#13;
&#13;
changes in its economy which would stimulate its development; on the contrary, adopting&#13;
&#13;
pricing policies which just make the situation terribly, terribly worse. We have&#13;
&#13;
discussed this with authorities at the highest level, when we pointed it out to President&#13;
&#13;
Mubarak that at the present rate growth in the consumption of energy--fourteen percent&#13;
&#13;
per year--in the next five years it would have to double its installed capacity. That&#13;
&#13;
means in the next five years, build as much as Egypt has built in its total history. That's&#13;
&#13;
not possible. And it's this process of rapid deterioration which is coming to them so&#13;
&#13;
quickly that it's just not able to cope with. These are the tragedies of this country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it you feel they could cope with ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Of course they could cope with ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: ... with different policies?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: We have said, "We understand your problem. It cannot be done&#13;
&#13;
in any one year." We said, "Okay, you have ten years to bring the price of oil to the&#13;
&#13;
world price. Take ten years, do it gradually, year by year. Choose your timing. It&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -59-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
can't be done in one year." But now, second-guessing the political ability of government&#13;
&#13;
to do several things was dangerous but you know what the cost is of not doing it. I think&#13;
&#13;
the great frustration of working there is seeing enormous potential of that region, the&#13;
&#13;
beauty of that region and the wastage that politics brings about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I wonder if you would say a word about Algeria. I think the Bank got off to&#13;
&#13;
a difficult start in Algeria. It had a big mission and then made no loans. Is the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
relationship to Algeria now on very firm ground?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: You asked a question which is related to that: Does being a&#13;
&#13;
Frenchman make it easier or more difficult to work there? I will answer in this way on&#13;
&#13;
Algeria: I was apprehensive, given the past relation between France, always a little&#13;
&#13;
ambiguous, a little bit of ambivalence in its relations. What to do? I thought we'd just&#13;
&#13;
say to them what was right, what we thought was right.     That was that there were&#13;
&#13;
projects for which we loaned to show good will to Algeria. There were some mistakes&#13;
&#13;
made. The projects were not moving, the money wasn't moving, so why not go to the&#13;
&#13;
Government and say, "Look, wipe it off and start afresh. Do the thing which you want&#13;
&#13;
to do." I went to Algeria and said, "Look, what happened?" For two years, not only&#13;
&#13;
didn't we lend, but we cancelled $200 million. That doesn't win relations.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -60-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
The Algerian people are sophisticated people. They know what two and two is. It's&#13;
&#13;
four. And we started with a solid and healthy basis, so it's not the nationality, it's just&#13;
&#13;
being consistent, being creditable in your relation with this country. They know what to&#13;
&#13;
expect from you and where you stand on issues. If they do, you make progress. I think&#13;
&#13;
that was my experience in other countries. Being a Frenchman in Africa, the language,&#13;
&#13;
sure; the language we have together. We sat on the same benches at school, we have&#13;
&#13;
learned the same things. With a casual discussion we can relate to each other. That&#13;
&#13;
helps, surely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: African leaders of West Africa will know both Moliere and Racine?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: They will know the difference. They won't confuse les genres,&#13;
&#13;
as we say. That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But I take it that the French language was primarily a means of gaining&#13;
&#13;
their confidence. It wasn't because you came from France originally that you had a&#13;
&#13;
particular advantage?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, the French language. The Africans were my professors&#13;
&#13;
when I returned. I had worked for 16 years in Spanish and another few years in English&#13;
&#13;
and Spanish, and my French had suffered from it, so when I went back to Africa I found&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -61-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
some very good professors, far more literate than I was in French. I think I've improved&#13;
&#13;
since then, but that's very true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I think we're perhaps at the point where we should sum up. I&#13;
&#13;
would invite you to tell what you think are the highlights of your career and, if you will,&#13;
&#13;
your views of the three Presidents under whom you have served in whatever way you&#13;
&#13;
care to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Difficult question, because I dealt with the three Presidents&#13;
&#13;
in different capacities. The closest association was with Bob McNamara, basically&#13;
&#13;
because I worked in Africa, in an area to which he attached a great deal of importance,&#13;
&#13;
being on committees, on expressing other problems on the research and management,&#13;
&#13;
on personnel--much closer exposure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   I was a very young man at a very low level of responsibility under Eugene Black, and&#13;
&#13;
my recollection of those years was one of a kind of awe at the personality of Eugene&#13;
&#13;
Black and the senior officials of the Bank. There seemed to be such a distance between&#13;
&#13;
us, although in terms of attitude Gene was remarkably sensitive to the younger people in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, always a kind word, always supportive. You appeared at the Board meeting all&#13;
&#13;
trembling in front of directors who had been ministers of finance in their home country,&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -62-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
always supporting you and guiding you. A great person who had contributed&#13;
&#13;
so much to the prestige of the institution, to its visibility, a diplomat of development who&#13;
&#13;
would look at what he was doing on the Indus Basin and on the Iran dispute. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
was in the limelight. There were important issues worldwide, and you had confidence&#13;
&#13;
that you were in an institution which was respected, trusted, was evolving prudently, with&#13;
&#13;
a little bit of impatience in later years that it wasn't moving as fast as you would have&#13;
&#13;
liked as a professional economist, particularly someone trained in the social sciences.&#13;
&#13;
But it was an environment where you could discuss issues and express your views and&#13;
&#13;
little by little have the feeling that everybody had an influence in the Bank. But I was not&#13;
&#13;
close enough to Gene himselfto be able to say much more than this. He showed respect.&#13;
&#13;
He was a person who showed great consideration to people he was working with and the&#13;
&#13;
staff, and great leadership.&#13;
&#13;
   The main impression of all these Presidents was the presidential character of the&#13;
&#13;
institution. You expected leadership. You got it at times. This was the kind of&#13;
&#13;
leadership the Bank needed. You could have asked, perhaps, in the latter years of Gene&#13;
&#13;
Black that you would like to see the Bank move a little faster, but everybody came in&#13;
&#13;
time to power; George Woods came at a time when he could do things that couldn't have&#13;
&#13;
been done earlier.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -63-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
  Now, George Woods--I was impressed again by the personality of the man. Someone&#13;
&#13;
spoke of his great warmth. I think this is a good description because he had a warmth,&#13;
&#13;
but it expressed itself in very curious ways. If he had confidence in you, it was very good&#13;
&#13;
to work with him. He was decisive, he envisioned the problem, he was not encumbered&#13;
&#13;
with too many details, he went right to the fundamental issues and some vision and, as I&#13;
&#13;
said, he welcomed ideas, anything that was innovative, creative, he would at least look at&#13;
&#13;
it and discuss it and, if it was good, welcome it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I have to agree with his views since he promoted me to Deputy Director of the&#13;
&#13;
Western Hemisphere Department at a time when I was just about to leave the Bank&#13;
&#13;
because I was not sure that my future in the institution was. This was one thing that was&#13;
&#13;
very, very difficult to guess at the time: where you stood in the institution. When you&#13;
&#13;
compare to the practices of today when a manager is bound to meet with the staff and tell&#13;
&#13;
them, "This is what I expect from you," and at the end of the year, "This is what you have&#13;
&#13;
done, this is what I think of you, now what do you think?" This could never happen at&#13;
&#13;
the time, particularly since it was very difficult to sense, you know, where did you stand&#13;
&#13;
in the institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    For a non-native English-speaker it was tough at the beginning. It was tough. In an&#13;
&#13;
institution where you win your point by being very articulate about it, very persuasive,&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -64-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and to be able to express yourself with all the nuances, that was difficult. I remember&#13;
&#13;
there was a time when--it was under Gene Black--there were eleven Frenchmen in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and there were allegations of discrimination against Frenchmen. Now I remember&#13;
&#13;
Ronnie [Aaron] Broches at the time came to me and said, "Well, you'd better see the&#13;
&#13;
committee to review these allegations." But, you think of it, that wasn't news to me&#13;
&#13;
because I had frustrations as a young man not speaking English as fluently as I would&#13;
&#13;
have liked, for the staff, but the idea of discrimination didn't occur to me. But it is in that&#13;
&#13;
sense of people feeling they could not contribute all that they thought they could&#13;
&#13;
contribute with a better knowledge of the procedure and the language.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   But having said that, it was a small institution. Top management was very, very&#13;
&#13;
communicative, and looking back, after the point I became Director, I would see all my&#13;
&#13;
staff at least once a week. I would see my division chiefs several times a day. After the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization of 1972, three years later, I remember at Christmas time I hadn't seen&#13;
&#13;
many people. So I decided to tour the Region, and because there were people traveling, I&#13;
&#13;
saw two-thirds of the staff. It took me two days just to say hello. We just didn't adjust to&#13;
&#13;
our rapid growth, didn't set the counterweight which maintained the open communication&#13;
&#13;
that we had before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   And I think it is these early years ofthat open communication.... You felt, and the&#13;
&amp;#12; CHAUFOURNIER                                 -65-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 (CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 feedback would come from the top. You see, you attended Board meetings, you knew&#13;
&#13;
 what the President thought, how predictable he was on issues, and therefore you could&#13;
&#13;
 delegate much better than you could later on because of that sense of predictability, and&#13;
&#13;
 you didn't have the same exposure. And it was easier for me because I had moved up on&#13;
&#13;
 the scale, so my communication was at the top and I had learned how important it was&#13;
&#13;
 for me to communicate with my staff. Having gone through the early years, in the&#13;
&#13;
 position of the people down the line, I was able to appreciate a little more the frustration&#13;
&#13;
 which came out of that rapid growth where, as management, we have not responded as&#13;
&#13;
 we should have.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think this is to the credit ofTom [Alden W.] Clausen to have recognized that this was&#13;
&#13;
Â· very much a problem of the institution, that we have not corrected it as well as we could&#13;
&#13;
 have corrected it. We have been a little too perfectionist about it, I think, in trying to&#13;
&#13;
 correct the situation, when common sense and sensitivity would have done the job. We&#13;
&#13;
 have set up more procedures. We can have the best systems in place, but in the end it's&#13;
&#13;
 the people who manage the system that make the difference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 OLIVER: Well, surely to some extent the size of the organization makes for&#13;
&#13;
 some problems which cannot be solved.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                 -66-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Some can't, some can't. And one has to recognize this. At&#13;
&#13;
the same time, there are some which we have not been as successful and I recognize, as&#13;
&#13;
manager myself, I was not able to handle it as well as I should have. As I mentioned&#13;
&#13;
earlier, when I was secretary general of that group of students concerned with the&#13;
&#13;
problems of the French economy, most of the members of the group became active in&#13;
&#13;
politics later on. They became ministers and journalists. I asked myself at the time&#13;
&#13;
whether a political career was the best way to play a role in development. I would say&#13;
&#13;
looking back I would not have done anything different from what I've done in this&#13;
&#13;
institution. Personally, I've found what professionally, intellectually and emotionally I&#13;
&#13;
wanted to do: to be of service for a cause in which I believe, which is important, and&#13;
&#13;
done it with a kind of professional independence which is unmatched, without the&#13;
&#13;
servitude and the restrictions that you have in political life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sounds to me like it was a fortunate thing for you and also for the&#13;
&#13;
Bank that you were promoted to Deputy Director of the Western Hemisphere&#13;
&#13;
Department precisely when you were, or at least not later than that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Is there anything I should have asked you and I haven't asked?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: There are so many things in this institution which have, which ....&#13;
&#13;
I'll comment another time in terms of management, in terms of relation, in terms of how&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -67-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
decisions are made, in terms of ideas developed, particularly under the McNamara&#13;
&#13;
period, how we got it, how we did it, how we got Bob McNamara to do it. These are&#13;
&#13;
very interesting, they show light about how things develop in an institution like this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: If you're willing to give another ten minutes to tell that I think we'd better to&#13;
&#13;
do it now and make sure it's on the tape.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Well, I can take one incident as an example of how ideas develop.&#13;
&#13;
I was a member of the IDA review committee under George Woods, which I mentioned&#13;
&#13;
earlier. Luis de Azcarate, who had worked on Africa, said, "If we are looking at whether&#13;
&#13;
IDA should finance other activities than what we have been traditionally financing, why&#13;
&#13;
not health?" And he added, "Look, in Africa there is a disease called onchocerchiasis-&#13;
&#13;
river blindness--which affects such a large part of the population in an area which is the&#13;
&#13;
most productive area of Africa, in the river valleys, so that people have to migrate to the&#13;
&#13;
plateau where they can eke a very meager livelihood. And here you can establish a very&#13;
&#13;
direct link between health and development. Why not look at it?" I was struck by that, I&#13;
&#13;
got interested, I heard more about river blindness and talked about it. Finally, this&#13;
&#13;
disappeared in the last version of the report, so no health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  And when I came to Africa I was again struck by the problem so I asked Jacques&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -68-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
Crosnier, who was a medical doctor but who was working in education and agriculture at&#13;
&#13;
the time, to look at the health problem in Africa. He put a little think piece together. I&#13;
&#13;
said the only way we could move into health would be to demonstrate the clear link there&#13;
&#13;
was with development. And he put together a few ideas; for instance that the working&#13;
&#13;
life of an African farmer was about half of the working life of a Latin American, so you&#13;
&#13;
had a very high dependency ratio of population, with a small productive population.&#13;
&#13;
And so on and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 We worked on the idea, and Marc Bazin, who was then the chief of the division&#13;
&#13;
covering Upper Volta, said, "Well, when we organize the next visit of Bob McNamara to&#13;
&#13;
Upper Volta, let's take him there to these villages to get a visual perception of the&#13;
&#13;
problem. The head of the group who does research and started a small program of&#13;
&#13;
control is there and will take him to a village where the disease has been controlled.&#13;
&#13;
Let's listen to him for one hour."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 We organized the visit.    And we finished the day there and Bob said, "What have you&#13;
&#13;
been waiting for to get into this program?" A month later a greatly expanded program&#13;
&#13;
was organized and we had six organizations, seven countries together and money was&#13;
&#13;
raised, $60 million, for control. This is how we began to get into health. And one thing&#13;
&#13;
led to another.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                   -69-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did health come before nutrition, or nutrition before health, or did they&#13;
&#13;
come simultaneously?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Ahah. It's true all these ideas came together at the same time as one&#13;
&#13;
thing led to another. We are looking at the problems of absolute poverty, without&#13;
&#13;
leaving out disease. They are nutrition, they are education. And the time was right.&#13;
&#13;
But it was just one--the time had to be right and then you have to build your case and&#13;
&#13;
document it. That was the great thing about Bob, like George Woods: you had a rational&#13;
&#13;
argument, there it was, so that's the thing to do, let's do it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, it took, in a way, the recognition of the concept of human capital,&#13;
&#13;
which occurs in the sixties, first with education I think ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: ... and then once you recognized that healthy people are more productive than&#13;
&#13;
unhealthy people, and educated people are more productive than uneducated people, then&#13;
&#13;
the whole area of human services becomes relevant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: The logic is there. That's right. My other recollection of a&#13;
&#13;
particularly interesting time for me, I think an important time, was when we went through&#13;

&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
a low in the morale of the institution to the point where the Staff Association sent a&#13;
&#13;
memorandum to Bob McNamara laying down all the complaints that they were&#13;
&#13;
perceiving among the staff. And Bob was so shocked by this that he said, "Let's look&#13;
&#13;
into it." So he asked Peter Cargill, who was then the senior Vice President, to look into&#13;
&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Ernie Stem was away, he was traveling, so I inherited the task. Cargill said, "Well,&#13;
&#13;
Roger, you get this assignment. You go around to all the Regions, all the units, and talk&#13;
&#13;
to people and make a report." And Peter Cargill has a heart attack in the middle, so I&#13;
&#13;
inherited the task and I completed it. And then I had several lunches with Bob reporting&#13;
&#13;
to him what was my assessment. There were some very fascinating little vignettes&#13;
&#13;
of his reaction to how the system operated and its influence on attitudes. I learned a great&#13;
&#13;
deal from that and it later influenced my own style of management, my role as a member&#13;
&#13;
of the Personnel Management Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was there something about McNamara's style of management that gave&#13;
&#13;
the impression to staff that he did not care as much about staff as he&#13;
&#13;
should have?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I'm very hesitant about talking about the period of McNamara,&#13;
&#13;
which is so close.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -71-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: I'm very fond of him as a man. I don't want to play professional&#13;
&#13;
psychologist in analyzing people, but Peter Drucker once made a comment which I&#13;
&#13;
thought was quite perceptive. He said, "One of the problems that you find is that&#13;
&#13;
McNamara has essentially a written culture, a way of communicating with others, not&#13;
&#13;
an oral communicator." But once you have learned that, yes, you can communicate.&#13;
&#13;
You have to write in order to do it. I would send him a memorandum. He would scribble&#13;
&#13;
back on the margin and send it back to me, I'd scribble and send it back to him. You&#13;
&#13;
know, that's his style. You adjust to it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I was fortunate in my relations with McNamara. During the first week after he joined&#13;
&#13;
the Bank--I was then Deputy Director of the Western Hemisphere Department--my&#13;
&#13;
director was traveling, and I got a call from McNamara early in the morning, asking me&#13;
&#13;
to come to see him. It was the first time I had seen him, I had never seen him before. It&#13;
&#13;
was April1968.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    He said, "Roger, I have received an invitation from the International Press&#13;
&#13;
Association. I'm going to make a speech in Buenos Aires. Here is what I'm going to&#13;
&#13;
say. What do you think of it?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   I was there with William Clark, who was then the External Relations Director.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -72-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Bob, I can give you my reaction to the gist of what you say, but I can only&#13;
&#13;
comment on the speech if you show it to me. He said, "That's truly what I'm going to&#13;
&#13;
say. I'm going to talk about population problems and family planning."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   So I said, "Well, the reason why I would like to see your speech is that I think, one,&#13;
&#13;
this is a time for someone to show leadership on this issue. You'll find that many&#13;
&#13;
presidents of developing countries, many high officials in Latin America, will not want to&#13;
&#13;
touch it but they will welcome somebody to show some leadership on the subject.&#13;
&#13;
Having said that, it is such a sensitive issue that choosing Buenos Aires to do it can&#13;
&#13;
easily look as a provocation. You want to be effective, you want to communicate a&#13;
&#13;
message effectively. The way you say it is as important as what you say, and this is why&#13;
&#13;
I would like to see the text".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   He said, "Well, you gave your impression, thank you very much." Clark walks out&#13;
&#13;
and I followed him. As I reached the door McNamara said, "Roger, come here a minute&#13;
&#13;
and sit. You know, you did something very important, I don't know Latin America; I've&#13;
&#13;
met only a few generals when I was in the Pentagon and what struck me was how&#13;
&#13;
emotional they can be." And he said, "I have very great difficulty dealing with this&#13;
&#13;
situation. I'm not sensitive to it, but you are. And you owe it to me to warn me of these&#13;
&#13;
things, so I count on you."&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAUFOURNIER                                -73-&#13;
&#13;
(CHAUFOURNIER)&#13;
&#13;
   And I always remembered. And I was very much guided by this, there is a man&#13;
&#13;
with a capacity to know some of his own limitations, who was willing to share them&#13;
&#13;
with you. It was a personal lesson in management which I tried to practice later. The&#13;
&#13;
importance of sharing the knowledge of your limitations with your associates and to&#13;
&#13;
build on their own strengths.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did he show you the speech?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAUFOURNIER: Oh, yes, afterward I saw the speech. And every time he went&#13;
&#13;
to Africa we traveled extensively together and I always kept the recollection of this first&#13;
&#13;
discussion very much in mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's fascinating. Well, I have no more questions. Thank you&#13;
&#13;
very much.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Roger A. Chaufournier held on July 22, 1986
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In July 1986, Roger A. Chaufournier was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1952-1984, Mr. Chaufournier worked in the
            following areas: in the department of operations as an
            economist for the western hemisphere (1952-1956), as a
            senior loan officer (1960-1963), and as deputy director
            (1964-1968); in Peru as a resident representative of
            resident mission (1956-1957); in the department of
            operations, Europe, as a senior loan officer (1963-1964); in
            the western Africa department as director (1968-1972) and as
            vice president (1972-1977); and in the Europe, Middle East
            and North Africa region as vice president (1977-1984). While
            at the World Bank, his economic work laid a foundation for
            judgment on member countries, influenced the mission and
            economic surveys done once every three years, and correlated
            with lending decisions and the provisions by the World Bank
            for technical assistance to member countries. His transcript
            concerns the relationship of economic and operational work,
            the alliance for progress between the United States and
            Latin America in 1961, the International Development
            Association (IDA), and the reasons for the frustrations in
            the early association of the World Bank with Africa.
