FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.     The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning   programs.    They  include   several  country  and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis  and  research,   and  on  reports  of  other  organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.        The&#13;
papers   are   the   work   of   individuaLs   and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
Because of decline in fertility, population growth has been&#13;
declining in Brazil and Colombia since the mid-1960s and in Mexico since&#13;
the mid-1970s. The rapidity of the declines is one of the most striking&#13;
similarities among the three countries. They also had similar levels of&#13;
urbanization, life expectancy, and female literacy, but they differed in&#13;
the way in which their population policies evolved. Colombia, with the&#13;
highest initial fertility and most rapid decline, was the earliest to&#13;
organize large-scale family planning.     In Mexico, the onset of rapid&#13;
fertility decline coincided with a major change in national policy on&#13;
public support of family planning.       Brazil did not have a national&#13;
population program, though the use of contraceptives spread through&#13;
private commercial channels as well as through privately organized&#13;
family planning programs.&#13;
The paper examines the determinants of the onset and spread of&#13;
fertility decline in each country and concludes that both supply and&#13;
demand factors contributed    to their acceleration.     Analysis of the&#13;
proximate determinants of fertility indicates increased use of effective&#13;
contraceptives as the main contributor on the supply side.      Demand was&#13;
important because the fertility decline was also related to increased&#13;
economic pressures on lower income classes.      Overall, the decline in&#13;
fertility has accelerated because it has spread to these income groups.&#13;

Condense&#13;
La baisse de la fecondit6 a entrain6 un ralentissement de la&#13;
croissance d6mographique au Bresil et en Colombie des le milieu des&#13;
annees 60, et au Mexique depuis le milieu des annees 70. L'une des res-&#13;
semblances les plus frappantes entre les trois pays, qui avaient par ail-&#13;
leurs des niveaux similaires d'urbanisation, d'esperance de vie et d'al-&#13;
phabetisation des femmes, r6side dans la rapidite de ce ralentissement.&#13;
Cependant, leur politique demographique a evolue de facon fort diff6rente.&#13;
La Colombie, qui avait au depart le taux de f6condite le plus elev6 et a&#13;
enregistre la baisse la plus rapide, a ete la premiere a mettre en place&#13;
des services de planning familial a vaste echelle. Au Mexique, la baisse&#13;
rapide de la fecondite a coincid6 avec un changement majeur dans la posi-&#13;
tion des pouvoirs publics touchant l'appui au planning familial. Le&#13;
Br6sil n'avait pas de programme national de population, mais l'emploi de&#13;
contraceptifs s'est 6tendu par les circuits commerciaux prives et grace a&#13;
des programmes de planning familial priv6s.&#13;
Le document examine les facteurs qui ont determin6 le declenche-&#13;
ment et la g6neralisation de la baisse de la f6condit6 dans chaque pays et&#13;
conclut que l'offre et la demande ont toutes deux joue un r6le dans l'ac-&#13;
cel6ration du processus. Du cot6 de l'offre, l'analyse des determinants&#13;
imm6diats de la fecondite fait ressortir que le recours accru a des con-&#13;
traceptifs efficaces a joue un r6le cl1. La demande n'est pas a negliger&#13;
non plus, puisque le recul de la fecondite est lie a l'intensification des&#13;
pressions economiques sur les classes a faible revenu. Dans 1'ensemble,&#13;
la baisse de la f6condite s'est acceler6e parce qu'elle s'est 6tendue a&#13;
ces groupes de revenu.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En raz6n de los mas bajos niveles de fecundidad, el crecimiento&#13;
de la poblaci6n ha disminuido en el Brasil y Colombia desde mediados del&#13;
decenio de 1960, y en M6xico desde mediados del de 1970.          Una de las&#13;
similitudes   mais  notables  entre  dichos  paises   es  la  rapidez  de   la&#13;
disminuci6n registrada en cada uno de      ellos.   Los  tres  tenian  ademas&#13;
niveles similares de urbanizaci6n, esperanza de vida y alfabetizaci6n&#13;
femenina, pero diferian en la manera en que evolucionaron sus respectivas&#13;
politicas de poblaci6n.    Colombia, donde habia el mAs alto nivel inicial&#13;
de fecundidad y se registr6 la disminuci6n mAs rapida, fue el primero en&#13;
organizar  la   planificaci6n  familiar  en  gran   escala.   En  Mexico,  el&#13;
comienzo  de  la rapida   disminuci6n de   la  fecundidad  coincidi6   con un&#13;
importante cambio de la politica nacional en cuanto al apoyo del sector&#13;
publico a la planificaci6n familiar.      El Brasil   no  tenia  un  programa&#13;
nacional de poblaci6n, pero el uso de anticonceptivos se difundi6 a traves&#13;
de conductos comerciales privados, asi como de programas de planificaci6n&#13;
familiar organizados privadamente.&#13;
En el documento se examinan los elementos determinantes del&#13;
comienzo y difusi6n del descenso de la fecundidad en cada pais y se Ilega&#13;
a  la  conclusi6n   de  que   los  factores  de   la  oferta   y  la  demanda&#13;
contribuyeron a su aceleraci6n.     El anAlisis de las causas inmediatas de&#13;
la fecundidad revela un uso acrecentado de anticonceptivos eficaces como&#13;
el factor principal desde el punto de vista de la oferta.          La demanda&#13;
revisti6 importancia puesto que la disminuci6n de la fecundidad estuvo&#13;
relacionada tambien con las mayores presiones econ6micas sobre los grupos&#13;
de ingresos mas bajos.   En conjunto, la disminuci6n de la fecundidad se ha&#13;
acelerado porque ha llegado a estos grupos.&#13;

Introduction.1&#13;
Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia account for 60 percent of Latin America's&#13;
total population of 390 million people, and 63 percent of its 12 million&#13;
annual  births.   All  three have experienced very rapid rates of population&#13;
growth during the last three decades.      Average annual rates accelerated to&#13;
levels of 3 percent or more during the 1950s and 1960s, when death rates had&#13;
declined but birth rates remained high. Since the mid-1960s growth rates have&#13;
been falling in Brazil and Colombia as a result of declines in fertility, with&#13;
Mexico following in the mid-1970s.      One of the most striking similarities&#13;
among the three countries is the rapidity of these fertility declines (see&#13;
Table 1 for comparative demographic and socio-economic measures).         By the&#13;
early 1980s, Colombia's birth rate was 29 per thousand, compared to 46 in&#13;
early  1960s.    Brazil's was 30,    as  against 43   per  thousand,   while  the&#13;
corresponding figures for Mexico were 32 and 45 per thousand.&#13;
All three countries have official population policies, but differ as to&#13;
when the policy was adopted and in the nature of the policy.        According to&#13;
Nortman (1982), Colombia and Mexico have official policies to reduce their&#13;
population growth rates and to support family planning for thavu purpose, while&#13;
Brazil is listed as supporting family planning for other purposes.      Colombia&#13;
adopted its official policy in 1970, but had been very permissive toward&#13;
private sector and international agency support of family planning in the&#13;
years prior to establishing a national policy.     Mexico adopted its policy at&#13;
the end of 1973.      This was an abrupt shift from its earlier pronatalist&#13;
position,  which had   been quite restrictive   about outside support  of family&#13;

planning.  Since then it has established a National Population Council charged&#13;
with stabilizing population growth, set specific growth targets, and moved&#13;
vigorously to build a network of family planning clinics.&#13;
Brazil incorporated a population policy statement in a 1974 National&#13;
Development Plan.    It called for an assessment of the social and economic&#13;
impact of demographic factors, but stopped short of admitting to the need for&#13;
control of population growth or providing federal govermient support for&#13;
family  planning  programs.    Brazil  has been permissive    about private and&#13;
international agency support for family planning.     Several state goverrnments&#13;
have established programs in cooperation with those agencies.      In Brazil, as&#13;
well as Mexico and Colombia, private commercial sales of contraceptives and&#13;
private sector physicians have played an important role in making family&#13;
planning available to middle and upper income class urban couples.&#13;
Explaining Recent Fertility Declines.&#13;
The recent rapid declines of fertility in these three countries raise two&#13;
basic questions.   First, why did birth rates remain so high until the middle&#13;
1960s (for Mexico, the middle 1970s), even though all three by then had&#13;
achieved significant levels of urbanization and advancement on other scales of&#13;
modernization such as per capita income, education, and life expectancy?&#13;
Second,   what  social   and  economic   changes,   combined  with   changes   in&#13;
reproductive attitudes and practices, led to declines in fertility that appear&#13;
to be as rapid, or even more so, than the declines in mortality that occurred&#13;
a few decades earlier?     Are we witnessing a Latin American variant of the&#13;
European demographic transition?    Or does this experience represent something&#13;
new in terms of the relation between demographic and socio-economic variables?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
There has been considerable skepticism about the applicab.ility of the&#13;
European transition model to Latin American experience. Arriaga '1970) wrote:&#13;
The European fertility-morta7ity pattern could not have been repeated in&#13;
Latin America between 1930 and 1960 principally because za the shorter&#13;
period of time allowed for change in the latter. In addit on, a decline&#13;
in fertility in response to falling mortality was hampered by the&#13;
particular social, cultural , educational , and economic characteristics&#13;
of Latin American Countries0&#13;
Coale (1978), writing on the relation between population and development in&#13;
Mexico, added:&#13;
The Mexican experience must also be viewed as paradoxical For those who&#13;
hold the optimistic position that countries with rapid popV,ation growth&#13;
need have no concern about it, because social       and economic progress&#13;
automatically bring down birth rates0 . .      The Mexican population in&#13;
1975 was more than 72 percent literate and more than 60 Dercent urban,&#13;
the per capita income had nearly doubled in 20 years, the expectation of&#13;
life had risen to about 65 years and was still increasing; nevertheless,&#13;
fertility until 1975 was, if anything, higher than it was 20 years&#13;
before.&#13;
While most commentators agreed that the Latin American context betw^een 1940&#13;
and  1970   was  too  complex   to  allow  a  straight-forward   application  of&#13;
demographic transition theory to the question of when and how fertility would&#13;
decline, not all were as skeptical of its validity as Arriaga and Coale.&#13;
Beaver (1975) and Oeschsli and Kirk (1975) argued that the theory did yield&#13;
generalizations that were applicable to Latin America.     Each examined a wide&#13;
range of social and economic indicators associated with modernization.&#13;
Oechsli and Kirk predicted that a number of countries in the region were on&#13;
the threshold of very rapid fertility decline by 19600 Beaver pestulated that&#13;
once fertility decline was underway, it would be at least as rapid as the&#13;
decline in mortality.&#13;
Coale  himself  argued  that  a broader   view  of  trans1ition  theory  was&#13;
needed.   In a review of the theory (1975), he concluded that three broad&#13;
generalizations relevant to developing countries could be derived from the&#13;
theory.   They are the conditions required for onset of a fert,i;ity decline:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
(1) That fertility must be within the calculus of conscious individual choice&#13;
(as opposed to biological limitations or social mechanisms that affect&#13;
fertility); (2) That fertility reduction must be perceived as advantageous by&#13;
individuals making reproductive choices; and (3) That effective means of&#13;
fertility control must be available.    If recent fertility declines in Brazil,&#13;
Colombia, and Mexico represent a demographic transition defined in Coale's&#13;
terms, then one should be able to explain the persistence of high fertility&#13;
until the mid-1960s as well as the shift to rapid fertility decline after that&#13;
in terms (1) of the absence of one or more of the conditions with respect to&#13;
broad segments of their populations until about 1965, and (2) of changes in&#13;
one or more of the conditions since then.   Stating these questions in terms of&#13;
Coale's conditions raises further questions about how they relate to each&#13;
other: i.e., is any one of the conditions both a necessary and a sufficient&#13;
condition for fertility decline? For example, motivation would appear to be a&#13;
necessary condition, but not sufficient without access to the means to&#13;
control.    Access could also be a necessary condition,      bu.t not sufficient&#13;
without motivation.&#13;
At least two scenarios suggest themselves. One is that there was pent-up&#13;
demand in these societies for smaller families, but it was not realized&#13;
because access to the means of fertility control was limited. It was realized&#13;
when the means finally did become more widely available.        For purposes of&#13;
discussion,  label  the supply   access condition as hypothesis A.       Another&#13;
possibility is that one or both of the other two conditions changed. That is,&#13;
in addition to changes in supply (necessary condition), there were also&#13;
changes either in the degree to which couples were thinking about        smaller&#13;
families and what they could do to achieve them (Coale's calculus of conscious&#13;
choice) or in the relative advantages and disadvantages of smaller versus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
larger families, or both.     Label the motivation condition as hypothesis B.&#13;
While birth control consciousness can be conceptualized as a separate&#13;
hypothesis, it is more likely that changes in this condition twiould accompany&#13;
increased access to family planning or increased motivation, or a combination&#13;
of both. For this reason, we do not consider it as a separate f.ypothesis.&#13;
When one examines conditions during the 1960s and changes that have&#13;
occurred since at the national level, there is a strong prima facie case for&#13;
hypothesis A. By 1960, these countries had achieved comparatively high levels&#13;
on modernization scales that social scientists had been using to measure the&#13;
"demand"  side of fertility:     urbanization,   life expectancy, literacy and&#13;
educational  attairnent.   What was perplexing to so many observers was the&#13;
persistence  of high   fertility  rates in the face of such high levels of&#13;
apparent modernization.&#13;
The paper will suggest that the persistence of high fertility is much&#13;
less difficult to understand if one pays attention (1) to distribution as well&#13;
as the level of achievement of modernization variables and (2) to differences&#13;
in the impact of macro-level socioeconomic changes on different groups which&#13;
had high fertility prior to 1965 but experienced decline after.      In 1960, as&#13;
well as 1980, national averages masked significant rural-urban, regional and&#13;
socio-economic class differentials in fertility and other demographic models&#13;
in all three countries. Fertility had begun to decline in the `;odern" groups&#13;
and regions, but remained high for those who had not participated as much in&#13;
the modernization process0 National level fertility declines ocCurred because&#13;
lower fertility spread to lower inccme classes0&#13;
The distribution issue requires us to refine hypotheses A and B0         In&#13;
hypothesis A, the question is whether there was pent-up demand for smaller&#13;
families among lower socio-economic classes which limited access to family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
plannning prevented them from realizing.     In hypothesis B, two variants are&#13;
possible: (BI) Was it that in addition to increased access, there was also&#13;
mobility  from  lower to higher status groups,      so while  class differences&#13;
remained, the weight of lower class groups in the total diminished?       and/or&#13;
(B2) Did economic conditions affecting the reproductive motivation of lower&#13;
class groups change, so that there was more to be gained (and possibly greater&#13;
awareness of that gain) by controlling fertility during the 1970s than in the&#13;
1960s?&#13;
Fertility Trends Since 1965.&#13;
Neither Brazil, Colombia, nor Mexico have vital statistics systems that&#13;
are reliable enough to provide accurate measurement of the timing and&#13;
magnitude of recent fertility declines.      The National Academy of Sciences'&#13;
Committee on Population and Demography has published indirect fertility&#13;
estimates covering the period from the mid-1960s to late-1970s for Brazil and&#13;
Colombia, and similar information is available for Mexico.      Table 2 presents&#13;
estimates of the total fertility rate (TFR) derived from infonration in the&#13;
1960 censuses, summary estimates from the National Academy for the mid-1960s&#13;
to late 1970s, as well as estimates for around 1980 that have recently become&#13;
available.2&#13;
All three countries had TFRs that were 6 or more in the early 1960s.&#13;
Brazil appears to have been the first to start a decline: its TFR was already&#13;
lower than 6 in 1965, though the exact date of the onset of the decline is&#13;
difficult to establish because estimates for the 1960s are based on&#13;
retrospective reports in census and survey data from the 1970's. These are&#13;

reports of its 1982 national demographic survey.&#13;
Around 1960 to around 1980.&#13;
subject to a variety of errors that affect timing.     By 1980, Brazil's TFR had&#13;
fallen 31 percent, and there were nearly 2 fewer births per woman than in&#13;
1960.&#13;
Colombia had the highest TFR among the three countries in the early&#13;
1960s.   According to the National Academy of Sciences, its decline did not&#13;
start until  the middle of the 1960s; once underway, the decrease was even&#13;
greater than in Brazil.   By 1980, Colombia's TFR was 3.8, which represented 3&#13;
fewer births per woman than in 1960,   The onset of fertility decline in Mexico&#13;
came still later, some time during the early 1970s, since total fertility was&#13;
still well over 6 in 1970.     A decline of nearly 40 percent occurred between&#13;
1970 and 1980 (total fertility increased during the 1960s), indicating that&#13;
the pace of decline is even more rapid than in Colombia and Brazil.      In both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Colombia   and  Mexico,  the  onset   of  fertility  decline   appears  to  have&#13;
anticipated by a short time the establishment of large scale organized family&#13;
planning efforts, both private and government sponsored, but accelerated as&#13;
those programs gained momentum.     In Brazil, neither the onset of fertility&#13;
decline nor its acceleration during the 1970s was associated with large scale&#13;
organized efforts to provide family planning.&#13;
Regional and rural-urban fertility differentials characterized all three&#13;
countries prior to the onset of recent declines.     In Brazil, total fertility&#13;
rates in Rio and Sao Paulo were three births per woman lower than in the&#13;
Northeast as early as 1950, indicating that the transition to lower fertility&#13;
was already underway in the Southeast by that time (Table 3).       Between 1950&#13;
and 1970, total fertility actually increased in the Northeast and Frontier&#13;
regions.     Declines  of  about  0.5   births  per  woman   occurred  in  Minas&#13;
Gerias/Espirito Santo and the Southern region, whose 1950 fertility rates were&#13;
inter-mediate  between  Rio and Sao Paulo,    and in Sao Paulo.      After 1970,&#13;
declining   fertility  spread   to  the   Northeast  and  Frontier,   with  each&#13;
experiencing declines of about 1.5 births per woman during the decades.        In&#13;
Minas Gerais/Espirito Santo and the South, there were declines of about two&#13;
births per woman.    In tenrs of the number of births, the declines in Rio and&#13;
Sao Paulo were less, since rates had been lower to begin with, though the&#13;
percentage decline was substantially greater in Rio than in Sao Paulo.      Thus&#13;
regional differentials have narrowed during the 1970s.&#13;
Earlier declines in urban total fertility rates reflect the experiences&#13;
of  Rio   and  Sao  Paulo,   where  much   of  Brazil's   urban  population  was&#13;
concentrated.   By 1980, 68 percent of Brazil's population counted as urban.&#13;
Urban total fertility was 4.7 births per woman in 1950, and declined only&#13;
slightly between 1950 and 1970.     Between 1950 and 1970 rural rates remained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
steady at 7.7 births per woman and then dropped by about 1.3 birQ'es during the&#13;
last decade. Aggregate fertility levels actuaity declined more t'hFin either the&#13;
urban or rural average because of the redistribution of populat on frcm rurao&#13;
to urban areas. During the 1970s9 rural population in Brazil deciined in both&#13;
percentage and absolute terms.&#13;

Colombia's main regions, and by just under 40 percent in Bogota.      Reductions&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

ranged from three to four births per woman, except in Bogota, Urban fertility&#13;
dropped by 2D2 births, while the rural rate fell by 4.1 births. As in Brazil,&#13;
the  aggregate  rate  fell   by more  than  e;ther  the  rural  or urban   rate,&#13;
indicating that population redistribution contributed to the       eccline.   In&#13;
Colcmbia, both rural and urban total fertil4ty started the decacGe at higher&#13;
levels and ended it at lower levels than in Brazil, with Colc,,biacs rural&#13;
fertility decline being more than double that of Brazil in tenms of the&#13;
decline in number of births.&#13;
Mexico  is  also  more   homogeneous  than  Brazil  in tems    of  regional&#13;
differentials in total fertility before the onset of rapid declires. There is&#13;
little evidence of decline in any region until the midY.970s (Table 5).&#13;
Comparison of total fertility rates derived from 1960 census data (based on&#13;
reported children ever born by women in their 40s) with rates from mid°1970&#13;
survey data suggest that rates may actually have risen during the 1960s,&#13;
though caution is required since there was underreporting in the 1.960 census,&#13;
and probably higher underreporting in regions (Golfo, Sureste, Pacifico Sur)&#13;
with  large  Indian populations.     The survey data also show a rural-urban&#13;
differential of 106 births per woman in the early 1.970s, with the rate for the&#13;
metropolitan area of Mexico City     being quite close to that of the urban&#13;
population in general.     During the 1970s, total fertility dec Aned by 30&#13;
percent in urban areas and 26 perce,t in rural areas0           In tY'vs, Mexico&#13;
contrasts with Colombia, where rural declines were greater in zbsolute and&#13;
relative terins.  On the other hand, the onset of fertiHty dec2ire was later&#13;
in Mexico, and urban areas appear to have led during the earlVnr phases of&#13;
fertility  declines in Colcmbia and Brexil.    Also in contrast tc Colombia and&#13;
Brazil, MexicoIs decline was concentrated in the )ast part o The 2170s, and&#13;
does not appear to have slowed down recently.&#13;

The Proximate Determinants of Total Fertility.&#13;
While social and economic changes as well as population programs have&#13;
played major roles in these fertility declines, in analyzing their effect it&#13;
is important to recognize that the reproductive behavior of individual couples&#13;
lies beneath aggregate rates.    Biological and demographic factors as well as&#13;
socio-economic   forces  influence   this  behavior,  in   particular  the  four&#13;
proximate determinants identified by Bongaarts (1982):       marriage patterns,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
contraception, lactational infecundability, and abortion0    Few Latin American&#13;
countries  have   detailed  enough   statistical  information  on  reproductive&#13;
behavior to provide a complete account of the declines that have occurred&#13;
since 1965.   Colombia and Mexico participated in the World Fertility Survey&#13;
during the mid41970s, and both conducted contraceptive preva-ence surveys&#13;
later in the decade, but Brazil has yet to conduct a national          fertility&#13;
survey.   Despite data limitations particularly information for establishing&#13;
benchmark estimates to measure the components of declines, it is possible to&#13;
piece together a fragmentary account of the proximate determinants of recent&#13;
fertility declines.&#13;
Assessment of the effects of age at entry into unions and the percent of&#13;
women in unions on fertility is complicated in Latin America by the influence&#13;
of consensual  unions on reporting practices.      All three countries include&#13;
consensual unions among their marital status categories. BrazilPs 1960 census&#13;
reported 5 percent of unions as consensual among married women between the&#13;
ages of 15 and 49; the corresponding figures for Colombia (1964) and Mexico&#13;
(1960) were 9 and 10 percent0 The problem is not that consensual unions exist&#13;
but in the likelihood that they are underreportedo3&#13;
The data   (Table 6) suggest that marriage patterns have changed little&#13;
since 1960; however, the strength of this conclusion depends cn whether the&#13;
reporting of marital status improved over the last two decades, particularly&#13;
with respect to underreporting of consensual unions.       If reporting did not&#13;
change, then one can argue that whle consensual unions were underreported,&#13;
the bias is the same at both dates and age at marriage and the proportion of&#13;
women in unions has not changed0    This leads to the important conclusion that&#13;
fertility declines that have occurred since the mid°1960s have been declines&#13;

in marital fertility, or more accurately, declines in the fertility of women&#13;
in unions.    This is admittedly a less clear-cut delineation of entry into&#13;
unions than demographers have in mind when assessing the effect of age at&#13;
marriage on the time during which women are "at risk," assuming that most&#13;
births occur in unions. In fact, the majority of births do occur in unions.&#13;
The three remaining Bongaarts' indices measure the fertility reducing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
effects of the proximate determinants of fert'lity of women in unions.      The&#13;
first relates to postpartum amenorrhea, whose duration is linked to the&#13;
prolongation of breast-feeding    after childbirth.    In most Latin American&#13;
countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, the average duration of&#13;
breast-feeding is short (less than 10 months), particularly among urban women,&#13;
and the fertility inhibiting effect of postpartum amenorrhea very limited.&#13;
Colombia's 1976 tJFS reported that 91.5 percent of urban women and 95 percent&#13;
of rural women breast-fed their penultimate child. But the median duration of&#13;
breast-feeding was 7.5    months, with shorter durations being reported for&#13;
lower order births.4    In Mexico's 1978 WFS, the corresponding figures were&#13;
83.3 percent for urban women and 91o9 percent for rural women, with a longer&#13;
average duration of breast-feeding, 9.8 months.    National level data are not&#13;
available for Brazil, but CPS data for a number of states indicate that the&#13;
practice is very limited. Median duration of breast-feeding ranged from less&#13;
than one month   in the urban Southeast to around 9 months        in the rural&#13;
Northeast, with low durations (4-5 months) reported in all of the urban areas&#13;
for which data were available.&#13;
In the absense of baseline data, most of what can be said about trends is&#13;
speculative. Differences in the prevalence and duration of breast-feeding by&#13;
birth order and education suggest that practice is more limited among younger,&#13;
more educated women, at least until the recent revival of interest stimulated&#13;
by evidence of its health benefits.      Urbanization and increases in female&#13;
labor force participation may also have had a dampening effect on duration, to&#13;
the extent that work outside the home requires long periods of physical&#13;
separation of mothers and infants, and as a consequence of inhibitions imposed&#13;
by  working  conditions  and  employer attitudes0     It  is poss,bble, though&#13;
difficult to document, that declines in breast-feeding contributed to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
persistence of high fertility (or even increases in rate) up to the mid-&#13;
1960s.    Potter  and Alba   (1983)  have  suggested  that  increases  in total&#13;
fertility in Mexico during the 1960s were related to decreased breast-feeding,&#13;
with rapid rural-urban migration contributing by shifting women from an&#13;
environment in which it was practiced to one in which it wasn't.&#13;
The third, and statistically most elusive proximate determinant of&#13;
fertility is induced abortion.      Despite legal  strictures,  the practice is&#13;
believed to be widespread in Latin America.     A high proportion of abortions&#13;
are clandestine, known only in terms of the large number of women seeking&#13;
medical assistance for complications arising from aseptic procedures. Annual&#13;
hospitalization rates on the order of 40 per 1000 women of reproductive age&#13;
have been reported for Mexico City (Ordonez 1975, Tietze 1981). In 1974, the&#13;
International Planned Parenthood Federation estimated that there were about 5&#13;
million illegal abortions per year in Latin America (Tietze), which&#13;
corresponds to an abortion ratio of 300 per 1000 known pregnancies, and a&#13;
reduction in fertility ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 according to the Bongaarts&#13;
index (the reason for a range rather than a point estimate is that the index&#13;
depends on the level of fertility and the proportion of women using&#13;
contraception).    One  rationale for government    support of family planning&#13;
programs in the region has been to reduce illegal abortion, and it is possible&#13;
that recent increases in contraception have partly substituted for abortion as&#13;
a means of controlling fertility.&#13;
Most   of  the  statistical   evidence  about  proximate   determinants  of&#13;
fertility points to increased and more effective use of contraception as the&#13;
main reason for the acceleration of fertility declines.       In evaluating this&#13;
evidence, account needs to be taken of the point made in the previous section&#13;
about abortion.     If abortion  rates have increased,    or even if they have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
remained   constant   instead  of   being   reduced  by   tne   subs-itution  of&#13;
contraception, then abortion could be playing a more important rove visa-v¢vis&#13;
contraception than the statistical evidence suggesCs.&#13;
Data from WFS and CPS surveys taken in the late 1970s ant' zrly 1980s&#13;
suggest that very    substantial  increases in the use of efFpec¢;i ve..ans cf&#13;
preventing conception have occurred during the last decade.        A summary of&#13;
recent data on contraceptive use is shown in the Table 7.&#13;

As indicated above, comprehensive national level data cin csontraceptive&#13;
use are not available for Brazil.     However, a sampling of sie ievel daia&#13;
from CPS surveys gives a sense of the range of regional varizat oi.     ,hfe firs§&#13;
Brazilian CPS survey conducted in Sao Paulo showed that 5             0ri   Marr°ed&#13;
women of reproductive age in the state were current users of ontraceptMon0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Total   fertility  in  Sao  Paulo   at  the  time   was  about  3.     While  oral&#13;
contraceptives accounted for the highest percentage of current users, 16&#13;
percent of women were surgically sterilized, suggesting that preferences for&#13;
sterilization in the United States and other industrialized countries has&#13;
spread to Brazil.    Sterilization also plays a major role in other regions of&#13;
Brazil  accounting   for  14  percent  of women   in  the  South   (Parana,  Santa&#13;
Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul) and Northeast (represented by data from&#13;
Bahia,  Pernambuco,   Rio  Grande  do  Norte,  Paraiba,   and  Piaui).    In  some&#13;
Northeastern cities, as many as 25 percent of women reported sterilization.&#13;
Recent CPS surveys for Colombia and Mexico show national averages of 46.1&#13;
and 37.8 percent of married women of reproductive age using any method; total&#13;
fertility   rates  at   the  time   were  4.2   and  4.7,   respectively.     Oral&#13;
contraceptives accounted for the largest share of women using any method,&#13;
followed by "other."     In both, surgical sterilization accounted for a lower&#13;
share than in Brazil.&#13;
These data suggest that increased contraception played a significant role&#13;
in declines in total    fertility rates.     Assessment of the extent of their&#13;
contribution   requires   benchmark   estimates   of   contraceptive   prevalence,&#13;
preferably in the mid- to late 1960s. Unfortunately, evidence for that period&#13;
is much more    fragmentary.    Rio de Janeiro,    Bogota,  and Mexico City were&#13;
included in a series of surveys conducted in 1964 by CELADE and the University&#13;
of Chicago, which indicate that contraception was limited both in its extent&#13;
and   its  effectiveness   (CELADE-CFSC   1972).     Current   use  in   the  main&#13;
metropolitan areas was 20-30 percent, and consisted mainly of traditional&#13;
methods (1972). More recent Colombian surveys show: (1) increases in overall&#13;
contraceptive use between the late 1960s and middle 1970s, but a slowing of&#13;
those increases after 1976; (2) narrowing of rural-urban differences, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
rural areas apparently accounting for all of the increase in contraceptive use&#13;
after 1976; and (3) a shift toward more effective methods, particularly in&#13;
urban areas. That shift helped to offset some of the effect of the slowing of&#13;
contraceptive use on fertility decline (Colombia, CCRP 1982)o&#13;
For Mexico, Gallegos et al. (1977) estimated that in 1973 11-12 percent&#13;
of women of reproductive age and in unions were using modern methods (pills,&#13;
IUDs,  injectables,   sterilization,  condoms  and   spermicides).    Data  from&#13;
Mexico's 1976 National Fertility Survey showed more than a doubling in the&#13;
proportion of women using a method between 1973 and 1976.       Increased use of&#13;
methods other than the pill accounted for the change:     the share of the pill&#13;
declined from 64 to 37 percent0    From 1976 to 1979, sterilizations accounted&#13;
for the largest proportional share of the 11 percentage point r,se in total&#13;
use and continued to increase in importance between 1979 and 1982.&#13;
Despite  the  lack  of comprehensive   benchmark  data  on which   to base&#13;
analysis of trends in contraceptive use, a fairly strong case can be made for&#13;
drawing  two  conclusions   from  the  data  that   are  available:    (1)  that&#13;
contraceptive prevalence rates observed at the end of the 1970s represent&#13;
substantial increases over rates in the mid1960s, with Mexico laggirg behind&#13;
Brazil and Colombia in the spread of contraceptive use; and (2) t'hat increased&#13;
use of more effective methods accounted for most of the gain, ',zading to an&#13;
increase in the weight of those methods in the overall mix of methods.&#13;
Thus most of the reduction in fertility that has occurred can be&#13;
attributed to increased use of effective contraceptive methods rather than&#13;
other proximate determinants.    The importance of this progimate determinant&#13;
can be illustrated by calculating 'devels of total fertil`ty corresponding to&#13;
different levels of contraceptive use and other proximate determinants using&#13;
Bongaarts' framework   and values of the four ii.dices (marr-* ge, postpartum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
amenorrhea,   abortion,  and   contraception)   that  roughly   approximate  the&#13;
experiences of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.&#13;

Table 8 summarizes these assumptions and their effect on levels of the&#13;
total fertility rate.   Assuming that the index of marriage remained constant&#13;
at 0.6, the total marital fertility rate is 9.18 if the other proximate&#13;
determinants have no fertility reducing effect.      Assuming that the index of&#13;
amenorrhea increases from 0.85 to 0.95 during the first stages of a fertility&#13;
decline implies a reduction in its impact.     Contraceptive use increases from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
10 percent to 70 percent of women.    At the same time the effectiveness of the&#13;
method mix increases from 50 to 90 percent0     The table also assumes that the&#13;
total abortion rate remains constant at a level 100 abortions per woman untfl&#13;
contraceptive prevalence reaches 40 percent, and then declines to 0050       The&#13;
initial level of abortion is assumed on grounds that less effective&#13;
contraceptive methods are employed during the initial stages of increased&#13;
contraceptive use, but are replaced by more effective methods later on, so&#13;
that the need for abortion declines.&#13;
With these assumptions, the implied TFR ranges between values of 6.7 when&#13;
contraceptive prevalence is 10 percent to 2.1 when it is 70 percent0&#13;
Intermediate values in the table cover the range of experience observed in&#13;
data for the three countries.      With contraceptive prevalence    ,n the 10-20&#13;
percent range, TFR varies between 6.3 and 6.7, which is approximtely the level&#13;
observed in the early 1960so    With prevalence at 50 percent, the TFR is 4.1,&#13;
approximately the levels observed in the three countries in the early 1980s0&#13;
Explanations&#13;
Does anything approaching a common "story" emerge from the ?ertility&#13;
decline experiences of these three countries?        Analysis of the proximate&#13;
determinants indicates significant change in at least one, and pcssibly two of&#13;
Coale's three conditions for fertility decline          access to the means of&#13;
fertility control and/or motivation to use those means.     On the s&amp;pply side,&#13;
the  data  suggest that before 1970 access to contraception        .b all 'three&#13;
countries was   limited   to  the  private  sector:    private  fa by   planning&#13;
organizations, private physicians, and commercial sales ( With, or more often&#13;
without a physician's prescription), and that the         marrket" for fertility&#13;
control (with the possible exception of abortion) was a very restricted one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
After   1970,   access  to   modern   means  of   fertility   control  increased&#13;
significantly, though the way in which it increased differed in the three&#13;
instances.&#13;
In Brazil, the private sector accounted for most of the expansion in&#13;
access to contraception during the 1970s. Commercial sales of pills played a&#13;
major   role.     Sterilizations   by  private   physicians   also  contributed,&#13;
particularly   in  the  last  half  of  the  decade.    State  level  government&#13;
intervention, in cooperation with the private family planning agency, promoted&#13;
the spread of contraception in poorer states in the Northeast.      In Colombia,&#13;
public sector intervention came in the early 1970s, adding to, and eventually&#13;
taking over the momentum that privately organized family planning programs had&#13;
created during the late-1960s.    Simulation exercises aimed at identifying the&#13;
role of various sources of fertility control in fertility declines that&#13;
occurred in Colombia between 1964 and 1975 suggested that public and private&#13;
organized efforts contributed about equally to the 44 percent of overall&#13;
decline in fertility that was attributed to these sources (Comite de Trubajo&#13;
1976) Commercial sales and private physicians continued to play a major role&#13;
even while organized programs added to the overall supply. Recent survey data&#13;
show that the share of organized sources declined during the last half of the&#13;
1970s.&#13;
Public sector intervention appears to have had the greatest impact on&#13;
increasing access to family planning in Mexico, where access through the&#13;
private sector (commercial and organized) had been weaker to begin with by&#13;
comparison with Colombia and Brazil.     Most of the increase in contraceptive&#13;
prevalence tracked by surveys taken during the 1970s can be attributed to&#13;
public  sector programs.     The Mexican experience    is still   too  recent to&#13;
determine whether a gradual shift to commercial sales and other private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
sources may be occurring.&#13;
Is supply the key to the acceleration of fertility decline, as suggested&#13;
by hypothesis A?  If there was arn unmet demand for family planning in the late&#13;
1960s, increased availability through a variety of sources would appear to&#13;
have satisfied a substantial part of that demand during the 1970s: providing&#13;
access to fertility control in instances where it was lacking or substituting&#13;
cheaper and/or more effective means in instances in which traditional methods&#13;
were known or available but not widely utilized. Survey data on knowledge and&#13;
use of contraceptives in the capital cities during the mid-1960s suggest a&#13;
large gap:   in Rio de Janeiro, 93.5 percent of married women in reproductive&#13;
ages knew of a method, but 32 percent were then current users;     in Bogota the&#13;
corresponding figures were 76 percent and 27 percent, and in Mexico city they&#13;
were 77 percent and 25 percent (CELADE-CFSC 1972).       tJorld Fertility Survey&#13;
data for Mexico showed a large gap between knowledge (90 percent) and current&#13;
use (30) percent for the country as a whole as late as 1978. Colombia's 1976&#13;
WFS showed 96 percent of women knowing about contraception and 42 percent&#13;
currently using (Mamlouk 1982).    Another measure of unmet demand for family&#13;
planning in the WFS data is the percent of married women in child-bearing ages&#13;
who want no more children: 61 percent of Colombian women wanted no more&#13;
children9 compared to 42 percent who were contraceptive users;     n Mexico, 57&#13;
percent wanted no more children, compared to 30 percent who were current&#13;
contraceptors (Kent and Larson 1982).     The lower level of unmet demand for&#13;
family planning in Colombia is a reflection of its earlier steps toward wider&#13;
access to the means of fertility control.&#13;
The main problem with hypothesis A is that it does not exclude the&#13;
possibility of changes on the demand side.    In the experiences of these three&#13;
countries, what suggests that such changes may also have been occurring is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
combination of (1) large socioeconomic class differentials in fertility and&#13;
contraceptive use prior to the recently accelerated declines, and (2) the fact&#13;
that the acceleration reflected/was made possible by the spread of fertility&#13;
decline to regions and groups that had not experienced it earlier.&#13;
In  addition  to  the  regional   and  rural-urban  differentials  reported&#13;
earlier,   substantial   socio-economic   class   fertility   differences   also&#13;
characterized these countries before the onset of rapid aggregate level&#13;
declines.   Baseline data on class differentials are limited, but suggest that&#13;
they may have increased prior to the onset of aggregage declines and narrowed&#13;
since.   Welti  (1982) reports increasing educational class differentials in&#13;
Mexico City between 1961-63 and 1973-75, which was the decade before the onset&#13;
of national  level decline in Mexico.     Survey data for Colombia showed a 3&#13;
birth per woman differential in total fertility in 1967-68 between women with&#13;
incomplete   and completed primary education (Birdsall, 1979).      By 1976 this&#13;
differential narrowed to 2 births.     More recent (1980) data are not exactly&#13;
comparable because of differences in their educational classification, but age&#13;
standardized differences in the number of births per woman appear to have&#13;
narrowed to 1.2 births in a similar educational breakdown.        In Brazil, the&#13;
differential in total fertility between urban women with no education and&#13;
those with 1-4 years of schooling narrowed from 2.2 births in 1970 to 1.6 in&#13;
1976  (Merrick  and Berquo,   1983).    Between  1970 and 1976,    the greatest&#13;
percentage decline in total fertility in Brazil occurred among lower income&#13;
urban women.&#13;
What accounted for the persistence of high fertility among poorer and&#13;
less educated classes and regions of these three countries until so&#13;
recently?   A basic point is that the development model which they followed&#13;
between 1940 and 1970 offered few opportunities to the rural and urban poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
for achievement of upward economic mobility through smaller faiiilies.     This&#13;
model emphasized import substitution, with detrimental effects on agricultural&#13;
development and income distribution because of the policies adopted to promote&#13;
industrial development in the manufacturing sector. 6       In agriculture, the&#13;
majority of farm families had plots of land that were too small to support&#13;
them.    With   little  access  to  land  or   credit,    their  main  economic&#13;
opportunities were   in off-farm   labor, a risky    proposition  For the lone&#13;
individual, but viable for the family unit t^hat could rely on some members&#13;
(more often women and younger children) to maintain the farm household while&#13;
others worked off the farm. For the marginalized urban population, the family&#13;
was also an important economic unit, both in securing jobs through family&#13;
connections and in broadening the family economic base by having          family&#13;
members work in the informal sector.       Neither situation, especiaily when&#13;
combined with   cultural  attitudes  about married women's economic activity&#13;
outside the home, provided strong incentives for smaller rather than larger&#13;
families.&#13;
Migration provided another outlet for pressures associatecl with rising&#13;
population growth rates during the 1950s and 1960s.         To the extent that&#13;
migration provided an alternative demographic response to these pressures, it&#13;
probably delayed the onset of fertility decline in rural areas.      But it was&#13;
also contributing to the eventual downturn in overall fertiPity rates, because&#13;
it  reduced  the weight   of  higher  rural  fertility  in  nationEl   averages.&#13;
Migration also fed the growth of the lower income urban populations among whom&#13;
the spread of fertility control during the 1970s contributed so substantially&#13;
to recent fertility declines0      All three countries have experienced very&#13;
substantial rates of rural.-urban population    edisriution    sir-.z  1950, and&#13;
cities have absorbed most of their population      increase during the last 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
years.    Between 1950 and 1980,     the urban  share of the total    population&#13;
increased from about one-third to over two-thirds.&#13;
Even so, shifts in the geographic distribution of the population account&#13;
for only a small share of recent declines.8      More important are the changes&#13;
that have been occurring within the different regions, particularly among the&#13;
growing lower class urban population.      While fertility declines were also&#13;
occurring in rural areas, it was the urban groups whose weight in the overall&#13;
total was increasing and without whose participation recent declines would not&#13;
have been so rapid.    Changes in social and economic status of those groups&#13;
could have contributed to increased demand for fertility control, possibly as&#13;
the  effect  of  social  mobility   (changes  in  the  proportion  of women    in&#13;
childbearing age belonging to education and/or income classes with higher&#13;
fertility   versus  those  with   lower  fertility,  as   suggested  earlier   in&#13;
hypothesis B1) or as an effect of changed socio-economic conditions on these&#13;
groups, so that in addition to redistribution among groups, there could also&#13;
have  been  pressures  leading   to  changes  within  groups,  as  suggested   in&#13;
hypothesis B2.&#13;
Limited available data on fertility declines by socio-economic class&#13;
suggest that there are elements of between group mobility as well as within&#13;
group changes in all three cases.    While there does not appear to have been a&#13;
marked improvement in income distribution in any of the three countries&#13;
between 1960 and 1980, there have been reductions in the proportion of women&#13;
with no education, and overall increases in average educational attainment,&#13;
with greater change in Brazil and Mexico than in Colombia.         Table 9 is a&#13;
compilation of data on the educational attainment of women in early&#13;
childbearing ages during the early 1960s and late 1970s.      As far as the data&#13;
permitted, women in their twenties were grouped into three education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
categories -- none, 1-5 years or primary level, and 6+ years or secondary&#13;
level    with exceptions noted in the table's footnotes.&#13;
The most striking shift between 1960 and 1980 occured in Brazil, where&#13;
the proportion with no education exceeded 40 percent in 1960 ane dropped to 18&#13;
percent in 1980, while the secondary (6+) class increased from 9 to 37.5&#13;
percent. Mexico also had a comparatively high proportion (36 percent) in the&#13;
"none" class in 1960, and experienced a decline to 18.7 percent in 1976. At&#13;
the same time, Mexico shows a slight decline in the secondary (6+) class,&#13;
probably because its (as well as Ooiombias) 1976 survey relates to married&#13;
women.  They generally have lower average educational attainment than&#13;

older age break (25-34 rather than 20-29) was used to compensate 1cr this, but&#13;
that also leads to understatement since those women are less like;y to reflect&#13;
recent increases in educational attainment.   Colombia had the hichiest average&#13;
level of educational attainment in 1960, with only 28 percent of women in the&#13;
none category, and shows less change between 1960 and i976 than Brazi) or&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Mexico, though the none group did decline to just below 17 percent, and the&#13;
secondary category increased from 10 to 22 percent.&#13;
Comparing the three countries, Brazil appears to have presented the&#13;
greatest opportunity for distributional changes to have contributed to&#13;
fertility decline, since it had the highest initial proportion of women with&#13;
no  education.    Columbia,  with   a lower  initial   level  of women with   no&#13;
education, offered the least. Experience confirms that redistribution did, in&#13;
fact, play a larger role in Brazil.     For example, changes in the educational&#13;
compostion of the population accounted for 55 percent of the decline in&#13;
children ever born among married urban women in Brazil between 1970 and 1976&#13;
(Merrick and Berquo 1983).     A similar exercise for Colombia indicated that&#13;
only 20% of declines between 1968 and 1974 could be attributed to the effects&#13;
of changes in socio-economic characteristics (Comite de Trubajo 1976).      Data&#13;
were not sufficient to permit similar calculations for Mexico; however, data&#13;
on fertility declines for roughly similar socio-economic groups in prevalence&#13;
surveys suggest the Mexican experience has been closer to Colombia's than to&#13;
'9&#13;
Brazil's       Mexico  is   an  interesting   story  in   that  the  educational&#13;
redistribution that occurred between 1960 and 1976 had little immediate impact&#13;
on fertility, since the main fertility declines occurred after 1976.        In a&#13;
sense, this is also true of Colombia, since educational attainment was high&#13;
compared   to  Brazil  before   the  onset  of  Colombia's   fertility  decline,&#13;
suggesting that in both Colombia and Mexico changes in the educational&#13;
distribution were not sufficient conditions to trigger rapid declines in&#13;
fertility.     The  existence  of   large  difference   in  total  fertility   by&#13;
educational level before the onset of declines suggests that more educated&#13;
women had comparatively better access to fertility control as well higher&#13;
motivation to practice it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
What   is  the  significance   of  these  changes   in  femrna  educational&#13;
attainment?   Do they add up to a Latin AmericGan variant of the ft=graphic&#13;
transition, with its own special type of "modernization° cl' reproductive&#13;
behavior?   Evidence that fertility decline during the early 197's was greater&#13;
within   lower  income  and  education   groups  suggests   that  '.inks  between&#13;
reproductive patterns and changing socio°economic conditions w@re more complex&#13;
than  linear  "progress"  as  suggested  by  the modernization   model.    While&#13;
increased education changed the balance between the costs and benefits of&#13;
children at the household or "micro" level, there were also "macro" level&#13;
social and economic changes affecting the conditions under wh°ch micro leve'&#13;
choices were being made, either by broadening or limiting those choiceso&#13;
The generally greater impact of within group changes raises the question&#13;
of what made smaller families appear more advantageous to lower income and&#13;
education groups after 1965 than before.      Some aspects of the modernizatior&#13;
argument in demographic transition theory are evident even if they are not&#13;
labeled as such.   For example, increased educational attainmtn49 exposure to&#13;
the mass media, and availability of new goods (from appliances to bluejeans)&#13;
raised the consumption aspirations of low income groups, particuTJarly in urban&#13;
areas 10   Such changes represented increased participation of t:2e population&#13;
in the modern economy ("modernization"').   These changes were not neutral with&#13;
respect to fertility and family planning versus other types of behavior, nor&#13;
did they guarantee equal opportunity to realize new aspirations0&#13;
In particular, two sets of societal/institutMonal level cha..geS   hat were&#13;
occurring during the late 1960s and early 1970s warrant atten2t°n.       One set&#13;
consists of the forces, already described, changing access to      .nd attitudes&#13;
toward family planning through expansion of commercial distrib:ion systems&#13;
and organized family planning efforts0     Promotiona1 activities cf the latter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
often influenced reproductive attitudes even if they were not the source of&#13;
supply for a given user.    The net effect of these changes was to reduce the&#13;
monetary, time and psychological costs of controlling fertility.       The other&#13;
set consists of the combined impact of persistent income inequality and&#13;
inflation, which put low income families in an economic squeeze, making it&#13;
difficult for them to make ends meet, let alone realize increased consumption&#13;
aspirations.&#13;
To put this in perspective, one needs to recall the 1950s, when the&#13;
momentum of postwar import substitution sustained the growth of the larger&#13;
cities that were attracting increasing numbers of migrants from smaller towns&#13;
and rural areas.    Real incomes of the urban working classes were growing, in&#13;
part because price controls on food and other basics (public transport, for&#13;
example) helped to maintain the buying power of their modest wages, and also&#13;
because their growing political and economic power helped enabled them to&#13;
maintain  their relative   economic   position.   By  the early   1960s,   import&#13;
substitution lost momentum in Brazil; Colombia's and Mexico's problems&#13;
appeared somewhat later.11 The roots of their problems were political as well&#13;
as economic.    Inflation, fed by the wage demands of urban working classes,&#13;
played havoc with domestic and international economic relationships.        Food&#13;
production stalled, partly as a result of the disincentive effect of the price&#13;
controls that had been aimed at keeping prices low for urban workers.&#13;
There has been considerable discussion and debate about long term trends&#13;
in real wages in all three countries.       Reliable empirical evidence on the&#13;
purchasing power of low and middle income urban households is very limited.&#13;
All three have set legal minimum wage levels for several decades.       However,&#13;
wage levels have been changed at irregular intervals and coverage under the&#13;
legislation has been not consistent with respect to particular population&#13;

groups over time, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from trend&#13;
data.   To the extent that the data are representative of any group, they&#13;
reflect the experience of unskilled blue collar workers in manufacturing and&#13;
construction. Low skill service jobs are also reflected in more recent data.&#13;
Much of the debate revolves around whether and how much the purchasing&#13;
power of a day's work deteriorated, particularly in reference to the prices of&#13;
such basic necessities as food.      A number of authors have argued that real&#13;
wages deteriorated:    in Brazil, from the mid-1960s through the early 1970s&#13;
(Bacha, 1979); in Colombia during the early 1970s and Mexico later in the&#13;
1970s  (Berry   and  Soligo,  1980;  Solis,  1983;  Gregory,   1983).    Figure  1&#13;
summarizes real wage trends from the 1950s through the 1970s.          Three year&#13;
averages of available data on mimimum or blue collar wage indices are&#13;
presented for each of the three countries.     The Brazilian data show increases&#13;
from the mid 1950s through the early 1960s, followed by steady declines until&#13;
the early 1970s, when a very limited recovery begins.          The turnaround in&#13;
Brazilian wages occurs a few years earlier than the onset of rapid fertility&#13;
decline that occurred in the mid-1960s.        Colombia experienced rising real&#13;
wages through the early 1970s, followed by declines during the early part of&#13;
the decade, which is also the period of acceleration in Colombia's fertility&#13;
decline. Mexico, in contrast, shows steadily increasing real wages until the&#13;
late 1970s.    The onset of fertility decline in Mexico occurred before the&#13;
turnaround in real wages.     Mexico's oil boom (1974-79) and the expansionary&#13;
economic policies that accompanied it were instrumental in sustaining the rise&#13;
is wages   for a longer period.       Since  1980, Mexico has also experienced&#13;
declines in real wages.&#13;
Opinions about real wage trends are far from unanimous. Less pessimistic&#13;
views on Brazil are found in Morley (1982), for Colombia in Urrutia (1981) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Mexico in Gregory (1983)o     Some of their skepticism relates to the welfare&#13;
interpretation of wage data.    Household compositions, in parti cular, mediates&#13;
the impact of individual level earnings experiences on household income and&#13;
consumption, since one way to compensate for deterioration irn the real wages&#13;
of the principle earner is to increase the participation of secondary earners&#13;
when that is possible.12     This point has a direct bearing on the onset of&#13;
rapid fertility decline. If the income/inflation squeexe is understood in&#13;
general equilibrium terms, households adjusted to it by attempting to cut&#13;
costs,  increase  income,   and  reexamine  the`r  priorities  with  respect  to&#13;
expenditure patterns.     For households   that were starting    Ao shift their&#13;
consumption patterns in the direction of "modern" goods mentioned earlier, the&#13;
costs of children were competing with these aspirations.         With fertility&#13;
control becoming less expensive and more acceptable, one adjtstnent was to&#13;
delay or decide not to have more children.    Another was increased labor force&#13;
participation by married women, again with potential competetion in the use of&#13;
time for child care.&#13;
One reason for the high degree of correlation between education and&#13;
fertility is that increased education raises the value of women's time and&#13;
creates opportunities for substituting work and earnings cuts-id" the home for&#13;
such home-based activities as the rearing of children.13       In most of Latin&#13;
America, female labor force participation rates have been lc- by comparison&#13;
with other areas, particularly more industrialized countries0      Kr part, this&#13;
is a reflection of reporting practices that have understated thc economic role&#13;
of women.   This leads to the reporting of very     cw participa-ion rates for&#13;
rural women, even though a very high proportion of them are engaged in homne&#13;
based artisan and subsistence agricultural activities0 Increased urbanization&#13;
initially brought even lower rates, since artisan manufacture gave way to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
factory production, and few women were employed in the latter.     Even with the&#13;
expansion of urban services, female participation rates remained low in&#13;
comparison to industrialized countries.    Only during the last ten to fifteen&#13;
years have female labor force participation rates in the region registered an&#13;
appreciable upwary trend.&#13;
Data for Brazil,    shown in Table 10,    illustrate the point.     In 1960&#13;
Brazil's female labor force participation rates exhibited the typical Latin&#13;
American pattern identified by Durand (1976): rates that ranged between 20-25&#13;
percent for women in their late teens and early twenties, with declining rates&#13;
at older ages. The same basic pattern emerges in 1970, though rates for women&#13;
in their twenties increased by about 6 percentage points,        suggesting the&#13;
beginning of a new pattern in which peak rates occur at older ages.       At the&#13;
same time, Brazil's rates were far lower than in the United States, where the&#13;
overall average was more than double that of Brazil, and higher rates continue&#13;
at older ages, reflecting the return of married women to the labor force that&#13;
has been occurring since the end of the Second World War. Patterns that are&#13;
similar   to  Brazil   are  observed   in  Mexico,   which  had   slighly  lower&#13;
participation rates than Brazil, and in Colombia, where rates were slightly&#13;
higher (census dates were also 3-4 years later).&#13;
During the 1970s, Brazil experienced a significant rise in female labor&#13;
force participation. Overall, rates increased by 10-15 percentage points, but&#13;
more important, the main shifts occurred in peak childbearing ages. The 1980&#13;
rate for women aged 30-44 was nearly doubled that of 1960. It is important to&#13;
note that the "increase" in female labor force participation in Brazil may&#13;
reflect changes in reporting practices, since questions about economic&#13;
activity in the 1980 census avoided some of the biases that led to&#13;
underreporting of women in 1970 and earlier.&#13;

Recent census data are not available to confirm the presence of similar&#13;
trends in Mexico and Colombia; however, survey data suggest that this is the&#13;
case.   Since the surveys include only currently married women, their female&#13;
participation rates are not comparable with census data, which relate to all&#13;
women.   Rates for married women are typically lower than for all women.    What&#13;
is striking about the survey results is that rates for 1976 are higher than&#13;
earlier observations for all women, and that they exhibit the same tendency&#13;
toward increased participation of older women observed in Brazil.&#13;
Others (Potter and Alba 1983, Paiva 1983, Carvalho et al. 1982) have also&#13;
noted that institutional factors that had favored larger over smaller families&#13;
among lower income groups grew weaker during the 1970s.      Particular emphasis&#13;
is placed on both the way and the extent to which commercialization of&#13;
agriculture and increased restriction of work opportunities to wage labor have&#13;
influnced household resource allocation in rural      areas.    Potter and Alba&#13;
suggest that the shift to wage labor in Mexico delayed fertility decline by&#13;
providing an incentive for large families because more work options were&#13;
available,  but  that  these  incentives  dissipated when    the rapid post-war&#13;
expansion of Mexican agriculture lost momentum after 1965.          In contrast,&#13;
Parira  argued   that  the  expansion  of  wage  labor  in Brazil   reduced   the&#13;
advantages of large families because there were fewer opportunities for&#13;
children to work.&#13;
Underlying these constrasting examples, if indeed they hold up to further&#13;
empirical testing, are important institutional differences in land tenure&#13;
patterns that would have to be investigated.      Of particular interest is the&#13;
question of how women's participation in economic activity outside the home&#13;
was  related  to  these   changes.    Male  proletarianization  might   have  had&#13;
different fertility implications depending upon whether married women with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
children are or are not also involved in the shift to wage 9abor.          These&#13;
arguments help to explain declines in fertility in rural areas as well as&#13;
migration from rural to urban areas.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
The stories are still unfolding, and data are still beina assembled for&#13;
the task of providing a more complete explanation of the fertIlity declines&#13;
that have been experienced in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico since the late&#13;
1960s.   An attempt to reach closure on the question would take us well beyond&#13;
the scope of this paper, which has been an attempt to find common threads in&#13;
their experiences.   The data that we have examined support the vi,ew that both&#13;
supply and demand factors have contributed to the recent acceleration of those&#13;
declines.    Analysis of the proximate determinants of fertility identified&#13;
increased use of effective contraception as the main proximate determinant of&#13;
these declines, though increased access to contraception resu&amp;ited from the&#13;
growth of a combination of channels       rather than a single source.      What&#13;
suggests that demand was also important was that these decines were the&#13;
result of a spreading of lower fertility to groups which had rot previously&#13;
participated in declines and whose weight in total population was suostantia!&#13;
enough to influence national trends. While those weights have been increasing&#13;
in recent decades as a result of geographic and social mobPiLty, important&#13;
changes were also occurring in behavior patterns within groups.     Lower income&#13;
and education classes in urban areas, in particular, contributed to the&#13;
acceleration of fertility declines.    These groups have, on the one had, been&#13;
increasing their consumption aspirations, and, on the other, experiencing&#13;
increasing difficulty in realizing these aspirations on account of such&#13;
macroeconomic forces as inflation and persistent income inequaiity0 The paper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
has argued that one of their adjustrnents to these pressures has been to reduce&#13;
fertility, which has permitted them to allocate both time and monetary&#13;
resources to other types of consumption, necessities as well as new goods such&#13;
as appliances.   Its account of the speedup of fertility decline thus focuses&#13;
on the interrelation between micro-level changes in reproductive attitudes and&#13;
behavior and macro-level social and economic changes, suggesting that the two&#13;
sets of changes have played complementary roles in the acceleration of&#13;
fertility decline in these three countries.&#13;
Brazil's experience offers the most support for the hypothesis that the&#13;
onset of fertility decline was linked to increased economic pressures on lower&#13;
income groups. Real wages fell dramatically during the late 1960s, the period&#13;
when fertility decline accelerated, and without large scale public or private&#13;
organized efforts to increase access to family planning. The case of Colombia&#13;
is more difficult to interpret because the economic squeeze of the early 1970s&#13;
coincided with the expansion of organized efforts to increase access to family&#13;
planning.    The  two  clearly   had  reinforcing  effects  on  the  accelerated&#13;
fertility decline that occurred in Colombia after 1970, with a greater overall&#13;
impact on fertility since total fertility was higher in Colombia than in&#13;
Brazil to begin with, but fell more rapidly than in Brazil during the 15 years&#13;
after 1965.    It is interesTing to speculate about how much lower Brazil's&#13;
total fertility rate would have been in 1980 had Brazil followed the Colombian&#13;
policy of organized efforts to increase access to family planning.&#13;
Mexico's   experience   is  the  most   recent,  and  evidence   about   the&#13;
acceleration phase covers a shorter time period.        Data from Mexico's 1982&#13;
fertility survey suggest that the decline in total fertility in Mexico has&#13;
caught up with Brazil and Colombia.    Mexico's experience offers least support&#13;
for the economic squeeze hypothesis, since real wages continued to rise in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Mexico until the late 1970s because of the oil boom.      Fertility decline was&#13;
underway by the middle of the decade.     While the onset of the decline could&#13;
have been linked to broader structural changes described by Potter and Alba&#13;
(1983)9 the decision by Mexican authorities to provide public sector support&#13;
to organized family planning clearly played a key role in the spread of&#13;
contraceptive use to braoder segments of the Mexican population.           It is&#13;
possible that the deterioration of economic conditions after t`ne collapse of&#13;
the oil boom has augmented the impact of the program on fertility (which would&#13;
make it easier to understand the lower than expected level of total fertility&#13;
reported in 1982), but it is hard to conclude that the onset cf decline was&#13;
linked to the economic turnaround rather than the program.     The fact that the&#13;
program and its effects on fertility anticipated the economic crisis and were&#13;
then reinforced by it may have been the result of good foresight or good luck,&#13;
but it could bring beneficial effects in Mexice's future efforts to deal with&#13;
its many internal social and economic problems.&#13;

Footnotes&#13;
1.   This paper is a shorter, revised version of a background paper prepared&#13;
for the World Bank's 1984 World Development Report, which was prepared&#13;
with financial   support from the Bank.      Several  Bank  staff members,&#13;
particularly   Ricardo  Moran,   William  McGreevey,  and   Randy  Bulatao,&#13;
provided  valuable   comments  and  suggestions.    The   author  alone  is&#13;
responsible for its views and errors it may contain.&#13;
2.   See the notes to Table 2.&#13;
3.   Underreporting may well be linked to fertility, since younger women who&#13;
began a union as a consensual relationship could formalize it after the&#13;
birth of a child, while women who were in consensual unions in their peak&#13;
child-bearing years but have not had children may report themselves as&#13;
"single" (meaning never married) if the union no longer exists by the&#13;
time they reach age 40.   It is also possible that the pregnancy or birth&#13;
of a first child provides the circumstance that leads couples to enter&#13;
into civil and religions marriages as well as consensual unions, since&#13;
data on the mean age of entry into these unions and the mean age of first&#13;
birth show that the differences between the two is generally less than&#13;
nine months.&#13;
4.   Bongaarts'  index of postpartum amenorrhea (ci) measures the effect of&#13;
breastfeeding on fertility in terms of a ratio that expresses the&#13;
proportional reduction in total fertility attributable to postpartum&#13;
infecundability. Index values based on Colombia's 1976 and Mexico's 1978&#13;
WFS data are identical -- 0.84.     Values derived from Brazilian CPS data&#13;
range between 0.85 and 0.97, and an attempt to construct a weighted&#13;
average suggested a level of 0.91 for the mid-1970s (Merrick and Berquo&#13;
1983).    The  fertility  reducing  effect  in  these three   countries  is&#13;
substantially less than in a number of South and Southeast Asian&#13;
countries, where index values of 0.54 (Bangladesh), 0.58 (Indonesia) and&#13;
0.61 (Sri Lanka) have been reported.&#13;
5.   For accounts of the import substituting industrialization experience in&#13;
Latin America and its effects on agriculture and income distribution, see&#13;
Furtado (1976).&#13;
6.   Potter and Alba    (1983)  make  this  point  in explaining why    fertility&#13;
decline was so late in coming to Mexico.&#13;
7.   De Janvry (1981, p. 91) adds that migration adds to the motivation for&#13;
having a larger number of births because as older children move away,&#13;
younger ones are needed to maintain the stock of children working in&#13;
unpaid family labor.&#13;
8.   For example, recalculation 1980 fertility rates using 1960 rural/urban&#13;
weights, Brazil's overall total fertility rate in 1980 would have been&#13;
5.1 rather than 4.3, Colombia's 4.1 rather than 3.6, and Mexico's would&#13;
have been 4.6, compared to the observed level of 4.5 births.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.   Uthoff and Gonzales, (1984) carried cut a standardization exercise using&#13;
1968 and 1970 census data for Mexico and found very limited compositional&#13;
effect.   Garcia y Garna came to similar conclusions about the effects of&#13;
changing educational composition.&#13;

11.  Brazil's industrial sector expanded at a rate of more than 1.0 percent per&#13;
annum during the 1950s; from 1962 to 1967 the rate fell to less than 4&#13;
percent.  During the subsequent recovery (1968-74) -he rate of industrial&#13;
expansion  was  well  above  10   percent;  however,  the  reel  income  of&#13;
industrial workers deteriorated under the wage policy that was adopted0&#13;
Mexico experienced more rapid industrial growth rates during the 1960s,&#13;
followed by a slowdown during the 1970s.      Colcmbia2s industrial growth&#13;
rates did not reach levels attained by Brazil and Mexico. lThile the rate&#13;
of growth slowed during the early 1960s, the recession was not as great&#13;
as in Brazil (see Furtado, 1976, p. 152)o&#13;
12. An illustration of the way that households in Brazil adapted to the&#13;
earnings squeeze during the early 1970s is found in Sant'Arnna, Merrick,&#13;
and Mazumdar (1976).     That study found considerable var'ation in the&#13;
capacity to maintain household income levels according to family size,&#13;
structure, and stages in the family life cycle.    For example, households&#13;
with small children and those headed by women were less likely to have&#13;
income supplemented by the earnings of a secondary earner.     The infonmal&#13;
sector provided opportunties for secondary earners in cases where a&#13;
household was able to rely on an additional member!s work outside the&#13;
home.&#13;
13. The logic of the relation between female educational attainment, labor&#13;
force participation, and fertility has been spelled out in the extension&#13;
of  micro-economic   theory  that  has  been  labelled  as   'e  "nedj home&#13;
economics."   Many Latin American social scientists object to that logic&#13;
on the grounds that its emphasis on the inverse relation bet^seen risinq&#13;
education and declining fertility as part of a "modernizaE-on" process&#13;
puts too much emphasis on rationalistic optimising by individual decision&#13;
makers, with implications that "the market" is doing its work0          The&#13;
critics feel that the focus on individual behavior neglects overarching&#13;
"structural" forces which limit the range of individual cVoIce, and the&#13;
"optimizing"  has welfare   implications  wich  suggests  that  people  are&#13;
becoming better off in the process, when in fact they are iaving a very&#13;
difficult time maintaining their living standard, or even experiencing a&#13;
decline in welfare0    In part, the difference in viewpoints is semantic,&#13;
since  "optimizing"   is  being  confused  with  "optimal"%  n.icro-econcmic&#13;
theory does not preclude the possibility of optimizing in circumstances&#13;
that require choosing the best possible allocation of resources when&#13;
resources are shrinking.&#13;

            Recent fertility declines in Brazil,
            Colombia and Mexico
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Because of decline in fertility,
            population growth has been declining in Brazil and Colombia
            since the mid-1960s and in Mexico since the mid-1970s. The
            paper examines the determinants of the onset and spread of
            fertility decline in each country and concludes that both
            supply and demand factors contributed to their acceleration.
            Analysis of the proximate determinants of fertility
            indicates increased use of effective contraceptives as the
            main contributor on the supply side. Demand was important
            because the fertility decline was also related to increased
            economic pressures on lower income classes. Overall, the
            decline in fertility has accelerated because it has spread
            to these income groups.
