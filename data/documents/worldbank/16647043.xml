            In response to the preventable threats
            posed by poor sanitation and hygiene, the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) launched global scaling up
            handwashing and global scaling up rural sanitation in 2006
            to improve the health and welfare outcomes for millions of
            poor people. Local and national governments are implementing
            these large-scale projects with technical support from WSP.
            Handwashing with soap at critical times (such as after
            contact with feces and before handling food) has been shown
            to substantially reduce the risk of diarrhea, even when
            households do not have access to basic sanitation and water
            supply services. The handwashing project aims to test
            whether handwashing with soap behavior can be generated at
            scale and sustained among the poor and vulnerable using
            innovative promotional approaches.
