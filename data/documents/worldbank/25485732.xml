The Solomon Islandsâ&#128;&#153; Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) commissioned and&#13;
oversaw this study. The study team is particularly grateful for the leadership and contributions&#13;
of Dr. Chris Becha, Undersecretary for Policy and Planning for the MHMS, who served as the&#13;
Chair of the studyâ&#128;&#153;s Steering Committee, and to Mr. Ivan Ghemu, Director for Policy and&#13;
Planning for the MHMS, who served as the technical focal point for the study. Provincial Health&#13;
Directors and Directors of Nursing, as well as staff from the National Referral Hospital, also&#13;
provided invaluable advice and support to the study team, particularly during the fieldwork and&#13;
at the workshops held in November 2013 and October 2014 to discuss the findings.&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS seconded eight nurses to the study as fieldworkers to undertake data collection at 97&#13;
facilities: Rolland Alex, Jenima Arahautu, Larisha Dickson, Wilson Haga, Paterson Kevin,&#13;
Philip Ngosokobu, George Tufia, and Mary Tufunga. The study team are indebted to them for&#13;
their insights on the Solomon Islandsâ&#128;&#153; health system and for their commitment to the study; the&#13;
study team is also grateful to Mr. George Pego, Deputy Director of Nursing for the MHMS, who&#13;
suggested and facilitated their secondment. Patrina Sua and Shelly Beni (Youth at Work Interns&#13;
supported by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)) and Grace Rani (independent&#13;
consultant) also worked tirelessly on data entry.&#13;
&#13;
The study would not have been possible without the contributions of the numerous health&#13;
workers and patients who agreed to be interviewed for the study. The study team also relied&#13;
heavily on data collected by the MHMSâ&#128;&#153; Health Information System, the National Referral&#13;
Hospitalâ&#128;&#153;s Patient Information System, the National Medical Storesâ&#128;&#153; mSupply system and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Treasuryâ&#128;&#153;s payroll system; the study team is indebted to officials from&#13;
these agencies for their time and patience in extracting, sharing and explaining the data.&#13;
&#13;
This study was funded by the World Bank through its Pacific Facility Trust Fund, which is&#13;
supported by Australia and New Zealand. Susan Ivatts, Senior Health Specialist for the World&#13;
Bank, and her team, including Maude Ruest, Tony Higgins and Xiaohui Hou, facilitated the&#13;
study and provided invaluable feedback to the study team. The study team is also grateful for the&#13;
substantial technical contributions of Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya, Health Financing Advisor (Health&#13;
Resource Facility for Australiaâ&#128;&#153;s Aid Program), as well as from the Australian Department of&#13;
Foreign Affairs and Trade, the World Health Organization, SPC and other health partners.&#13;
&#13;
The study team included staff from the Centre for Health Economics and the Department of&#13;
Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University and Fiji National University. It&#13;
was led by Associate Professor Paula Lorgelly and included Associate Professor Duncan&#13;
Mortimer, Professor Ajay Mahal, Dr. Nicole Au, Rohan Sweeney, Dr. Jean Spinks, Sue&#13;
Gillespie and Katherine Gilbert from Monash University and Dr. Wayne Irava from Fiji National&#13;
University. Joycelyn Manakako (based in Honiara) provided support to the study team during&#13;
the final stages of the data collection phase. Additional and much appreciated technical inputs&#13;
were received from Brett Doble, who undertook the analysis of the NRH data, and Alex Avery&#13;
and the late Emma Beruter, who cleaned and coded the inpatient and outpatient data.&#13;

&#13;
All health service inputs, outputs and costs in this report are nationally representative estimates&#13;
of health service delivery in Solomon Islands in 2013, unless otherwise stated. For lower level&#13;
facilities (including Area Health Centres, Rural Health Clinics and Nurse Aid Posts), this&#13;
involved weighting the costs of the sample of the health facilities that were surveyed, by the&#13;
characteristics of those facilities surveyed (as per our stratified sampling approach) relative to&#13;
those not surveyed. Sampling weights were applied to Area Health Centres, Rural Health Clinics&#13;
and Nurse Aid Posts only, as the National Referral Hospital and all provincial and church&#13;
hospitals were sampled and therefore these estimates are already representative.&#13;
&#13;
The methods for data collection and analysis are described in the Technical Annex.&#13;

Definitions&#13;
&#13;
Child Welfare Visits refers to a specific field in the Health Information System (HIS) operated&#13;
by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS). The HIS guidelines define child&#13;
welfare visits as: â&#128;&#156;a regular scheduled clinic for babies and children less than 5 years of age,&#13;
either in the clinic or on tour or at a satellite clinic. Activities include Expanded Programme on&#13;
Immunisation, growth monitoring, health assessment etc.â&#128;&#157; 1&#13;
&#13;
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) takes into account the inputs (e.g.: costs) and the outputs&#13;
(e.g.: services delivered) of a facility to calculate a relative measure of efficiency. It produces&#13;
technical efficiency scores for facilities from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates the facility is&#13;
relatively efficient, and a value less than 1 indicates the facility is relatively inefficient.&#13;
&#13;
Efficiency frontier is a term used in the DEA. The DEA produces technical efficiency scores&#13;
for facilities from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates the facility is relatively efficient, and a&#13;
value less than 1 indicates the facility is relatively inefficient. Those facilities with values of 1&#13;
are considered to be on the â&#128;&#156;efficiency frontier.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Interquartile range (IQR) is provided in the tables annexed to this report. IQR includes Q1 and&#13;
Q3. Q1 is the middle value in the first half of the data set and Q3 is the middle value in the&#13;
second half of the data set. The IQR is available for each data point in the Technical Annex.&#13;
&#13;
Outreach services may be defined by trips for outreach, tours to communities and patient&#13;
contacts conducted on tour. Outreach trips include the number of trips for outreach reported by&#13;
health workers (to cost transport). Outreach tours include the number of satellite clinics, school&#13;
health clinics and healthy village activities or meetings reported in the Health Information&#13;
System (HIS). Outreach contacts include the total patient number of contacts for antenatal,&#13;
postnatal and child welfare conducted on tour reported in the HIS.&#13;
&#13;
Recurrent costs are defined by the Solomon Islands government as expenditure that â&#128;&#156;is&#13;
recurring spending or, in other words, spending on items that are consumed and only last a&#13;
limited period of time. They are items that are used up in the process of providing a good or&#13;
service...â&#128;&#157; 2 The recurrent costs included in this study are: staff salaries and allowances, supplies,&#13;
transport costs, utilities and maintenance. This report is focused on recurrent costs.&#13;
&#13;
Scale Efficiency is a term used to describe a model used in the DEA. The DEA takes into&#13;
account the inputs (e.g.: costs) used to run a facility, and the outputs (e.g.: services delivered) it&#13;
produces. A facility is scale efficient if any change in its scale (for example, the number of&#13;
inpatient admissions or outpatient visits) will make it less efficient.&#13;

Technical Efficiency (TE) is a term used in the DEA. The DEA produces TE scores for&#13;
facilities from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates the facility is relatively efficient, and a value&#13;
less than 1 indicates the facility is relatively inefficient.&#13;
&#13;
Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) is a term to describe a model used in the DEA. The DEA&#13;
compares facilities against each other to obtain relative measures of efficiency. For VRS&#13;
analyses, only facilities operating at similar production scale are compared against each other.&#13;

&#13;
Executive summary&#13;
&#13;
The Solomon Islandsâ&#128;&#153; Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) commissioned this&#13;
Health Facilities Costing Study (â&#128;&#152;the studyâ&#128;&#153;) to better understand how resources are used to&#13;
deliver health services. The MHMS oversees two main sources of recurrent funds in support of&#13;
this system: annual appropriations from domestic government resources and budget support&#13;
from its development partners, including via the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP). The&#13;
MHMS recorded recurrent expenditures of SBD 403 million in 2013, including SBD 262 million&#13;
from domestic resources and SBD 141 million from HSSP, which amounted to 17% of total&#13;
government recurrent expenditure. 3&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS uses these funds to support facilities at all levels of the health system â&#128;&#147; the National&#13;
Referral Hospital (NRH; unless NRH is specifically mentioned it is not included as part of&#13;
general reference to â&#128;&#156;hospitalsâ&#128;&#157;), provincial and church hospitals (referred to as â&#128;&#156;hospitalsâ&#128;&#157; in&#13;
this report unless otherwise specified), Area Health Centres (AHC), Rural Health Clinics (RHC)&#13;
and Nurse Aid Posts (NAP), and national programs. This study focuses on the facilities only.&#13;
Although the MHMS manages an estimated 96% of total health expenditure, 4 little is known&#13;
about how resources are used by these facilities. For example, what is the cost of staff, medical&#13;
supplies, transport, utilities and maintenance at any given facility? How does the distribution of&#13;
resources vary between provinces and facility levels? Better understanding these costs is&#13;
important to the success of the MHMSâ&#128;&#153; efforts to improve its use of existing resources to&#13;
provide quality services, and ultimately to improve health outcomes as part of the&#13;
implementation of its universal health coverage and role delineation policy (UHC/RDP).&#13;
&#13;
The study was designed to estimate the recurrent costs (staffing, medical supplies, transport,&#13;
utilities and maintenance) currently incurred by health facilities, taking into account funds from&#13;
the MHMS, as well as from churches, private organisations and patients. It found that:&#13;
â&#128;¢ An estimated SBD 231 million in recurrent costs was spent at all health facilities in the&#13;
     country in 2013. 5 (This only includes costs incurred by facilities and excludes other costs,&#13;
     such as the cost of running MHMS headquarters, or national programs.) Of this SBD 231&#13;
     million, 44% was spent at NRH and 56% spent at health facilities in the provinces and&#13;
     Honiara City Council (HCC).&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
  The MHMS recorded total expenditures of SBD 415 million, or 14% of total government expenditure (recurrent&#13;
and development expenditure). See: SIG (2014), 2013 Final Budget Outcome, Honiara, p. 13, 16, 19. Available at:&#13;
www.mof.gov.sb/Libraries/Budgets/2013_Final_Budget_Outcome.sflb.ashx. Some capital expenditure is recorded&#13;
under the recurrent budget on buildings (residential and non-residential), computer software and hardware, motor&#13;
vehicles, office specialised and other equipment.&#13;

  This figure is for 2012. Total health expenditure is the sum of public and private health expenditure. It covers the&#13;
provision of health services (preventive and curative), family planning activities, nutrition activities, and emergency&#13;
aid designated for health but does not include provision of water and sanitation.The World Bank, World&#13;

  Note that some of the SBD 231 million may not be reflected in the MHMS recurrent budget (SIG and HSSP) of&#13;
SBD 403 million, as some drugs, vaccines, or equipment are procured directly by donors and therefore not reflected&#13;
in the MHMS budget. Similarly, donations and contributions from private companies or patients are not recorded in&#13;
the budget.&#13;

&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                        Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Taking into account the recurrent costs at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP, total recurrent&#13;
      costs in each province varied from SBD 128 per capita in Guadalcanal to SBD 350 in&#13;
      Western, and SBD 229 in HCC. However, including the NRH, total recurrent spending per&#13;
      capita varied between SBD 300 in Temotu to SBD 515 in Central, and SBD 927 in HCC&#13;
      (inclusive of the SBD 229 per capita spent in HCC and SBD 698 spent at the NRH on HCC&#13;
      residents).&#13;
â&#128;¢     On average, staffing was the largest recurrent cost type at all facility levels, ranging between&#13;
      51% and 69% of recurrent costs. Medical supplies were the second highest cost for hospitals,&#13;
      AHC, RHC and NAP ranging between 16% and 32% of recurrent costs. Electricity was the&#13;
      second highest cost at the NRH (11%).&#13;
â&#128;¢     Child welfare visits 6 were the first or second most common reason for presentation at&#13;
      outpatients at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP, accounting for 10% to 11% of all outpatient&#13;
      visits. The cost of a visit varied from SBD 64 at hospital to SBD 44 at NAP.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Deliveries were the most common cause of admission at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP,&#13;
      ranging from 14% to 42% of admissions. The cost of deliveries varied from SBD 2,949 at&#13;
      hospitals to SBD 1,277 at NAP (compared to SBD 2,250 at the NRH).&#13;
â&#128;¢     45% of hospitals and 70% of AHC, RHC and NAP collect contributions for outpatient&#13;
      consultations and an estimated 37% of patients made a contribution to see a health worker at&#13;
      a facility managed or co-managed by the government.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 1 shows the total recurrent costs by facility type and province. As shown in Figure 1, 44%&#13;
of recurrent costs were spent at the NRH in 2013, 27% at 11 hospitals, 10% at 31 AHC, 12% at&#13;
115 RHC and 7% at 190 NAP. Malaita (15%) and Western (12%) incurred the largest share of&#13;
recurrent costs spent in the provinces, followed by HCC (6%), Makira (5%), Guadalcanal (5%),&#13;
Isabel (4%), Central (3%), Choiseul (3%) and Temotu (3%). 7&#13;
&#13;
With respect to recurrent costs per capita (incurred at provincial levels services and thus&#13;
excluding the costs incurred at NRH), Guadalcanal, which does not have a provincial hospital&#13;
(as the NRH and Good Samaritan Hospital, a church hospital, are located on the same island),&#13;
has the lowest recurrent cost per capita of SBD 128. Western (SBD 350) and Isabel (SBD 344)&#13;
have the highest cost per capita.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 2 shows the total average recurrent cost by facility type. The total recurrent cost of&#13;
running the NRH was estimated to be SBD 101 million in 2013. This differs from the amount&#13;
reported in the 2013 MHMS budget (SBD 61.5 million) as it takes into account staff house rental&#13;
costs (SBD 12.4 million) and electricity and water costs (SBD 14 million) budgeted by the&#13;
MHMS administration, and supply costs (SBD 13.3 million) budgeted by the National Medical&#13;
Stores (NMS).&#13;
&#13;
The average hospital was estimated to cost SBD 5.6 million to run in 2013, the average AHC&#13;
was estimated to cost SBD 884,536, the average RHC was estimated to cost SBD 232,528, while&#13;
the average NAP was estimated to cost SBD 90,447 (refer to Appendix A for the interquartile&#13;

levels. The variation in recurrent costs by province is described in detail in Section 2.&#13;

&#13;
The recurrent costs for each facility were allocated to inpatient, outpatient and outreach services&#13;
based on the share of resources used to deliver each service (for example, the number of staff&#13;
working in inpatient and outpatient departments). At the NRH and hospitals, inpatient services&#13;
utilised over 71% of the total recurrent costs, while at AHC, RHC and NAP outpatient services&#13;
consumed over 67%. Less than 3% of expenditure was spent on outreach services at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
The cost per each inpatient admission, outpatient visit and outreach activity was calculated based&#13;
on the estimated annual cost for each service and the total number of services provided annually.&#13;
For example, the cost of all outpatient departments at NRH (SBD 28.9 million) was divided by&#13;
the number of outpatient presentations (62,985) to calculate the cost per outpatient (SBD 459).&#13;
The average cost of an outpatient consultation ranged from SBD 459 at the NRH to SBD 43 at a&#13;
NAP. The average cost of an inpatient admission ranged from SBD 5,772 at the NRH to SBD&#13;
2,160 at an average RHC. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the average number and cost of outpatient&#13;
visits and inpatient admissions respectively.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3: Average number and cost of outpatient consultations by facility type, 2013&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Outpatient visits and inpatient admissions were classified using the International Statistical&#13;
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision using the sample of&#13;
patient records from outpatient and inpatient registers and case notes. The recurrent costs for&#13;
each facility were allocated to inpatient and outpatient conditions based on the information&#13;
collected on resources used to treat each condition (for example, the dose and cost of drugs).&#13;
This information was often limited so the resulting estimates may not fully represent the&#13;
variation in costs between different conditions. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the proportion and&#13;
cost of outpatient visits and inpatient admissions for select conditions.&#13;
&#13;
At the NRH emergency department (general outpatient department) and NAP the most common&#13;
reason for outpatient presentation was signs and symptoms of circulatory and respiratory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;

&#13;
diseases (16% and 11% respectively). 8 The first most common reason for outpatient presentation&#13;
at hospitals, AHC and RHC and the third most common reasons at NAP were for child welfare&#13;
visits. Together with antenatal, postnatal, and family planning visits, these visits often take place&#13;
as part of specialised clinics at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP, but not at the NRH.&#13;

 Signs and symptoms of circulatory and respiratory conditions include presentations for abnormal heart beat,&#13;
abnormal blood pressure (without diagnosis), cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, throat pain, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
At the NRH complications of labour and delivery were the most common reason for admission&#13;
(24%) and (uncomplicated) deliveries were the second highest (21%). 9 Uncomplicated deliveries&#13;
were the most common reason for inpatient admissions at all other facility levels. The cost of a&#13;
delivery varied from SBD 2,949 at hospitals to SBD 1,277 at RHC (the cost of delivery at NRH&#13;
was SBD 2,250). Tuberculosis had the highest average cost per admission, ranging from SBD&#13;
40,344 at the NRH to SBD 1,266 at NAP. The high cost is primarily due to the length of stay&#13;
(LOS), which was 70 days at the NRH. Similarly diabetes also has a high cost per admission,&#13;
ranging from SBD 26,465 at the NRH to SBD 1,073 at RHC, as well as diseases of the&#13;
circulatory system including hypertension, ranging from SBD 18,348 at the NRH to SBD 1,399&#13;
at RHC.&#13;

&#13;
Out of pocket costs incurred by patients were also estimated. While legislation only allows the&#13;
collection of contributions at hospitals, in the patient exit survey they were found to be collected&#13;
at all facility levels except the NRH. 10 Facilities reported collecting contributions for outpatient&#13;
services (55% of hospitals and 70% AHC, RHC and NAP), inpatient services (36% of hospitals&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
  These two ICD categories: (i) complications of labour and delivery (O60-O75); and (ii) encounter for delivery&#13;
(O80-O85) are mutually exclusive.&#13;
10&#13;
   The Health Services Act (1979) permits for the collection of fees at hospitals, but does not currently permit their&#13;
collection at lower level facilities. See: the Health Services Act (1979), sections 4, 8 and 17. Available at:&#13;
www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/hsa161/hsa161.html. Section 4 states that â&#128;&#156;the services so provided shall be free&#13;
of charge except in-so-far as the Minister, acting in accordance with the provisions of this Act, may make Rules&#13;
authorising or prescribing charges for such services.â&#128;&#157; Section 8(d) gives the Minister power to issue regulations â&#128;&#156;for&#13;
the control of, and the payment of fees for, the use of facilities of public hospitals by private medical and dental&#13;
practitioners.â&#128;&#157; The subsidiary legislation and regulations provide a schedule for the collection of fees at the NRH&#13;
and hospitals. All fees that are collected are required to be placed into the consolidated fund under section 17(2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and 32% AHC, RHC and NAP), and deliveries (27% of hospitals and 32% of AHC, RHC and&#13;
NAP). A smaller number of hospitals collected contributions for immunisation services and&#13;
diagnostic tests. All hospitals and over 50% of AHC, RHC and NAP collected contributions for&#13;
medical record books, motherâ&#128;&#153;s books, and baby books, and a smaller proportion also charged&#13;
for family planning books, antenatal cards and sick leave requests. Of the facilities that did&#13;
collect contributions for services and books, the average amount was higher at hospitals than&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP, except for medical record, motherâ&#128;&#153;s and baby books.&#13;
&#13;
Across all facility types, 35% of respondents to the patient exit survey reported that they were&#13;
asked to make a financial contribution and 37% reported that they made a contribution. The&#13;
average contribution to see a health worker was SBD 3.35. A higher proportion of those in the&#13;
first, second and third quintiles made a contribution to see the health worker relative to the&#13;
fourth and fifth quintiles. Respondents in the fifth quintile paid more on average (SBD 7.10)&#13;
than respondents in other quintiles to see the health worker (although this was not statistically&#13;
significant).&#13;
&#13;
The average cost of transport to the health facility was SBD 29. Those in the richest quintile also&#13;
reported paying greater travel costs and also had a quicker travel time to facilities (20 minutes),&#13;
whereas those in the poorest or first quintile had the longest travel time (82 minutes) and were&#13;
more likely to have travelled by foot.&#13;
&#13;
The average costs incurred by respondents to the patient exit survey are shown by facility type in&#13;
Figure 7.&#13;
&#13;
Overall there was an under-representation in the poorest or first quintile (12%) and wealthiest or&#13;
fifth quintile (13%) and greater representation from individuals classified as being in the second&#13;
(33%), third (24%) of fourth (19%) wealth quintiles in the respondents to the patient exit survey.&#13;
The over representation in the second and third quintiles and under representation in the fifth&#13;
quintiles suggests that health care utilisation in Solomon Islands may be pro-poor. The under&#13;
representation in the poorest quintile requires further analysis.&#13;
&#13;
The efficiency of facilities was compared using standard measures of inputs to outputs, and data&#13;
envelopment analysis (DEA). Key performance measures by facility type are shown in Figure 8.&#13;
On average, AHC had the highest ratio of outpatient visits to clinical full time equivalent (FTE)&#13;
staff and inpatients admissions to clinical FTE. RHC and NAP had a higher ratio of outpatient&#13;
visits to clinical FTE than at hospitals and the NRH, whereas the reverse was true for inpatients.&#13;

The efficiency of the NRH was also compared to hospitals in other countries in the region. The&#13;
average LOS at the NRH (7.3 days) was higher than in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea&#13;
(PNG), but lower than New Zealand. The average bed occupancy rate (BOR) was 80% for the&#13;
NRH, 11 which was higher than for hospitals in Fiji (52%). Across Solomon Islands there were&#13;
0.2 doctors per 1000 population 12 ; this was slightly longer than for PNG, which had 0.1&#13;
practising doctors per 1000 population, but lower than Fiji (0.6), New Zealand (2.8) and&#13;
Australia (3.3). Solomon Islands health workforce population density (doctors/nurses/midwives&#13;
per 1,000) is estimated at 2.17 compared with 0.5 for PNG, 2.61 for Fiji and 1.8 for Vanuatu 13.&#13;
&#13;
The efficiency of AHC, RHC and NAP was also analysed using DEA. This analysis produces&#13;
technical efficiency (TE) scores for facilities from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates the facility&#13;
is relatively efficient, and a value less than 1 indicates the facility is relatively inefficient&#13;
compared to similar facilities in Solomon Islands. Those facilities with values of 1 are&#13;
considered to be on the â&#128;&#156;efficiency frontierâ&#128;&#157;; that is they are (relatively) efficiently using their&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
   The NRH reported the bed occupancy rate as 91.4% for 2012. The discrepancy is likely due to the bed count.&#13;
12&#13;
   Solomon Islands has over 100 medical students training in Cuba, as well as other under graduate and post&#13;
graduate doctors training at other regional institutions such as Fiji National Universityâ&#128;&#153;s College of Medicine,&#13;
Nursing and Health Sciences, and the University of Papua New Guinea; the first cohort of 21 medical graduates&#13;
returned from Cuba in September 2014 to commence a six month bridging course prior to a two year internship&#13;
program â&#128;&#147; a similar number is expected back each year for the next five years.&#13;
13&#13;
   This is against the minimum threshold of 2.3 per 1,000 recommended by WHO. Pacific data is from WHO&#13;
Country Health Information Profiles (Centre for Health Information, Policy and Systems Research at Fiji National&#13;
University), 2011, and WHO HRH Profiles 2012-2013 where available.&#13;

inputs to produce health services. The analysis at the individual facility level found that while&#13;
some facilities are producing outputs in an efficient manner, a large number of facilities are&#13;
operating a very long way away from the efficiency frontier.&#13;

As reiterated by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Tenneth Dalipanda, and other participants at a&#13;
workshop held to discuss the draft of this report in October 2014, the study provides a baseline&#13;
for further analysis and action. It has produced a wealth of information that the MHMS could&#13;
use to inform its decisions on how resources could be allocated so that the health system is&#13;
managed more efficiently and equitably. This includes through:&#13;
â&#128;¢ The annual operating planning and budget process (and how resources might be reallocated&#13;
    using a mixture of fixed costs and other components to increase the performance orientation&#13;
    within MHMS);&#13;
â&#128;¢ The setting of priorities as part of the next National Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 and the&#13;
    accompanying medium term expenditure pressures framework; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ The further refinement and implementation of the UHC/RDP and related service delivery&#13;
    packages.&#13;
&#13;
In addition the study has highlighted the need for further policy action and analysis as&#13;
summarised in Figure 9 (on the following page).&#13;
&#13;
The study also highlights areas in which the MHMS, together with its development partners,&#13;
could continue to strengthen its information systems. Priorities in this area include maintaining:&#13;
a consolidated list of active facilities used across the MHMS; a database of all staff working at&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
each facility; and a database of the NMS supply chain. In addition the MHMS could also&#13;
encourage all facilities, including hospitals, to consistently report to its Health Information&#13;
System, and improve the information systems at the NRH.&#13;
&#13;
The data that were analysed for the purpose of this report represent a small portion of the data&#13;
that were collected. Additional data were also gathered on the infrastructure and equipment&#13;
available at facilities that could be used to cost the standards set out in the UHC/RDP. There is&#13;
also opportunity to further exploit the data that has been analysed for this report. For example,&#13;
additional analysis could be undertaken on quality of care issues, such as the appropriateness of&#13;
diagnosis and prescribing practices for the use of pharmaceuticals.&#13;

&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                          Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The Solomon Islands Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) is responsible for&#13;
providing primary health care and hospital services to an estimated population of 526,000 14 of&#13;
which an estimated 80 percent live in rural areas. 15 The MHMS funds facilities at all levels of&#13;
the health system: the National Referral Hospital (NRH), provincial and church hospitals, Area&#13;
Health Centres (AHC), Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and Nurse Aid Posts (NAP). 16 The MHMS&#13;
operates most facilities and also funds a smaller number of facilities that are co-managed by the&#13;
MHMS and private companies, churches or non-government organizations (NGOs). 17&#13;
&#13;
The Health Services Act (1979) defines the service levels in the following way:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Hospital: â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness, including&#13;
   psychiatric illness or requiring rehabilitation, and dispensaries and outpatients departmentsâ&#128;&#157;;&#13;
â&#128;¢ AHC: â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦for the reception and treatment of persons, in which integrated primary health care&#13;
   services for a defined area are provided and organised, such premises being staffed by&#13;
   several categories of health personnel, and having supervisory and referral dutiesâ&#128;¦â&#128;&#157;;&#13;
â&#128;¢ RHC: â&#128;&#156;means premises with some residential accommodation in which integrated primary&#13;
   health care services for a providedâ&#128;¦ being staffed by one or more Registered Nurses and&#13;
   such other health personnelâ&#128;¦ and having referral and supervisory dutiesâ&#128;&#157;; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ NAP: â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦provide limited primary health care services, including obstetric services in&#13;
   emergency, and may have some residential accommodationâ&#128;¦ being staffed by auxiliary&#13;
   nurses and supervised by the Registered Nurse of the clinic in its area.â&#128;&#157; 18&#13;
&#13;
There are an estimated 344 facilities in the country, 19 including the NRH, 7 provincial hospitals,&#13;
4 church hospitals, 31 AHC, 111 RHC and 190 NAP spread across eight provinces and Honiara&#13;
City Council (HCC). 20 For the purposes of this report 4 AHC have been treated as RHC so the&#13;
number of facilities costed in this report is 27 AHC and 115 RHC. 21 Figure 10 shows the number&#13;
of households, hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP across the country.&#13;

16&#13;
   The MHMS is considering changing the classification of AHC, RHC and NAP; as this study is based on&#13;
analysing services that are currently delivered, the current classification of AHC, RHC and NAP has been used.&#13;
17&#13;
   A smaller number of fully independent private outpatient service providers operate in the capital of Honiara, but&#13;
are outside the scope of this study.&#13;
18&#13;
   Health Services Act (1979), s 2. The act refers to hospitals, health centres, clinics and aid post. The volume of&#13;
inpatient and outpatient services and the types of conditions that patients present with at each level of the health&#13;
system are described in detail in Section 3. For a more prescriptive description of the role of each facility type, see:&#13;
MHMS and WHO (2012), Health Service Delivery Profile: Solomon Islands, p.3. Available at:&#13;
www.wpro.who.int/health_services/service_delivery_profile_solomon_islands.pdf&#13;
19&#13;
   As noted in the Technical Annex (page 2), various lists of AHC, RHC and NAP were merged to estimate the total&#13;
number of facilities.&#13;
20&#13;
   As explained in the Technical Annex, Rennell and Bellona province is excluded from this study. It has has three&#13;
lower level facilities but no hospital. Its population is approximately 3,041. See: SIG (2009), op cit 15.&#13;
21&#13;
   The number of AHC and RHC was 27 and 115 respectively as 3 AHC in Central and 1 in Choiseul were treated&#13;
as RHC for the purpose of this report.&#13;

&#13;
The MHMS oversees two main sources of funds in support of this system: annual appropriations&#13;
from domestic resources and from its development partners, including through the Health Sector&#13;
Support Program (HSSP). The MHMS recorded recurrent expenditures of SBD 403 million in&#13;
2013, including SBD 262 million from domestic resources and SBD 141 million from HSSP, for&#13;
the health system and administration, which amounted to 17% of total government recurrent&#13;
expenditure. 23 These funds are channelled to facilities by:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Funding clinical and other staff, drugs and other supplies for all levels of the health system;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Providing health service grants administered by (i) provincial health offices (PHO) for&#13;
    hospitals and primary facilities and (ii) other providers. 24 The funds from both grants are&#13;
    used to contract additional staff, meet recurrent and some capital costs incurred at the facility&#13;
    level, fund the administration of the PHO, and cover the costs of transport of drugs and other&#13;
    supplies, supervision and outreach; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Funding and managing national programs, including in the areas of reproductive and child&#13;
    health, malaria and other vector borne diseases, non-communicable diseases and the national&#13;
    nursing administration, which all aim to improve the quality of service delivery primarily&#13;
    through standard setting and training.&#13;
&#13;
Although the MHMS manages the majority of funds to support service delivery and is working&#13;
towards better systems to account for these funds, there is little consolidated information on the&#13;
cost of key recurrent inputs (such as staff and drugs) and how these vary between provinces and&#13;
between different levels of the health system. For example, there is not yet a national database of&#13;
how many nurses (whether they are contracted by the national or the PHO or directly by&#13;
facilities) work in each province and in each facility. The National Medical Stores (NMS)&#13;
supplies second level medical stores and some facilities directly and does not yet&#13;
comprehensively record supplies ordered by each facility. Other operational costs for transport,&#13;
utilities and maintenance are funded by the health services grant given to each PHO, and while&#13;
the MHMS is beginning to systematise the acquittal of these grants across provinces, little is&#13;
known about how these resources are used across facility types. In addition, little is known about&#13;
the resources contributed by other providers to the system, or the costs that are incurred by&#13;
patients. 25&#13;
&#13;
These problems are common to many health systems. Yet addressing these gaps is important to&#13;
the success of the MHMSâ&#128;&#153; efforts to improve access to and the quality of services, and&#13;
&#13;
23&#13;
   The MHMS recorded total expenditures of SBD 415 million (recurrent and development expenditure), or 14% of&#13;
total government expenditure. See: SIG (2014), 2013 Final Budget Outcome, Honiara, p. 13, 16, 19 and 20.&#13;
Available at: www.mof.gov.sb/Libraries/Budgets/2013_Final_Budget_Outcome.sflb.ashx.                   Some capital&#13;
expenditure is recorded under the recurrent budget on buildings (residential and non-residential), computer software&#13;
and hardware, motor vehicles, office specialised and other equipment; as well as the portion of health service grants&#13;
that are used to fund capital expenditure.&#13;
24&#13;
   These grants are transfers of funds from the MHMS to the PHO (into a MHMS bank account). For accounting&#13;
purposes these grants are acquitted as an imprest. The MHMS budget includes health service grants to the PHO for&#13;
â&#128;&#156;primaryâ&#128;&#157; services (AHC, RHC and NAP) in all provinces and â&#128;&#156;hospitalâ&#128;&#157; services in six provinces (Central, Isabel,&#13;
Malaita, Makira, Temotu and Western). The MHMS budget also includes grants to churches in four provinces&#13;
(Choiseul, Guadalcanal, Malaita and Western).&#13;
25&#13;
   The Health Services Act (1979) permits for the collection of fees at hospitals, but not at AHC, RHC or NAP, see:&#13;
the Health Services Act (1979), s 4, 8 and 17. Available at: www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/hsa161/hsa161.html.&#13;
The Health Services (Hospital) Regulations (1980) provide a schedule of fees for the NRH and hospitals.&#13;

&#13;
ultimately to improve health outcomes for those it serves. The current National Health Strategic&#13;
Plan 2011-2015 (NHSP) sets out a vision for how the MHMS aims to do so, based on the&#13;
MHMS key values, which include universal access; equity and accessibility; and effectiveness&#13;
with efficiency. 26 Building on the NHSP, the MHMS recently initiated the design of a universal&#13;
health coverage or role delineation policy (UHC/RDP) to increase the availability and quality of&#13;
service delivery at facilities in rural areas. Yet without greater knowledge about how resources&#13;
are currently used within its system, and where increased resources are needed, the MHMS will&#13;
be limited in the extent to which it can successfully allocate resources to pursue its priorities.&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS commissioned this study, with support from the World Bank, to better understand&#13;
how resources are currently used within its system. The Centre for Health Economics at Monash&#13;
University, together with a colleague from Fiji National University, was contracted to carry out&#13;
the study with the MHMS. As shown in Figure 11 the study was designed to estimate:&#13;
1. The major recurrent costs of facilities, including staff, supplies, transport, utility and&#13;
    maintenance costs, across provinces and facility types;&#13;
2. The costs of services provided by facilities, across provinces and facility types; and&#13;
3. The costs incurred by patients, including voluntary patient contributions (fees), travel and&#13;
    other incidental expenses, across provinces and facility types.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 11: Sources and costs assessed in the study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The estimates of recurrent costs are based on current service standards, that is, the current levels&#13;
of staff and supplies provided to facilities. 27 As depicted in Figure 11, they reflect the estimated&#13;
recurrent expenditure from all funding sources, including funding from the MHMS budget,&#13;
&#13;

27&#13;
   However the cost estimates in this report can be used to inform the costing improvements in service delivery,&#13;
such as those set out in the UHC/RDP. The study also conducted an audit of infrastructure and equipment at&#13;
facilities. These data has not been included in this report for space reasons but will be made available to the MHMS.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
additional resources from church authorities, and revenue generated directly by facilities. 28 With&#13;
respect to the MHMS budget, the costs include expenditure funded from Solomon Islands&#13;
Government and development partners across all budget lines. The MHMS budget is allocated&#13;
to a total of 34 divisions. Ten of these divisions are the provinces (including HCC), four are&#13;
administrative units (headquarters and administration; policy and planning; internal audit;&#13;
nursing administration), 18 are national programs (such as the National Vector Borne Disease&#13;
Control Program (NVBCDP), and the National Imaging Division), and the NRH and the&#13;
National Medical Stores are also divisions (see Annex 1 for a full list of all MHMS divisions).&#13;
There are no specific budget lines for provincial hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP. Each of the 34&#13;
divisions is allocated a share of the MHMS budget, which must be executed based on their&#13;
annual operational plan. Divisions currently have a high level of autonomy for budget execution.&#13;
However, divisions like the NMS and NVBCD must work jointly with the provincial divisions&#13;
for service delivery. The budget source of each recurrent cost item in the MHMS budget is&#13;
described in Figure 12. It is important to note that the study does not report allocated budget. It&#13;
reports actual expenditure, without judgment of whether the appropriate price was paid for the&#13;
purchase of goods or services, or what the ideal cost of goods or services are.&#13;
&#13;
This report is set out in six sections. Readers unfamiliar with the study or Solomon Islands&#13;
should first review the Technical Annex, which provides a full description of the methodology,&#13;
including for sampling, data collection and data analysis. The report describes the recurrent costs&#13;
for all provincial facilities including hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP (Section 2.1) and the NRH&#13;
(Section 2.2), followed by the service costs (Section 3), patient experience at all levels of the&#13;
health system (Section 4), and key performance and efficiency measures (Section 5). The full&#13;
results summarised in these sections is available in Appendix A. The report concludes with&#13;
discussion of the results and their limitations, as well as key considerations for future policy&#13;
analysis and action stemming from the results (Section 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   Note that church-managed facilities operate within the structure of the MHMS, and like MHMS-managed&#13;
facilities they receive government funding, as well as support from the church.&#13;

2.1.1 Staff&#13;
&#13;
Staffing was the largest cost incurred by all facilities. The estimated numbers and costs of staff&#13;
per facility are shown Figure 13 to Figure 16 and presented in detail in Appendix A, Table 1 to&#13;
Table 3. Staffing at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) is described in detail in Section 2.2 of&#13;
this report, but is mentioned in this section to allow for comparison between facility types.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 13 shows the average total number of staff 33 per facility by facility type and staff cadre:&#13;
doctors and dentists, nurses, nurse aids, other clinical staff 34 and other non-clinical staff. 35 This&#13;
count includes: (i) National Service Employees (NSE) that are funded by the Ministry of Health&#13;
and Medical Services (MHMS) through the payroll â&#128;&#156;establishmentâ&#128;&#157; administered by the&#13;
Ministry of Public Service and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury; (ii) Direct Wage&#13;
Employees (DWE) that are funded by the MHMS through the provincial health services grant&#13;
administered by the provincial health office (PHO); and (iii) others contracted directly by the&#13;
facility or its supporting organisations. 36&#13;

&#13;
33&#13;
   Staff that were reported as hospital staff, but appeared to have functions related to the PHO were excluded from&#13;
this analysis: 20 staff members were excluded in total, including Directors of Nursing (5), Assistant Directors of&#13;
Nursing unrelated to the hospital (3) and public health coordinators (12). Provincial Health Directors who were&#13;
practicing as a doctor (Buala, Gizo, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi and Lata) or dentist (Tulagi) at hospitals were counted as whole in&#13;
Figure 13, but the allocation of their salary to the cost of the hospital was 70% as explained in the Technical Annex.&#13;
34&#13;
   Other clinical staff at hospitals include: Dental assistants, Radiographers, Radiography Assistants, Laboratory&#13;
Officers and Laboratory Assistants, Microscopists, and other allied health staff. Most other clinical staff at AHC,&#13;
RHC and NAP were microscopists; for the full list refer to footnote 44.&#13;
35&#13;
   Non-clinical staff include: cleaners, drivers, gardeners, kitchen staff, security officers, and administrators.&#13;
36&#13;
   Staff contracted directly by facilities or by other contractors are described at the end of this section.&#13;

&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                            Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
Doctors were only based at hospitals and the NRH. 38 The average number of doctors at a&#13;
hospital was 1.2, and the average number of dentists was 0.5 (compared to 73 doctors in clinical&#13;
positions at the NRH and 7 dentists). Five hospitals were without a full time doctor (Good&#13;
Samaritan Hospital (GSH), Kirakira, Sasamuga, Taro and Tulagi). Helena Goldie Hospital&#13;
(HGH) had 4 doctors, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi and Gizo both had 3 doctors, and Atoifi, Buala and Lata had one&#13;
doctor.&#13;
&#13;
Nurses and nurse aids were the primary clinician at AHC, RHC and NAP and constituted over&#13;
50% of all staff at all levels of the health system, as shown in Figure 13. The number of nursing&#13;
staff (including nurses and nurse aids) varied from 84 at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi to 9 at Sasamuga for hospitals,&#13;
from 16 at Honiara City Council (HCC) to 3 at Makira for AHC and from 7 at HCC to 1.5 at&#13;
Isabel, Temotu and Western for RHC. There was less variation in the number of nursing staff at&#13;
NAP, with all provinces averaging 1 nurse aid except HCC, which averaged 1 nurse and 1 nurse&#13;
aid.&#13;
&#13;
On average, there were more nurse aids than nurses at RHC and NAP whereas the reverse was&#13;
true for hospitals and AHC, although these averages hide variation between provinces. HGH&#13;
and Sasamuga, and AHC in Makira and Western had more nurse aids than nurses, and RHC in&#13;
HCC had more nurses than nurse aids.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 14 and Figure 15 show the average staff cost per facility at hospitals and AHC, RHC and&#13;
NAP respectively for 2013. These costs include gross salary and allowances, 39 rental schemes,&#13;
annual leave fares, as well as the employee and employer contributions to the National Provident&#13;
Fund. These costs include all staff based at the facility, as well as visiting doctors who see&#13;
patients at the facility. 40&#13;
&#13;
As shown in Figure 14 the average staff costs were SBD 3.0 million per year at hospitals,&#13;
ranging from SBD 626,345 at Sasamuga, which also had the lowest number of staff, to SBD 9.4&#13;
million at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, which had the highest number of staff. By comparison SBD 60.8 million was&#13;
spent on staff at the NRH. An average of 78% of staff costs were spent on doctors, dentists,&#13;
nurses, nurse aids and other clinical staff at hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
38&#13;
   21% of AHC, RHC and NAP reported that a doctor or dentist visited the facility to see patients. An additional 4%&#13;
of facilities reported that two doctors or dentists visit the facility to see patients. Only 5% of facilities reported that&#13;
visiting doctors or dentists visit the facility and are paid by a private company or a supporting church organization.&#13;
The costs of visiting doctors or dentists at these facilities are included in the cost calculations (see Figure 15). The&#13;
costs of visiting doctors or dentists that are paid for by the national or provincial government have not been included&#13;
in the staff costs for AHC, RHC or NAP, as these doctors and dentists are included as staff at hospitals.&#13;
39&#13;
   Allowances include those provided by the National Public Service or provincial governments through the health&#13;
services grant. They include: Acting Allowance, Charge Allowances, Danger Allowances, Dirt Allowances,&#13;
Domestic Market Allowance, Festival of Pacific Arts Allowance, Gratuity, Housing Allowances, Leave Conversion,&#13;
Miscellaneous - Taxable Allowance, Multi Allowance, Provincial Posting Allowance, Regional Assistance Mission&#13;
to Solomon Islands Allowance, Rent Subsidy, Repay Basic Salary, Repay Overtime, Responsibility Allowance,&#13;

As shown in Figure 15 the average cost of staff was SBD 454,510 at AHC, SBD 161,439 at&#13;
RHC and SBD 54,954 at NAP per year, yet there was significant variation amongst provinces.&#13;
HCC, as outlined above had the highest number of nursing staff at AHC and RHC, and a higher&#13;
proportion of nurses to nurse aids. Consequently the average cost of staffing in HCC was more&#13;
than double the national average for AHC, and five times the national average for RHC.&#13;
Guadalcanal had the highest number of staff and staff cost at NAP. Conversely, Makira,&#13;
Western and Isabel had the fewest number of staff and the lowest average staff costs of AHC,&#13;
RHC and NAP respectively.&#13;

&#13;
Figure 16 shows the average proportion of clinical staff costs by staff type (that is, whether a&#13;
staff member is a NSE, DWE or is contracted by the facility or other organisation). This analysis,&#13;
which is important as in practice each PHO allocates NSE and DWE to facilities, shows where&#13;
NSE and DWE are allocated. NSE staff costs constituted the greatest share of clinical staff costs&#13;
at provincial hospitals (80%) and AHC (63%), while DWE constituted the highest share of&#13;
clinical staff costs at RHC (49%) and NAP (69%). Staff costs at church hospitals spread more&#13;
evenly amongst all payers, including the â&#128;&#156;facilityâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
Staff paid for by the facility may be funded through church service grants provided by the&#13;
MHMS, hospital revenue, or other funding generated by a supporting church or private&#13;
organisation. Seven hospitals (Buala, GSH, HGH, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, Kirakira, Lata and Sasamuga)&#13;
reported as paying for at least one clinical or non-clinical staff directly and as did 13% of AHC,&#13;
RHC and NAP (11 facilities from the sample). While six hospitals reported paying for clinical&#13;
staff directly, only 7% of AHC, RHC and NAP did (6 facilities in the sample).&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the staff costs highlighted above, 79% of AHC, RHC and NAP also hold voluntary&#13;
community clean-ups at the facility. These clean-ups occur on average 9 times a year, with 38&#13;
people attending. Only 27% of hospitals, which more commonly employ gardeners and cleaners,&#13;
reported as holding such clean-ups, once a fortnight or once a month, with two to five people.&#13;

&#13;
2.1.2 Medical supplies&#13;
&#13;
Medical and other supplies, including pharmaceuticals, were the second largest component of&#13;
costs incurred by hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP (but not the NRH). The availability and&#13;
average costs of pharmaceuticals in 2013 are presented in Figure 17 to Figure 20 and in more&#13;
detail in Appendix A, Table 4 and Table 5.&#13;
&#13;
The availability of medical supplies was measured in the Health Facility Survey (HFS) by&#13;
recording if facilities had at least one unexpired unit of items in: (i) the list of priority medicines&#13;
for mothers and children from the National Medical Stores (NMS); (ii) a selection of key drugs&#13;
to treat non-communicable diseases (NCD); and (iii) the Expanded Program on Immunisation&#13;
(EPI) vaccine schedule. These items are listed in the HFS, attached as Appendix B.&#13;
&#13;
Over 70% of priority medicines were available at all facility levels. This is consistent with the&#13;
findings of the Patient Exit Survey (PES): only 0.25% of respondents reported that the drug they&#13;
were prescribed was not available at the facility. 46 On average the availability of NCD drugs at&#13;
hospitals, AHC and RHC was 93%, 88% and 67% respectively and the availability EPI vaccines&#13;
at these facilities was 100%, 97% and 79% respectively. There was greater variation in the&#13;
availability of drugs at NAP, as shown in Figure 17. On average 48% of NCD drugs and 32% of&#13;
EPI vaccines were available at NAP, which may not commonly stock NCD drugs or have cold&#13;
chain capacity to stock vaccines.&#13;

   This finding may also be partly attributable to nurse prescribing patterns. That is, if a nurse is aware that a drug is&#13;
not available, then she/he may prescribe an alternative drug.&#13;
47&#13;

&#13;
The costs of medical supply orders and freight are shown in Figure 18 for hospitals and Figure&#13;
19 for AHC, RHC and NAP. The drug costs include the cost of freight from overseas suppliers&#13;
to Honiara and the cost of associated insurance. The freight costs also include costs incurred by&#13;
NMS in delivering the supplies that it receives in Honiara to facilities that it directly supplies.&#13;
The NMS directly supplies: (i) 15 facilities that act as a Second Level Medical Store (SLMS); 48&#13;
and (ii) all facilities in HCC and Guadalcanal and some facilities on outer islands of other&#13;
provinces. The freight costs presented below only include the freight cost from the NMS to these&#13;
facilities that it supplies directly, which are costs that are borne by the NMS. Freight costs that&#13;
are not borne directly by the NMS (including the cost of transporting drugs from SLMS to the&#13;
facilities that the SLMS supplies and the cost of collecting drugs from the NMS 49) are presented&#13;
in Section 2.1.4.&#13;
&#13;
The average cost of medical supplies and freight at hospitals was SBD 1.6 million per year, with&#13;
a high of SBD 5.8 million at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi (compared to SBD 8.1 million at the NRH). The three&#13;
hospitals with the lowest cost of medical supplies and freight, Sasamuga (SBD 100,312), Atoifi&#13;
(SBD 410,179) and GSH (SBD 570,072) are the only hospitals that are not SLMS. On average,&#13;
hospitals spent 50% of the cost of medical supplies and freight on non-vaccine drugs, 34% on&#13;
other supplies, 15% on freight and 1% on vaccines. Tulagi was the only hospital that spent more&#13;
on other supplies (77%) than non-vaccine drugs (13%).&#13;

   The cost of other supplies includes those needed to conduct malaria tests that are provided by the NMS, but&#13;
excludes other laboratory and imaging supplies, which are described in Section 2.1.3.&#13;

   The cost of freight only includes the cost of freight from the NMS to SLMS or to facilities supplied directly by&#13;
the NMS, and excludes cost of freight from SLMS to the facilities that they supply, or the cost of collecting the&#13;
drugs from the NMS for facilities in HCC and Guadalcanal, which are described in Section 2.1.4.&#13;

&#13;
Malaita had the highest average cost of medical supplies and freight for AHC (SBD 736,138),&#13;
whereas Guadalcanal had the lowest (SBD 72,194). HCC had the highest average costs for RHC&#13;
(SBD 154,304), which was more than four times the average. RHC in all other provinces except&#13;
Central had below average costs. HCC also had the highest pharmaceutical cost for NAP (SBD&#13;
61,693), again almost triple the average. Conversely, Temotu had a very low average cost for&#13;
RHC (SBD 9,236), less than one third of the average, and Choiseul had a very low average cost&#13;
for NAP (SBD 5,994), less than one third of the average.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 20 shows the proportion of the costs spent on non-vaccine drugs, vaccines, other supplies&#13;
and freight for AHC, RHC and NAP. The highest cost was non-vaccine drugs, which constituted&#13;
53% of the costs at AHC, 39% at RHC and 47% at NAP. Like Tulagi, a lower proportion of&#13;
costs were spent on non-vaccine drugs in RHC and NAP in Central (11% for RHC and 27% for&#13;
NAP), and a greater proportion was spent on other supplies (77% for RHC and 58% for NAP).&#13;

2.1.3 Other supplies&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the medical supplies set out in Section 2.1.2 some hospitals also receive supplies&#13;
for their laboratory and imaging departments, and kitchens that provide meals for inpatients.&#13;
These cost estimates are presented in Figure 21 and presented in Appendix A, Table 6.&#13;

&#13;
The NRH, Buala, Gizo, HGH, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, Kirakira, Lata, Taro and Tulagi procure kitchen supplies&#13;
to provide inpatients with meals. 54 As shown in Figure 21, the average costs of kitchen supplies&#13;
for hospitals was SBD 176,426 per year, with a maximum of SBD 466,558 at Gizo, compared&#13;
with SBD 3.7 million at the NRH.&#13;
&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP and some hospitals only conduct malaria tests 55 and receive supplies from&#13;
the NMS through the medical supply orders costed in Section 2.1.2 above. 56 A small number of&#13;
laboratories at hospitals also conduct additional tests. This includes the NRH, Atoifi, Gizo,&#13;
Helena Goldie, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, Kirakira, Lata and Taro. 57 The National Laboratory Program also&#13;
procures items for these additional tests via the NMS and distributes them to laboratory&#13;
departments in these hospitals. The costs of these supplies are included in Figure 21. In addition&#13;
all provincial hospitals send laboratory tests, which cannot be done in country, overseas for&#13;
analysis (via the NRH). These costs are also included in Figure 21 as part of laboratory supplies.&#13;
As shown in Figure 21, the average costs of laboratory supplies for hospitals was SBD 120,364&#13;
per year, with a high of SBD 287,340 at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, compared with SBD 3.7 million at the NRH. 58&#13;
&#13;
The NMS also distributes supplies for x-ray and ultrasounds to imaging departments in a small&#13;
number of hospitals: the NRH, Atoifi, Gizo, Helena Goldie, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, Kirakira, Lata and Taro. 59&#13;
As shown in Figure 21, the average costs of imaging orders for hospitals was SBD 49,347 per&#13;
year, with a maximum of SBD 257,140 at Gizo, compared with SBD 687,867 at the NRH.&#13;
&#13;
Facilities also receive and procure additional supplies that have not been costed as part of this&#13;
study. Two national programs, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program and the&#13;
National Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health Program provide supplies directly to clinics&#13;
that were not costed. Facilities also receive or procure different types of medical record books 60&#13;
(books kept by patients and used to record his or her medical history), which have also not been&#13;
costed. Facilities also collected patient contributions for services and medical record books 61 and&#13;
used these contributions to pay for transport, which has been costed in the Section 2.1.4, and&#13;
purchase supplies including: stationary, toilet paper, sanitary pads, food, mobile phone credit and&#13;
food. These supplies have not been costed, but should be included in any facility budget.&#13;
54&#13;
   Atoifi, GSH and Sasamuga did not provide patients meals in 2013. Aotifi is building a kitchen in 2014, and&#13;
sometimes provides rice to long-term patients so that they can prepare meals. GSH has a bush kitchen that patients&#13;
can use to prepare meals.&#13;
55&#13;
   In 2014 the MHMS, with support from development partners, was piloting rapid HIV tests at some lower level&#13;
facilities. These tests are not costed in this study.&#13;
56&#13;
   The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program may also provide facilities with supplies for malaria tests,&#13;
which are not costed in this report.&#13;
57&#13;
   Based on provincial laboratory supply orders and discussion with Mr. Alfred Dofai, Head of NRH Laboratory.&#13;
Buala, GSH, Sasamuga and Tulagi hospitals only conduct malaria tests. Buala and Sasamuga have facilities for&#13;
conducting additional tests, but have not had a laboratory technician in recent times and did not make an order for&#13;
laboratory supplies in 2012 or 2013 based on the records received from the NRH laboratory. The laboratory costs&#13;
for Buala and Tulagi only represents the cost of overseas laboratory tests.&#13;
58&#13;
   This figure for the NRH includes overseas laboratory costs.&#13;
59&#13;
   Buala, GSH. Sasamuga and Tulagi hospitals do not have functioning imaging departments. Note that Taro did not&#13;
have a functioning x-ray machine when the HFS was conducted, but it did received imaging supplies in 2013 and&#13;
thus they have been costed.&#13;
60&#13;
   These books include: medical record book (or sickie book), family planning book, antenatal card, motherâ&#128;&#153;s book&#13;
and a baby book.&#13;
61&#13;
   These contributions are discussed in Section 4.3&#13;
&#13;

2.1.4 Transport&#13;
&#13;
The annual transport costs for AHC, RHC and NAP are shown in Figure 22 to Figure 24 and&#13;
presented in detail in Appendix A, Table 7. This includes the transport cost 62 attributable to each&#13;
facility for patient referrals, supervision, training, outreach trips, collecting drugs and collecting&#13;
money.&#13;
&#13;
The average cost of transport per year is summarized in Figure 22. The average cost of transport&#13;
was SBD 243,551 for hospitals, SBD 98,659 for AHC, SBD 14,622 for RHC and SBD 6,204 for&#13;
NAP per year (compared to SBD 4.3 million for the NRH). These costs are shown by hospital in&#13;
Figure 23 and by province for AHC, RHC and NAP in Figure 24.&#13;

&#13;
As shown in Figure 22, outreach trips conducted by facilities into villages 63 was on average the&#13;
highest transport cost for hospitals and the fourth highest transport cost for AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;
Based on the HFS, hospitals undertook an average of 15 outreach trips per year, AHC undertook&#13;
7, RHC undertook 4 and NAP undertook 2. Three out of four church hospitals (GSH, HGH and&#13;
Sasamuga) reported conducting minimal outreach trips. 64&#13;
&#13;
The average cost of a return outreach trip was SBD 7,805 for hospitals, SBD 581 for AHC, SBD&#13;
188 for RHC and SBD 102 for NAP. Some facilities reported undertaking outreach trips at no&#13;
cost. For example, RHC and NAP in Choiseul reported undertaking an average of 10 and 5&#13;
outreach trips per year at no cost.&#13;
&#13;
62&#13;
   Respondents to the HFS (health workers) were asked to estimate the average return trip costs for different types of&#13;
trips and were specifically asked to include the cost of fuel, canoe or motor vehicle drivers, accommodation and&#13;
food. Transport is funded through the provincial health services grant. These grants are acquitted as an imprest by&#13;
the PHO using Manage Your Own Business accounting software. These acquittals provide some information on&#13;
transport costs, but it is not consistent between provinces and it is not available for all provinces, for all trip types&#13;
and by facility type.&#13;
63&#13;
   For more detail on outreach, see the Definitions at the beginning of this report, Section 3.1 and the Technical&#13;
Annex. The data presented in this section on outreach trips were based on the number of trips recalled by health&#13;
workers in the HFS, whereas the data presented in Section 3.1 for outreach tours and contacts were based on data in&#13;
the HIS.&#13;
64&#13;
   These averages are lower than suggested by HIS data presented for outreach tours and contacts in Section 3.1.&#13;
&#13;
                                                          37&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                    Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
The overall estimated cost of transport for all outreach trips conducted in a year varied between&#13;
facilities. Five hospitals (Atoifi, Buala, Gizo, Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi and Lata) reported outreach trip costs&#13;
ranging between SBD 100,000 and 200,000 per year, well above the average of SBD 74,973 per&#13;
year for hospitals. For AHC, only Isabel and Western averaged outreach trip costs greater than&#13;
SBD 10,000, well above the average of SBD 5,267 for AHC.&#13;
&#13;
As shown in Figure 22, referral was on average the second highest transport cost for hospitals&#13;
and the highest transport cost for AHC, RHC and NAP. Usually, a referring facility is&#13;
responsible for paying the cost of transporting a patient to the referral clinic and the referral&#13;
facility is responsible for the cost of a patientâ&#128;&#153;s return. Thus the cost of the round trip between&#13;
the referring and referral facility has been divided between the referring and referral facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the HFS, hospitals made an average of 76 referrals per year, AHC made 252, RHC&#13;
made 18 and NAP made 8. Referral numbers were the highest for AHC in HCC, which reported&#13;
an average of 1,590 referral trips. 65 AHC also had a higher average cost per trip than hospitals:&#13;
the average cost per referral trip was SBD 824 for hospitals, SBD 1,542 for AHC, SBD 789 for&#13;
RHC and SBD 499 for NAP.&#13;
&#13;
Hospitals, in the outer provinces, including Buala, Lata, Sasamuga and Taro, had referral costs&#13;
totalling over SBD 100,000 per year, compared with the average of SBD 60,840. The average&#13;
cost of referrals was also higher for AHC (SBD 68,042) than hospitals, but considerably lower&#13;
for RHC (SBD 5,744) and NAP (2,738). Referral costs were highest for AHC in HCC (SBD&#13;
315,300), RHC in Temotu (SBD 40,000) and NAP in Guadalcanal (SBD 9,192).&#13;

&#13;
65&#13;
  These data from the HFS is largely consistent with the 2012 HIS data on referrals, although the overall numbers&#13;
differ slightly. According to HIS data, the AHC in HCC in the sample made or received an average of 1,499&#13;
referrals in 2012, including 931 referrals made to other facilities and 568 referrals received from NAP, RHC and&#13;
other AHC. Of the 931 referrals made by AHC in 2012, at least 45% referrals were made to other AHC, reflecting&#13;
the presence of specialist AHCs in HCC for certain conditions (e.g.: the diabetes centre at Kukum AHC) or&#13;
population groups (e.g.: the Mataniko Pikinini Clinic).&#13;

&#13;
As shown in Figure 22, training was on average the third highest transport cost for hospitals and&#13;
AHC and the second highest transport cost for RHC and NAP. This includes the cost of a return&#13;
trip to undertake training for any purpose. 66 The average number of trips for training was 15 for&#13;
hospitals, 5 for AHC, 1 for RHC and 2 for NAP, and the average cost of a training trip was SBD&#13;
3,286 for hospitals, SBD 869 for AHC, SBD 2,261 for RHC and 881 for NAP. RHC in five&#13;
provinces and NAP in three provinces did not report undertaking any trips for training.&#13;
&#13;
Malaita reported the highest training cost at all facility levels. The average number of trips for&#13;
training of all hospitals and AHC: Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi reported 100 trips per year, compared to the hospital&#13;
average of 15 and AHC in Malaita reported 16 trips per year, compared to the average of 5.&#13;
Training was the largest reported transport cost for Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi, with a cost over 6 times the average&#13;
(SBD 350,000 versus SBD 52,364), whereas the four church hospitals had the lowest reported&#13;
training cost. Transport costs for training at AHC in Malaita were over 4 times the average (SBD&#13;
37,620 versus SBD 8,425), and three times the average at RHC (SBD 18,331 versus SBD 4,840)&#13;
and NAP (SBD 5,538 versus SBD 1,772).&#13;
&#13;
Nurse Area Managers based at hospitals, AHC and some RHC are responsible for conducting&#13;
supervision to lower level facilities as noted in the Health Services Act (1979). 67 Thus the cost of&#13;
return supervision trips departing from hospitals, AHC and RHC has been attributed to these&#13;
facilities. As shown in Figure 22, supervision was on average the fourth highest transport costs&#13;
for hospitals and the second highest transport cost for AHC but was the lowest for RHC and nil&#13;
for NAP.&#13;
&#13;
On average, hospitals made 5 supervision trips per year, AHC made 10, and RHC made 1.&#13;
There was significant variation between provinces. Taro, which is based in Choiseul where there&#13;
is only one AHC, conducted the most supervision trips of any hospital (14). Two church&#13;
hospitals (Atoifi and HGH), and Buala, did not conduct any supervision trips. For AHC the&#13;
number of trips varied from 35 in Guadalcanal to zero in Makira and Temotu (the sole AHC in&#13;
Temotu is based on an outer island, approximately 80km from the provincial capital).&#13;
&#13;
The cost of an average supervision trip was SBD 7,400 for hospitals, SBD 3,717 for AHC, and&#13;
SBD 562 for RHC. Lata, Taro and Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi reported above average costs per supervision trips&#13;
(SBD 30,000, SBD 18,000 and SBD 9,250 respectively), and Taro and Lata reported above&#13;
average total costs (SBD 252,000 and SBD 120,000 respectively), as shown in Figure 23. AHC&#13;
in Malaita averaged the highest cost per supervision trip, SBD 13,713 and, as shown in Figure&#13;
24, the overall highest cost per year, SBD 48,570, which may be because AHC are likely to&#13;
supervise a higher number of RHC and NAP and thus need to take longer supervision trips. On&#13;
average there is one AHC for every 10 RHC and NAP across the country, however in Malaita&#13;
there is one AHC for every 17 RHC and NAP.&#13;

&#13;
As shown in Figure 22, transport to collect drugs was on average the fifth highest transport cost&#13;
for hospitals and AHC, and the third highest transport cost for RHC and NAP. Facilities reported&#13;
the cost of return trips to collect drugs, which may include:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ For facilities that are supplied by an SLMS: the cost of transport from the SLMS to the&#13;
        facility;&#13;
    â&#128;¢ For facilities that are SLMS: the cost of collecting drugs from another SLMS; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢ For facilities that are supplied directly by the NMS in HCC and Guadalcanal, as well as&#13;
        outer islands: the cost of collecting drugs from the NMS when deliveries are not made.&#13;
&#13;
Less than half of hospitals reported undertaking trips to collect drugs, with an average of 4 trips&#13;
at SBD 704 per trip. Tulagi and GSH, which receive supplies directly from the NMS, reported&#13;
the highest number of trips to collect drugs, 24 and 12 respectively. The other three church&#13;
hospitals, Atoifi, HGH and Sasamuga all reported undertaking trips from the facility to collect&#13;
medical supplies.&#13;
&#13;
AHC recorded the most trips to collect drugs, 7 on average, with RHC averaging 4 and NAP&#13;
averaging 3. AHC in Honiara averaged the most trips (24), but these were also the cheapest per&#13;
trip (SBD 67 versus the average of SBD 591 per trip) given the facilities are located in close&#13;
proximity as the NMS, which is where they collect their drugs from. AHC in Malaita reported&#13;
the highest cost per trip to collect drugs (SBD 3,040) and the highest total cost of trips to collect&#13;
drugs (SBD 19,680 versus the average of SBD 3,915). RHC in Guadalcanal reported a low&#13;
number of trips to collect drugs (1.2), but the highest cost per trip (SBD 1,846 versus the average&#13;
of SBD 481) and the highest total cost of trips to collect drugs (SBD 3,692 versus the average of&#13;
SBD 1,883). NAP in Temotu reported taking the highest number of trips to collect drugs (6), the&#13;
highest average cost per trip (SBD 630 versus an average of SBD 320) and the highest total cost&#13;
of trips to collect drugs (SBD 2,910 versus the average of SBD 1,313).&#13;
&#13;
A small proportion of facilities reported undertaking trips to collect money. Tulagi was the only&#13;
hospital to report undertaking trips to collect money: 4 trips a year costing SBD 1,250 per trip.&#13;
AHC in Malaita and Western, RHC in Central, Choiseul and Malaita and NAP in Guadalcanal&#13;
also reported undertaking trips to collect money, with an average cost per trip of SBD 142 for&#13;
AHC, SBD 28 for RHC and SBD 38 for NAP.&#13;

2.1.5 Utilities (electricity and water)&#13;
&#13;
Most facilities that have adequate energy and water have relatively low utility costs given the&#13;
high proportion of facilities fitted with solar power, water tanks and/or piped water. These cost&#13;
estimates are presented in Figure 25 to Figure 30 and in more detail in Appendix A, Table 8 to&#13;
Table 12.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 25 shows the proportion of AHC, RHC and NAP with adequate power and water based&#13;
on the assessment of health workers responding to the HFS. While almost all hospitals reported&#13;
having adequate power (91%), on average only 44% of AHC, 33% of RHC and 16% of NAP did.&#13;
A much lower proportion of hospitals (36%) reported having adequate water, but a higher&#13;
proportion of AHC (59%), RHC (37%) and NAP (38%) reported having adequate water relative&#13;
to power, although the proportion is still low. HCC was the only province in which more than&#13;
half of AHC, RHC and NAP reported having adequate water and power.&#13;

&#13;
Notwithstanding the adequacy of the power supply, costs were applied for power sourced from&#13;
town supply and/or generators, and a zero cost was assumed for facilities relying solely on solar&#13;
or with no power (although some maintenance cost would be used for the upkeep).&#13;
&#13;
Figure 26 shows the proportion of hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP using different types of power&#13;
sources. Close to half of AHC and NAP and three quarters of RHC rely solely on solar panels&#13;
whereas close to three quarters of hospitals (all provincial hospitals) rely on town power supply&#13;
to some extent. A high proportion of NAP (39%) also reported having no power, but this&#13;
proportion was smaller for RHC (14%) and AHC (10%).&#13;
&#13;
Electricity costs are presented in Figure 27 for hospitals and Figure 28 for AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;
As shown in Figure 27 there is some variation in energy costs between hospitals Sasamunga was&#13;
the only hospital not using town or generator power. The average total electricity cost was SBD&#13;
403,986 for hospitals per year (compared to SBD 11.2 million for the NRH). Gizo had the&#13;
highest estimated electricity cost (SBD 1.4 million), which was based on bills from the Solomon&#13;
Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) and did not include any arrears payments.&#13;

Power sources and the associated cost varied in different provinces for lower level facilities. All&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP in Choiseul, Isabel, Malaita, Makira and Temotu with power relied solely&#13;
on solar, except for 25% of AHC in Malaita that also used town supply. Thus there is a zero cost&#13;
for facilities in these provinces. AHC, RHC and NAP in Guadalcanal, Central and Western used&#13;
a combination of generator and solar, except for 26% of AHC in Western that also used town&#13;
supply. All facilities in HCC used town supply. As shown in Figure 28, the average cost of&#13;
power was SBD 26,881 for AHC, SBD 12,636 for RHC and SBD 5,064 for NAP&#13;

Figure 29 shows the proportion of hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP using different types of water&#13;
sources. A similar pattern is present: 81% of AHC, 91% of RHC and 97% of NAP rely&#13;
predominantly on tank, piped and/or bore water sources, whereas 55% of hospitals use town&#13;
water to some extent. Again there are differences between provinces; only facilities in HCC,&#13;
some AHC and RHC in Western used town water to some extent.&#13;

A cost was applied to town water and a zero cost was assumed for facilities relying solely on&#13;
tank, piped or bore water (although some maintenance cost would be used for the upkeep). The&#13;
Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) is only responsible for town water in HCC, Auki (the&#13;
capital of Malaita where Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi hospital is based) and Tulagi (the capital of Central where&#13;
Tulagi hospital is based). In other provinces, the provincial government is responsible for the&#13;
town water supply and have the authority to charge a water supply tax. Based on a review of&#13;
PHO expenditure records, only HCC and Temotu have recorded water related costs. The cost of&#13;
town water supply has nonetheless been costed for facilities in all provinces that use town water&#13;
to reflect the actual cost.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 30 shows the estimated cost for the hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP in HCC and AHC&#13;
and RHC in Western that use town water. The average cost of town water supply was SBD&#13;
&#13;

2.1.6 Maintenance&#13;
&#13;
As explained in the Technical Annex a standard maintenance cost of 5.1% of expenditure from&#13;
provincial health service grants was applied per facility. This percentage is based on total&#13;
expenditure on repairs and maintenance as a proportion of total recurrent expenditure from&#13;
provincial health service grants in 2012 and 2013 for provinces for which data are available. 68&#13;
Thus maintenance costs were estimated by calculating 5.1% of the expenditure from provincial&#13;
health service grants that are included in this facility costing: DWE staffing, other supplies for&#13;
hospitals, transport and utilities.&#13;
&#13;
The average estimated maintenance cost was SBD 52,050 for hospitals, SBD 17,956 for AHC,&#13;
SBD 6,459 for RHC and SBD 2,918 for NAP (compared to SBD 793,151 for the NRH). These&#13;
costs are presented by province and facility type in the Section 2.1.7 and presented in detail in&#13;
Appendix A, Table 13.&#13;

2.1.7 Recurrent costs per facility summary&#13;
&#13;
The estimated average annual recurrent costs per facility are shown in Figure 31 to Figure 35 for&#13;
hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP and presented in detail in Appendix A, Table 14.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 31 compares the average cost across facility types. While there is significant variation&#13;
between facility types, staff was the major cost for all facility levels (including the NRH),&#13;
varying from 69% of recurrent costs at RHC to 51% or recurrent costs at hospitals and AHC.&#13;
The next highest costs (excluding the NRH) were medical supplies and freight supplies, which&#13;
varied from 32% at AHC to 16% at RHC (and 8% at the NRH). Together these two costs,&#13;
staffing and drugs supplies, constituted an average of 80% of the total recurrent costs at hospitals,&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;

2.1.8 Recurrent costs by facility type and province&#13;
&#13;
The total annual recurrent costs per facility type and province are shown in Figure 36 to Figure&#13;
38, and detailed in Appendix A, Table 15 and Table 16. The total recurrent cost for all facilities&#13;
is estimated to be just under SBD 231 million, of which 44% is spent at the NRH, as shown in&#13;
Figure 36. The remaining is spent on provincial and church hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;

Figure 38 shows the total recurrent costs per province (including hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP&#13;
but excluding the NRH), which range from SBD 6.4 million in Temotu to SBD 34.4 million in&#13;
Malaita. The total cost per province, excluding the NRH, were used to estimate the cost per&#13;
capita in each province, which varied SBD 128 in Guadalcanal to SBD 350 in Western, as&#13;
shown in Figure 37. Alternative costs per province including NRH cost distribution were also&#13;
calculated, based on the number of formal referrals to the NRH reported by all facilities in each&#13;
province in the Health Information System in 2012, as also shown in Figure 37. 69 The estimated&#13;
cost per capita, varied from SBD 128 in Guadalcanal to SBD 350 in Western, and SBD 229 in&#13;
HCC. However, including the NRH, total recurrent spending per capita varied between SBD 300&#13;
in Temotu to SBD 515 in Central, and SBD 927 in HCC (inclusive of the SBD 229 per capita&#13;
spent in HCC and SBD 698 spent at the NRH on HCC residents). 70&#13;

   The NRH costs were distributed to the provinces based on the proportion of formal referrals from each province&#13;
to the NRH in 2012 as recorded in the HIS. Data for Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi were imputed based on nine months of data for 2013&#13;
as no data was available for 2012. Renbel costs were excluded. The HIS data does not include self-referrals.&#13;
70&#13;
   The analysis of the HIS data found that 45% of the referrals from the provinces to the NRH were from HCC.&#13;

2.2. NRH&#13;
&#13;
Figure 39 presents a summary of the recurrent costs incurred at the NRH. The largest cost at the&#13;
NRH was staffing (60%), followed by electricity (11%) and then medical supplies (8%); this is&#13;
in contrast to the other hospitals and facilities where medical supplies were the second largest&#13;
expenditure followed by transport.&#13;

&#13;
In 2013 there was a total of 621 staff employed at the NRH, of which 497 were clinical staff.&#13;
This includes 73 doctors, 236 nurses and 85 nurse aids (see Figure 40). Nearly 20% of all staff&#13;
were non-clinical, assuming administrative, domestic or other roles (see Figure 41). Figure 42&#13;
presents the number and type of staff in each clinical and administrative area 71 and the total&#13;
salary and allowance cost of these staff in each section. 72 The salary cost estimates were based&#13;
on 2013 figures provided by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, and do not take into account&#13;
proposed increases to doctor salaries due to come into effect in 2014. All employees were full&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
Electricity was the next highest cost at the NRH; the estimates above are based on the SIEA bill.&#13;
The high cost of electricity at the NRH may be due to use of electricity by staff residing in the&#13;
nearby staff compound; there is one electricity meter for the NRH and the compound. The water&#13;
costs were based on the SIWA bills. The NRH may be paying an inflated cost for water due to a&#13;
broken water meter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
71&#13;
  Staff were allocated to outpatient clinics if they worked in those clinics for more than 20 hours a week.&#13;
72&#13;
  To maintain anonymity of the staff the costs of staff by type (e.g.: doctor, nurse etc) and section have not been&#13;
presented. For example, there is only one doctor in the laboratory and one nurse aid in the imaging departments.&#13;
They are available on request.&#13;

Figure 43 to Figure 46 present the average annual number of services provided by hospitals,&#13;
Area Health Centres (AHC), Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and Nurse Aid Posts (NAP) by&#13;
province and service type, based on the data available from the Health Information System&#13;
(HIS). 78 Greater detail is provided in Appendix A, Table 17 to Table 20.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 43 shows the average annual number of patient contacts for:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Inpatients;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Outpatients (including new, return and chronic outpatient visits, as well as family planning,&#13;
   maternal health and child welfare visits in the clinic); and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Outreach (including antenatal, postnatal and child welfare contacts on tour) per facility.&#13;
This data were extracted from the HIS, except for the National Referral Hospital (NRH), which&#13;
does not report to the HIS.&#13;

Hospitals served an average of 1,054 inpatients and 14,735 outpatients in 2012. Figure 44 shows&#13;
the number of inpatient admissions and outpatient visits per year. Kilu'ufi had the highest&#13;
number of inpatients (2,800), but an average number of outpatients (11,569 compared to an&#13;
average of 14,735). The relatively lower number of outpatients at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi is likely due to the&#13;
fact that there is an AHC in Auki (the capital of Malaita where Kilu'ufi is based), which patients&#13;
are encouraged to attend before the hospital and where all family planning, antenatal, postnatal&#13;
and child welfare clinics take place. Good Samaritan Hospital (GSH) had the highest number of&#13;
outpatients (28,479).&#13;
&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP provide limited inpatient services: inpatients at these facilities, particularly&#13;
RHC and NAP, are likely to either be deliveries, patients who are waiting for transport for&#13;
referral, or patients who are waiting until they are well enough to travel home. An average of&#13;
144 admissions per year was made by AHC, 48 by RHC and 14 by NAP. Figure 45, which&#13;
shows average inpatient and outpatient services per facility by province and facility type,&#13;

&#13;
indicates that there was some variation. AHC in Malaita, Western and Temotu had a greater&#13;
average number of admissions (344, 243 and 203 respectively). Makira had a low number of&#13;
admissions at AHC, but the reverse at RHC and NAP.&#13;
&#13;
On average AHC performed 12,078 outpatient consultations in 2012, RHC performed 4,970 and&#13;
NAP performed 1,831. Although most AHC, RHC and NAP in Honiara City Council (HCC) do&#13;
not admit inpatients, they provide a higher volume of outpatient services compared with AHC,&#13;
RHC and NAP in other provinces. There was greater consistency across the other provinces,&#13;
although still some variation. AHC in Western and Temotu 80 average over 9,500 outpatient&#13;
visits per year, more than double the number provided by AHC in Makira. Similarly, RHC in&#13;
Malaita average close to double the number of outpatient visits compared to those in Isabel and&#13;
Choiseul.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 46 shows the number of outreach contacts (for antenatal, postnatal and child welfare) by&#13;
facility type. 81 As shown Figure 46, hospitals average the highest number of outreach contacts&#13;
(146) followed by RHC (44), AHC (33), and NAP (3).&#13;

The recurrent costs described above in Section 2 were allocated to inpatient, outpatient and&#13;
outreach services as per the method set out in the Technical Annex. The results of this analysis&#13;
are presented in Figure 47 to Figure 50.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 47 show the average proportion of costs spent on inpatient, outpatient and outreach&#13;
services. As shown in Figure 47, while 76% of recurrent costs are spent on inpatient services at&#13;
hospitals (compared to 71% at the NRH); 67% of recurrent costs are spent on outpatient services&#13;
at AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;

&#13;
Figure 48 shows the average cost of inpatient admissions and outpatient visits by facility type.&#13;
Note that the average costs in the NRH and hospitals is higher on average than in the lower level&#13;
facilities, as there is no doctor at lower level facilities, and they use less energy intensive&#13;
resources at AHC, RHC and NAP. The average $5.6 million in recurrent costs for hospitals was&#13;
spent as follows: SBD 4.3 million or 76% of recurrent costs were expended on inpatient services,&#13;
SBD 1.2 million or 22% on outpatient services and SBD 112,891 or 2% on outreach. This&#13;
equates to average costs of SBD 4,045 per inpatient admission at hospitals; an outpatient visit&#13;
costs, on average SBD 91 at hospitals; and an outreach contact costs SBD 775.&#13;
&#13;
The average cost per inpatient admission and outpatient visit is shown per hospital in Figure 49.&#13;
The highest cost per inpatient admission was at Gizo (SBD 8,347), whereas the lowest was at&#13;
GSH (SBD 1,643). The cost of inpatients at Gizo, which was higher than the NRH, was due to&#13;
the relatively higher cost of each recurrent cost input. For example, as shown in Figure 32, Gizo&#13;
and Kirakira, which have a similar number of annual inpatient admissions (see Figure 44), spend&#13;
a very similar proportion on each recurrent cost input. Yet the cost of all inpatient services at&#13;
Gizo was SBD 10.2 million, whereas it was SBD 4.9 million at Kirakira, and Gizo has a slightly&#13;
less inpatients than Kirakira (1,217 and 1,241 respectively).&#13;
&#13;
The highest cost for outpatient visit was at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi (SBD 289), whereas the lowest was at&#13;
Sasamuga (SBD 10). In addition to Sasamuga, the estimated cost per outpatient visit at GSH&#13;

&#13;
(SBD 17) was estimated to be less than the average cost for RHC and NAP. While these two&#13;
hospitals do not have doctors, they conduct a much higher number of outpatient visits, they have&#13;
a much higher number of outpatient visits (8,713 and 28,479 respectively) than RHC and NAP&#13;
(4,970 and 1,831 respectively), which reduces the average cost per visit. The highest outreach&#13;
contact cost was at Gizo (SBD 1,631), whereas the lowest was at Sasamuga (SBD 62).&#13;

The average estimated annual recurrent cost for AHC of SBD 884,536 breaks down to SBD&#13;
281,028 (32%) for inpatient services, SBD 592,063 (67%) for outpatient services and SBD&#13;
11,445 (1%) for outreach services. This equates to average costs of SBD 2,489 per inpatient&#13;
admission; SBD 60 per outpatient visit; and SBD 1,090 per outreach contact.&#13;
&#13;
The average estimated recurrent cost for RHC was SBD 232,528. This breaks down to SBD&#13;
43,685 (19%) for inpatient services, SBD 181,643 (78%) for outpatient services and SBD 7,200&#13;
(3%) for outreach services. On average at RHC an inpatient admission costs SBD 2,160; an&#13;
outpatient visit costs SBD 46; and an outreach contact costs SBD 156.&#13;
&#13;
The average estimated recurrent cost for NAP was SBD 90,447. This breaks down to SBD&#13;
21,906 (24%) for inpatient services, SBD 67,847 (75%) for outpatient services and SBD 694&#13;
(1%) for outreach services. On average at NAP an inpatient admission costs SBD 2,753; an&#13;
outpatient visit costs SBD 43; and an outreach contact costs SBD 203. The high cost of&#13;
admissions at NAP (relative to RHC), is likely due to the smaller number of admissions. The&#13;
cost per inpatient admission and outpatient visit for AHC, RHC and NAP is shown by province&#13;
in Figure 50.&#13;

3.2 Service costs at the NRH&#13;
&#13;
Figure 51 reports the number of inpatient admissions at the NRH in 2012. 85 Over half of the&#13;
activity at the NRH was related to childbirth (51%), on the antenatal and postnatal wards,&#13;
although these patients had the shortest length of stay (LOS). Gynaecology and surgery were the&#13;
next most populous wards. The tuberculosis and rehabilitation wards had the longest lengths of&#13;
stay.&#13;

   Inpatient activity at the NRH is reported using a bed census; this reports on a daily basis (with monthly&#13;
summaries) the throughput in each ward (admissions, discharges, transfers in and out and deaths). A monthly&#13;
summary and an annual summary of the bed census for 2012 are available; these differ somewhat, but not&#13;
significantly. The average of these two sources is presented in Figure 51.&#13;

   There is no collation of outpatient attendances in the NRH, but a review of all the registers in the various clinics&#13;
by the study team allowed for an estimate of the number of outpatient attendances at the NRH.&#13;

   The Emergency Department at the NRH is also referred to the General Outpatients Department.&#13;

   Complete 2013 figures were not available, these are for 2012. Includes: Surgical, Paediatrics, Orthopaedics, and&#13;

The cost of referrals at the NRH is presented in Figure 53 by province and Figure 54 by ward.&#13;
The NRH Accounts department maintains detailed records on patient referrals where the NRH&#13;
paid for the return voyage (that is an oneway fare to repatriate the patient). 91 These records were&#13;
obtained for a 10 month period in 2013. During this time there were 2,894 referrals from all&#13;
provinces except HCC (which suggests there are 3,472 referrals annually, excluding HCC 92),&#13;
and the average size of a referral party was 1.76 (that is the patient and most of the time one&#13;
other). The average cost of referral (oneway fare to repatriate the patient) was SBD 686.&#13;
&#13;
The province to which the highest number patients were being returned to was Malaita&#13;
(33%); the highest provincial average cost was the fare to Temotu (SBD 1,311). The ward with&#13;
the highest number of patients being returned to their home province was Emergency (15%),&#13;
followed by Gynaecology (11%) and Orthopaedics (11%).&#13;
&#13;
Imputing for referrals from HCC, (2,092 were recorded in the HIS for 2012), an estimated 5,564&#13;
patients are referred to the NRH annually. In the unlikely circumstance that all of these referred&#13;
patients, whether they are referred to an inpatient ward or outpatient clinic, end up being&#13;
admitted, formal referrals account for a maximum of 44% of all inpatient admissions at the NRH.&#13;
In contrast, 18% of admissions in the sample from inpatient case notes were recorded as referrals.&#13;

  No data were available on international referrals.&#13;
92&#13;
  This excludes referrals from HCC to the NRH (2,092 annually according to the HIS). By comparison, the number&#13;
of emergency and non-emergency referrals to the NRH recorded in the HIS in 2012 was 4,671 (adjusted for&#13;
Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi), or 2,578 excluding HCC. Thus, excluding HCC, the accounts register has (for 10 months in 2013) a&#13;
greater number of referrals than the HIS for 2012. This may be due to: (i) the fact that the NRH pays for some&#13;
patients who do not go through the formal referral process; (ii) the incompleteness of data in the HIS; or (iii) an&#13;
increase in referrals between 2012 and 2013.&#13;

Using the allocation rules detailed in the Technical Annex it was possible to allocate the&#13;
recurrent costs detailed in Figure 39 to the inpatient and outpatient services. Figure 55 presents&#13;
the breakdown of total recurrent inpatient, outpatient and outreach costs. Also presented is the&#13;
number of services (outputs), and the cost per output. The cost of an inpatient admission at the&#13;
NRH was SBD 5,772 (see Figure 51 for length of stay). The cost of an outpatient attendance was&#13;
SBD 459. Note that in the NRH expenditure breakdown there is a budget line for â&#128;&#152;tours and&#13;
travelâ&#128;&#153;, which was assumed to represent outreach. Further information was not available&#13;
regarding what outreach services were offered and how many. 93 Outreach makes up a very&#13;
small proportion of the NRH budget (SBD 402,928 0.40%).&#13;

&#13;
3.3 Major outpatient conditions&#13;
&#13;
The outpatient conditions and cost by condition are summarised in Figure 56 and Figure 57 and&#13;
presented in detail in Appendix A, Tables 21 to 25. Average outpatient presentations at the NRH,&#13;
hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP are presented below in Figure 56 based on the International&#13;
Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Reasons for presentation were first coded as International&#13;
Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2), which is a coding system used in primary care. Patient&#13;
presentations by ICPC-2 codes are shown in Appendix A Table 21 and Table 23. ICPC-2 codes&#13;
were then converted to ICD-10 codes, which are more commonly used when presenting disease&#13;
based costings. ICD-10 codes are also presented here so the proportion and cost of outpatient&#13;
attendances can be compared to inpatient admissions, which are always coded using ICD-10.&#13;
&#13;
At the NRH emergency department (general outpatients) and NAP the most common reason for&#13;
outpatient presentation was signs and symptoms of circulatory and respiratory diseases (16% and&#13;
11% respectively). 94 This was also the second most common reason for presentation at AHC&#13;
and the third at RHC.&#13;
&#13;
The most common reason for outpatient presentation at hospitals, AHC and RHC and the third&#13;
most common reason at NAP was child welfare visits. Like antenatal, postnatal, and family&#13;
planning visits, these visits often take place at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP, but not the NRH.&#13;
The second most common reason for outpatient presentations at hospitals and RHC, and the&#13;
fourth most common reason at AHC and NAP were upper acute respiratory infections (ARI).&#13;
Upper ARI represented 9% of outpatient presentations at hospitals and 9% at AHC, RHC and&#13;
NAP on average. There is considerable variation across the levels of the health care system,&#13;
which reflects the different levels of patient severity expected to present at each facility type.&#13;
Hospitals have a high number of presentations for skin infections, while the NRH has a high&#13;
number of presentations for gastroenteritis/diarrhoea.&#13;
&#13;
The cost per disease was also found to differ. Every disease was found to be more expensive to&#13;
treat in the NRH than any other facility type. This variation is in part due to the cost inputs,&#13;
higher staff costs, but also about the number of presentations and the type of presentation. For&#13;
example the cost by condition at RHC and NAP is on average very similar, this is likely to be a&#13;
result of these two facilities seeing similar proportions of cases and having similar input costs.&#13;
AHC on the other hand, have higher disease costs, which is likely to be a consequence of seeing&#13;
more severe cases.&#13;
&#13;
Only outpatient presentations from the NRH emergency department are included in this analysis.&#13;
Limited information was available for other clinics, but they were costed based on what was&#13;
available. The Obstetrics and Gynaecology clinic costs SBD 461 per consultation; Consultant&#13;
clinic costs SBD 461 per consultation; the Fracture clinic costs SBD 459 per consultation;&#13;
diabetes in the NCD clinic costs SBD 454 per consultation; hypertension in the NCD clinic costs&#13;
SBD 455 per consultation; the Eye clinic costs SBD 447 per consultation; and the ENT clinic&#13;
costs SBD 449 per consultation.&#13;
94&#13;
  Signs and symptoms of circulatory and respiratory conditions include presentations for abnormal heart beat,&#13;
abnormal blood pressure (without diagnosis), cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, throat pain, etc.&#13;

3.4 Major inpatient conditions&#13;
&#13;
The inpatient conditions and cost by condition are summarised in Figure 58 to Figure 59 and&#13;
presented in detail in Appendix A, Tables 26 to 28.&#13;
&#13;
Reasons for inpatient presentations at hospitals, AHC, RHC and NAP are presented below in&#13;
Figure 58 based on ICD-10 codes.&#13;
&#13;
As shown in Figure 58, (uncomplicated) delivery was the main reason for admission at all&#13;
facility levels, except for the NRH. At the NRH complications of labour and delivery were the&#13;
most common reason for admission, accounting for 24% of admissions, and (uncomplicated)&#13;
deliveries were the second highest, accounting for 21% of admissions. Diseases in the perinatal&#13;
period and maternal care were the third and sixth highest reasons for admission at the NRH,&#13;
accounting for 7% and 4% of admissions respectively. Diseases of the genitourinary system&#13;
were the fourth most common reason for admission at the NRH (6%).&#13;
&#13;
Deliveries accounted for 29% of admissions at hospitals, 14% at AHC, 36% at RHC and 42% at&#13;
NAP. There was some variation between provinces: in Malaita and Western a greater proportion&#13;
of admissions were deliveries at the hospitals (46% and 38% respectively) and a smaller&#13;
proportion of admissions were due to deliveries at AHC (10% and 5% respectively), and also for&#13;
RHC (13%) and NAP (6%) in Malaita. The reverse is true in Isabel, Central, Makira and Temotu.&#13;
&#13;
Injury was the second highest reason for admission at hospitals (8%), the fourth highest at AHC&#13;
(7%) and the fifth highest at the NRH (5%). With respect to NCD, on average, diabetes&#13;
accounted for less than 1.5% of admissions at all facility levels and diseases of the circulatory&#13;
system including hypertension accounted for less than 3%.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to infectious diseases, pneumonia was the third most common reason for admission&#13;
at hospitals (7%), and the second most common reason for admission at AHC (10%), RHC (15%)&#13;
and NAP (13%). Acute ARI was the third most common reason for admission at AHC (8%) and&#13;
NAP (8%), although it accounted for less than 2.1% of presentations at hospital and the RHC.&#13;
Malaria was the third most common reason for admission at RHC (9%), the fourth highest at&#13;
NAP (7%) and fifth highest at AHC (7%). Diarrhoea and skin infections also accounted for&#13;
between 1-6% of admissions at AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 59 shows the average cost of admissions by ICD code and facility type. Tuberculosis had&#13;
the highest average cost per admission, ranging from SBD 40,344 at the NRH to SBD 1,266 at&#13;
NAP. The high cost is primarily due to the length of stay, which is 70 days at the NRH.&#13;
Similarly diabetes also has a high cost per admission, ranging from SBD 26,465 at the NRH to&#13;
SBD 1,073 at RHC, as well as diseases of the circulatory system including hypertension, ranging&#13;
from SBD 18,348 at the NRH to SBD 1,399 at RHC. There is a much lower cost per admission&#13;
at the NRH for deliveries (SBD 2,250) relative to tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension and other&#13;
diseases, although the cost is more comparable at AHC, RHC and NAP.&#13;
&#13;

4. Patient costs&#13;
4.1 Demographics&#13;
&#13;
The Patient Exit Survey (PES) was conducted with 698 respondents at all levels of the health&#13;
system to estimate the out of pocket costs incurred by patients. The results of the PES were&#13;
weighted, as described in the Technical Annex, to be representative of the outpatient population.&#13;
The weighted results are shown in Figure 60 to Figure 72, and in greater detail in Appendix A,&#13;
Tables 29 to Table 30. The average age of respondents was 33 years 97 and 61% were female.&#13;
Most respondents had recently visited a health facility as a patient or a carer (90%), although&#13;
some respondents were in proximity to a health centre (if insufficient patients were at the facility)&#13;
and related their experience of a recent visit to a facility (10%).&#13;
&#13;
The socio-economic status of the respondents was ranked using 11 dwelling and asset questions&#13;
that were also included in the 2013 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). 98 If the&#13;
PES survey sample was representative of the population of Solomon Islands, then 20% of&#13;
surveyed patients would be in each quintile. This was not the case, as shown in Figure 60. There&#13;
was an under-representation in the poorest or first quintile (12%) and wealthiest or fifth quintile&#13;
(13%) and greater representation from individuals classified as being in the second (33%), third&#13;
(24%) of fourth (19%) wealth quintiles. This may be for a number of reasons. As shown in&#13;
Figure 60 and Figure 61, wealth quintiles were correlated with both facility type and province. 99&#13;

&#13;
The correlation between wealth quintile and facility type and province suggests that the poorest&#13;
quintile may be underrepresented as a result of the sample. This relationship could not be&#13;
investigated further as the full results of the HIES were not available at the time this report was&#13;
submitted; however efforts were made to control for the relationship using a regression which is&#13;
presented in Appendix A.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to education, most respondents had finished primary school (34%) or the first four&#13;
(27%) or five (19%) years of secondary school, as shown in Figure 62. In total, 87% of&#13;
respondents had some level of primary or secondary education. 100&#13;

Most respondents were visiting the facility primarily to receive treatment (70%) or to&#13;
accompany a child (23%), yet the reasons varied across facility types, provinces and wealth&#13;
quintiles. A greater proportion of respondents from the NRH, in Honiara City Council (HCC)&#13;
and the wealthiest quintile were receiving laboratory results (86%, 22% and 19% respectively,&#13;
compared to the average of 4%) and undergoing minor surgery (62%, 16% and 11% respectively,&#13;
compared to the average of 6%). A greater proportion of respondents were giving birth at&#13;
hospitals (11% compared to the average of 2%) and having their child immunised at AHC and&#13;
RHC (14% and 19%, compared to an average of 11%). Figure 63 shows how the reasons for&#13;
visiting the facility vary across by facility type.&#13;
&#13;
Most respondents chose the facility that they visited because it was the closest to home (71%),&#13;
there was no other option (35%), it has good service (28%) or it usually had drugs available&#13;
(23%). Again, reasons differed by facility type, province and wealth quintiles. A smaller&#13;
proportion of respondents at the NRH, hospitals, and HCC, reported that they chose the facility&#13;
because it was the closest to home (34%, 51% and 53% respectively, compared to an average of&#13;
71%). Fewer respondents at the NRH, hospitals, HCC and those in the wealthiest quintile also&#13;
reported that they chose the facility because there was no other option (24%, 27%, 18% and 13%&#13;
respectively, compared to an average of 35%). Conversely, a greater proportion of respondents&#13;
at the NRH reported that they chose the facility because drugs were available (100%, compared&#13;
to an average of 23%) or they gave good service (72%, compared to an average of 28%). A&#13;
greater proportion of respondents at the NRH and in the wealthiest quintile also reported that&#13;
they were referred (86% and 17% respectively, compared to an average of 8%) or wanted to see&#13;
the health worker present (79% and 25% respectively, compared to an average of 11%). Figure&#13;
64 shows how reasons for choosing the facility vary across by facility type.&#13;
&#13;
100&#13;
   This is greater than the figures reported in the most recent census, in which 76% of the population had primary or&#13;
secondary education. See: SIG (2009), above footnote 14.&#13;

4.2 Travel and waiting times&#13;
&#13;
Figure 65 presents the average time spent travelling to the facility, waiting at the facility and&#13;
seeing the health worker. 103 The average travel time to facilities was 57 minutes; the highest&#13;
average travel time in Guadalcanal province (110 minutes), the lowest average travel time was in&#13;
Central (21 minutes). There was a longer average travel time to the NRH (125 minutes) and&#13;
hospitals (113 minutes) compared to AHC (41 minutes), RHC (38 minutes) and NAP (44&#13;
minutes). Those in the poorest quintile reported the highest average travel time to reach&#13;
facilities (82 minutes), compared to the wealthiest (20 minutes). This suggests the earlier&#13;
reported under representation in the poorest quintile may be due to accessibility.&#13;
&#13;
The average wait time to see a health worker was 34 minutes, with the highest wait time in HCC&#13;
(51 minutes) and the lowest wait time in Temotu (9 minutes). There was also a greater waiting&#13;
time at the NRH (108 minutes) and hospitals (64 minutes), compared to AHC (27 minutes),&#13;
RHC (27 minutes) and NAP (17 minutes). There was no significant difference in wait times&#13;
across wealth quintiles.&#13;
&#13;
The average time spent with a health worker was 12 minutes, with the longest time with a health&#13;
worker was in Malaita (21 minutes) and the lowest in Makira (5 minutes). The average time&#13;
spent with a health worker varied from 7 minutes at an AHC to 18 minutes at a RHC. There was&#13;
no significant difference in time spent with a health worker across wealth quintiles.&#13;
&#13;
Walking was the main mode of transport to the facility (average 72%) in all provinces, facility&#13;
types and wealth quintiles, except for respondents in HCC who were more like to travel via bus&#13;
and respondents at the NRH who were more likely to travel via taxi, bus and boat with outboard&#13;
motor. A greater proportion of those in the poorest quintile reported that they walked to the&#13;
facility (86%), compared to those in the richest quintile (53%). These results are shown in Figure&#13;
66.&#13;

The proportion of respondents who were asked to pay varied from 76% in Makira to 10% in&#13;
Central, and the proportion of respondents who did pay varied from 77% in Makira to 23% in&#13;
Choiseul. The average contribution varied between provinces from SBD 5.37 in Guadalcanal to&#13;
SBD 1.94 in Makira.&#13;
&#13;
A higher proportion of respondents at NAP (40%), AHC (38%) and RHC (36%) and were asked&#13;
to pay, compared with the NRH (10%) and hospitals (26%). Respondents at NAP (46%) and&#13;
105&#13;
    The Health Services Act (1979) permits for the collection of fees at hospitals, but does not currently permit their&#13;
collection at lower level facilities. See: the Health Services Act (1979), sections 4, 8 and 17. Available at:&#13;
www.paclii.org/sb/legis/consol_act/hsa161/hsa161.html. Section 4 states that â&#128;&#156;the services so provided shall be free&#13;
of charge except in-so-far as the Minister, acting in accordance with the provisions of this Act, may make Rules&#13;
authorising or prescribing charges for such services.â&#128;&#157; Section 8(d) gives the Minister power to issue regulations â&#128;&#156;for&#13;
the control of, and the payment of fees for, the use of facilities of public hospitals by private medical and dental&#13;
practitioners.â&#128;&#157; The subsidiary legislation and regulations provide a schedule for the collection of fees at the NRH&#13;
and hospitals. All fees that are collected are required to be placed into the consolidated fund under section 17(2).&#13;
106&#13;
    The results of the regression analysis show that province and facility type are significant for whether respondents&#13;
were asked to pay, whether respondents did pay and the amount that they paid. Wealth quintile is not significant.&#13;
107&#13;
    Not all patients who were asked to pay in fact paid, and some who were not asked to pay reported making a&#13;
payment.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        80&#13;

&#13;
AHC (42%) also more frequently made contributions. The average contribution varied from&#13;
SBD 5.99 at hospitals to zero at the NRH, where none of the 25 respondents to the PES reported&#13;
that they made a contribution. 108&#13;
&#13;
A higher proportion of those in the first, second and third quintiles made a contribution relative&#13;
to the fourth and fifth quintiles. Respondents in the highest wealth quintile paid more on average&#13;
(SBD 7.10) than respondents in other quintiles (although this was not statistically significant).&#13;
Wealth quintile was not significant in the regression analysis for whether respondents were&#13;
asked to pay, whether respondents did pay and the amount that they paid.&#13;
&#13;
The findings of the PES are consistent with those from the Health Facility Survey (HFS), which&#13;
recorded standard contributions collected for services and associated exemptions, as well as&#13;
contributions collected for medical record books. Figure 68 to Figure 70 present the&#13;
contributions that are requested for services and medical record books as reported by health&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
Facilities reported collecting contributions for both services and medical record books. Figure 68&#13;
shows the proportion of facilities collecting contributions for each service and the average&#13;
contribution collected.&#13;

   While the respondents to this study have reported no contributions for services at the NRH, it is widely known&#13;
that the NRH often charges fees for: medical tests (laboratory tests, x-rays and scans); embalming, morgue and&#13;
death certificates; specialist or dental consultations; dental and medical books, and forms. Furthermore, the MHMS&#13;
confirmed that private practitioners often use NRH facilities to treat their own private patients, for a fee that is kept&#13;
by the private practitioner.&#13;
&#13;
                                                           81&#13;

&#13;
Hospitals (55%) and AHC, RHC and NAP (70%) most commonly reported collecting&#13;
contributions for outpatients. A smaller proportion also collected contributions for inpatients (36%&#13;
of hospitals and 30% of AHC, RHC and NAP). For the facilities that collect contributions, the&#13;
average reported contribution for inpatients was SBD 19 at hospitals and SBD 8 at AHC, RHC&#13;
and NAP, with a lower average for outpatients of SBD 3 at hospitals and SBD 2 at AHC, RHC&#13;
and NAP. As shown in Figure 69 and Figure 70 the highest contributions for inpatient and&#13;
outpatient services were at Helena Goldie Hospital 109 â&#128;&#147; SBD 50 for inpatients and SBD 5 for&#13;
outpatients (Kirakira also charged SBD 5 for outpatients).&#13;
&#13;
Approximately 27% of hospitals and 32% of AHC, RHC and NAP also charge for deliveries.&#13;
While the contribution collected for deliveries at hospitals was less than that for inpatients (SBD&#13;
13 compared to SBD 19), it was considerably higher at AHC, RHC and NAP (SBD 13 compared&#13;
to SBD 8).&#13;
&#13;
All hospitals and over 50% of AHC, RHC and NAP collected contributions for medical record&#13;
books, motherâ&#128;&#153;s books, and baby books. The average cost of these books was slightly higher at&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP (SBD 12, SBD 11 and SBD 16), compared to hospitals (SBD 11, SBD 9&#13;
and SBD 11. Some hospitals (73%) and AHC, RHC and NAP (49%) also charged for antenatal&#13;
books. A smaller proportion charged for family planning books (9% of hospitals and 27% of&#13;
AHC, RHC and NAP) and sick leave requests (27% of hospitals and 12% of AHC, RHC and&#13;
NAP).&#13;
&#13;
Most respondents (86%) said that payments to the health facility had not dissuaded them from&#13;
visiting a health facility in the past (8% reported that payments to the health facility had&#13;
dissuaded them from visiting a health facility in the past, and 6% did not know; there was no&#13;
significant difference by wealth quintile). In the HFS, 45% of AHC, RHC and NAP and 18% of&#13;
hospitals reported offering exemptions to poor patients, patients not working, the disabled, the&#13;
elderly, and women, children and infants.&#13;
&#13;
Payments for medication were far less common than general payments to the health facility: 2%&#13;
were asked to pay for the medication, with an average of payment of SBD 0.95 requested (and a&#13;
maximum of SBD 10). In addition to cash contributions, 14% of respondents also reported&#13;
giving gifts of food or crops.&#13;
&#13;
Payments to the health facility were lower than payments to see a kastom (traditional) doctor; 29%&#13;
of respondents reported visiting a kastom doctor in the last year and 18% of respondents&#13;
reported making payment to the kastom doctor, with an average of SBD 59 (and a maximum of&#13;
SBD 300).&#13;
&#13;

   The high contributions at HGH are consistent with the statement of income and expenditure for HGH from June&#13;
to September 2013, in which patient fees accounts for 12% of HGHâ&#128;&#153;s income.&#13;

4.4 Direct non-health care and indirect costs&#13;
&#13;
Figure 71 sets out other patient costs, including travel and lost income. The average cost of&#13;
patient travel was SBD 29. Travel costs were highest in Isabel (SBD 47) and HCC (SBD 45) and&#13;
lowest in Makira (SBD 4) and Guadalcanal (SBD 10). Respondents paid more on average to&#13;
travel to the NRH (SBD 146), provincial and church hospitals (SBD 97) than AHC, RHC and&#13;
NAP. Those in the wealthiest quintile paid more (SBD 42) than other income groups. Most&#13;
respondents (87%) said that travel costs had not dissuaded them from visiting a health facility in&#13;
the past (7% reported that travel costs had dissuaded them from visiting a health facility in the&#13;
past, and 5% did not know).&#13;
&#13;
With respect to lost income, 10% 110 of respondents reported losing income as a result of their&#13;
health condition, with the average amount of lost income being SBD 649. Lost income was&#13;
highest in HCC (SBD 950) and lowest in Choiseul (SBD 54). Respondents at the NRH reported&#13;
losing more income (SBD 1,547) than those at all other facilities; respondents at NAP reported&#13;
losing SBD 136. Those in the poorest quintile reported losing less (SBD 75) than all other&#13;
quintiles, and those in the fourth quintile reported losing the most (SBD 1,062).&#13;
&#13;
Finally, with respect to other costs, respondents also reported that they brought water (55%) and&#13;
food (29%) with them to the facility, or purchased it (25%). Less than 10% of patients bought&#13;
bed sheets or other items with them to the facility.&#13;

4.5 Patient satisfaction&#13;
&#13;
As shown in Figure 72, overall 92% of PES respondents rated the service as good or very good&#13;
(that is across all services, in all facility types in all provinces). The main reasons for a good or&#13;
very good rating was the availability of medication (71%) and the diagnosis of the condition&#13;
(61%), followed by the friendliness of the health worker (51%) and the presence of the health&#13;
worker (26%). 113 The presence of the health worker was a more common reason for satisfaction&#13;
at the NRH (67%) than the average (26%), and diagnosis by health workers was a more common&#13;
response from those in the two poorest quintiles (70%) than the average (61%).&#13;
&#13;
The main variation in patient satisfaction was by facility type; 48% of respondents at the NRH&#13;
ranked the service as bad (45%) or very bad (3%), compared to 4% at hospitals and RHC, and 7%&#13;
at AHC and NAP. The main reason for dissatisfaction at the NRH and other facilities was the&#13;
long waiting times (100%), followed by the unfriendliness of the health worker (21%). Reasons&#13;
for dissatisfaction varied by province: the long wait time was the main reason for dissatisfaction&#13;
in HCC and Makira (92% and 93%, compared to an average of 78%); the lack of a diagnosis&#13;
was the main reason in Isabel (100%, compared to the average of 16%); the unavailability of&#13;
drugs was the main reason in Western (73%, compared to the average of 23%). There was&#13;
limited variation by wealth quintile.&#13;

5.1 Performance measures&#13;
&#13;
Key performance measures are presented in Figure 73 to Figure 78, and in greater detail in&#13;
Appendix A, Table 32 to 34.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 74 shows the key operating statistics, including the average length of stay (LOS), bed&#13;
occupancy rate (BOR) and bed turnover rate (inpatients per bed year) for the National Referral&#13;
Hospital (NRH), hospitals, Area Health Centres (AHC), Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and Nurse&#13;
Aid Posts (NAP). Figure 73 compares some of these measures to countries in the region.&#13;
&#13;
The average LOS varied from between 2 and 3 days at AHC, RHC and NAP to 6.5 days at&#13;
hospitals, and 7.3 days at the NRH. There was considerable variation between hospitals, where&#13;
the average LOS ranged from 3.6 days at Good Samaritan Hospital (GSH) and Tulagi to 10.8&#13;
days at Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi. As shown in Figure 51, there was also variation between the wards at the NRH,&#13;
with the average LOS ranging from 102 and 70 days in the rehabilitation and tuberculosis wards&#13;
respectively, to 2 and 5 days in the birthing and gynaecology wards respectively. For other&#13;
wards at the NRH, the average LOS varied from 8 to 17 days. As shown in Figure 73, the&#13;
average LOS at the NRH was higher than in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea (PNG), but&#13;
lower than New Zealand.&#13;
&#13;
The average BOR was 32% for hospitals and 80% for the NRH. 114 There was considerable&#13;
variation in the BOR between hospitals: from 18% at Lata to 56% at GSH. The BOR for the&#13;
second largest hospital, Gizo (24%), was below average. As shown in Figure 73, the average&#13;
BOR at the NRH was higher than for hospitals in Fiji (52%).&#13;
&#13;
As shown in Figure 74, there were 86 practicing doctors in Solomon Islands, including 13 at&#13;
hospitals and 73 at the NRH. This equates to 0.2 practising doctors per 1000 population. This&#13;
was slightly higher than for PNG, which had 0.1 practising doctors per 1000 population, but&#13;
lower than Fiji (0.6 practising doctors per 1000 population), New Zealand (2.8 practising doctors&#13;
per 1000 population) and Australia (3.3 practising doctors per 1000 population), as shown in&#13;
Figure 73.&#13;
&#13;
Solomon Islands also had a smaller ratio of nurses to the population compared to other countries&#13;
in the region, except for PNG. As shown in Figure 73, in Solomon Islands there were an&#13;
estimated 1.7 nurses per 1000 population in 2005, 115 which was higher than the estimated 0.4&#13;
nurses per 1000 population in PNG, but lower than Fiji, New Zealand and Australia (2.7, 10.1&#13;
and 10.2 practising nurses per 1000 population respectively). Solomon Islands health workforce&#13;
&#13;
114&#13;
    The NRH and the MHMS reported the bed occupancy rate as 91.4% for 2012. The discrepancy is likely due to&#13;
bed count.&#13;
115&#13;
    The total number of nurses was not calculated in this study. Thus it is not possible to update this figure based on&#13;
the study findings.&#13;

&#13;
population density (doctors/nurses/midwives per 1,000) is estimated at 2.17 compared with 0.5&#13;
for PNG, 2.61 for Fiji and 1.8 for Vanuatu.&#13;
&#13;
A recent costing study in Fiji also estimated the cost per inpatient and outpatient admission at&#13;
hospitals. 116 The cost of an inpatient admission and outpatient visit at a hospital in Fiji was USD&#13;
339 and USD 59 in 2012, compared to USD 559 and USD 13 in Solomon Islands in 2013.&#13;

Figure 75 shows the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) clinical staff per bed by facility type&#13;
and province. There was consistency across the various provinces for both hospitals and AHC,&#13;
with an average 0.7 beds per clinical FTE and a range from 0.4 to 0.8, for both facility types.&#13;
There was greater variation across RHC and NAP, which have few beds for inpatients. There&#13;
was also greater variation across the wards at the NRH, with a variation from 0.43 beds per&#13;
clinical FTE in the orthopaedic ward, to 1.1 beds per clinical FTE in the nursery.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 76 shows the number of outpatient visits per clinical FTE by province and facility type.&#13;
This ratio was calculated based on all clinical FTE working at a facility; given the small number&#13;
of inpatients at AHC, RHC and NAP staff could not be allocated to outpatient and inpatient&#13;
services. On average, AHC (2,305), RHC (1,735) and NAP (1,297) had higher outpatient visits&#13;
per clinical FTE than the NRH (125) and hospitals (497). AHC in HCC averaged the highest&#13;
outpatient visit per clinical FTE of any facility type (6,173) and Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi averaged the lowest&#13;

Inpatient admission per clinical FTE by province and facility type is shown in Figure 77. This&#13;
ratio was calculated based on all clinical FTE working at a facility; given the small number of&#13;
inpatients at AHC, RHC and NAP staff could not be allocated to outpatient and inpatient&#13;
services. On average AHC (31) had the highest inpatient admissions per clinical FTE than other&#13;
facilities, although hospitals (27) and the NRH (25) averaged higher than RHC (20) and NAP&#13;
(11). Church hospitals in Malaita (Atoifi) (48) and Guadalcanal (GSH) (41), as well as AHC in&#13;
Western (47) and Temotu (41) had higher ratios than other facilities. AHC and RHC in&#13;
Guadalcanal had a lower ratio than AHC and RHC in all other provinces, which may be due to&#13;
the fact that they have a lower number of inpatient admissions, as shown in Figure 45. NAP also&#13;
had a lower ratio than other facility types, which is also likely due to the low number of inpatient&#13;
admissions.&#13;

Figure 78 presents an analysis of the labour productivity of various wards and outpatient clinics&#13;
in the NRH. For inpatients it presents ratios of clinical staff per bed and per occupied bed; for&#13;
outpatient clinics it presents the daily number of contacts per clinical staff member. The medical&#13;
ward and nursery had the highest ratio of staff to beds, but the ratio for the nursery declines&#13;
when adjusting for occupied beds, as the bed occupancy in this ward was greater than one&#13;
(suggesting that other beds outside the ward are utilised). The number of outpatient contacts per&#13;
staff was highest in the ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinic and the emergency (general outpatients)&#13;
department, where they see on average 6 patients a day. Further investigation is required to fully&#13;
confirm these figures as the human resource information on staff location (ward, clinic) does not&#13;
always match the rostered numbers.&#13;

5.2 Efficiency analysis&#13;
&#13;
The relative efficiency of MHMS facilities was analysed using data envelopment analysis (DEA).&#13;
The DEA first identified facilities using the lowest level of inputs given their current level of&#13;
output. These relatively efficient facilities mapped out an â&#128;&#156;efficiency frontierâ&#128;&#157; reflecting â&#128;&#156;best&#13;
managerial practiceâ&#128;&#157; at different scales of production, among sampled MHMS facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Relatively efficient facilities operating on the frontier were then compared against other facilities&#13;
operating at a similar scale of production to calculate measures of technical efficiency (TE). This&#13;
comparison produced technical efficiency (TE) scores for facilities in the range 0 to 1. A TE&#13;
score of 1 indicates the facility is operating on the frontier at â&#128;&#156;best practiceâ&#128;&#157; and requires 100%&#13;
of its current level of inputs to produce its current level of output. Facilities producing the same&#13;
level of output as a best practice facility, but using higher levels of input are considered&#13;
(relatively) technically inefficient and receive a score of less than 1. For these facilities, the&#13;
difference between 1 and their TE score reflects the reduction in inputs that would be required to&#13;
reach the efficiency frontier and achieve best practice.&#13;
&#13;
Scale efficiency (SE) scores were then calculated by making a further comparison against the&#13;
facility or facilities with the lowest ratio of inputs to outputs, irrespective of scale. An SE score&#13;
of 1 suggests that the facility is operating at its efficient scale. This means that, after achieving&#13;
any gains in TE, it would not be possible to achieve a further reduction in the ratio of inputs to&#13;
outputs by increasing or decreasing output. For facilities with an SE of less than 1, the difference&#13;
between 1 and their SE score suggests that a strategic decision to vary the size of the facility&#13;
might allow the facility to make further reductions in the ratio of inputs to outputs.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 79 to Figure 81 present the average results, summarised by province and facility type, for&#13;
the DEA. This analysis is explained in the Technical Annex (Section 3.10) and presented in&#13;
detail in in Appendix A, Table 35. The models use measures of recurrent cost (e.g. expenditure&#13;
on salaries) and number of beds to capture differences in the amount of inputs that facilities use&#13;
to produce their observed levels of inpatient admissions and outpatient visits. The advantage of&#13;
using beds and recurrent costs rather than physical quantities (e.g. number of nurses employed),&#13;
to capture differences in the amount of inputs that facilities use to produce their observed level&#13;
of output, is that labour cost provides a more compact proxy for between-hospital differences in&#13;
skill-mix than would the inclusion of separate quantity measures for each labour category. 121&#13;
&#13;
Figure 79 shows the results for the main model for AHC, RHC and NAP. Figure 80 shows the&#13;
results for AHC, RHC and NAP for a more disaggregated model; with staffing costs and cost of&#13;
drug and other supplies split from other recurrent costs and included separately. Figure 81 shows&#13;
the results for the main model for hospitals and AHC. The data presented are the TE and SE&#13;
scores assuming variable returns to scale (VRS).&#13;
&#13;
121&#13;
   Note that the interpretation of the DEA results when using labour costs is in dollar terms rather than in terms of&#13;
input requirements. For example, if a facility has a TE=0.40, production costs would need to be reduced by 60% in&#13;
order to reach the frontier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        94&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                              Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The analysis found a large number of AHC, RHC and NAP are operating a very long way away&#13;
from the efficiency frontier, and relatively few (15 out of 85 facilities in the sample) are&#13;
operating on the efficiency frontier in the main model (Figure 79). The number of AHC, RHC&#13;
and NAP on the efficiency frontier is expected to be greater in the more disaggregated model&#13;
(Figure 80) and this holds true. The disaggregated model identified the same 15 facilities as&#13;
being on the efficiency frontier, with an additional 14 facilities also on the frontier, for a total of&#13;
29 out of 85 (34%).&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, the analysis found 8 out of 31 facilities (26%) in the hospitals and AHC analysis were&#13;
operating on the efficiency frontier (Figure 81).&#13;
&#13;
It is important to remember that a facility operating on the efficiency frontier may not&#13;
necessarily be operating at its efficient scale (rather it is doing as well as it can, given its current&#13;
scale). The analysis suggests that very few facilities are operating at their efficient scale. In the&#13;
main model, only 5 of the 85 facilities (6%) were found to be operating at their efficient scale&#13;
with respect to the production of inpatient and outpatient services. The majority of facilities are&#13;
found to be operating under increasing returns to scale. This suggests that, even after removing&#13;
all technical inefficiency, some facilities could further reduce their ratio of inputs to outputs by&#13;
making a strategic decision to increase the scale of the facility.&#13;
&#13;
A further analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of efficiency and inefficiency. 122&#13;
For the lower level facilities, the analysis considered the influence of province, facility type,&#13;
facility condition, facility size (number of rooms), management (government, co-managed by a&#13;
private company, or co-managed by a church or non-government organisation), reliance on&#13;
patient contributions, remoteness (travel time to collect drugs and access to second level medical&#13;
stores) and production of outreach services (outreach share of total recurrent cost and trips taken&#13;
from the facility for outreach). Results suggested that province, facility-type, facility size&#13;
(number of rooms) and participation in outreach activities may be important determinants of&#13;
TE. For hospitals and AHC, a limited set of facility characteristics were tested due to missing&#13;
data and the small sample size. Only province was significantly associated with TE scores with&#13;
facilities in Guadalcanal, and in some specifications Makira, significantly more efficient than&#13;
facilities in the reference province: Central.&#13;

6. Discussion&#13;
6.1 Limitations&#13;
&#13;
This study was the first of its kind in Solomon Islands and, as such, there were numerous lessons&#13;
learned along the way. The engagement by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS)&#13;
of eight trainee nurses as data collectors was a valuable contribution from the MHMS to the&#13;
study: the nurses were highly competent; developed into independent data collectors; and&#13;
appreciated the opportunity to undertake non-clinical work and gain research experience. The&#13;
use of mobile phones and laptops to administer the survey instruments was also a successful&#13;
strategy. On the other hand, some key pieces of information were not collected or available and&#13;
needed to be approximated. These limitations are discussed further below.&#13;
&#13;
a) Information that would have strengthened the analysis&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS collects a wealth of data at facilities, Provincial Health Offices (PHO) and&#13;
headquarters that were key to calculating the estimates presented in this report. The steps taken&#13;
by the MHMS (including the MHMS Human Resources, Finance and Health Information&#13;
System (HIS) teams, the National Referral Hospital (NRH) and the National Medical Stores&#13;
(NMS)), with the support of development partners, to further strengthen its information systems&#13;
should receive continued attention.&#13;
&#13;
The estimates presented in this report would have benefitted from the following (some of which&#13;
the MHMS is currently working towards):&#13;
    (i)   A consolidated list of active facilities used across the MHMS (e.g.: by HIS, NMS,&#13;
          and the PHO);&#13;
    (ii)  Estimates of population catchment per facility;&#13;
    (iii) A national database of all staff working at each facility;&#13;
    (iv)  An accurate record of the NMS supply chain (i.e.: the specific Second Level Medical&#13;
          Stores (SLMS) that the facility receives its NMS orders from); and&#13;
    (v)   Acquittal of the provincial health service grants by facility or facility type.&#13;
&#13;
The completeness of data in the HIS was also a limitation. Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi is the largest hospital and did&#13;
not systematically report to the HIS in 2012 or 2013, thus data were imputed. The NRH also did&#13;
not report to the HIS in 2012 or 2013. It had an electronic system for admissions, which was&#13;
used to estimate the total number of inpatients. There was no electronic system for outpatients at&#13;
the NRH, so the total number of outpatients was estimated from the registers and booking sheets.&#13;
&#13;
b) Limitations in cross sectional data collection&#13;
&#13;
The data were collected during a single visit to health facilities, except for the NRH. Where there&#13;
were limitations in the data collected during this visit, follow up queries were made via email,&#13;
phone and radio to provincial and church hospitals and Area Health Centres (AHC).&#13;
&#13;
                                                98&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                             Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were some limitations in relation to the transport and maintenance costs that could not be&#13;
addressed through follow up. Transport costs are mostly met by provincial health service grants&#13;
(and revenue collected through voluntary contributions). As information was not consistently&#13;
available for all provinces on the cost of transport by facility type, the transport costs were&#13;
estimated based on nurse recall of the number of trips that they have taken and the cost of those&#13;
trips. Estimates of maintenance costs were sought from nurses, but it was difficult to determine&#13;
whether these expenses should be considered recurrent or capital. The costs varied significantly&#13;
and were difficult to verify. Thus an approximation was used based on the average proportion of&#13;
provincial health service grants spent on maintenance across all provinces for which data were&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the sample only included a small proportion of Nurse Aid Posts (NAP). As&#13;
explained in the Technical Annex, the desired sample of 25% of NAP in five provinces was not&#13;
met given that some of the NAP in the sample reported to be Rural Health Clinics (RHC), and&#13;
there were more NAP in some provinces than originally thought. In total 18% of NAP were&#13;
included in the study sample (35 out of 190).&#13;
&#13;
c) Limitations in the calculation of service costs&#13;
&#13;
Data used to allocate the recurrent costs to inpatient and outpatient departments was also limited.&#13;
This was in part due to the original study data collection methods, and in part due to the&#13;
availability of information.&#13;
&#13;
The original study methods did not include the collection of samples from the registers in the&#13;
laboratory and imaging departments at hospitals to determine how many tests are performed for&#13;
inpatients and how many tests are performed for outpatients. Samples were obtained from a&#13;
number of hospitals after data collection was completed (from those registers that include such&#13;
information), and an average was used for hospitals that could not be revisited. Any variation in&#13;
the actual distribution of laboratory and imaging costs between inpatients and outpatients has&#13;
been assumed to be zero, as averages were used based on a subset of facilities.&#13;
&#13;
The original study methods proposed to allocate staff time between inpatient and outpatient&#13;
departments using rosters (of which photos were taken). These rosters only distinguished&#13;
between inpatient and outpatient departments at hospitals, not AHC, Rural Health Clinics (RHC)&#13;
and NAP, where many staff undertake both inpatient and outpatient duties during their working&#13;
day. The original study methods did not include questions on how staff allocate their time&#13;
between inpatient and outpatient departments at AHC, RHC and NAP. Follow up questionnaires&#13;
were conducted with nurses at 16 out of the 20 AHC in our sample, and the average was applied&#13;
to RHC and NAP. The use of averages and lack of actual data collected from RHC and NAP&#13;
means that the allocation of staff time to inpatient and outpatient work are subject to error. This&#13;
is likely to have introduced further error to the estimates of inpatient and outpatient unit costs. It&#13;
is unknown if this results in an over (or under) estimate of outpatient (inpatient) costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 99&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                             Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
Some data were not available. For example, most registers in the specialist outpatient clinics at&#13;
the NRH do not record diagnosis or treatment provided. In many facilities and for many types of&#13;
outpatient visit, only limited data were available on what medicines were dispensed to patients.&#13;
In some cases, the types of medicine that might have been given were inferred on the basis of the&#13;
visit type, and in other cases the cost of the medicines were taken as a simple average for all&#13;
visits. These assumptions serve to under-estimate the actual variation in costs of outpatient&#13;
treatment by different conditions.&#13;
&#13;
As with all studies of this type, some assumptions are unavoidable. For example, for outpatient&#13;
visits, it was assumed that the cost of staff time incurred does not vary between patients with&#13;
different conditions at the same facility, whilst in the inpatient setting, it is assumed that the cost&#13;
of staff time per bed day is the same for every patient, regardless of their diagnosis or age and&#13;
gender. These assumptions are reasonable in this type of study, but they have the impact of&#13;
reducing the variation in unit costs of treating different conditions at each facility.&#13;
&#13;
Another important limitation in the estimation of unit costs by disease stems from the need to&#13;
sample patient records. In most cases a 5% sample was taken, however, given the often diverse&#13;
range of patient conditions, this means that in some instances the cost analysis was driven by&#13;
very small numbers of patients having a particular condition (note however that those conditions&#13;
with a prevalence of &lt;1% were generally not included in the cost analysis). This can result in&#13;
large errors in the estimated unit costs of treating that disease or condition, especially if the&#13;
patients who happened to be sampled were by chance cheaper or more expensive than the&#13;
average patient. This is likely to be most problematic for conditions like diabetes and&#13;
hypertension at lower level facilities, where there are very few presentations or admissions, and&#13;
conditions like the common cold and influenza at hospitals and the NRH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
6.2 Key considerations&#13;
&#13;
Over 80 officials from the MHMS headquarters, PHO, the NRH and development partners&#13;
attended a two-day workshop from 28-29 October to discuss the findings of the study. As&#13;
reiterated by the Acting Permanent Secretary, Dr. Tenneth Dalipanda, and other participants at&#13;
the workshop, the study provides a baseline for further analysis and action. It has produced a&#13;
wealth of information that the MHMS could use to inform its decisions on how resources could&#13;
be allocated so that the health system is managed more efficiently and equitably. This includes&#13;
through:&#13;
â&#128;¢ The annual operating planning and budget process (and how resources might be reallocated&#13;
    using a mixture of fixed costs and other components to increase the performance orientation&#13;
    within MHMS);&#13;
â&#128;¢ The setting of priorities as part of the next National Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 and the&#13;
    accompanying medium term expenditure pressures framework; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ The further refinement and implementation of the UHC/RDP and related service delivery&#13;
    packages (at early stages of development).&#13;
&#13;
In addition the study has highlighted the need for further policy action and analysis in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
&#13;
a) Efficiency&#13;
&#13;
The results of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) suggest that some facilities are operating&#13;
much more efficiently than others, that is, using their inputs more efficiently to produce output&#13;
(services). The DEA is a relative measure of efficiency, so will necessarily rank some facilities&#13;
as more efficient than others. However, there was considerable variation in the extent to which&#13;
facilities were operating efficiently, with many facilities operating far less efficiently than others&#13;
according to the DEA results. In order to better understand this variation, the MHMS and&#13;
partners could undertake further analysis of what facilities are doing well compared to other&#13;
facilities.&#13;
&#13;
There is also significant variation in recurrent costs within and between provinces, which would&#13;
benefit from further analysis to better understand these differences.&#13;
&#13;
The report does point to some variations in the cost of key inputs, such as food and energy costs&#13;
at hospitals, where potential savings could be made.&#13;
&#13;
b) Equity and access&#13;
&#13;
The results of the patient exit survey suggest that Solomon Islandsâ&#128;&#153; health system primarily&#13;
serves the lower middle income groups, that is, the second and third poorest income quintiles.&#13;
This is a significant achievement for any health system, especially one in a low resource setting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 101&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                           Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
The results of the patient exit survey also indicated that those in the poorest quintile were&#13;
underrepresented at facilities. However, it may be that those in the poorest quintile are more&#13;
likely to live in areas that were not part of the study sample, which led to their&#13;
underrepresentation in the national estimates. Thus further analysis is required to determine if&#13;
those in the poorest quintile have greater barriers to accessing health services, which may be due&#13;
to their lack of geographical access to a facility or their ability to make a financial contribution&#13;
to the facility. This analysis will be completed once the full results of the 2012/13 Household&#13;
Income Expenditure Survey are available (which were not available at the time the costing study&#13;
analysis was undertaken). Additional analysis could also be undertaken using the results of the&#13;
most recent census, mapping populations against facilities to better understand barriers to&#13;
geographical access.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, those in the richest quintile were far more likely to be receiving specialised care from&#13;
the NRH. This may be due to the fact that those in the richest quintile are more likely to reside in&#13;
Honiara.&#13;
&#13;
c) Service delivery&#13;
&#13;
Facilities are responsible for providing a range of services both within the facility and in the&#13;
community. The number of services provided varied by facility type and province. Better&#13;
understanding why service delivery varies in this way requires estimates of population&#13;
catchment per facility, which were not available for all facilities. This gap could be filled&#13;
through analysis of the census and other related data. This will help the MHMS better&#13;
understand if facilities with lower levels of service provision are underutilised or are serving&#13;
small remote populations.&#13;
&#13;
Another reason for the reported variation may be definitional. The MHMS, with support from&#13;
development partners, is in the process of incentivising the delivery of outreach services. Key to&#13;
measuring changes in performance is greater clarity on the definition of outreach. Outreach was&#13;
defined in this study in accordance with the national HIS and includes the number of patient&#13;
contacts on tour for antenatal care, postnatal care and child welfare. Doctors, nurse managers&#13;
and staff from public health programs also use the term outreach when they visit lower level&#13;
facilities to provide clinical services and/or conduct supervision. To provide greater clarity, the&#13;
MHMS could develop clear definitions of outreach in communities, outreach in facilities (which&#13;
may be referred to as clinical tours), and supervision conducted by area managers and national&#13;
program staff. Tours and associated contacts should also be reported separately.&#13;
&#13;
d) Patient presentations&#13;
&#13;
Maternal and child health services, followed by infectious diseases, are the main reason for&#13;
patient presentations at facilities. At the NRH, presentations for all labour and deliveries,&#13;
diseases in the perinatal period, maternal care related possible delivery problems and pregnancy&#13;
with abortive outcome, together account for 58% of all inpatient presentations at the NRH, 36%&#13;
at hospitals and 31% at lower level facilities. Thus, considering the proportion of unintended&#13;

&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                      Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
and unwanted pregnancies (57% and 25% respectively), significant investment in family&#13;
planning could reduce the number and severity of these presentations. 123&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, continued investment in prevention of infectious diseases, including in hygiene, water&#13;
and sanitation systems, will help reduce the number of inpatient and outpatient presentations&#13;
resulting from skin and diarrhoea.&#13;
&#13;
As this was a cross sectional data collection, the study did not produce evidence of an increase in&#13;
presentations due to non-communicable diseases (NCD). 124 While the study did show that the&#13;
proportion of inpatients with diabetes or hypertension was a small proportion of the total number&#13;
of admissions, the average cost per admission was relatively high compared to other conditions.&#13;
Again, investment in prevention and early treatment now is likely to lead to savings in the future.&#13;
&#13;
e) Patient contributions&#13;
&#13;
Both the patient exit survey and the health facility survey found that the collection of small&#13;
patient contributions for services and medical record books was widespread, including at&#13;
hospitals, which is permitted by existing legislation, and at AHC, RHC and NAP, which is&#13;
contrary to existing legislation. There was no evidence that contributions were being placed into&#13;
consolidated fund at hospitals, as required by the current legislation.&#13;
&#13;
The results of the patient exit survey suggest that the contributions were inequitable in the sense&#13;
that the poor pay more often and pay more, however further analysis is required to determine if&#13;
this finding was related to the possibility that the poor are more likely to live in remote areas,&#13;
where it may be more common to make a contribution to the facility. A small number of&#13;
respondents reported that contributions had previously dissuaded them from visiting a facility&#13;
(8%), however the sample may exclude those who were dissuaded from doing so on the day of&#13;
the study.&#13;
&#13;
The collection of contributions at AHC, RHC and NAP represents a small proportion of the costs&#13;
of running a facility and thus should be within the fiscal means of the MHMS to resolve by&#13;
providing substitute funding directly from the budget (and may be cheaper than attempting to&#13;
administer a formal user fee system). However the collection of contributions provides the only&#13;
steady stream of cash available to remote facilities that lack access to financial services. Thus, if&#13;
the MHMS seeks to stop the collection of contributions, it will need to ensure that medical&#13;
record books are freely available to facilities and that the PHO deliver supplies (fuel, soap,&#13;
phone credit) to facilities on a regular basis, for example with regular supervision visits.&#13;

   This will be examined in the 2015 STEPS, which will include the collection of blood samples to determine the&#13;

&#13;
Further research on fee collection at the NRH is needed to better understand the collection of&#13;
these contributions. None of the respondents to the patient exit survey reported that they made a&#13;
contribution at the NRH, although anecdotal evidence suggests that payments are made to secure&#13;
better, faster service at the NRH.&#13;
&#13;
f) Role of the NRH&#13;
&#13;
Between 56% and 82% of inpatient admissions at the NRH are self-referrals. It was not possible&#13;
to estimate where the self-referrals were from in our data. The village, island and province of&#13;
each patient was recorded in the inpatient sample, but proved inconclusive. Honiara City&#13;
Council was not recorded as a province for any patient, even for those patients who were&#13;
referred from clinics in Honiara. This is consistent with convention for those who live in Honiara&#13;
â&#128;&#147; they continue to refer to their ancestral village and/or province as their place where they are&#13;
from (even though they may have lived in Honiara all their life).&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS or NRH staff could conduct a small study on inpatients on where they have resided&#13;
over the past month and why they did not seek a formal referral to help inform their&#13;
understanding of who is accessing their services as self-referrals. This will help inform any&#13;
policy actions that aim to encourage patients to use formal referral pathways, plus provide better&#13;
evidence to assess whether the allocation of budgetary resources to NRH is appropriate given its&#13;
patient demand.&#13;
&#13;
g) Information systems&#13;
&#13;
As discussed in Section 6.1, the MHMS has made considerable progress on improving its&#13;
information systems for human resource, financing and health statistics. Further progress could&#13;
be made as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   (i)     A consolidated list of active facilities used across the MHMS (e.g.: by HIS, NMS,&#13;
           and the PHO);&#13;
   (ii)    Estimates of population catchment per facility;&#13;
   (iii)   A national database of all staff working at each facility;&#13;
   (iv)    An accurate record of the NMS supply chain (i.e.: the specific SLMS that the facility&#13;
           receives its NMS orders from); and&#13;
   (v)     Acquittal of the provincial health service grants by facility or facility type.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the MHMS should encourage all facilities, including Kiluâ&#128;&#153;ufi hospital, to&#13;
consistently report to the HIS. Using performance measures that are judged by HIS data, is a&#13;
way to indirectly incentivise reporting to the HIS. Specific attention should continue to be given&#13;
by the MHMS and development partners to the development of a HIS for inpatients and&#13;
outpatients at the NRH, and regular reporting to the MHMS.&#13;
&#13;
Progress could also be made within hospitals: for example, a simple Microsoft Excel tool could&#13;
be developed by the pharmacy department at the NRH to record the supplies provided to the&#13;
&#13;
                                               104&#13;
&amp;#12;Solomon Islands Health Facility Costing Study                                  Final Report, August 2015&#13;
&#13;
various wards. Similarly the laboratory department at the NRH could use a tool to record the&#13;
tests performed by the different teams within the laboratory to consolidate and make consistent&#13;
the information that is currently available in the various paper registers. 125&#13;
&#13;
Consideration may also be given to the list of conditions that are recorded on the HIS in the&#13;
patient registers and the monthly reporting form. Given that ARI is the dominant cause of&#13;
presentations at AHC, RHC and NAP, and the second highest at provincial and church hospitals,&#13;
consideration should also be given to distinguishing between ARI with and without pneumonia&#13;
or suspected pneumonia in the outpatient registers. 126&#13;
&#13;
h) Costing study data set&#13;
&#13;
The data that were analysed for the purpose of this report represents a small portion of the data&#13;
that were collected. Additional data were also gathered on the infrastructure and equipment&#13;
available at facilities in accordance with the standards set out in the UHC/RDP (as it stood in&#13;
August 2013 when data collection commenced). These data could be used to use to examine the&#13;
quality of facilities or the cost of meeting the infrastructure and equipment standards set out in&#13;
the UHC/RDP.&#13;
&#13;
There is also opportunity to further exploit the data that have been analysed for this report. For&#13;
example, with respect to the inpatient and outpatient samples, additional analysis could be&#13;
undertaken of various aspects of quality of care, such as the appropriateness of diagnosis and&#13;
prescription.&#13;
&#13;
The MHMS and development partners should consider incentivising research by MHMS staff&#13;
using the study data, for example: by establishing a small fund to support research assistants, or&#13;
providing sabbatical time for undertaking analysis and writing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
125&#13;
    These include registers for: Dengue, Chemistry, Overseas tests, Micro: midstream, Micro: aspirates, mouth,&#13;
throat and sputum, Micro: pus and wound swab, Micro: blood culture, Micro: stool, Micro: genital, Serology,&#13;
Serology â&#128;&#147; antenatal care, and Tuberculosis.&#13;
126&#13;
    The outpatient register uses two categories for ARI: ARI mild, ARI moderate/severe. The HIS monthly report&#13;
form adds the presence or absence of pneumonia to these categories as follows: â&#128;&#156;ARI mild (no pneumonia)â&#128;&#157; and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;ARI moderate/severe (pneumonia).â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
7. Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
This report adds to the body of information that is available for more evidence-based policy&#13;
making and priority setting. Like all such surveys, there are methodological limitations in the&#13;
approach taken; nevertheless, it prompts questions that help get to the heart of equitable and&#13;
efficient health service performance for all managers to consider.&#13;
&#13;
This is the first study of its kind in Solomon Islands and it has produced a wealth of information&#13;
that the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) could use to inform its decisions on&#13;
how resources are allocated and used so that the health system is managed more efficiently and&#13;
equitably. This includes through:&#13;
â&#128;¢ The annual operational planning and budget process (and how resources might be reallocated&#13;
    using a mixture of fixed costs and other components to increase the performance orientation&#13;
    within MHMS);&#13;
â&#128;¢ The setting of priorities as part of the next National Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 and the&#13;
    accompanying medium term expenditure pressures framework; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ The further refinement and implementation of the Universal Health Coverage/Role&#13;
    Delineation Policy and related service delivery packages.&#13;
&#13;
The full costing study data set contains a much wider set of information for further analysis and&#13;
use (as note in Section 6.3 above). The MHMS and World Bank will have the cleaned data set&#13;
in Stata format (including definitions) and copies of all survey instruments available from early&#13;
2015. Public use data files in electronic format of the data (including definitions) will also be&#13;
available from early 2015.&#13;

            Solomon Islands - Health facilities costing study
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Solomon Islands’ Ministry of Health
            and Medical Services (MHMS) commissioned this Health
            Facilities Costing Study (‘the study’) to better understand
            how resources are used to deliver health services. The MHMS
            oversees two main sources of recurrent funds in support of
            this system: annual appropriations from domestic government
            resources and budget support from its development partners,
            including via the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP). The
            MHMS recorded recurrent expenditures of SBD 403 million in
            2013, including SBD 262 million from domestic resources and
            SBD 141 million from HSSP, which amounted to 17 percent of
            total government recurrent expenditure. The MHMS uses these
            funds to support facilities at all levels of the health
            system, the National Referral Hospital (NRH; unless NRH is
            specifically mentioned it is not included as part of general
            reference to ‚hospitals‘), provincial and church hospitals
            (referred to as hospitals in this report unless otherwise
            specified), Area Health Centres (AHC), Rural Health Clinics
            (RHC) and Nurse Aid Posts (NAP), and national programs. This
            study focuses on the facilities only. Although the MHMS
            manages an estimated 96 percent of total health expenditure,
            little is known about how resources are used by these
            facilities. The study was designed to estimate the recurrent
            costs (staffing, medical supplies, transport, utilities and
            maintenance) currently incurred by health facilities, taking
            into account funds from the MHMS, as well as from churches,
            private organisations and patients.
