            FDI trends - looking beyond the current
            gloom in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The fall in foreign direct investment
            (FDI) since 1999 and China's growing share, worry most
            developing countries. But an in-depth look reveals new and
            promising trends. The decline is largely a one-time
            adjustment following the privatization boom of the 1990s.
            FDI is coming from more countries - and going to more
            sectors. The conditions for attracting FDI vary by sector:
            in labor-intensive manufacturing, for example, efficient
            customs, and flexible labor markets are key, while in

            matter most. Sorting out the microeconomic issues by sector
            will be good, not only for FDI, but also for domestic investors.
