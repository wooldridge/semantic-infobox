            WPEP is an action research project in the Philippines, which is jointly funded by AusAID (the Australian&#13;
       Government's aid program), the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank and the Government of&#13;
       the Philippines (GOP). The executing agency for the GOP is the Water Supply and Sanitation Program&#13;
       Management Office of the Department of Interior and Local Government (WSSPMO-DILG), with support&#13;
       from the Water and Sanitation Program ­ East Asia and the Pacific (WSP-EAP). The goal of the project is "to&#13;
       enhance the access of the under-served rural and urban poor to adequate water and sanitation services on&#13;
       a sustainable basis."&#13;
&#13;
            The WPEP action research agenda is demand driven through consultation with a broad range of water&#13;
       supply and sanitation sector practitioners in the Philippines. In Phase I, WPEP funded six background studies,&#13;
       which provided the basis for the learning agenda. Following consultation on these studies, WPEP Phase II&#13;
       commissioned local consultants to undertake four field-based studies on the following topics:&#13;
&#13;
           ·      Small Towns Water and Supply Management Models (STWSMM);&#13;
           ·      Urban Sewerage and Sanitation (USS);&#13;

Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Philippines consists of a chain of over  capita incomes lag behind those of its neighbors&#13;
7,000 islands, dominated by the three island    (see comparative regional data on page 5).&#13;
groups of Luzon (in the north), Visayas (in the&#13;
center), and Mindanao (in the south). The           Development potential in the Philippines rests&#13;

population density more than double the         well-educated workforce, with major economic&#13;

in urban areas, but urban growth has not been   low productivity and intensified global&#13;
matched by economic development, and per        competition. The Asian financial crisis, triggered&#13;
                                                in mid-1997, hindered the Philippine economy,&#13;
                                                leading to a loss of foreign exchange reserves,&#13;
                                                a higher debt burden and falling share prices.&#13;
                                                There have since been signs of recovery, with&#13;
                                                GDP growth increasing from 0.1% in 1998 to&#13;
                                                3.0% in 2000, but the Philippine Peso continues&#13;

                                                heightened by serious political and security&#13;
                                                problems. Charges of corruption and&#13;
                                                inefficiency have affected many agencies,&#13;
                                                delaying projects and discouraging investment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   The service area of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was divided&#13;
into East and West Zones, and two separate concession contracts were let. The contracts required&#13;
the concessionaires to carry out the following sewerage and sanitation activities:&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Manila Water Company (East Zone Concessionaire) to expand coverage of Central&#13;
         Sewerage System and implement sanitation programs in densely populated urban areas&#13;
         (including septage collection, barge loading station, septage treatment plant, rehabilitation&#13;
         of sewage pumping station and sewage treatment plant)&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Maynilad Water Services (West Zone Concessionaire) to rehabilitate and upgrade existing&#13;
         sewerage systems, expand sewer network and improve management of sewerage services&#13;
         (including construction of two sewage treatment plants, evaluation of alternative methods&#13;
         of sludge disposal)&#13;

             connected to the MWSS water system&#13;
&#13;
   Sewerage charges were planned to increase from 50% to 150% of household water bill, and&#13;
the 10% environmental fee (charged to MWSS customers without sewer connections) was to be&#13;
replaced by a sanitation charge equal to 75% of the water bill. However, as of early 2003, these&#13;
increases have not taken place.&#13;

Therefore, in 1997, MWSS took the bold step&#13;

                                    Septic Tank Systems&#13;
&#13;
 Operation: a septic tank is a water-filled box designed to collect and partially treat toilet&#13;
 wastes (feces and urine). When the toilet is flushed, the wastes flow through a pipe into the&#13;
 top of the septic tank. Heavy solids, such as feces, settle to the bottom of the tank, while&#13;
 liquids pass through before overflowing into a disposal system. Over time, bacteria within&#13;
 the septic tank break down some of the organic matter, thus the larger the tank is, and the&#13;
 more chambers it has, the better the treatment provided. Nevertheless, however well the&#13;
 septic tank functions, both the solids within the tank and the liquid that overflows from it&#13;
 contain harmful pathogens, hence are a potential source of infection and disease. For this&#13;
 reason, the effluent liquid must always be safely disposed of, either by allowing it to soak&#13;
 into the ground (away from water sources), or by passing it into a sewer network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                SEPTIC TANK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Maintenance: settled solids gradually accumulate at the bottom of the septic tank. When this&#13;
 sludge, or septage, occupies two-thirds of the depth of the tank, it needs to be removed,&#13;
 otherwise there is a risk that excreta will pass directly through the tank and overflow into the&#13;
 disposal system. The sludge is smelly, wet and highly pathogenic, so should always be removed&#13;
 by mechanical means (e.g. using a vacuum tanker) before being taken to an approved&#13;
 sludge treatment and disposal site.&#13;
&#13;
 Practice: two types of septic tanks are found in the Philippines: private septic tanks, which&#13;
 collect wastes from individual household toilets; and communal septic tanks, which collect&#13;
 wastes from a number of household toilets, generally through a small sewer network. Private&#13;
 septic tanks are the most common - usually small, single chamber tanks, which provide&#13;
 minimal treatment and limited sludge storage. Very few of these private septic tanks are&#13;
 regularly desludged, which reduces the level of treatment provided, and heightens the risk&#13;
 of untreated sewage and effluent finding its way into the local environment. According to the&#13;
 1975 `Code on Sanitation of the Philippines', all private septic tanks should pipe their effluent&#13;
 to a `sub-surface adsorption system' (or other treatment device), but this type of soakaway&#13;
 system requires additional space and investment, thus most urban households in the&#13;
 Philippines prefer to pipe their septic tank effluent directly to a nearby drain, canal or&#13;
 watercourse.&#13;

    It is clear that the case study systems have                 network. Since then, the city government has&#13;
had little impact on access to sanitation. They                  funded further improvements and rehabilitation,&#13;
cover only a fraction of their host cities and serve             and overseen a 30% increase in the number of&#13;

with most operating at or beyond their capacity                  public sanitation services are readily available,&#13;
for some time. The Baguio City sewerage system                   a significant proportion of the community has&#13;

                      Tariff Collection Arrangements, Baguio City&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In Baguio City, the Public Utilities &amp; Safety Office (PUSO) manages the technical aspects of&#13;
the sewerage system. Billing and collection are carried out by the City Treasurer's Office, while&#13;
the City Accounting Office handles disbursements and accounts. In 1995, Baguio City government&#13;
signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the Baguio City Water District, whereby the&#13;
Water District would add sewerage charges to the water bills of those with sewer connections,&#13;
and return this sewerage revenue to the city government. The sewerage charges were to be set&#13;
at 60% of the water bill, and the water district was to receive a collection fee equal to 10% of the&#13;
sewerage revenues to recompense for its administrative costs. Unfortunately, immediately prior&#13;
to implementation, the Water District decided that their collection fee was inadequate, and&#13;
called off the agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Unable to charge based on actual water consumption, the LGU uses a flat rate sewerage&#13;
tariff (based on average water consumption in four categories). However, there is no effective&#13;
sanction for non-payment of sewerage fees, and less than 25% of costs were recovered in&#13;
2001. The City Treasurer's Office recently declared that commercial customers would not receive&#13;
their business permit until they paid their annual sewerage fees, but this appears to have had&#13;
little impact on revenues to date.&#13;

1. Financing urban sanitation                          City case illustrates, the water service provider&#13;
      improvements                                     is not always willing (or able) to collect sanitation&#13;
                                                       charges. Furthermore, whilst there are strong&#13;
    The central problem is that urban sanitation       synergies in financial management, sanitation&#13;
improvements are expensive, and the market for         services require different skills and resources to&#13;
these services is small. Most septic tank users        those needed for water supply, and thus benefit&#13;
are non-poor urban households, who pay no              from being managed by an autonomous unit.&#13;
sanitation charges. As a result, sanitation service&#13;
providers have lost their main revenue base.               The fact that LGUs have the final&#13;
                                                       responsibility for urban sanitation services, and&#13;
    Densely populated urban housing rarely has         the importance of local political support,&#13;
the space or ground conditions necessary for the       recommends that LGUs retain overall control of&#13;
septic drainage fields required by law. However,       their local services. However, this does not mean&#13;
it is unrealistic to expect thousands of urban         that LGUs have to be service providers. LGUs&#13;
households to stop using their private septic tanks    need to establish sanitation units to monitor and&#13;
simply because others believe that the effluent is     regulate (at the city level), while contracting out&#13;
harmful. This sea change will require substantive      as many sanitation services as possible,&#13;
evidence of the environmental health risks             including: billing and collection of sewerage and&#13;
associated with current septic tank systems, to        sanitation charges; desludging and sludge&#13;
pave the way for enforceable sanctions against         treatment services; and, effluent testing. The&#13;
the discharge of inadequately treated effluent.        benefits of linking water and sanitation charges&#13;
Until awareness of the environmental health risks      also suggest that LGUs should encourage and&#13;
increases dramatically, it will be very difficult to   assist water service providers to establish&#13;
persuade either the Philippine public, or its          sanitation units (or link with other sanitation&#13;
political representatives, that more investment in     service providers) wherever possible.&#13;

    A more practical solution is to begin charging          urban poor&#13;
septic tank users for their discharges (based on&#13;
the `polluter pays' principle), and then use this          The majority of the urban population has&#13;
revenue to develop sludge and effluent collection,     access to adequate sanitation services, even if&#13;
and treatment facilities. Political approval and       these services currently lack appropriate&#13;
effective administration of such an environmental      treatment or disposal. However, most of the&#13;
tax will be difficult but, if successful, would create urban poor living in slum and squatter housing&#13;

services. In Manila, households without sewer          sanitation services. The urban poor bear the&#13;
connections already have a 10% environmental           brunt of the environmental and health costs&#13;
tax added to their water bills, which is helping to    caused by inadequate sanitation and,&#13;
fund the development of free septic tank               therefore, the top priority for the urban&#13;

            Urban sanitation is one of the most
            serious challenges facing the Government of the Philippines.
            As a result of rising urbanization over the last twenty
            years, more than half the population now live in densely
            populated cities and towns. By some estimates, about 80
            percent of these urban households have access to adequate
            sanitation, such as toilets, but the vast majority of them
            are reliant on private sanitation facilities. Less than 8
            percent of the households in Metro Manila have sewer
            connections, and coverage is lower still in the rest of the
            country. Only three of the 1,500 cities and towns in the
            Philippines contain functioning public sewerage systems, and
            these are now old, undersized, and in need of major
            rehabilitation. A few communal toilets have been constructed
            in low-income urban areas, but there is little evidence of
            any other public sanitation services. Faced with this void,
            urban residents have provided their own sanitation
            facilities. Many households now own a private toilet and an
            individual septic tank, while more expensive housing
            developments often include private sewerage systems and
            communal septic tanks. Unfortunately, there has been little
            control or regulation of these private facilities, and many
            are badly designed and constructed. All too often, poorly
            maintained septic tanks discharge inadequately treated
            sewage and effluent directly into stormwater drains,
            waterways and streets, with serious consequences for both
            water quality and public health.
