Abstract&#13;
This study compares China's government finance sector with that of&#13;
other low-income countries and draws lessons from the structural differences&#13;
between the public sectors of low- and middle-income countries. In light of&#13;
China's objective to move to a midd:Le-income status by the end of the century,&#13;
and its recent progress in implementing economic reforms, such a study appears&#13;
very timely.&#13;

1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01      China's long-term development plan envisions that, by the year 2000,&#13;
the gross value of its industrial and agricultural output will be four times&#13;
that of 1980, which will permit its population to have achieved a "relatively&#13;
comfortable standard of living, rnaybe a per capita income of about $800."&#13;
This means that by today's standards, China will move from a low-income&#13;
country to a middle-income country. Such a change may have substantial impli-&#13;
cations for the structure of its economy, and the experience of other&#13;
countries that went through such a change may be instructive.&#13;
1.02      This paper compares China's government finance sector with that of&#13;
other low-income countries and draws lessons from the structural differences&#13;
between the public sectors of low- and middle-income countries. Cross-section&#13;
data and time-series analyses are used. Cross-section data have the advantage&#13;
of being more readily available and of referring to a given time period during&#13;
which the countries are subject to the same general set of contemporary influ-&#13;
ences broadly defined. The effect of some economic, demographic and other&#13;
relevant variables on public sector developments can be isolated, but only at&#13;
a high level of generality. Timea-series data are also used. They can shed&#13;
light on budgetary developments during the process of growth and development,&#13;
yet they cannot hold constant the effects of changes in social, ideological&#13;
and political forces conditioning the developments of the government sector.&#13;
This paper was prepared by Luc DeB Wulf (Senior Economist in the Asian Depart-&#13;
ment of the International Monetary Fund). The views expressed are solely&#13;
those of the author. The contribution of Pedro Rado is gratefully&#13;
acknowledged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Hence, one should not expect that the impact of rising living standards on the&#13;
public sector, as isolated from a historical perspective, will always coincide&#13;
with that drawn from cross-section data. However, the paper starts with the&#13;
proposition that the structure of the public sector varies with the stage of&#13;
economic development as measured by the growth of per capita income.&#13;
1.03      This study of international experience of budgetary developments and&#13;
the lessons it may have for China comes at an appropriate time. China's&#13;
government finance has recently been subjected to a number of major changes,&#13;
in part reflecting deliberate budgetary policy measures, but largely because&#13;
the budget had to accommodate policy measures taken in other sectors of the&#13;
economy. Subsidies grew because increases in procurement prices were not&#13;
fully reflected in higher consumer prices; wage increases were absorbed by the&#13;
enterprise sector, which transferred lesser amounts of profits to the budgets,&#13;
and budgetary expenditure on investment fell sharply. As a result of these&#13;
changes, the overall size of the budget fell from about 35 percent of GDP in&#13;
1978 to about 30 percent in 1982, while its composition also changed.-/ Tax&#13;
revenue became more important (49 percent of total revenue in 1982 against&#13;
42 percent in 1978), while the share of profit transfer fell (from 56 percent&#13;
in 1978 to 48 percent in 1982.) On the expenditure side, consumer subsidies&#13;
gained in importance (20 percent of total expenditure in 1982 against&#13;
6 percent in 1978), at the expense of investment expenditure which was dras-&#13;
tically reduced for stabilization purposes as budgetary revenue had fallen.&#13;
(It fell from 43 percent in 1978 to 25 percent in 1982.) Because of this&#13;
1/   Shares refer to expenditure and revenue breakdown using the IMF&#13;
Government Finance Statistics definition (Appendix Table 1).&#13;

contraction of overall expenditure, the overall fiscal deficits were contained&#13;
and amounted to only 0.6 percent of CDP in 1982.&#13;
1.04      In part to correct these trends and in part on their own merit,&#13;
several tax and expenditure policy changes were recently introduced. Income&#13;
tax has replaced the system of profic retention and transfers of state-owned&#13;
enterprises; commodity tax was changed by the introduction of a value-added&#13;
tax by multiple rate changes, and several other taxes and levies were intro-&#13;
duced.21&#13;
1.05      The paper is organized as follows.  Chapter 2 sets the background of&#13;
the discussion by outlining various functions of the government sector.&#13;
Chapter 3 analyzes international trends in budgetary expenditure and compares&#13;
these with China's present situation, while Chapter 4 presents a similar&#13;
analysis for budgetary revenue. Chapter 5 presents some conclusions.&#13;
2. FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR&#13;
2.01      The functions of the public sector can perhaps best be analyzed when&#13;
grouped around the implementation of four major tasks: (a) resources must be&#13;
allocated in such a way that the needs of society--as perceived at any given&#13;
time and within the limits of resource availability--are efficiently catered&#13;
to; (b) incomes should be distributed in a way that is perceived as equitable;&#13;
(c) the economy should be made to operate at a high level of resource utiliza-&#13;
tion and with a stable value of money; and (d) economic growth and development&#13;
2/   In July 1983 the enterprise profit tax was introduced, and in&#13;
October 1984 several new taxes were introduced while other taxes were&#13;
changed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
should be stimulated.3/ These four functions can be called the Allocation,&#13;
Distribution, Stability, and Growth Functions. The relative importance of&#13;
these four functions, the constraints imposed by the economic environment, and&#13;
the social and political system chosen will greatly influence the size and&#13;
structure of the Government.&#13;
Allocation&#13;
2.02      The government supplies some goods and services, sufficient quanti-&#13;
ties of which, if any, would not be supplied otherwise. Pure public goods are&#13;
those which are consumed in equal amounts by all and, because no voluntary&#13;
payments can be expected, their financing is based on compulsory payments.&#13;
Defense and public administration are typical examples. Other goods could be&#13;
supplied by voluntary contributions, but the authorities may decide that their&#13;
consumption is so meritorious that the government should supply them, either&#13;
in full or in a supplementary fashion. Education and public health are typ-&#13;
ical examples. For simplicity's sake, goods catering to social and merito-&#13;
rious wants are often referred to as public goods.&#13;
2.03      Supply through the budget of public goods does not imply that they&#13;
must be produced by the public sector as private contractors could supply&#13;
roads, health and education services, and be paid for by the budget. State-&#13;
owned enterprises, state hospitals or even state schools are therefore not a&#13;
necessity. Yet most governments take a very active part in producing many&#13;
public goods and operate a large public sector which is not covered by the&#13;
budget.&#13;
3/   Richard A. Musgrave (1959).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.04      Public goods should be paid for by the beneficiaries only as another&#13;
set of policies is responsible for effecting the desired income distribution.&#13;
However, in the absence of an objective assessment of who benefits from public&#13;
goods, no such tax and fee structure is obvious.41&#13;
2.05      The allocation functiorn of the public sector set no limits or guide-&#13;
lines for the size of the public sector, as it only points out that public&#13;
goods are to be provided and, from the above, it is clear that even the&#13;
definition of public goods is not a purely technical matter. Values adhered&#13;
to by those in a position to influence budgetary decisions are often very&#13;
important. These values change over time and differ greatly across countries.&#13;
Redistribution&#13;
2.06      Income distribution in an economy depends on many factors, including&#13;
wage structure, market structure, wealth distribution, and availability of&#13;
educational opportunities. Often the income distribution that would prevail&#13;
in the absence of corrective action by the government sector is not the&#13;
desired one, and a tax-transfer system--in addition to administrative and&#13;
regulatory measures--is relied upon to make the desired correction. Monetary&#13;
transfers, preferential and subsidized supply of goods and services, a subsi-&#13;
dized social security system, and. deliberate biases in the budgetary expendi-&#13;
ture structure can all be used to provide a higher standard of living to some&#13;
4/   The main issue here is whether public benefits are enjoyed on an equal&#13;
per capita basis by all citizens or whether such benefits bear some&#13;
relation to the income of the beneficiaries. In the latter case, the&#13;
income elasticity of the demand for public goods would be the relevant&#13;
variable. As even the professional literature has not reached an&#13;
agreement on this issue, it does not appear reasonable to expect&#13;
politicians or administrators to come up with an agreed-upon tax and fee&#13;
schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
segments of the population. Progressive taxes are also used to keep income&#13;
differentials within acceptable boundaries. The scope for income redistribu-&#13;
tion through the budget depends on political preferences and on other instru-&#13;
ments in place that affect income distribution.&#13;
Stability&#13;
2.07      An uncontrolled economy tends to have drastic fluctuation in prices&#13;
and employment. Apart from relatively short-term swings, maladjustments of a&#13;
secular nature may arise towards unemployment and inflation. Public policy&#13;
must assume a stabilizing function in order to hold the departure from high&#13;
unemployment and price stability within tolerable limits. Tendencies towards&#13;
instability are greatly affected by the volatility of investments. In many&#13;
cases, enterprise investments are more volatile than government sector invest-&#13;
ment and, therefore, are often a source of instability. Hence, the emphasis&#13;
on stability in budget policy greatly varies among countries, as a result of&#13;
structural differences and their tolerance of unemployment and inflation.&#13;
Growth and Development&#13;
2.08      In the past, economic growth and development was the result of&#13;
private sector activity. However, this outcome was often seen as unsatis-&#13;
factory and the government has, in recent decades, taken greater initiative&#13;
through both regulatory and budgetary actions to promote growth and develop-&#13;
ment. The political system greatly influences the relative weight given to&#13;
these different channels, with socialist countries reserving a greater role&#13;
for the budget, both in the mobilization of resources and in the actual&#13;
investment process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.09      While clearly delineated in theory, budgetary actions needed to&#13;
implement allocation, income redistribution, stability, growth, and develop-&#13;
ment objectives are not clearLy distinguishable from each other, because&#13;
policy measures often have multiple effects. Nevertheless, these theoreticaL&#13;
distinctions may help in the analysis of the structure of China's government&#13;
finance within the context of public sector developments of other developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
3. EXPENDITURE DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
International Experience&#13;
3.01      Although public expenditure is constrained by the capacity countries&#13;
have to finance this expenditure, expenditure developments are analyzed first,&#13;
as they are at the center of the pub]Lic finance issue. Time-series data are&#13;
analyzed, followed by cross-section data, after which the factors that appear&#13;
to influence the development of the difference components of the total&#13;
expenditure are scrutinized.&#13;
Wagner's jIw of Expanding State Activrity in the Context of Time-Series&#13;
Analysis i&#13;
3.02      Adolph Wagner, a German economist of the nineteenth century, formu-&#13;
lated a "law" of increasing state activity and expenditure. Although there is&#13;
some doubt about how Wagner meant his law to apply, his generalization can&#13;
best be interpreted as predicting an increase in the ratio of government&#13;
expenditure to national income as per capita income rises in the course of&#13;
industrialization. He attributed this to growing administrative and protec-&#13;
51   See Richard Goode (1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
tive actions of the government in response to more complex legal and economic&#13;
relations, increased urbanization, and rising cultural and welfare expendi-&#13;
ture. He apparently considered the latter services luxuries, characterized by&#13;
income-elastic demand, that is, demand that rises faster than income. Wagner&#13;
also anticipated the growth of public enterprises, but agreed that this would&#13;
not necessarily involve increasing government expenditure.&#13;
3.03      There have been numerous attempts to test Wagner's law.  Although&#13;
findings differ, they generally confirm the tendency of the share of total&#13;
government expenditure in national income to rise. This tendency can be seen&#13;
in the following figures for the ratio of total government expenditures (of&#13;
all levels of government) to gross national product or gross domestic product&#13;
(in percentages) in five industrial countries in about 1890 and 1970.61&#13;
1890        1970&#13;
Canada                     9           32&#13;

United States              7           30&#13;
This rising trend has not always been a smooth one, and interruptions and&#13;
reversals have occurred.7-&#13;
6/   The figures for the two dates and five countries are not strictly&#13;
comparable because of differences in concepts and coverage.&#13;
7/   Wars have often led to an acceleration of this trend and to a permanent&#13;
upward displacement of the expenditure to CDP ratio. While temporary,&#13;
war expenditure has often Led to lessening of the tax resistance, thereby&#13;
accelerating the otherwise "normal" trend in rising expenditure to GDP&#13;
ratio. Alan T. Peacock and Jack Wiseman (1961), pp. 24 sq.; Richard A.&#13;
Musgrave (1969), pp. 87-90.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
3.04      Further statistical evidence is provided by the estimates of the&#13;
income elasticity of government expenditure in constant prices over the period&#13;
1950-77 for twelve industrial countries, including the five mentioned above&#13;
and Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and&#13;
Switzerland.8/ The elasticities (measured as the percentage increase in&#13;
government expenditure divided by the percentage increase in GDP) range from&#13;
1.4 for the United Kingdom to 2.7 for Sweden; the median value is 1.8.&#13;
3.05      Wagner's generalization, however, is not a genuine law in the sense&#13;
of offering a firm basis for predicting the behavior of individual countries.&#13;
Among industrial countries, large differences between countries and between&#13;
periods in the same country can be cbserved. It also is not clear to what&#13;
extent developing countries can be expected to follow the same course as&#13;
industrial countries. Wagner's law seems to have been intended to apply only&#13;
to industrial countries, but that does not rule out the possibility of a wider&#13;
application.&#13;
3.06      Few time-series studies have been made pertaining to developing&#13;
countries. Enweze, using data for the late 1950s and 1960s, found positive&#13;
income elasticities for total expenditure in thirteen out of fifteen countries&#13;
and positive elasticities for most of the principal functional categories in&#13;
the majority of the fifteen countries.9-&#13;
3.07      Using national income account statistics, it is possible to obtain&#13;
fairly long series on government consumption expenditure in a large number of&#13;
developing countries.  In the majority of these countries, government consump-&#13;

government consumption (both measured in constant prices) in 1960-70 and&#13;
1970-80 for 75 developing countries. Since estimates were not available for&#13;
all the countries for both periods, there are 134 pairs of observations in the&#13;
table. Among the 129 cases in which GDP was increasing, government consump-&#13;
tion was increasing more rapidly than GDP in 88 cases (68 percent of the&#13;
total); it was increasing at the same rate or less rapidly in 35 cases&#13;
(27 percent of the total); and it was decreasing in six cases. In the five&#13;
cases in which GDP was decreasing, government consumption was increasing in&#13;
three cases and decreasing more rapidly than GDP in two cases. Although the&#13;
statistics omit important parts of government expenditure--capital outlays,&#13;
transfer payments and subsidies, interest payments, and net lending--they shed&#13;
light on fiscal problems that many developing countries have experienced&#13;
during the 1960 and 1970s. It seems very likely that many developing&#13;
countries will continue to face demands that will cause government expenditure&#13;
to grow faster than national income.&#13;
3.08      One reason for this likelihood, which is implied in Wagner's law,&#13;
relates to an international demonstration effect that causes people in poor&#13;
countries to wish to emulate the consumption standard of rich countries.101&#13;
Political leaders of low- and middle-income countries today will not have the&#13;
same attitudes toward spending for education, health, and various economic and&#13;
social services that existed in the industrial countries when they were at a&#13;
comparable stage of development. Furthermore, citizens in the poor countries&#13;
are unwilling to accept standards that existed in the past.&#13;

3.09      The expenditure/GDP share in real terms is often claimed to increase&#13;
at a much smaller rate than in current terms.-'/ This is so, because&#13;
differential productivity growth between the public and the private sector,&#13;
combined with the fact that the public sector tends to maintain competitive&#13;
wage rates with the private sector, drives up unit labor costs in public&#13;
sector programs. This argument has been used to explain part of the rising&#13;
trend of government expenditure in industrialized countries.12/ Although&#13;
similar evidence is not available for developing countries, it would be&#13;
surprising if such a trend were not operative there too. However, even if the&#13;
extreme case were true and real public expenditure to GDP ratio remained&#13;
constant over time, it would only be of limited interest to budget officials&#13;
who must finance the current expenditure.&#13;
Cross-Section Data: General&#13;
3.10      The size of the government sector also seems to be systematically&#13;
related to per capita income when cross-section data from a large sample of&#13;
countries are analyzed. Based on data from 91 countries, total expenditure&#13;
for low-income countries (defined as countries whose per capita income is less&#13;
than $300) was found to be 21 percenl: of GDP, against 28 percent for middle-&#13;
income countries and 37 percent for industrial countries (Table 3.2). Hence,&#13;
per capita income seems to exercise an upward pressure on public expenditure.&#13;
11/ Morris Beck (1976), pp. 15-21 and Morris Beck (1979), pp. 313-356.&#13;
12/ Additional arguments are (a) the! tendency of the public sector to&#13;
purchase goods and services from elements of the private sector&#13;
experiencing relatively low productivity growth, (b) the increased&#13;
emphasis on the indexation of public transfers, (c) rigidities in the&#13;
public sector production functions that have limited the government's&#13;
ability to respond to shifts in relative input prices, and (d) the&#13;
inability of statisticians to measure gains in productivity correctly in&#13;
the public sector. Peter Heller (1981), pp. 61-74.&#13;

Despite the above-mentioned demonstration effect and the fact that at any&#13;
given time all countries are exposed to much the same value system concerning&#13;
the role and responsibilities of the public sector, poor countries have&#13;
smaller public sectors than middle-income and rich countries.  It is therefore&#13;
tempting to conclude that when a country moves up the income ladder, the&#13;
public sector tends to grow. This finding is obviously consistent with&#13;
Wagner's Law of Expanding State Activity, as illustrated in time-series data.&#13;

3.11      One explanation for this development is that the growth of govern-&#13;
ment spending is limited by the capacity to finance it; whether from domestic&#13;
resource mobilization, borrowing from the domestic banking sector or foreign&#13;
borrowing.  It is often asserted that this constraint is more binding in less&#13;
developed countries than in more developed ones, and that in the former, total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
spending is limited by fiscal capacity while in the latter, the size of the&#13;
public sector responds primarily to demands for services and transfer.&#13;
Although this assertion appears plausible and will be subjected to more&#13;
detailed analysis in the next chapter, it exaggerates the difference between&#13;
groups of countries. Both the demand for services and the supply of resources&#13;
affect government expenditure in all countries.&#13;
Cross-Section Data: Detailed Review of Developments in Selected Expenditure&#13;
Categories&#13;
3.12      Table 3.2 provides the average share of CDP for central government&#13;
expenditure classified by function, for three groups of countries: low-&#13;
income, middle-income, and industrial. Table 3.2 shows that, on average,&#13;
middle-income countries spend a larger share of their CDP on defense, educa-&#13;
tion, social security and welfare, and on the acquisition of capital assets&#13;
than do low-income countries. Industrial countries spend a still larger share&#13;
of their GDP on education, health and social security and welfare, but spend&#13;
less on defense, general public administration, and acquisition of capital&#13;
assets. Let it be emphasized that these observations are based on an&#13;
inspection of average shares spent by large numbers of countries, averages&#13;
which hide the often large dispersion of observations around the averages.&#13;
For instance, while industrial countries tend to spend a larger share of their&#13;
GDP on education, there are many exceptions and in several low-income&#13;
countries, that share is larger than in some industrial countries. (For&#13;
example, Burundi, Kenya, and Mali spend a larger share of their GDP on&#13;
education than do Austria, Denmark, and Iceland.) The averages given in Table&#13;
3.2 reveal only tendencies and hide many exceptions.&#13;
3.13      Data on the functional expenditure categories as shares of total&#13;
central government budgetary expenditure (Table 3.3) are based on the same&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

sample of countries. Of course, these statistics are nothing but the combina-&#13;
tion of the relative share of total expenditure in CDP and the share of expen-&#13;
diture categories in GDP. Yet, by presenting the data this way, the attention&#13;
is focused on the financing of various government expenditure categories.&#13;

No. 10, (Washington, DC) Table 11, pp. 30-31.&#13;
It shows, for instance, that although low-income countries spend only 4.3 per-&#13;
cent of their GDP on general public services, these expenditures absorb about&#13;
20 percent of their total budgetary resources. Middle-income countries, which&#13;
spend about the same share of their GDP on these expenditures, need only&#13;
15 percent of their budgetary resources for their financing. A similar&#13;
situation prevails for other expenditures where low-income countries spend&#13;
similar shares of GDP on particular functions, yet must devote a larger share&#13;
of their budgetary resources to it than middle-income countries. Low-income&#13;
countries seem to require a large share of budgetary resources for the provi-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
sion of basic public sector goods and services over which the authorities have&#13;
little or no discretion. After financing these basic general services (for&#13;
instance, basic levels of education and health expenditure), they seem to have&#13;
discretionary spending power over a much smaller share of the budget than&#13;
countries at a higher income leve!l. Only when total budgetary resources&#13;
increase, and this is positively related to income growth, can other expendi-&#13;
ture be accommodated.&#13;
3.14      A study of the effects of both income growth and other variables on&#13;
the subcomponents of budgetary expenditure was presented in two recent papers&#13;
prepared by Tait and Heller.l31 The authors tested for differences between&#13;
countries with high and low per capita income and, where discontinuities were&#13;
found, they reported the results separately for the groups. The results&#13;
obtained provide a framework for the comparison of functional and economic&#13;
expenditure patterns of countries having similar economic and demographic&#13;
positions; they do not, however, establish normative expenditure patterns.&#13;
3.15      The summary of the findings of the Tait-Heller study is given in&#13;
Table 3.4. One striking feature of these results is that per capita income is&#13;
not always the variable that contributes most to the explanation of differen-&#13;
ces in expenditure pattern between countries. Other major contributing&#13;
factors include demographic ones and the degree of urbanization. This&#13;
contrasts with the premise of many other cross-section studies of government&#13;
revenue and expenditure which use per capita income as a proxy for most other&#13;
underlying demographic, social, and economic differences. Furthermore, no&#13;
combination of variables could explain more than a small share of total&#13;

3.16      Only for the exp(enditure category of social security and welfare and&#13;
the category of health expenditure were the authors able to explain more than&#13;
half of the variance in the expenditure to CDP ratio among countries 14/ (as&#13;
reflected in an R2 of 0.82 and 0.62). For other expenditure categories, a&#13;
much smaller share of the variance was explained, despite the fact that some&#13;
variables showed a clearly significant relation.&#13;
3.17      General Public Services.  This includes financial administration,&#13;
external affairs, planning,, statistics, and other aspects of general adminis-&#13;
tration such as order, safety, and justice. Only 32 percent of the observed&#13;
variance was explained. The most significant explanatory variable was found&#13;
to be the share of total public expenditure in GDP.  Running a larger govern-&#13;
ment sector requires larger general public services expenditure. While this&#13;
is not a surprising result, it implies that there do not appear to be&#13;
economies of scale in running a government.&#13;
3.18      Increased urbanization tends to reduce the share of general public&#13;
services in GDP. This reflects the fact that catering to a geographically&#13;
concentrated population yields economies that are larger than those disecono-&#13;
mies required by such concentration (for instance, justice and order are often&#13;
said to be needed more in urban than rural areas). The share of population 14&#13;
years old and younger also exercises a positive influence on the share of&#13;
general public services in GDP. However, it is not at all clear why this is so.&#13;
3.19      Defense.  The defense expenditures are not well explained&#13;
(R2 = 0.15) by the variables used in the analysis, mainly because defense&#13;
14/ Such an explanation is consistent with the hypothesis that differences&#13;
among countries were caused by those factors but does not prove that was&#13;
so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
expenditure ratios varied widely among countries. Israel, Oman, Jordan,&#13;
Syria, and Iran had ratios to GDP of 10 percent or more in 1977, no doubt&#13;
influenced by recent war in the region. In contrast, the following countries&#13;
spent less than 1 percent of their GDP on defense: Bangladesh, Barbados,&#13;
Mauritius, the Bahamas, Fiji, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Madagascar,&#13;
El Salvador, Jamaica, and Nepal. Nevertheless, statistical significance was&#13;
obtained for the percentage of population aged 14 years old and under, and for&#13;
urbanization; it is again not clear why this is so.&#13;
3.20      Education.  Less than one third of the variation in this expenditure&#13;
was explained by the variables retained (R2 = 0.28). Per capita income proved&#13;
to be a highly significant determinant of the share in GDP of public expendi-&#13;
ture for education, mainly at incomes below $1,750. In these countries, a&#13;
great need for education exists; a need that in countries with higher per&#13;
capita incomes is partly fulfilled by the private sector. Also, when "basic"&#13;
educational needs are fulfilled, the public sector tends to spend its&#13;
resources elsewhere. For countries with incomes larger than $1,750, the ratio&#13;
of educational expenditure to GDP was strongly associated with the enrollment&#13;
ratio in secondary schools. The enrollment in primary schools was significant&#13;
for all countries. This tends to bear out the observation that expenditure on&#13;
education by government is believed to be important for basic primary educa-&#13;
tion in low-income countries, but that the attitude changes when per capita&#13;
income is over $1,750 and more importance is attached to secondary school&#13;
enrollment. Surprisingly, the percentage of population under the age of&#13;
fifteen was not a statistically significant influence on the ratio.&#13;
3.21      It is interesting to note that for countries in the sample, the&#13;
spread between actual expenditure on education and that predicted, using the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
relations between such expenditure and the variables found to be significant&#13;
in the study, was the smallest of all the functional categories studies. This&#13;
suggests a greater unanimity and concern among countries in relation to&#13;
government expenditure and education.&#13;
3.22      Health.  Over 60 percent of government expenditure on health was&#13;
explained by the proportion of population aged 65 and above and by the ratio&#13;
of population to hospital beds (R2 = 0.62). The age structure of the popula-&#13;
tion was found to be the most significant variable affecting health expendi-&#13;
ture. Countries with small shares of their total population in the 65 years-&#13;
and-above bracket probably focus on the diminution of epidemic diseases and on&#13;
preventive medicine, which is rather inexpensive, while the more expensive&#13;
curative medicine and caring for sick and dying people absorbs more resources&#13;
when the population ages.&#13;
3.23      The statistical relation between the population per hospital bed and&#13;
health expenditure becomes rather strong at levels of per capita income in&#13;
excess of $1,750 and probably reflects greater preoccupation with the quality&#13;
of medical care at higher incomes.&#13;
3.24      As in educational expenditure, the spread between actual health&#13;
expenditures and those predicted by the results of the Tait-Heller study was&#13;
relatively small.&#13;
3.25      Social Security and Welfare.  The Tait-Heller study was most&#13;
successful in explaining statistically the expenditure ratio for social secu-&#13;
rity and welfare. This category includes expenditures for social security;&#13;
old age, sickness, and disability payments; military and civil government&#13;
pensions; and other welfare expenditure. The per capita income of the&#13;
country, the percentage of population over the age of 65, and the share of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
labor force employed in industry were all positive and statistically signifi-&#13;
cant influences. No discontinuity between high-income and low-income&#13;
countries was discovered, which suggests that the low expenditure for this&#13;
function in most developing countries reflect mainly demographic and economic&#13;
factors rather than other social and political forces.&#13;
3.26      Instead of transfer payments for welfare purposes, many developing&#13;
countries provide subsidies for food and other articles of mass consumption&#13;
through below-cost pricing by public enterprises or through payments to&#13;
private enterprises. Many of these subsidies do not show up in the statistics&#13;
used by Tait and Heller because financial relations between public enterprises&#13;
and the central government are not reported in a way that would reveal them.&#13;
As such subsidies are more frequent in low-income and middle-income countries&#13;
than in industrialized ones, the high positive relation between per capita&#13;
income and social security and welfare expenditure may be somewhat&#13;
exaggerated.&#13;
3.27      Other Expenditure.  Expenditure for roads and other forms of&#13;
transportation and for communications were positively related to the rate of&#13;
growth of the urban population and negatively related to both the share of&#13;
manufacturing and the share of agriculture in GDP (R2 = 0.23). The expendi-&#13;
ture ratio for housing and community amenities was positively related to per&#13;
capita income in low-income countries but not in high-income countries&#13;
(R2 = 0.21).&#13;
3.28      Wages and Salaries.  Wage expenditures in the budget were largely&#13;
found to be determined by the functional expenditure breakdown. Hence,&#13;
countries that spend a large share of their GDP on education will also have&#13;
substantial wage payments, reflecting the fact that teacher salaries comprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
a large share of total expenditure on education This conclusion was also&#13;
confirmed by a later, more detailed study of government employment and pay&#13;
(Heller-Tait 1983). This study also found that government salaries in devel-&#13;
oping countries were about 4.4 times per capita income, but only 1.9 times per&#13;
capita income in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation&#13;
and Development (OECD). Yet, when compared with wages and salaries in the&#13;
nonagricultural private sector, government wages lag considerably. This&#13;
suggests that government sector employees in developing countries were not&#13;
able to translate their numerical weight (they constitute an average 44&#13;
percent of nonagricultural employment in these countries) into commensurate&#13;
strength in their wage rate relative to their peers in the modern component of&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
Economic System&#13;
3.29      Does the character of the economic system have predictable influ-&#13;
ences on government spending distinguishable from those of the economic, demo-&#13;
graphic, and other "objective" factors? This question appears to have been&#13;
little studied in regard to developing countries. A careful study by Pryor&#13;
(1968) compared public consumption expenditure (defined as government current&#13;
expenditure for goods and services and transfer payments) in seven market&#13;
economies and seven centrally planned economies, all of which are industrial&#13;
or semi-industrial countries. The author found that the nature of the&#13;
economic system played a statisticalLy significant role in accounting for&#13;
differences in public consumption expenditure for education but not in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
expenditures for defense, welfare, and health.15/ The recent study by Heller&#13;
and Tait covering a large number of countries found that neither the degree to&#13;
which an economic system is centrally planned nor the nature of the political&#13;
regime was a statistically significant influence on the size of general&#13;
government employment.16/ However, centrally planned economies tend to spend&#13;
a larger share of their GNP on capital expenditures than do other countries.&#13;
Aspects of International Experience Relevant for China&#13;
Functions of the Government Sector in China and its Impact on the Size and&#13;
Composition of Budgetary Expenditure&#13;
3.30      As of the early 1980s, China's state budgetary expenditure amounted&#13;
to about 32 percent of GDP, about the same share as in the 1957, if in both&#13;
periods the subsidy expenditure is included with other budgetary expenditure&#13;
(Table 3.5).IL'  This size of the budget is much higher than the average for&#13;
low-income countries (20.7 percent, see Table 3.2) and slightly higher than&#13;
the average for middle-income countries (27.9 percent). However, as there is&#13;
in each case a wide dispersion around the averages, these statistics indicate&#13;
only that China's budget expenditure is a relatively large share of its GDP,&#13;
not that China is an exception. As a matter of fact, the Gambia, with a per&#13;

as reductions in profit transfers from the enterprise sector to the&#13;

capita income of $208 in 1977, had expenditure equal to 35 percent of GDP in&#13;
1977, while 14 out of 50 countries included in the sample of middle-income&#13;
countries had expenditure/GDP ratios in excess of 32 percent. Although not an&#13;
exception on this score, China is unique in that it was able to finance nearly&#13;
all its expenditure without running a substantial deficit. In a sample of 62&#13;
low- and middle-income countries in 1980, budget deficits averaged 7 percent&#13;
of GDP.&#13;

3.31      Before engaging in a more detailed comparison of China's budgetary&#13;
expenditure with those of the international sample presented in the previous&#13;
section, it may be instructive to review briefly the major functions of&#13;
China's public sector, along the lines discussed in Chapter 2.&#13;
3.32      Allocation.  In China, as in all other countries, the government&#13;
sector supplies those goods that, due to their joint consumption and non-&#13;
excludability characteristic, are not supplied any other way. The range of&#13;
these goods is no broader in China than elsewhere. With respect to merit&#13;
goods (that is, these goods the government has determined so meritorious that&#13;
they should be consumed in larger amounts than would occur without government&#13;
involvement), China's option to operate along socialist principles and its&#13;
explicit commitment to the social welfare of its citizens may at first appear&#13;
to argue for a larger government sector. Furthermore, state-owned enterprises&#13;
are dominant in large segments of the economy and planning of production,&#13;
investment, and consumption is widespread. However, all this does not have to&#13;
result in a larger government budget, as some of this intervention is effected&#13;
through regulations which imply only little budgetary expense, and as the&#13;
operation of state-owned enterprises is neither unique to socialist countries&#13;
nor necessarily implies a budgetary burden.&#13;
3.33      Many nonsocialist countries operate a large sector of public enter-&#13;
prises (Table 3.6), and operate them at a substantial loss. For a sample of&#13;
public enterprises in developing countries, this loss was estimated at about&#13;
4 to 5 percent of CDP, half of which was reflected in budgetary accounts.&#13;
This compares with budget-financed deficits of state-owned enterprises in&#13;
China of about 1 percent of CDP in the early 1980s. As is the case in other&#13;
countries, some state-owned enterprises in China obtain substantial bank&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

financing to finance their deficit. Although less visible or open to&#13;
scrutiny, this phenomenon has received substantial attention in the Chinese&#13;
press.18/&#13;

3.34      State-owned enterprises in many countries appear to have a tendency&#13;
to operate at a loss or at low profitability levels and, instead of being&#13;
powerful instruments of resource mobilization, often become a financial burden&#13;
for the rest of the economy. This does not have to be so (IBRD, World&#13;
18/  It is often related in the accumulation of excessive and often unsalable&#13;
inventories by the commercial sector, which used to be obliged to&#13;
purchase all output of the induistrial sector. In this way, the indus-&#13;
trial sector often remained "profitable" and transferred a share of its&#13;
profits to the budget, while the commercial sector required bank credit&#13;
to finance its inventories. This has been termed "financing of covert&#13;
deficits" and contrasted with the relatively moderate bank financing of&#13;
the "overt" deficit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Development Report 1983, Chapter 8). Conflicting objectives, insufficient&#13;
operational autonomy, inadequate incentives linked to performance, and bureau-&#13;
cratic rather than commercial management style--all these have prompted&#13;
attempts at reform in many countries, of which China's ongoing reforms of the&#13;
enterprise system is one.&#13;
3.35      All in all, it does not appear that the role of China's budget as&#13;
allocator of resources requires a larger government budget than in other&#13;
countries at similar levels of development.&#13;
3.36      Redistribution.  A progressive tax structure can be used to improve&#13;
income distribution. However, taxes contribute to an improvement in the&#13;
income distribution only in a relative sense; they can make some people less&#13;
well off, but never make them better off. The latter is the role of expen-&#13;
diture policy.&#13;
3.37      In China, urban incomes are similar across regions, are largely&#13;
determined by the national wage structure, and are about twice as high as&#13;
rural incomes.-91 Until very recently, rural income differences within each&#13;
region and locality were limited by the method of remuneration through work&#13;
points in the communes but they varied greatly across regions as they depended&#13;
on local productivity. The introduction of the production responsibility&#13;
system and the greater latitude given to private economic activity may&#13;
increase income differences within both the urban and rural regions. At the&#13;
same time, faster growth of rural incomes in recent years has narrowed urban-&#13;
rural income differentials somewhat.&#13;
19/ In 1982, urban per capita income is estimated at Y 535 while rural&#13;
incomes amounted to Y 270. If subsidies were included, urban incomes&#13;
would be closer to Y 700 per capita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
3.38      In addition to price and wage policies and various regulations, the&#13;
present income redistribution policies are implemented mainly through a tax&#13;
and transfer system between the central government and local governments, and&#13;
through a set of subsidies to urban dwellers. The tax-transfer system redis-&#13;
tributes income regionally and thereby ensures a greater uniformity of&#13;
government services, while the subsidies are granted through both a national&#13;
system of subsidized prices for basic consumer goods and multiple price&#13;
subsidy schemes operated locally (such as transport, energy, housing). The&#13;
need for implementing income distribution policies by operating an expensive&#13;
subsidy scheme results from rigid wage and price structures which have not&#13;
been adjusted to take fully into account changes in procurement prices for&#13;
agricultural commodities and productivity changes. The granting of subsidies&#13;
was an expedient--yet expensive--way of buying time to permit the necessary&#13;
wage and price reform legislation to be enacted. In the meantime, price&#13;
subsidies granted by the budget absorb 6 percent of GDP, with additional&#13;
subsidies paid through other channels. On fragmentary information, it seems&#13;
that such an amount is fairly high when compared with the amount of subsidies&#13;
granted by other many countries.20/&#13;
3.39      Stability.  In recent years, the budgetary role of fostering&#13;
economic stability has focused on restraining investment activity. Buoyant&#13;
investment tends to be an endemic problem in China's planned economy; managers&#13;
work under tight output targets and give precedence to attaining quantity over&#13;
20/ Comparison of subsidies across countries is complicated by the fact that&#13;
these subsidies are often granted through permitting losses in state-&#13;
owned enterprises. The financial relations of the budget and banking&#13;
system with these enterprises rarely permits a clear view of these&#13;
subsidies.&#13;

quality; and successive political campaigns have stressed high investment&#13;
targets. While budgetary policy has reflected these trends, it has also been&#13;
a major instrument for implementing corrective policies.&#13;
3.40      Growth and Development.  Since the foundation of the People's&#13;
Republic, China has chosen a growth pattern that has relied on very high&#13;
levels of investment and on a predominant role of the budget in the financing&#13;
of this level of investment. As a share of national income, accumulation has&#13;
ranged from a low of about 10 percent (1962 and 1967-69) to a high of 44 per-&#13;
cent (1959). In most years, the accumulation rate amounted to between 25 and&#13;
33 percent. These investment shares are very high when compared with those of&#13;
other developing countries and are at the level of upper-income&#13;
countries.2-/ Furthermore, the budget has taken a dominant role in mobilizing&#13;
the necessary resources and channeling them to the various sectors.22/&#13;
Functional Breakdown of Future Expenditure Trends in China&#13;
3.41      From the international experience in expenditure developments, one&#13;
is left with the impression of great differences. Yet, the similarities&#13;
suggest that the options of policymakers are limited. First, there is the&#13;
resource constraint. If expenditure is limited to budgetary revenue plus&#13;
foreign borrowing, the resource constraint will be stricter than if substan-&#13;
tial deficit financing is adopted. In many low- and middle-income countries,&#13;
credit from the domestic banking sector and the domestic sale of central&#13;
21/ For low-income economies (except India and China), the average share of&#13;
gross domestic investment to GDP was 14 percent in 1981 and 25 percent&#13;
for both middle-income and upper-income countries. IBRD (1983), Table 5,&#13;
pp. 156-157.&#13;
22/ Up to 1980, 80 to 90 percent of total capital construction investment&#13;
expenditures was channeled through the budget. Since 1980, this share&#13;
has fallen to about 50 percent. China (1984), pp. 323.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
government bonds have supplemented budgetary resources, often jeopardizing&#13;
financial stability and drawing resources away from other sectors in the&#13;
economy. Over the years, China has aimed at a balanced budget policy, or at&#13;
least for a budget deficit not in excess of net foreign capital inflow, and in&#13;
recent years, has received only a small amount of bank credit from the&#13;
People's Bank of China and has sold some Treasury bonds. Whether such a&#13;
policy is the most appropriate one for the next couple of decades is an&#13;
important policy issue, ones that could decisively influence the size of&#13;
budgetary operations. Deficit financing amounted to about 7 percent of GDP in&#13;
a recent sample of 61 deveLoping countries, yet many of these countries had&#13;
serious balance of payments and inflation problems. If China were to increase&#13;
its deficit from about 1.5 percent of GDP 23/ to, for instance, 7 percent of&#13;
GDP, this would allow the budgetary expenditure to expand considerably.&#13;
However, such a policy would have to be coordinated with appropriate policies&#13;
in other sectors, particularly a monetary policy.&#13;
3.42      Budgetary policy is also constrained by the fact that its expendi-&#13;
ture pattern should respond to the shift in demand for public goods and&#13;
services. The international comparison has shown that levels of income and&#13;
demographic factors are the main variables affecting such demand, with&#13;
institutional differences between market and centrally planned economies&#13;
having only limited influence on t:heir structure of recurrent expenditure.&#13;
These factors will now be analyzed with respect to expenditure on investment,&#13;
consumer subsidies, health, and education.&#13;

3.43      Investment.  As noted above, China spends not only a much larger&#13;
share of its GDP on investment than most other low-income countries (20 per-&#13;
cent versus 14 percent), but also channels a larger share of these funds&#13;
through its budget. Capital construction expenditure (that is, investment in&#13;
plant and equipment in state-owned enterprises) alone amounted to 20 percent&#13;
of total budgetary expenditure in 1982 (Table 3.7), while spending on moderni-&#13;

zation and product development amounted to another 4.5 percent.  In this&#13;
respect, China resembles Romania and Hungary which, with per capita income&#13;
levels of $2,100 and $2,540, respectively, invest 30 percent and 33 percent of&#13;
their GDP and devote 21 and 38 percent, respectively, of their total budget to&#13;
capital expenditure.&#13;
3.44      In recent years, economic reforms have given enterprises and local&#13;
authorities both larger financial resources 241 and the authority to use these&#13;
resources. Combined with their incentives to add to their productive capacity&#13;
and to their stock of residential buildings, these authorities have greatly&#13;
expanded their investment activity. As a result, the share in capital con-&#13;
struction expenditure channeled through the budget which amounted to&#13;
80-90 percent as late as 1979 has fallen to only about 50 percent. In an&#13;
effort to stimulate investments in the priority sectors of energy and trans-&#13;
portation, extrabudgetary investments are now more tightly controlled and a&#13;
larger share of investable funds is to be channeled through the budget (for&#13;
example, 10 percent tax on extrabudgetary funds introduced in 1983 and the&#13;
substitution of the profit tax on state-owned enterprises for the profit&#13;
transfer system).&#13;
3.45      Hence, the fall of the share of investment expenditure in the budget&#13;
may not continue and may even be reversed. As a rule of thumb, investment&#13;
expenditure may reclaim about 25 percent of total expenditure,25/ as against&#13;
24 percent in 1980 and 20 percent in 1982. This share could be reduced if&#13;
sizable bank financing of investments of state-owned enterprises were to&#13;

substitute for budgetary resources. Such a substitution has already taken&#13;
place with respect to working capital of state-owned enterprises,26/ and&#13;
through the granting of considerable amounts of short- and medium-term&#13;
equipment loans.&#13;
3.46      Price Subsidies.  In recent years, these subsidies are the most&#13;
rapidly growing component of budgetary expenditure. They are granted mainly&#13;
to daily consumer goods and, to a lesser extent, to agricultural inputs.&#13;
Price subsidies were first granted in 1953, but their scope was gradually&#13;
expanded and by 1984, about 37 commodities were subsidized. Most subsidies&#13;
are granted to foodgrain, edible oil, and cotton. Other subsidized consumer&#13;
goods include meat, eggs, vegetables, and household coal. Agricultural inputs&#13;
benefiting from price subsidies include urea, electric power, and diesel&#13;
fuel. Aside from the subsidies that are explicitly reflected as budgetary&#13;
expenditure, some subsidies are granted by enterprises and local governments,&#13;
and through other budgetary entrees. While no comprehensive estimates are as&#13;
yet available to assess the magnitude of this latter category of subsidies,&#13;
there is now wide agreement that they are considerable.27/&#13;
3.47      In 1982, price subsidies included explicitly in the state budget&#13;
amounted to Y 32 billion, double the amount for 1979, which itself was twice&#13;
as high as in 1978. These subsidies rose most rapidly in 1979 and 1980 when&#13;
the increase in procurement prices for agricultural goods was not matched by&#13;
26/ Such working capital amounted to about 2 percent of GDP in both 1957 and&#13;
1977, but only 0.5 of GDP in 1982.&#13;
27/ The State Planning Commission estimated that rent subsidies of Y 3.5 bil-&#13;
lion were granted in 1979-81; urban transportation enterprises often run&#13;
large deficits. A Government Insurance Scheme is provided free to civil&#13;
servants at a cost of Y 78 million in 1981.&#13;

similar increases in urban retail prices (Table 3.8). Price subsidies for&#13;
daily consumer goods exclusively benefit urban dwellers and amounted to Y 141&#13;
per capita in 1982, slightly less than in 1981 (Y 151). This is equivalent to&#13;
one third of the average per capita income of staff and workers.&#13;

3.48      As pointed out earlier in this paper, the cross-section study has&#13;
shown that welfare and social security expenditure tends to increase with&#13;
increases in per capita income, as such expenditure was intended to reduce&#13;
income differences and provide the less fortunate citizens with a basic&#13;
minimum standard of living. In China, the recent sharp increase was not in&#13;
response to the desire to reduce income disparities and to provide minimum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
living standards. Rather, the subsidies rose sharply because rural terms of&#13;
trade were improved without permitting the cost of living in urban areas to&#13;
increase as a result of it.&#13;
3.49      Had wages and other urban incomes been adjusted upward to compensate&#13;
for higher procurement and retail prices, it would have been possible to avoid&#13;
this sharply rising subsidy expenditure in the budget and to avoid the&#13;
substantial administrative and other costs caused by the subsidy and ration&#13;
schemes. This approach was not taken, because the increases in procurement&#13;
prices in 1979 were decided in a very piecemeal fashion without fully focusing&#13;
on the budgetary implications. Furthermore, Chinese policymakers and the&#13;
public have taken great pride in achieving basic price stability, which would&#13;
have been shattered by the simultaneous increase in retail prices and incomes.&#13;
Also, the wage system is an extremely complex one, being made up of a basic&#13;
wage, wage supplements, and bonuses. It is, therefore, often maintained in&#13;
China that to calculate an increase in the take-home pay of staff and workers&#13;
that compensates fully for retail price increases would be immensely complex.&#13;
In that view, a wage reform would have to precede the elimination of the price&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
3.50      Most countries rely on social security and welfare systems to&#13;
eliminate the extremes of income distribution. These systems require large&#13;
expenditures. In Table 3.4, it was shown that budget expenditure on social&#13;
security and welfare were positively related not only to per capita income,&#13;
but also, and independently, to the share of the population 65 years and older&#13;
and the share of the labor force in industry. Current forecasts anticipate a&#13;

considerable aging of the population by the year 2000,28/ and a gradual&#13;
increase in the share of the industrial labor force. On both accounts then,&#13;
and to the extent that the international experience is relevant for China,&#13;
China should anticipate that its social security and welfare expenditure will&#13;
increase. Depending on the institutional arrangements, such expenditure might&#13;
appear explicitly in the budget or might result in higher costs for local&#13;
authorities and enterprises, and ultimately in reduced budgetary revenue.&#13;
Official statements, made in connection with the promotion of the one-child&#13;
family and the future burden on these single children for the welfare of their&#13;
parents and grandparents, already suggest that the need for a better articu-&#13;
lated social security and welfare system is being perceived.29/&#13;
3.51      Income inequalities betwieen provinces and between rural and urban&#13;
areas may also tend to become gradually less acceptable. State policies to&#13;
alleviate these inequalities have, in the past, relied on equalizing the&#13;
supply of public services across provinces by requiring rich provinces to&#13;
transfer a share of their tax revenue to the state budget, which in turn&#13;
transfers them to poor provinces. This income equalization policy may have to&#13;
be expanded, but its cost will not directly appear in the budget as "welfare&#13;
and social security payments," but under the heading of other functional&#13;
expenditure categories.&#13;
3.52      In short, the future developments of welfare and social security&#13;
payments are very uncertain and depend on how much income inequality within&#13;

increase from 5 percent (the 1982 census) to about 9 percent in 2000.&#13;

and between regions will be accepted and what methods will be adopted to&#13;
reduce inequalities. Also, it will depend on the extent to which the living&#13;
standard of urban workers will be protected by a system of overemployment in&#13;
state and collective enterprises, supplemented by a growing private sector or&#13;
whether the hardship of unemployment will be mitigated by a system of social&#13;
security and welfare payments. In this choice, much more is involved than&#13;
financial transactions and budgetary responsibilities. Yet, one might antici-&#13;
pate that the budget will have to accommodate larger social welfare payments,&#13;
although in the medium term, these transfers may not have to be as large as&#13;
those in the average to middle-income country (that is, 3 percent of GDP)&#13;
because of China's present wage and employment policies.&#13;
3.53      Health Expenditure.30' China's total national expenditure on public&#13;
health is estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP. This is slightly higher than the&#13;
2.7 percent of GDP which was expected from the analysis of the relation&#13;
between public health expenditure and GDP in a sample of 19 countries. In&#13;
that study, the income elasticity of public health expenditure was estimated&#13;
at 1.2. The budget finances about 30 percent of total health expenditure,&#13;
placing budget-financed public health expenditure at close to 1 percent of&#13;
GDP.31/&#13;
3.54      This share of health expenditure in the budget is only about half&#13;
what budgets in other low-income countries spend on public health (1.9 per-&#13;
cent, see Table 3.2) or what would be expected from the relations documented&#13;
30/ This discussion is largely based on IBRD (1984a) and on the supplementary&#13;
papers prepared for that report.&#13;
31/ IBRD (1984a), pp. 64 and 78. These shares are very close to the&#13;
0.8 percent share given in Table 3.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
by the Tait and Heller study (Table 3.4), according to which China's budgetary&#13;
health expenditure was expected to be 2.3 percent of GDP. Despite the low&#13;
share of public health expenditure in the budget, China's achievement in&#13;
public health is impressive; life excpectancy exceeds that of other developing&#13;
countries (67 years against 50 years) and of middle-income countries (60&#13;
years) and is similar to that of upper middle-income countries (65&#13;
years).321 China's emphasis on preventive medicine, the large share of total&#13;
health expenditure paid outside the budget, and the fact that salaries of its&#13;
medical personnel are lower than that in other countries 331 probably explain&#13;
most of this low share of health expenditure in the budget.&#13;
3.55      An aspect of China's health expenditure with a bearing on their&#13;
future development is the substantial differences in state health expenditure&#13;
across provinces and autonomous regions. Higher-income provinces spend much&#13;
more on health than low-income provinces, and urban areas spend much more than&#13;
rural areas. In fact, 1981 state health expenditure in urban areas amounted&#13;
to Y 26.2 per capita as against Y 2.8 in the rural areas.341 Similarly, large&#13;
differences exist between provinces.&#13;
3.56      The share of total health expenditure in GDP will probably increase&#13;
in the future and so will the share of such expenditure in the budget. The&#13;
32/ IBRD (1983), Table 1, pp. 148-149.&#13;
33/  In China only 24 percent of total health expenditure is accounted for by&#13;
salaries for medical personnel UIBRD 1984a, p. 76). This expenditure is&#13;
higher in most other countries where salaries of health personnel&#13;
substantially exceed those in other sectors in the economy. In China,&#13;
salaries of health personnel are very low in the rural areas; in urban&#13;
areas they are about the same as the salary and wages of staff and&#13;
workers in state-owned enterprises.&#13;
34/ IBRD (1984a) p. 66.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
reasons for this are: (a) the gradual aging of the population will cause&#13;
expensive curative and caring medicine to increase at a time when most of the&#13;
benefits of preventive medicine have already been reaped in many areas;&#13;
(b) the income elasticity for medical expenditure exceeds 1.0 in most&#13;
countries that have been studied, in part because of the demand for quality&#13;
medicine, which relies on more advanced and expensive technology; and (c)&#13;
large disparities in medical expenditure across the country may become more&#13;
unacceptable, requiring greater efforts by the public sector in the rural&#13;
areas where about 80 percent of the population resides.&#13;
3.57      It is difficult to quantify these trends which will all be working&#13;
at the same time.  Yet the Heller-Tait study suggests that a 1 percent&#13;
increase of the population aged 65 years and older tends to increase the share&#13;
of budgetary expenditure on health in GDP by 0.12 percent. Hence, if between&#13;
now and the year 2000 this group of the population increases from 5 percent to&#13;
9 percent,-5/ one could expect sizable upward pressure on expenditure (maybe&#13;
0.5 percent of GDP). Similarly, if an income elasticity of 1.2 were to apply&#13;
to these expenditures, an increase of incomes up to the year 2000 from $250 to&#13;
$800 would mean that health expenditure would increase from about Y 8.25 per&#13;
capita (3.3 percent of GDP) in 1982 to Y 40 per capita (4.9 percent of GDP).&#13;
Although the effects of those two factors on budget expenditure are not&#13;
necessarily cumulative, they could combine to exercise considerable upward&#13;
pressure on total health expenditure in China. If China's budget is to&#13;
continue to shoulder 30 percent of this expenditure, it will have to devote a&#13;
larger amount of resources to that purpose. Forecasting such expenditure as&#13;
35/ This implies a more than doubling of the number of people in this age&#13;
group between 1980 and 2000 (IBRD 1984a) Vol. II, Table A-9.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
1.5 percent of GDP or 5 percent of a budget that itself amounts to 30 percent&#13;
of CDP appears reasonable and conservative.&#13;
3.58      Education.36/  Both as a percentage of its GDP and as a share of its&#13;
total budgetary expenditure, China spends less on education than most develop-&#13;
ing countries. Whereas budgetary excpenditure on education in other low-income&#13;
countries amounts to 2.9 percent of GDP or close to 15 percent of total&#13;
budgetary expenditure, in China those shares are only 2 percent and 7 percent,&#13;
respectively. Taking other than budgetary expenditure into account, the&#13;
conclusion that China spends less than other developing countries on educa-&#13;
tion--3 percent versus 4 percent--is confirmed. This may be surprising in&#13;
light of China's educational achievements, which are considerably higher than&#13;
those of other low-income developing countries (for instance, China's literacy&#13;
rate of 69 percent compared with that of other low-income countries of 40 per-&#13;
cent). A major reason for this low total spending on education is the low&#13;
unit cost of education in primary education, which can be traced to low&#13;
salaries of teaching staff andl underspending on educational materials and&#13;
buildings. Unit costs in China's primary education, in terms of percentage of&#13;
GNP/capita, is only one third of that in other developing countries; in&#13;
secondary education it is the same, but it is 10 times as high for tertiary&#13;
education. Salaries constitute a smaller share of total recurrent costs of&#13;
education (60 percent, 50 percent, and 30-35 percent in primary, secondary,&#13;
and tertiary education, respectively) than in other developing countries&#13;
(90 percent, 60-75 percent, and 40-45 percent, respectively). Teachers'&#13;
36/ This section is largely based on. the paper by IBRD (1984b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
salaries at the primary school level, although somewhat raised in recent&#13;
years, still appear low.&#13;
3.59      In the future, budgetary expenditure on education will be affected&#13;
by different pressures. First, there is the goal to introduce a nine-year&#13;
basic education system, a diversified secondary school system that would&#13;
enroll 50 percent of students in technical and vocational programs, and a&#13;
doubling in university enrollment. Second, the demographic shift in popula-&#13;
tion will reduce the number of school-age children. Third, a considerable&#13;
effort will need to be made in the construction of new buildings and the&#13;
rehabilitation of existing ones.&#13;
3.60      Recurrent costs of providing universal primary education will&#13;
increase considerably between now and the year 2000 as the number of primary&#13;
students increase by about 10 percent. The recurrent cost of expanded&#13;
secondary education will be expensive, mainly because of the quadrupling of&#13;
students in upper-secondary education. The number of teachers in secondary&#13;
schools will have to be increased considerably--the actual increase being&#13;
dependent on the development in the student/teacher ratio. The increased&#13;
enrollment in technical and vocational programs will turn out to be very&#13;
expensive as the cost per student enrolled in these schools is about 5 to 10&#13;
times higher than for students enrolled in general secondary schools. The&#13;
doubling of university enrollment will also require substantially larger&#13;
resources. Yet, there is considerable scope for savings in staff, space, and&#13;
equipment utilization in this sector.&#13;
3.61      By the year 2000, substantial capital expenditure will have to be&#13;
made, mainly to accommodate the large increase of students in secondary and&#13;
vocational schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
3.62      Table 3.9 gives a summary of budgetary expenditure that might be&#13;
required to fulfill these goals by t:he year 2000. These estimates are&#13;
approximations based on the most recent data and assuming that several cost-&#13;
saving measures will be implemented. Total recurrent expenditure may turn out&#13;
to be about Y 35 billion in 2000 comipared with Y 13.5 billion in 1982. To&#13;
this, one may add the expenditure fcr acquisition of equipment of about&#13;
Y 21 billion in the period 1983-2000, or somewhat more than Y 1 billion a&#13;
year. The expenditure for additional school buildings was not estimated&#13;
because of lack of data. Total budgetary expenditure of Y 36 billion out of a&#13;
GNP of Y 1.7 trillion (four times the level of 1980) amounts to 2.1 percent,&#13;
or about the same share as in 1982. Even when capital expenditure is added to&#13;
this amount, it appears that China's educational goals can be attained without&#13;
undue financial stress. This implies, however, that teachers' salaries&#13;
increase no faster than GNP per capita and that several measures be imple-&#13;
mented to reduce recurrent costs. However, rising incomes in the rural areas,&#13;
in part due to the introduction of the production responsibility system, and&#13;
the realization that teachers' pay is low by any standard, may result in an&#13;
upward adjustment of teachers' salar:ies in rural areas. This would, of&#13;
course, result in additional budgetary allocations.&#13;

4. REVENUE DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
4.01      This chapter reviews generally observed patterns in the level and&#13;
structure of the tax system during the development process, discusses the most&#13;
relevant underlying factors determining changes in the patterns of taxation in&#13;
developing countries, and examines their relevance for China.&#13;
4.02      In the economic literature, many studies have analyzed trends in&#13;
taxation during the development process.37/ These studies vary in terms of&#13;
coverage and methodology. Some studies have examined developing countries&#13;
while others have examined the evolution of the now developed countries. In&#13;
their methodology, some studies have relied on time-series data, others on&#13;
cross-section analysis.&#13;
37/ Some of the most relevant studies are those of Chelliah (1971) Goode&#13;
(1984), Musgrave (1969), Hinricks (1966), and Tanzi (forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
4.03      Findings of most studies are largely in agreement in concluding that&#13;
higher levels of development are generally associated with increasing shares&#13;
of taxation in economic activity. The above conclusion is largely a factual&#13;
observation and not a theory that could support a cause-effect relationship.&#13;
Therefore, higher levels of taxation are not necessary to achieve higher&#13;
levels of development, or vice versa, despite the fact that the two phenomena&#13;
are generally associated. In what follows, findings of relevant studies are&#13;
reviewed and tentative explanations of the factors that have determined trends&#13;
on taxation are presented.&#13;
Review of Studies on the Evolution of Taxes During the Development Process&#13;
Trends in the Level of Taxation&#13;
4.04      The results of some important time-series studies on the level of&#13;
taxation are summarized and combined below. Table 4.1 below presents the&#13;
evolution of the level of taxation for eight developing countries which have&#13;
shown significant development during the last few decades. It shows three&#13;
time periods: 1953-55, 1966-68, and 1978-80.&#13;
4.05      The average tax burden--defined as the ratio of tax collections to&#13;
gross national product--shows a steady increase over time. It rose, first, by&#13;
nearly 40 percent (from 9.7 percent of GNP in the 1953-55 period to 13.4 per-&#13;
cent of GNP in 1966-68) and, thereafter, continued rising by a further 30 per-&#13;
cent, reaching 17.3 percent of GNP in the 1978-80 period. While all countries&#13;
of the sample showed an increase in t:ax burden, those countries which had a&#13;
lower initial level of taxation (such as Korea, India, and Pakistan) showed a&#13;
sharper increase in their tax burden rates. Those countries which had a&#13;
higher initial level of taxation (Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Brazil) showed a&#13;

smaller increase in tax burden. As a result, by the end of the period&#13;
(1978-80), the tax ratios for all countries in the sample became more&#13;
homogeneous than was the case 25 years earlier.&#13;
4.06      Broad-based, cross-section studies that have compared levels of&#13;
development of several countries with the corresponding levels of taxation&#13;
have also concluded that higher levels of development are generally associated&#13;
with higher levels of taxation. A recent study compared levels of economic&#13;
development (measured by GDP per capita) with levels of taxation (measured by&#13;
taxation to GDP) for over 80 developing countries during the 1977-80 period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(Table 4.2). Countries with lower levels of development (countries with&#13;
average per capita income of arouncl $200 but not exceeding $300) tend to have&#13;
much lower levels of taxation (13 percent of GDP) than countries in higher-&#13;
income groups. The level of taxation for the two intermediate groups (with&#13;
average per capita income of $510 and $1,086) is much higher than the former&#13;
group but there is no significant clifference between them: 18.5 percent and&#13;
17.8 percent of GDP, respectively; while the level of taxation for developing&#13;
countries with higher per capita income (averaging $2,540) reaches over&#13;
20.5 percent of GDP. In brief, as countries develop, tax revenue seems to&#13;
grow faster than income. This then appears to permit the share of government&#13;
expenditure in GDP to grow when incomes grow.&#13;

4.07      Tax elasticity and tax buoyancy coefficients measure the relation-&#13;
ship between changes in the overall tax levels and the corresponding percent-&#13;
age increase in GDP. Coefficients higher than one indicate that taxation grew&#13;
faster than GDP; a coefficient of one means that taxation grew at the same&#13;
rate as GDP; and a coefficient smaller than one indicates that taxation grew&#13;
at a slower rate than GDP. The automatic response of tax collections to&#13;
higher levels of income, in the absence of any discretionary measure affecting&#13;
tax flows, is measured by the tax elasticity coefficient. This coefficient,&#13;
therefore, measures the built-in response of taxation to income. On the other&#13;
hand, the flow of taxes may also reflect the impact of measures taken by the&#13;
authorities as they seek to boost revenue, promote specific activities, or&#13;
pursue other economic objectives. Such measures create new or eliminate&#13;
existing taxes, change the rate of existing taxes, grant and eliminate exemp-&#13;
tions or special incentives and changes in tax administration or tax enforce-&#13;
ment. The overall performance of taxation--including the effect of built-in&#13;
responses and discrete measures--is measured by the tax buoyancy coefficient,&#13;
which is defined as the ratio between the rate of growth of taxation (includ-&#13;
ing the effect of automatic responses as well as that of discrete measures)&#13;
and the rate of growth of income.&#13;
4.08      A comprehensive study on tax buoyancies for 27 countries over a 13-&#13;
year period (from 1953-55 to 1966-68) shows an average coefficient of 1.4&#13;
(Table 4.3). This coefficient indicates that the rate of growth of overall&#13;
tax collections has been 40 percent faster than the corresponding growth in&#13;
GNP in this period. Between 1953-55 and 1966-68, and with only one exemption,&#13;
taxes grew either at a faster rate than, or at a largely similar, rate to GDP.&#13;

Trends in the Tax Structure&#13;
4.09      Time-series as well as cross-section studies show that through the&#13;
development process, income taxes and taxes on domestic production and con-&#13;
sumption gain in relative importance at the expense of taxes on international&#13;
trade and other smaller taxes. This conclusion is somewhat oversimplified in&#13;
that it is based on the breakdown of total tax revenue only in very few&#13;
categories. Hence, it masks important changes in the tax structure that take&#13;
place within the categories used. For example, the substitution of the value-&#13;
added tax for cascading commodity taxes does not appear when all commodity&#13;
taxes are lumped together, despite the fact that such a substitution&#13;
constitutes a considerable improvement of the previous commodity tax system.&#13;
4.10      The developments in the tax structure during development are largely&#13;
explained by the development of readily available taxable bases (tax handles)&#13;
and by advances in the taxation techniques and a better understanding of the&#13;
economic impact of various taxes.&#13;
4.11      It is generally accepted that, as development progresses, more&#13;
favorable conditions are created for the use of income taxes or of more&#13;
sophisticated commodity taxes. Because of these conditions, it becomes less&#13;
necessary to rely on those taxes that have disincentive effects (for instance,&#13;
export taxes) or that unduly discriminate against the consumption of imports.&#13;
In the early stages of development, taxes are collected in a simple institu-&#13;
tional environment where production takes place in a small-scale--mainly&#13;
rural--environment, which precludes the levying of taxes that require more&#13;
than the most rudimentary accounting systems. Hence, land taxes, taxation of&#13;
exterior signs of luxury consumption, and taxation of foreign trade are very&#13;
important sources of budgetary revenue. When development progresses, produc-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
tion and distribution take place in a much more structured environment; finan-&#13;
cial institutions become articulate, large-scale industry gains in importance,&#13;
and wage payments become a large source of household income. Domestic indus-&#13;
trial production gains with respect to imports and their exemption from taxa-&#13;
tion becomes less acceptable, while a more literate taxpayer population keeps&#13;
more sophisticated accounts.&#13;
4.12      In addition to the development of the economic structure, new taxa-&#13;
tion techniques were introduced in some countries and gained gradual accep-&#13;
tance in others. Value-added taxation, for instance, was first introduced in&#13;
France, spread to the European Economic Community, and is now adopted in many&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
4.13      The results of two broad-based studies on the evolution of the tax&#13;
structure throughout the development process are summarized in Table 4.4&#13;
below. This table combines the results of two different studies. The first&#13;
three columns of Table 4.4 show changes in the structure of taxation as&#13;
derived from a broad-based, cross-section study of some 85 countries, while&#13;
the latter three columns show the results of a time-series study of some 30&#13;
countries over a 13-year period (from 1953-55 to 1966-68). Although the two&#13;
studies are not fully comparable--the later study has a narrower tax base as&#13;
it does not include social security taxes--both studies suggest that during&#13;
development, the relative share of taxes on international trade tends to&#13;
decline while the share of income taxes tends to increase. The trend of taxes&#13;
on domestic goods and services seems less consistent.  The cross-section study&#13;
shows a five-point decline in their share in total tax revenue. This,&#13;
however, does not reflect a declining reliance on these taxes (Table 4.1 shows&#13;
that, as a share of CDP, these tax receipts increase when income increases);&#13;

Lower levels of development correspond to countries with a per capita&#13;
income of less than $300 and intermediate level of development&#13;
corresponds to developing countries with an average per capita income of&#13;
$1,086.&#13;

levels of development" corresponds to data of the 1953-55 period, and&#13;
that of "intermediate levels of development" corresponds to the same&#13;
countries in the 1966-68 period.&#13;
/c   Data exclude social security taxes.&#13;
rather it results from the sharp growth in income taxes and receipts from&#13;
social security taxes. The time-series study, on the other hand, indicates an&#13;
eight-point increase in their share of total taxes, in part because this study&#13;
does not include the revenue from social security taxes which rose sharply and&#13;
which were included in the cross-section study. The basic trends of changes&#13;
in the structure of taxation are confined in a broad-based, cross-section&#13;
study prepared by Goode (1984) (Table 4.5).&#13;

4.14      As stated earlier, furthLer insights into the changes in the struc-&#13;
ture of taxes are revealed through more disaggregated analysis of the share of&#13;
individual tax categories in total tax revenue (Table 4.6).&#13;
4.15      Income taxes are again shown to rise in relative importance with&#13;
rising incomes. The share of corporate income taxes more than doubles when&#13;
moving from countries in the lower to the higher per capita income bracket,&#13;
reflecting the fact that, with development, more and more production takes&#13;
place in the corporate sector which is easier to tax than the noncorporate&#13;
sector. The professional literature does not agree on the final resting place&#13;
of the corporate income taxes. There are some researchers 38/ who believe&#13;
that a large share of corporate income taxes is reflected in higher output&#13;

prices, in which case the distinction between them and commodity taxes is not&#13;
as strong as it would appear from statistics such as those of Table 4.6. On&#13;
the other hand, other researchers       believe that corporate income taxes&#13;
reduce the return to capital and, as such, are correctly termed "income"&#13;
taxes.&#13;
4.16      Personal income taxes also increase their share of total taxes&#13;
although their growth is not as rapid as that of corporate taxes. But when&#13;
personal income taxes are grouped together with social security contributions,&#13;
which is legitimate as both draw largely from the same base, their rate of&#13;
growth and relative size rise markedly. Their combined share increases from&#13;
12.5 percent to 27.5 percent of total taxes, as one moves from countries in&#13;
the lower to the higher per capital income bracket.&#13;
4.17      The share of taxes on domestic goods and services fall slightly.&#13;
These taxes are a heterogeneous group. Some are of a general nature, such as&#13;
the general sales tax and the value-added tax, while others are excise taxes&#13;
on liquor, cigarettes, luxury goods, jewelry, cars, motorcycles, and travel.&#13;
In the general sales taxes, no distinction is made between those turnover&#13;
taxes with a cascading effect and those that avoid such an effect. Hence, the&#13;
broad categories in which these taxes are grouped will, of necessity, give&#13;
only some general indications of the patterns of changes. As is shown in&#13;
Table 4.6, column 9, collections frorn general sales and turnover taxes account&#13;
for over 13 percent of total taxes in countries with lower levels of per&#13;
capita income, but they account for only about 8 percent of total taxes for&#13;
the other developing countries. However, to the extent that the overall tax&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
burden (as a proportion to GDP) increases with higher levels of development,&#13;
this decline in tax does not necessarily imply that its collections fall in&#13;
relation to GDP. On the contrary, the share of these falls in GDP rises from&#13;
3.8 percent to 5.1 percent when going from poor countries to countries with a&#13;
higher per capita income (Table 4.2). Collections from selective taxes on&#13;
domestic goods and services show a fairly stable pattern, accounting for about&#13;
11 percent of total taxation in all groups of countries. Only for countries&#13;
with lower per capita income are the revenues of excise taxes less important&#13;
than those of more general commodity taxes.&#13;
4.18      Table 4.6 also shows that the sharp decline in the relative share of&#13;
taxes on foreign trade is a result of a relative decline in both import duties&#13;
and export taxes. The decline is steady across the different country groups.&#13;
Import duties fall from 32 percent to 18 percent of total taxes, but are still&#13;
the second-most important revenue source after corporate income taxes. Export&#13;
taxes fall from 11 percent to less than 3 percent of total taxes, in part&#13;
reflecting the widely shared conviction that only in exceptional circumstances&#13;
can export taxes avoid harming the export sector.&#13;
Conclusions from the International Experience&#13;
4.19      The evolution of the tax system reflects not only changes in the&#13;
structure of the economy, but also changes in the policy objectives of the&#13;
governments and the use of taxation as an instrument to achieve new policy&#13;
objectives such as income distribution, stabilization, and economic growth.&#13;
International differences in tax structure also reflect the specific social&#13;
and political structure of each country and the role assigned to the govern-&#13;
ment. Countries with centrally planned economies often assign fewer objec-&#13;
tives to tax policy than market economies because wage and price policies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
combined with central planning, tencl to implement some of the policy objec-&#13;
tives that in market economies are the realm of tax policy. The tax structure&#13;
may also depend on the required level of tax revenue as with higher revenue&#13;
requirements; it becomes difficult not to rely on every potential tax base,&#13;
irrespective of the economic and efficiency implications. In turn, the&#13;
required level of taxation depends, inter alia, on the scope of budgetary&#13;
responsibilities undertaken by governments.&#13;

4.20      Options for changing the structure of taxation in developing&#13;
countries must give due attention to the economic conditions prevailing in the&#13;
country as these impose severe limitations on the structure of the tax system.&#13;
4.21      Low-income countries are often characterized by a large agricultural&#13;
sector, small-scale and scattered industrial production, the small share of&#13;
the total work force earning wages, and foreign trade tending to be very&#13;
important. Those circumstances limit tax policy options, often resulting in&#13;
the reliance on taxes that are inefficient, arbitrary, and discriminatory.&#13;
Presumptive taxation, compulsory delivery of agricultural produce at below-&#13;
market prices, and export taxes are often used to tax the agricultural&#13;
sector.  Heavy reliance on commodity taxation, inclusive of import taxes and&#13;
excise taxes, is used to extract the major budgetary contribution from the&#13;
urban areas. With wage employment and other incomes (rents, interests, small&#13;
business income) widely scattered and difficult to account for, individual&#13;
income taxation is mainly limited to civil servants and employees of large&#13;
firms, and contributes little to overall budgetary revenue. Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
taxation, except for the very few large--often foreign-owned--firms, is often&#13;
calculated on a presumptive basis, so that these taxes tend to reflect sales&#13;
rather than income. In addition, revenue needs encourage low-income develop-&#13;
ing countries to exploit all possible tax bases, often resulting in the&#13;
existence of a large number of taxes, each of which raises only small amounts&#13;
of revenue.&#13;
4.22      When the economy develops, these often primitive methods of taxation&#13;
gradually lose their raison d'etre and should be replaced by taxes that are&#13;
more attuned to the more advanced stage of development. Hence, tax reform&#13;
should be a continuing preoccupation of the budgetary authorities. Old taxes&#13;
should be perfected or removed and new taxes should be introduced. In this&#13;
process, the experience of other countries can be used as a guide as it&#13;
suggests the direction that can be taken, shows what is feasible, and permits&#13;
mistakes to be avoided. However, the international experience has its limita-&#13;
tions, certainly in the case of China whose economy differs greatly from that&#13;
of the countries whose data were used in the statistics referred to earlier in&#13;
this chapter. One of the limitations pertains to the fact that no country's&#13;
tax structure is perfect; all could benefit from reform. Thus, the average of&#13;
these imperfect tax structures cannot possibly be used as a "norm" for China.&#13;
They hint at what is possible, not at what should be. Furthermore, the&#13;
deviation from the mean in the sample studied is also rather large, suggesting&#13;
that there are many exceptions to the trends referred to above.&#13;
4.23      Based on the international experience and some widely recognized&#13;
criteria for an ideal tax system, some remarks on the present taxation system&#13;
in China are now presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Tax Reform in China&#13;
4.24      China's tax system should be evaluated in light of the objectives it&#13;
must implement. It may be useful to analyze to what extent China's tax system&#13;
is aimed at fulfilling the objectives of allocation, distribution, stabiliza-&#13;
tion, and growth and development mentioned in Chapter 2 of this paper. To&#13;
implement these objectives, the tax system should be buoyant, neutral, predic-&#13;
table, and efficient. These criteria will now be discussed in turn.&#13;
4.25      Buoyancy.  If government expenditure tends to grow at the same rate&#13;
as GDP, taxes should also follow this growth pattern if deficits are not to&#13;
emerge. If government expenditures are to grow more rapidly than GDP--and the&#13;
international comparison showed that this has been the case in the past--the&#13;
budgetary revenue should grow more rapidly than GDP, that is, the revenue&#13;
buoyancy should exceed unity. In recent years, the buoyancy of budgetary&#13;
revenue was only 0.5, namely, revenue rose only about half as fast as GDP. As&#13;
a result, the share of revenue as a 'percentage of GDP fell from 32.2 percent&#13;
in 1979 to 29 percent in 1982 (Table 4.7). The buoyancy of revenue from the&#13;
consolidated industrial and commercial tax (CICT), which in 1982 amounted to&#13;
40 percent of total budgetary revenue, was 1.2. Profit remittances to the&#13;
budget stagnated and, because they amounted to about half of total budgetary&#13;
revenue, were the main cause of the overall low buoyancy of total budgetary&#13;
revenue. Some small budgetary revenue categories rose rapidly while others&#13;
fell or again stagnated. Customs duties (3 percent of the total) rose sharply&#13;
as a result of higher imports, while income taxes from collective enterprises&#13;
(14 percent of total) kept pace with GDP growth. Receipts from the agricul-&#13;
tural tax and depreciation funds (each 2 percent of total) stagnated. Agri-&#13;
cultural tax receipts stagnated as they were kept stable to stimulate agricul-&#13;

4.26      The stagnation of profit remittances from state-owned enterprises&#13;
was caused by the reforms affecting state enterprises, which let them retain&#13;
for their own use a much larger share of their total profits than before. The&#13;
growth in the CICT revenue reflects the substantial industrial output growth&#13;
in the 1979-82 period.40/&#13;
4.27      Restoring the buoyancy of budgetary revenue should be a priority of&#13;
tax reform in the next few years. It is also perceived as such by the Chinese&#13;
40/ Profits and taxes are a higher share of gross output in heavy than in&#13;
light industry (25.4 percent versus 19.5 percent) in 1982; China (1984),&#13;
p. 293. As such, budgetary revenue should tend to be less buoyant in&#13;
years such as 1981 when light industrial output growth was combined with&#13;
a decline in heavy industry, as compared with years where heavy industry&#13;
grows faster than light (for instance, 1982). However, this underlying&#13;
trend does not show up in the aggregate data, as during the last few&#13;
years, many other factors influenced revenue trends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
authorities who aim at increasing the share of budgetary revenue in GDP.41/&#13;
Several measures are presently being introduced to raise the buoyancy of&#13;
budgetary revenues.&#13;
(a) Income taxes on state-owned enterprises are introduced to substitute&#13;
the transfer of profits to the budget. The present system is, of&#13;
necessity, a complex one: a basic tax rate of 55 percent, plus a&#13;
readjustment tax that guarantees that the enterprise income taxes&#13;
are similar to the profit transfers of 1982, plus a scheme that&#13;
permits enterprises to retain a larger share of their increased&#13;
profits. Such an elaborate system was chosen because of the&#13;
distorted price system that causes profitability across sectors to&#13;
vary widely. The tax system provides incentives for an enterprise&#13;
to increase its profitability, as its marginal profit retention&#13;
exceeds the average profit retention. It is, thereby, hoped that&#13;
enterprise profitability, a condition sine qua non for improved tax&#13;
buoyancy, will be enhanced.&#13;
(b) Exemptions and lower tax rates, granted to commune- and brigade-run&#13;
enterprises to assist them in their early years, were frequently&#13;
retained beyond the time period originally intended. As of 1983,&#13;
the tax regime of many of these enterprises was normalized, a move&#13;
that should benefit budgetary revenue.&#13;
4.28      The present experimentations with a value-added tax (VAT) in the&#13;
machinery, electric fan, sewing machine, and bicycle sectors are not intended&#13;
41/  Minister Wang Bingqian (China Daily, April 5, 1984, p. 4) stated that&#13;
revenue should amount to 30 percent, or at least 28 percent of national&#13;
income, as against 26.6 percent in 1983. He referred to the Chinese&#13;
definition of revenue and national income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
to raise additional revenue, as output prices are not to be affected by the&#13;
change. However, it appears that budgetary revenue could suffer from the&#13;
introduction of the VAT, as VAT rates on some final output are about the same&#13;
as the CICT rates, thereby foregoing most of the tax revenue that, under the&#13;
CICT regime, was paid on the inputs incorporated in the final VAT commodity.42/&#13;
Before introducing the VAT to other sectors of the economy, this issue should&#13;
be carefully monitored.&#13;
4.29      Agricultural income has risen sharply in the last few years.  Gross&#13;
value of industrial output (GVAO, inclusive of output of the brigade-run&#13;
enterprises), rose by 22 percent between 1979 and 1980, while per capita rural&#13;
income rose by 69 percent. Although some of the increase in per capita income&#13;
results from increases in the industrial production by brigade and team-run&#13;
enterprises 43/ which are taxed separately, the more prosperous rural sector&#13;
did not increase its contribution to budgetary revenue. This situation should&#13;
be reversed if the buoyancy of the overall budgetary revenue is to be&#13;
improved. Yet this will not be an easy matter if the experience of other&#13;
developing countries, where agricultural taxation has often proven elusive, is&#13;
relevant for China.&#13;
4.30      In many countries, income taxes--both on individual income and&#13;
enterprises' revenue--have proven to be most buoyant. This comes because the&#13;

value of agricultural output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
relative share in national income of the income tax bases (wages, revenues of&#13;
modern, often industrial enterprises) tends to grow. To the extent that&#13;
China's economic development will broadly follow the same structural changes,&#13;
it might be advisable to structure the tax system in such a way as to take&#13;
maximum advantage of this change, unless revenue as a share of GDP falls.&#13;
4.31      Neutrality.  Taxation should aim to be neutral with respect to its&#13;
economic impact, unless a nonneutral impact is desired. Neutrality pertains&#13;
to effects on consumption, production, income distribution, location of&#13;
production, etc. A truly neutral tax would have uniform commodity taxes on&#13;
both domestic production and imports, a proportional tax on all individual&#13;
incomes--including the prorated share of an individual's share in collectively&#13;
run enterprises, and agricultural income--and a uniform tax on state-,&#13;
brigade-, and team-run industrial enterprises. For administrative reasons,&#13;
but mainly because the tax system is to achieve a multitude of objectives,&#13;
many deviations of neutrality are built into the tax system. Table 4.8 lists&#13;
a few of the nonneutral aspects of the Chinese tax system, together with a&#13;
suggestion of their objectives. Some of these objectives are fully shared by&#13;
many other developing countries (for example, attract foreign investment, use&#13;
progressive rates in income taxation, discriminate against imports), while&#13;
others are unique to China (tax measures to get around the effects of the&#13;
irrational price system).&#13;
4.32      The programs of tax reform should closely analyze each one of these&#13;
nonneutral elements, query their purpose, and analyze whether or not there is&#13;
a more efficient way of achieving the objective. The outcome of such an&#13;
analysis would leave quite a number of nonneutral elements in the tax system,&#13;
but may well establish that the multitude of commodity tax rates and customs&#13;

have to be relied upon for some time to come. Yet, its administration should&#13;
aim at the greatest possible uniformity and clarity.&#13;
4.33      It must be recognized, however, that the full dividend of generating&#13;
a more neutral tax system will only be realized when taxes are viewed as&#13;
economic instruments and allowed to function as such. This is not possible if&#13;
administrative orders, quotas, an,d other management restrictions, rather than&#13;
prices and taxes, guide resource allocation.&#13;
4.34      Predictability.  Economic agents need certainty with respect to&#13;
their tax liability if they are to take such tax liability into account in&#13;
their decisionmaking. This is true as much for consumers as for industrial&#13;
producers. The absence of such piredictability will have agents adjusting&#13;
their actions so as to minimize their tax liability, in the process going&#13;
counter to the other objectives of the tax system. The predictability&#13;
criterion requires that the tax system is both clear and certain.&#13;
4.35      Clarity requires that tax rules leave little or no scope for&#13;
interpretation. Clear legal provisions and accounting rules must be estab-&#13;
lished and adhered to, so that both taxpayer and tax administration have a&#13;
clear and agreed-upon understanding of determining the taxpayer's profits and&#13;
obligations. Precise definitions of costs, tax bases, and allowable deduc-&#13;
tions, etc. become more crucial when enterprises have a stake in their own&#13;
profitability.  As such, the enterprise reforms initiated in 1979, and even&#13;
more so the 1983 reform of the tax:ation of the income of state-owned enter-&#13;
prises, require improved standards of accounting. It is not clear whether&#13;
present accounting standards and norms meet these higher requirements. If not,&#13;
there is undue scope for the manipulation of accounts, not necessarily&#13;
criminal, by the enterprises, and for adjustments made by the tax administra-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
tion. In that case, final settlement of disputes may rely more on the clever-&#13;
ness and bargaining strength of those involved, rather than on clear-cut&#13;
accounting rules and legal provisions.44/ The efforts presently under way to&#13;
improve the accounting standards should make the work of auditing of enter-&#13;
prises' accounts a much simpler task than it is at present. Concomitantly,&#13;
the technical skills of enterprise accountants should also be raised.&#13;
4.36      Certainty of taxation relates to the fact that, if taxes are to&#13;
enter the decisionmaking process of the taxpayer, the taxpayer should be&#13;
reasonably sure what tax rules will apply during the time period relevant for&#13;
his decisionmaking. Hence, certainty argues for relative stability. This&#13;
requirement was well understood when the Chinese administration decided that&#13;
the 1979 profit retention agreements were to remain for five years and that&#13;
the contracts with farmers under the production responsibility system could&#13;
last up to 15 years. However, recent tax reforms do not seem to provide the&#13;
decisionmakers with the necessary stability of tax regimes. The 1983 income&#13;
tax on enterprises superseded the 1979 retention scheme that was to be in&#13;
effect for at least five years, and that was followed by a totally new taxa-&#13;
tion system of profits of state-owned enterprises in 1984.451 Furthermore,&#13;
although the 1983 system is clearly spelled out, enterprises know that some&#13;
enterprises benefit from still other taxation methods and at times try to&#13;
apply such methods themselves, not being quite sure whether they will be&#13;
44/ If future tax reforms were to introduce resource taxes and taxes on&#13;
working capital and on fixed assets, these difficulties could increase&#13;
considerably.&#13;
45/ In the event, the October 1984 tax reform, among other changes, intro-&#13;
duced a resource tax, widened the application of the value-added tax, and&#13;
changed many rates of the other commodity taxes; the enterprise profit&#13;
tax was left largely unchanged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
permitted to do so or not. The need for certainty argues for a tax reform&#13;
that is well thought through and gradually introduced, not for unplanned and&#13;
uncoordinated fragments of reform measures, unless too much uncertainty&#13;
remains--uncertainty that will undermine the very purpose of the reform.&#13;
4.37      Efficiency.  An efficient tax system is set up to implement its&#13;
objectives; it has a high enforcement rate and low administrative costs.&#13;
Obviously, efficiency is an ideal that can only be approached, never really&#13;
reached.&#13;
4.38      Most taxes have as their primary objective to raise revenue; in&#13;
addition, some taxes have secondary objectives such as redistributing income,&#13;
affecting consumption, or channeling investments toward certain regions or&#13;
sectors. Because of structural differences between economic sectors, it is&#13;
necessary to have several taxes iE each of these sectors is to contribute&#13;
effectively to the budgetary revenue effort. Furthermore, administratively,&#13;
it is often not possible to operal:e a hermetic system where the totality of&#13;
the intended tax base is taxed. Hfence, taxpayers are often subjected to&#13;
several taxes in the hope that all will bear a reasonable share of the total&#13;
tax burden. To the extent that taxes have other than revenue purposes, they&#13;
discriminate among taxpayers according to well-specified criteria. Therefore,&#13;
an efficient tax system tends to be rather complex. In the real world, how-&#13;
ever, tax systems are much more complex than necessary, thereby often under-&#13;
mining their efficiency. The multiplicity of taxes and tax rates often make&#13;
the tax system less transparent than one would wish. These taxes, at times,&#13;
are holdovers from previous periods (often pre-industrial or colonial) or were&#13;
introduced during periods of budgetary crises. In other countries, some taxes&#13;
have a multiplicity of rates as a result of the urge for fine-tuning or simply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
for reasons that are long forgotten. In any event, such a tax system prevents&#13;
any analyst from grasping its incidence with any precision, or from judging&#13;
the revenue and price effects of particular tax changes. Furthermore, tax&#13;
changes may be rendered difficult by the need to submit so many changes to&#13;
legislative procedures, each of which tends to be subjected to objections from&#13;
particular interest groups.&#13;
4.39      In China, the tax system is comprised of relatively few taxes and&#13;
revenue sources, yet many rates apply. For instance, there are hundreds of&#13;
rates of commodity taxes. While, in principle, the rate differentiation&#13;
should permit a progressive impact of the tax burden by applying higher rates&#13;
to these commodities deemed to be "luxury," no one really knows what the final&#13;
tax incidence of the commodity tax is. From the evidence of other countries&#13;
that use highly differentiated rates for their commodity taxes, it would be&#13;
surprising if any substantive income distribution goals are achieved by this&#13;
category of rates.461 Well-designed excise taxes on broad categories of&#13;
luxury commodities can provide a moderate progressivity.471 In this sense,&#13;
there may be justification for having some differentiation of the commodity&#13;
tax rates, yet care should be taken to tax a sizable portion of total consump-&#13;
tion at the "luxury" rates, otherwise the desired progressivity will only be&#13;
an illusion, acquired at significant administrative expense.&#13;
4.40      Another tax with multiple rates is import duty.  As is the case in&#13;
most countries, many rates are stipulated and a detailed product classifica-&#13;
46/ The VAT in the EEC used different rates to achieve income redistributive&#13;
objectives, but to little or no avail. See Luc De Wulf (1983), pp. 360-63.&#13;

Press), Chapter 4.&#13;

tion is provided. The objective of this tariff appears to be to raise&#13;
revenue, protect domestic production, and distribute income. Aside from the&#13;
fact that several of these objectives are contradictory (revenue-raising and&#13;
protective), it is unlikely that in the maze of rates, anyone really under-&#13;
stands the economic impact of the customs duty system. It may be true that&#13;
the domestic prices of imports are not greatly affected by the existence of&#13;
import duties so that import taxes do not really matter for the time being.&#13;
Yet, a long-term view of the Chinese tax system must assume that, in future,&#13;
domestic prices of imports will be affected by these duties, so that an early&#13;
analysis of their economic impact is warranted.48/&#13;
5. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
5.01      The international review of expenditure and revenue trends during&#13;
the development process has suggested that in most countries, these trends&#13;
follow a pattern when moving from lower-income levels to higher-income levels.&#13;
This pattern appears more cLearly with respect to revenue trends than with&#13;
respect to expenditure trends. Income growth tends to affect the structure of&#13;
the economy which sets the limits or expands the scope for revenue-raising&#13;
efforts.  The responses of budgetary authorities to these structural changes&#13;
and altering scope has been quite similar. Taxation of individual incomes and&#13;
48/ Luc De Wulf (1980) p. 35 concludes that "(1) commodity tax revenue be&#13;
raised by taxes that differentiate between products according to their&#13;
nature rather than their origin; (2) differentiated sales taxes or excise&#13;
taxes rather than customs duties be used to achieve the distributional&#13;
objectives; and (3) tariff protection be coordinated with other policy&#13;
tools to obtain the production-incentive structure considered adequate&#13;
for the various sectors of the economy."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
enterprise profits, and noncascading general commodity taxes became more&#13;
important, while foreign trade taxes lost ground.&#13;
5.02      With expenditure trends, the situation is somewhat different as&#13;
income growth was not found to be a determinant factor in explaining the&#13;
structural difference in expenditures among countries. Demographic and other&#13;
factors were also found to affect greatly the expenditure structure.&#13;
5.03      It is most likely that the factors found to influence the expendi-&#13;
ture and revenue structures in the countries analyzed in this study, will also&#13;
be found to be relevant for China. Whether, and to what extent, these influ-&#13;
ences will actually pattern budgetary policy in China will greatly depend on&#13;
China's response to these influences, a response that will be fashioned by&#13;
China's own economic and political reality. The trends referred to in this&#13;
paper are not to be interpreted as "norms" against which China's own develop-&#13;
ment must be evaluated, or as laws of budgetary development.  Their importance&#13;
resides, rather, in that they show what is "feasible" or "normal" in a statis-&#13;
tical sense. In making medium- and long-term budgetary plans, it would be&#13;
prudent to take into account the various factors that were found to influence&#13;
the budgetary trends, and to verify to what extent the structural and poli-&#13;
tical differences between China and the countries used in the international&#13;
comparisons (mainly market economies) warrant deviation from these trends. In&#13;
this way China could benefit from the experience of other countries while&#13;
taking its own particular situation into account. For instance, as a socialist&#13;
country with several policy instruments in place to avoid the extremes of&#13;
income inequality (for example, wage and price policies, collective or state&#13;
ownership of factors of production), China may put less emphasis on those&#13;
elements of tax policy that make the tax structure progressive (graduated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
individual income taxes, property taxes, and inheritance taxes). Also, the&#13;
taxation of enterprise income will be influenced by the ownership structure of&#13;
the enterprises and, for the time being, by a price structure that causes pro-&#13;
fitability among enterprises to differ greatly. However, economic reforms and&#13;
the gradual development of the economy may lead to freer markets, greater&#13;
differentiation in individual income! and wealth, and the need to grant greater&#13;
operational autonomy to state-owned and collective enterprises. In addition,&#13;
with the price reform gradually taking hold and eventually greater mobility of&#13;
capital prevailing, the price-induced differences in profitability among&#13;
enterprises may gradually diminish. All in all, it is likely that the&#13;
economic structure and policies in China will, over time, move closer to those&#13;
prevailing in other developing countries, at which time the criteria of&#13;
buoyancy, neutrality, predictability, and efficiency that apply in these&#13;
countries will also hold for China. It would be surprising if a convergence&#13;
of the China's tax structure and that prevailing in other developing countries&#13;
were not to emerge. A forward-looking tax reform should anticipate this&#13;
emergence.&#13;

            This study compares China's
            government finance sector with that of other low-income
            countries and draws lessons from the structural differences
            between the public sectors of low- and middle-income
            countries. In light of China's objective to move to a
            middle-income status by the end of the century, and its
            recent progress in implementing economic reforms, such a
            study appears very timely.
