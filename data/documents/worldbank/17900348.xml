            World development indicators 2012 :
            regional highlights
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            These regional highlights present some
            of the key trends in developing countries, drawn from the
            data presented in World Development Indicators 2012, the
            World Bank's annual compilation of relevant,
            high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics
            about development and the quality of people's lives.
            Charts and short narratives highlight the state and progress
            of various development topics such as poverty, health,
            education, the environment, the economy, governance,
            investment, aid, trade, and capital flows. A global review
            of progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is
            presented in the introduction to the world view section of
            World Development Indicators 2012. The high income economies
            are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, but East Asia
            and the Pacific produces the largest share of global carbon
            dioxide emissions among developing regions-more than a
            quarter of total global emissions. As the global economy
            becomes more integrated, air transport is increasingly
            important for delivering not only perishable goods such as
            flowers, but also highly specialized component parts used in
            transnational production networks. Agriculture is a
            declining industry in Europe and Central Asia. The share of
            agriculture in regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell
            from 19 percent to 7 percent over the last two decades.
            People in the developing economies of Europe and Central
            Asia have greater access to commercial bank branches and
            automated teller machines than people in other developing
            regions-about 18 commercial bank branches and 45 ATMs per
            100,000 adults. Governments and citizens in Latin America
            and Caribbean spend more on health care as a share of GDP
            than other developing regions, which is reflected in
            generally good health outcomes. Poverty is falling in the
            Latin America and Caribbean, most notably in Brazil-the most
            populous country in the region. South Asia has the second
            lowest business start-up costs among developing regions.
