         MR. BLACK:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The next item on the agenda is the Operational Report&#13;
&#13;
    covering the period from september 10 to October 7.        Are&#13;
&#13;
J   there any questions on this report?&#13;
         If there are no questions, I would like to calIon Mr.&#13;
    Cargill to supplement the report.&#13;
         MR. CARGILL:       l\lr. Chairman, during the Annual Meeting&#13;
    the Japanese Minister of Finance informed the Bank regarding&#13;
    Japan's program for external borrowing during the next three&#13;
    or four years and suggested projects for Barn, consideration&#13;
    in the fields of pOl.'1er, transportation" and private industry&#13;
    which might involve loans of something like $300 million.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     26 
&#13;
&#13;
He explained that it would not be feasible to find projects&#13;
involving sufficient foreign exchange expenditures to make upl&#13;
this amount and asked the Bank to consider extending loans&#13;
in part for local currency expenditures in order to carry&#13;
out this program.&#13;
&#13;
    The President of the Bank informed the Minister that&#13;
the total external borrowing program proposed by Japan seemed&#13;
reasonable within the limits of their repayment capaCity as&#13;
we now understood the Japanese economic situation, but that&#13;
he did not wish to enter into any understanding about a&#13;
definite program of loans which he was prepared to recommend&#13;
&#13;
to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
     He added that the Bank would be prepared to review parÂ­&#13;
ticular projects which would be submitted for financing to&#13;
see if they were technically and economically sound, and that&#13;
in principle the proposal to finance local currency expendiÂ­&#13;
tures would be acceptable provided that the Bank's financing&#13;
was kept within reasonable proportions of the total expendiÂ­&#13;
tures involved.&#13;
     The Japanese have now asked the Bank to review 11 proÂ­&#13;
jects as the basis for loans under these arrangements.      The&#13;
projects would call for the expansion of four steel plants,&#13;
for the construction of six hydroelectric projects, and for&#13;
a toll road to be built between Kobe and Nagoya.&#13;
    With regard to the steel projects, two of the companies&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             27&#13;
&#13;
have already borro'Vled from the Bank and in the case of one"&#13;
the Kawasaki Steel Corporation" the Bank's knowledge of the&#13;
proposed expansion is sufficient for us to enter into&#13;
negotiations fairly early.      The remaining projects will reÂ­&#13;
quire further examination, probably in Japan.&#13;
    With regard to the six power projects, it has been&#13;
arranged that a technical mission should visit Japan in&#13;
November to commence a study of them.&#13;
     The road project is still in a preliminary stage of&#13;
investigation.     The Government is thinking of financing its&#13;
construction partly by a loan from the Bank and partly by&#13;
a bond issue in the New York market" but final decisions on&#13;
this case can not be taken for some time.&#13;
     MR. BLACK:     Any   questions?&#13;
     Mr. Larre.&#13;
     MR. LARRE:     May I ask whether there is any hint of what&#13;
is the amount that the Japanese Government is looking to&#13;
borrow from the Bank in this?          I donlt think they are going&#13;
to borrow $300 million from the Bank alone.          Is there any&#13;
figure which has been put forward?&#13;
     MR. CARGILL:     That is the figure.&#13;
     MR. BLACK:     That is the figure" $300 million.&#13;
     MR. CARGILL:     Over the next three or four years.&#13;
     MR. LARRE :    That is from the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. CARGILL:     Yes.&#13;
