            The World Bank operations over the past
            seven years have included substantial activities in support
            of private participation in infrastructure (PPI). The author
            shows that, in keeping with its mandate, the Bank has
            focused primarily on policy-related PPI support, for
            example, to establish an appropriate legal and regulatory
            environment and on the least developed regions, especially Africa.
