                  THE   CHAIRftA.N:   Before we begj_n the meeting, I would like&#13;
&#13;
         to extend a welcome to our new Alternate Director from Yugo-&#13;
&#13;
         slavia, Mr. Popovic.          We-are very glad to have you on the i3oard.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Popovic has already been in Washington as Alternate Director&#13;
&#13;
         for tbe Fund.&#13;
&#13;
                  The main purpose of this special meeting is to consider&#13;
&#13;
         the proposed loan of $31Â·5 million to the Indian Iron and Steel&#13;
&#13;
         Company.        You have a report and my recommendations with the&#13;
&#13;
         supporting papers and the draft resolution.            Before calling&#13;
&#13;
         on Dr. Basch who will speak to you about this loan, the repre-&#13;
&#13;
         sentatives are here from the legal and technical departments&#13;
&#13;
         also, as well as Mr. Macurda of the First Boston Corporation&#13;
&#13;
         who went out there on our mission to India.            And they are pre&#13;
&#13;
         pared to answer any other questions that may fall in that&#13;
&#13;
         particular field.&#13;
&#13;
                  So I would first like to call on Dr.        Bas ch.&#13;
&#13;
                  DR. BASCH:     Mr. Chairman, I would like to start my com-&#13;
&#13;
         ments just with brief remarks on the economic and financial&#13;
&#13;
         situation of India which was reviewed in a brief paper called&#13;
         11&#13;
              He cent   Economic and Financial Developments in India. 11       This&#13;
&#13;
         paper refers to a paper of February in which we discuss a&#13;
&#13;
         five-year plan and assess Indian development.It was not the&#13;
                                                                                      I&#13;
         tntention this time to reassess from Washington the new positi~n&#13;
&#13;
         but only to present so far as we know new trends or changes              wh~ch&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              took place in India since our last report.&#13;
&#13;
                      To summarize briefly, there are the following              feat~res&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              which perhaps might be considered.             First, the inflation is a&#13;
&#13;
              result of increased rate of interest, great control and also&#13;
&#13;
              great de      cit in the balance of pa;:rments.        Due to a break in&#13;
&#13;
              the price structure, which brought to light substantial quan-&#13;
&#13;
              tities of hoarded commodities all over India, including grain,&#13;
&#13;
              the price position has changed.             The prices now are below the&#13;
&#13;
              pre-Korea level.          The food situation has changed substantially:--&#13;
                                                                                                  '&#13;
              so much so that most of the imported grain in 1952 went to                      gov~3rn-&#13;
        I'&#13;
        ];    ment stocks and decontrol was possible in various states in&#13;

                 Steel Company, which, beginning January 30, 1953, has to take&#13;
&#13;
                 over all the assets and the liabiliti.es of the Steel Corporat1on&#13;
&#13;
                 of Bengal.     It was provided so by ordinance issued on October 29&#13;
&#13;
                 this year, wh1ch, of' course, has /lapsed becal1se 42 days after-       ll&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 wards it /lapses, but we expect the Pa1~liament now in session&#13;
&#13;
                 will pass a bill similar to this ordinance.     So the project&#13;
&#13;
                 will be carried out by this corpora ti on which has merged. with&#13;
&#13;
                 the other corporation.&#13;
&#13;
                         The objective is to increase production of steel by&#13;
&#13;
                 350,000 tons, production of pig iron for foundrys by 260,000&#13;
&#13;
                 tons.     If we take into consideration the expansion program&#13;
&#13;
                 which is carried out by others, we fj_nd out that by 1957 India&#13;
&#13;
                 will have a steel production of 1.7 million tons, Â·which is the1&#13;
&#13;
                 estimated consl1mption in that year.    Of course, in years afte~-&#13;
                                                                                     1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             1&#13;
&#13;
                 wards it will again fall short because consumption will expandl&#13;
                                                                                     I&#13;
                 and there will be need for further increased production of&#13;
&#13;
                 steel.&#13;
&#13;
                         Now, details of the project are described on pages 3, 4,&#13;
&#13;
                 5 and 6 of the technical report.     Also, the market is analyzed&#13;
&#13;
                 and there is no doubt that the increased production will fine_&#13;
&#13;
                 market in India      and the report reminds that should that not&#13;
&#13;
                 be the case, India,being one of the lowest producers of iron&#13;
&#13;
        I and steel, should find export possibilities for its pig iron&#13;
        !1&#13;
        li&#13;
                 or for its steel.    But at the moment, the danger' or such&#13;
        11&#13;
        I&#13;

          11     matured in 1966,and also as part of the trade we agreed to&#13;
          11&#13;

          Ii accelernte the maturity of those bonds to 1961, so that the&#13;

          11          The first proposal that we made was that we merely give                   I&#13;
                 the holders a 21.75 percent bond or increase the interest rate&#13;
          !&#13;
                 to 4.75 from 4 percent and leave the matl1rity as it was.                 It   I&#13;
          I&#13;
          I      looked as if tAa:t j_;: holders of those bonds were suddenly c;ivel                JJC.&#13;
          I&#13;
                 a new bond bearing lJ.â&#128;¢ 75 percent as compared to the old bond                 I&#13;
          11&#13;

&#13;
          i bearing 4 percent, that the bonds would be worth more money.        I&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;

                 However, the market interpretation was such that when tm t was I&#13;
&#13;
                 announced, the bonds went down in price.        It was because it 1raJ&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;

          they had formerlyj                 so the market interpretation was that this&#13;

            This partial transcript, from the
            session of the Executive Directors held on Wednesday,
            December 17, 1952, covers only a proposed loan to India for
            the Indian Iron and Steel Company and Steel Corporation of
            Bengal Project. The discussion began with an overview of the
            economic and financial situation in India. It also covered
            the contribution of steel factories and mills to the
            Equalization Fund, the shareholders' part in the
            financing of an improvement in assets, and the commitment
            charge in dollars although the loan may be spent in other
            currencies. The Executive Directors resolved to approve the loan.
