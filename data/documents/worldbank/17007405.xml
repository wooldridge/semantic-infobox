&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A&#13;
        ll countries face a growing funding gap as they try to keep up with the reha-&#13;
        bilitation, operation, and maintenance of aging water infrastructures. New&#13;
        water systems must also be built to cope with growing populations, shift-&#13;
ing consumption patterns, and a changing climate. In developing countries,1 pub-&#13;
lic and private investment has not kept up with demand for water infrastructure,&#13;
which increases costs in the long-run. The financial crisis threatens to bring even&#13;
more uncertainty to an already underfunded sector with inherently low capacity to&#13;
attract investment.  &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Private investors prefer to work in middle-income countries where the risk is lower, leaving the&#13;
poorest countries dependent on volatile public budgets and donor commitments. An estimated 75&#13;
percent of water investment in developing countries comes from public sources. Slower growth and&#13;
lower tax revenues imply that donor commitments, public budgets, and household contributions are&#13;
at risk of diminishing. As a result, the resources available must be maximized through reforms.&#13;
     The overarching goal of water sector reform is to promote sustainable service delivery by incre-&#13;
mentally moving the burden of infrastructure finance from the public sector to shared investment by&#13;
the public and private sector.  Under a national reform strategy, all stakeholders should participate&#13;
in the reform cycle by adjusting their performance, and each will start at a different point in the cycle&#13;
commensurate with existing challenges and capacities. Successful reform depends on strong leader-&#13;
ship to coordinate a series of sometimes parallel and sometimes sequenced transformations.&#13;
     Most countries can improve their financial control and ability to weather the current financial cli-&#13;
mate by helping utilities to move toward cost recovery and by improving public spending. From target-&#13;
ed subsidies to risk pooling and guarantees, public contributions lay the groundwork for sustainable&#13;
water service delivery. Improving the way public funds are allocated and transferred will help gov-&#13;
ernments leverage private finance in the long run. When supported by sound governance frame-&#13;
works, these contributions can foster mutually beneficial partnerships between the public and private&#13;
spheres that can help fill the financing gap. Public Expenditure Reviews and Results Based Financing&#13;

      his paper provides background information for development practitioners&#13;
      in the water and other infrastructure sectors. It outlines the major challeng-&#13;
      es related to financing the gap in global water infrastructure, including those&#13;
systems that provide urban and rural water supply, and sanitation and irrigation&#13;
services. Water infrastructure finance includes costs for capital works as well as&#13;
the operations and maintenance costs that motivate sustainable service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The paper seeks to synthesize the extensive body of literature on this subject into a broad over-&#13;
view, providing some examples of the historical trends in financing, and taking lessons learned from&#13;
developed to developing countries. Most of the published literature on this topic emphasizes the need&#13;
for additional financial resources to respond to increasing demand for services. Furthermore, the stud-&#13;
ies are limited primarily to the water supply and sanitation sector and rely heavily on illustrating means&#13;
of increasing private sector participation and private financing. In contrast, this paper defines new&#13;
challenges in the wake of the recent global financial crisis and provides insight into improving the effi-&#13;
cacy of water supply, sanitation, and irrigation infrastructure finance from public and private sources.&#13;
    Given that in developing countries around 75 percent of investments in water are from public re-&#13;
sources (loans, grants, technical assistance), this paper emphasizes the importance of efficiencies in&#13;
the investment and monitoring of public spending. In many instances, additional financial resources&#13;
will not necessarily result in increased access and better services, but efficiency improvements will re-&#13;
duce overall financing needs; a crucial factor in this era of financial insecurity.&#13;
    Section 1 introduces the linkages between water infrastructure and growing global challenges, in-&#13;
cluding food and energy security as well as climate change. Section 2 describes investment needs in&#13;
the sector and details various traditional funding sources. Section 3 proposes a 5 step reform cycle&#13;
for making better use of limited funding in the sector. Tools for making these improvements are out-&#13;
lined in Section 4. The paper concludes with Section 5, a summary of the challenges and recommen-&#13;
dations for the way forward.&#13;
    A summary version of this paper was published in the 4th edition of the UN World Water&#13;
Development Report (WWDR4) in 2012.&#13;

                   Water in an Uncertain World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A&#13;
       dequate and well-maintained water infrastructure is a necessary condition&#13;
       for economic growth and poverty reduction. From water supply and sani-&#13;
       tation to irrigation, flood control and hydropower, investments in water in-&#13;
frastructure need to keep up with global demand. New systems must be built for&#13;
growing and urbanizing populations, changing consumption and income patterns,&#13;
and food and energy security demands. At the same time, deteriorating structures&#13;
require rehabilitation just to maintain current levels of service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Research shows that limited access to infrastructure, including those that provide water and energy&#13;
services, has substantial implications for the poor, ranging from ill health to child mortality (Fay et al.&#13;
2005). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 85 and 90 percent of diarrheal&#13;
diseases in the developing world are caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation, and a lack of hygiene ed-&#13;
ucation (Pruss-Ustun et al. 2002). Women and girls benefit immensely from well-sustained water sup-&#13;
ply and sanitation services. For example, the provision of latrines in schools increases the enrollment&#13;
of girls, and improvements in safe water sources frees women from spending hours every day drawing&#13;
and carrying water home (WaterAid 2005). Thus, the Millennium Developments Goals (MDGs), with&#13;
their emphasis on safe water, remain cornerstones of human and economic development.&#13;
    Between 1990 and 2010 more than 2 billion people gained access to improved sources of drink-&#13;
ing water, making drinking water one of the first MDG targets to be met. However, progress towards&#13;
reaching the sanitation target has been discouraging. Though the number of people with access to im-&#13;
proved sanitation rose from 43 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 2010, in many developing countries,&#13;
especially those in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, it has only reached 30 or 40 percent (UNICEF&#13;
and WHO 2012).&#13;
    Halving by 2015 the number of people without access to improved drinking water and sanitation is&#13;
a necessary condition for reaching other targets, including poverty reduction. Furthermore, providing&#13;
the right quantity and quality of water for food and energy production will promote economic growth&#13;
and stability. As a critical input in production and in services, water is directly affected by the current&#13;
global financial, energy, and food crises (Winpenny et al. 2009).&#13;

          The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Access to Improved Water Supply&#13;
  Box 1:â&#128;&#130; &amp;#7;&#13;
          Sources: Three Alternative Scenarios&#13;
&#13;
  The Global Monitoring Report 2010 created three possible scenarios to analyze the effects that the financial crisis&#13;
  would have on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries: the post-crisis trend, the pre-crisis (high&#13;
  growth) trend and the low growth scenario. These were used in projecting the percentage of the population in develop-&#13;
  ing countries who would not have access to improved water sources.&#13;
       The post-crisis scenario shows the effects on GDP assuming a relatively rapid economic recovery starting in 2010.&#13;
  This is the reportâ&#128;&#153;s base case forecast.&#13;
       The pre-crisis (high growth) scenario shows what the effects on GDP would have been had developing countries&#13;
  continued the impressive growth pattern that occurred between 2000 and 2007. The impact that the crisis had on the&#13;
  MDGs can thus be measured by comparing the post-crisis trend with the pre-crisis trend.&#13;
       The low growth scenario assumes that the things that got worse because of the financial crisis will continue to ad-&#13;
  versely affect GDP in the medium term, resulting in little or no growth for about five years, followed by a slow recovery.&#13;

W&#13;
          ater services provide important economic, health, and environmental&#13;
          benefits but are severely underfunded on a global scale. Funding sourc-&#13;
          es, from private investment to utility revenues and public expenditures,&#13;
have been inadequate to meet past needs and are becoming scarcer as a result of&#13;
the financial crisis. Nevertheless, investment needs in the sector are large and in-&#13;
creasing alongside population growth and urbanization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The financing gap for water, sanitation, and irrigation infrastructure is difficult to estimate, but ap-&#13;
proximating future costs will help countries and donors activate more funding and help financiers un-&#13;
derstand the potential market for private investment.&#13;
    Fay et al. (2010) asserts that a thorough analysis of investment needs requires four distinct steps:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1.	 Understand how much is being spent and how that relates to current quantity and quality of&#13;
       infrastructure.&#13;
    2.	 Set a target and have it priced. The infrastructure gap is the difference between current spend-&#13;
       ing and the target.&#13;
    3.	 Determine how much of the gap can be bridged through improved efficiency.&#13;
    4.	 Look at the balance to see the needed additional spending (financing gap).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There are difficulties in each of the four steps. Countries and financial institutions do not account&#13;
for infrastructure investment in a clear way in national accounts, and inefficiencies in the system are&#13;
difficult to estimate. Much more information is available on recent capital expenditures than on exist-&#13;
ing infrastructure stocks. This paper uses estimates from a variety of data sources, and focuses on in-&#13;
formation related to sub-Saharan Africa, which is a priority region for water infrastructure finance and&#13;
for which recent data and analysis is available.&#13;

                                                       Financing the Gap&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D&#13;
        eveloping countries need to invest around $103 billion a year to meet sector&#13;
        demands in WSS, on top of the estimated $15 billion needed for climate change&#13;
        adaptation measures. The financial crisis has reduced the amount of money&#13;
available from both private and public sources and may continue to do so. Countries&#13;
need to make use of all available resources through more efficient and effective com-&#13;
binations of funding. Each stakeholder, from service providers to regulators and cen-&#13;
tral governments, has a role to play in securing long-term sector finance. Each should&#13;
bring its contributions to the table to leverage the resources of the others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Barriers to Sector Finance&#13;
&#13;
In an ideal world, service providers would recover their costs and remain in a healthy financial posi-&#13;
tion to provide sustainable services in the long run. This would be done by attracting capital from the&#13;
private sector to make needed investments, and generating sufficient revenue from users to service&#13;
loans and pay recurring costs.&#13;
    In reality, this rarely happens because the water sector faces several inherent challenges that re-&#13;
strain private investment in its infrastructure and services. Potential investors perceive many risks in&#13;
the delivery of water supply, sanitation and irrigation services. First, water is a politicized commodity&#13;
that is considered a public good on one hand and a high-value economic input on the other. To reach&#13;
health, economic, poverty or other goals, governments could change water policies and plans at any&#13;
given moment. Future water policies (whether wastewater has to be treated or drinking water has to&#13;
be paid for) are uncertain, and tariff levels are subject to political interference.&#13;
    Second, many utilities in developing countries have sub-par operational management. For example,&#13;
assets are not inventoried, the location of pipe networks is not fully known, and the current and future&#13;
customer base is undocumented. This makes it very difficult to estimate costs and revenues or design&#13;
long-term business plans. Given the lack of information and the potential lack of control over price set-&#13;
ting, local governments and providers do not have credit ratings that investors can use to estimate risk.&#13;
    Finally, most water infrastructure is built for a service period of around 20 years. This means that&#13;
the upfront costs are large and the repayment periods are long, making them unfavorable to com-&#13;
mercial lenders. Thus, even when trying to attract finance on a project basis, providers have difficulty&#13;

         Reducing Non-Revenue Water in Brazil&#13;
 Box 2:â&#128;&#130; &amp;#7;&#13;
&#13;
 Inaccurate metering, unauthorized consumption, and leakages all result in non-revenue water. NRW reductions should&#13;
 be considered within the broader context of utility reform in order to ensure that appropriate funds and resources are&#13;
 allocated. The full scope of the problem should be identified at the onset by characterizing the sources of NRW through&#13;
 a baseline assessment.&#13;
      The private sector has much to offer in devising and implementing solutions for different NRW challenges. Private&#13;
 players can develop new technology and provide investments and incentives for project performance. Options range&#13;
 from delegated management under public private partnership (PPP) contracts, to technical assistance contracts and&#13;
 outsourcing of key utility functions to improve performance.&#13;
      Under a performance-based services contract, a private firmâ&#128;&#153;s remuneration is based on enforced operational&#13;
 performance measures. This strategy was adopted by the Companhia de Saneamento BÃ¡sico do SÃ£o Paulo (SABEP),&#13;
 the water utility that serves the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region in Brazil. The private contractor assisted the utility in&#13;
 improving the production and delivery of water through activities such as better micro metering. This increased reve-&#13;
 nues and reduced the debt load. The outcome of the 3-year contract led to an increase in total volume of metered con-&#13;
 sumption by 45 million m3 and a revenue increase of $72 million.&#13;

 Box 3:â&#128;&#130; Water User Associations: An Essential Component to Improving Cost Recovery&#13;
         in Irrigation Systems in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
&#13;
 An on-farm irrigation project was implemented from 2000 to 2008 in seven administrative regions of the Kyrgyz&#13;
 Republic. The project was aimed at increasing crop production through reliable and sustainable water distribution.&#13;
 On-farm infrastructure was also rehabilitated under the management of water user associations (WUAs).&#13;
      Members from each participating WUA signed an agreement to repay 25 percent of the on-farm rehabilitation&#13;
 costs, raise irrigation fees to support the operation and maintenance activities of their associations, and pay the wa-&#13;
 ter supplier an irrigation service fee for water delivered to the WUAâ&#128;&#153;s head gate. Considerable success was achieved:&#13;

     â&#128;¢	    Performance of targeted WUAs (166,000 members), managing about 710,000 hectares (70 percent) of the&#13;

     â&#128;¢	    Infrastructure that fed 120,000 hectares was rehabilitated, and water delivery to farmers in 80 percent of the&#13;

     â&#128;¢	    Three agricultural seasons later, irrigation service fees had doubled on average and collection rates by WUAs&#13;
           amounted to close to 100 percent of total assessed fees.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	    Overall cost recovery for operation and maintenance increased from about 20 percent to 60 percent and at&#13;

Box 4:â&#128;&#130; The Cost of Agricultural Water Demand&#13;
&#13;
The 2009 report, Charting our Water Future: Economic frameworks to inform decision-making, is a study carried out by&#13;
the 2030 Water Resources Group and led by the International Finance Corporation and McKinsey &amp; Company. It pro-&#13;
vides an evaluation of the scale of the water challenge, estimating that by 2030, global water requirements may grow&#13;
by over 40 percent from 4,500 billion m3 to 6,900 billion m3.&#13;
      Demand for agricultural water, which currently accounts for 71 percent of water used, is expected to rise from&#13;
3,100 billion m3 to 4,500 billion m3 by 2030. In percentage terms, this will be a slight drop (to 65 percent of 2020 global&#13;
water withdrawals), but water for agriculture remains a major challenge. Agricultural demand is projected to be most&#13;
significant in the poorest regions, such as India (1,195 billion m3), sub-Saharan Africa (820 billion m3), and China (420&#13;
billion m3).&#13;
      Closing the water supplyâ&#128;&#147;demand gap has financial implications. According to the report, the cost of closing the&#13;
2030 gap will range from $0.10/m3 to over $0.50/m3. Without a new, balanced approach, these figures call for an ad-&#13;
ditional annual investment in upstream water infrastructure of up to $200 billion, which is more than four times cur-&#13;
rent expenditure.&#13;

sult of the intervention, and the height shows the cost per cubic meter. The least cost options (on the left side of the&#13;
graph) comprise demand-side efficiencies in irrigation. Existing technologies, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation, can&#13;
be used to save water, so that the more expensive supply-side interventions (building treatment systems and dams)&#13;
are not needed. The cost curve for China, on the other hand, demonstrates how industrial water use efficiencies can&#13;
save significant resources at little cost. Each country has to find the appropriate mix of interventions to fund the gap.&#13;

    Box 5:â&#128;&#130; European Union Water Framework Directive on Water Pricing&#13;
&#13;
    Article 9 of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) required member states to adopt water pricing pol-&#13;
    icies by 2010 that provided adequate incentives for efficient use of water resources. Water service costs include envi-&#13;
    ronmental costs, and are based on the polluter pays principle whether that user is industry, agriculture or households.&#13;
    The principle aims to mitigate environmental problems through reliance on economic efficiency.&#13;
         The WFDâ&#128;&#153;s concept of cost recovery includes two levels: 1) financial; and 2) environmental and resource costs.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢	    Financial costs (the full cost of supply): This includes the costs of providing and administering water servic-&#13;
              es. It includes all operation and maintenance costs as well as capital costs.&#13;
        â&#128;¢	    Resource costs: These represent opportunities lost to other uses as a result of the depletion of the resource&#13;
              beyond its natural rate of recovery (for example, losses linked to the over-abstraction of groundwater).&#13;
        â&#128;¢	    Environmental costs: These refer to the costs of damage that water use imposes on the environment and&#13;
              ecosystems (for example, aquatic ecosystems can be damaged).&#13;

  Box 6:â&#128;&#130; Changes in Management Structure Lead Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s Sector Reform&#13;
&#13;
  The National Water and Sanitation Corporation (NWSC) of Uganda, which supplies water and provides sewerage ser-&#13;
  vices in urban areas, enhanced its financial performance through a series of efficiency improvements. Top-down&#13;
  sector reforms enabled private sector participation in operations and fostered a more commercially-oriented environ-&#13;
  ment at the public utility. In response, NWSC made internal changes to its management structure by providing super-&#13;
  visors with the autonomy they needed to staff positions and allocate other resources. Managers could earn bonus pay&#13;
  for increasing operating income and meeting other performance targets. The number of employees was subsequent-&#13;
  ly reduced from 24 people per 1,000 connections to 10 people per 1,000 connections. NWSC expanded service by 33&#13;
  percent and improved billing and collections ratios. Moreover, a new culture focused on customer relations improved&#13;
  customer complaint response times and connection speeds. As a result, revenues jumped from 23.7 billion Uganda&#13;
  shillings in 2000 to 40.9 billion just four years later.&#13;

  Box 7:â&#128;&#130; The Philippines Water Revolving Fund: The Reform Cycle in Action&#13;
&#13;
  Much of the water supply in the Philippines is delivered by more than 6,000 small utilities, each with their own finan-&#13;
  cial and operational challenges. The country is currently undergoing major water sector reform to include operational,&#13;
  financial, and regulatory changes toward meeting the MDGs for water supply and sanitation. The cornerstone of the&#13;
  process is the Philippine Water Revolving Fund (PWRF), created in response to a 2004 executive order whereby water&#13;
  utilities were mandated to move from government to market-based financing.&#13;
        The PWRF works from both sides of the challenge, helping potential investors understand water utility business&#13;
  models and assess risk, and helping local governments gain access to private capital. The PWRF acts as a financial in-&#13;
  termediary through which private creditors lend 25â&#128;&#147;50 percent of a loan, and public and ODA contributions make up&#13;
  the remainder. The creditor applies for a guarantee from a private domestic corporation. The funds are on-lent to local&#13;
  utilities through the Development Bank of the Philippines, usually with a 20-year repayment period.&#13;
        In addition to financial brokering, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s water reform encompasses a host of institutional, regulatory, and&#13;
  technical strengthening measures. For example, utility managers receive training in investment planning and market&#13;
  forecasting to produce viable business plans that can be proposed to private lenders. The reform has also included&#13;
  assistance to develop bankable projects for water supply and septage management projects, starting with feasibili-&#13;
  ty studies.&#13;

       his section suggests the use of two tools that can help sector stakeholders&#13;
       enter into the reform cycle. The first is Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), a&#13;
       sector-level analysis that has proven instrumental in showing governments&#13;
where their money ends up and the bottlenecks that need to be removed to im-&#13;
prove efficiency and effectiveness in spending. Evidence from recent PERs in the&#13;
water sector has shown that annual budgets are rarely part of long-term sector&#13;
strategies and, thus, do not reflect policy objectives. This creates a â&#128;&#156;disconnect&#13;
between expenditure and outputsâ&#128;? (Van Ginneken et al. 2011). The second tool, the&#13;
incorporation of results-based financing in water investments, seeks to address&#13;
this challenge. This instrument can be used by donors to provide incentives for&#13;
achieving project outcomes, or by governments to ensure long-run sustainability&#13;
of outputs in contracting with public or private operators.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs)&#13;
&#13;
Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) help a country compare how the flow and use of public funds to&#13;
the water sector stacks up against budgets. A PER is concerned with public-based (not always gov-&#13;
ernment) revenues and expenditures as expressions of public policy and public involvement in the&#13;
economy (World Bank 2009). It entails a careful examination and analysis at the country level of the&#13;
fundamental drivers of public finance. The recommendations provide guidance to governments on&#13;
critical reform processes that can be taken to ensure efficiency, efficacy, and transparency in the use&#13;
of public monies flowing to the water sector.&#13;
    Pradhan (1996) provides a summary of the main elements of a PER, which include discussion and&#13;
analysis of aggregate public spending in the sector and its allocation; whether public expenditure com-&#13;
plements or substitutes for private activities; the impacts that public programs have had on the poor;&#13;
allocations for capital and recurrent expenditure; and budgetary institutions and processes, and their&#13;
role in promoting fiscal discipline, allocative and technical efficiency, and equity.&#13;

        ture will be needed for countries to achieve their development goals, from&#13;
        human health to food security, to energy security and climate resilience.&#13;
While data on current water infrastructure stocks and sector financing is sparse,&#13;
estimates of needed investment for developing countries are around $100 million&#13;
per year. To pay for this infrastructure, developing countries will face serious ob-&#13;
stacles, including low levels of government support and an inability to attract pri-&#13;
vate finance. The recent financial crisis has made financing the gap in global water&#13;
infrastructure even more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
    All water sector stakeholders can contribute to reforms that help close this gap. Service provid-&#13;
ers can improve performance and maintain accountability to customers. Governments and donors&#13;
can stretch their dollars and collaborate to reduce risks for potential private sector investors. The wa-&#13;
ter reform strategy in the Philippines provides an example of how each stakeholder can make its con-&#13;
tribution to the reform process, helping to bridge the space between what the public needs and what&#13;
private investors can provide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Service Providers&#13;
&#13;
All stakeholders should focus on helping service providers achieve financial sustainability by improv-&#13;
ing cost recovery and public expenditure. Cost recovery that enables private investment is the optimal&#13;
strategy for service providers to pay for current and future water infrastructure. However, it is political-&#13;
ly difficult to implement even in developed countries, like the United States. Recovering the full cost of&#13;
delivering water services is complex. Reconciling the economic and financial objectives of cost recov-&#13;
ery is hard enough, and this is exacerbated by considerations of environmental sustainability and social&#13;
affordability. The mechanisms and instruments designed to manage these different objectives deter-&#13;
mine the role that tariffs and user charges can play, which will differ from water service to water service.&#13;
    Service providers can partially close the gap by lowering costs and making efficiency gains. Such&#13;
efficiencies, even in the absence of full cost recovery, will improve the ability of utilities to adapt to&#13;

            Investing in water infrastructure :
            capital, operations, and maintenance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper provides background
            information for development practitioners in the water and
            other infrastructure sectors. It outlines the major
            challenges related to financing the gap in global water
            infrastructure, including those systems that provide urban
            and rural water supply, and sanitation and irrigation
            services. Water infrastructure finance includes costs for
            capital works as well as the operations and maintenance
            costs that motivate sustainable service delivery. Section
            one introduces the linkages between water infrastructure and
            growing global challenges, including food and energy
            security as well as climate change. Section two describes
            investment needs in the sector and details various
            traditional funding sources. Section three proposes a five
            step reform cycle for making better use of limited funding
            in the sector. Tools for making these improvements are
            outlined in section four. The paper concludes with section
            five, a summary of the challenges and recommendations for
            the way forward.
