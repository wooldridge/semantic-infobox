            causes and consequences
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This Note examines the opportunities for
            illicit gain that exist in all countries.  It asks what
            factors determine the size and incidence of bribe payments
            and assesses the political, economic, and distributive
            consequences of corruption.  Bribes are paid for two
            reasons--to obtain government benefits and to avoid costs.
            There is little evidence on how often officials, private
            firms, and individuals take advantage of corrupt
            opportunities and on how much money is paid in bribes.
            Surveys suggest that where corruption is endemic, it imposes
            a disproportionately high burden on the smallest firm.  But,
            importantly, the most severe costs are often not the bribes
            themselves, but the underlying distortions they reveal.
            Despite the costs of widespread corruption, they are a
            symptom of disease, not the disease itself.  Eliminating
            corruption makes no sense if the result is a rigid,
            unresponsive, autocratic government.  Instead,
            anticorruption strategies should seek to improve the
            efficiency and fairness of government and to enhance the
            efficiency of the private sector.
