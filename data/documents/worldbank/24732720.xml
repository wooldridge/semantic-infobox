COLLABDRATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Intrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;

ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   JAPAN BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, herein represented by its Goverr cr d&#13;
Chief Executive Officer and he adquartered at 4-1 Ohtemachi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 1:)&#13;
8144, Japan ("JBIC"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPM EN&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), head juartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US \le&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvan =&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("M GA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC : C 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interi Eli. nal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin Ir .he&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed to :::r, nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic rrc vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on ! i! ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coor in :ed&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize private sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects anor is&#13;
understood to be the greatesi barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investmir t&#13;
(D) Governments, development f nance institutions, donors, and private investors share an inl =_t in&#13;
developing the market for pr vate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand : d: in&#13;
the numbers of structurally scund and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em( r:l: ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a *ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of  ate&#13;
investors that actively partici ate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will te efit&#13;
from collective action betwenn this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl[( c to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  infrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  institutioi Ic uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure F;a ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera( inic the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct irt vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep .2 on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, he  31F&#13;
aims to complement existin( and proposed services and initiatives currently supported 1)' the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepE re ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure pro ects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces! ii n(i the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro! re( tive&#13;
private sector financiers into )roject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater i!\ e age&#13;
of official resources in the fa;e of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular f.':. rge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure FE ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliff inary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the CIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pl:&gt; e ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati ir,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial a n,&#13;
institutional investor engagerr ent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publl:-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer:i&#13;
viability which require project oreparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru :t.i&#13;
financing solutions that no sirgle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF z ims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ra :n&#13;
resources in collaboration wit i the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th . le&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD&#13;
infrastructure, with the input End ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemei tc uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowrstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemer t.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure:&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GI can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset clas attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long t: i&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opp )rtunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile &#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to ooerate according to the following core principles, to be finalize cu )on&#13;

leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- 1n&#13;
as through Public -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's ser 'ice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastrLcture investments that have global public good characteristic , ch&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision f&#13;
infrastructure services; and tride enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne( tillif&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppo t provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with : v w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and otl E *&#13;
funding mechanisms. During ,he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac i'i s,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition 3nd enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; proj  ct definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr E ig;&#13;
and legal, regulatbry, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparatic n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PF P structuring;&#13;

transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arranging and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi,111&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-i icluding in particular the management of environmental and oc il&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri clu e&#13;
projects in supporting sustain able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, "eputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements,: -&#13;
external implementing entitie! under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc (t 3r&#13;
standards and policies, and cevelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI:&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
