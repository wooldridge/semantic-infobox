                   GDP growth anchored at seven percent,                      with suppliers and pension funds, which&#13;
                   inflation in the range of six percent, and a               reached almost five percent of GDP at end-&#13;
                   much improved current account balance,                     March 2014.&#13;
                   the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy has outperformed&#13;
                   those of many other developing and                         Although fiscal developments warrant&#13;
                   industrialized countries.                                  concern, recent history reminds us that&#13;
                                                                              Tanzanian policymakers have been able&#13;
                   However, some clouds have recently                         to navigate through stormy skies before,&#13;
                   appeared on the horizon. In 2013 Tanzania                  notably during the agitated times of&#13;
                   reported its weakest export growth since                   the global financial crisis in 2008/9.&#13;
                   the late 1990s. While this slowdown is                     Nonetheless, the stakes are high this time&#13;
                   principally the result of lower commodity                  around because public debt and debt-&#13;
                   prices on international markets (particularly              service payments have increased rapidly,&#13;
                   gold), it is a stark reminder that Tanzania                while the fiscal space has been reduced,&#13;
                   remains vulnerable to external shocks.                     forcing expenditure adjustments. This&#13;
                   Of greater concern is the deterioration                    is taking place not too long before the&#13;
                   of the overall fiscal deficit which reached                November 2015 national elections, which&#13;
                   6.8 percent of GDP â&#128;&#147; one percent higher                    may limit the scope for fiscal adjustment.&#13;
                   than initially targeted in 2012/13. Over the&#13;
                   first three quarters of the current year, the              This fifth economic update also examines&#13;
                   fiscal situation has remained fragile. The                 prospects for economic prosperity in the&#13;
                   ambitious revenue targets were missed                      context of rapid urbanization; in particular,&#13;

&amp;#12;       Part I: The State of the Economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ In 2013, the Tanzanian economy followed the same positive trajectory as in recent&#13;
           years, growing at a rate of about seven percent and with inflation leveling at six&#13;
           percent. Despite the fact that exports recorded their worst performance in the past&#13;
           10 years, the balance of payments improved slightly during the year, with higher&#13;
           private capital inflows compensating for the deterioration in the trade balance.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ However, the overall fiscal deficit reached a value equivalent to 6.8 percent of GDP&#13;
           in 2012/13, which is 1.3 percentage points higher than initially targeted by the&#13;
           authorities. This deterioration is explained by lower than envisaged levels of revenue&#13;
           collection and a relatively high level of recurrent expenditures rather than by an&#13;
           increase in development spending. A large proportion of the deficit was financed by&#13;
           public non-concessional borrowing and through the accumulation of arrears with&#13;
           contractors and pension funds.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ Looking to the future, no major changes are expected in Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s growth path,&#13;
           so long as the Government successfully implements measures to consolidate the&#13;
           deficit at around 4.5-5.0 percent of GDP. The authorities must strive to improve&#13;
           revenue collection, an area in which poor performance has been recorded over the&#13;
           past two years. The authorities must also control current expenditures to provide&#13;
           fiscal space for their ambitious public investment programs and to maintain fiscal&#13;
           and debt sustainability over time.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ Despite Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s good macroeconomic performance over the past decade, it has&#13;
           been unable to generate a sufficient number of productive jobs providing decent&#13;
           salaries. Unique opportunities can however, be seen in the agglomeration effects&#13;
           of the ongoing rapid urbanization for firms to develop and create productive jobs,&#13;
           which in turn will stimulate economic growth through productivity gains and higher&#13;
           demand for local products.&#13;

          PPPs. Some of these crucial projects                development of the natural gas industry&#13;
          include the reconstruction of the port of           should also drive growth, although this&#13;
          Dar es Salaam, the rehabilitation of the            impact is unlikely to be significant before&#13;
          railways on the central corridor, and the           2016 (see Box 2).&#13;
                   Box 2: The potential impact of natural gas on Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s domestic businesses&#13;
&#13;
             The recent discoveries of massive offshore reserves of natural gas in the south of&#13;
             Tanzania have the potential to have a radical impact on the nationâ&#128;&#153;s economy. While&#13;
             final decisions are still to be made, there are three main gas companies involved in&#13;
             deep water exploration in Tanzania (British Gas, Statoil and ExxonMobil) and these&#13;
             are projected to invest US$20-25 billion over the next 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
             However, it is important to maintain realistic expectations regarding the impact of&#13;
             these investments on local development and direct job creation. First, the exploitation&#13;
             of natural gas and the fiscal revenues derived are not expected to flow before 2022-&#13;
             2023. Second, the natural gas industry is not labor-intensive and is expected to&#13;
             create only 300 to 500 direct jobs in the operational phase. Third, the needs of the&#13;
             gas industry in terms of skills are very specific. While unskilled and low skilled jobs&#13;
             will be created, many positions will require particular skills that are currently difficult&#13;
             to find in Tanzania. Industry standards governing matters such as health and safety            The development&#13;
             are often high, so training will have to be provided to enable Tanzanians to become            of the natural gas&#13;
             employable in the industry.                                                                    industry should&#13;
                                                                                                            also drive growth,&#13;
             Local private sector growth, and therefore job creation, may occur through the                 although this&#13;
                                                                                                            impact is unlikely to&#13;
             development of two types of linkages:&#13;
                                                                                                            be significant before&#13;
             (1) Up/midstream linkages: Judging from international experience with other projects&#13;
                                                                                                            2016.&#13;
             of this magnitude, the LNG plant construction should generate between 8,000 and&#13;
             10,000 direct jobs over a period of four to six years, starting in 2016 when final&#13;
             investment decisions will be made. These jobs will involve a variety of skill levels and&#13;
             activities related to gas infrastructure development. More importantly, the investment&#13;
             will also be likely to create new demand for supporting and related economic&#13;
             activities, including construction, food production, and business services. Thus, the&#13;
             exploitation of natural gas will create a significant amount of indirect employment,&#13;
             potentially in the range of 20,000 to 35,000 jobs. Although the number of indirect&#13;
             jobs will drop significantly once the construction phase is over, a well-thought out&#13;
             strategy will minimize the impact of this by connecting these jobs to other sectors&#13;
             and by improving the competitiveness of the local private sector to increase their&#13;
             market nationally, regionally and internationally.&#13;

                                (2) Downstream linkages: The availability of additional natural gas in the domestic&#13;
                                market creates an opportunity to attract and develop energy intensive industries,&#13;
                                such as cement and fertilizer production. If sufficient incentives for investors are&#13;
                                put in place, including fair pricing systems, reliability of access to gas, and ease of&#13;
                                doing business, several industries that use gas as a feedstock could decide to set up&#13;
                                operations in the country. In turn, this would create more job opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
                                In addition to these two types of linkages, the gas industry will also result in the&#13;
         The rate of            development of new infrastructure such as ports, which, if strategically planned,&#13;
         inflation is           could be used to create and boost other economic activities, including through the&#13;

&#13;
              Over the past few years, the fiscal situation has significantly deteriorated in Ghana&#13;
              through a combination of political expenses and borrowing against current and future&#13;
              oil revenues. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit increased from 4.3 percent of GDP in&#13;
              2011 to 11.8 percent of GDP in 2012, despite a 2012 target of 6.7 percent.&#13;

              Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal overspend has led to a significant increase in debt service payments,&#13;
                                                                                                                              In other words,&#13;

          it is possible to envisage two scenarios.                    20 percent of projected domestic revenues&#13;
          The first scenario assumes that the overall                  by 2020, or almost six percent above the&#13;
          deficit level will remain at its 2012/13                     baseline scenario (see Figure 16). The&#13;
          level (where the primary balance is 3.6                      ratio between net present value debt and&#13;
          percent of GDP) for the period from                          GDP will also increase, exceeding the 50&#13;
          2013/14 to 2020/21, while the second                         percent threshold by 2021 (see Figure&#13;
          supposes that the adjustment will take                       17). In other words, Tanzania would no&#13;

          scenario, obviously extreme, shows that                      country and a significant proportion of&#13;
          the Government will run into problems                        public resources would need to be used to&#13;
          long before it derives revenues from the                     service the debt.&#13;

              	 The overall deficit is maintained to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2013/14 and 2014/15, and is brought down to 5&#13;
                percent of GDP in 2015/16 and 4.5 percent subsequently. A primary balance of 3.6 percent is equivalent to a&#13;
                fiscal deficit of 6.8 percent.&#13;

                         If the urbanization process is managed well, tremendous benefits can be captured from&#13;
                         the agglomeration effects. And given the importance of Dar es Salaam for the national&#13;
                         and regional economy, it is critical to change current urban development trends. However,&#13;
                         Dar es Salaam has fundamental barriers limiting the quality and potential of its future&#13;
                         development. These include backlogs in infrastructure investments; underperforming&#13;
                         own-source revenue collection systems; the mushrooming of informal settlements;&#13;
                         sprawling energy intensive settlement patterns; the absence of effective metropolitan&#13;
                         planning and governance arrangements; and capacity constraints for management and&#13;
                         service delivery. All of these factors impact the current and future quality of life, business&#13;
                         environment, competitiveness, opportunities for jobs, and achievement of poverty&#13;
                         alleviation goals. These issues need to be addressed while they are still manageable in&#13;
                         order for Dar es Salaam to build a foundation for its future status as mega-city.&#13;

       Creation in the Context of Urbanization&#13;
&#13;
                â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ The rapid rate of urbanization in Tanzania has led to the growth of non-farm&#13;
                   businesses, with the number of businesses increasing by almost 15 percent per&#13;
                   year. Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s structural transformation is clearly under way.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ Most urban businesses are small, informal, unspecialized, young and fragile.&#13;
                   Such businesses are unlikely to become vectors of growth and employment in&#13;
                   the coming years. However, if only 20 percent of these businesses were able&#13;
                   to add a single additional employee, this would lead to the creation of almost&#13;
                   400,000 new jobs in urban areas every year.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ Running a small business in urban Tanzania is a difficult endeavor. While key&#13;
                   constraints vary according to the nature of the business, its sector of activity,&#13;
                   and its geographical location, the most important include: (i) the lack of the&#13;
                   required skills of the labor force; (ii) the lack of access to external finance; (iii)&#13;
                   the cost of connectivity; (iv) the burdensome and insecure administrative&#13;
                   environment; and (v) the weak rule of law.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#153;¦â&#153;¦ There is no blue print for harnessing the potential for growth of urban businesses,&#13;
                   but a minimal set of improvements is needed to address the low level of skills&#13;
                   in the labor force, high congestion costs, administrative barriers and insecurity,&#13;
                   and obstacles that hinder businesses from achieving economies of scale. Such&#13;
                   efforts will require a significant policy change at the core, rather than at the&#13;
                   margins, and strong leadership from both the public and private sectors.&#13;

                       Box 9: Growing small businesses in an environment of distrust&#13;
&#13;
            Victoria is in the fifth year of running a small electronic equipment business in Dar es&#13;
            Salaam. The business operates on a small margin and has not grown to the point where&#13;
            she can afford to hire an extra handHer often justifiable lack of trust in the environment&#13;
            she operates in acts as a major constraint against growing her business. For example,&#13;
            she has to implement a standard policy of requiring 100 percent upfront payment for&#13;
            goods purchased from her in order to guard against the risk of not being paid after&#13;
            the merchandise is delivered. Such a policy, while perhaps necessary, is detrimental to&#13;
            the expansion of business as clients who do not have the necessary resources to pay&#13;
            upfront could be driven away.&#13;
            This lack of trust extends to employees. If Victoria had the resources to hire an extra&#13;
            worker, she would only recruit from her family circle or at least from her own ethnic group.&#13;
            But the employment of workers from affinity groups may not result in high levels of&#13;
            efficiency, as workers thus employed are not necessarily the most competent for the job.&#13;
            Distrust also restricts her access to credit, which is vital for expansion. With no access to&#13;
            credit, firms are forced to postpone crucial investment and other decisions. The informal&#13;
            loan sharks who have the capacity to provide credit often end up raising interest rates&#13;
            to ridiculous levels, as they face high levels of default and do not trust the borrower to&#13;
            repay the loans provided. At the same time, a small businessperson such as Victoria&#13;
            has a strong fear of borrowing, because she feels the terms and conditions of any loan&#13;
            that she is able to secure are designed to ensure that she will forfeit whatever asset she&#13;
            borrows against.&#13;
            Distrust in the general environment is exacerbated by the common occurrence of&#13;
            armed robberies and theft in business districts. While Dar es Salaam does not face the            The key&#13;
            same level of criminality as Nairobi or Lagos, the level of insecurity has nonetheless            constraints&#13;
            increased considerably in recent years. Bigger businesses have the capacity to protect            that businesses&#13;
            themselves through insurance and better security systems, but smaller businesses are              in Tanzanian&#13;
            simply unable to do so, as they lack the capability and resources.                                cities face vary&#13;
                                                                                                              according to&#13;

          proportion end up in rural towns and                of secondary cities as a path towards&#13;
          secondary cities. Those that migrate to             more    inclusive   growth   is   necessary.&#13;

&#13;
            The Tanzanian film industry is a nascent and largely informal industry, but one that is&#13;
            expanding rapidly and gaining popularity within the Tanzanian population. Currently,&#13;
            there are about ten new low-budget movies being produced each week in Tanzania,&#13;
            with about 4-6 released onto the market which consists mainly of Swahili-speaking&#13;
            countries within the East African Community.&#13;

                             Production: There are about 50 independent producers in Tanzania, of whom around&#13;
                             70 percent are based in Dar es Salaam. Most production companies consist of a&#13;
                             single producer, with other crewmembers being hired on a freelance basis. A typical&#13;
                             production house can produce a complete low budget/low quality film in a short period&#13;
                             of time, often in less than a week. The cost of production for a budget film is also low,&#13;
                             typically amounting to less than US$ 5,000.&#13;
&#13;
                             Distribution: While there are about 24 small distributors in the market, there is one&#13;
                             leading distributor, Steps Entertainment, which has a near-monopoly on distribution&#13;
                             networks around the country, and its own chain of wholesale outlets. Distributors often&#13;
                             invest in films prior to production and are responsible for public relations, advertising,&#13;
                             and duplication costs and services.&#13;
&#13;
                             Target audience: There about 10,000 video exhibition halls (bandas) and approximately&#13;
                             25,000 video rental libraries across the country that mainly target lower income segments&#13;
                             of the population. The cost of renting a movie from these outlets is approximately TZS&#13;
                             500 (US$ 0.31), while the cost to watch a movie in a banda is TZS 100-200 (US$ 0.06&#13;
                             - 0.13). With an average of about 62 customers per day, a banda generates revenues of&#13;
                             approximately TZS 12,000 per day (US$ 7.50).&#13;
&#13;
                             Potential for growth: Within this fast growing niche industry, there are some potential&#13;
        There is             opportunities for building industry infrastructure and creating jobs along the value&#13;
   encouraging               chain. Demand appears high, with 76 percent of interviewed outlet owners stating that&#13;

            Tanzania ranks second highest in terms of the rate of mobile financial transactions in                            to formal&#13;
            Africa. At the end of 2013, Tanzania had over 11 million active mobile money subscribers                          finance.&#13;
            (approximately 44 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s adult population), with 74,000 mobile money&#13;
            agents spread over 19 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s total landmass. This has spurred the use&#13;
            of innovative platforms for collaboration between MFIs and mobile phones.&#13;
&#13;
            For example, MFIs such as Tujijenge in Tanzania have started to use mobile platforms&#13;
            such as Vodacom to collect loan repayments. A borrower with less than US$1,800 in&#13;
            loans from Tujijenge now has to use M-Pesa (Vodacomâ&#128;&#153;s mobile money platform) for&#13;
            loan repayment. In Kenya, several MFIs offer the repayment of loans via mobile banking&#13;
            platforms for both individual and group loans. These include Small and Micro Enterprise&#13;
            Programme (SMEP) and Kenya Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Finance Trust (KWFT), who started using&#13;
            M-Pesa in 2009 for loan repayments. M-Kesho is another product which results from&#13;
            a partnership between Safaricom (M-Pesa) and Equity Bank, and allows customers to&#13;
            save more (by enabling deposits at all M-Pesa outlets) and to accrue interest on their&#13;
            accounts. These are examples that can be emulated in Tanzania as demand grows for&#13;
            more sophisticated financial products in the semi-formal financing space.&#13;

            Tanzania economic update : who wants a job?
            The magnetic power of cities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This fifth economic update also examines
            prospects for economic prosperity in the context of rapid
            urbanization; in particular, how the growth of cities can be
            harnessed to create productive jobs for a labor force that
            is expected to double in the next 15 years. By 2030, Dar es
            Salaam will be a mega city of over 10 million people. As
            demonstrated by many countries in the world, cities
            encourage the creation and expansion of businesses by
            reducing distances between suppliers and customers. Can Dar
            es Salaam and other Tanzanian urban areas become thriving
            cities? Can they avoid becoming metropolis slums?
            Urbanization comes with significant challenges, notably in
            terms of increased pressure on infrastructure, housing, and
            service provision. The quality of the business climate in
            urban Tanzania will need to be improved, as most small and
            large entrepreneurs suffer from the uncertainty, corruption,
            and insecurity that characterize the business environment.
            This economic update argues that these challenges need to be
            addressed with a sense of urgency.
