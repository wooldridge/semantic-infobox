Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles&#13;
of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies,&#13;
its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the&#13;
use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank&#13;
under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an&#13;
individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee,&#13;

respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;
complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear&#13;
any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;

3.2   The Bank shall additionally deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust&#13;
Fund from Ethiopia Productive Safety Net IV Partnership Multi Donor Trust Fund (TF072401),&#13;
unless the amounts therein are insufficient, in which case any remainder shall be deducted and retained&#13;
for the Bank's own account from such Installment.&#13;

Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the&#13;
first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change,&#13;
the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;
which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and&#13;
which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments&#13;
to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration&#13;
