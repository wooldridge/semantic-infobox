            Output-based education : the evolution of
            contracts for schools in the U.K.
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The private sector has provided
            investment funding and services for the United Kingdom
            public sector schools through output-based contracts since
            1996. Under these contracts firms provide accommodation and
            related services, while teachers, still employed by the
            public sector, provide the core education services. Firms
            bid their lowest prices, and payments to the winning bidder
            begin only when services become available at the defined
            standards. The contracts have evolved from building new
            schools, to bundling maintenance and rehabilitation across
            many schools, to setting up information technology
            facilities under contracts incorporating learning targets
            for students.
