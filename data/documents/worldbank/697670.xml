            Tradable property rights to water : how to
            improve water use and resolve water conflicts
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In most countries, water is still
            regarded as public property.  Despite growing water scarcity
            and the high costs of hydraulic infrastructure, water is
            typically underpriced and used wastefully.  Some
            water-scarce countries have permitted informal sales of
            water for a season or permanent sales of property rights to
            water.  This Note cited examples of countries that passed
            legislation to permit tradable property rights to water.
            The advantages of tradable property rights to water are 1)
            improved productivity of water, 2) sound investment, and 3)
            increased investment and growth.  A tradable water rights
            system also has the potential to improve operations, reduce
            water conflicts, rationalize ongoing and future irrigation
            development, and free up government resources for activities
            that have a public good content or positive externalities.
            And it is likely to especially benefit the poor and to help
            conserve natural resources.
