STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Despite several years of economic stabilization policies, Jamaica continues to face&#13;
a challenging economic and social environment characterized by low growth, high&#13;
inflation and unacceptable levels of poverty. Along with its continuing priority on&#13;
improving macroeconomic performance, Government has placed social development and&#13;
poverty reduction at the center of its medium-term framework. The Prime Minister has&#13;
consolidated responsibility for the Social Agenda in his office and Cabinet recently&#13;
approved a National Poverty Eradication Policy and Program. The new policy departs&#13;
from Government's earlier approach by emphasizing community-based interventions&#13;
undertaken in partnership with non-governmental (NGOs) and community-based&#13;
organizations (CBOs), the private sector and communities themselves.&#13;
1.2   Recognizing the limited capacity of existing government institutions to catalyze&#13;
small-scale projects at the community level, Cabinet in December 1995 approved the&#13;
establishment of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund as a key component of&#13;
Government's National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP). The Jamaica Social&#13;
Investment Fund (JSIF) is designed as a demand-driven organization to mobilize and&#13;
channel additional resources to low-income communities. Drawing on the lessons of&#13;
social investment funds elsewhere, the JSIF will finance small-scale social and economic&#13;
infrastructure, social services and organizational strengthening subprojects sponsored by&#13;
a range of institutions, including central and local government agencies, NGOs/CBOs,&#13;
community groups and private sector entities. The proposed project would support the&#13;
establishment and operations of the JSIF with a World Bank loan of US$20 million, as&#13;
part of the JSIF's US$50 million total four-year program. In addition to financial&#13;
support, the Bank's role is critical in bringing international experience to the design and&#13;
operation of the JSIF, in leveraging additional funds from other multilateral and bilateral&#13;
donor agencies, and in building linkages among Government, NGOs, community groups&#13;
and the private sector.&#13;
2. ECONOMIC AND SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Economic Context&#13;
2.1   Jamaica is the largest English-speaking Caribbean country with a population of&#13;
2.5 million. The economy is highly sensitive to international price and demand changes,&#13;
primarily due to the nature of its productive base and its dependence upon imported oil&#13;
for commercial energy consumption. Jamaica's principal economic activities are tourism,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
manufacturing, bauxite/alumina mining and, in employment terms, agriculture and the&#13;
informal trading sector. Like other Caribbean countries, its ecosystems are fragile and&#13;
vulnerable to natural disasters.&#13;
2.2   In the decade following independence in 1962, Jamaica's GDP growth rate&#13;
averaged about five percent per annum. From 1973 through the mid- 1980s, however,&#13;
Jamaica's economy experienced sustained contraction due to the increase in oil prices,&#13;
unfavorable terms of trade and domestic policies which resulted in large fiscal deficits,&#13;
overvaluation of the Jamaican dollar, excessive borrowing and high inflation. Disparities&#13;
in income widened. The overall result was an erosion of private sector confidence, a&#13;
reduction in investment and an outflow of capital and human resources.&#13;
2.3   In an effort to stem the decline, Government in the latter half of the 1980s&#13;
implemented stabilization measures and adopted market-oriented policies which resulted&#13;
in GDP growth averaging 3.9 percent per annum between 1986 and 1991. During this&#13;
period, however, there was also a reduction in Government expenditure on social&#13;
services, the removal or reduction of subsidies on many goods and services and a&#13;
significant deterioration in Government's institutional capacity to deliver essential&#13;
services. Declining living standards affected the poor the most.&#13;
2.4   The current government, elected in 1989 and re-elected in 1993, accelerated&#13;
reforms including privatization, trade and exchange rate liberalization and enhanced fiscal&#13;
management aimed at promoting private sector, export-led growth. As of June 1995,&#13;
Jamaica had achieved most of its policy targets: the budget showed a surplus, central&#13;
bank losses had decreased, inflation and lending interest rates had declined and net&#13;
international reserves equaled about four months of import cover. GDP growth, however,&#13;
remained low (0.8% in 1994 and 0.5% in 1995) and insufficient to raise the living&#13;
standards of the population.&#13;
2.5   Jamaica currently faces a resurgence of high inflation (25.6% in CY 1995),&#13;
exchange rate pressure, widening external imbalances, high interest rates and a fragile&#13;
financial sector. Real public and private sector wages are rising faster than productivity&#13;
gains fueling a rise in imports, particularly of consumer goods. Private sector confidence&#13;
is low. An estimated 28 percent of the population remains below the poverty line and the&#13;
social fabric of the country is under stress.&#13;
B. Poverty in Jamaica&#13;
2.6   Poverty in Jamaica is not a new phenomenon and income distribution has&#13;
historically been highly skewed. Per capita income is now lower than at the beginning of&#13;
the 1970s. In 1993, the poorest fifth of the population had access to only five percent of&#13;
national consumption expenditure while the wealthiest quintile consumed almost ten&#13;
times as much (49%). Trends in poverty mirror the economic phases detailed above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
From 1962 to the early 1970s, poverty declined because aggregate income was growing&#13;
strongly as the bauxite and tourism sectors boomed. Between the early 1 970s and mid-&#13;
1980s, a decline in aggregate income negated the positive impacts of social safety nets&#13;
and structural adjustment on the poor. According to the Survey of Living Conditions&#13;
conducted annually by Government with Bank support, poverty has increased since 1988,&#13;
becoming particularly acute in 1991 following the rapid devaluation of the Jamaican&#13;
dollar.&#13;
2.7   As of 1993, using a consumption-based per capita poverty line, 28 percent of the&#13;
population lives in poverty. Sixty percent of the poor live in rural areas with the&#13;
remaining distributed evenly between the Kingston Metropolitan Area and other towns.&#13;
The depth and severity of poverty are also greater in the rural areas where poverty is&#13;
characterized by an under-productive small farm sector, low wage employment or lack of&#13;
employment opportunities, low levels of education and inadequate physical and social&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
2.8   The urban poor, though fewer in number, are arguably more vulnerable to changes&#13;
in the economic environment as they are more fully integrated into the monetized&#13;
economy and usually have fewer resources upon which to draw. Well-being is linked&#13;
closely with ownership of assets including labor, human capital, land and housing,&#13;
household relations and social capital. High levels of violence in urban areas erode these&#13;
assets, resulting in lack of work and employment opportunities, disruptions in the&#13;
delivery of social services, disincentives to invest in housing and the disintegration of&#13;
family and social structures, and thus heighten vulnerability. '&#13;
2.9   At a national level, a disproportionate percentage of the poor are youth under the&#13;
age of 25 and 13 percent are elderly. Women comprise 51 percent of those living below&#13;
the poverty line and poverty is only slightly more prevalent among female-headed&#13;
households. In the Kingston Metropolitan Area, however, where there are more female&#13;
headed-households (65%) than in other towns (47%) or rural areas (45%), the prevalence&#13;
of poverty is significantly higher for female headed-households (21 %) than for male&#13;
( 11%) headed-households.&#13;
2.10  The unemployment rate of the poor in 1995 was 15 percent: 70 percent of whom&#13;
were below the age of 25 and 65 percent of whom were women. Poverty is largely a&#13;
phenomena of the working poor as demand for their labor is not strong enough to push up&#13;
real earnings and they lack skills and access to higher-paying jobs. The majority of poor&#13;
are farmers, agricultural laborers, domestic servants, street vendors and craftspersons.&#13;
There is a clear association between poverty and years of education: nearly 70 percent of&#13;
World Bank, 1995. A Participatory Study of Urban Poverty and Violence in Jamaica, TWURD,&#13;
December 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
the employed poor reported no secondary education compared with 45 percent of the&#13;
employed non-poor.2&#13;
C. Social Context&#13;
2.11  In general, Jamaica's living standard indices are relatively favorable compared&#13;
with other middle-income countries in the region. The educational system's coverage is&#13;
extensive with net enrollment rates of 84 percent for pre-primary, 98 percent for primary,&#13;
85 percent for lower secondary and 45 percent for upper secondary. Life expectancy is&#13;
over 70 years, infant mortality is 24 per 1,000 live births, severe malnutrition is rare and&#13;
child immunization almost universal. No significant gender bias exists in the provision&#13;
of social services.&#13;
2.12  These social indicators, however, mask underlying problems in both the education&#13;
and health sectors. The educational system is characterized by deteriorating quality and&#13;
inequity in the provision of resources and education opportunities particularly across&#13;
socio-economic groups. Of the 15-19 age group, 13.5 percent are illiterate, rising to 17.3&#13;
percent for 20-24 year olds. The latest available data on primary school leavers (1988)&#13;
reveals that over 30 percent were functionally illiterate. Attendance and functional&#13;
literacy vary by gender, school type and location with males, pupils from schools serving&#13;
low-income families and rural areas recording the lowest attendance and literacy rates.&#13;
2.13   Fiscal stringency needed for macroeconomic stabilization has taken its toll on the&#13;
social sectors over the past ten years. Schools are under-resourced and low educational&#13;
quality is in part due to a shortage of educational inputs and inadequate infrastructure.&#13;
Educational materials are severely limited and reduced levels of maintenance&#13;
expenditures have rendered the physical environments of many schools not conducive to&#13;
learning. Furthermore, available resources are not distributed equitably. Schools serving&#13;
students from low-income families areas are relatively poorly equipped, are in worse&#13;
physical condition and suffer from overcrowding.&#13;
2.14  In the health sector, the disease profile is increasingly "life-style"-related&#13;
resembling that of higher-income, developed countries. Deaths are due less frequently to&#13;
infectious and vector-borne diseases than to chronic and degenerative diseases which are&#13;
inherently more expensive to treat. Injuries, including homicides, are the second leading&#13;
cause of healthy life years lost and rank as the main cause of death among males aged&#13;
15-44. Concern remains, however, about high and preventable perinatal mortality rates.&#13;
2.15  As in education, prolonged insufficient public funding for health care has caused a&#13;
serious deterioration in the quality of care in public health facilities. One result has been&#13;
a significant shift to private providers for outpatient care, even among poorer groups.&#13;
2 World Bank, 1994. Jamaica A Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction: Country Economic&#13;
Memorandum, LA3C2, April 12, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Compared to private facilities, public facilities are in a poor state of repair and lack&#13;
equipment and basic supplies. The relationship between health and poverty is just as&#13;
clear as that between poverty and education. The poor are only half as likely to seek&#13;
medical care as the non-poor and spend approximately one-third as much treating their&#13;
illnesses. Furthermore, the poor remain sick for longer periods and are more restricted in&#13;
carrying out their daily activities than the non-poor.&#13;
2.16  Water and Sanitation statistics show a greater association of the rural areas with&#13;
inferior living conditions. In 1991, 24 percent of the population lacked access to safe&#13;
drinking water while in the rural areas the proportion was 40 percent. Access to&#13;
sanitation facilities is relatively high, but in rural areas three times as many people lack&#13;
good sanitation facilities than in the urban areas. There are also considerable deficiencies&#13;
in the water and sanitation facilities within schools, health centers and other public&#13;
infrastructure, thereby increasing overall health risks. The road and street network is&#13;
badly deteriorated due to lack of maintenance expenditure. In some areas, roads are&#13;
completely cut-off, leaving communities isolated and at times causing social&#13;
disturbances. Drainage is inadequate and severe flooding not uncommon.&#13;
2.17 The high levels of crime, predominant in poor urban neighborhoods, have&#13;
detrimental impacts on all of these sectors. Violence limits access to school, results in&#13;
high costs to the health care system and impedes the delivery of water and sanitation.&#13;
D. Institutional Setting&#13;
2.18 Social services and infrastructure in Jamaica are provided by central government&#13;
ministries and agencies, local government (Parish Councils), non-governmental and&#13;
community-based organizations and the private sector. The plethora of actors and&#13;
programs presents Government with a major coordination challenge.&#13;
2.19 Public Sector. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is the principal provider of&#13;
formal primary and secondary education, with only about five percent of students&#13;
enrolled in private schools. In contrast, 80 percent of children enrolled at the pre-primary&#13;
level attend community-based Basic Schools which raise most of their revenue through&#13;
fees and donations. Technical/vocational training is provided through the secondary&#13;
school system, skills-training programs offered by the Human Employment and Resource&#13;
Training/National Training Agency and public and private employers, and training&#13;
institutions that offer apprenticeships. Most special education is provided in schools&#13;
owned and operated by NGOs which receive limited government subventions. Adult&#13;
education is offered through a government-funded company and over 75 NGOs.&#13;
3World Bank, 1994. Jamaica Health Sector Review: Present Status and Future Options, LA3HR,&#13;
December 14, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
2.20 The public health system is highly centralized. The Ministry of Health (MOH)&#13;
provides almost all of the inpatient care through a network of 344 health centers and 24&#13;
hospitals, undertakes health education and environmental health activities, and is&#13;
responsible for family planning promotion. In recent years, the private sector's role has&#13;
increased significantly such that it now provides about 75 percent of outpatient services.&#13;
The NGO community plays an active role in health promotion. In nutrition, the MOH&#13;
implements the Supplementary Feeding Program targeted to malnourished children under&#13;
five, a Food Stamp Program is administered through the Ministry of Labour, Social&#13;
Security and Sport and the MOE provides lunch to approximately 280,000 students under&#13;
the School Feeding Program.&#13;
2.21  In social welfare, the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Sport administers&#13;
an array of public assistance programs aimed primarily at the aged, disabled and destitute,&#13;
in part through grants to twelve private voluntary organizations. Additional poverty&#13;
reduction programs are being implemented by the Office of the Prime Minister and the&#13;
Social Development Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Rural Agricultural&#13;
Development Agency, and the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport and the National&#13;
Water Commission as well as NGOs and the private sector. The new National Poverty&#13;
Eradication Program seeks to streamline and coordinate these varied and at times&#13;
duplicative initiatives.&#13;
2.22  At the local level, Parish Councils will play an increasingly important role in the&#13;
provision of basic infrastructure and services such as water supply, road maintenance and&#13;
solid waste management. Responsibilities between the parishes and central ministries are&#13;
being delineated under Government's Local Government Reform Program. Water and&#13;
sanitation responsibilities will be shared among the parishes, the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and Works and the National Water Commission. Responsibility for roads&#13;
will be split between the Ministry of Local Government and Works and the parishes. The&#13;
number of entities currently involved combined with inadequate financial resources have&#13;
resulted in slowed expansion of basic infrastructure and significant deterioration of&#13;
existing investments.&#13;
2.23  Implementation Capacity. The public sector accounts for eight percent of jobs&#13;
in Jamaica and expenditure on personnel is Govermnent's largest single recurrent cost&#13;
item (54% of non-interest expenditures in 1994/95). Despite its numerous agencies and&#13;
employees, the general level of efficiency and effectiveness of public entities is low and&#13;
the quality of service to the public has declined over the years.&#13;
2.24  The major public institutions implementing poverty programs face institutional&#13;
constraints common to the entire public sector. These constraints include: limited&#13;
capacity of the core of ministries to provide strategic leadership, formulate effective&#13;
policies and monitor operations of line entities; over-centralized authority in financial and&#13;
personnel management decisions; serious human resource deficiencies due to low wages,&#13;
insufficient training and lack of effective performance evaluation systems; and&#13;
cumbersome budgetary and procurement regulations. Government recognizes its weak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
administrative capacity in implementing policies and programs and has committed itself&#13;
to reforming central and local government in order to boost efficiency. These reforms,&#13;
however, will take several years to yield results and, in the meantime, the above&#13;
constraints will continue to pose serious impediments to the reduction of poverty. Failure&#13;
to tackle poverty effectively in turn poses risks to the sustainability of Govermment's&#13;
macroeconomic reform program.&#13;
2.25  Non-governmental Organizations. There are a large number and variety of&#13;
social institutions operating at the community level in Jamaica, ranging from relatively&#13;
loosely-organized associations such as sports clubs and Neighborhood Watch committees&#13;
to more formal institutions such as schools, churches and NGOs. These institutions are&#13;
important for social cohesion as well as economic development.&#13;
2.26  Jamaica has a long history of voluntary service, with churches and other&#13;
philanthropic institutions playing an increasingly important role in the delivery of social&#13;
services after the end of slavery. The 1930s and 1940s saw the establishment of a new&#13;
type of organization focusing on the development of community cohesion, community&#13;
building and self-reliance. The NGO community continued to flourish after&#13;
independence in 1962 and expanded its programs in response the sharp decline of&#13;
Government social expenditures in the 1970s and 1980s. The shift from a welfare-based&#13;
to a more developmental approach has become more pronounced in the 1990s.&#13;
2.27 There are approximately 150 non-governmental organizations promoting social&#13;
development in Jamaica. Rough estimates indicate that their total annual budget exceeds&#13;
J$200 million (US$5 million). NGO programs are concentrated in the area of human&#13;
services, including youth and human development, formal and non-formal education,&#13;
welfare services, disaster relief and rehabilitation and health and counseling. NGOs are&#13;
also involved in public education and advocacy, community development, environmental&#13;
protection, services for the disabled, employment creation, housing and sanitation,&#13;
agriculture and legal assistance. Most NGOs are headquartered in the Kingston&#13;
Metropolitan Area with programs concentrated in urban areas. Rural areas are served&#13;
predominantly by community-based organizations which are comprised of the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves and operate in a specific geographic area. Estimates of the&#13;
numbers of CBOs range from 1,200 to 1,500 with almost 70 percent in rural Jamaica.&#13;
There are also a vast number of citizens organizations, benevolent societies,&#13;
neighborhood associations, service clubs and the like active across the island.&#13;
2.28 Among the large numbers of social institutions at the community level, a&#13;
distinction can be made between those that are hierarchical versus horizontal in structure.&#13;
Hierarchical institutions, such as churches and social welfare systems, tend towards top -&#13;
down delivery of services. Institutions based on horizontal relationships, such as sports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
clubs, homework clubs and parenting groups, facilitate cooperation and collaboration and&#13;
as such build social capital.&#13;
2.29 The implementation capacity of non-governmental and community-based&#13;
organizations varies significantly. In general, strengths include: close relationship with&#13;
communities and involvement of beneficiaries in program implementation; willingness to&#13;
innovate in social service provision; flexibility in responding to observed and expressed&#13;
needs of target populations; commitment to serving as a channel of communication&#13;
between the disadvantaged and decision-makers; and an openness to collaborating with&#13;
other sectors, including government, private sector and donor/lender community.&#13;
Weaknesses include: limited coverage, weak management structures and financial bases,&#13;
inadequate record-keeping and information management, lack of collaboration and&#13;
coordination within the sector and between other sectors and limited influence on policy.&#13;
2.30  Deliberate attempts have been made to strengthen the working relationship&#13;
between the public and non-governmental sectors. At the urging of the NGO community,&#13;
Government established an NGO Desk at the Planning Institute of Jamaica to structure&#13;
the collaboration between the two sectors. Government now involves NGOs in the&#13;
planning and implementation of major policies and programs, most recently in the&#13;
preparation of the National Poverty Eradication Program. NGOs have also sought the&#13;
input of Government in their own programs and have offered their services to&#13;
Government through contractual and other arrangements.&#13;
2.31  Private Sector. The local manufacturing and contracting industries in Jamaica&#13;
contribute approximately 18 and 9 percent of GDP respectively. There are a limited&#13;
number of firms considered efficient at undertaking large-scale civil works projects.&#13;
Small civil works contracting firms are numerous, coverage is island-wide and technical&#13;
capacity is adequate. Contractors have been exposed to competitive bidding procedures.&#13;
E. Social Expenditure and Financing&#13;
2.32  Although Government has recently reduced its all embracing role as social&#13;
provider and has shifted a part of the responsibility to individuals and the private and&#13;
voluntary sectors, it continues to provide a wide range of both education and health&#13;
services. The reduction in Government resources has resulted in declining quality&#13;
throughout the sectors, with the poor having least access to higher quality services.&#13;
2.33  The resources for public expenditures in the social sectors are largely channeled&#13;
through the central government budget. During the 1 990s, real public expenditures on&#13;
education and health have fallen as a share of the total government budget. While the&#13;
Ministry of Education commands the largest share of total government non-debt&#13;
4World Bank, 1995. A Participatory Study of Urban Poverty and Violence in Jamaica, TWURD,&#13;
December 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
expenditures, its share declined from 13 percent in 1989/90 to 8.5 percent in 1995/96. In&#13;
real terms, Government expenditures on education in 1994/95 barely exceeded 1982/83&#13;
expenditures. Salaries and allowances account for 95 percent of the Ministry's recurrent&#13;
expenditures resulting in the severe underfunding of non-wage recurrent and capital&#13;
expenditures. Educational materials are inadequate, equipment is often non-functional&#13;
and physical facilities are in poor condition. In 1995/96, 33 percent of Government's&#13;
recurrent education expenditures was allocated to primary education, 29 percent to&#13;
secondary and 28 percent to tertiary.&#13;
2.34  The Ministry of Health's share of public expenditure hovers around six percent,&#13;
down from a high of eight percent in 1982/83. Between 1982/83 and 1989/90 real&#13;
resources allocated to the health sector declined by roughly one-third. In 1993/94,&#13;
salaries and allowances accounted for 79 percent of the recurrent budget. Overall, the&#13;
share of health expenditures on other goods and services has declined from 28 percent in&#13;
1991/92 to 17 percent in 1993/94. Secondary and tertiary care has received 60 to 70&#13;
percent of the Ministry of Health's recurrent budget over the last decade while primary&#13;
care has accounted for 20 percent. The recurrent budget for primary care has remained&#13;
constant in real terms despite the expansion of primary care infrastructure in the late&#13;
1970s and early 1980s. Maintenance of both physical infrastructure and equipment&#13;
(medical and non-medical) has been underfunded for years.&#13;
2.35  Total spending on roads has averaged only about one percent of GDP over the&#13;
past three years. The chronic underfunding of rehabilitation and routine maintenance has&#13;
resulted in a badly deteriorated road network.5&#13;
3. GOVERNMENT'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY AND RATIONALE&#13;
FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A. Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
3.1   Government acknowledges the precarious economic situation and recognizes that&#13;
it must continue short-term macroeconomic policies while simultaneously attending to&#13;
significant structural problems. The Government has elevated its commitment toward&#13;
social development and consolidated responsibility for the Social Agenda in the Office of&#13;
the Prime Minister. The Social Agenda is a broad set of social development and welfare&#13;
programs with the long-term objectives of eradicating poverty, developing human&#13;
resources, promoting social rehabilitation and fostering community development. As a&#13;
major component of the Social Agenda, Cabinet recently approved the National Policy&#13;
Towards Poverty Eradication and the National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP)&#13;
which seek to mobilize all available resources in a streamlined and coordinated action&#13;
designed to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty.&#13;
5World Bank, 1995. Jamaica Public Expenditure Review, LA3C2, April 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
3.2   Government's poverty policy is predicated on the assumption that a successful&#13;
poverty eradication program must incorporate economic growth while recognizing that&#13;
social development is integral to and essential for such growth. The NPEP has four&#13;
major sub-programs: (i) community-based activities to create and sustain development&#13;
activities at the local level; (ii) human resources and social development to provide&#13;
equitable access of the poor to quality education and health services; (iii) protection of&#13;
environmental and natural resources; and (iv) building of the enabling environment to&#13;
strengthen and promote sound economic policies to achieve growth and to establish an&#13;
institutional framework aimed at more efficient management, coordination and coherency&#13;
in program implementation. The poverty program is guided by four principles:&#13;
integration to optimize resources and amplify impact; partnership to ensure that&#13;
Government works closely with the private sector, NGOs and CBOs, communities and&#13;
donor/lender agencies; community-based participation involving communities in&#13;
identifying their needs, designing, implementing and evaluating projects; and targeting&#13;
to reach the most deprived communities island-wide. As an important new mechanism to&#13;
achieve its poverty reduction goals, Government decided to establish the Jamaica Social&#13;
Investment Fund to mobilize and channel additional resources to priority projects in&#13;
targeted communities using an approach consistent with all of these principles.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.3   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Jamaica focuses on Government's&#13;
key development challenges: (a) macroeconomic stability, increased investment and&#13;
growth, (b) poverty reduction, (c) human resource development and (d) public sector&#13;
modernization.&#13;
3.4   Social Sector Strategy. The primary operational objective of the Bank's&#13;
involvement in the social sectors is to increase the human capital of Jamaica's citizens&#13;
and improve the living standards and income-earning potential of the poorest. The&#13;
Bank's current focus is on strengthening the existing social sector portfolio which&#13;
includes the Social Sector Development and Reform of Secondary Education Projects and&#13;
designing two new projects. The Student Loan Project seeks to redirect resources from&#13;
tertiary education to lower levels where social returns are higher. The proposed JSIF is&#13;
designed to assist Government in reducing poverty by reaching the vulnerable groups&#13;
underserved by existing traditional programs. The Urban Poverty and Violence Study&#13;
has been instrumental in designing the menu of subprojects eligible for JSIF funding and&#13;
its operating procedures, including eligibility of subproject sponsors, the promotions and&#13;
project identification strategy, social appraisal criteria and contracting and disbursement&#13;
arrangements. The Bank's involvement in the JSIF is particularly important to:&#13;
(i) capitalize on its considerable experience with social investment funds around the&#13;
world; (ii) mobilize additional external financing; and (iii) help build linkages among&#13;
government agencies, NGOs, community groups and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
3.5    Relationship to other Bank-financed Projects. The Bank is currently preparing&#13;
three projects which will strengthen and modernize central and local governments and&#13;
assist in rebalancing the roles of the public and private sectors. The Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Project will support Government's efforts to: (i) continue the&#13;
rationalization of the public sector through privatization; (ii) improve the capability of&#13;
ministries in policy formulation, coordination and management of policy implementation,&#13;
and (iii) improve the efficiency of key government departments by converting them into&#13;
"Executive Agencies" enjoying greater managerial and financial autonomy. '[he project&#13;
will also strengthen GOJ's procurement policies and practices. The Parish&#13;
Infrastructure Project will extend local government reforms by strengthening the&#13;
capacity of parish governments to develop and maintain minor water supply, roads and&#13;
solid waste services. The Water and Sewerage Project will rehabilitate and&#13;
commercialize the water company alongside Government plans to introduce a private&#13;
sector operator. The proposed JSIF Project complements these longer-term institutional&#13;
reforms and larger, technically more complicated investments by financing small-scale,&#13;
community-level social and economic infrastructure and social services interventions in&#13;
targeted areas using an efficient new delivery mechanism. The structure of the JSIF&#13;
shares many of the characteristics of the Executive Agencies proposed under the Public&#13;
Sector Modernization Project, including strong management, greater autonomy in&#13;
financial and personnel management in exchange for strict accountability for&#13;
predetermined outputs, streamlined operational procedures, and a modem Management&#13;
Information System to enhance the quality and speed of decision-making and evaluation.&#13;
Under the Parish Infrastructure Project, Parish Councils would be assisted in preparing,&#13;
with communities, subproject proposals to be submitted to the JSIF for financing. The&#13;
Agricultural Support Services Project being prepared will channel additional resources&#13;
to combat rural poverty by assisting small farmers through improved research and&#13;
extension.&#13;
C. Lessons from Experience&#13;
3.6    The design of the proposed project takes into account lessons leamed from the&#13;
Bank's experience with other investment projects in Jamaica, relevant programs and&#13;
institutions currently operating in the country, and the design and implementation of&#13;
6&#13;
social fund projects elsewhere .&#13;

3.7   Bank Projects in Jamaica. Implementation of Bank-financed investment&#13;
projects executed by central government ministries has generally been weak. Sluggish&#13;
implementation results in cost overruns and delays benefits reaching target groups. The&#13;
record has been particularly weak in civil works carried out by the Ministries of Health,&#13;
Education and Local Government and Works. A recent Country Portfolio Performance&#13;
Review (CPPR) with Government highlighted implementation constraints including:&#13;
weak technical capacity of personnel within ministries, insufficient involvement of&#13;
Government counterparts in project design, lack of counterpart funds due to fiscal&#13;
adjustment, and cumbersome budgetary and procurement regulations. The procurement&#13;
of goods and services is not conducted in an effective, cost-efficient or transparent&#13;
manner. For example, contracts valued over J$2.5 million (US$62,500) require approval&#13;
from the Government Contracts' Award Committee, the Ministry of Finance and Cabinet.&#13;
Serious deficiencies also exist in contract management relating mostly to the supervision&#13;
of contractors and in the monitoring and expediting of deliveries. The Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Project seeks to rationalize and strengthen Government procurement&#13;
procedures. Additional lessons highlight the importance of local ownership of reforms,&#13;
beneficiary participation in project design and providing sufficient technical assistance&#13;
and training. The design of the JSIF as detailed in Chapter 4 not only takes these into&#13;
account, but is in part a response to these impediments.&#13;
3.8   Government Poverty Reduction Projects. Two recent reviews of Government's&#13;
poverty alleviation program and the four main institutions (three Government and one&#13;
NGO) which fund social and environmental projects reveal similar constraints and&#13;
lessons. Most of the poverty projects reported slow implementation due to low cash&#13;
flow, inadequate staffing and slow decision-making. Social services and employment-&#13;
generation projects were most successful when community cooperation and private&#13;
voluntary organizations were included in program implementation.7 The institutional&#13;
review highlighted four main issues: (i) lack of formalized procedures for funding or&#13;
implementing projects; (ii) inadequate administration and supervision of projects due to&#13;
limited financial and weak human resources; (iii) incomplete and imprecise project&#13;
proposals and cost estimates, complicated by the consistent overestimation of costs&#13;
particularly when resources were considered "free"; and (iv) lack of institutional and&#13;
financial autonomy which resulted in delayed and insufficient disbursements.&#13;
3.9   Social Investment Funds. The lessons learned from the Bank's experience in&#13;
financing over 30 social fund-type operations have influenced the design and operations&#13;
of the proposed project. During preparation, staff of the Project Preparation Management&#13;
Unit and the Chairman of the JSIF Advisory Committee visited two Central American&#13;
social investment funds. They also received significant technical assistance from social&#13;
fund managers and NGO beneficiaries who visited Jamaica and advice from World Bank&#13;
7 Planning Institute of Jamaica, 1995, A Preliminary Evaluation of Programs/Projects Aimed at&#13;
Alleviating the Impact on the Poor of Structural Adjustment, Liberalization and&#13;
Divestment/Privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
and Inter-American Development Bank staff and consultants experienced in the design&#13;
and implementation of social fund projects.&#13;
3.10  At the conceptual level, three main lessons have emerged. First, a social&#13;
investment fund should be considered as only one element of a much broader poverty&#13;
reduction strategy and not as a panacea for eradicating poverty. Second, although the&#13;
primary objective of a social fund needs to be clearly articulated, social funds can serve a&#13;
number of purposes simultaneously and can generate important ancillary benefits. For&#13;
example, immediate social assistance and temporary employment objectives are not&#13;
necessarily inconsistent with investments with a longer-term impact on poverty reduction.&#13;
Third, the lesson from experience as to whether social funds should be purely temporary,&#13;
short-term mechanisms is not yet conclusive. In general, flexibility and regard for the&#13;
country context are called for in determining the future direction of a social fund.&#13;
3.11  The main lessons learned in the design and operations of social funds which have&#13;
influenced the preparation and design of the proposed project include the importance of:&#13;
(a) institutional autonomy and freedom from political interference; (b) transparency and&#13;
accountability, which are furthered by a comprehensive operational manual, effective&#13;
management information system, frequent and standardized reporting, contracting of&#13;
independent evaluations and systematic feedback from project beneficiaries; (c) attracting&#13;
high-caliber, motivated staff by running a private sector-like operation and paying&#13;
competitive wages; (d) expedited procurement and disbursement procedures;&#13;
(e) mechanisms for sector coordination with line ministries to ensure complementary&#13;
objectives that are flexible enough not to compromise the independence and efficiency of&#13;
the social fund; (f) involvement of NGOs and local governments in the project cycle;&#13;
(g) using some monitorable, albeit simple, forms of targeting and promotional activities&#13;
to reach the poorest regions and targeted beneficiaries; (h) technically simple subproject&#13;
designs; (i) strong local participation during all phases of the subproject cycle to help&#13;
ensure sustainability; and (j) strong supervision mechanisms at both the managerial and&#13;
subproject levels.&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin of the Project&#13;
4.1   The preparation of the proposed project is an outcome of Government's&#13;
commitment to accelerate poverty reduction efforts. Discussions with the Bank were&#13;
initiated in September 1994 regarding the establishment of an efficient mechanism to&#13;
channel additional funding to small-scale, community-based projects in targeted areas. A&#13;
Japan Grant to finance project preparation was signed in March 1995, followed one week&#13;
later by the appointment of a Project Coordinator. Government is executing the Japan&#13;
Grant for the first time in Jamaica and preparation has been based in the Planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Institute of Jamaica to ensure maximum coordination with Government's poverty&#13;
reduction program and other donor/lender projects. After advertising through a private&#13;
sector selection services firm, a Government-appointed Advisory Committee approved&#13;
the hiring of five long-term consultants in September 1995 to prepare the project under&#13;
the assumption that, if they performed well, they would form the core staff of the JSIF&#13;
once established. A sixth consultant was hired in January 1996. The objective was to&#13;
recruit staff as early as possible in the project design phase to ensure maximum&#13;
"ownership", realism in design, and continuity between design and implementation.&#13;
B. Institutional and Operational Framework of the Social Investment Fund&#13;
4.2   Taking into account lessons from experience with other social funds and after a&#13;
review of institutional options in the Jamaican context, Cabinet in December 1995&#13;
approved the establishment of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund as a temporary,&#13;
autonomous public company incorporated under the Companies Act. The JSIF was&#13;
incorporated in February 1996. Memorandum and Articles of Association of the&#13;
company are in the project files.&#13;
4.3   As detailed in the Memorandum of Association, the objectives of the company&#13;
are: to mobilize and manage a pool of funds to be used in a program of poverty&#13;
alleviation consistent with the Government of Jamaica's national poverty reduction&#13;
strategy; to foster investment at the community level by providing funding for projects&#13;
aimed at stimulating integrated and sustainable development of poor communities; to&#13;
increase national institutional capacity to design, implement and manage small-scale,&#13;
community-based poverty alleviation projects; and to stimulate and encourage the&#13;
involvement of public and private organizations in the development of poor communities.&#13;
4.4   The Jamaica Social Investment Fund would act as a project financing agency:&#13;
promoting, appraising, financing and supervising projects in accordance with its&#13;
Operational Manual (see Annex A for Table of Contents). Subprojects would be&#13;
sponsored by eligible institutions, including central government ministries and agencies,&#13;
local governments, NGOs/CBOs, community groups and the private sector. Subproject&#13;
sponsors need not be legally registered entities. Subprojects would be executed by a&#13;
contractor (private sector firm or NGO/CBO) which would perform the works, provide&#13;
the equipment or carry out services financed under the subproject.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
4.5   The primary goal of the proposed project is to contribute to the reduction of&#13;
poverty and help create an environment for sustainable national development. More&#13;
specifically, the JSIF is designed to assist Government in responding to the needs of the&#13;
most vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing programs and institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
mechanisms by: (a) establishing an efficient, demand-driven and complementary&#13;
mechanism to deliver basic services and infrastructure to the poor; (b) mobilizing and&#13;
channeling additional resources to the areas of basic social and economic infrastructure&#13;
and social services; and (c) increasing national institutional capacity to identify, design,&#13;
implement, manage and sustain small-scale community-based projects.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
4.6   The project would consist of two components. The first component would&#13;
finance subprojects approved by the JSIF in the areas of social infrastructure, economic&#13;
infrastructure, social services and organizational strengthening as detailed below.&#13;
The second component would fund institutional support for the JSIF's establishment and&#13;
operations, including (i) salaries, vehicles, equipment and operating expenses; and&#13;
(ii) technical assistance and training to improve the JSIF's operational capacity and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
4.7    Component I: JSIF Subprojects (US$40.7 million). The JSIF would provide&#13;
grant financing for small-scale community-based subprojects designed to increase human&#13;
and social capital in the following categories: social infrastructure, economic&#13;
infrastructure, social services and organizational strengthening. All subprojects must&#13;
benefit poor communities, incorporate beneficiary participation at all stages of design and&#13;
implementation, include a contribution from the beneficiary group/subproject sponsor, be&#13;
consistent with national sectoral policies and cost a maximum of US$350,000 (see Annex&#13;
B for Eligibility Principles). To be eligible for financing, subprojects must be included&#13;
on the menu of eligible subprojects (see Annex C for Subproject Menu). Financing of&#13;
eligible subprojects would then be subject to technical appraisal by JSIF staff based on a&#13;
set of criteria developed for each type of subproject and detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual (see para. 5.13).&#13;
4.8   Social infrastructure (56% of the total number of subprojects), defined as&#13;
infrastructure related to the provision of social services, would include the rehabilitation,&#13;
expansion and construction and the equipping of schools, health centers, day care centers,&#13;
homes for children, the elderly and the disabled, community centers, training facilities&#13;
and sports facilities; and the construction and rehabilitation of public sanitary&#13;
conveniences (latrines, community showers), drains and canals, and community-based&#13;
water systems.&#13;
4.9   Economic infrastructure (11%), defined as infrastructure delivering economic&#13;
benefits, would include the rehabilitation and upgrading of parochial, feeder and urban&#13;
access roads and the construction and rehabilitation of community-based agroprocessing&#13;
facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4.10  Social services (20%) would include programs offering services in career&#13;
guidance and job placement, counseling (including conflict resolution and drug abuse)&#13;
and parenting and family life-education; and skills training to the productive sector and&#13;
the disabled.&#13;
4.11   Organizational strengthening (13%) would include technical assistance and&#13;
training to governmental and non-governmental institutions in participatory project&#13;
identification and prioritization and to subproject sponsors and executing agencies to&#13;
upgrade skills in preparation, implementation and management of small-scale&#13;
community-based projects.&#13;
4.12  During negotiations, it was agreed that the JSIF would only approve those&#13;
subprojects for which there are appraisal criteria satisfactory to the Bank as outlined in&#13;
the Operational Manual (para. 8.2(a)). It was further agreed that no change to the&#13;
subproject menu, appraisal criteria or the US$350,000 maximum subproject cost limit&#13;
would be made without prior Bank approval (para. 8.2(b)).&#13;
4.13  Component II: JSIF Institutional Support (US$9.3 million). This component&#13;
would include the financing of JSIF staff salaries, vehicles, office equipment and&#13;
operating expenses. JSIF's remuneration levels and recruitment procedures would be&#13;
sufficient to ensure high caliber staff. Due to the temporary nature of the JSIF and the&#13;
non-civil service status of its staff, the JSIF managerial and technical staff are considered&#13;
consultants to Government and are treated as such for purposes of the project. In addition&#13;
to common categories, operating expenses also includes the development and&#13;
implementation of a promotional strategy. JSIF personnel and operating expenditures are&#13;
fully incremental and declining financing by the Bank is not applicable. Overhead costs&#13;
(administrative and operating expenses) are estimated to be about 15 percent of the total&#13;
program over the four-year period. This percentage, although relatively high compared to&#13;
some social investment funds, reflects the high costs of personnel, rent and other&#13;
operating costs in Jamaica as well as the relatively small size of the JSIF. To help ensure&#13;
efficiency, overhead expenditures would be programmed and monitored as one of the&#13;
JSIF's institutional performance indicators and assessed during the annual management&#13;
audit (para. 6.16).&#13;
4.14  This component would also finance technical assistance and training to improve&#13;
JSIF's operational capacity and internal procedures in the areas of promotions, refinement&#13;
of the poverty map, poverty targeting, participatory needs assessment/project&#13;
identification, appraisal of social services and organizational strengthening subprojects,&#13;
gender, environmental procedures, impact monitoring and evaluation and management&#13;
information systems. A brief description of technical assistance and training activities is&#13;
presented in Annex D.&#13;
4.15   The proposed project has been scaled according to: (a) the expected operating&#13;
capacity of the JSIF; (b) the total amount of resources which the JSIF expects to disburse&#13;
over the four-year period; (c) expected demand, as estimated through a needs assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
exercise conducted during preparation; (d) the amount of resources available from&#13;
external donor and lender agencies; and (e) the availability of counterpart resources.&#13;
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
5.1   The proposed project would be implemented over the agreed four-year period.&#13;
Given the autonomous status of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund, it was agreed during&#13;
negotiations that a separate Subsidiary Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be&#13;
entered into between the Government of Jamaica and the JSIF (para.8.2(c)). Under this&#13;
agreement, the GOJ would make available on a non-reimbursable basis the proceeds of&#13;
the Bank loan to the JSIF which would have overall responsibility for project&#13;
implementation. As a condition of effectiveness, the Subsidiary Agreement, acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, would have been signed and entered into effect between Government and the&#13;
JSIF (para. 8.3(a)). A Memorandum of Understanding between the GOJ and the JSIF&#13;
provides that: (i) operations of the JSIF would be exempt from the ordinary requirements&#13;
of the Government procurement procedures up to a maximum of approximately&#13;
US$125,000; (ii) the JSIF would not be bound to pay its employees the salaries and&#13;
wages paid to civil servants by Government; and (iii) the JSIF be a signatory to any&#13;
special account into which the Bank or other multilateral and bilateral financing and&#13;
donor agencies will transfer funds (see Annex E for Memorandum of Understanding).&#13;
Prior to negotiations, the Memorandum of Understanding was signed and entered into&#13;
effect between Government and the JSIF (para. 8.1 (a)).&#13;
5.2   The JSIF would disburse funds on a grant basis for subprojects in the areas of&#13;
social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, social services and organizational&#13;
strengthening. The JSIF's operating procedures, including criteria and systems for&#13;
subproject promotion, appraisal, approval, contracting and monitoring, and the&#13;
administrative and financial rules are contained in the Operational Manual. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the JSIF submitted a revised version of its Operational Manual (para.&#13;
8.1 (c)), which incorporated changes suggested during appraisal. Finalization of the&#13;
Operational Manual, including detailed eligibility and appraisal criteria for all&#13;
subproject types, satisfactory to the Bank, and its approval by JSIF's Board of Directors&#13;
is a condition of effectiveness (para. 8. 3(b)). During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that no changes would be made to the approved manual without the prior&#13;
approval of the Bank (para. 8.2(d)).&#13;
B.    SIF Organizational Structure and Functions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
5.3   The Board of Directors of the JSIF is comprised of between seven and nine&#13;
members and the Managing Director of the JSIF. If the number of directors is seven, then&#13;
at least three would be selected from the private sector, and if there are nine directors then&#13;
at least four will be selected from the private sector. In either case, at least two of the&#13;
private sector representatives would be selected from NGOs and at least two of the public&#13;
sector representatives would be selected from social sector line ministries. Members of&#13;
Parliament and elected officials are ineligible for selection as directors. The Board terms&#13;
would be staggered with each Director having a three-year tenure and one-third of the&#13;
Board retiring each year, though eligible for reelection. The composition and staggering&#13;
of the Board of Directors is designed to help ensure transparency in the operations of the&#13;
JSIF, sufficient coordination with line ministries and continuity through political cycles.&#13;
Initial members of the Board of Directors were appointed by the Minister of Finance&#13;
through a consultative process prior to negotiations (para. 8.1 (d)).&#13;
5.4   The JSIF Board of Directors would guide and supervise the overall administration&#13;
and operations of the Fund and would have specific responsibility for approving its&#13;
Operational Manual, the annual budget and workplan, appointing senior management,&#13;
and approving subprojects unless otherwise delegated to a sub-committee of the Board or&#13;
JSIF management. The Managing Director would be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
operations of the JSIF in accordance with its operational policies and procedures.&#13;
5.5   The organizational structure, as depicted in Annex F, is based on the experience&#13;
of other social investment funds and takes into account Jamaica's institutional context.&#13;
The Managing Director would be supported by a Deputy Managing Director and two&#13;
departments: Operations and Finance and Administration. The Operations Department&#13;
would have four divisions mirroring the subproject cycle: Promotions, Appraisal,&#13;
Contracting and Supervision. The Finance and Administration Department would have&#13;
two divisions: Accounts and Administration and Human Resources. The Board,&#13;
Managing Director and departments would be supported by three units: Internal Audit&#13;
and Evaluation, Legal Advisory, and Management Information Systems.&#13;
5.6   Given the scale of the proposed operation, it is estimated that at the height of its&#13;
operations the JSIF would be staffed by approximately 45-50 managerial, technical and&#13;
support staff. An Acting Managing Director as well as the heads of the Operations and&#13;
Finance and Administration Departments, Contracting/Supervision Division and Legal&#13;
Advisory and MIS Units have already been hired. Depending on demand and need, small&#13;
regional offices may be opened in order to improve promotions and supervision of&#13;
subprojects. In addition to is own staff, the JSIF would sub-contract some supervision&#13;
tasks and technical services. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the JSIF's&#13;
management level positions would be staffed satisfactorily to the Bank (para. 8.2(e)).8 As&#13;
8 Positions requiring Bank prior review are: Managing Director; Deputy Managing Director; Manager,&#13;
Operations Department; Manager, Finance and Administration Department; Head, Internal Audit and&#13;
Evaluation Unit; Head, Management Information Systems Unit; Head, Legal Advisory Unit; Head,&#13;
Human Resources Division; and Head, Promotions Division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
a condition of effectiveness, the JSIF wouldfill specified staff and management positions&#13;
(para. 8.3(c)).9&#13;
C. Subproject Cycle&#13;
5.7    The stages of the JSIF subproject cycle are typical of successful social investment&#13;
funds elsewhere and would involve: subproject promotion, identification and&#13;
preparation; appraisal and approval; contracting, execution and supervision; and&#13;
completion. A schematic diagram of the subproject cycle is presented in Annex G.&#13;
Project Promotion, Identification and Preparation&#13;
5.8    The Jamaica Social Investment Fund would undertake promotional strategies,&#13;
using national media, community meetings and regional workshops, to ensure effective&#13;
coverage across the island. The promotions strategy is designed to increase awareness&#13;
among potential subproject participants of the types of subprojects supported by the&#13;
Fund, the eligibility and selection criteria and the general guidelines and procedures&#13;
governing access to Fund resources, including the centrality of community participation&#13;
throughout the subproject cycle. The promotions strategy would be developed and&#13;
undertaken by the Promotions Division and would involve:&#13;
a) the preparation and wide dissemination of informational materials to line ministries,&#13;
local governments, NGOs/CBOs and communities and the private sector outlining&#13;
eligibility principles (Annex B), the subproject menu and eligibility criteria (Annex&#13;
C), subproject application forms, and guidelines to facilitate the elaboration of&#13;
subproject ideas into structured proposals;&#13;
b) an initial campaign targeted toward organizations with experience and capacity to&#13;
stimulate quality applications for subprojects which can be quickly financed to&#13;
produce a demonstration effect and build JSIF credibility;&#13;
c) a series of workshops in priority regions with limited capacity in order to train local&#13;
institutions in the identification and preparation of subproject proposals;&#13;
d) site visits of JSIF promotions staff to the poorest and most difficult to access&#13;
communities to help identify their needs using participatory techniques. The poverty&#13;
map, described below, combined with information gathered from field organizations&#13;
and local research would be used to geographically target the promotions strategy to&#13;
the poorest communities.&#13;
9JSIF management and staff positions to be filled prior to effectiveness are: Managing Director; Manager,&#13;
Operations Department; Manager, Finance and Administration Department; Head, Management&#13;
Information Systems Unit; Head, Legal Advisory Unit; Head, Human Resources Division; and Head,&#13;
Promotions Division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
During negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank would review the effectiveness of the&#13;
draft promotions strategy six months after effectiveness of the loan (para. 8.2(f)).&#13;
5.9   To establish the need for the proposed investment as well as to build community&#13;
cohesion and ownership, all subprojects would be identified using participatory&#13;
techniques to sharpen the community focus on its needs and priorities. Project&#13;
identification would be undertaken in conjunction with or by line ministries,&#13;
Government's Social Development Commission, Parish Councils and NGOs/CBOs. The&#13;
JSIF would provide technical assistance and training to these organizations in the use of&#13;
participatory identification techniques and gradually reduce its direct involvement in the&#13;
process. Trained community facilitators would assist in preparation of subproject&#13;
proposals.&#13;
5.10  Staff of the Promotions Division would undertake the initial screening of&#13;
subproject proposals for consistency with the JSIF's eligibility principles and subproject&#13;
eligibility criteria, which have been developed to conform with sector policies and norms.&#13;
When appropriate, profiles of eligible subprojects would be submitted to the relevant line&#13;
ministry for its no-objection to further processing of the subproject. If a ministry's no-&#13;
objection is not received within five working days, the subproject would be considered&#13;
cleared for appraisal.&#13;
5.11  Targeting. One of the principal objectives of the JSIF is to reach regions and&#13;
vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing delivery mechanisms. To help&#13;
ensure that benefits reach the intended population, the JSIF would use various targeting&#13;
mechanisms within stages of the subproject cycle along with a poverty map to identify&#13;
and focus activities in priority areas and prevent leakage of benefits to the wealthier&#13;
regions. Within the subproject cycle, the types of subprojects eligible for financing by&#13;
the JSIF, including primary education and health care facilities, are likely to concentrate&#13;
benefits among the poor. As described above, project promotion would target the poorest&#13;
regions with limited capacity in order to train local institutions in subproject preparation.&#13;
Technical and other appraisal criteria are being designed with a view towards ensuring&#13;
the involvement of the targeted population.&#13;
5.12  Poverty Map. A poverty map completed in January 1996 by the Social Policy&#13;
Analysis Unit of the Planning Institute of Jamaica with JSIF-financed local technical&#13;
assistance would serve as the principal instrument for geographical poverty targeting.&#13;
The poverty mapping exercise involved three main activities: (i) the identification of&#13;
communities across Jamaica; (ii) the selection of indicators, by a technical advisory&#13;
committee, to be used to determine the deprivation status of these communities; and (iii)&#13;
the development of a methodology to measure the relative deprivation status of these&#13;
communities. The 5,074 Census Enumeration Districts were amalgamated to 506&#13;
communities. Using the 1991 Population Census which is the only data set providing&#13;
complete coverage of the island, the indicators selected were: percentage of households&#13;
without piped water into their dwelling; percentage of households without exclusive use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
of toilet facilities; percentage of labor force 15-29 years unemployed; and percentage of&#13;
age group 14-29 with primary school education only. The 506 communities were then&#13;
ranked based on these indicators and divided into quartiles. During negotiations, the&#13;
JSIF provided the following indicative targets; an estimated 40 percent of the resources&#13;
would go to the poorest quartile (with 18 percent of the population), 30 percent to the&#13;
second quartile (with 30 percent of the population), 20 percent to the third quartile (with&#13;
28 percent of the population) and 10 percent to the least poor quartile (with 24 of the&#13;
population) (para. 8.2(g)). Actual distribution of resources will be compared to these&#13;
targets and additional measures taken, if required, to ensure resources reach the intended&#13;
beneficiaries. The proposed project would finance, if necessary, technical assistance to&#13;
refine the poverty map and JSIF's targeting strategy based on experience.&#13;
Appraisal&#13;
5.13   Staff of the Appraisal Division would undertake a preliminary desk analysis to&#13;
confirm that the subproject is consistent with JSIF eligibility principles, the subproject&#13;
menu and criteria and that required documentation is complete. This analysis would be&#13;
followed by a site visit conducted with a representative of the subproject sponsor, as well&#13;
as an official of the relevant line ministry or Parish Council. Information contained in the&#13;
project proposal and confirmed or supplemented during the site visit would provide the&#13;
basis for appraisal according to the following criteria, as specified in the JSIF's&#13;
Operational Manual:&#13;
a) Technical criteria for subproject appraisal would be developed for each type of&#13;
subproject based on existing technical standards and norms to be provided by the&#13;
relevant line ministries and other government entities to ensure sectoral coherence&#13;
and compatibility. Technical appraisal would confirm that the project design and&#13;
specifications conform to these norms. It would also ensure that infrastructure,&#13;
equipment and other inputs are consistent in scale, quality, cost and content with the&#13;
proposed activities of the subproject and that implementation is technically feasible.&#13;
In the case of service projects, the technical criteria will assess the content and the&#13;
relevance to the community of the service being provided.&#13;
b) Financial and economic analysis would assess the estimated cost of each component&#13;
of the subproject cost schedule against unit costs developed by the JSIF providing&#13;
explanations for any significant variances. Where applicable, economic rates of&#13;
return would be calculated. For subprojects where quantitative economic analysis is&#13;
not applicable, cost-effectiveness of the subproject would be calculated. The source&#13;
of financing for the subproject would be assessed, counterpart contributions&#13;
confirmed and guarantees sought for the financing of recurrent costs. Where line&#13;
ministries are responsible for recurrent costs, they would be requested to assure funds&#13;
would be available.&#13;
c) Social analysis would confirm the identity of the potential beneficiaries and assess&#13;
their degree of participation in the identification and preparation of the subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
proposal. Confirmation of the willingness and ability of the community and/or&#13;
sponsor to participate in supervision of subproject implementation and contribute to&#13;
the sustainability of the subproject output after implementation would also be sought.&#13;
Social analysis would also include an assessment of the likely impact of the project,&#13;
during and after implementation, on the communities with particular reference to&#13;
differential impacts by gender. Special emphasis would be placed on the impact of&#13;
proposed subprojects on youth and women and on social cohesion, in general.&#13;
d) Institutional and sustainability analysis, particularly when the subproject sponsor&#13;
also serves as executor, would assess the role of the organization in building&#13;
community cohesion as well as its capacity to implement the project. Sustainability&#13;
analysis would assess the commitment, in monetary as well as personnel terms, to the&#13;
sustainability of the project output. In the case of infrastructure projects, essential&#13;
maintenance activities would be identified and assessments conducted to determine&#13;
the institutional capabilities to undertake essential maintenance. Where training for&#13;
maintenance is considered necessary, it will be identified through this assessment.&#13;
e) Environmental analysis would be undertaken on subprojects with potential&#13;
environmental impact although, given the size and nature of subprojects, no&#13;
significant negative environmental impacts are anticipated. The environmental&#13;
assessment would identify measures for mitigation of minor adverse environmental&#13;
impacts or critical environmental problems requiring further investigation.&#13;
Approval and Bank Review&#13;
5.14  An appraisal report would be prepared for each subproject, according to a pre-&#13;
designed format, and reviewed at different levels in the organization. All subproject&#13;
proposals and appraisal reports would be reviewed by the Management Committee of the&#13;
JSIF for recommendation to the Board of Directors. Authority to approve, reject or&#13;
request revision and resubmission of all subprojects would rest with the Board which&#13;
would meet monthly or more frequently if necessary. The Board may delegate this&#13;
authority to an Executive Committee which would meet at least every two weeks or, in&#13;
the case of small contracts, to the JSIF Management Committee. The Executive&#13;
Committee would include at least one NGO and one private sector representative. The&#13;
JSIF Management Committee is comprised of the Managing Director, the Directors of the&#13;
Operations and Finance and Administration Departments and the heads of the Internal&#13;
Audit and Evaluation, Legal Advisory and MIS Units. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached that subproject approval thresholds for the Board's Executive Committee&#13;
and the JSIF's Management Committee would be established by the Board and included&#13;
in the Operational Manual (para. 8.2(h)).&#13;
5.15  Once approved, subproject proposals would be submitted for clearance from&#13;
external financing sources when required. The Bank would review the first five&#13;
subprojects of each subproject category (i.e., social infrastructure, economic&#13;
infrastructure, social services and organizational strengthening) prior to contracting to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
ensure adherence to eligibility and appraisal criteria. After that, given the nature, size and&#13;
estimated number of subprojects and demands on Bank supervision, the following&#13;
procedures would apply to Bank-financed subprojects: (i) for civil works contracts over&#13;
US$200,000, equipment contracts over US$100,000, and services and sponsor-executed&#13;
contracts over US$25,000, prior review by the Bank would be required; and (ii) for&#13;
subprojects under these limits, the Bank would carry out a random ex post review, based&#13;
on summary project data sheets acceptable to the Bank and bidding documents and&#13;
contracts to be retained by the JSIF. During negotiations, these subproject review&#13;
arrangements were confirmed with Government (para 8.2(i)).&#13;
Contracting, Execution and Supervision&#13;
5.16  Upon approval of a subproject request, an agreement would be signed between the&#13;
subproject sponsor and the JSIF delineating the responsibilities of both parties. The&#13;
agreement would authorize the JSIF, on behalf of the subproject sponsor, to proceed with&#13;
the selection of an executing agency/contractor in accordance with Bank procedures.&#13;
Once all pre-contractual conditions are satisfied, the JSIF would enter into a contract with&#13;
the executing agency/contractor. The nature of the executing agency/contractor would&#13;
vary by type of subproject. In the case of civil works projects, a local private sector&#13;
contractor would normally be hired to carry out the work. For social services projects,&#13;
the executing agency/contractor could be an NGO. While in most cases there will be&#13;
three different parties involved in a subproject - the JSIF, the sponsor and the executing&#13;
agency/contractor - in some cases an NGO might act as both the sponsor and the&#13;
executing agency/contractor. Prior to negotiations, the JSIF submitted a draft Sponsor&#13;
Agreement (para. 8.1 (e)). During negotiations, it was agreed that the Sponsor&#13;
Agreement and standard contract would be finalized prior to loan effectiveness and&#13;
included in the Operational Manual (para. 8.2(j)).&#13;
5.17  Executing agencies/contractors would present appropriate guarantees, including&#13;
performance bonds in the case of private sector contractors carrying out civil works,&#13;
under guidelines included in the Operational Manual. Upon presentation of appropriate&#13;
guarantees, JSIF would disburse directly to the contractor a mobilization advance&#13;
followed by regular disbursements based on work completed and confirmed during JSIF&#13;
site supervision visits. To increase controls on subproject execution, contingencies would&#13;
not be included in the subproject budgets. Although changes in standard subproject costs&#13;
are not expected given the accuracy and regular updating of the unit cost database, cost&#13;
adjustments would be handled through separate requests for a change in budget.&#13;
5.18  Subproject execution would be supervised by staff of the JSIF's Supervision&#13;
Division and, for infrastructure subprojects, by external on-site technical supervisors&#13;
contracted by the JSIF and financed as part of the subproject cost. Terms of reference&#13;
and standard contracts for external supervisors will be included in the Operational&#13;
Manual. The beneficiary group or project sponsor would also monitor the quality of&#13;
works, goods or services and general performance of the contractor. Requests for&#13;
disbursements would be made upon verification of work completed by both the external&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
supervisor and the beneficiary group or project sponsor. JSIF supervisors would visit the&#13;
subproject site periodically to inspect the progress of the work, assess general contractor&#13;
performance and authorize requested disbursements. In addition, local consultants would&#13;
be contracted to perform physical audits on a random sample of subprojects to evaluate&#13;
their technical quality and operational and maintenance cost coverage and to evaluate the&#13;
adequacy of JSIF's appraisal and supervision systems (para. 6.17).&#13;
Project Completion&#13;
5.19  The project completion stage involves certification and handover of works&#13;
completed, final payments and preparation of a subproject completion report. The&#13;
subproject completion report, to be generated by the Management Information System&#13;
(para. 5.20), would evaluate contractor performance, subproject processing time and cost.&#13;
This information would be incorporated in subsequent project planning and&#13;
implementation activities.&#13;
D. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.20 Management Information System. The Jamaica Social Investment Fund would&#13;
design and install a computerized Management Information System (MIS) to monitor the&#13;
subproject cycle and the performance of the JSIF in relation to programmed targets. The&#13;
MIS, which would be developed with software and technical assistance from other social&#13;
funds, would consist of: (i) a subproject database that would enable the management and&#13;
staff of the JSIF to monitor and track subprojects through all stages of the subproject&#13;
cycle and analyze the portfolio of the JSIF in relation to its objectives and sectoral and&#13;
poverty-level allocation targets; (ii) a budgeting and supervision control system to&#13;
facilitate the tracking of subproject budgets, resource flows and physical progress of&#13;
projects, and (iii) a geographical information system for database queries and visual&#13;
geographical representation of the Fund's investments and activities.&#13;
5.21  The MIS would allow management to improve planning and operations of the&#13;
JSIF; inform interested parties on the progress of subprojects; and report on the numbers&#13;
and locations of beneficiaries, and the nature and extent of benefits received. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, the Management Information System, acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
would be operational (para. 8.2(d)).&#13;
5.22  Performance Indicators. An important function of the MIS would be to produce&#13;
reports on a comprehensive series of performance indicators designed to measure the&#13;
performance of the JSIF. This capability is particularly important given the need to&#13;
justify the creation of the JSIF as a new and exceptional institution. Draft indicators&#13;
measuring the Fund's capacity, efficiency, quality and impact are detailed in Annex H.&#13;
During negotiations, it was agreed that a subset of these indicators would be monitored&#13;
by the Bank (para. 8.2(k)). As a condition of effectiveness, the JSIF wouldfurnish to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Bankperformance targets, satisfactory to the Bank, for the first year ofproject&#13;
implementation (para. 8.3(e)). Annual performance targets would be reviewed and&#13;
revised annually as part of JSIF's annual review exercise.&#13;
5.23  Impact Evaluation. In order to determine the social and economic impact, assess&#13;
the participatory aspects, ensure technical quality and calculate the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
JSIF-financed interventions, audits, assessments and evaluations would be contracted&#13;
externally for the following activities: (a) physical audits to assess the technical quality&#13;
of subprojects (para. 5.18); (b) beneficiary assessments to receive direct, unbiased and&#13;
constructive feedback from JSIF's target population; and (c) ex-post evaluations to&#13;
determine impact in terms of access to services and improvements in the standard of&#13;
living of JSIF beneficiaries and institution building of other government agencies and&#13;
project sponsors. The results of these evaluations would be used by JSIF management to&#13;
adjust policies and procedures in order to achieve the JSIF's objectives. An evaluation&#13;
and supervision plan is presented in Annex I.&#13;
E. Reporting and Supervision&#13;
5.24  The following reporting requirements would apply to the proposed project:&#13;
(i) The JSIF would submit to the Bank standard Monthly Progress Reports, according to&#13;
an agreed format, and based on information from the Management Information System;&#13;
(ii) The JSIF would prepare an Annual Report to be approved by its Board of Directors&#13;
and submitted to the Bank, no later than August 31 of the following year. Annual&#13;
Reports would contain key performance indicators of JSIF, a review of technical&#13;
assistance and training efforts, the results of any monitoring and impact evaluation&#13;
studies, and the implementation of recommendations from the external management,&#13;
financial and technical audits.&#13;
(iii) Upon completing this report, the JSIF, in collaboration with the Bank and other co-&#13;
financiers, would undertake an Annual Portfolio Review to be held no later than&#13;
September 30 of every year (beginning in 1997). This review would include an&#13;
assessment of performance indicators, subprojects by type and location, completion&#13;
schedule and costs, cash-flow projections, recurrent and maintenance cost coverage,&#13;
operational procedures, including environmental assessment procedures, and the&#13;
availability of Govermnent counterpart funds. The input of all stakeholders would be&#13;
sought during the review.&#13;
(iv) No later than six months after the project closing date, JSIF would submit a final&#13;
report and evaluation of the outcome of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Attempts would be made to ensure that report formats meet the needs of all JSIF donors&#13;
to the maximum extent feasible.&#13;
5.25 Mid-Term Review. The Bank, JSIF, relevant Government agencies and other&#13;
external financing agencies would conduct a joint Mid-Term Review to evaluate the&#13;
performance of the JSIF. This exercise would be scheduled to occur promptly after&#13;
US$7.5 million of the Bank loan for the financing of subprojects is disbursed or no later&#13;
than 24 months after the date of effectiveness of the loan. The Mid-Term Review is&#13;
designed to provide an opportunity to evaluate the experience of the JSIF both at an&#13;
operational level and in the context of Government's National Poverty Program to&#13;
determine its optimal duration and scope beyond the life of the project. At the end of the&#13;
review, a Mid-Term Review Report would be submitted to the Bank highlighting any&#13;
major problems, issues and bottlenecks identified during the review process and the&#13;
proposals for resolving them and fulfilling the project objectives. During negotiations,&#13;
Government's agreement to these reporting and review requirements was obtained (para.&#13;
8.2(1) and (m)).&#13;
5.26  Bank Supervision. Due to the demand-driven nature of JSIF, the large number&#13;
of subprojects to be reviewed, the newness of the institution and the importance of&#13;
transparency, intensive supervision is required by the Bank. An estimated 25 staff weeks&#13;
would be required annually, 20 from the Resident Mission in Kingston and 5 from&#13;
Headquarters, costing a total of approximately US$50,000. Supervision tasks would&#13;
include visits to subprojects in execution, ex-ante and ex-post subproject reviews,&#13;
procurement reviews and monitoring of monthly performance reports. In order to reduce&#13;
the costs of supervision, joint supervision missions would be conducted with other&#13;
external co-financiers and the feasibility of contracting local consultants to review&#13;
selected aspects of JSIF's operations would be explored.&#13;
F. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.27  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.&#13;
Given the size and nature of subprojects, no significant negative environmental impacts&#13;
are anticipated and no resettlement is envisioned. Environmental impact assessments&#13;
would be carried out as part of the subproject appraisal process and technical assistance&#13;
would be provided to the JSIF to develop environmental assessment policies and&#13;
procedures. If adverse impacts are foreseen on a subproject, necessary mitigating&#13;
measures, if not already outlined, would be incorporated into the subproject design at&#13;
appraisal. The adequacy of JSIF's environmental procedures would be assessed by the&#13;
Bank as part of the Annual Portfolio Review.&#13;
&#13;

6. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
6.1    Project Costs. The total project cost, expressed in April 1996 prices, is estimated&#13;
at US$50 million, net of taxes and duties. The foreign exchange content amounts to US$&#13;
18.2 million, representing about 36 percent of total project cost. A summary of project&#13;
costs by component is shown in Table 6.1 with a detailed cost table provided in Annex J.&#13;

6.2    A total of US$40.7 million, or 81 percent, of the total project cost is allocated to&#13;
finance subprojects. The share of funds assigned to each type of subproject is indicative,&#13;
with revisions possible based on implementation experience. Given the fact that the JSIF&#13;
is an intermediary and is demand-driven by nature, the actual breakdown will depend on&#13;
demand and operational experience. No contingencies have been included for&#13;
subprojects as any increase in individual subproject costs would be administered through&#13;
change orders (para. 5.17) and absorbed by the subproject budget, resulting in a reduction&#13;
of the number of subprojects executed. Institutional support to the JSIF (excluding&#13;
technical assistance and training) accounts for US$7.9 million or 16 percent of total&#13;
project cost. Costs of technical assistance and training for the JSIF are estimated at&#13;
US$1.4 million for the project. Since the procurement of most of the vehicles and&#13;
equipment will take place during the first year of the project, no contingencies have been&#13;
provided for that category.&#13;
6.3    Financing Plan. The proposed loan of US$20 million would finance 40 percent&#13;
of total project cost over the projected four-year implementation period. The financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
plan is shown in Table 6.2. Government will make available approximately US$2.5&#13;
million in local currency from counterpart funds generated through the European Union&#13;
General Import Program to assist in establishing the JSIF and facilitate rapid&#13;
consideration of subprojects. Government would commit an additional US$7.5 million&#13;
over the course of the project for a total of US$ 10 million or 20 percent of total project&#13;
cost. Subproject beneficiaries and sponsors would provide an estimated 12 percent of the&#13;
total cost of subprojects, although this percentage would vary depending on the type of&#13;
subproject, the resources available from the sponsoring agency and the income-level of&#13;
the beneficiary community. Beneficiaries and sponsors would provide the bulk of their&#13;
contribution in the form of donated labor and local materials, and project preparation and&#13;
supervision services. During negotiations, Government provided assurances on the&#13;
provision of the specified amount of government counterpart financing each year and&#13;
agreed that beneficiaries/sponsors would be obligated by JSIF to contribute a minimum&#13;
percentage of subproject cost (para 8.2(n) and (o)). As a condition of effectiveness,&#13;
Government willfurnish to the Bank evidence of the availability of the minimum&#13;
counterpartfundsfor Fiscal Year 1996/97 (para. 8.3(f)). Additional identified co-&#13;
financing includes a grant of approximately US$3 million recently approved by the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands to be managed by the World Bank under a Trust Fund&#13;
arrangement. The Inter-American Development Bank is preparing a US$10 million loan&#13;
for approval by December, 1996. The British Development Division in the Caribbean&#13;
intends to provide long-term technical assistance to the JSIF, particularly in the areas of&#13;
participatory community needs assessment/project identification and gender analysis. The&#13;
European Union has expressed interest in providing additional grant resources pending an&#13;
initial assessment of the Fund's operations. It was agreed with the JSIF and major&#13;
identified co-financiers during appraisal that cross-default clauses between the Bank's&#13;
legal documents and cofinancing agreements would not be necessary. Any eventual&#13;
shortfall in fund-raising would reduce the ultimate number of subprojects to be financed&#13;
but would not endanger JSIF's functioning nor the benefits accrued from Bank-funded&#13;
JSIF projects. The overall financing share of JSIF's overhead expenses would be&#13;
apportioned 50:25:25 among the Bank, the IDB and Government.&#13;

6.4   Project preparation activities have been expedited by a grant from the Japanese&#13;
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund of 51.4 million yen (approximately&#13;
US$485,000) signed in March 1995. This grant money was used to finance the&#13;
establishment and operations of the Project Preparation Management Unit (PPMU) and&#13;
technical assistance to the PPMU to design the JSIF. Technical assistance is also being&#13;
provided by the IDB. Out of the proposed loan, up to a maximum of US$1 million&#13;
equivalent would be available for retroactive financing to finance pilot subprojects,&#13;
salaries, administrative overhead and technical assistance between June 1, 1996 and loan&#13;
effectiveness. This trial implementation period would allow the JSIF to test and refine its&#13;
operational procedures based on processing and financing a set of pilot subprojects.&#13;
B.   Procurement&#13;
6.5   Procurement of civil works, goods and services financed by the Bank will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines (see Annex K for a summary matrix of&#13;
procurement and disbursement methods). The Bank and Government have agreed that all&#13;
co-financiers should accept the common set of procurement procedures detailed in the&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
6.6   Civil Works. No international competitive bidding is expected under the&#13;
proposed project given the small size of subproject contracts: the maximum subproject&#13;
cost is US$350,000 with average subproject cost estimated at about US$50,000. National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, acceptable to the Bank, would apply to civil&#13;
works contracts valued between US$100,000 and US$350,000. Approximately US$4&#13;
million of civil works contracts to be financed by the Bank is expected to be awarded&#13;
through NCB, representing 38 percent of the civil works subproject amount. Minor&#13;
works contracts, estimated to cost less than US$100,000, up to an expected total&#13;
aggregate amount of US$6 million to be financed by the Bank, will be procured under&#13;
lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified contractors in response to written invitation. A unit cost database maintained by&#13;
the JSIF would be used to check the competitiveness of quotes under this procedure. In&#13;
exceptional circumstances detailed in the Operational Manual, direct contracting would&#13;
apply to some contracts below US$25,000, with a maximum contract value per&#13;
subproject of US$25,000. Direct contracting would be allowed up to a total aggregate&#13;
amount of US$430,000. Packaging groups of subprojects is unlikely to be possible&#13;
except in circumstances in which a sponsoring agency has applied for a package of&#13;
investments.&#13;
6.7   Equipment and Goods. Goods and equipment to be purchased under the&#13;
project's Institutional Support Component include vehicles, computers, office equipment&#13;
and furniture. Under the Subproject Component, they include furniture, basic equipment&#13;
and supplies for schools, health clinics and other facilities. Packages of goods and&#13;
equipment above US$150,000, where international competitive bidding procedure would&#13;
apply, are not anticipated. For goods and equipment costing more than US$25,000 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
less than US$150,000, National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank would apply. Under the subproject component, an anticipated US$1.6 million of&#13;
equipment to be financed by the Bank is expected to be purchased under NCB. For&#13;
procurement of goods and equipment costing US$25,000 or less under both components,&#13;
international or local shopping procedures would apply, with an estimated aggregate&#13;
amount of US$40,000 for the institutional support component and US$1.2 million for&#13;
subprojects. In exceptional circumstances detailed in the Operational Manual, direct&#13;
contracting would apply to some contracts below US$2,000, with a maximum contract&#13;
value per subproject of US$2,000. Direct contracting would be allowed up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$90,000. Under the institutional support component, Limited&#13;
International Bidding acceptable to the Bank would apply to vehicles and computer&#13;
equipment (with an estimated total value of US$200,000) whereby the JSIF would solicit&#13;
bids from all international suppliers with service facilities in Jamaica.&#13;
6.8   The main control on direct contracting would be JSIF's strict adherence to the&#13;
costs provided in the unit cost system. During negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
the JSIF would update the unit cost system at least every six months and submit updated&#13;
information to the Bank for ex post review (para.8.2(p)). All cost estimates for&#13;
subprojects would have to fall within the cost limits calculated using the database. This&#13;
system has proved an effective tool for controlling subproject costs and procurement in&#13;
other social funds. The JSIF would need to demonstrate that the costs of the subprojects&#13;
are competitive with similar projects, particularly those financed under other World Bank&#13;
operations. As an additional safeguard, JSIF would keep a database on the number,&#13;
amount and location of subprojects implemented by individual contractors and would&#13;
limit the total value of contracts that can be awarded to any one contractor under direct&#13;
contracting to US$200,000 for civil works projects. These direct contracting guidelines&#13;
would be agreed upon and included in the Operational Manual. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that no change can be made to: (i) the maximum contract values&#13;
per subproject of US$25,000 for civil works and US$2,000 for goods that can be awarded&#13;
through direct contracting and (ii) the US$200,000 ceiling amount awarded to any one&#13;
contractor for civil works projects through direct contracting procedures within the life of&#13;
the project without prior Bank approval (para.8.2(b))&#13;
6.9   Consultant Services and Training. A total of approximately US$5.8 million&#13;
(institutional support and subprojects) to be financed by the Bank (and the Netherlands&#13;
Government under a Trust Fund arrangement) would be allocated to consultant services&#13;
and training under the project. The selection and appointment of consultants would be&#13;
done in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (1981),&#13;
including the contracting of JSIF managerial and technical personnel.&#13;
6.10  Categories Not Applicable to Procurement Arrangements. Standard&#13;
procurement arrangements would not apply to JSIF operating expenses (administrative&#13;
staff salaries, rent, utilities, travel and minor office supplies). Social assistance&#13;
subprojects sponsored and executed by the same NGO would also not be governed by&#13;
standard procurement procedures.&#13;

dIncludes comparison of three quotations for subprojects valued under US$ 100,000 (aggregate amount&#13;
US$6 million) and direct contracting for some subprojects valued under US$25,000 (aggregate amount&#13;
US$430,000).&#13;
e Includes local shopping for subprojects valued under US$25,000 (aggregate amount US$1.2 million) and&#13;
direct contracting for some subproject valued under US$2,000 (aggregate amount US$90,000).&#13;
fIncludes services subprojects procured following Bank guidelines for consultant services and sponsor-&#13;
executed subprojects which would not be covered by Bank procurement guidelines (estimated at US$I&#13;
million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
6.11  Bank Review. Bank review procedures of subproject approvals to ensure&#13;
compliance with agreed procurement arrangements are provided in para. 5.15. Prior&#13;
Bank review would also be required for contracts for all vehicles and equipment&#13;
purchased for the JSIF. Prior Bank review would be required for all contracts for the&#13;
employment of consultant firms above US$100,000 and for the employment of individual&#13;
consultants above US$50,000 under the JSIF Institutional Support Component. In&#13;
addition, prior review would be required for JSIF management-level positions. These&#13;
arrangements would result in prior review by the Bank of an estimated 25 percent of the&#13;
value of all Bank-financed contracts. Measures to ensure effective operations and&#13;
compliance with procurement arrangements include: on-site technical supervisors&#13;
contracted by the JSIF (para. 5.17); physical technical audits conducted on a random&#13;
sample of subprojects (paras. 5.18 and 6.17); annual financial and management audits&#13;
(para. 6.16) and application of the unit cost system (para. 6.8).&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
6.12  The proposed World Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of five years.&#13;
Project activities are expected to be completed by September 30, 2000 (completion date)&#13;
with disbursements completed by March 31, 2001 (closing date). A disbursement profile&#13;
is provided in Annex L. Although this profile is shorter than for other LAC social sector&#13;
projects, it is in line with the Bank's experience with social funds and is based on&#13;
anticipated demand and appraised institutional capacity.&#13;
Table 6.4: Estimated IBRD Disbursement&#13;
FY1997     FY1998       FY1999      FY2000      FY2001&#13;

6.13  Disbursements would be made against the following categories of expenditures:&#13;
(a) JSIF subproject grants: 100 percent of disbursements on subprojects approved&#13;
according to SIF subproject eligibility and appraisal criteria; (b) JSIF personnel and&#13;
operating costs: 100 percent of eligible expenditures (net of taxes); (c) JSIF vehicles&#13;
and equipment: 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory costs) and 80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally;&#13;
and (d) JSIF technical assistance and training: 100 percent of expenditures (net of&#13;
taxes).&#13;
6.14  Documentation of Expenditure. For civil works US$200,000 or less, equipment&#13;
US$100,000, services and sponsor-executed subprojects under US$25,000, JSIF&#13;
administrative expenditures and contracts for JSIF fixed-term non-managerial staff,&#13;
withdrawal applications would be supported by Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). For&#13;
civil works over US$200,000, equipment over US$100,000, services and sponsor-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
executed subprojects US$25,000 or more and JSIF consultant and technical assistance&#13;
contracts, withdrawal applications would be supported by full documentation.&#13;
Supporting documentation for all SOEs would be maintained by the JSIF and made&#13;
available for review by Bank staff. Payment for expenditures made on subprojects would&#13;
be requested only for those subprojects approved in accordance with procedures detailed&#13;
in the Operational Manual and for which the corresponding Sponsor Agreement has been&#13;
signed. A Special Account in US Dollars, with an authorized allocation of US$1.0&#13;
million, equivalent to an estimated four months of average disbursement, will be&#13;
established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. During the start of the project&#13;
the Government may request up to US$500,000 as an initial deposit to the Special&#13;
Account. After disbursement and commitments from the loan account have reached&#13;
US$2.0 million, the Government may request the balance of the authorized allocation.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement to these disbursement arrangements was reached with&#13;
Government (para. 8.2(q)). In accordance with the provision for retroactive financing&#13;
(see para. 6.4), withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1 million, may be&#13;
made on account of payments for expenditures under both components between June 1,&#13;
1996 and loan effectiveness.&#13;
D. Accounts and Auditing&#13;
6.15  The JSIF's Finance and Administration Department would be responsible for the&#13;
overall financial management of the Fund. It would develop and implement a computer-&#13;
based management information and accounting system which would enable JSIF to&#13;
provide quick and reliable financial information on subprojects and administrative&#13;
expenses, including tracking expenditures by financing source. JSIF would also hire an&#13;
Internal Auditor who would be responsible for conducting specific operational and&#13;
administrative audits for the Board. These audit reports would be used as management&#13;
tools to identify and take corrective actions if necessary to ensure the correct uses of&#13;
funds. The Government's Auditor General would also retain the right to audit the JSIF.&#13;
6.16  External financial and management audits would be performed on an annual&#13;
basis through the contracting of independent, private auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The external audits would cover all project accounts, the Special Account and all&#13;
disbursement requests made against Statements of Expenditures. During appraisal, draft&#13;
terms of reference for the external financial audits was submitted and is attached as&#13;
Annex M. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that audits would be&#13;
conducted by an independent private auditor acceptable to the Bank and would follow&#13;
terms of reference in accordance with appropriate auditing standards, as approved by the&#13;
Bank; and that the JSIF on behalf of Government would send a copy of the external audit&#13;
report to the Bank within six months after the close of each fiscal year (para. 8.2(r)). The&#13;
report would certify that the JSIF is using its resources for the purposes for which they&#13;
were provided and that disbursements and procurement for all contacts are being carried&#13;
out in accordance with the agreed guidelines and Bank procurement regulations. Under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
the JSIF's Articles of Association, auditors would also be required to perforn an annual&#13;
management audit of the company. During appraisal, draft terms of reference for the&#13;
management audit was submitted is attached as Annex L.&#13;
6.17  External technical audits of an agreed upon percentage of subprojects would&#13;
also be carried out by local consultants to identify implementation constraints and assess&#13;
the technical quality of JSIF-financed subprojects. Information would be used by&#13;
management, in particular the Supervision Department, to remove obstacles and improve&#13;
the quality of work being performed. The technical audit would also provide information&#13;
on the coverage of operational and maintenance costs. The JSIF would adjust its&#13;
procedures and eligibility priorities based on the audit findings (para. 5.18).&#13;
7. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
7.1   The proposed project would finance more than 800 subprojects, expected to cost&#13;
an average of US$50,000 with none exceeding US$350,000, which would provide low-&#13;
income rural and urban communities with basic social and physical infrastructure, social&#13;
services and organizational strengthening. Based on the experience with social&#13;
investment funds in other countries, the project is expected to yield tangible, widespread&#13;
and sustainable benefits relatively quickly and transparently. Eligibility and appraisal&#13;
criteria for subprojects would ensure their efficiency within acceptable ranges of cost per&#13;
unit, cost per beneficiary and, where, applicable, economic rates of return.&#13;
7.2   Given the demand-driven nature of the investments, it is not possible to quantify&#13;
ex ante the exact numbers of subprojects in each category, the numbers of beneficiaries or&#13;
the actual benefits to be delivered. Based on a needs assessment exercise conducted&#13;
during preparation, the percentage of subprojects demanded by category, however, is&#13;
estimated to be: social infrastructure - 56 percent; economic infrastructure - 11 percent;&#13;
social services - 20 percent and organizational strengthening - 13 percent. Highest&#13;
priority would be given to the poorest geographic regions using a poverty map.&#13;
7.3   Expected subproject impacts include: (a) for education and training subprojects,&#13;
increased access to pre-primary and primary education, improved quality of the learning&#13;
environment; expended access to non-formal training and improved employability; (b) for&#13;
social development subprojects, improved quality of care facilities for children and the&#13;
elderly and increased access to community facilities; (c) for health and sanitation&#13;
subprojects, lower infant and maternal mortality and reduced incidence of disease; and (d)&#13;
for productive sector support subprojects, improved access to markets and increased&#13;
productivity and household income. The impact of subprojects would be monitored&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
against key performance indicators and through qualitative beneficiary assessments and&#13;
ex post evaluations.&#13;
7.4   The proposed project would also have important institutional effects in:&#13;
(a) expanding the capacity of NGOs/CBOs and communities to identify, prepare, manage&#13;
and sustain community-level investments, and thereby increasing stocks of social capital;&#13;
(b) demonstrating the relevance of beneficiary participation in reducing poverty; and&#13;
(c) providing an efficient and effective model of public sector implementation capacity.&#13;
B. Sustainability&#13;
7.5    During appraisal of the subproject, the JSIF would apply sustainability criteria.&#13;
All subprojects are required to have a high degree of participation by beneficiaries in&#13;
identification, preparation, management and maintenance, as evidenced by social analysis&#13;
and the level of community contribution. Sponsors of all subprojects would present a&#13;
specific plan for operations and maintenance. For subprojects generating recurrent costs,&#13;
coordinating agreements would require line ministries and local governments to&#13;
guarantee financing before the subproject is approved. For social services subprojects,&#13;
particular attention would be placed on the institutional analysis of the capacity of the&#13;
sponsor to sustain services beyond JSIF financing.&#13;
7.6    Given its temporary mandate, the sustainability of the JSIF as an institution is not&#13;
an issue. Based on experience, Government may wish to extend or transform the agency&#13;
as it approaches the closing date. The duration and scope of the JSIF after the end of the&#13;
proposed project would be evaluated with respect to its performance, the status of parallel&#13;
public sector reforms and Government's evolving poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
7.7   The proposed project faces several risks that are inherent in a new operation and&#13;
one in which resources are provided on a grant basis for numerous, widespread&#13;
investments which are not pre-identified. The principal risk relates to the leakage of&#13;
resources to non-target groups and/or areas because of political interference in the JSIF's&#13;
operations. The transparent and participatory nature of the project itself combined with&#13;
the visible benefits from subprojects, would create strong incentives for various&#13;
stakeholders - especially beneficiary communities, NGOs/CBOs, Parish Councils and&#13;
central government - not only to provide required counterpart resources, but to limit the&#13;
diversion of resources to non-target groups and/or areas. The risk of diversion of&#13;
resources is also mitigated by the establishment of the JSIF as an autonomous&#13;
government company with transparent and efficient operating procedures, clear targeting&#13;
criteria and adequate institutional checks and balances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
7.8   A second risk is that the decentralized nature of the operation could result in low&#13;
quality of subprojects because of non-compliance with established appraisal criteria or&#13;
insufficient supervision. To minimize this risk, the types of eligible subprojects and thus&#13;
the range of technical expertise the JSIF would need to maintain would be limited. For&#13;
eligible subprojects, quality control measures would include on-site supervision to be&#13;
contracted as part of subproject costs, independent technical reviews of subprojects,&#13;
impact evaluations with direct input from beneficiaries and intensive oversight by&#13;
external financing agencies.&#13;
7.9   A third risk is the lack of coherence and coordination with other sectoral activities&#13;
which could result in duplication of effort, inconsistency with established norms and&#13;
strategies, and a lack of absorption of recurrent costs after the project ends jeopardizing&#13;
the sustainability of benefits. To address this risk, the JSIF would incorporated sector&#13;
norms and technical specifications, where available, into its appraisal criteria. The JSIF&#13;
would also encourage the participation by key sector ministries and local governments in&#13;
the appraisal of subprojects and would enter into coordinating agreements specifying&#13;
approval and maintenance procedures and requirements.&#13;
7.10  In conclusion, based on strong Government ownership of the project, the&#13;
successful experiences with social investment funds in other countries and the safeguards&#13;
adopted to address specific risks, the overall risk that the project may not achieve its&#13;
development objectives is considered relatively low.&#13;

Eligibility Principles&#13;
I.  Subproject Menu: All projects must be on the menu of eligible subprojects.&#13;
2.  Poverty Targeting: Projects will benefit the poor. The types of eligible subprojects will help ensure high&#13;
coverage of poor people. Projects will also be targeted towards the poorest regions of the country based on a&#13;
poverty map.&#13;
3.  Beneficiary Participation: Projects must incorporate beneficiary participation at all stages of project&#13;
identification, design, implementation and operation.&#13;
4.  Beneficiary Cost-Sharing: The beneficiary group/project sponsor will be required to make a counterpart&#13;
contribution, either in cash or kind, towards financing of the project. The exact proportion of beneficiary&#13;
contribution will vary by type of project and resources of the beneficiary.&#13;
5.  Eligible Applicants: The JSIF will consider applications for project financing from project sponsors representing&#13;
community groups. Project sponsors may be central government ministries, local government authorities, non-&#13;
government and community-based organizations, community groups and private sector entities. An individual&#13;
may not sponsor a project. Subprojects for individual benefit will only be considered if requested by the&#13;
community.&#13;
6.  Project Sponsorship: The JSIF will not sponsor projects. It will respond to the demand for project proposed by&#13;
sponsors. The JSIF, government agencies and other groups will promote, encourage and orient the demand for&#13;
project financing.&#13;
7.  Project Implementation: The JSIF will not execute projects on its own, but will employ the services of local&#13;
contractors (civil works and goods projects) or consultants (service projects) to implement approved projects.&#13;
Contractors and consultants may be private sector companies, non-governmental and community-based&#13;
organizations or individuals which meet JSIF's requirements for implementation of small-scale community-based&#13;
projects. Except for certain types of projects (e.g., some social assistance projects), a sponsor may not serve as&#13;
contractor on the project.&#13;
8.  Recurrent Expenditures: The JSIF will not provide resources to supplement recurrent expenditures.&#13;
9.  Sustainability: The JSIF will not finance recurrent costs, including maintenance. Fund support will be&#13;
conditional upon confirmation that resources (private and public) will be made available to meet recurrent&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
10. Complementarity: The JSIF will collaborate with line ministries to ensure complementarity of objectives.&#13;
Infrastructure projects must, as far as possible, conform to the norms and standards of line ministries or relevant&#13;
authorities.&#13;
11. Project Size: The JSIF will finance small-scale community-based projects with a cost not exceeding&#13;
US$350,000.&#13;
12. Project Costs and Benefits: Projects will employ least-cost designs and deliver maximum benefits for a given&#13;
cost. Projects will be appraised according to standard methods of measuring costs and benefits.&#13;

SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
Objective&#13;
The technical assistance and training component is designed to strengthen the operational&#13;
capacity of the JSIF and improve the quality of its subprojects. Technical assistance and training&#13;
activities can be divided into two main categories: (i) institutional development and&#13;
management and (ii) subproject development and evaluation.&#13;
JSIF Institutional Development and Management&#13;
Computer Training: Local courses and expertise will be offered to train all JSIF technical and&#13;
support staff in the use of computers and the management information system used in the JSIF.&#13;
Management Information System: Local and international expertise will be hired as necessary&#13;
to refine the subproject cycle, unit cost and financial management components of the JSIF's&#13;
management information system.&#13;
Financial and Management Audits: The JSIF will hire independent, private auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank to produce the annual financial and management audits.&#13;
Study Tours: Once JSIF operations are underway, department and unit heads will travel to&#13;
other social investment funds to learn directly from their on-going experiences.&#13;
Subproject Development and Management&#13;
Promotions: To improve and increase the JSIF's outreach, local technical assistance will be&#13;
hired to design the promotional campaign, including producing informational materials and&#13;
organizing workshops.&#13;
Targeting: Technical assistance would be hired to review the poverty map and the JSIF's&#13;
demand management strategies to improve the targeting of JSIF-financed subprojects.&#13;
Participatory Needs Assessment/Project Identification: The JSIF will contract a long-tern&#13;
resident technical advisor to develop participatory techniques for community needs assessment&#13;
and project identification and disseminate these techniques to a range of organizations, including&#13;
Government's Social Development Commission, Parish Councils and NGOs/CBOs.&#13;
Social Analysis and Appraisal of Social Services Projects: The long-term resident technical&#13;
advisor will also refine the criteria that measure beneficiary participation and other social criteria&#13;
for JSIF's appraisal of subprojects; refine the criteria for appraising social services projects; and&#13;
train JSIF promotions and evaluation staff in techniques to evaluate social services projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Appraisal of Organizational Strengthening Projects: Local expertise will be hired to study&#13;
the organizational strengthening needs of subproject sponsors in identifying, preparing,&#13;
managing and supervising JSIF-financed subprojects and the resources available to these&#13;
organizations. The technical assistance would also develop criteria for appraising organizational&#13;
strengthening subprojects and train JSIF promotions and evaluation staff in applying these&#13;
criteria.&#13;
Gender: Local expertise will be hired to design criteria and strategies to ensure that the JSIF&#13;
reaches and positively impacts women.&#13;
Environmental Assessment Procedures: Local and/or international expertise would be hired&#13;
to develop environmental criteria for assessing JSIF-financed subprojects and develop mitigation&#13;
measures for subprojects with negative environmental impacts.&#13;
Unit Cost System: Local expertise will be hired to refine and update the unit cost system on a&#13;
regular basis.&#13;
Technical Audits: Local expertise will be hired to carry out annual technical audits of a sample&#13;
of subprojects to identify implementation constraints, assess the technical quality of JSIF-&#13;
financed subprojects, and provide information on the coverage of operational and maintenance&#13;
costs. The JSIF will adjust its procedures and eligibility priorities based on the audit findings.&#13;
New Subprojects: For each new type of subprojects to be added to the JSIF's Menu of Eligible&#13;
Subprojects, local or international expertise will be hired to provide assistance in the design of&#13;
eligibility and appraisal criteria and supervision procedures.&#13;
Beneficiary Assessments: The JSIF will contract local expertise to carry out beneficiary&#13;
assessments to receive direct, constructive and unbiased feedback on the impact of the&#13;
subprojects on the beneficiaries.&#13;
Impact Evaluations: The JSIF will hire local and/or international consultants to undertake&#13;
evaluations of the social and economic impact of specific subproject types.&#13;
&#13;

institution incorporated under the Companies Act designed to finance small-scale, community-based social&#13;
and economic infrastructure and social services projects in poor urban and rural areas. A detailed&#13;
Operational Manual governs the activities and procedures of the JSIF. The JSIF is financed by the&#13;
Government of Jamaica, loans provided by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank&#13;
and a grant from the Government of the Netherlands.&#13;
The JSIF is located in Kingston and is headed by a Managing Director who is in charge of day-to-&#13;
day activities and is accountable to a Board of Directors appointed by the Minister of Finance. The&#13;
Finance and Administration Department, headed by the Director of Finance and Administration, is&#13;
responsible for proper accounting of funds received by the JSIF.&#13;
Objective&#13;
The objective of the financial audit is to enable the auditor to express a professional opinion on&#13;
the financial position of the JSIF at the end of each fiscal year and of the funds received and expenditures&#13;
for the accounting period ending on that date, as presented by the financial statements of the project, and as&#13;
well as an opinion on the Special Accounts and the Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
The project accounts, which provide the basis for the preparation of financial statements, are those&#13;
established to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the project, as maintained by the JSIF. The&#13;
Special Accounts are special bank accounts set up by the JSIF to facilitate the speedy disbursement of the&#13;
World Bank's and other donors/lenders' portions of the project expenditures.&#13;
Scope&#13;
The audit will be carried out in accordance with the International Standards of Auditing and will&#13;
include such tests and controls as the auditor considers necessary. The auditor should indicate any material&#13;
differences from international accounting standards, where relevant, and their effect on the annual financial&#13;
statements. In conducting the audit, special attention should be paid to the following:&#13;
a) All external funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the relevant financing&#13;
agreements, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes for&#13;
which the financing was provided. Relevant financing agreements are [insert name of loan&#13;
agreements];&#13;
b) Counterpart funds have been provided and used in accordance with the relevant financing&#13;
agreements, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes for&#13;
which they were provided;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
c) Works, goods and services financed have been procured in accordance with the relevant&#13;
financing agreements;&#13;
d) All necessary supporting documents, records and accounts have been kept in respect of all&#13;
project expenditures, including expenditures reported via Special Accounts (SAs) or&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Clear linkages should exist between the books of account&#13;
and reports presented to the World Bank and other donors/lenders;&#13;
e) Special Account(s) have been maintained in accordance with the provisions of the relevant&#13;
financing agreements; and&#13;
f) Financial statements have been prepared in accordance with consistent applied International&#13;
Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the financial situation of the project at&#13;
mm/dd/yy and of resources and expenditures for the year ended on that date.&#13;
Project Financial Statements&#13;
The Project Financial Statements should include:&#13;
a) a Summary of Funds received, showing the World Bank, project funds from other&#13;
donors/lenders and counterpart funds separately;&#13;
b) a Summary of Expenditures shown under the main project headings and by main categories&#13;
of expenditures, both for the current fiscal year and accumulated to date; and&#13;
c) a Balance Sheet showing Accumulated Funds of the Project, bank balances, other assets of&#13;
the project and project liabilities, if any.&#13;
As an annex to the Project Financial Statements, the auditor should prepare a reconciliation&#13;
between the amounts shown as "received by the project from the World Bank" and that shown as being&#13;
disbursed by the World Bank. As part of that reconciliation, the auditor should indicate the mechanism for&#13;
the disbursement, i.e. Special Accounts, Statements of Expenditure or direct disbursement.&#13;
Statements of Expenditure&#13;
In addition to the audit of the Project Financial Statements, the auditor is required to audit all&#13;
SOEs used as the basis for the submission of withdrawal applications. The auditor should apply such tests&#13;
and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. These expenditures should be&#13;
carefully compared for project eligibility with the relevant financing agreement(s) and with reference to the&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report for guidance when considered necessary. Where ineligible expenditures are&#13;
identified as having been included in withdrawal applications and reimbursed against, these should be&#13;
noted separately by the auditor. Annexed to the Project Financial Statements should be a schedule listing&#13;
individual SOE withdrawal applications by special reference number and amount. The total withdrawals&#13;
under the SOE procedure should be part of the overall reconciliation of World Bank disbursements&#13;
described above.&#13;
Special Accounts&#13;
In conjunction with the audit of the Project Financial Statements, the auditor is also required to&#13;
audit the activities of the Special Account(s) associated with the Project. Special Accounts usually&#13;
comprise:&#13;
* deposits and replenishments received from the World Bank;&#13;
* payments substantiated by withdrawal applications;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
* interest that my be earned from the balances and which belong to the borrower; and&#13;
*  the remaining balances at the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
The auditor must form an opinion as to the degree of compliance with the World Bank's&#13;
procedures and the balance of the Special Account as year-end. The audit should examine the eligibility&#13;
and correctness of the financial transactions during the period under review and fund balances at the end of&#13;
such a period, the operation and use of the SA in accordance with the financing agreement, and the&#13;
adequacy of internal controls for this type of disbursement mechanism. The Special Account(s) are&#13;
referred to in [cite Schedule] of the relevant financing agreements.&#13;
Audit Opinion&#13;
Besides a primary opinion of the Project Financial Statements, the annual audit report of the&#13;
Project Accounts should include a separate paragraph commenting on the accuracy and propriety of&#13;
expenditures withdrawn under SOE procedures and the extent to which the Bank can rely on SOEs as a&#13;
basis for loan disbursement. The financial statements, including the audit report, should be received by the&#13;
World Bank no later than four months after the end of the auditing period to which the audit refers. The&#13;
auditor should submit the report to the borrower's designated agent rather than to any staff member of the&#13;
project entity. The agent should then promptly forward two copies of the audited accounts and report to&#13;
the World Bank.&#13;
Management Letter&#13;
In addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter", in which the&#13;
auditor will:&#13;
a) comment on the accounting records, systems and controls that were examined during the&#13;
course of the audit;&#13;
b) identify specific deficiencies and areas of weakness in systems and controls and make&#13;
recommendation for their improvement;&#13;
c) report on the degree of compliance of each of the financial covenants on the financing&#13;
agreement and give comments, if any, on intern and external matters affecting such&#13;
compliance;&#13;
d) communicate matters that have come to attention during the audit which might have a&#13;
significant impact on the implementation of the project; and&#13;
e) bring to the borrower's attention any other matters that the auditors consider pertinent.&#13;
General&#13;
The auditor should be given access to all legal documents, correspondence and any other&#13;
information associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor. Confirmation should also be&#13;
obtained of amounts disbursed and outstanding at the World Bank and of amounts disbursed under (special&#13;
other donor, loan or grant). The World Bank Task Manager can assist in obtaining these confirmations.&#13;
It is highly desirable that the auditor become familiar wit the Bank's Guidelines on Financial&#13;
Reporting andAuditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank, which summarizes the Bank's financial&#13;
reporting and auditing requirements. The auditor should also be familiar with the Bank's Disbursement&#13;
Handbool Both documents will be provided by the World Bank Task Manager.&#13;

Terms of Reference - External Management Audit&#13;
Background&#13;
The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is a temporary, autonomous Government-sponsored&#13;
institution incorporated under the Companies Act designed to finance small-scale, community&#13;
based social and economic infrastructure and social services projects in poor urban and rural&#13;
areas. A detailed Operational Manual governs the activities and procedures of the JSIF. The&#13;
JSIF is financed by the Government of Jamaica, loans provided by the World Bank and the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank and a grant from the Government of the Netherlands.&#13;
Objective&#13;
A management audit is a systematic procedure for analyzing and appraising the overall&#13;
performance of the management of a business or organization. It involves a critical appraisal of&#13;
all managerial operations, policies, procedures, and the quality of management. Its objective is&#13;
to ascertain whether the resources of an organization are used by its management in the most&#13;
economic way to produce the maximum possible result in the shortest possible time in&#13;
accordance with its goals.&#13;
The Management Audit is a helpful extension to the financial audit, and deals with the&#13;
following:&#13;
* efficiency and effectiveness of management in achievement of company objectives;&#13;
* budgetary control systems;&#13;
* performance of the management of the finance, accounting, marketing, and production&#13;
functions.&#13;
The management audit must determine if the project is being executed in accordance with the&#13;
"three Es" - economy (doing things cheap), efficiency (doing things right), and effectiveness&#13;
(doing the right things).&#13;
Scope&#13;
The management audit will examine the internal control system. Internal control may be defined&#13;
as the whole system of controls, financial and otherwise, established by the management in order&#13;
to carry on the business of the company in an orderly manner, safeguard its assets and secure, as&#13;
far as possible, the accuracy and reliability of its records. It will be observed that the concept of&#13;
internal control goes beyond financial and accounting matters and the custody of company assets&#13;
to include controls designed to improve operational efficiency and adherence to company&#13;
policies.&#13;
The management audit will focus on the operational controls versus the internal accounting&#13;
controls (i.e. those that are relevant to the expression of an audit opinion on the financial&#13;
accounts). In conducting the management audit, special attention should be paid to the following:&#13;
Organization and Human Resources&#13;
Organization - The overall management and departmental structure should be clearly defined,&#13;
preferably by organizational charts and written job descriptions, showing authorities, duties, and&#13;
lines of responsibility. Care should be taken to ensure that the analysis articulates what actually&#13;
exists, and what is actually being achieved. The aim of this aspect of the examination is to form&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
an opinion of the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of the structure, functions, span of&#13;
control and responsibilities as a means of achieving the company's objectives.&#13;
Authority levels - Adequate authority levels should be established and set out for the initiation or&#13;
approval of transactions. Watch for the danger of breakdown in acceptance of authority at any&#13;
level.&#13;
Competence of staff - Personal appraisals of the staff should be made with a view to forming an&#13;
opinion of aptitude, ability, industry and integrity. Do staff understand, and are they competent&#13;
to carry out the work entrusted to them. The extent of co-ordination of executives and the degree&#13;
of harmony among them as a team is also to be considered. The quality of each director must be&#13;
assessed and the value of his contribution to the board be evaluated, bearing in mind the needs of&#13;
the company within specified areas. Also, the effectiveness of the directors working together as&#13;
a team should be considered.&#13;
Financial accounting and reporting&#13;
To have assurance that accounting records properly reflect what they are designed to record, the&#13;
management audit needs to assess the adequacy of the systems of internal control goveming the&#13;
financial management system, with particular reference to the structure of the financial&#13;
accounting and reporting system.&#13;
The audit shall also assess if the objectives of internal controls are being met, that is that the&#13;
system not only maintains an adequate method of processing accounting data, but also&#13;
safeguards the JSIF against possible financial loss due to fraud or error. The audit should form&#13;
an opinion on whether:&#13;
* the JSIF receives and enters in its accounting records, all the income or revenue to which it is&#13;
entitled;&#13;
- all expenditure is properly authorized;&#13;
* all assets are properly recorded and safeguarded;&#13;
* all liabilities are properly recorded and provision is made for known or expected losses;&#13;
* the accounting records provide a reliable basis for the preparation of accounts.&#13;
Operations Management Practices&#13;
As a follow up to the financial accounting and reporting system, the management audit should&#13;
also give an opinion on whether the principles of internal accounting controls are in place -&#13;
specifically (a) basic controls and (b) the disciplines over basic controls.&#13;
(a)    Basic Controls - should be designed to ensure that the JSIF's transactions are valid (i.e.&#13;
proper, bona fide and authorized) and that they are recorded completely and accurately in the&#13;
books.&#13;
(b)    Disciplines over Basic Controls - the management audit should examine:&#13;
(i)    Supervisory controls;&#13;
(ii)    Separation of duties; and&#13;
(iii)   Custodial controls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
(I)    Supervisory Controls&#13;
The auditor will provide an opinion on the following:&#13;
(a)    Final approval of documents after they have been subjected to the relevant basic controls&#13;
but before further processing takes place (e.g. final approval of payroll before the amounts are&#13;
distributed).&#13;
(b)    Review by a responsible official of the operation of basic control techniques (e.g. the&#13;
inspection of reconciliations etc.)&#13;
Supervisory controls should only be regarded by the auditor as effective where the signature of&#13;
the supervising official exists to evidence the control function.&#13;
(II)    Separation of Duties&#13;
The auditor should ensure that:&#13;
(a)    there is a well defined division of responsibilities between departments, sections and&#13;
individuals, so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end. In particular,&#13;
there should be a division of responsibilities in respect of each transaction for::&#13;
(i)    authorizing or initiating the transaction;&#13;
(ii)   the physical custody and control of assets related to the transactions;&#13;
(iii)   recording the transaction in the accounting records.&#13;
The duties of the individuals exercising these different functions should be clearly defined and&#13;
where practicable, set out in writing, together with the extent of there respect of their respective&#13;
authorities.&#13;
(b)    Rotation of duties - where practical, arrangements should be made for the duties of staff&#13;
to be rotated so that no one person deals with one aspect of the company's accounting procedures&#13;
on a continuous basis.&#13;
(III) Custodial Controls&#13;
The auditor should give an opinion regarding the controls designed to ensure that assets&#13;
(including significant documents such as contracts and cheques) are maintained securely. These&#13;
controls include physical arrangements such as the use of safes, use of locked fencing for&#13;
valuable items of stock and safe custody procedures for title deeds and investment.&#13;
General&#13;
The objective of the management audit is to enable the auditor to express a professional opinion&#13;
on the financial viability, financial condition, stewardship and accountability, expenditure&#13;
allocations, balancing of inflows and outflows and financial compliance with budgets of the&#13;
JSIF. The auditor should be given access to all legal documents, correspondence and any other&#13;
information associated with the project deemed necessary by the auditor.&#13;

            Jamaica - Social Investment Fund Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Social
            Investment Fund Project for Jamaica is to contribute to the
            reduction of poverty and help create an environment for
            sustainable national development. More specifically, the
            Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is designed to assist
            the government in responding to the needs of the most
            vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing programs
            and institutional mechanisms by: (a) establishing an
            efficient, demand-driven and complementary mechanism to
            deliver basic services and infrastructure to the poor; (b)
            mobilizing and channeling additional resources to the areas
            of basic social and economic infrastructure and social
            services; and (c) increasing national institutional capacity
            to identify, design, implement, manage and sustain
            small-scale community-based projects. The project consists
            of two components. The first will finance subprojects
            approved by the JSIF in the areas of social infrastructure,
            economic infrastructure, social services, and organizational
            strengthening. The second component will fund institutional
            support for the JSIF's establishment and operations,
            including (i) salaries, vehicles, equipment and operating
            expenses; and (ii) technical assistance and training to
            improve the JSIF's operational capacity and procedures.
