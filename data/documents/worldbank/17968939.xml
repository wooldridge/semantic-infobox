                            Broches, Aron&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Professor Robert W. Oliver, California&#13;
Institute of Technology, on 1985-11-07&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches talks about one of the first things George Woods did as&#13;
President, considered to be an accomplishment, and that was opening&#13;
the way to more cordial relations with the U.N. Another, in 1964 when&#13;
he was instrumental in obtaining authority for Bank transfers to IDA&#13;
eventually authorized in '64 at the Tokyo Annual Meeting. Woods very&#13;
active in emphasizing education and agriculture lending, Woods'&#13;
favorite country India, and the first President of the World Bank who&#13;
knew something in advance about it as he had been head of one of the&#13;
Bank's principal underwriters, First Boston. He had been on one or two&#13;
missions to India and considered himself an expert. Broches mentions&#13;
Woods' efforts, around '65 or'66, in offering to reschedule the Bank&#13;
loans to India, the ensuing unpleasantness at the Board, and his own&#13;
(Broches') legal opinion on the matter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches talks about his work in establishing the International&#13;
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in '62, and&#13;
Woods' help in bringing the Centre about; considered to be one of his&#13;
achievements. The importance of the IDA transfer to Woods and the&#13;
difficulties encountered in the Second IDA Replenishment. Broches&#13;
elaborates on the legal set up of ICSID as an institution with its own&#13;
international status, the first dispute submitted when McNamara was&#13;
president, the ICSID Convention and his election as its Secretary-&#13;
General.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches mentions the amendment to an American foreign aid bill&#13;
which went before Congress around '66-'67 known as the Hickenlooper&#13;
&amp;#12;Amendment, its aim to prevent foreign aid to governments who had not&#13;
settled with foreign bond holders, and its effect on Bank business. He&#13;
also talks about Woods being tough on defaulting debtors, and his&#13;
involvement with the Council of Foreign Bondholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches elaborates on the U.N. General Assembly resolutions&#13;
calling on the Fund and the Bank not to deal with South Africa and&#13;
Portugal, and the complications arising from that compelling Woods to&#13;
send Broches to offer an explanation before the U.N. Trusteeship&#13;
Council. In that context, he talks about the provisions of the Bank's&#13;
relationship agreement with the U.N., and the terms of the Bank's&#13;
Articles of Agreement in conducting its business with its member&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches talks about when in 1947 Poland was believed to come into&#13;
the Marshall Plan and the Bank negotiating a loan for the reactivation&#13;
of its coal mines. The Bank's refusal in 1948 to proceed with the loan&#13;
because Poland decided not to join the Marshall Plan, and the ensuing&#13;
complications arising from that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches mentions the relationship agreement signed with the U.N.&#13;
in 1947 making the Bank a specialized agency under Article 57 of the&#13;
U.N. Charter later extended to cover IDA and IFC. The closer alliance&#13;
in the early Woods years with various U.N. agencies. The Bank's&#13;
cooperation with FAO and UNESCO then later with the WHO and the ILO,&#13;
the informal consultation with the UNDP on IDA policies, then&#13;
cooperation as UNDP's executing agent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     According to Broches, Woods established the President's Council&#13;
in late '64 comprising five people: Burke Knapp, lending; Siem&#13;
Aldewereld, projects; Dick Demuth and Broches, Legal; and Geoffrey&#13;
Wilson, Finance and Administration, and later Irving Friedman as&#13;
Economic Adviser. He talks of the verbatim transcripts of the minutes&#13;
of the Executive Directors meeting, and the related access policy.&#13;
Broches concludes with Woods' difficult relations with the staff, the&#13;
&amp;#12;Board, Henry Fowler [Secretary of the Treasury] and, how under&#13;
McNamara these were much improved.&#13;

            In November 1985, Aron Broches was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1946 to 1980, Mr. Broches worked in the
            following areas: in the legal department as an attorney
            (1946-1951); as assistant general counsel (1951-1956), as
            associate general counsel (1956-1959), and as general
            counsel (1959-1971) of the World Bank and the International
            Finance Corporation (IFC); as vice president (1972-1979);
            and in the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
            Dispute (ICSID) as secretary general (1967-1980). His
            association with the World Bank dates back to the Bretton
            Woods conference in the summer of 1944. His transcript
            concerns the following: George Woods as president of the
            World Bank; rescheduling the World Bank loans to India and
            the ensuing unpleasantness at the Board; an American foreign
            aid bill known as the Hickenlooper amendment; and his
            involvement with the council of foreign bondholders. Mr.
            Broches also discusses the United Nations (UN) in 1947
            making the World Bank a specialized agency under article 57
            of the UN charter later extended to cover International
            Development Association (IDA) and International Finance
            Corporation (IFC).
