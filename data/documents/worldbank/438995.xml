        <abstracts>
            This paper examines the increasing
            participation of the private sector in the transmission and
            distribution of natural gas in developing countries during
            the 1990s, resulting mainly from the growing demand for new
            gas transport facilities coinciding with a growing consensus
            in favor of private participation in infrastructure. This
            note, drawing on the bank's PPI (Private Participation
            in Infrastructure) Project database, provides an overview of
            the patterns and trends in the projects in the twenty six
            developing countries which introduced private participation
            in natural gas between 1990 and 1997. It concludes with the
            thought that growth in privately funded and operated export
            projects promise s to bring the economic and environmental
            benefits of natural gas to a larger number of countries.
