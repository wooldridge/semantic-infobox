a. Contributions of members with annual rates of inflation greater than 15 percent during the 1989-91 period are denominated&#13;
in SDRs.&#13;
b. On January I. 1993. the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic was succeeded by the Czech Republic and the Slovak&#13;
Republic.&#13;
c. The basic national currency contribution of France is equivalent to a 7.3 percent share of SDR 13 billion using&#13;
May-October exchange rates.&#13;
d. This amount is the SDR equivalent of Lit. 1,169,390.71 million. that is, an IDA- 10 contribution of Lit. 1.124,000 million and&#13;
Lit. 45,390.71 million resulting from encashing the IDA- I0 contribution on an eight-year schedule rather than a ten-year period.&#13;
e. The government of New Zealand notified the association that it is increasing its contribution from NZ$38.09 (SDR 14.94&#13;
million) shown in the IDA-10 resolution to NZ$39.58 million (SDR 15.52 million).&#13;
f. These countries are not yet in a position to commit to a final contribution to IDA-10. The levels shown are indicative.&#13;
g. Reflects additional resources available to IDA as a result of encashing contributions on an eight-year schedule rather than&#13;
a ten-year period. Contributions of Australia and the United Kingdom will be encashed over a ten-year period. The&#13;
participation of Italy and Canada is shown as part of their basic contribution.&#13;
h. The change in encashment schedule will enable IDA to lower its liquidity requirements by SDR 200 million, which will be&#13;

NOTE: The number of operations shown under different sources add up to a figure exceeding the total number of cofinanced&#13;
projects because a number of projects were cofinanced from more than one source. Details may not add to totals because&#13;
of rounding.&#13;
a. These statistics are compiled from the financing plans presented at the time of approval of the W'orld Bank loans and&#13;
credits by its board of executive directors. The amounts of official cofinancing are, in most cases, firm commitments by that&#13;
stage; export credits and private cofinancing amounts, however, are generally only estimates since such cofinancing is&#13;
actually arranged as required for project implementation and gets firmed up a year or two after board approval. The statistics&#13;
of private cofinancing in these tables for any fiscal year do not necessarily reflect market placements in that year.&#13;

            activities during this period; provides a global perspective
            of the world economy; and discusses Bank activities and
            finances. In addition, the report summarizes projects
            approved for assistance in fiscal 1993 and provides a
