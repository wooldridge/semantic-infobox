                   De s pi t e r a pi d e c on om ic gr ow t h , i n e qua l i t y&#13;
                   i s i nc r e a s i ng i n I n d on e s i a . After recovering&#13;
                   from the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                   real GDP per capita grew at an annual average of 5.4&#13;
                   percent between 2000 and 2014. This robust rate of&#13;
                   growth helped to halve the poverty rate from 23.4 percent&#13;
                   during the crisis down to 11.2 percent by 2015. However,&#13;
                   between 2003 and 2010, consumption per person for the&#13;
                   richest 10 percent of Indonesians grew at over 6 percent&#13;
                   per year after adjusting for inflation, while for the poorest&#13;
                   40 percent it grew by less than 2 percent per year. This&#13;
                   disparity in consumption between different income levels&#13;
                   has, in turn, given rise to a sharp increase in the Gini&#13;
                   coefficient over the past 15 years, increasing from 30 in&#13;
                   2000 to 41 in 2013.&#13;

                   Inequality of opportunity, when not everyone has access&#13;
                   to the same opportunities in life, accounts for one-third of&#13;
                   all consumption inequality. Access to opportunitiesâ&#128;&#148;such&#13;
                   as adequate health facilities and good quality schoolsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                   impact whether children are able to cognitively and&#13;
                   physically develop, which in turn affects whether they can&#13;
                   acquire the skills needed to find well-paying jobs. Thus,&#13;
                   inequality experienced at birth perpetuates inequality in&#13;
                   later life.&#13;

       Papua are further away from homes, less likely to have               hous e hol d h e a d d oe s n o t. As parents become&#13;
&#13;
       access to electricity or proper sanitation facilities, and           richer and better educated, their children are more likely&#13;
       less likely to have high quality teachers. Papua is the only         to have access to higher quality health and education&#13;
       region without universal access to primary school (SD),              services. There are also improvements in intermediary&#13;
                                                                            outcomes such as stunting and educational test scores.&#13;

       to the nearest village with a primary school. Thus, children&#13;

       1. THE HUMAN OPPORTUNITY INDEX HOI                               opportunities among children for three main reasons.&#13;
       The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) was ï¬&#129;rst developed             First, from an empirical standpoint, using children as&#13;
       based on the social welfare function proposed by Sen,            a unit of analysis makes it possible to analyze how the&#13;
       which allows di erence weights to be placed on the               di erent circumstances they are born in to a ect their&#13;
       outcomes of di erent individuals (Sen 1976). Barros et           later achievements, as children (unlike adults) cannot&#13;
       al. (2009) then applied Senâ&#128;&#153;s framework and proposed a           be expected to make the e orts needed to access&#13;
       Human Opportunity Index which provided estimations for           these basic goods by themselves. Second, from a&#13;
       Latin America. Their HOI aims to measure the absolute            policy standpoint, evidence indicates that interventions&#13;
       level of basic opportunities in a society and how equitably      to equalize opportunities early in the lifecycle of an&#13;
       those opportunities are distributed within society. The          individual are signiï¬&#129;cantly more cost e ective and&#13;
       index essentially incorporates these measures into one           successful than interventions later in life. Third, focusing&#13;
       single composite indicator.                                      on children helps to put inequality of opportunity at the&#13;

       The HOI summarizes in a single composite indicator:              birth, children cannot be held responsible for their family&#13;
       (i) how many opportunities are available, that is, the           circumstances (Barros et al. 2009).&#13;
       coverage rate of a basic service; and (ii) how equitably&#13;
       those opportunities are distributed, that is, whether the        The HOI aims to provide an ex ante evaluation of how&#13;
       distribution of that coverage is related to exogenous            likely it is that children will do well. The HOI can be&#13;

       average coverage rate for a given basic opportunityâ&#128;&#148;             providing all children with equal access to these basic&#13;
       can be readily determined using household survey                 opportunities, simultaneously tracking both the overall&#13;
       data. The second componentâ&#128;&#148;the equity of opportunity             coverage and the equity of their distribution. The HOI&#13;
       distributionâ&#128;&#148;requires a more involved calculation.               can therefore serve as a tool to help guide public policies&#13;
       Progress in the HOI can occur by: (i) increases in               aimed at equalizing opportunity.&#13;

        2. THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX MPI                             The key criticism of multidimensional poverty indices&#13;
       The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was                           arises from the fact that the weights used to aggregate&#13;
       published for the ï¬&#129;rst time in the United Nations Human                across dimensions lack the intrinsic meaning associated&#13;
       Development 2010 Report. The MPI complements                           with prices, which are used to add the components of&#13;
       monetary measures of poverty by considering overlapping                consumption expenditure (or, implicitly, its dual, the&#13;
       deprivations su ered by people at the same time. The                   incomes used to ï¬&#129;nance consumption). Under the law&#13;
       index identiï¬&#129;es deprivations across the same three                     of one price, and given relatively weak assumptions on&#13;
       dimensions as the HDI and shows the number of people                   preferences, relative prices are equal to the rate at which&#13;
       who are multidimensionally poor (su ering deprivations                 consumers themselvesâ&#128;&#148;regardless of their income levels&#13;

       Survey (Susenas) data from Indonesia to explore whether                alternatives to the false dichotomy between scalar&#13;
       these multidimensionally deprived households are                       indices of multidimensional poverty on the one hand,&#13;
       necessarily income poor or not. Sumarto and De Silva                   and a â&#128;&#156;dashboardâ&#128;&#157; approach that looks only at marginal&#13;
       (2014) conclude that the overlap between consumption                   distributions on the other. They argue that such a&#13;
       poverty and multidimensional poverty is extremely weak.                dichotomous view misses the point and suggest that&#13;
       Consequently, their ï¬&#129;ndings broaden the targeting space                the analysis should examine the interdependence&#13;
       for poverty reduction, suggesting that poverty reduction               between dimensions. These alternatives include simple&#13;
       programs should provide di erent kinds of assistance to                Venn diagrams of the overlap of deprivations across&#13;
       the poor in di erent dimensions of poverty.                            dimensions; this can be termed the â&#128;&#156;associativeâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
                                                                              approach. The second alternative is the use of&#13;
       Alkire and Foster (2011) and Maasoumi and Lugo (2008)                  multivariate stochastic dominance analysis, which&#13;
       have proposed scalar indices that seek to combine,                     permits partial orderings across joint distributions that&#13;
       in a single number, information from those various                     are robust not only to poverty lines and welfare weights&#13;
       dimensions. One advantage of using a single number is                  (as in the unidimensional case) but also to dimension&#13;
       that it makes comparison across countries, regions or                  weights. The third alternative is the analysis of copula&#13;
       individuals, more feasible. However, one key limitation                functions to capture the extent of interdependency&#13;
       in the use of multidimensional indices is that it requires             across dimensions. Ferreira and Lugo (2012) highlight&#13;
       the use of relative weights for each dimension, which are              the importance of examining the joint distribution&#13;
       chosen arbitrarily.                                                    between di erent achievements (or deprivations) so&#13;

        On average, more than 10 percent of schools in Indonesia&#13;
        do not have access to electricity and most are located&#13;
        in Papua. In fact, more than one in three schools in Papua&#13;
        does not have electricity. The lack of electricity in a school&#13;
        poses major problems, resulting in a lack of good lighting&#13;
        and the inability to use multimedia equipment such as&#13;
        the use of overhead projectors and computers. This&#13;
        means that lessons are delivered less e ectively than&#13;
        in schools that are able to use technology and various&#13;
        multimedia equipment.&#13;

           ACCESS TO WATER IN SCHOOL BATHROOMS IS STILL A CHALLENGE IN INDONESIA WITH THE RESULT THAT&#13;
          STUDENTS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE. On average, 18 percent of schools in Indonesia do not have running&#13;
          water in their bathrooms. Some regions, such as Maluku and Papua, have double the level of schools without water&#13;
          in their bathrooms compared with Java and Bali. UNICEF (2005) contends that the lack of clean water and sanitation&#13;
          in schools jeopardizes the quality education, as clean water and sanitation are both essential to protect childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          health and their ability to learn at school. In this sense, they are as vital as textbooks to a childâ&#128;&#153;s education. No water in&#13;
          bathrooms means that students do not wash their hands after they have been to the toilet, or wash their hands before&#13;
          they eat. This is highly unsanitary and increases the potential for the spread of diseases such as diarrhea and typhoid.&#13;

          is important in ensuring that students are not only learning theories, but also exposed to practical work. On average,&#13;
          70 percent of junior secondary schools in Indonesia do not have access to a laboratory. Urban and rural di erences&#13;
          and di erences across a region are only 10 percent at most. This is worrying as it means that most Indonesian students&#13;
          do not have the facilities to enable them to do well in science. In fact, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s OECD Pisa 2012 and 2015 results&#13;
          reveal that 15-year-old students in Indonesia (or those who are expected to be in the last grade of junior secondary&#13;
          school) score badly in science compared with other countries in the region.&#13;

          of children fail to enroll in primary school (Figure 9b and Figure 14a). Therefore, the challenges in enrollment may go&#13;
          beyond supply constraints. Furthermore, household per capita consumption also reveals that children from households&#13;
          with higher per capita consumption are more likely to be enrolled than those who come from households with lower&#13;
          per capita consumption. This further points toward demand-based constraints.&#13;

       the examination scores of students aged 10-15 years of age, it is evident that students whose parents have lower levels&#13;
       of education have lower test scores than those who have parents with higher levels of education. Similarly, students&#13;
       who come from poorer households have lower test scores than those who come from households with higher levels&#13;
       of consumption. All this means that some children cannot gain the same advantages from schooling, even if they have&#13;
       access to schools.&#13;

         G A P S S T I L L E X I S T. People living in eastern Indonesia, especially those living in Papua, are more likely to experience&#13;
         di culties in accessing primary health care. More than 25 percent of Papuans still face challenges in reaching primary&#13;
         health care services such as polyclinics, Puskesmas, Puskesmas Pembantu, or a physicianâ&#128;&#153;s practice. As expected, the&#13;
         poorest deciles are more likely to have di culties in accessing primary health care than richer deciles, possibly due to&#13;
         the fact that rural areas mostly consist of poorer households.&#13;

 as running water and electricity. More than one in four Puskesmas in Maluku and one in 10 in Papua do not have a doctor,&#13;
 compared with the national average of one in three. One in 25 Puskesmas in Indonesia does not have access to running&#13;
 water. This means that water is either obtained from a well, or even possibly from an unprotected source. Meanwhile, on&#13;
 average in Indonesia, one in 50 Puskesmas does not have electricity, and Papua has the worst access with more than one&#13;
 in four Puskesmas having no access to electricity.&#13;

        WHILE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES ARE IMPROVING, THERE ARE OBVIOUS REGIONAL DISPARITIES WITHIN&#13;
        INDONESIA AND IN COMPARING INDONESIA WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. On average, 4 percent&#13;
        of children in Indonesia have never been immunized, and the numbers are especially high for Papua with almost&#13;
        18 percent of children never having been immunized. Lack of access to health care may also explain the high level&#13;
        of maternal mortality. In 2013, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s maternal mortality ratio was almost four times of that of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s, a country&#13;
        with a lower GDP per capita than Indonesia. In Indonesia, 190 out of 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, compared with&#13;
        49 in Vietnam (World Development Indicators).&#13;
&#13;
        WHILE CHILDREN FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH A HIGHER PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION ARE LESS LIKELY NOT TO&#13;
        BE IMMUNIZED, THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AS SOME CHILDREN EVEN IN THE RICHEST DECILE&#13;
        HAVE NEVER BEEN IMMUNIZED. Almost 8 percent of children from the poorest decile compared with 1 percent of&#13;
        children from the richest decile have never received any form of immunization. Immunization plays a signiï¬&#129;cant role&#13;
        in ensuring that children are protected from highly preventable diseases such as polio.&#13;

        of children have poor education, and health access and poor transportation. By contrast, only 1 percent of children in&#13;
        urban areas have all three negative indicators. Therefore, the solution in rural areas may not necessarily lie in creating&#13;
        new schools or health care facilities, but rather in improving the transportation infrastructure so that people are able&#13;
        to get to these facilities more easily. Meanwhile, interventions for urban areas that focus on improving transportation&#13;
        services will be less e ective in improving access to health and education, as only 5 percent of urban children who&#13;
        lack access to health and education also lack access to transportation.&#13;

       is less than 1 percent in Java/Bali. Lack of good roads means that it takes longer for goods to be delivered, and makes&#13;
       the delivery of perishable goods more challenging. Moreover, lack of good roads means that travel will also take longer,&#13;
       whether this is to schools or to health care centers. Therefore, good road infrastructure plays a crucial role&#13;
       in development as it better connects people with services, food, and markets.&#13;

         the percentage of households without access to regular transport to their local district government o ce. On average,&#13;
         27 percent of households in Indonesia have no access to regular public transport to their local district o ce. As&#13;
         previously, eastern Indonesia has the worst access to a public transportation system, with 55 percent of households in&#13;
         Papua and 49 percent of households in Kalimantan without regular transport to the district o ce. What is interesting is&#13;
         that, looking at the per capita consumption decile, there are no signiï¬&#129;cant di erences across deciles.&#13;

       Annex: Data And Methodology&#13;
&#13;
       This paper examines inequality in Indonesia, more speciï¬&#129;cally inequality of opportunity. It utilizes three di erent&#13;
       analytical tools to examine inequality through di erent dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
       1. INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY DECOMPOSITION&#13;
       One way to analyze inequality of opportunity is to use decomposition analysis. Decomposition analysis essentially&#13;
       looks at how an individualâ&#128;&#153;s current per capita consumption is a ected by various factors. The sample consists of&#13;
       households in which the head of the household was born after 1948. This personâ&#128;&#153;s household per capita consumption&#13;
       is used to predict their welfare. Then a range of their circumstances at birth are examined to see which aspects have&#13;
       led them to have the per capita consumption expenditure that they have today.&#13;
&#13;
       2. DASHBOARD APPROACH&#13;
       The second analysis is done through a dashboard approach, which essentially provides di erent indices for each&#13;
       dimension. The dashboard approach allows for comparison of achievements (or deprivations) across di erent groups.&#13;
       For instance, it analyzes whether there are any signiï¬&#129;cant di erences between: access to schools for those living in&#13;
       urban/rural areas, di erences between those who have male/female headed households, di erences based on the&#13;
       education attainment of the parents, di erences across di erent parts of Indonesia, and whether there are di erences&#13;
       by decile measured based on consumption expenditure. The dashboard approach therefore considers the marginal&#13;
       distribution between achievements (or deprivations) across di erent groups.&#13;
&#13;
       3. ASSOCIATIONS VENN&#13;
       Following Ferreira and Lugo (2012), this paper also examines the correlation between achievements (or deprivations)&#13;
       graphically through the use of Venn diagrams. It essentially aims to answer whether individuals who score negatively&#13;
       in one dimension also score negatively in other dimensions. For example, the associations between physical access to&#13;
       education, health, and transportation services, or education, the presence of a midwife, and unskilled delivery. These&#13;
       correlation/associations have important implications for program design and targeting.&#13;
&#13;
       This paper utilizes data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), which provides reliable information on relevant&#13;
       dimensions such as health status, anthropometrics, education and consumption. IFLS is a panel survey so it allows for&#13;
       the examination of individuals over time, which in turn allows for the analysis of individualsâ&#128;&#153; consumption expenditure&#13;
       or education outcome in relation their circumstances at birth. The National Socioeconomic Survey (Survei Sosial&#13;
       Ekonomi Nasional, or Susenas) and the village potential data (Potensi Desa, or Podes) are also used to examine the&#13;
       existence of public infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools.&#13;

            An unfair start : how unequal opportunities

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Despite rapid economic growth,
            inequality is increasing in Indonesia. After recovering from
            the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98, Indonesia's real
            GDP per capita grew at an annual average of 5.4 percent
            between 2000 and 2014. This robust rate of growth helped to
            halve the poverty rate from 23.4 percent during the crisis
            down to 11.2 percent by 2015. However, between 2003 and
            2010, consumption per person for the richest 10 percent of
            Indonesians grew at over 6 percent per year after adjusting
            for inflation, while for the poorest 40 percent it grew by
            less than 2 percent per year. This disparity in consumption
            between different income levels has, in turn, given rise to
            a sharp increase in the Gini coefficient over the past 15
            years, increasing from 30 in 2000 to 41 in 2013.
