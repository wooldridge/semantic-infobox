ABSTRACT&#13;
Is private access to land the main insurance against rural poverty?&#13;
Alternative forms of insurance-customary, cooperative, collective, or&#13;
common-property terms; off-farm income; access to "free" spare land-appear&#13;
to be dwindling, either in availability or in insurance value. In&#13;
developing Asia and Africa private land forms an increasingly dominant&#13;
share of rural productive assets. Yet, in unirrigated and unreliably&#13;
rainfed places, there is no association between land owned or operated&#13;
(between zero and five to ten acres) and poverty risk. Even tiny amounts&#13;
of reliably watered land reduce that risk however. These facts appear to&#13;
be due to interactive relations between groups of producers, rather than to&#13;
statistical relations between farm size and income per person.&#13;
The tenancy relationship, however, does not uniformly increase or&#13;
reduce poverty. Therefore (and even allowing for evasion), land reform,&#13;
especially in well-watered areas, has been much more significant in&#13;
reducing poverty--and tenure reform, much less so--than is often claimed.&#13;
Both reforms'must increasingly be judged by their effects on the&#13;
landless and near-landless poor, but the numbers and growth of this group&#13;
are often overstated. In India perhaps 15-20 percent of people (not'all&#13;
poor) both depend mainly on agriculture for income and have no or minimal&#13;
access to farmland. In Africa, although land scarcity and inequality are&#13;
more serious than is often claimed, there is only a very weak link between&#13;
farmland per household and income per person. As with undernutrition, so&#13;
with landlessness: the evidence that fewer poor people are affected than&#13;
is sometimes claimed increases the urgency and feasibility of ameliorative&#13;
action.&#13;

I. ASSETS AND FOOD-LABOR-FOOD CONVERSION&#13;
(a) Types of inequality, types of asset: adders and conversion multipliers&#13;
How different are rich people from poor people? Three useful&#13;
contrasts, which are embedded in a basic economic relationship, are in respect&#13;
to (a) dietary caloric intake relative to requirements, (b) labor use to&#13;
obtain calories and other commodities, and (c) asset ownership or control.&#13;
The contrasts may be seen by comparing the richest and poorest decile&#13;
by income-per-person in, say, rural India. 1/ The richest glutton cannot long&#13;
survive while eating double the calories needed for good health; nor the&#13;
hardiest pauper, while eating half. Thus, in respect of (a), inequality&#13;
between richest and poorest deciles cannot long exceed 4 to 1. 2/ In respect&#13;
of (b), over 90 percent of adult men normally work at least 200 days a year in&#13;
rural India in both deciles; women usually work in the poorest decile, rarely&#13;
in the richest; and, of course, the search-costs, effort, and unpleasantness&#13;
of work are much greater for the poorest. Yet, if the disutility of labor per&#13;
person-year could be quantified, the bottom decile in rural India would&#13;
probably not exceed the top decile in this respect by as much as 20 to 1. 3/&#13;
However, the difference between the deciles in respect of a major aspect of&#13;
(c), financial plus physical capital assets owned per household, was in 1971-2&#13;
over 294 to 1 (Pathak et al., 1977, p. 507).&#13;
The relationship between dietary caloric adequacy, labor use, and&#13;
asset ownership has two facets. First, assets permit the household that&#13;
controls 4/ them (i) to add to the results of, or (ii) to multiply the&#13;
conversion efficiency 5/ of, its caloric intake, via labor, into income and&#13;
hence into edible calories and other commodities. Second, a household&#13;
accumulates (or controls) assets to the extent that it obtains, and uses for&#13;
that purpose, a surplus of commodities -- obtained by converting "raw" labor,&#13;
and perhaps by multiplying or adding to the efficiency of such conversion by&#13;
using assets - over dietary needs. Diagram 1 (p. 46) illustrates the&#13;
"multiplier" and "adder" roles of asset control in determining the extent to&#13;
which a household can convert labor into food basics, surplus, and hence both&#13;
poverty (or affluence) now, and the extra assets that can reduce future risks&#13;
of poverty.&#13;
The diagram shows the role of four sorts of asset: human, financial,&#13;
durable consumer (the family home, bicycle, etc), and real producer ("land"&#13;
and "real capital", in most uses of those terms).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o Human capital can yield returns only if used in conjunction with&#13;
labor, hired out or on own account; thus skills and knowledge (and&#13;
the education that brings them) always comprise a "multiplier" of&#13;
the efficiency with which dietary calories are converted, via&#13;
labor, into purchasing-power over needed calories, leaving a&#13;
surplus for optional consumption and further asset acquisition.&#13;
o Conversely, both financial assets and durable consumer assets&#13;
always comprise an "adder" to income (value of necessary calories,&#13;
other consumption, and saving) produced by labor; the amount added&#13;
need not be constant, 6/ but is not normally affected by the&#13;
amount or hourly returns of labor, or by the efficiency of direct&#13;
conversion of labor into calories and surplus.&#13;
o Owned physical production assets, like human (but unlike&#13;
financial) capital, can be used as multipliers of the dietary&#13;
calories purchasable from an hour of work (because they upgrade&#13;
the productivity of that work) -- or of hours of work performable&#13;
per 1,000 calories eaten (because machines, like skills, can&#13;
reduce the physical effort per hour of given productivity). This&#13;
multiplicative use of owned producer capital can take place either&#13;
in one's own family enterprise, or when the equipment is hired out&#13;
with one's labor, as when an employee hires out his oxen alongside&#13;
his ploughing labor. Alternatively, owned physical assets, like&#13;
financial (but unlike human) capital, can be loaned to others, for&#13;
fixed or equity-based rent or interest, and in that role such&#13;
assets are adders to the welfare generated for a household by its&#13;
food-labor-food conversion process.&#13;
Poor people are conventionally characterized as having very few&#13;
assets. Yet we are very ignorant of the relationship between the value and&#13;
structure of a household's assets and the probability that household members&#13;
are poor or ultra-poor (Lipton, 1983). A few general truths do emerge:&#13;
primary education is generally, and increasingly, distributed less unequally&#13;
than physical assets; smallstock, and sometimes milch cattle, are likelier to&#13;
be owned by the poor than rural land; 7/ farmland, however, is the main asset&#13;
owned by the rural poor, and housing by the urban poor; and so on.    But we&#13;
cannot do more than speculate about differences between ultra-poor, poor and&#13;
non-poor in respect to the supply or demand curves of the four main types of&#13;
asset: physical producer capital, human capital, durable consumer goods,&#13;
financial claims. Still less do we know how such differences are linked to&#13;
the roles of such assets - multiplicative (skills), additive (financial,&#13;
consumer), or optional (producer) - in respect of the calories-labor-calories&#13;
conversion process. Despite persuasive arguments that, in most developing&#13;
countries, asset redistribution from growth represents the most promising&#13;
feasible route towards reducing poverty, 8/ we are extremely ignorant about&#13;
what assets poor and ultra-poor people are relatively likely to own, to manage&#13;
with high returns, or to retain.&#13;
This paper on land seeks to present evidence on one type of assets&#13;
controlled, under different circumstances, by various poor groups; hardly ever&#13;
can we present a balance sheet of total assets and liabilities, in enough&#13;
detail to compare their structure in (say) poorest, fifth, and richest income-&#13;
per-person deciles. In no case, so far as the author has discovered, can we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
show how income-per-person deciles differ in respect of their supply or demand&#13;
functions for different sorts of assets. What sorts of assets are relatively&#13;
readily accessible to (relatively low supply price for), or attractive to&#13;
(profitability and hence demand high for), groups of persons at different risk&#13;
of poverty? We do not know. As for the simpler facts of distribution, we&#13;
know most about land.&#13;
(b) Asset control, poverty protection, and risks of piecemeal analysis&#13;
This paper will thus ask: to what extent, if any, do, or could, the&#13;
Third Word's poor and ultra-poor own or control the land asset? To what&#13;
extent do the returns to the asset, if it is owned or controlled by the&#13;
potentially poor, (a) protect them from poverty, (b) differ from the returns&#13;
when the asset is controlled by the non-poor?&#13;
This asset-by-asset approach, with heavy concentration on rural assets&#13;
and especially land, is forced on us by data limitations. It raises, however,&#13;
two serious problems -- apart from the neglect of positive, or (less&#13;
plausibly) negative, correlations between the probabilities of control over&#13;
different sorts of asset. First, if a person does not own some types of asset,&#13;
especially types with imperfect or expensively-accessed markets, that person's&#13;
net yield from combining his labor with other assets may be substantially&#13;
reduced. Thus education may impart skills, not readily hireable from others,&#13;
enabling a farmer to increase net returns from land (Jamison and Lau, 1982;&#13;
Chaudhri, 1979); or lack of owned oxen, in conjunction with imperfect markets&#13;
in draught-power, may so reduce the return to owner-operated farmland as to&#13;
induce the landowner to rent out (Pant, 1981, p. 16; Jodha, 1980, pp. 20-22).&#13;
Second, just because a group of poor people, A, increases its control&#13;
over some asset and (whatever the causal sequence) also reduces its incidence&#13;
of poverty, we cannot be sure that poverty also declines in the society of&#13;
which those people are a part. Trivially, group A may have obtained more X at&#13;
the expense of another poor or near-poor group, B, whose incidence of poverty&#13;
rises; or A may increase ownership of asset X in the same process that reduces&#13;
B's ownership of another asset Y. But suppose that X increases for A (so that&#13;
A's poverty falls), and that the volume of X and of each other asset, owned by&#13;
every other actually or potentially poor group B, C..., stays constant or&#13;
rises. Nevertheless, the value of those assets may fall. Consider the asset&#13;
"literacy". If half a nation's adults are literate, the literates' incidence&#13;
of poverty is likely to be less than among the illiterate, because poverty and&#13;
illiteracy help cause one another. If a further 25 percent of the adults&#13;
become literate, but nothing else happens to the nation's capital stock or to&#13;
technology, then those 25 percent probably also reduce their risk of poverty&#13;
(both because lesser poverty helped some to acquire literacy, and because&#13;
literacy helped others to escape poverty). But the newly-literate 25 percent&#13;
may well increase the poverty risk for the 50 percent of "old literates" with&#13;
whose skills they compete - a higher supply of literacy, given the demand&#13;
function, lowers the return to it. As for the 25 percent of "still&#13;
illiterate" adults, such assets as they have (e.g. tools complementary with&#13;
unskilled effort) may become less valuable, because literates now supply more,&#13;
competing, skills and methods. Positive complementarities (in which literates&#13;
pull up the productivity of illiterates, e.g. by supervising them better) are&#13;
possible too, of course, but less likely if major non-human assets -- land,&#13;
ploughs, factories -- function as fixed factors. Analogously, a road to market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
may reduce the incidence of poverty among people in roadside villages - but,&#13;
if this is done by diverting fertilizer inputs (or lorries to market) away&#13;
from other villages, poverty there may increase.&#13;
(c) Asset redistribution and poverty&#13;
A good case can be made for looking at either end of the scale &#13;
access to dietary calories, or access to assets to multiply (or add to) the&#13;
results of the calories-labor-calories conversion process - to examine the&#13;
characteristics of the poor and ultra-poor. The ultra-poor spend 60-70&#13;
percent of income on the cheapest dietary calories they can get (Lipton,&#13;
1983), so from the standpoint of those people it makes some sense to see&#13;
calorie adequacy as the main poverty indicator. Conversely, the question,&#13;
"How little work need a person do to be adequately fed?", is an appealing one,&#13;
when measuring freedom from poverty (drudgery as well as hunger) and access to&#13;
surplus (optional consumption as well as savings); yet the answer to that&#13;
question depends largely on the assets, multiplying as well as adding to that&#13;
person's calories-labor-calories conversion process (and social as well as&#13;
private), accessible to the person. Calories are less unequally distributed&#13;
than food, food than consumption, consumption than income, and income than&#13;
assets. Hence, as we have seen, the richest decile can well be, at most, four&#13;
times better placed than the poorest to meet calorie requirements for a full&#13;
and active life -- yet three hundred times better placed in respect of asset&#13;
ownership.&#13;
This latter vast discrepancy naturally focuses, upon asset&#13;
redistribution, the attention of fighters of wars against poverty. Merely by&#13;
taking one percent of the richest decile's assets, one could apparently&#13;
multiply the poorest decile's fourfold. Even if the yield on those assets&#13;
fell -- and it might well rise 9/ - would that not eliminate most poverty, at&#13;
negligible welfare cost?   On the other side of the account, as it were, does&#13;
not the economic inequality of asset distribution in most developing countries&#13;
condemn the poor to a worsening situation, at least relatively, because (a)&#13;
they are very much less likely than the rich to be able to acquire an economic&#13;
surplus, (b) their existing low surplus compels them to select low-risk, and&#13;
hence low-return, homes for such little saving as they can muster?&#13;
Our piecemeal examination of bitty data will largely skirt these&#13;
issues. But it does cast two shafts of doubt upon the implications above.&#13;
First, asset ownership turns out, where evidence is available (which is&#13;
seldom), to be much more life-cyclic than income. Second, high assets are&#13;
strongly associated with large households. Lifelong assets per person are&#13;
probably very much less unequal than point observations upon assets per&#13;
household might suggest. Yet these observations are all we usually get.&#13;
&#13;

II. POVERTY AND ACCESS TO LAND&#13;
(a) Where access to land might affect poverty less&#13;
Are rural people significantly less likely to be poor if they have&#13;
access 1O/ to farmland? The question cannot arise within any region where&#13;
rights in land are allocated in more or less egalitarian fashion. Also,&#13;
landlessness is unlikely to be associated with poverty if land is not&#13;
scarce. If land is both scarce and allocated according to economic or&#13;
political power, then rural poverty is likely to be associated with&#13;
landholding below a certain threshold (which falls as land quality rises).&#13;
That association weakens to the extent that non-farm jobs or assets are&#13;
readily available to, and offer comparable rewards to cultivation for, persons&#13;
with little or no access to farmland.&#13;
1. Where allocation of land rights is egalitarian&#13;
(i) Customary tenure&#13;
Studies of law and custom in African societies often claim that tribal&#13;
authority or practice assigns to each family, or to each adult male, a&#13;
cultivable area (settled or slash-and-burn) of a size dictated by the family's&#13;
needs or by its available family labor. Land sales, rentals, and settlement&#13;
by non-tribals are all, to varying degrees, supposedly restricted by such&#13;
systems, and tribal authorities are often claimed to reposssess and reallocate&#13;
a family's land when the father dies.&#13;
In practice, these latter rights are hardly ever enforcible. Nor, as&#13;
land acquires commercial value, are traditional authorities able and willing&#13;
to prevent commercial transactions. The author has observed, in pre-&#13;
revolutionary Ethiopia, how a myriad of complex quasi-feudal and religious&#13;
tenures boiled down in practice to leasehold arid freehold; and also how&#13;
similar circumstances increasingly prevailed in Botswana in the late 1970s.&#13;
Many others have made similar observations. The increasingly formal and empty&#13;
nature in practice of the above juridical model of much "communal land tenure"&#13;
in Africa was analyzed over twenty-five years ago (FAO, 1953). Even in West&#13;
Africa, overt freehold is sharply on the increase (Goddard, 1970; Luning,&#13;
1965).&#13;
(ii) Collectives&#13;
Traditional egalitarian tenure, where it ever existed -- and accounts&#13;
of it frequently "smell" of golden-age myth, rather than of fieldwork -- is&#13;
disappearing as population densities, commercial relationships, and modern&#13;
states advance. However, in some countries, "modern" forms of collective or&#13;
co-operative land allocation on an egalitarian basis have become impor-&#13;
tant. 11/ Do such systems decouple poverty from inadequate access to land?&#13;
Little will be said here about this question, mainly for lack of evidence.    We&#13;
briefly consider collectives, co-operatives, and common property rights.&#13;
In China, a radically redistributive land reform was followed by a&#13;
shift towards collective agricultural management, and more recently by&#13;
substantial restoration of individual incentives and possibly rights. The&#13;
first of these three changes drastically equalized intra-household incomes&#13;
within particular localities, and the two subsequent changes appear to have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
left this equalization virtually unaffected (workpoints did little to generate&#13;
new intra-rural inequalities). Within work teams, and to a lesser extent&#13;
brigades and even communes, access to public and private land, and hence&#13;
income per person, has since the first reform (1948-53) been remarkably equal&#13;
(Khan, 1977, pp. 258-71; Khan and Lee, 1983, esp. pp. 55, 118-22). However,&#13;
these findings relate to irrigated areas, and echo other findings that a&#13;
little irrigated land appears to ensure against extreme poverty (pp.11-14).&#13;
The distribution among communes, and even more among rural areas, shows much&#13;
inequality, and a prolonged regional famine in the early 1960s claimed&#13;
millions of lives (Sen, 1983; Khan, 1977, pp. 269-70; White and Nolan,&#13;
1984). This indicates (a) that, in China as elsewhere (pp. 14-19), access to&#13;
a small amount of bad or badly-watered land is not much better at preventing&#13;
poverty than is "landless labor"; or (b) that "collective consumption", to&#13;
raise the relative living standards of poorer areas, must have been very&#13;
limited; or (c) that possible efficiency losses (due to collectivization,&#13;
cultural revolution, etc.) may in such areas substantially offset the equity&#13;
gains from land reform.&#13;
(iii) Co-operatives&#13;
In Latin America, there are persistent and apparently well-informed&#13;
suggestions -- though not much evidence -- that co-operative farming systems,&#13;
while successfully redistributing rights in land to formerly poor tenants,&#13;
have been accompanied by characteristically big-farm, labor-displacing&#13;
management practices. Such practices are designed to secure the welfare of&#13;
the (now not-so-poor) co-operators. However, this is achieved at the expense&#13;
of potentially ultra-poor landless laborers -- often homeless migrants - who&#13;
lose their jobs to tractors and combine harvesters. In combination with&#13;
preferential credit arrangements for co-operators, which neglected the even&#13;
poorer minifundistas (and totally excluded the much poorer laborers), this&#13;
has, in the Peruvian case, almost certainly led to a worsening in the incomes&#13;
of the poorest (Alberts, 1981, pp. 170-2). It would be wrong to blame land&#13;
redistribution from rich to moderately-poor for the harm to the poorest; blame&#13;
appears to attach to inappropriate, and often imposed or subsidized, systems&#13;
of large-scale mechanized co-operative farming.&#13;
In India (and elsewhere in South Asia) there have been occasional&#13;
experiments with voluntary co-operative joint farming, supported by initial&#13;
public-sector investments in land and water improvement. Such experiments, as&#13;
in Latin America, have sometimes been based on in ill-advised attempts to&#13;
subsidize large scale, centralization, and mechanization in traditional&#13;
agricultures. However, there are interesting and apparently successful&#13;
exceptions, typically where a substantial part of village land, after&#13;
improvement, has been divided among small groups, which retain most of their&#13;
output, in effect exchanging the remainder with the Society for shared&#13;
services. In 1963-4, in four villages of Kaira District, Gujarat, some 248&#13;
members (in 20 groups) reported ten years of apparently favorable, and largely&#13;
unsubsidized, experience with this system. Most of the cultivators were&#13;
initially landless, but had farmed previously (they had been flooded out); 88&#13;
of the 102 members from the main participating villiage, Kothiakad, were from&#13;
the dominant Rajput caste, as against 66 of the 99 non-member households&#13;
(Bambal, 1966, pp. 31-42). Despite the known weaknesses of such arrangements&#13;
-- notably the drift of benefits to the less-poor and more-powerful, noticable&#13;
here also -- clear gains to the landless and near-landless poor, though not to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the poorest, do seem to have materialized. An interestingly analogous case is&#13;
reported from Romania: use of nuclear families as spontaneous organizers of&#13;
labor, each benefiting from its own inputs and organization, appears to have&#13;
increased both efficiency and perceived benefit in co-operative farming&#13;
(Cernea, 1975).&#13;
(iv) Common property rights&#13;
A third form of egalitarian rights in land involves common property&#13;
rights (CPRs). These can inhibit poverty by providing equal access to grazing&#13;
land, wild foods for gathering, firewood, and (rarely) hunting. CPRs are&#13;
always under twin threat, from population increase and from "the tragedy of&#13;
the commons". 12/ These threats sharpen as the state - in eighteenth-century&#13;
England, in Rajasthan since the 1950s, or in Botswana to support the oddly-&#13;
named "Tribal Grazing Lands Program" 13/ -- switches support from the&#13;
maintenance of CPRs to their replacement, through enclosure of common land, by&#13;
individual ownership and rights to privately marketable usufruct.&#13;
Jodha has collected dramatic evidence, for two villages in each of two&#13;
districts of Rajasthan (Nagaur and Jodhpur), of the decline of CPRs between&#13;
1953-4 and 1972-3. In the Nagaur villages, common grazing fell from 58&#13;
percent of all grazing land to 28 percent, and in Jodhpur from 56 percent to&#13;
29 percent. Animal watering points fell from 10 to 8 and from 17 to 9&#13;
respectively. Of the 588 ha. of CPRs "privatized" over two decades in the&#13;
four villages, only 12 percent were acquired by persons previously landless&#13;
(i.e. previously reliant on access to the 100 percent of CPR area), a further&#13;
12 percent by small farmers (below 5 ha.), and just over 60 percent by farmers&#13;
with over 10 ha. before acquisition (Jodha, 1983, Tables 4, 6, 7).&#13;
The consequences must have been most serious for the poor, who have&#13;
fewer private property rights. In 1972-3, in six villages in Rajasthan, CPRs&#13;
comprised 42 percent of gross farm income for "laborers and small farmers",&#13;
but only 15 percent for "large farmers" (Jodha, 1983a, p. 8). Given the role&#13;
of market forces and of State-sanctioned "enclosures" in the privatization of&#13;
common land -- and the increased degradation of the remaining commons,&#13;
squeezed between growing human (and animal) populations and declining non-&#13;
privatized areas -- CPRs, like tribal allocation, promise little protection to&#13;
the poorest.&#13;
A serious special problem is created for tribals, tenants, and other&#13;
land operators without title (and generally likelier to be poor) in the wake&#13;
of irrigation schemes, ranching enclosures, or other developments. Such&#13;
people are seldom compensated, yet lose the land they farmed. Often -- as&#13;
with slash-and-burn cropping, or transhumance -- their land uses are&#13;
completely overlooked by the development agencies.&#13;
2. Where reliance on non-farming is high or rising fast&#13;
I. Singh (1981) remarks that "landlessness" in rural India may be good&#13;
or bad (and its growth therefore an improvement or a deterioration) according&#13;
to whether the "landless" are able to rely (increasingly) on income from non-&#13;
farm labor or assets. Even in fairly stagnant rural areas of Northern&#13;
Nigeria, those with no, or small, holdings - and reliant on non-farm&#13;
activity -- are often the best off. The correlation between land owned and&#13;
monthly expenditure per person (MEP) is thus very weak there (Simmons, 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
In India in 1977-8, the proportion of rural households mainly&#13;
dependent on non-farm incomes was only 19.4 percent in Bihar, 21.7 percent in&#13;
Gujarat, and 22.1 percent in Maharashtra, and 24.9 percent in Andhra -- but&#13;
27.8 percent in West Bengal, 29.6 percent in Tamil Nadu, 28.3 percent in&#13;
Haryana, and 30.9 percent in the Punjab (Sarvekshana, 1982). Non-farm&#13;
households were much less liable to poverty levels of MEP. In the last four&#13;
States, landlessness is being de-linked, to some degree, from poverty.&#13;
3. Where land is less scarce&#13;
Related to the steady individualization of Third World land rights --&#13;
a process linked, in turn, to the erosion or enclosure of rights to graze, to&#13;
gather wild foods, and otherwise to enjoy once-common property (Jodha, 1983&#13;
and 1983a, for India; Hitchcock, 1979, for Botswana) - is the increasing&#13;
scarcity value of land. Population growth, the slow and not very job-creating&#13;
nature of industrialization, and sometimes "loss of ground" (especially to&#13;
erosion: Eckholm, 1976) and a shift of demand from cereals to land-extensive&#13;
meat and dairy products, 14/ have combined to raise demand for land, in&#13;
efficiency-units, relatively to supply, even in areas where land was until&#13;
quite recently thought to be plentiful. The process is intensified by the&#13;
existence of non-land constraints or near-constraints 15/ (e.g. on security&#13;
against theft for too-remote plots; on seasonal labor for bird-scaring) which&#13;
increase the attractiveness of intensifying the use of existing land, rather&#13;
than cultivating more (Lipton, 1979a). Land really worth farming,&#13;
increasingly, is almost everywhere scarce.&#13;
If land is scarce, and not generally allocated through effective&#13;
egalitarian systems, it is plausible that lack of adequate access to land&#13;
rights and rural poverty are associated. Seven in ten South Asians, perhaps&#13;
eight in ten Africans, depend mainly on agriculture for a livelihood. Only in&#13;
a few "bright spots" is the ratio, by value, of fixed and variable capital&#13;
inputs to land inputs high in these agricultures. Land, therefore, is&#13;
overwhelmingly the main rural productive asset by value.&#13;
(b) Normal-year poverty not reduced by micro-holding on "bad" land&#13;
Yet a fairly clear line can be drawn between places where access to&#13;
two or three acres is associated with greatly reduced risk of poverty, and&#13;
places where those who rely on labor-power alone are not significantly&#13;
likelier to be poor than those who work small landholdings. Many readers of&#13;
Visaria (1978) were surprised by his findings on this matter (reproduced here&#13;
as Table 1) for rural Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1972-3. The proportion of&#13;
"all households" below the poverty line 16/ does not clearly decline, as owned&#13;
landholding rises, between the landless and those with above 7.5 acres in&#13;
rural Gujarat, and above 10 acres in Maharashtra. This applies also to the&#13;
separate occupational groups. 19 percent of households in rural Gujarat&#13;
depended mainly on income from farm labor in 1972-3, and 34 percent in rural&#13;
Maharashtra; respective figures for households dependent mainly on cultivation&#13;
were 63 percent and 46 percent. Of these four groups, only cultivation-&#13;
dependent households in Maharashtra, and those only as holding size rose&#13;
between 1 and 5 acres, showed a clearly falling poverty incidence as&#13;
"landedness" rose. Other occupational groups -- artisans, government&#13;
employees, etc. -- 4aso showed no clear linkage between poverty and&#13;
landholding until ownership became really substantial, but this is less&#13;
surprising than for farmers and farm laborers (Visaria, 1978, pp. 14-15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
This phenomenon -- that in poor areas, where land is unirrigated and&#13;
not reliably rainfed, people in households owning to 3-10 acres are as&#13;
seriously at risk of poverty as the landless - has been quite widely&#13;
observed, both for ownership and for operational holdings. Using the latter&#13;
definition, the ICRISAT study of six villages found that "medium and small-&#13;
farm and landless-labor households...had average net per capita incomes across&#13;
villages and cropping years that were almost the same" (Singh, Asokan and&#13;
Walker, 1982, p.26). In Botswana, only really large holdings provided&#13;
increased insurance against poverty (Watanabe and Mueller, 1982, Table 3). In&#13;
poor regions of both north-east Thailand and northern Nigeria, farm and non-&#13;
farm income were strongly negatively correlated, so that once again farm size&#13;
was unlinked to freedom from poverty except in the largest size groups&#13;
(Priebprom, cited by Meyer and Alicbusan, 1983, p. 16; Simmons, 1976). Among&#13;
274 farmers in 14 villages of Kwara State, Nigeria, in 1973, income per person&#13;
-- perhaps because positively and significantly correlated with the&#13;
proportion of household income from non-farm sources - showed absolutely no&#13;
significant relationship to farm size, even though (unusually, and laudably)&#13;
that was measured per person (Olayide and Essang, n.d.).&#13;
One looks, first, to demographic explanations. In rural Gujarat in&#13;
1972-3, households dependent mainly on farm labor income averaged 5.0 persons&#13;
if landless, rising steadily to 7.0 persons where 5-7.5 acres were owned; the&#13;
comparable rise for rural Maharashtra was from 4.3 to 6.2 persons. Mainly&#13;
cultivation-dependent households steadily rose in average size from 5.1 if&#13;
they owned up to 1 acre to 6.1 (5-7.5 acres) in rural Gujarat, and from 3.3 to&#13;
5.3 in rural Maharashtra (Visaria, 1978, p. 87). 17/ These increases are&#13;
significant -- we return to the implication for the land-poverty nexus below&#13;
-- and do mean that the middle-range landowners had to feed more mouths than&#13;
the near-landless. But the effect is much too small to account for the&#13;
virtual identity, not just of the proportions of households below an&#13;
inevitably arbitrary poverty-line in each of the five land-ownership groups&#13;
from zero to 7.5 acres, but also of the decile-wise distribution of monthly&#13;
outlay per person in each group. 18/&#13;
Another possible demographic explanation, for the absence of a link&#13;
between lowered risk of poverty and escape from landlessness in these and&#13;
other semi-arid areas (Singh, Asokan and Walker, 1982, p. 26, for Indian&#13;
villages) is life-cyclical. Perhaps the landless tend to be young, active,&#13;
and with many earners and few dependants, whereas these conditions are less&#13;
common as one advances up the scale of landholding toward 5-7.5 acres? In&#13;
rural Gujarat in 1972-3, the proportion of household heads aged under 29 --&#13;
almost all over 15 -- indeed fell steadily from 23 percent among the landless,&#13;
to 10 percent among owners of 5-7.5 acres; rural Maharashtra was similar.&#13;
However, the dependency ratio (persons not aged 15-59 as a proportion of&#13;
persons aged 15-59) seems also to decline over this range of increased&#13;
landholdings in rural Gujarat. There, too, the proportion of person-days&#13;
spent in workforce participation rises from 38 percent for the landless (55.5&#13;
percent for persons aged over ten) to 42.7 percent (61.0 percent) for&#13;
households owning 5-7.5 acres; and, as in rural India as a whole, the&#13;
proportion of participant-days spent in involuntary unemployment falls&#13;
sharply, from 13-15 percent to 3-4 percent, over this range (Visaria, 1978,&#13;
pp. 102, 105, 109, 113). Demographic structures appear to make it more&#13;
surprising that small and medium-small landowners are, on average, in these&#13;
areas at no greater risk of falling into the poorest income deciles than are&#13;
those who own no land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Two possible statistical explanations can also be dismissed. It might&#13;
be the case that holdings below 5-7.5 acres were on much better land than were&#13;
larger holdings, so that, if allowance were made for quality, the expected&#13;
relationship between a landholding, even a small one, and lowered poverty risk&#13;
would be re-established. Or it might be the case that some places, within&#13;
these big States, featured 5-7.5 acre holdings, bad land, and poverty, while&#13;
other places featured 0.5-5 acre holdings, good land, and less poverty; if so,&#13;
it would be the aggregation into statewide NSS samples which produced an&#13;
illusion that more land, up to a 5-7.5 acre level, did not reduce poverty&#13;
risk. We can rule out these explanations, however, because the near-constancy&#13;
of poverty incidence between the landless and the small landed also appears&#13;
from several studies of single villages within Western India, and indeed from&#13;
other work in semi-arid areas.&#13;
We can be fairly confident that these non-relationships in big samples&#13;
over large areas, between poverty incidence and access to smallish amounts of&#13;
bad land, are not accidents of "ecological fallacy" (Dasgupta, 1977). This is&#13;
because successive localized disaggregations do not appear to restore a link&#13;
between poverty and landlessness. First, Visaria himself regionally&#13;
disaggregates his big samples -- 5563 households for rural Gujarat, 5329 for&#13;
rural Maharashtra - into, respectively, five and six zones, each with eight&#13;
landowning groups (from zero to over 20 acres). In Gujarat, the proportion of&#13;
landholders in poverty - below Rs.38.90 MEP in 1972-3 -- begins clearly to&#13;
fall with increasing holding size only above 7.5 acres in two zones, and above&#13;
5 acres in two; only in one zone, the Northern Plains, is there a consistent&#13;
inverse relationship between incidence of poverty and land owned per&#13;
household. In Maharashtra, not one zone shows such a relationship for the&#13;
landless and smallest farmers; it begins at 5 acres in two zones, at 7.5 in&#13;
one, and in three zones not until ten acres are owned (Visaria, 1978, pp. 10-&#13;
11).&#13;
Second, other work has disaggregated to a much lower level, and has&#13;
looked at farmland-poverty relationships for villages over several years&#13;
(Visaria's findings for Gujarat might be partly due to the fact that 1972-3&#13;
was a drought year in some places, since drought seems to reduce income more&#13;
than in proportion to farm size: Desai et al., 1979).    In six semi-arid&#13;
villages averaged over three years (1975-6 to 1977-8), income per person&#13;
averaged Rs.393 in households operating below 0.2 ha., Rs.388 for "small", Rs.&#13;
398 for "medium", and Rs.730 for "large" farms; not one village showed income-&#13;
per-person increasing both from the group operating no land (or below 0.2 ha.)&#13;
to "small" operators and from "small" to "medium" (Singh et al., 1982, p. 18).&#13;
In two villages of Chengalpattu District, Tamilnadu, consumption expenditure&#13;
in 1976 per household averaged Rs.1965 for 104 "landless peasant households"&#13;
(38 non-landowning, but farming 0.25-1 acre of leased-in land; plus 66 without&#13;
operational holdings but living mainly from farmwork); Rs.1974 for 55 "petty&#13;
peasant" households (owning below 2 acres and operating below 5 acres); and&#13;
Rs.2191 for 25 "medium peasants" operating 5-10 acres (Shivakumar, 1978, pp.&#13;
762-3, and 1978a, p. 817); household size is not given, but we know enough&#13;
about the generally larger household size of bigger landholdings to be fairly&#13;
confident that the small differences among "landless, petty, and middle&#13;
peasants" in incomes-per-person were not significant at 5 percent.&#13;
Still in largely rainfed areas of India, a cross-sectional study of&#13;
ten villages in Central Gujarat (B. Singh, 1980, pp. 101, 106) suggests that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
small operational holdings conduce to poverty much less if they.are are&#13;
typical of a village, than when brought about by intra-village inequality.&#13;
The proportion of village households too poor to afford 2250 calories per&#13;
consumer unit daily correlated, across the ten villages, (a) significantly at&#13;
1 percent (r=.723) with each village's Gini coefficient of operated&#13;
landholdings, but (b) not significantly with the average size of holding, per&#13;
consumer unit, in operating households (B. Singh, 1980, pp. 101-5). The three&#13;
villages with most unequal operational landholdings (on several measures) show&#13;
highly significantly more and severer poverty than the other seven villages,&#13;
and hence a higher "Sen index" (B. Singh, 1981, pp. 206-10, 225-9).&#13;
(c)  Good land in small amounts reduces normal-year' poverty risk&#13;
Thus the move from landlessness up to 3-10 semi-arid rainfed acres,&#13;
depending on land quality, does not greatly reduce a household's risk of&#13;
poverty. Neither demography, nor the (anyway very doubtful) view that smaller&#13;
farms comprise "better" land, accounts for this fact. If Singh's work, just&#13;
cited, is confirmed in other studies, it may be that large holdings adopt&#13;
crop-mixes, machines, or low cropping-intensities that displace labor from&#13;
both the landless and the deficit farms; but it is not clear why the latter&#13;
two groups should be reduced to similar levels of indigence.&#13;
The explanation may well depend critically on the following probable&#13;
fact (evidence for which is given below). A little land fails to cut poverty&#13;
risk in an average year - though it may still reduce the effort needed to&#13;
secure a given (low) income, or to provide a critical reserve in a year of bad&#13;
harvest - only where farming is mostly extensive, unimproved, and without&#13;
water control. There, a deficit or small surplus farm is frequently (to use&#13;
the terminology of writers on eighteenth-century English farming) an&#13;
"encumbrance"; elsewere, a "competency" that indeed sharply reduces the risk,&#13;
in a typical year, of falling into indigence. The importance of this&#13;
"competency" is suggested by evidence from three Indian regions of intensive,&#13;
water-controlled, and increasingly modern farming: the Punjab, coastal Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, and West Bengal.&#13;
In the Punjab, from 1963-4 to 1973-4, the incidences of poverty,&#13;
ultra-poverty, and an intermediate measure 19/ showed clear, substantial&#13;
downtrends (though with major fluctuations: see Mundle, 1982, pp. 7, 10).&#13;
Yet, in a State-wide inquiry in 1974-5, of 140 sampled households depending on&#13;
cultivation as their main source of income but operating 0.1 to 2.5 acres,&#13;
31.4 percent were below the poverty line - as against "only" 23.6 percent of&#13;
326 operating 2.5 to 5 acres, and 19.1 percent of 404 operating 5 to 7.5 acres&#13;
(Bhalla and Chadha, 1982, p. 826, and 1982a, pp. 875-6). Households depending&#13;
on farm labor as their main source of income showed "real wage rates&#13;
fluctuating [in the range of Rs.2.50 to Rs.3.50 at 1960-61 prices] without a&#13;
sustained tendency to rise or fall" from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s&#13;
(Mundle, 1982, pp. 27, 29). Annual days of employment, while available only&#13;
for a few years, showed no uptrend. This has left real wage income per male&#13;
agricultural laborer, from farm and non-farm labor together, in rural Punjab&#13;
and Haryana roughly constant ever since the mid-1950s (ibid., pp. 31-3).&#13;
Unless distribution among agricultural laborers improved, therefore, their&#13;
incidence of poverty can have fallen only if there was a rise in the income of&#13;
those laborers who derived some 20/ income from operating or renting out land,&#13;
or if the employee/consumer ratio rose sharply. The 47 percent rise in real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
annual income of farmworkers operating no land between 1964-5 jand 1974-5&#13;
presumably goes with a sharp rise in small-scale renting-out (see p. 21&#13;
below), but it is notable that if such workers operated land their real annual&#13;
income rose much faster, by 79 percent.&#13;
Indeed, in Punjab and Haryana in 1964-5, when really small farm&#13;
operators were not so different from those in less-favored States, farm-labor&#13;
households averaged Rs.121 of income-per-person if they did not operate any&#13;
land, and marginally less, Rs.119, if they did. By 1974-5, when even tiny&#13;
farms had adopted modern seed-fertilizer packages, respective figures were&#13;
Rs.178 and Rs.213 - almost 20 percent more for laborers with a "competency"&#13;
(Mundle, 1982, p.34). By the mid-1970s, whether a Punjabi household depended&#13;
mainly on farm labor or on cultivation, any increase in its operational&#13;
landholding was likely to reduce the risk of poverty substantially.&#13;
In micro-surveys among households mainly dependent on rural employment&#13;
income in the rich, irrigated soils of West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
land ownership was associated, significantly at 1 percent, with absence of&#13;
poverty (i.e. income-per-head above Rs.300 - i.e. 500 kgs. of paddy, in 1972-&#13;
3: Parthasarathy, 1977, pp. 44-5). An extra acre raised the laborer&#13;
household's income-per-person by Rs.210. A large part of the reason is that&#13;
involuntary unemployment comprised a much larger proportion of time for&#13;
laborer households without than with land, especially in the less-busy rabi&#13;
season (Parthasarathy and Rama Rao, 1973, p. A-12). In the 1972 inquiry into&#13;
farm labor households, in ten villages, 28 of 68 non-landowning households&#13;
enjoyed less than Rs. 250 of yearly income - as against 2 of the 32&#13;
landowning households (ibid., p. A-126) - despite the obvious fact that&#13;
holdings of this generally good land must have been tiny, relative to a&#13;
household's size, to compel it to rely mainly on labor income. The contrast&#13;
,to the largely unirrigated and semi-arid areas could hardly be sharper.&#13;
In West Bengal, for agricultural labour households (i.e. 50 percent or&#13;
more of income from agricultural wages), the probability of falling below the&#13;
poverty line - Rs. 15 per head at 1960 prices - declines significantly with&#13;
the size of cultivated area of the household. For the primarily cultivator&#13;
households, this probability again declines with cultivated area, but&#13;
increases with the square of cultivated area (Bardhan, personal communication,&#13;
1984, referring to Bardhan, 1984). Hence farm labourers - who farm very&#13;
little land anyway - improve their chances of escaping poverty by doing so;&#13;
and for cultivators, while plainly those with less land are poorer than those&#13;
with more, the anti-poverty impact per acre of a little land seems to be&#13;
greater than that of much land. Bardhan (personal communication) suggests&#13;
that this may "indicate some effect of the standard inverse relationship&#13;
between size and productivity" of landholding; this relationship works much&#13;
more strongly and clearly on irrigated than on unirrigated land, which may be&#13;
another reason for the sharp contrast between these three States and the&#13;
results obtained by the Visaria for the less-irrigated States of Western&#13;
India. Anyway, in the three Indian States discussed in the last paragraphs -&#13;
where much land is irrigated, improved, and/or sown to high-yielding crop&#13;
varieties - access to even a little typical land considerably reduces the&#13;
probability of poverty. In poorer places it does not. In intermediate cases,&#13;
the advantage of the small landed over the landless is not massive but is&#13;
extant. In 1965-6, in Matar Taluka, Gujarat, farm laborers averaged monthly&#13;
expenditure per person (MEP) worth 242 kg. of paddy, as against 305 kgs. worth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
for cultivators of 0-5 acres -- but 30 percent of the latter's Iand was&#13;
irrigated, giving them much better prospects than typical Gujarat smallholders&#13;
(Shah and Shah, 1974, pp. 78, 248). At all-India level, the upshot is clearly&#13;
reflected in Table 2 (taken from Sundaram and Tendulkar, 1983, p. 59). Of the&#13;
two main rural household groups -- those for whom the main income source was&#13;
working on land controlled by others, and those for whom it was working on&#13;
self-operated land -- the former in 1977-8 had about half the incidence of&#13;
"poverty" as defined by the NSS. Of course, a small proportion in the latter&#13;
group controlled large amounts of land; but this huge difference in the&#13;
incidence of "poverty" between cultivators and farm workers must be explained&#13;
mainly by the fact that under irrigated, improved or modern farming conditions&#13;
access to a little land is access to reduced poverty incidence in a normal&#13;
year.&#13;
This is confirmed by evidence from intensive irrigated farming areas&#13;
outside India. In a village of West Java, farm size appears to be the&#13;
overwhelming determinant of expected income, even at minute levels (Sanusi,&#13;
1982).&#13;
In a survey of 161 villages in Egypt in 1974-5, the proportion of&#13;
households with average cash outlay per household below LE 100 was 26.5&#13;
percent for "pure" farm laborers, 17.2 percent for farm operators of below&#13;
1.04 acres, and only 6 percent at 1.04-3.12 acres (Harik, 1979, pp. 109-12).&#13;
Lower subsistence income must have substantially increased, and smaller&#13;
household size somewhat reduced, this apparent 3-to-2 disadvantage of the&#13;
landless in poverty incidence as compared with even very small farmers.&#13;
In the Philippines, many small farmers, including tenants, have&#13;
escaped from poverty due to agricultural progress; but laborers, already poor,&#13;
have probably got poorer.   In Laguna, "farmers who also worked as laborers"&#13;
plainly small cultivators - "earned about three times what a purely hired&#13;
laborer earned" when surveyed in the early 1970s (J. and D. Rosenberg, 1980,&#13;
pp. 82-5). An intensive survey of 16 households in Abangay village, Iloilo&#13;
district, during the 1977-8 dry season showed consumption per consumer unit&#13;
21/ at 69.7 pesos monthly for three "young landless" households, 52.3 for five&#13;
"older landless", 77.9 for four "small" tenant farmers, and 84.6 for four&#13;
"medium" (Ledesma, 1982, pp. 22, 50).&#13;
(d) A little land versus poverty: how and why?&#13;
Access to even a little bit of land, despite being associated with&#13;
larger household size, is associated with lower probability of poverty in an&#13;
average year -- if, and only if, the land offers prospects of a reasonably&#13;
high net return per acre. If, as seems likely but is not proven, the&#13;
causation runs from "a little good land" to "lower poverty incidence", then&#13;
the above fact strengthens the equity case for land redistribution where land&#13;
is irrigated, improved, or otherwise of high quality - and weakens it&#13;
elsewhere. However, that fact is not the whole story. 22/ Might&#13;
smallholders, even if able to spend no more than landless laborers in a&#13;
typical year from their work on traditionally farmed and unimproved land, yet&#13;
have some poverty-reducing advantage over them? Anyway, why does a little&#13;
land access increase MEP if, but only if, land is improved and hence&#13;
increasingly valuable and scarce?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
These two issues probably help to explain the unforturate fact that&#13;
trends towards concentration of owned and (especially) operated farmland are&#13;
rather often demonstrable where land is irrigated, high-yielding, etc., and&#13;
not elsewhere. In other words, where in typical years farmland (increasingly)&#13;
protects against low incomes, potentially poor people increasingly lack access&#13;
to it; but where it is not worth much, their share in access to it is steady&#13;
or even increasing.&#13;
1. Land versus effort and risk&#13;
This statement needs at least two qualifications, however, because&#13;
"income (or expenditure) per consumer-unit in a typical year" omits at least&#13;
two land-related components of security against poverty. The first component&#13;
is a person's capacity to avoid wasted effort in labor markets. Unemployment&#13;
rates, search-costs, time (and calories) required in walking to, from and&#13;
among workplaces - all fall steadily as access to land rises, and are more&#13;
favorable even for micro-farmers of bad land than for those who have no&#13;
practicable alternative to laboring (J. and D. Rosenberg, 1980, pp. 48-9; B.&#13;
Singh, 1980, pp. 100-3, 106; Lipton, 1983a, pp. 44-6). The landless, even&#13;
where they achieve MEP no lower than the marginally landed, need to use up&#13;
more time, calories, and perhaps unpleasantness in achieving it.&#13;
The second component is security against fluctuations. A micro-farmer&#13;
may be no better off than landless laborers in an average year. If he owns&#13;
his farmland, however, he has a "store of wealth" that -- once -- can be sold&#13;
or mortgaged to meet dire emergency. Asset depletion in bad years, i.e. in a&#13;
buyers' market, and attempted replenishments in good years, i.e. in a sellers'&#13;
market, are likely to prove a polarizing and ultimately self-defeating way to&#13;
manage risk (for evidence of its impQrtance see Jodha, 1975, and Walker and&#13;
Jodha, 1982); but at least the micro-landowner has that option. Both he and&#13;
even the micro-tenant, moreover, can react to a bad year by substituting on-&#13;
farm family labor for labor hired from the landless, and by supplying his own&#13;
labor in competition with them. This is widely observed, even among tiny&#13;
farms on bad land. In Central America, "crop loss or low non-wage earnings&#13;
induce small farmers to temporarily migrate to the cortas to work as&#13;
harvesting laborers [; thus] the incidence of risk adjustment is partially&#13;
shifted to agricultural laborers [, who are] least able to cope with risk"&#13;
(Walker and Jodha, 1982, p. 9 ). This applies as forcibly to non-migratory&#13;
increases (in bad years) of the operating farmer's labor supply, whether to&#13;
compete with landless laborers in other people's enterprises, or to displace&#13;
them in his own. The evidence that landless laborers, not micro-farmers,&#13;
suffer worst in famine (Sen, 1981) demonstrates their inability to sell land;&#13;
to adjust labor supply upwards or demand downwards (they already sell almost&#13;
all the labor they can -- and very rarely hire labor in); or otherwise, in bad&#13;
times, to escape damage from the labor-supply adjustments made by farm&#13;
operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2. In normal years: the "inverse relationship"?&#13;
Why should one acre of operated or owned land, in a typical year, be a&#13;
much better protector against poverty levels of MEP than none, and less good&#13;
than two, on irrigated or reliably watered land, or on land farmed with modern&#13;
seed-fertilizer packages - hereafter "good land" -- and not much better than&#13;
none, nor much worse than two, on unimproved, semi-arid or otherwise&#13;
unreliably watered, and traditionally farmed land -- hereafter "bad land"?&#13;
Why, on any land, should even an acre reduce the labor requirements, and raise&#13;
the year-to-year stability, of a given, near-poverty, average annual level of&#13;
MEP?&#13;
It is easy to see why one acre does a lot to reduce normal-year&#13;
poverty risk on good land. Naively, one such acre greatly increases the&#13;
retained production of family labor if operated, and rental income if hired&#13;
out. (This need not work on bad land.) It is harder to see why, on bad land&#13;
only, one acre is no better at reducing normal-year poverty risk than three,&#13;
or on very bad lands than five, seven or even nine acres. Two possible&#13;
answers are that the "inverse relationship", between land area operated (or&#13;
owned?) and annual net value added per acre, might be stronger, or less weak,&#13;
on bad land; and that on such land the farming systems and relationships might&#13;
discourage the replacement of labor by capital. Such discouragement would,&#13;
relative to the one-acre farmer, both strengthen the landless laborer and&#13;
weaken the middle farmer.&#13;
The argument that the "inverse relationship" strengthens the one-acre&#13;
farmer's chance of avoiding poverty, relative to the 5-10 acre farmer, on bad&#13;
land only, is attractive. The original evidence for the "inverse&#13;
relationship" stemmed from the Indian Farm Management Studies of the mid-&#13;
1950s, which applied largely to unimproved rainfed farming. Some recent&#13;
district-level work (e.g. Roy, 1981) appears to suggest that the relationship&#13;
may be less clear in the most progressive areas of the Punjab.&#13;
However, when the causality of the "inverse relationship" is&#13;
unravelled, that relationship looks much weaker on bad land. The relationship&#13;
between farm acreage and net value added per acre-year is inverse -- if it is&#13;
-- not because of small size in itself, but because small acreage is&#13;
associated with family operation and labor (Rudra and Sen, 1980). Hence the&#13;
search and supervision costs, to worker and farmer alike, of applying labor to&#13;
land (and to non-land, non-labor farm inputs) are smaller, both per acre and&#13;
per worker, for the small family farmer than for the commercial farmer hiring&#13;
labor. Thus smaller holdings find it relatively more advantageous to apply&#13;
more labor to: grow higher-value crops; double-crop or improve land in the&#13;
slack season; shrink fallows in area or duration; and enhance yields, e.g. by&#13;
row-planting. Greater poverty of micro-holders also interacts with their&#13;
lower cost of job search to induce more family labor per acre absolutely, not&#13;
just relatively to hired labor, than on bigger farms (Sen, 1962, p. 246).&#13;
The scope for labor-intensifying activities - and thus for raising&#13;
the "poverty-reducing" potential of a one-acre holding, relative to that of&#13;
three or five acres -- depends, however, on the existence of alternatives.&#13;
These are much greater on good lands (provided that improvements have not&#13;
created major economies of scale, or advantages of education or access to&#13;
bulked inputs, for bigger farmers) than in bad lands. In the latter, a plot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
in a particular place is much less likely to permit a wide range of&#13;
alternatives regarding cropping pattern or intensity, or land improvement.&#13;
High-value, labor-intensive crops like vegetables are more often infeasible,&#13;
especially since such regions are often sparsely populated, with most farms&#13;
far from urban markets. Multi-cropping and intensive weeding are less&#13;
attractive. As for land improvement, smallholders have fewer micro-irrigation&#13;
options in Maharashtra or Northern Nigeria than in coastal Andhra or the&#13;
Punjab, and neither "old" or "new" options on bad lands (neither contour&#13;
bunding nor watershed management) are proven.&#13;
Thus the advantages of smallness, via labor-intensity, in making "one&#13;
acre almost as good as three" are much less clear on bad lands. Curiously,&#13;
some excellent studies of progressive, modern Indian agriculture assert the&#13;
disappearance of the inverse relationship on good lands - yet prove exactly&#13;
the opposite (Roy, 1981; Bhalla and Chadha, 1982). 23/ Conversely, both&#13;
factor input ratios and, therefore, annual factor productivities seem, in the&#13;
more difficult semi-arid areas, to show a rather weak relationship to farm&#13;
area (Hill, 1982; Ryan and Rathore, 1978). The results of the Indian farm&#13;
management studies and of much work elsewhere (Berry and Cline, 1979; Kutcher&#13;
and Scandizzo, 1981) do show a generally inverse relationship, though&#13;
certainly "not everywhere and not at all times" (Chattopadhyay and Rudra,&#13;
1976, p. A-109). 24/&#13;
The debate is not over. It ma be that artificial stimuli to&#13;
tractorization, plus selective advantages to access and early adoption, will&#13;
prove persistent enough to permanently reverse the negative relationship&#13;
between farm acreage and annual per-acre farm product in "advanced" farming&#13;
areas of developing countries. At present, however, the evidence does not&#13;
point that way. Unfortuntely, landlords in "progressive" areas do find that&#13;
it pays to repossess land for direct cultivation -- but despite, not because&#13;
of, the acreage-productivity relatonship. In the great mass of "intermediate"&#13;
lands, such as those studied in the Indian Farm Management surveys, I suppect&#13;
that the inverse relationship persists. It is in "bad" lands, where natural&#13;
constraints leave few options for the would-be labor-intensifier, that the&#13;
relationship is perhaps dubious.&#13;
Therefore, the inverse relationship     which gives a boost to the one-&#13;
acre farmer's prospects of avoiding poverty -- by its very weakness in "bad"&#13;
lands, strengthens our "naive" explanation of why small farmers there receive&#13;
no more MEP, in a typical year, than landless laborers: not only is the land&#13;
not much good, but the advantages of smallness, family labor, and potentially&#13;
"cheap" labor-intensity are tenuous. However, this same weakness of the&#13;
inverse relationship in "bad" lands increases the difficulty of explaining the&#13;
other half of the problem: why both MEP and the indicence of poverty change&#13;
hardly at all in Visaria's Western Indian data as owned landholding rises from&#13;
about 0.5 acre to about 7.5 acres, or in the ICRISAT villages as operated&#13;
holding rises over a similar range.&#13;
3. Capital types, poverty relationships, land quality&#13;
The hypothesis here advanced, without evidence and for testing, is&#13;
that (in combination with resources and technology) relations among groups of&#13;
producers, not size-returns cross-sections, explain the "flat" poverty-&#13;
landholding relationships on bad lands. Such lands, in the present state of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
knowledge, do not yield enough to pay for tractorization (or most other forms&#13;
of labor-displacing investment). They thus tend to be worked with much labor,&#13;
relative to capital. A large part of income of bigger farmers is therefore&#13;
diverted to paying hired laborers, and the landless gain from that&#13;
diversion. However, these lands in most of Asia -- and a good deal of Africa&#13;
also -- rely, almost inevitably with today's range of feasible technologies,&#13;
on a large item of capital, viz. livestock. As mentioned, yields are usually&#13;
too low (and "spare" land too rocky or inferior, and labor too ample) to make&#13;
tractorization attractive; while the sun-baked hardpan at the end of the dry&#13;
season, plus the effect of extensive farming on labor costs (including travel)&#13;
relative to output value, militates against hoeing., This near-imposition of&#13;
animal draught 25/ -   while not bad for employment r does impose a heavy&#13;
burden of capital ownership; for draught animal requirements are largely&#13;
determined by the number of acres to be ploughed in the few critical weeks&#13;
before sowing, however low the yield, and however little land can be double-&#13;
cropped. Although in the early 1960s, and even a bit later, draught animals&#13;
in semi-arid areas of Western India were much likelier than land to be owned&#13;
by the poor, this may be ceasing to be so, especially with the reductions in&#13;
common grazing rights (Jodha, 1983). Increasingly, draught-power ownership is&#13;
becoming less feasible for farmers with smallish acreages, especially since&#13;
such farmers generally cannot make such economical use of their animals. 26/&#13;
Thus on "bad" land the one-acre farmer is little better off than the&#13;
landless laborer, because the latter is less readily displaced by capital; and&#13;
has until recently been little worse off than the middle farmer, because&#13;
livestock are more equally distributed than land. This may be eroded with&#13;
pressure on land, as larger holders are better placed to obtain draught&#13;
services at critical times, and to own and manage draught animals. But, at&#13;
least until recently, cattle draught has "flattened out" the incidence of&#13;
poverty, from the landless to the small-medium farmer. These circumstances do&#13;
not apply on progressively farmed "good" land.&#13;
(e) Ownership, control and tenancy&#13;
1. Tenancy less important on "bad" land&#13;
"Bad" land, as an asset, reduces the risk of poverty in a typical year&#13;
only when held in quite large amounts. This seems to apply, on the Indian&#13;
evidence, whether the land is owned or rented: Visaria (on poverty incidence&#13;
by areas owned) and ICRISAT (by area owned, plus rented-in, minus rented-out)&#13;
point the same way.&#13;
Also, on "bad" land, tInancy is much less important. In 1971-2,&#13;
across 17 Indian states, the r of irrigated proportions of cultivated land&#13;
upon rented-in proportions was 0.41. Also NSS showed rented-in proportions&#13;
far below the national average, 10.6 percent, in States with low land quality&#13;
- 4 percent in Gujarat, 5 percent in Rajasthan, 6 percent in Maharashtra,7&#13;
percent in Madhya Pradesh (Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, pp. 64-69). A&#13;
similar relationship appears to prevail in Egypt (Harik, 1979, pp. 44-5), and&#13;
a Thai comparison (of two villages only, but studied in detail and claimed to&#13;
be fairly typical: Phongpaichit, 1982, p. 71) also shows agricultural&#13;
backwardness linked to a low incidence of tenancy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
This "unimportance of tenancy" in bad lands might be challenged on the&#13;
grounds that quick surveys always underestimate tenancy, especially where it&#13;
is being concealed for fear of reform (Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, p. 67).&#13;
However, in areas of Rajasthan with very bad croplands, 3-4 month residential&#13;
surveys reported that 9 percent of operated area was leased in during 1961-2,&#13;
and 11 percent in 1978-9, in Naurangdeshar village (Brambhatt, 1974, p. vii);&#13;
in Harsawa in 1962 the proportion appears to have been even lower (anon.,&#13;
1970, p. 85); and in somewhat less extensively farmed areas four years of&#13;
observation (1975-6 to 1977-8) showed tenancy transactions affecting 12-15&#13;
percent of operated area in four ICRISAT villages - but, exceptionally, 35&#13;
percent in Kalman and 41 percent in Shirapur, "due to the delayed impact of a&#13;
prolonged drought of 1971-2 to 1973-4, during which the majority of farmers&#13;
lost their bullocks and other assets and failed to recoup them in the&#13;
following years" (Jodha, 1980, pp. 6-7).&#13;
On "good" lands, given the area of land worked, owner-operators appear&#13;
to be clearly at less risk of poverty than tenants in a typical year, and&#13;
tenants than landless laborers or peons (for irrigated areas, see Ledesma,&#13;
1982, pp. 47, 163 for the Philippines, and Hirashima, 1977, p. 66, for&#13;
Pakistan).&#13;
2. Does tenancy occur mainly for poverty-linked reasons?&#13;
(i) Redistribution by approaching optimal size?&#13;
One starts, like most economists, by seeing tenancy as a way to&#13;
transact in land so as to adjust a spectrum of widely different ownership&#13;
holding sizes towards a similar operational holding size. Such transactions&#13;
permit farming to approach nearer the optimum size, with each operational farm&#13;
near the bottom of the average-cost curve, at least for a given crop-mix and&#13;
environment. This would imply that large, and perhaps extremely small,&#13;
landowners rented out, and that small owners and non-owners rented in.&#13;
At first glance, such an option -- clearly good for efficiency 27/&#13;
because it cuts average cost -- must be good for the poor also, since it&#13;
enables them to rent in land. The poor are thereby, in effect, hiring out&#13;
their enterprise and voluntary labor-inputs as farmers. This chance to obtain&#13;
some control over the land asset appears to offer poor people better income&#13;
chances than the other option, of selling a fixed amount of pure labor-power&#13;
- but no enterprise - to farm land controlled by others. Anyway, this&#13;
option usually remains, since some big owners will choose to farm land&#13;
themselves and hire in workers, even if a market in tenancies exists.&#13;
(ii) Rising Ricardian rent, interlock, exploitation, regressiveness?&#13;
Yet a powerful populist tradition sees tenancy, in most conditions in&#13;
developing rural areas, as inefficient or "exploitative" or tending to worsen&#13;
poverty. On this view, the landowner, as a wealthy rentier, extracts a&#13;
surplus from poor tenants. These, it is argued, do not have effective&#13;
alternatives as laborers: man/land ratios are too high, the few large&#13;
commercial farms operated too capital-intensively, and the many tiny tenanted&#13;
farms driven by poverty to rely on high rates of "self-exploitation" without&#13;
hired labor. In some cases, small tenants may be able to rent only if they&#13;
also buy or sell goods from, borrow from, or work for the landlord; such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
"linked factor markets", it is claimed, further reduce the freedom of poor&#13;
tenants to compete and bargain.&#13;
Even the efficiency of tenancy vanishes in such cases; although the&#13;
individual crop-share tenant may, a la Cheung (1969), in general equilibrium&#13;
be no less efficient than the owner-occupier, the landlord-tenant equilibrium&#13;
could itself be Pareto-inefficient. Given the available land, labor and&#13;
enterprise, many landowners might prefer to leave much of their own labor and&#13;
enterprise idle, and to enjoy leisure or urban residence, while renting out&#13;
land to poor tenants on condition the latter also borrowed, bought, or sold&#13;
through them; such landowners might even find it then paid to divert their&#13;
savings from farm reinvestment to lending for consumption to their tenants&#13;
(Bhaduri, 1973). A static comparison of owned and rented land, e.g. to&#13;
establish the efficiency of sharecropping, could well show little or no&#13;
difference in factor inputs or in outputs per acre, for familiar Cheungian&#13;
reasons; yet the whole farming-tenurial system of the village might be&#13;
inefficient, compared with owner-occupied farming of the same land units. 28/&#13;
Compulsion upon tenants to tolerate factor-market interlocking or lose&#13;
their tenancies - while not necessary for the "inefficient equilibrium"&#13;
outcome -- makes it more likely. For example, in 100 wheat villages of Uttar&#13;
Pradesh, 8 percent of tenants were allowed to lease in from only one landlord;&#13;
23 percent had to render labor services to their landlords; and 55 percent&#13;
took interest-bearing loans from their landlords. Some such tenants are big,&#13;
and some landlords small; but on the whole it is not obvious that extra&#13;
poverty (due to semi-coercive surplus-extraction) and inefficiency, associated&#13;
with such proportions, are fairly unimportant, as the investigator believes&#13;
(Bardhan, 1982, tables 9.8-9.10, and pp. 9.8-9.11).&#13;
There are, in any case, sound Ricardian reasons for expecting the&#13;
share of rentiers in income to increase, as growing populations of potential&#13;
tenants (workers-cum-entrepreneurs) press for scarce land, pushing out the&#13;
extensive or intensive margins and raising the share of quasi-rent. The&#13;
probable damage done to the poor by tenancy systems would then increase over&#13;
time. If land were owner-farmed (individually or co-operatively), even with&#13;
no change in the distribution of operational holdings among farmers, the poor&#13;
would benefit.   For the rising quasi-rent would be retained by the farmers&#13;
themselves, instead of being increasingly paid to landlords (directly and,&#13;
perhaps, via interlock of land transactions with those in credit, labor, or&#13;
products).&#13;
(iii) Why standard approaches misinterpret tenancy-poverty linkages&#13;
Thus the "tenancy is good" view sees it as tending to make holding&#13;
size, and farm incomes, more equal among farming families -- and as raising&#13;
output too. In so doing, tenancy must reduce poverty, since both efficiency&#13;
and equity increase. On this view, tenancy renders operational holdings more&#13;
equal than ownership holdings. No more or less tendentious is the "tenancy is&#13;
bad" restatement of the latter proposition: that landlords, being few, big and&#13;
powerful, are locally well-placed to extract surpluses from many, poor, weak&#13;
tenants.&#13;
Both views leave out three considerations vital for assessing the&#13;
impact of tenancy on the incidence and severity of poverty. First, does&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
tenancy really move land from big ownership holdings into smallish operational&#13;
holdings? Second, can we judge the impact of tenancy on poverty by looking at&#13;
landowners and tenants alone -- or do many landless laborers fail to secure a&#13;
tenancy, yet find their poverty affected by tenure systems? Above all, when&#13;
we assess the relationship between tenancy and poverty, does it suffice to ask&#13;
if tenants are poorer than landowners (perhaps allowing for the condition of&#13;
pure laborers), or must we specify "the assumptions about the alternative"?&#13;
3. Tenancy and size-group transfers&#13;
On the first issue, K. N. Raj pointed out in the 1960s that, in some&#13;
Indian States, the area rented in was fairly close balance with the area&#13;
rented out in most size-groups of operational holding. States are of course&#13;
large and diverse; hence the above observation is still consistent with&#13;
"equalizing" trends, towards a common optimum size, induced by tenancy in most&#13;
localities within States. However, the ICRISAT villages in 1975-6 to 1978-9&#13;
certainly showed no uniform trend of this sort. First, of leased-out land,&#13;
large proportions, ranging from 30 percent to 66 percent in the six villages,&#13;
changed hands within the same size-group. Second, in three villages, the&#13;
proportions of land leased that passed from smaller to larger farms and from&#13;
larger to smaller farms were about equal, at 30 percent; in two others, much&#13;
more land was rented from small to big farms than from big to small. This is&#13;
inconsistent with both optimum-size, "tenancy good", and exploitation,&#13;
"tenancy bad", theories, as are similar district-level findings in Hooghly, W.&#13;
Bengal (Ray, 1978).&#13;
Table 3, however, does provide some basis for a contest between the&#13;
theories. Most Indian States in 1971-2 clearly show smaller operational&#13;
holdings more heavily dependent than bigger ones on leasing-in. 29/ This is&#13;
confirmed weakly in a big sample of W. Bengal villages for the same year&#13;
(Bardhan, 1982, tables 10-1, 10-2); more strongly from 10 villages of central&#13;
Gujarat in 1964-70, where farmers operating below 1 ha. accounted for 74&#13;
percent of land leased in, but only 12 percent of land leased out (B. Singh,&#13;
1981, pp. 165, 167; 12 percent of all operated land was leased out); and,&#13;
outside India, very strongly in two Thai villages, where the Gini coefficient&#13;
was drastically reduced by tenancy, from .60 for owned holdings to .35 for&#13;
operational holdings in Wer (N. E.) and from .65 to .27 in Mae Kue (N.&#13;
Thailand) (Phongpaichit, 1982) and in two villages in Laguna, Philippines&#13;
(Ledesma, 1982).&#13;
Table 3, unlike the micro-data, gives information only for leasing&#13;
in. Concealment of leasing-out (for fear of tenancy reform) is clearly very&#13;
great: for all of India the NSS in 1971-2 showed area leased in exceeding area&#13;
leased out by 20 to 1, viz. 14.Om. hectares - itself a substantial&#13;
understatement -- to 0.7m. hectaresl Yet the tiny landowners, who presumably&#13;
had less to fear from reform, stated much higher ratios, whereas the bigger&#13;
owners admitted some net leasing out. Thus 5.4 million households reported&#13;
zero land ownership but leasing-in of 1.75m. hectares. Among households&#13;
owning a little land (below 1 ha.), 9.7m. leased in, only 3.3m. leased-out -&#13;
possibly many did both -- and reported area leased in exceeded area leased out&#13;
by 6.6m. to 0.9m. hectares. Households owning over 10.14 ha. reported only&#13;
0.5m. ha. leased in, but 10.1m. leased out. In every one of the 17 States&#13;
sampled, owners reporting below 1 ha. showed ratios of leased-in to leased-out&#13;
area far above the ratios reported for all size-groups, and owners with above&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
10.14 ha. admitted leasing-out far above leasing-in except in Karnataka and&#13;
Maharashtra, with their relatively more feared tenancy legislation&#13;
(Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, Table 27).&#13;
Thus the "big picture" does still seem to be mainly one of big&#13;
landlords and small tenants (so that tenancy can be seen as alleviating&#13;
poverty by redistributing land rights, or as intensifying it by providing a&#13;
new mode of exploitation). There is a strong case against this view, but it&#13;
does not rest upon the counter-examples (most, anyway, from more advanced&#13;
Third World agricultures). In the Punjab between 1961-2 and 1971-2,&#13;
advantages of input access, and the newly increased profitability of farming&#13;
with modern inputs, did lead many bigger landlords to resume formerly tenanted&#13;
holdings for direct cultivation, and also led many micro-farmers to rent out&#13;
land and become pure laborers (Table 3; cf. Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, pp.&#13;
69-71). The experience of "unequalizing tenancy" in a third Thai village,&#13;
Baan Rai in central Thailand (Phongpaichit, 1982, pp. 76-7), may well reflect&#13;
similar "progress". However, it would be quite wrong to read any&#13;
inevitability into this. In 1962-72 in Haryana, despite similar progress to&#13;
the Punjab, micro-farmers continued to operate their land, and were not&#13;
"proletarianized" by the Green Revolution (S. Bhalla, 1983, p. 835).    Even on&#13;
an all-India basis, tenancy sharply reduced the all-India Gini coefficient of&#13;
landholdings, from .675 for ownership holdings to .583 for operational&#13;
holdings, in 1971-2 -- much more than the negligible reduction in 1953-4&#13;
(Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, p. 58).&#13;
On the whole, tenancy does move both control over land and&#13;
vulnerability to "exploitation" from richer to poorer rural households.&#13;
However, the main motive for tenancy does not seem to be the achievement of&#13;
optimum size, but "resource adjustment". Imperfections in the market for oxen&#13;
hire (though not significantly for hired labor) are frequently associated with&#13;
shifts of land from owners with few oxen, to operators with many (Jodha, 1980;&#13;
Bliss, 1976). It is also worth testing whether major tenancy transactions&#13;
take place to decrease fragmentation, so as to save time and land - or in&#13;
some cases to increase fragmentation, so as to reduce risk.&#13;
Nor are rentings-out, whatever their motives, simple non-&#13;
discriminatory transactions. It is statistically demonstrable in Thanjavur,&#13;
South India, and plausibly arguable for many other places, that landlords&#13;
"ration" tenancies, favoring some characteristics linked to poverty -&#13;
shortage of owned land, surplus of unskilled labor - but also some likely to&#13;
be inversely linked to it: ownership of draught animals, high incidence of&#13;
adult males, proven managerial capacity. Landlords' market power to select,&#13;
as tenants, applicants with some poverty-linked and some non-poverty-linked&#13;
features - and thus to destroy any connection, positive or negative, between&#13;
tenancy and poverty -- increases as irrigation raises the demand for tenanted&#13;
land (Bell and Sussangkarn, 1983), i.e. exactly where tenancy gets more&#13;
important, as we have seen above.&#13;
Thus, what weakens tenancy-poverty links is not that rather many&#13;
tenancy transactions are "counter-examples" - from small poor lessors to big&#13;
lessees. More transactions, and much more land, are in a large majority of&#13;
cases "flowing" the opposite way. There are too many exceptions, however, for&#13;
tenancy to be in most LDC rural situations a major redistributor of asset&#13;
control to the poor, or of rentier power to the rich. 30/ Tenancy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
transactions might have such effects (despite the counter-examples) if their&#13;
major intention - or effect -- were to achieve an economic size of&#13;
operational holding; but that seems not to be the case. Tenants and landlords&#13;
seek to adjust land to other resource endowments (for an account of models&#13;
conforming closely to the Bell-Sussangkarn account, see Binswanger and&#13;
Rosenzweig, 1981, esp. p. 32). In so doing, they tend to dissociate tenancy&#13;
from poverty or affluence relative to other forms of relationship to the land.&#13;
The absolute importance of tenancy to the poor, however, remains.&#13;
When the data for landlessness are examined (see (h) below), it will be seen&#13;
that in 1971-2, of the 7.5 mn. Indian rural households owning no land, 5.4 mn.&#13;
rented in and operated farmland -- an average of 0.8 acres per tenant;&#13;
whereas, among the further 41.5 mn. owning below 2.5 acres, the average&#13;
farmer, due to leasing in (net of leasing out), increased his operated area by&#13;
some 50 percent above the size of his owned area. Tenancy obviously matters&#13;
enormously for poor Indian households, even on NSS data suggesting that only&#13;
10 percent of all Indian farmland is tenanted. If a true national picture&#13;
were available, village studies suggest that a 15-20 percent figure would&#13;
emerge. And tenancy elsewhere in South Asia looms larger than in India&#13;
(though in most of Africa it is as yet less important).&#13;
Nevertheless, though small owners rely heavily on supplementary&#13;
tenancies, the associations between "tenancy" and poverty relative to owners,&#13;
or affluence relative to laborers, are fairly weak. This is partly because&#13;
few Third World rural households are "pure" members of any of the three&#13;
categories: many own a little land, rent in a little more, and do some farm&#13;
labor for other, bigger owners. The de-linking also happens partly because&#13;
tenancy arises more to adjust farmers' land to their available non-land input,&#13;
than in response to their income levels.&#13;
Tenancy may seem a more important component of poverty - or its&#13;
alleviation -- to those familiar with the more heavily tenanted areas of&#13;
India, or even more of South America. However, the question there is whether&#13;
the politically realistic alternatives to tenancy would provide the poor with&#13;
significantly greater or smaller shares in control over assets.&#13;
4. Tenancy, poverty and laborers&#13;
Little is known about the effects of tenancy upon employment, and thus&#13;
about whether local incidence of tenancy is a relevant "characteristic of&#13;
poverty" (or of its reduction) in individual households that rely on farm&#13;
labor for much of their income. It is well known that labor-intensity&#13;
decreases as operational farm size increases. Also, we have seen that tenancy&#13;
generally tends to reduce operational size below owned size 31/ (though we&#13;
have not yet asked whether, without tenancy, other forces would have similar&#13;
results). It might therefore seem a priori that tenancy, via reduced farm&#13;
size and hence increased labor-per-hectare, must help non-operating laborers.&#13;
However, while small farmers (and thus most tenants) have higher labor/land&#13;
ratios than large operators (who might farm more land in the absence of&#13;
tenancy), the ratio of hired labor to family labor is lower on the smaller&#13;
holdings - and may be further reduced by tenancy, given farm size, because&#13;
rental obligations reduce real income, and thus cause family income-earning&#13;
effort to be substituted for leisure-plus-hiring. So the effect of tenancy on&#13;
the demand for hired labor is indeterminate in theory 32/ as well as little-&#13;
explored in practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The rare occasions where a cross-section approach is possible confirm&#13;
that "pure" tenants, especially where (as usually) they operate relatively&#13;
small areas of land, hire less labor per acre than other farmers. In two&#13;
villages in Chengalpattu district, Tamilnadu, from 2 January to 14 July 1976,&#13;
the data in Table 4 confirm the small amounts of hiring-in done by "pure"&#13;
tenants.&#13;
The linkage of tenancy to labor hire is complicated by at least three&#13;
collinearities. Tenant farms tend to be smaller than owner-occupied farms,&#13;
and thus to use more labor per acre (Berry and Cline, 1979; Rudra and Sen,&#13;
1980).  Tenancy is associated with irrigation, and as such with higher labor-&#13;
intensity.&#13;
Above all, tenancy is a necessary condition for sharecropping. There&#13;
are both Marshallian and more complex arguments for expecting this to be&#13;
linked to low labor-intensity. Also, there are both Cheungian and other&#13;
arguments for expecting no such links (an excellent review is Binswanger and&#13;
Rosenzweig, 1981, pp. 21-32). However, there is little theory or factual&#13;
knowledge about relationships between sharecropping and the hired/family labor&#13;
ratio. In 1975-7, in two ICRISAT villages with sharecropping (Pant, 1981, p.&#13;
38), a rise of 1 percent, across households, around the average proportion of&#13;
land leased in -- quite high, about 35-40 percent, due to earlier exceptional&#13;
drought - was associated with a rise of 3.4 labor-hours used per hectare,&#13;
significant only at 10 percent; of 2.8 family labor-hours (5 percent); and a&#13;
fall of 0.6 hired-labor hours (n.s.). In this study, owned area per worker&#13;
and irrigated/operated land ratios were introduced as independent explanatory&#13;
variables. Further light on the independent effect of sharecropping is cast&#13;
by Bell (1977), who finds clear negative effect on per-acre hired labor input&#13;
if sharecropped land is compared with the operator's own land, but no effect&#13;
if "pure" sharecroppers and "pure" owner-operators are compared.&#13;
This spotlights yet another complication. Relatively few tenants are&#13;
not also small owners. Similarly, relatively few landlords completely give up&#13;
cultivation. The effect of sharecropping on labor-hire as between a farmer's&#13;
owned and operated land might differ, for several reasons, from its effect as&#13;
between a pure sharecropper and a pure owner-operator. Hence the effect of&#13;
tenancy on labor hire depends on whom the landowner choses as tenants. The&#13;
tendency towards these personalized choices appears to increase (as&#13;
"rationing":  Bell and Sussangkarn, 1983) with irrigation and other factors&#13;
raising the effective demand for land. In many places, there are few people&#13;
with no rights in land, and the effects of tenancy on landless labor are felt&#13;
- and to some degree controlled -- by micro-farmers, in deficit, who are&#13;
tenants or landlords as well as laborers on the land of others. However, in&#13;
areas such as Bangladesh, a rising proportion of very poor rural people&#13;
neither owns nor operates any land. There, tenancy as a "characteristic of&#13;
poverty" depends more urgently upon knock-on effects upon the landless, via&#13;
the volume and wage of employment offered to them. About such effects we know&#13;
shockingly little. More generally, plenty of empirical work suggests that&#13;
owner-occupiers within a village are neither much more nor much less efficient&#13;
than sharecroppers, and seldom much less likely to be poor; but we know almost&#13;
nothing about whether a sharecropping-dominated (village) system is likely to&#13;
make more or less efficient, or poverty-reducing, uses of and channels for&#13;
labor, lending, and land than an owner-occupier system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(f) Poverty, land reform, tenancy reform: assumptions about alternatives&#13;
1. The issues&#13;
The tenancy problem reveals two ways in which our attempt at a non-&#13;
causal, comparative approach to poor people's characteristics -- defensible&#13;
for topics such as demography or nutrition - falls short when we turn to the&#13;
role of assets. It is useful to know that the poor or ultra-poor have bigger&#13;
families than the non-poor, yet are found in job and status groups that on&#13;
average have smaller families. It is useful to know that the ultra-poor, but&#13;
not the moderately-poor, are exceptions from Engel's Law and its derivatives,&#13;
and reveal preference for improved nutrition over other uses of extra income&#13;
(Lipton, 1983, 1983b). But it is not so useful to know whether tenants are on&#13;
average poorer than landless or landowning households of the same demographic&#13;
composition and farming similar amounts and qualities of land.&#13;
This is because -- to some extent irrespective of causal sequences --&#13;
there are promising approaches to the de-linking of poverty from large family&#13;
size, or of ultra-poverty from perceived need to maintain food/outlay ratios&#13;
as income rises. But such policy options make less sense in the case of&#13;
assets, like land, in restricted supply. Land ownership and tenancy do&#13;
drastically affect the characteristics of the poor, but not primarily through&#13;
opening up gaps between owners, tenants, and laborers who are neither.&#13;
Control over land structures the whole rural economy, and with it the&#13;
incidence, severity, and nature of poverty among tenants, owners and laborers&#13;
(and the all-pervasive mixed categories) alike. Hence the policy options that&#13;
might reduce poverty, in respect of the topic "assets", are not - as they&#13;
are, to a considerable extent, in respect of the topics "demography" and&#13;
"nutrition", and even to some extent "labor" (Lipton, 1983a) -- mainly&#13;
decisions to shift policy benefits towards, or incentives affecting individual&#13;
decisions among, persons or households with particular characteristics&#13;
mediated by that topic. For example, policy benefits can, in principle, be&#13;
usefully shifted towards the poor by being concentrated on families that are&#13;
big; or that suffer low, illness-induced age-specific participation rates; or&#13;
that suffer chronic, hunger-induced lassitude. Or such groups can be helped&#13;
to take decisions that improve their chances to escape from poverty. But&#13;
policy on poverty and land (or other scarce physical assets) has more to do&#13;
with creating, or encouraging markets to create, structures of asset control&#13;
that reduce poverty incidence by changing the relationships of major groups of&#13;
people to the asset in question.&#13;
There are three major, linked analytical problems in respect of such&#13;
land policy. First, equity concerns have focused on redistributing ownership&#13;
holdings of land -- or on changing the terms of tenancies - whereas&#13;
efficiency concerns have focused on redistributing operational holdings.&#13;
Second, analysts have constantly used evidence that group X is much more&#13;
exposed to poverty than group Y to condemn a particular system of land&#13;
ownership or tenancy, instead of comparing that system with a feasible&#13;
alternative in respect of the incidence of poverty in groups X, Y, and the&#13;
rest of rural and urban society taken together. Third, even when such&#13;
comparisons are done, they frequently "compare model with muddle", i.e. they&#13;
set current conditions, with imperfect markets and knowledge and local&#13;
monopoly power, against idealized pictures of post-reform conditions (and&#13;
States), instead of examining the alternative scenarios for poverty implicit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
in alternative processes (no change, reform A, reform B, etc.), including the&#13;
impact of avoidance, evasion and subversion of each policy alternative. 33/&#13;
2. Ownership or operation?&#13;
The emphasis of land reformers on the redistribution of ownership&#13;
holdings is easy to understand. If land per household is the main determinant&#13;
of assets per person, and if assets-per-person are the main determinant of&#13;
freedom from poverty, than owned land is the relevant variable, whether equal&#13;
or unequal. If land ownership is fairly equal, it makes no sense to prevent&#13;
households from engaging in tenancy transactions, which principally serve to&#13;
adjust operated land to other resources (Pant, 1981; Jodha, 1980). If land&#13;
ownership is unequal, then again it makes little sense to legislate against&#13;
tenancy, because poverty and inequality can be quite dramatically reduced by&#13;
it - as in three villages (in very different circumstances) in Thailand&#13;
(Phongpaichit, pp. 70, 72).&#13;
Anti-poverty policy has often sought to avoid the difficult tasks of&#13;
land ownership reform, while recognizing the case for tenancy -- and hence to&#13;
institute legal controls over the terms of tenancy: over share-rentals, rules&#13;
for termination of leases, etc. However, in the great majority of cases, such&#13;
controls cannot be implemented if land ownership remains very unequal, and if&#13;
the demand for rented land, relative to the supply, generates market-clearing&#13;
prices significantly higher than the effective prices implied by official&#13;
controls (Herring, 1983, ch.2, esp. pp. 42-44). Moreover, the poor tenant&#13;
will usually gain from tenancy reforms, even if (as rarely) they are&#13;
effective, only if he has access to other means of production, notably water-&#13;
control (and loanable funds), that typically in developing rural areas&#13;
accompany land ownership (ibid., pp. 28, 33, 40, 45).&#13;
Yet efficiency concerns are principally with the distribution of&#13;
operational holdings. When Marshall, in claiming that sharecropping had to be&#13;
highly inefficient because the land operator, committed to (say) a 50 percent&#13;
cropshare, would push in labor and other variable inputs only so long as their&#13;
marginal value-product exceeded double their marginal cost, he certainly&#13;
overstated the case: that is, he did not consider circumstances that might&#13;
render sharecropping efficient. These include reduction of supervision-costs&#13;
for landowners who sharecrop out instead of employing; reduction of search-&#13;
costs for those who choose to sharecrop rather than to work on land operated&#13;
by others; risk-sharing effects; the possible sharing of input costs; and&#13;
general-equilibrium models in which sharecropping maximizes output because&#13;
potential sharecroppers equate marginal net income from labor in tenancy and&#13;
in farm employment, while landowners equate marginal net income from land in&#13;
owner-operation (with employees) and in sharecropping. However, this last&#13;
(Cheungian) argument assumes away the very risks and supervision-costs that&#13;
underpin the other defenses of sharecropping. The uneasy feeling remains that&#13;
sharecropping does have some efficency disadvantages over owner-farming or&#13;
fixed rentals. 34/ The argument is summarized by Binswanger and Rosenzweig&#13;
(1981), whose review of empirical work uncovers "only very minor differences&#13;
in input and output intensities between sharecropped and owner-occupied farms&#13;
and/or plots". Unfortunately, these differences appear to be concentrated on&#13;
small farms in just those poorer regions of south Asia -- West Bengal, Bihar,&#13;
Orissa, Bangladesh (ibid., p. 37) - where sharecropping is most significant,&#13;
and its practitioners poorest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Given the technical options, poverty is the upshot of low input&#13;
intensity (and/or inefficient input use) multiplied by inequality. Equality&#13;
is impaired by gross maldistribution of owned land, which in much of Latin&#13;
America and some of South Asia is in itself a major cause of poverty.&#13;
Efficiency may be impaired by some tenurial arrangements, and is also almost&#13;
certainly reduced by extreme disparities in operational holding size, and&#13;
increased by redistribution towards small-to-medium operational holdings.&#13;
35/ In many African and South Asian environments, 80-100 percent of land is&#13;
effectively owner-operated, but where the proportion is much lower - and that&#13;
includes some of the deltaic regions where lands are richest and the poor&#13;
poorest - there is major policy confusion between reform of ownership&#13;
holdings (to alleviate poverty by greater equality) and reform of operational&#13;
holdings (to alleviate poverty through higher output).&#13;
3. Comparing groups vs. comparing options&#13;
As we have seen, there are very few studies comparing poverty among&#13;
households with different relationships to land. One of the better surveys,&#13;
for Kerala in 1966-7 (before the major 1969 reforms), suggests a crucial&#13;
distinction between the 22 percent of households who were tenants with so&#13;
little owned land that they had to rent house sites (of whom 56 percent&#13;
reported annual income below Rs.1000), and the 23 percent who were "other&#13;
tenants" (43 percent); there were also 41 percent who were owner-cultivators&#13;
(of whom 38 percent were below the 1000-rupee line), and 12 percent pure&#13;
laborers (71 percent) (Herring, 1983, p. 182). Household sizes are not given,&#13;
so this cannot be converted into a clear poverty indicator. But plainly it is&#13;
only some tenants who are at greater risk than owner-operators, while both&#13;
types of tenants (of average farm size) do much better than the landless. A&#13;
similar finding is reported from the Philippines (Ledesma, 1982, p. 148); in&#13;
Pakistan, however, the clear poverty ranking (worst for laborers, then&#13;
tenants, then owners) has more to do with size difference than with tenurial&#13;
status (Hirashima, 1977, p. 66). This sort of comparison, however, like the&#13;
more often feasible comparisons of poverty incidence by holding size, gives&#13;
limited guidance on the poverty incidences to expect from different types of&#13;
tenure systems. The group comparisons, that is, might tell us where to find&#13;
poor people within a given structure of man-land relations. They tell us&#13;
little about how different structures of relations affect the incidence of&#13;
poverty or the characteristics of the poor.&#13;
"Before and after" studies of particular land reforms, while&#13;
important, would probably not answer that question either. Too many other&#13;
things are happening, and the effects of the reform (and of the other things)&#13;
are almost impossible to disentangle from the effects of avoidance, evasion&#13;
and concealment.&#13;
What may be more helpful are comparative studies of the incidence and&#13;
severity of poverty, and the characteristics of the poor, in places with&#13;
radically different land distributions, as between size-classes of owned or&#13;
operational holdings and/or as between different systems of man-land&#13;
relations. Ideally, such places should be ecologically comparable areas of&#13;
the same country. A good context for such a study might be a country where a&#13;
parallel study of regional farm-management systems, concentrating on farm&#13;
types, already exists, such as Brazil (Kutcher and Scandizzo, 1981), or India&#13;
(Bhalla and Alagh, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4. Poverty and agrarian restructuring&#13;
Perhaps surprisingly, we know a little more about how the processes of&#13;
reforming land ownership and tenure affect the poor, than about the&#13;
comparative statics of systems of ownership and tenure in respect of poverty&#13;
incidence and severty. In China, an ingenious modelling approach, based on&#13;
production-costs and accumulation in one commune, suggested built-in&#13;
tendencies for the processes of collective accumulation and taxation to affect&#13;
production costs and disposable income per worker in an equalizing way, but&#13;
only in the long term -- twenty years rather than ten; a test from another&#13;
commune confirmed the prediction of short-term rises in team, brigade, and&#13;
total inequality (Griffin and Saith, 1981, ch. 6), albeit from a much lower&#13;
level than prevailed in the great majority of developing rural areas outside&#13;
China. The success of a variety of redistributive reforms (Taiwan, South&#13;
Korea, Cuba, Kerala) in reducing rural poverty is fairly clear. What is less&#13;
often discussed is the impact of the reform process, and of steps to avoid it.&#13;
Private actions to avoid the impact of tenancy reform tend to deepen&#13;
poverty, whereas private actions to avoid the impact of ceilings legislation&#13;
-- which is the first requirement of distributive reform of ownership holdings&#13;
-- tend to reduce poverty. The main defenses of landowners, who feel&#13;
threatened by controls over rents or by rights (e.g. of purchase) assigned to&#13;
tenants, are (a) to evict tenants and resume personal cultivation, (b) to&#13;
shorten the terms and reduce the security of tenancies, thereby reducing the&#13;
risk that a tenant will either feel safe enough to insist on, or be well-&#13;
established enough to secure, his legal rights under the controls. The power&#13;
of landlords in the political, and especially in the judicial, processes is&#13;
such that legal constraints against eviction seldom work - always assuming&#13;
that the ownership-based structure of rural power is unchanged (see the&#13;
discussions of Sri Lanka in Herring, 1983, chs. 2-3).&#13;
Tenancy reform can often also be avoided legally by inserting&#13;
intermediaries between landowner and cultivator. In the Philippines, this&#13;
process has been linked to a reduction in tenancy sizes and incomes, a fall in&#13;
the ratio of hired to family labor, and hence damage to the landless, the-&#13;
poorest of all (Ledesma, 1982, pp. 121-2, 203).&#13;
Unlike some land reform, all tenure reform, when even fully&#13;
implemented, excludes the landless. Both they and small owner-occupiers can&#13;
be damaged as credit is concentrated on the tenant beneficiaries of reform.&#13;
With some tenure reforms, the landless can further lose from co-operative&#13;
farms whose management displaces labor -- hired before the reform by medium-&#13;
sized farm -- with machinery (Alberts, 1981, p. 172, for evidence from&#13;
Peru). But it is avoidance, rather than implementation, of tenancy reform&#13;
that really threatens the poor.&#13;
On the other hand, avoidance of ceilings legislation usually helps the&#13;
poor. Such avoidance takes two forms. First, landowners surrender their&#13;
worst and most underfarmed lands to the reform authority. Second, landowners&#13;
divest themselves of land below the ceiling -- genuinely via sales, but also&#13;
via bad-faith transfers to relatives and clients - before divestment is&#13;
required. These processes, however, both tend to redistribute ownership&#13;
holdings towards poorer groups, as is well documented for India (Vyas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
1979). Poor relatives and clients, having been "given" land in bad faith,&#13;
often hang on grimly, and (as in West Bengal in 1968) may find themselves&#13;
suddenly supported by governments that seek to enforce the transfer&#13;
legislation. Land sales - necessarily to people owning well below the&#13;
ceiling acreage -- at best pass ownership to the poorest, and at worst move&#13;
land into smaller and hence more labor-intensive units. Even bad land,&#13;
transferred by large holders to satisfy ceilings laws, is available for&#13;
distribution.&#13;
We have, perhaps, excessive expectations of democratic and non-&#13;
revolutionary land reform.   Thus in Pakistan the resumption of "only 1.9m.&#13;
acres -- 3.9 percent of land .... one-fourth of the land [previously owned] in&#13;
holdings larger than 500 acres" in Pakistan under Ayub Khan, and the&#13;
subsequent "limited aggregate effect of [Bhutto's] ceiling provision" in&#13;
appropriating a further claimed 2.8m. acres and redistributing them to 9.2&#13;
percent of non-landowning tenants (Herring, 1983, pp. 98-9, 111-3), seem to me&#13;
quite substantial. The same could be said of the effect of land&#13;
redistribution under ceilings legislaton in several Indian states (at least&#13;
Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal), in Sri Lanka, in Egypt (Harik, 1979), and&#13;
in some Latin American countries (Morales Nieto, 1978, p. 156, for Colombia;&#13;
Alberts, 1981, pp. 136-41, for Peru).&#13;
Commentators who compare the poverty impact of changes in land&#13;
ownership structure with official targets are aghast at the evasion,&#13;
underfulfilment and slow progress - at the "mere" 4 million acres, for&#13;
example, acquired under ceilings legislation in India (Laxminarayan and Tyagi,&#13;
1982, p. 36). But if one compares the impact with reasonable expectations in&#13;
non-revolutionary situations, one is likely to be more favorably impressed&#13;
(for data, see Tai, 1974, pp. 533-40, for seven major national reforms in&#13;
1951-59; King, 1977, pp. 223, 316, for South Korea and Indonesia; and Griffin,&#13;
1976, p. 94, for Morocco). One should be impressed, perhaps, not only by the&#13;
fact that many rich farmers escape loss while many of the poorest rural people&#13;
do not gain -- and even this is false in some cases -- but by the large areas&#13;
of land transferred, gradually, towards poorer people. This is perhaps&#13;
especially surprising where urban-based governments are willing neither to see&#13;
rural-to-urban surplus transfers eroded by the rapid dispersal of large farms,&#13;
nor to make reforms more acceptable to powerful rural people by largely&#13;
compensating them, out of general (including urban) taxation, for lands&#13;
expropriated. Certainly the harsh arithmetic, in cases such as Sri Lanka,&#13;
means that politically feasible ceilings will not release enough land for all&#13;
the poor: if as many as possible are to achieve holdings just sufficient to&#13;
feed their families and escape poverty, then many deficit farmers can be made&#13;
up to a viable holding size, but most of the landless, including many of the&#13;
poorest, will be left out (ILO, 1971). However, when we look at the history&#13;
of development in Europe, we will be surprised - not at the failure of Asian&#13;
and Latin American land redistribution to eliminate rural poverty in the last&#13;
thirty years, nor at its failure to benefit many of the poorest - but at the&#13;
large amount of redistribution, cooperative and individual, that has happened&#13;
within these highly unequal structures of power.&#13;
(g) Landlessness, micro-farming and poverty: choices of measure&#13;
Many possible definitions of "landlessness", "near-landlessness"&#13;
(which we call "micro-farming"), and "land-orientated poverty" exist. But&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
what are the levels, trends, and interrelations of these three phenomena? The&#13;
following discussion will be mainly about Indian large-sample data (NSS) for&#13;
three reasons. First, these data yield the richest harvest of both insight&#13;
and confusion. Second, recent important papers clarify these data (I. Singh,&#13;
1982; Cain, 1983; Sanyal, 1984; Pal and Quizon, 1983). Third, they can&#13;
usefully be set against other relevant materials, national (ARIS, n.d.; Labor&#13;
Bureau, 1977) and local (the village studies of ICRISAT and AERC Vallabh&#13;
Vidyanagar). However, a very brief account of evidence from other countries&#13;
will follow.&#13;
We are concerned with lack of the land asset as a possible&#13;
characteristic of poor rural people, and/or of people living in poor rural&#13;
regions. What should be measured, to indicate "lack of land asset" likely to&#13;
correlate with poverty incidence or severity? We could choose to measure:&#13;
36/&#13;
1. Lack of household land operated or owned?&#13;
"Given the policy concerns" to reduce poverty, Cain (1983, p. 150)&#13;
argues that the best definition of landlessness is non-ownership, a view also&#13;
taken (though less insistently) by Sanyal, and on the whole rejected by I.&#13;
Singh (1982, pp. 4-6). There is a case for using "ownership". First, owners&#13;
presumably seek to maximize net benefit to themselves from their owned land,&#13;
and thus choose a poverty-minimizing mix of owner-operation and renting-out.&#13;
Second, tenancy -- especially cropsharing, with excess supply of tenants, and&#13;
with talk of tenancy reform to encourage landlords to insist on short and&#13;
insecure leases -- can verge, at the margin, on quasi-employee status.&#13;
But there is an equally persuasive case for using operational holdings&#13;
to measure the likely contribution of a household's land to its chances of&#13;
freedom from poverty. Owners whose land is entirely "rented out" on usufruct&#13;
mortgage have typically gone most of the way to landlessness - and the&#13;
tenants, even if legally owning nothing, to acquiring land. Moreover, the&#13;
agricultural tenant household that can market management and labor must&#13;
normally be at less risk of poverty, other things equal, than if it could&#13;
market labor only. Perhaps smallholding, owned or operated, on very "bad"&#13;
land does little to cut the risk of poverty, but elsewhere it matters; and the&#13;
tenant's ability to trade labor and management for usufruct, even if insecure&#13;
and limited, renders it inappropriate to assign him to the same category of&#13;
"landlessness" as the pure laborer. 37/&#13;
Of course, a rural non-operating landowner can be rich (e.g. as a&#13;
landlord). But so can a non-owning operator (as a big tenant), or even a non-&#13;
owning non-operator (e.g. as a merchant). The "zero-class syndrome in which&#13;
many analysts get trapped", therefore, applies not only to assuming that all&#13;
the non-operators are poor (Sanyal, 1984, pp. 7-8), but also to assuming that&#13;
all non-owners are poor! Perhaps the Penny-Singarimbun (1973) proposal -- to&#13;
measure, and correlate with poverty risk, "land owned and operated, plus half&#13;
land owned or operated but not both" - is worth exploring, though very&#13;
demanding on the data.&#13;
Meanwhile, we do not claim that all rural non-operators (or non-&#13;
owners) of land are at relatively high risk of poverty, let alone the "near-&#13;
landless" on either definition. Careful micro-studies in eight Third World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
environments suggest that about one-third of rural income, yet only one-&#13;
quarter of work, originates outside agriculture (Chuta and Liedholm, 1979; see&#13;
also Sec. (a) (2) above). So "non-ownership, non-operating" income is not&#13;
only substantial, but earned with less work (i.e. less poverty-linked?) than&#13;
most agricultural income!&#13;
However, this fact does not delink landlessness - owned or&#13;
operational -- from the risk of poverty. In most of Africa, including the&#13;
areas studied by Chuta and Liedholm, artisan households are also earning&#13;
income from agriculture. Even in South Asia, where caste specialization often&#13;
affects artisan households, the better-off artisan castes generally own&#13;
significant farmland too, as a whole series of AERC studies from Gujarat and&#13;
Rajastan shows (Choudhary, 1962, p. 27, also showing operational holding;&#13;
Shah, 1968, p. 111; M. Desai, 1966, pp. 18, 113; B. Desai, 1967, p. 104;&#13;
anon., 1970, p. 90). With growing shares of rural people almost everywhere --&#13;
and already large shares in Latin America and Asia - dependent mainly on&#13;
working for other farmers to live, and with agriculture still accounting for&#13;
the big majority of rural income and work-time, it makes sense to look for&#13;
landlessness, and perhaps especially operational landlessness, as a major&#13;
characteristic of the rural poor.&#13;
2. Lack of arable land or of any land?&#13;
Operational holdings refer to farmland; ownership holdings, to all&#13;
land, irrespective of farm worth or of use. Hence Cain (1983, pp. 150-1; our&#13;
italics) argues for a concept of "owned arable landlessness" in South Asia,&#13;
because most non-arable land is in "the homestead; there is no, or almost no,&#13;
house-rent market, so that "the only alternative to owning a houseplot is a&#13;
way of life close to vagrancy ... [onlyl ownership of arable land ... defines&#13;
one's position with respect to the means of production".&#13;
There are several problems with this proposal. (1) In many areas --&#13;
Kerala, much of Java, and especially Sri Lanka -- the closely-tended, highly-&#13;
fertilized house-plot, though small, is a major source of income, and often of&#13;
direct calories, to large sections of poor people with no arable land. 38/&#13;
(2) In Bangladesh and parts of West Bengal, fishponds are significant non-&#13;
arable, non-homestead uses of owned areas. (3) Major rental markets in&#13;
hutments, often tied to land rents, exist (for non-vagrants) in Kerala&#13;
(Herring, 1983, pp. 181-2) - and clearly elsewhere also, because the 10&#13;
percent of households who owned no land whatever in rural India in the 1972-3&#13;
NSS round (Sanyal, 1984, Table 2) must have lived somewhere. (4) Indeed,&#13;
these NSS data for households not owning even "house sites" could be related&#13;
to interregional variations in the incidence of extreme asset poverty;&#13;
admittedly, some such persons are teachers, officials, railway workers, etc.,&#13;
but these should be fairly evenly spread across the land. (5) Attempts to&#13;
deduct all, and only, owners of no more than their houses (house sites?&#13;
homesteads?) from NSS data of "landowners" (and to add them to the landless)&#13;
- or to reduce estimates of owned acres by assumed areas not arable --&#13;
involve heroic assumptions, especially for comparisons over time (or among&#13;
States), as Cain himself stresses (pp. 152-4 and fns. 14-15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
3. Landlessness, near-landlessness and land quality&#13;
Complete lack of land obviously conduces to poverty more than a&#13;
holding of average size, but need not be much, or at all, better than a tiny&#13;
holding. And a tiny holding of reliably irrigated land can be worth more than&#13;
several acres of rocky outcrop. To allow for this, efforts are made to assess&#13;
the numbers of "near-landless" (Esman, 1978; Singh, 1981). Unfortunately,&#13;
additions of landless and near-landless (whether land is owned or operational,&#13;
arable or total) are likely to be bad guides to poverty, even if data are&#13;
fully reliable and if non-farm incomes are negligible, for two reasons.&#13;
First, the ratios between landless, "near-landless", and not-quite-so-&#13;
near-landless vary -- affecting poverty incidence and severity. In 1961-2,&#13;
the NSS estimates of the proportions of rural households with zero, .01-.49,&#13;
and .5-.99 acre ownership holdings (including homesteads) were, respectively,&#13;
11.7 percent, 26.2 percent and 6.3 percent; by 1971-2 they were 9.6 percent,&#13;
27.8 percent and 7.4 percent respectively (Cain, 1983, p.155). Thus&#13;
"landless" fell from 26.4 percent of "landless and near-landless " to 21.4&#13;
percent. Simply adding up landless and near-landless would miss this source&#13;
of expected gains -- if the figures are right -- for poor people. Similar&#13;
problems arise for operational holdings.&#13;
Second, land quality is critical. An acre or two in many areas of&#13;
Rajasthan really is little better than nothing, as a hedge against poverty.&#13;
In many parts of the Punjab, half an acre is much better than nothing.&#13;
Landlessness must mean a zero holding anywhere. But "near-landlessness"&#13;
requires different definitions according to land quality.&#13;
Sanyal (1984) has tried to solve these two problems by constructing,&#13;
in effect, a Sen index of access to owned land. He defines the ownership&#13;
holding for each State as the area, h acres, likely to permit monthly&#13;
expenditure per person, MEP, at the poverty line -- given the average quality&#13;
of land in each State (this MEP in turn is defined, following Sengupta and&#13;
Joshi (1979), as that associated with a particular caloric norm). The NSS&#13;
borderline closest to h is then used to construct a Sen index 39/ of what&#13;
might be called "land ownership poverty" (LOP).&#13;
(h) Some results for India&#13;
1. NSS data for 1971-72&#13;
We shall revert to the questions of how far LOP incidence can be&#13;
expected to be related to poverty; here, we stress that several aspects of the&#13;
above procedure overstate LOP. 40/ There is, however, considerable interest&#13;
in the variations, over space and time, 41/ in the Sen indexes and other data&#13;
for India compiled by Sanyal, Laxminarayan and Tyagi, and others, and reported&#13;
in Table 5.&#13;
In the 1971-2 NSS round, one Indian rural household in four was&#13;
operating no farmland; one in ten owned none; and only one in fourteen neither&#13;
owned nor operated land. There is no obvious reason why these figures should&#13;
be grossly inaccurate. 42/ A number of comments should be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(i) Link to non-farm rural income: For eight States, we know the&#13;
proportions of rural households dependent mainly on non-farm income for 1972-3&#13;
(Sec. (a) (2)). As expected, Table 5 (together with the last column of Table&#13;
6) shows the States with higher diversification out of farming - Punjab,&#13;
Haryana, Tamilnadu -- with a substantially higher proportion of rural people&#13;
operating no farmland than do the more agriculture-dependent rural areas of&#13;
Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra, though Kerala is an exception to this&#13;
relationship. There is no relationship between a State's rural&#13;
diversification and the extent of non-ownership of land (of any sort).&#13;
(ii) Ownership and operation: States are a very coarse level of&#13;
disaggregation. However, even across States, a clear relationship exists&#13;
between farm operation and what one might call "ownership of farmable land":&#13;
land in amounts that, however tiny, are significantly above the 25-90 square&#13;
metres (0.006-0.022 acres) that the poorest 20-26 percent of rural households&#13;
typically have under the roof (Bhat, 1964, p. 224; anon., 1970, p. 137).&#13;
Thus a scatter diagram for the fifteen states listed in Table 5,&#13;
excluding Punjab/Haryana, shows a quite good regression of the proportion of&#13;
non-operators among rural households (y) on the proportion of non-owners (x)&#13;
(r2 = .283, significant at 6 percent). However, Punjab-Haryana is an outlier,&#13;
with far more non-operators than would be predicted from the numbers of non-&#13;
owners. This is plainly because of the exceptionally large number of "owners"&#13;
with tiny holdings, presumably often house-site only - 48.5 percent of owners&#13;
own below one acre (as against the all-India figure of 35.2 percent), and the&#13;
average area they own is a mere 0.07 acres, far less than in any other State.&#13;
43/ Conversely, in Assam and Kerala, which are significantly below the&#13;
regression line, rural households owning below one acre nevertheless average&#13;
quite significant owned areas; hence a given proportion of non-owners&#13;
translates into a rather small proportion of non-operators, because many small&#13;
owners nevertheless do have considerable amounts of "farmable" land, and&#13;
choose to operate it.&#13;
We have seen that non-owners and small owners are substantial net&#13;
leasers in. In 1971-2, of 41.5mn. rural householders in India with ownership&#13;
holdings below 2.5 acres -- averaging 0.7 acres each - 9.7mn. leased in (an&#13;
average of 1.71 acres), and 3.3mn. leased out (average only 0.72 acres). So&#13;
these small owners leased in, net, at least 14.2 mn. acres -- there may have&#13;
been some concealment (fn. 42). Thus net leasing in raised the operational&#13;
area of the average Indian farmer owning below 2.5 acres (whether or not&#13;
leasing in or out) by some 50 percent above his owned area (Laxminarayan and&#13;
Tyagi, 1982, Tables 9, 27). On top of this, of the 7.5mn. non-landowning&#13;
rural households (calculated from ibid., Table 9, and Sanyal, 1984, table 2),&#13;
5.4mn. leased in an average of 0.81 acres each, or 0.6 acres per non-&#13;
landowning family whether leasing or not (Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, Table&#13;
27). There is probably some concealed leasing in (though perhaps not very&#13;
much in these small farms); anyway, these figures underestimate the role of&#13;
tenancy, both in ameliorating the effects of landlessness on the poor and on&#13;
permitting those with control of local land markets to extract monopoly rent&#13;
from the poor.&#13;
In view of the considerable importance of leasing-in, what is striking&#13;
about the ownership-operation relationship in Table 5 is its closeness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(iii) Landless, near-landless, poor: An upper limit to the rural&#13;
numbers usefully definable as "landless or near-landless" is those who neither&#13;
own nor operate land, plus those who own holdings too small - whether owner-&#13;
farmed or leased out -- to contribute "substantially" (see below) to their&#13;
family income. This is an upper limit because many in the latter group farm&#13;
considerable amounts of leased-in land. (Moreover, because many in both&#13;
groups rely on income from artisanship, trade or government service, the&#13;
figure here proposed is even more of an upper limit to those in poverty&#13;
induced by landlessness or near-landlessness -- though not, of course, to&#13;
those in poverty for any reason.)&#13;
What is meant by "contribute substantially to their family income"?&#13;
It is here proposed that a household deriving - from the application to its&#13;
owned land of other owned inputs plus labor - at least one-third of its&#13;
requirements to stay above the poverty line, cannot be defined as "landless or&#13;
near-landless". I. Singh (1981, p. 14a) estimates the average household size,&#13;
among persons likely to be in these groups, at 4.69 in 1980. 44/ Thus the&#13;
number of rural households in a State, whose leading poverty characteristic in&#13;
respect of assets is being landless or near-landless, is at most the number&#13;
not owning or operating land, plus the number owning too little land to feed&#13;
(4.69/3) or 1.56 persons. Given the high incidence of small children (and the&#13;
low body weight of adults) in poor households, about 300 lbs. of cereals per&#13;
person -- i.e. (1.56x300) or 469 lbs. of cereals (or the traded equivalent in&#13;
other foods -- might about meet one-third of household annual food needs. It&#13;
can be reasonably assumed that, at the poverty line, the household spends 20&#13;
percent of income on non-food. Thus a household at risk of being poor because&#13;
"landless or near-landless" would either own and operate no land, or own land&#13;
insufficient to yield -- net of off-farm production costs -- a value&#13;
equivalent to about 469 (100/100-20), or about 585 lbs., of cereal, per&#13;
year. (If a household owns enough land to produce this, but chooses to rent&#13;
out instead of owner-operating, it would be strange to call it poor because&#13;
landless. 45/)&#13;
Costs (i.e. factor shares) are attributed, for major Indian regions&#13;
and quartile MEP-groups, in Quizon and Pal (1983, Tables 1-6). Accordingly,&#13;
in Table 6, we can estimate the proportion of farm output that a landowning&#13;
household in the poorest quartile must pay to non-members of the farm&#13;
household in order to obtain its 585 lbs. of cereals. It has no land costs,&#13;
and we assume it relies entirely on self-employed labor. 46/ We assume these&#13;
households must bear the costs of fertilizer and farm equipment, and --&#13;
assuming some ownership - only half the cost of bullocks, irrigation and&#13;
"other".  On these assumptions for the lowest-quartile MEP group, almost&#13;
exactly 25 percent of farm output is eaten up by off-farm costs in the semi-&#13;
arid tropical (SAT) regions, 15 percent in the Eastern rice region, 23 percent&#13;
in the in the coastal rice region, and 39 percent in the North-west wheat&#13;
region. 47/ The corresponding gross output requirements from owned land, in&#13;
cereal equivalent per year, to avoid near-landlessness are about 585&#13;
(100/[100-25]) or 780 lbs. in the SAT, 688 lbs. in the Eastern and 760 lbs. in&#13;
the coastal rice regions, and 959 lbs. in the NW wheat region.&#13;
How much land is needed to achieve this? Cereal yields for 1975-6 are&#13;
given by States in Laxminarayan and Tyagi (1982, p. 153), but these figures,&#13;
for cereals available to humans, exclude the substantial use made, by small&#13;
farmers in particular, of stalks and stubble as livestock feed. A modest 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
percent is therefore added to these yields, to allow for the value of these&#13;
items. 48/&#13;
As Table 6 shows, while absolute landlessness is rare in India, "near-&#13;
landlessness" may be a significant problem. But the inclusiveness of the&#13;
people who are not significant tenants definition must again be stressed.&#13;
Many of the households in Column 5 (and therefore Column 6) of Table 6 are&#13;
"adequate tenants", left with a crop-share at or above Column 1 levels after&#13;
paying rent; and many other Column 5-6 households are not mainly dependent on&#13;
agriculture, i.e., are in Column 7. To estimate the numbers of near-landless&#13;
people who are not significant tenants who depend mainly on farming for their&#13;
livelihood, a different approach is needed.&#13;
2. Rural Labor Enquiry evidence&#13;
In mid-1965 and mid-1975, the Indian Ministry of Labor enquired into&#13;
the numbers and conditions of rural persons and households whose "largest&#13;
source of income was wage-paid manual labor" in the previous farm year (1964-5&#13;
and 1974-5 respectively). A household that derived 35 percent of income from&#13;
this source, 34 percent from operated (owned or other) farmland, and 31&#13;
percent from non-manual employment, is classified as a rural labor&#13;
household. A rural labor household obtaining 51 percent of employee income&#13;
49/ from manual, wage-period farm labor was classified as "agricultural labor"&#13;
(Labor Bureau, 1978, pp. 4-7).&#13;
These criteria do not coincide with the NSS's, used elsewhere in this&#13;
paper. They look only at incomes from employment and own-account work,&#13;
leaving aside rentier incomes; and they look at operational holdings only,&#13;
irrespective of ownership, as a source of farm income which could be big&#13;
enough to prevent a household from being classifed as landless. Nevertheless,&#13;
there is good reason to believe that "rural laborers" correspond rather well&#13;
with those at risk of poverty through lack of adequate access to owned land.&#13;
The data are useful, not only to cast light on the NSS landlessness data, but&#13;
to introduce the question of trends.&#13;
From 1964-5 to 1974-5, rural households in India increased from 70.4&#13;
mn. to 82.1 mn.   The proportion whose main single income source was manual&#13;
employment rose very slightly, from 36.1 percent (i.e. 25.4 mn. households) to&#13;
36.9 percent (i.e. 30.3 mn.). 50/ Among these rural laborers, 43.5 percent&#13;
had cultivated farmland during 1964, and 47.5 percent during 1974-5. 40.9&#13;
percent cultivated below half an acre, 19.3 percent half an acre to one acre,&#13;
and 15.4 percent one to one-and-a half acres in 1974-5 (ibid., pp. 22-24).&#13;
There was no big rise in reliance on employee income; there was some&#13;
improvement in access to land by rural laborers - especially farm&#13;
laborers. 51/ Of the 40 percent of rural labor households with over an acre&#13;
of operated farmland, few can have been "poor because near-landless"; some&#13;
will have been tenants, but some (though fewer) of the other 60 percent will&#13;
have been renting out owned land. It is interesting to juxtapose the RLE&#13;
estimate, that only 17.5 percent of Indian rural households in 1974-5 were&#13;
labor households operating no land, with Sanyal's deduction (Table 5 above)&#13;
that 27.4 percent of Indian rural households in 1972-3 were non-operators (of&#13;
whom only a quarter were also non-owners). Clearly, about 10 percent of&#13;
Indian rural households operate no land, but do not rely on rural labor as a&#13;
main income source. Who are they? The obvious answer, "Artisans", has to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
confront two facts from the twenty-odd village surveys from Gujarat and&#13;
Rajasthan, mostly from the 1960s, that we have scanned. First, in most&#13;
villages, a clear majority of artisans operates land (Bhat, 1964, p. 35;&#13;
Saxena and Charan, 1973, p. 35; for owned land, compare N. Shah, 1968,&#13;
p. 111). Second, many of the groups of specialists in traditional services&#13;
(barbers, washers, carpenters, etc.) are as vulnerable to poverty as "landless&#13;
agricultural laborers".&#13;
Perhaps the NSS group of 27-28 percent of Indian rural households that&#13;
do not operate any land includes two quite different subsets. First come the&#13;
17-18 percent who are non-operating rural laborers, at great risk of poverty;&#13;
only where jobs are increasingly assigned by achievement is this likely to be&#13;
a temporary circumstance within the life-cycle (for village-study evidence,&#13;
see Lipton, 1983b); this group is augmented by perhaps 2-3 percent of landless&#13;
artisans. The other 7-8 percent of non-operating rural households are at the&#13;
other end of the income scale: perhaps owning large areas and living from&#13;
assorted types of rentier income, perhaps schoolteachers or officials.&#13;
3. Supporting micro-evidence&#13;
Cain (1981, pp. 442-9) convincingly compares evidence from one village&#13;
in Bangladesh (Char Gopalpur) and three in semi-arid India. In the latter, in&#13;
a variety of political and ecological circumstances and despite population&#13;
growth, he finds landlessness affecting a decreasing proportion of&#13;
households. The proportion of households currently owning no land was 12&#13;
percent in summer 1980, but 32 percent at inheritance (median date 1957), in&#13;
Aurepalle; 17 percent (22 percent) in Shirapur; 18 percent (41 percent) in&#13;
Kanzara; but in the Bangladesh village 29 percent (20 percent). Intra-owner&#13;
distribution had also improved in the Indian villages (though the gains were&#13;
mostly in deciles 3 to 6: the very poorest gained much less). Cain attributes&#13;
this largely to threats of land reform, but adds that distress sales in&#13;
Bangladesh - and lack of social order, permitting the rich illegally to take&#13;
land from the weak -- also create the contrast. The great variation in the&#13;
extent to which states have accepted responsibility to stabilize incomes in&#13;
bad years (enabling the micro-farmers to avoid forced sales of land) also must&#13;
mean that "in many parts of India, conditions [viz. changes in, or harm done&#13;
by, landlessness] are likely to be much closer to those described in Char&#13;
Gopalpur, Bangladesh, than in the three Indian villages" (ibid., p. 470). The&#13;
NSS and RLE data -- suggesting little change, but if anything some improvement&#13;
- are the net upshot of areas of improvement and areas of deterioration&#13;
within a vast country.&#13;
Nevertheless, much evidence suggests that growing "landlessness and&#13;
near-landlessness" is not the central problem of Indian's rural poor. A study&#13;
in two talukas of central Gujarat (Dantwala and Shah, 1971, esp. p. 87; Shah&#13;
and Shah, 1974, for confirmation for the longer 1929-65 period) clearly shows&#13;
a shift towards smaller holders, and away from tenancy. The fact that some of&#13;
this is due to demographic pressure need not mean that distribution has&#13;
worsened.&#13;
The high incidence of land operation among farm laborers, already&#13;
spotlit in the NSS, is confirmed by the micro-studies, but so is the small&#13;
(and over the long term dwindling) amount, even of bad land, involved per&#13;
family. In Matar Taluka, Gujarat the proportion of households dependent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
mainly on farm labor rose from 1.8 percent in 1929-30 (cultivators 93.7&#13;
percent) to 24.4 percent in 1965-6 (53.6 percent) (ibid., p. 248). Despite&#13;
the enlargement of the laborer group by cultivators -- who (although relying&#13;
increasingly on labor income, because of demographically-induced rises in&#13;
person/land ratios) must have raised average size of holding for the laborer&#13;
group as a whole - average size of holding among cultivating labor families&#13;
fell from 3.1 acres in 1929-30 to about 2 acres in 1965-6, and only 21.7&#13;
percent of the 244 agricultural labor families were "owner-cultivators" in&#13;
1965-6 (as against 12 out of 23 in 1929-30). Matters were made worse by the&#13;
rise of about 30 percent in average family size during the 36 years - to 4.4&#13;
for families relying mainly on agricultural labor income, 5.1 for cultivator&#13;
families with 0-5 acres, and 5.4 for the village as a whole (ibid., pp. 60,&#13;
146).&#13;
During a later period in Gujarat, however, a pair of surveys in Jambua&#13;
village in 1964-5 and 1975-6 (V. Patel, 1980) strongly confirms the State-&#13;
specific and nationwide findings of Vyas (1976, 1979): landlessness, whether&#13;
defined in ownership or operational terms, and with or without "near-&#13;
landlessness", has in recent years not been a growing component of rural&#13;
poverty. Land operating households in Jambua increased by 36.6 percent (and&#13;
total village population by 33.6 percent); "small farms", below 5 acres,&#13;
increased their share in the numbers of operated holdings from 49.6 percent to&#13;
60.1 percent (i.e. by 21.2 percent), but in land operated from 22.3 percent to&#13;
31.3 percent (i.e. by 40.7 percent); hence average operated size per small&#13;
farm fell by only 5 percent over the period -- as against a 10 percent fall in&#13;
the size of the average farm above 5 acres, despite the "relegation" of the&#13;
least-big of these latter farms from the big to the small group (ibid., p.&#13;
131).&#13;
The Jambua resurvey, incidentally, confirms one of the two major&#13;
hidden disadvantages of small farms as a hedge against poverty:&#13;
fragmentation. Not only are small farmers' fragments smaller than big&#13;
farmers' - a finding confirmed in many micro-studies, notably Bambal (1966,&#13;
p. 99) -- raising the "wasted" share of human and animal effort (in walks to,&#13;
from and among workplaces) and of land (in partitions); the ratio seems to be&#13;
getting more unfavorable to small farmers with demographic change (Patel,&#13;
1980, p. 123). The other hidden disadvantage of small-farm hedges against&#13;
poverty -- difficulty in managing bad years without asset depletion,&#13;
especially since bigger farmers' adjustments to bad years reduce demand for&#13;
hired labor, which damages employment prospects for deficit farmers - is also&#13;
well exemplified in micro-studies, this time in the ICRISAT villages (Walker&#13;
and Jodha, 1982, p. 9). Singh and Walker (1982, p. 25) find that "average&#13;
resource stability ... was not significantly different" among operational&#13;
farm-size groups (and that sharecropping helped to transfer risk to better-off&#13;
landowners: pp 23-4) -- but that is only half the battle, if smaller, poorer&#13;
farmers (1) must sacrifice expected income to richer people in order to "buy"&#13;
such insurance, and (2) remain (Walker and Jodha, 1982) bad at handling risk&#13;
without decumulating their few remaining assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
In rural India, at most 20 percent, probably closer to 15 percent, of&#13;
people both depend mainly on agriculture for income, and have no, or minimal,&#13;
access to land. By this, we mean that they are either non-owning, non-&#13;
operating farm laborers, or owners of land insufficient to produce even one-&#13;
third of caloric requirements. These proportions are increased only&#13;
marginally if we add rural people with "no, or minimal, access to land" who&#13;
are rural non-farm laborers. Where land is relatively good, these 15-20&#13;
percent probably overlap rather closely with India's rural ultra-poor. In&#13;
areas of bad or ill-watered land, the "landless and near-landless" are little&#13;
or no likelier to be poor or ultra-poor than persons owning up to 5-7 1/2acres.&#13;
A few words are needed about landless agricultural laborers in urban&#13;
India. Agricultural labor is the main occupation of 7 to 10 percent of the&#13;
urban workforce, with, with women and casual work more heavily represented&#13;
than in other urban activities. In 1972-3, almost 40 percent of female casual&#13;
laborers in urban Gujarat, and over 60 percent in urban Maharashtra, gave&#13;
their main income source as "agricultural labor" (male casuals respectively 22&#13;
percent and 33 percent: Visaria, 1980, p. 20).&#13;
The risk of urban poverty, and especially of ultra-poverty, increases&#13;
sharply with casual labor -- and with female participation, up to a ceiling&#13;
rate (Lipton, 1983a). While we do not know that these urban casual farm&#13;
laborers are landless, or almost so, it is highly probable - especially for&#13;
women. More research into poverty and landlessness among urban farmworkers&#13;
would be fruitful.&#13;
(i) Landlessness and near-landlessness: non-Indian evidence&#13;
I. J. Singh (1982, pp. 7, 9-12) has usefully summarized our limited&#13;
information for Bangladesh and Pakistan. In Bangladesh in 1978, about 30&#13;
percent of rural households owned no land. About 40 percent were "dependent&#13;
mainly on manual wage employment", and presumably around a quarter of these&#13;
owned some land.&#13;
The data do not permit reliable inferences about recent trends; 52/&#13;
but the data for the 1960s (Khan, 1977a, pp. 150, 155-7), when set against the&#13;
1978 information, suggest a sharp increase in the incidence of landlessness,&#13;
near-landlessness and rural labor-dependency. This is supported by village-&#13;
level surveys (Cain, 1981), as are the very high levels of near-landlessness&#13;
(Khan, Islam and Huq, 1981, p. 42). All this is in contrast to India, where&#13;
these incidences have been stagnating or in mild decline, with population-&#13;
growth and polarizing forces at least offset by the impact of land-reform&#13;
(however unsatisfactory) and its avoidance, and by growing productivity on&#13;
some of the tiny holdings of the near-landless.&#13;
The data on rural poverty in Bangladesh clearly indicate prolonged&#13;
increases, at least in severity (Sen, 1981; Khan, 1977a). These trends cannot&#13;
be directly proved to be due to the spread of landlessness and near-&#13;
landlessness, but it is highly probable. Off-farm employment is likely to&#13;
have been adversely affected both by the problems of the jute industry and by&#13;
the shift to much less labor-intensive methods of rice processing, especially&#13;
milling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Information for Pakistan is even scarcer. Singh (1981, p. 6) suggests&#13;
that agricultural non-operators of land - and landless farm-labor households&#13;
-- rose fom 9 percent to 20 percent of rural people in the 1960s, but adds&#13;
that "this reconstruction is very weak and involves many assumptions about the&#13;
data". At the 1972 Agricultural Census, only 12 percent of farm households&#13;
depended entirely on labor income; 34 percent were pure labor households,&#13;
owning no land (Herring, 1983, p. 10). 53/&#13;
Between 1963 and 1973, distribution of land in Indonesia, and within&#13;
it in Java, does not appear to have become more unequal (Rosenberg and&#13;
Rosenberg, 1980, pp. 28, 34). However, population growth, upon a limited land&#13;
surface, increased the proportion of persons forced by operational "near-&#13;
landlessness" to live mainly from farm labor, and/or forced by low ownership&#13;
levels to enter into less and less favorable tenancy arrangements (ibid., pp&#13;
34, 49; Penny and Singarimbun, 1973). Tenancy in Java, through on ever&#13;
harsher terms, did equalize access to land; of 164 families in one village in&#13;
1970, 37 percent owned no land (and a further 30 percent owned below 0.25&#13;
acres), but only 6 percent (28 percent) controlled corresponding areas (Penny&#13;
and Singarimbun, 1973, pp. 10, 13). Micro-studies by Hart (1980) and others&#13;
(see references in Lluch and Mazumdar, 1981) also suggest that one-third of&#13;
Java's rural households were landless or near-landless in the mid-1970s,&#13;
rather than "almost half" (Palmer, 1977, p.211). Both before and during&#13;
Indonesia's "green revolution", the terms of access to these very fertile&#13;
Javanese lands may well have been moving in favor of owners, but actual lack&#13;
of access, while quite significant, does not appear to have increased.&#13;
In the Philippines, agrarian reform appears to have increased the&#13;
income gap between (often poor) tenants and (often ultra-poor) landless&#13;
laborers, but to have narrowed the gap between tenants and owners (Rosenberg&#13;
and Rosenberg, 1980, pp. 82-93). Some village-level data confirm this&#13;
(Ledesma, 1982, pp. 121-2, 203), and also show sharp rises in the proportions&#13;
of pure landless-labor households, with neither owned nor operated land&#13;
(Rosenberg and Rosenberg, 1980, p. 108).&#13;
Some Latin American evidence indicates similar perverse effects from&#13;
tenancy reforms, with evictions (to evade reform) increasing the number of&#13;
landless who supply hired labor, while the enlarged commercial farms&#13;
(replacing former tenant holdings) demand less labor-per-hectare (Alberts,&#13;
1981, pp. 170-178, for Peru; Nieto, 1978, for Colombia).&#13;
African circumstances are of course rather different. For example,&#13;
Nigerian micro-evidence suggests a clear downtrend in the land share of the 40&#13;
percent of rural people with the smallest holdings -- but if, as Matlon's data&#13;
suggest, farm size (at least in Northern Nigeria) is not significantly related&#13;
to income expectations because it deters off-farm work, then the "smallest" 40&#13;
percent need not have been poorer than the others to begin with, and may have&#13;
gained more in off-farm income-share than they lost in landed income-share&#13;
(Collier, 1983, pp. 203-6). Land scarcity - and inequality - in Africa is&#13;
much more than is usually believed (Ghai and Radhwan, 1983, p. 11), but this&#13;
tells us little about poverty, because poverty is not nearly as firmly linked&#13;
to landholding status as in most rural areas outside Africa. Egypt, with its&#13;
dense river-basin farming, is more like Asia in these respects than like most&#13;
of Africa, but Egyptian land-use reform appears clearly to have increased both&#13;
access to land, and demand for labor from those who remained landless (Harik,&#13;
1979, pp. 36-9, 80-4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Plainly, the recent evidence about levels and trends in landlessness&#13;
and near-landlessness, and their relation to rural poverty, outside India is&#13;
fairly unsatisfactory. (Some of the older information, such as that in the&#13;
excellent CEPAL studies summarized in Stavenhagen (1970), is now so out of&#13;
date as to be seriously misleading.) But some negatives can be quite strongly&#13;
affirmed. Landlessness and tenancy are not in general increasing. Land&#13;
distribution, and the terms of tenancy, are not in general worsening.&#13;
Ceilings-plus-redistribution is not an absurd failure. Land access inequality&#13;
is not as important a direct correlate of poverty as this author, anyway, had&#13;
believed -- especially if we allow for the very strong relationship between&#13;
farm size and household size (Singh, Asokan and Walker, 1982, p. 24; Bambal,&#13;
1966, p. 59; Bhat, 1964, p. 67; Chaudhary and Bapat, 1975, p. 310, on&#13;
fallowing; Norman, 1976, pp. 14-17, 31-38, for Nigeria).&#13;
Does all this mean that land inequality doesn't matter? Exactly the&#13;
opposite. Just as with high-risk poverty-induced undernutrition, so with land&#13;
hunger as a cause of dangerous ultra-poverty: if there is not so far to go as&#13;
had been imagined, the journey becomes more promising, and the case for delay&#13;
looks more like a feeble excuse. Also, the evidence on labor (Lipton, 1983a)&#13;
suggests not only that the ultra-poor do even worse than had been feared in&#13;
respect of wages and participation and unemployment (fluctuations as well as&#13;
levels in each case), but also that they do worst when assetless; lack of any&#13;
fall-back weakens their bargaining position and compels them to incur massive&#13;
search costs. Land redistributions do achieve something -- and may not need&#13;
to achieve their full target, may indeed succeed despite much evasion, if the&#13;
chief aim is to provide a reserve position for the ultra-poor.&#13;

FOOTNOTES&#13;
1. Only in India, among LDCs, are closely comparable village-level and&#13;
regional-sample data available on such a basis. Inequality within a&#13;
small rural area is much more in most of India, Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan than in most of Africa, but less than in most of Latin&#13;
America.&#13;
2. The better-off persons are generally bigger, and less "selected" for&#13;
high metabolic efficiency. These characteristics raise, respec-&#13;
tively, their kgs. per person and their caloric requirements per kg.,&#13;
as compared to poor persons. Also the child/adult ratio is higher&#13;
among the poor, again lowering their relative requirements per&#13;
person. See Lipton (1983).&#13;
3. In the higher deciles, a substantially larger proportion of household&#13;
members are adults, able to work; and unemployment rates are lower.&#13;
Work per household member, despite much lower rates of female&#13;
participation, is probably not much less in top than in bottom&#13;
deciles. Is the bottom decile's work twenty times nastier, per hour?&#13;
4. The fact that this analysis switches between ownership and operation&#13;
of land and other assets, when analyzing the relationship of asset-&#13;
holding to poverty, is inevitable, given the data. The bitty&#13;
evidence suggests that the damage done by such sloppiness is&#13;
surprisingly small. For a constructive, but very data-thirsty,&#13;
suggestion, see Penny and Singarimbun, 1973.&#13;
5. (a) Normally, it is the second part of the "calories-labor-income"&#13;
sequence that can be made more efficient (multiplied) by appropriate&#13;
physical or human assets. They might conceivably also multiply the&#13;
first conversion, by raising metabolic efficiency. (b) The&#13;
distinction between "multipliers" and "adders" is, in regard to&#13;
returns, precisely analogous to the variable-fixed distinction in&#13;
regard to costs.&#13;
6. A poor household would presumably try to structure these assets, not&#13;
only for high yield, but also to reduce the covariance of their yield&#13;
with labor income. Less poor people would presumably be less&#13;
concerned with the latter, risk-reducing, objective, partly because&#13;
their risk aversion is less, partly because labor income is a smaller&#13;
part of their total income.&#13;
7. This is not so, however, where extra land is relatively plentiful (at&#13;
little greater cost per unit of output) than intra-marginal, and/or&#13;
draught-power is especially scarce. In Botswana, draught animals are&#13;
much more unequally distributed than land: see Watanabe and Mueller,&#13;
1982, Table 3.&#13;
8. A powerful statement is Chenery et al. (1975). There is evidence&#13;
that countries with rapid growth tend to show above-average records&#13;
in alleviating poverty, but also that, without conscious policies for&#13;
"redistribution with growth", early development probably increases&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
economic inequality, down a "Kuznets curve". See World Bank (1980),&#13;
pp. 35-6, 40.&#13;
9. Notably because land is worked more labor-intensively in smaller&#13;
holdings (partly because labor search costs, for employer and&#13;
employee, are avoided by family labor). See Berry and Cline, 1979.&#13;
10. See above, fn. 4.&#13;
11. These need not imply collective or cooperative land management or&#13;
use.&#13;
12. These are Siamese twins. As population grows, the dilemma of the&#13;
commons intensifies. This "tragedy" (akin to Prisoner's Dilemma or&#13;
the isolation paradox) arises because each user of a common facility,&#13;
e.g. a grazing right, faces incentives leading him to increase use,&#13;
e.g. private herd size, until marginal private revenue equals&#13;
marginal private cost. But, with a common facility and uncontrolled&#13;
access, marginal private cost is zero. Hence the totality of use&#13;
(e.g. of private herds grazing common land) is much larger than the&#13;
socially optimum level, which would equate marginal revenue and&#13;
marginal social cost -- the latter being well above zero. Since&#13;
marginal social cost increases with the number of grazing beasts,&#13;
more herders (population growth) normally increase the excess of&#13;
actual, privately optimizing, use over the social optimum, and deepen&#13;
the "tragedy".&#13;
13. This Program, since 1973 indirectly supported by two successive IDA&#13;
loans (the first and second Livestock Development Programs), involves&#13;
public fencing and borehole provision on ranches of several hundred&#13;
acres. These facilities are rented to private ranchers. The aim is&#13;
to reduce their overgrazing on the remaining common lands; the&#13;
previously common lands, now enclosed for ranching, were supposed to&#13;
have been ungrazed communally beforehand. Both aim and supposition&#13;
are open to question (Hitchcock, 1979; Lipton, 1979).&#13;
14. This is particularly likely if (a) growth has been unequal,&#13;
concentrating on persons with marginal propensities to consume animal&#13;
products well above, and cereals well below, the national average, or&#13;
(b) exporters have privileged access (e.g. under the Lome "beef&#13;
protocol" as Associates of the European Community) for some animal&#13;
products.&#13;
15. In the sense that, while it is technically feasible to lift or ease&#13;
the apparent "constraints", the cost of doing so - unless prices or&#13;
technology become much more favorable - is prohibitive.&#13;
16. Details of the construction of this line are given in Visaria&#13;
(1978). It certainly falls far above the level of nutrition-linked&#13;
ultra-poverty, as defined in Lipton (1983). However, this hardly&#13;
matters in this context, especially as the probability of being in&#13;
the bottom two MEP deciles - which are certainly ultra-poor - is&#13;
also, as Visaria shows, unaffected in both States by landholding up&#13;
to the levels stated here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
17.  (a) The increases in average family size continued to accompany&#13;
increased holding size well after the 7.5-acre level, but the&#13;
incidence of poverty then fell off sharply. (b) Completely non-&#13;
landowning households who derived most of their income from&#13;
cultivating land (as pure tenants) were too small a sample -- 2 in&#13;
rural Maharashtra, 15 in rural Gujarat - so the ".1-1 acre owner-&#13;
cultivators" are used.&#13;
18.  For example, in rural Gujarat, 20.1 percent of landless households&#13;
were in the bottom two MEP deciles (and 17.8 percent in the top two);&#13;
25.3 percent (14.5%) of households owning 0.01-1 acres; 25.1 percent&#13;
(15.3%) with 1-2.5 acres; 26.0 percent (16.1%) with 2.5-5 acres; and&#13;
22.7 percent (18.5%) with 5-7.5 acres. Only for larger holdings did&#13;
the position shift notably: 13.8 percent (26.8%) at 7.5-10 acres;&#13;
13.1 percent (24.0%) with 10-20 acres; and 5.2 percent in the two&#13;
poorest deciles (but 35.7% in the two richest) for households owning&#13;
above 20 acres (Visaria, 1978, p. 49).&#13;
19.  The three poverty lines use MEP of Rs. 42 (1972-3), corresponding to&#13;
expected calorie intake of 2435/CU; Rs. 38; and Rs. 32 (corresponding&#13;
to the lower calorie norms advocated by Sukhatme, 1982). The linear&#13;
regressions of percentages in poverty (P) on NSS year(t) (1963-4 = 0,&#13;
1964-5 = 1 ... 1973-4 = 11), are: for an Rs. 42 poverty line, P' =&#13;
43.83-1.21t (r2 = 0.55); for Rs. 38, P2 = 34.78-1.04t (r2 = .53); and&#13;
for Rs. 32, P3 = 22.23 - 0.91t (r = 0.58). All beta coefficients&#13;
and constants are significant at 2 percent or better.&#13;
20.  By definition, these households' main income source is agricultural&#13;
labor, so that land must be a smaller source.&#13;
21.  Ledesma  (1982, p. 22) divides household members into "economically&#13;
active, i.e. aged 13-65" and "other". We arbitrarily weight these at&#13;
1 and 0.5 consumer-units respectively. The differences among the&#13;
four groups in monthly expenditure per person are smaller -- i.e. the&#13;
child/adult ratio is presumably larger in landed households - but&#13;
the direction is the same.&#13;
22.  Later sections consider terms of access to land (e.g. tenancy),&#13;
levels and trends in poor people's access and terms, and the position&#13;
of particular groups (women, low castes, etc.) regarding the land-&#13;
poverty relationship.&#13;
23.  A large majority of Roy's districts reveal, where a significant&#13;
result is obtained, persistently inverse relationships, including the&#13;
progressive "leader", Ludhiana. Yet - greatly influenced by one&#13;
district, Amritsar -- Roy implies that the inverse relationship has&#13;
vanished. Bhalla and Chadha (1982, p. 881), for a random stratified&#13;
sample of 1,663 farm households throughout Punjab State in 1974-5,&#13;
show that gross output per acre rises by 0.46 percent (significant at&#13;
0.01) for each 10 percent fall in farm area. The response of net&#13;
output would be more, since large farmers tend to use more purchased&#13;
inputs per acre than small ones. Yet the authors conclude that "in&#13;
the central Punjab plains, the traditional inverse relationship&#13;
between farm size and productivity stands reversed" (Bhalla and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Chadha, 1982a, p. 876); no separate data or equations for sub-regions&#13;
are given.&#13;
24. These authors also find an inverse relationship in a large majority&#13;
of cases where there is statistical significance.&#13;
25. Readily available land too bad for economic crop farming, but&#13;
suitable for grazing -- often rocky below a few inches of soil --&#13;
decreases the private cost of holding draught, as do the relatively&#13;
ample crop residues of traditional long-strawed millets and&#13;
sorghum. Grazing rights are less and less often often communal,&#13;
however; maintenance costs are raised by the need to supplement feed&#13;
with cattle-cake, etc., before the heavy work of breaking the&#13;
hardpan; and capital costs of draught beasts are substantial. Hence&#13;
draught livestock in semi-arid areas, while attractive to own&#13;
compared with other potential draught sources, are very unequally&#13;
distributed among operational holdings.&#13;
26. The fragmentation of small holdings into very small plots means - in&#13;
conjunction with the extremely imperfect market in hired services of&#13;
draught animals -- that small farm operations lose out heavily. That&#13;
is because -- in semi-arid areas especially, with their extensive&#13;
farming, and often substantial rocky areas between farmlands - large&#13;
parts of draught-animal energy are used by small farmers in movement&#13;
to, from and among small plots, rather than in ploughing. This is&#13;
not a true (technological) economy of scale, since either&#13;
consolidation of plots (without changing the distribution of land&#13;
among farms) or a less imperfect hire market would remove this&#13;
drawback of smallness even without technical change.&#13;
27. We assume either share-rent with the Cheungian general-equilibrium&#13;
argument sufficiently valid that remaining Marshallian input-&#13;
reduction inefficiencies are outweighed by the efficiency effects of&#13;
the move towards optimum size, or fixed rent.&#13;
28. This is analogous to Rudra's observation that strong price&#13;
correlation between two markets need not prove that both are -&#13;
efficiently integrated; both might be subject to similarly structured&#13;
monopoly power or other distortions.&#13;
29.  There is no convincing reason why concealment of leasing in &#13;
presumably, for fear that landlords would retaliate if tenants&#13;
revealed it to survey officials - should distort the ratios between&#13;
entries for any one State in Table 3. If anything, such concealment&#13;
and fear would be greater for smaller tenants, so that the extent to&#13;
which tenancy in was moving land to smaller operations would be&#13;
greater than suggested by Table 3.&#13;
30. That is especially the case since "small to large" leases are of two&#13;
types: mortgages, in which the small owner is often in process of&#13;
losing land (and almost always obtaining bad terms for its rental) on&#13;
account of an earlier loan; and true rentals, in which the small&#13;
owner chooses to adjust operated land downwards and use labor&#13;
elsewhere. Prevalence of the former type would normally be linked to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
poverty, of the latter to escape from poverty. The two types were&#13;
hardly ever separated in survey data (an exception is Chaudhary and&#13;
Bapat, 1975, pp. 308-11).&#13;
31. A contrary impression in NSS data (Sanyal, 1984, Table 1) is due to&#13;
the inclusion of significant homestead and other non-farm land in&#13;
"ownership" but not in "operational" holdings.&#13;
32. Not least because the appropriate theory is that of the farm&#13;
household, with integrated decisions on production and consumption&#13;
(Barnum and Squire, 1979).&#13;
33. This need not weaken the case for reform. On the contrary, some&#13;
sorts of legislation, apparently intended to reduce poverty by&#13;
changing rights in land, are evaded in ways that actually support&#13;
that intension. See below.&#13;
34. Most comparisons (a) fail to separate differences in labor input and&#13;
output per acre, associated with sharecropping, from differences&#13;
associated with size -- normally sharecroppers have smaller holdings,&#13;
and thus more available family labor per acre, than owner-operators&#13;
(one would thus expect them to achieve yields better than owner-&#13;
operators (not just equally good), if the inverse relationship&#13;
applied and if sharecropping did not affect efficiency); (b) fail&#13;
(unlike Bell, 1977) to separate (i) one operator's input allocations&#13;
between sharecropped and owner-farmed land, and (ii) village-level&#13;
allocations between sharecropping and owner-occupying operators; (c)&#13;
fail to ask whether, even if all types of holding are farmed equally&#13;
(in)efficiently, total output would rise if the whole system of&#13;
tenure were changed, to all-owner-operated or all-sharecropped.&#13;
35. That is, the minimum of the average-cost curve is, for most crops (or&#13;
crop combinations) in most developing rural environments, likely to&#13;
occur as a fairly small operational holding size, say 1-6 acres per&#13;
household. This is more clearly so (a) if holding size is measured&#13;
per person or per worker, not per household; (b) if costs are&#13;
measured at social values, since smaller holdings are relatively&#13;
intensive users of unskilled (including off-peak) family labor with&#13;
low opportunity-cost, and relatively small users of subsidized&#13;
foreign exchange or capital-intensive purchased inputs, per acre.&#13;
36. (i) In the Indian NSS materials, the relevant data are for&#13;
"(household) ownership holdings" and "household (agricultural)&#13;
operational holdings". The data for "operational holdings" tout&#13;
court list the numbers of farm businesses in each size group. One&#13;
household sometimes owns only a part of an operational holding --&#13;
and, much more rarely, one household owns more than one operational&#13;
holding. The "household operational holding" is the area&#13;
corresponding to the household's share in the "operational holding"&#13;
-- or, rarely, in "operational holdings" (Sanyal, 1984, Table 1).&#13;
(ii) NSS data also classify households by area of "land possessed"&#13;
operational landholding whether agricultural or not (ibid., p. 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
37. A further, pragmatic, argument for using operational holdings is that&#13;
they are more easily observed, less sensitive in an environment of&#13;
agrarian reform, and thus more likely to be accurately reported, than&#13;
are ownership holdings. Leasing out is obviously and massively&#13;
understated by NSS - being allegedly 5 percent of leasing in - yet&#13;
some tenants, fearful of angering landlords, conceal even leasings-&#13;
in.&#13;
38. The Sri Lankan evidence (ILO, 1971) suggests that most households&#13;
classified as landless in fact have (own? operate?) a significant&#13;
patch of homestead land, around 0.4-0.8 acres. This usually grows&#13;
crops for home use, and often cassava, an important calorie source.&#13;
.39. Let Z be the nearest "NSS borderline", between ownership holdings,&#13;
above the "poverty-line holding" - that just sufficient to achieve a&#13;
non-poverty MEP. In each State, (i) H is the proportion of rural&#13;
households owning below Z; (ii) I is the proportion of Z by which the&#13;
average land area owned by the "sub-Z household" falls short of Z;&#13;
(iii) G is the Gini coefficient of land ownership among sub-Z&#13;
households. Then the LOP index (P) for a State (Sen, 1981) is given&#13;
by P = H (I+[1-I]G). See Sanyal, 1984, Table 5.&#13;
40. First, the Z "poverty" borderline used in Table 5 is in several&#13;
States set higher than the true borderline (2.5 areas in the Punjab,&#13;
against zero; 2.5 in Jammu (1); 2.5 in Uttar Pradesh (0.5)), so as to&#13;
permit G and I to be estimated, but implicitly overstating H.&#13;
Second, the NSS's discontinuous gaps between recorded holdings groups&#13;
imply overstatement of G. Third, there is a relationship, not&#13;
allowed for in these data, between low ownership holding and reliance&#13;
on other sources of income. Fourth, within-State heterogeneity --&#13;
associating worse land within a District (or sub-region) with higher&#13;
owned holdings - is not allowed for. Of course Sanyal is well aware&#13;
of all this - he is making the best of the available data.&#13;
41. The high LOP Sen index for 1971-72 in Maharashtra is due partly to&#13;
the 12.5-acre Z used (the evidence in Visaria, 1978, would suggest 10&#13;
acres); similarly, the high index in the Punjab is due to the 2.5-&#13;
acre Z.&#13;
42. Owners of small holdings are likely to state those holdings fairly&#13;
reliably. Owners of large holdings have two motives to understate&#13;
them: to conceal renting-out and thus evade laws giving rights to&#13;
benefits; and to conceal ownership as such, or operation, and thus&#13;
evade ceilings laws. Moreover, big owners are very unlikely to&#13;
report zero holdings or very small ones; they can satisfy both the&#13;
law and a hard-pressed (but moderately observant) interviewer by&#13;
reporting a significant, but legal, owned (and operated) area.&#13;
Operators have some motive to conceal land rented-in, if landlords&#13;
might retaliate against them for disclosure -- but the motive is&#13;
weak, since the survey hardly ever asks for the landlord's name, and&#13;
he is anyway unlikely to discover whether information has been&#13;
given. Land operation is directly observable even in the few days&#13;
that an NSS survey officer works in a village; it is thus rather&#13;
unlikely that an operator of land will claim to be a non-operator (he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
may well, if large, understate his holding). Renters out in India&#13;
massively understate their activities, but probably almost all in the&#13;
large ownership groups, which might be seriously affected by&#13;
legislation: rentals-in in NSS data in 1971-2 exeeded rentals-out by&#13;
20 to 1 (Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, p. 121).&#13;
43.  The emergence of this phenomenon can be seen by comparing Punjab-&#13;
Haryana (P-H) with all India (A-I) over time, in respect of (a)&#13;
percentage of ownership holdings below 1 acre, (b) average size of&#13;
those holdings. In the 8th round (1954-5), (a) was only 13.9 percent&#13;
for P-H (well below the 24.2 percent for A-I), and (b) was 0.24&#13;
acres, not much different from West Bengal (0.28), Uttar Pradesh&#13;
(0.27) or Orissa (0.27). In the 17th round (1960-1), (a) had leapt&#13;
to 40.8 percent for P-H (32.5 percent A-I) and (b) had fallen to 0.17&#13;
(W. Bengal and U.P. 0.25, Orissa 0.19). By the 26th round (1971-2),&#13;
(a) rose further to 48.8 percent for P-H (35.2 percent A-I) and (b)&#13;
fell to 0.07 (cp. 0.25 in W. Bengal, 0.27 in U.P. and Orissa). See&#13;
Sanyal, 1984, Tables 3 and 4. The major growth of non-farm activity&#13;
in P-H is plainly the main cause, especially if the Haryana survey&#13;
results of S. Bhalla (1983), that agricultural laborers are not&#13;
leasing out land, apply also in the Punjab. They may be selling itl&#13;
44.  Around 1980, he estimates 15.Om. Indian households as "non-&#13;
cultivators with income from wages over half total income" (average&#13;
family size 4.4), and 14.0m. "cultivators operating below 1 acre"&#13;
(5.0), out of 93.6m. rural households (5 6). The comparable figures&#13;
for Pakistan are 2.0 m. (4.5) and 0.2 m. (4.9) out of 10.1 m. (5.8)&#13;
and for Bangladesh 3.0 m. (4.6) and 1.1 m. (5.1) out of 14.3 m.&#13;
(5.8).&#13;
45.  An exception arises where most renting-out, by non-operating small&#13;
landowners, is on the basis of usufructuary mortgage. Sanyal (1984,&#13;
Table A.2) cites NSS data for 1971-2 to show that this was the case&#13;
for the 0.01-0.99 acre ownership group, in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,&#13;
Kerala, Haryana (not Punjab), and Tamil Nadu. However, in all these&#13;
cases, the proportion of this ownership group leasing out at all was&#13;
small -- respectively 7.8 percent, 10.3 percent, 3.5 percent and 8.0&#13;
percent - and there can have been little impact on the size of our&#13;
"potentially poor due to near-landless" groups.&#13;
46.  We seek to assess, not opportunity-costs, but direct (real) costs, to&#13;
be deducted from gross output and paid off the farm. The great&#13;
majority of farms below the size-limits of Table 6, col. 3, if they&#13;
operate what they own, can do so with family labor alone. Probably a&#13;
large majority, apart from exchange-labor, indeed does this.&#13;
47.  For assignment of States among regions, see Quizon and Pal (1983),&#13;
p. 2. Where a State is divided between regions, we average the cost&#13;
assignment; where a State is assigned "mostly" to one region but&#13;
"partly" to another, we weight them 2:1. Since three of the four&#13;
"divided" States are divided between the semi-arid tropical region&#13;
and coastal rice region, with closely similar shares of off-farm&#13;
costs in gross output (on our assumptions, for owner-occupiers in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
poorest quintile, 25 percent and 23 percent respectively), this can&#13;
involve serious error for only one State (Uttar Pradesh).&#13;
48. In the 0.02-5 acre group of operational holdings, livestock value&#13;
averaged 263 Rs/acre (Laxminarayan and Tyagi, 1982, p. 148). Four&#13;
papers to ICRISAT's 1983 Hyderabad conference on marketing estimated&#13;
the proportion of gross cereal output value comprised, in different&#13;
areas, by stalks for cattle; 15 percent was the lowest estimate.&#13;
49. The report (Labor Bureau, 1978, p. 7) refers to over 50 percent of&#13;
"total income", but in the context this must mean "total income from&#13;
employment" if the categories (agricultural labor, other rural labor,&#13;
and non-labor rural households) are to be mutually exclusive and&#13;
jointly exhaustive.&#13;
50.  The proportion of rural households who were agricultural laborers&#13;
i.e., whose main income source was agriculture, but not on operated&#13;
land - actually declined marginally, from 30.9 to 30.8 percent&#13;
(Bureau of Labor, 1978, pp. 22-3). Growing absolute landlessness and&#13;
proletarianization, at all-India level, is a myth.&#13;
51. Households operating no land fell from 56.1 percent to 50.8 percent&#13;
of agricultural laborers (ibid., p. 22), and such agriculture-&#13;
dependent households with no operational holding thus fell from 17.3&#13;
percent to 15.6 percent of all rural households (see fn. 50).&#13;
Unfortunately, Statewise data - and acreages operated -- are not&#13;
available.&#13;
52. Certainly, no such inferences can be drawn from the 1977-8 Land&#13;
Occupancy Survey. The two successive years involved distinct&#13;
samples, of different size and reliability (Cain, 1983). Also, the&#13;
period is far too short for trends to be inferred.&#13;
53. Of operational farms, rented or owned, 43 per cent covered below 7.5&#13;
acres (average size 3.7 acres) (Herring, p. 100). In 1970-71,&#13;
farmers owning below 5 acres appear to have enjoyed 50-60% higher&#13;
incomes than tenants, and about double the income of landless farm&#13;
laborers (Naseem, 1977, p. 49).&#13;

            Land assets and rural poverty
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Is private access to land the main
            insurance against rural poverty? Alternative forms of
            insurance such as customary, cooperative, collective, or
            common-property terms; off-farm income; access to
            "free" spare land appear to be dwindling, either
            in availability or in insurance value. In developing Asia
            and Africa private land forms an increasingly dominant share
            of rural productive assets. The tenancy relationship,
            however, does not uniformly increase or reduce poverty.
            Therefore (and even allowing for evasion), land reform,
            especially in well-watered areas, has been much more
            significant in reducing poverty -- and tenure reform, much
            less so -- than is often claimed. Both reforms must
            increasingly be judged by their effects on the landless and
            near-landless poor, but the numbers and growth of this group
            are often overstated. As with undernutrition, so with
            landlessness: the evidence that fewer poor people are
            affected than is sometimes claimed increases the urgency and
            feasibility of ameliorative action.
