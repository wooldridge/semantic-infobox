These achievements were made in the absence of                restructuring. To increase the attractiveness of firms to&#13;

must be clearly tradable and clearly included in the&#13;

            Russian privatization : an impressive record
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia's privatization record is
            impressive and unique. Participants at a June 1994 World
            Bank conference on privatization and the private sector in
            Russia concluded that it was irreversible, that the next
            stage of privatization--selling remaining shares and firms
            for cash through auctions and tenders--must be expedited,
            and that developing capital and securities markets and
            making business real estate tradable should get top
            priority. This Note reviews the privatization achievements
            of Russian reformers over the past three years, discusses
            emerging second-tier privatization and post-privatization
            issues, and summarizes the key themes in the papers
            presented at the World Bank-sponsored conference.
