ABSTRACT&#13;
The rate of growth of agricultural production in Sub-Saharan African countries&#13;
has been sluggish during the past two decades - total output expanded at 2.3%&#13;
per annum in the 1960s and at a meager rate of 1.3% in the 1970s. The result&#13;
has been that export growth has been unsatisfactory, food has emerged as a&#13;
difficult problem, and, in many countries, food imports have become burdensome&#13;
and/or the country has become dependent on food aid.&#13;
Agricultural output in these countries is the single most important&#13;
determinant of overall economic growth.     With the exception of some mineral&#13;
exporting countries, agricultural commodities account for two-thirds or more&#13;
of their export earnings. Composition of exports is rigid, and countries are&#13;
unable   to  insulate   themselves   against   excessive   instability   in  the&#13;
international prices and export demand for primary commodities.&#13;
This paper has been divided into three parts:        Part I presents a general&#13;
synthesis of Sub-Saharan agriculture, and outlines the domestic and global&#13;
constraints under which it has been developing; Part II summarizes the overall&#13;
price, trade and consumption outlook for major agricultural commodities&#13;
exported by the Sub-Saharan countries; and Part III presents brief notes on&#13;
the  outlook  for   individual  commodities.    The  projections   are  a  broad&#13;
indication of the trends; given the susceptability of commodity prices to&#13;
sharp fluctuations, the trend values should not be read as precise values for&#13;
individual years.&#13;

Part I: OVERVIEW&#13;
There are 47 countries    in sub-Saharan Africa.     Most of them are&#13;
sparsely populated with a rather narrow skill base.        Agriculture dominates&#13;
their economies and for a large number of them accounts for 30 to 60 percent&#13;
of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP).     In 1980, three-quarters of the total&#13;
labor force in the low-income countries and two-thirds of it in the middle-&#13;
income  countries worked   in agriculture    (Table  1).   Women   constitute  an&#13;
integral part of the labor force.&#13;
Except    where metals    and minerals   constitute   a country's main&#13;
export, 1/ agricultural commodities account for two-thirds or more of their&#13;
export earnings. In some cases (Burundi, Chad, Mali, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan,&#13;
Uganda, and the Ivory Coast), agricultural products are virtually the only&#13;
merchandise export.&#13;
Agricultural output is the single most important determinant of&#13;
overall economic growth. The economic problems of sub-Saharan Africa are thus&#13;
embedded in the agricultural sector and its performance in the face of&#13;
internal and external constraints faced by it.&#13;
Sluggish Growth&#13;
The rate of growth in agricultural output has been sluggish, and has&#13;
declined  steadily   in  the  past  two  decades.    Production   expanded  at  a&#13;
relatively low rate of 2.3% per annum in the 1960s and slowed to 1.3% per year&#13;
in the 1970s.   In per capita terms, this represented negative growth both for&#13;
1/ Niger (uranium), Sierra Leone (diamonds), Togo (phosphates), Zaire&#13;
(copper), Angola (petroleum), Congo, P.R. (petroleum), Liberia (iron ore),&#13;
Gabon (petroleum), Mauritania (iron ore), Nigeria (petroleum), and Zambia&#13;
(copper).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the region as a whole and for most of the countries. The only countries that&#13;
experienced a positive per capita rate of agricultural growth for 1969-71 to&#13;
1977-79 were Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, and Upper Volta among the low-income&#13;
countries, and Cameroon, Kenya, Ivory Coast, 1/ Mauritius, and Swaziland among&#13;
the middle-income countries (Table 2).&#13;
In 1970-79, cropped area expanded by 8% or less than 1% p.a. A large&#13;
part of the increase was confined to a few countries (Cameroon, Ivory Coast,&#13;
Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Upper Volta) where the&#13;
total area cropped increased by 23%; increases elsewhere were very small&#13;
(Table 3). Given the relatively large areas under pasture, there exists in&#13;
several countries the potential for significantly expanding cropped areas.&#13;
Increases in yields did not fully compensate for the slow increase in cropped&#13;
area. In 1961-80, commendable yield increases were recorded by tea, which was&#13;
helped by clonal propagation, sugar cane, wheat, and soybeans (in Nigeria).&#13;
But yields of other crops have either declined (as in coffee, sorghum,&#13;
groundnuts) or have shown small increases and have been steadily declining in&#13;
relation to yields elsewhere in the world (Table 4).&#13;
The 1970s were not necessarily an unusual period in the growth of&#13;
sub-Saharan agriculture. The long-term trend (1964-80) 2/ indicates that the&#13;
growth in the production of major crops has exceeded population growth only&#13;
for tea and sugar, two export crops faced with severe external market&#13;
constraints (as discussed later in this paper), whereas rice production more&#13;
or less kept pace with population growth (Table 5). In most other crops, with&#13;

the notable exception of tobacco, the trend growth rate in production has been&#13;
lower than the growth of domestic and/or export demand. The result has been&#13;
that the economies of these countries are pressed by both the unsatisfactory&#13;
export growth of cash crops and the rising import burden of cereals and&#13;
cooking oils.&#13;
Food Problem&#13;
Food has emerged as a difficult problem.      Production of cereals in&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa expanded at 1.7% p.a. in 1964-80, whereas the volume of&#13;
imports rose by 8.2% p.a.     Exports of cereals are relatively small and are&#13;
confined to a few exporting countries, 1/ whereas imports that are sizable in&#13;
relative terms have become common for the region.     Food self-sufficiency has&#13;
been declining in virtually every country (Table 6). The comparative standing&#13;
of sub-Saharan countries    in this   respect  is also  low.   For example, in&#13;
Nigeria, a large petroleum exporting middle-income country, the food self-&#13;
sufficiency ratio in 1978-80 was significantly lower than that for Indonesia -&#13;
a country with similar characteristics.&#13;
Diminishing food self-sufficiency whereby incremental demand for food&#13;
is met by imports may be a perfectly rational policy to follow for a country&#13;
with a buoyant export sector. However, where declining self-sufficiency is a&#13;
reflection of declining per capita national food output, it is a matter of&#13;
serious concern.&#13;
As is typical of developing countries, rice and wheat are preferred&#13;
foods in the sub-Saharan countries and have a much higher income elasticity of&#13;
1/ Wheat is exported by Zimbabwe, rice by Malawi, maize by Kenya, Tanzania,&#13;
and Zimbabwe, and other grains by Niger, Sudan, and Tanzania.&#13;

demand than do coarse grains (maize, millets, sorghums). Roots and tubers are&#13;
considered an inferior food. Unfortunately, the preference for wheat and rice&#13;
is being fuelled by consumer subsidies, food aid, and indirect subsidies&#13;
through over-valued exchange rates. Subsidized prices for wheat and rice have&#13;
not only depressed prices of traditional food crops, but also destabilized&#13;
them.&#13;
Structure of Trade&#13;
The food problem is also illustrated by the structure of sub-Saharan&#13;
imports. In some countries (Somalia, Upper Volta, Zaire, Mauritius, Reunion,&#13;
Senegal, Seychelles, Congo, P.R.) food imports in 1978 exceeded one-fifth of&#13;
their total imports.     Food imports typically tend to be large in petroleum&#13;
exporting countries, but even if these countries are excluded, sub-Saharan&#13;
imports of food exceeded fuel imports       (Table A).    By 1995 sub-Sahara is&#13;
projected to account for one-quarter of world rice imports.&#13;

Manufactures constitute an overwhelming share of sub-Saharan imports&#13;
but manufacturing for export has not yet taken root. The result is that the&#13;
sub-Saharan countries are "locked" into a commodity-oriented structure of&#13;
exports.   This makes them highly vulnerable to the "commodity problem" as&#13;
characterized by heavy dependence on a limited range of exportable products,&#13;
extreme price instability, and sluggish growth in export demand.&#13;
Commodity Problem&#13;
Sub-Saharan countries are heavily dependent on primary commodity&#13;
exports for their foreign exchange earnings, more than any other region of the&#13;
world. Furthermore, one or two commodities usually account for the bulk of&#13;
each country's exports.   The data presented in Table 7, listing up to five of&#13;
the  principal   agricultural   products   exported  by   each  country,   total&#13;
agricultural exports, and agriculture as a share of total merchandise exports,&#13;
reveal the lack of diversification in their exports. Mozambique and Tanzania,&#13;
among the low-income, and the Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, among the&#13;
middle-income group, are the only countries with somewhat of a range of&#13;
agricultural exports.    Mozambique is the most diversified, being the only&#13;
country where two products constitute less than one-half of total agricultural&#13;
exports.&#13;
The   commodity   composition   of  sub-Saharan   Africa   has   become&#13;
increasingly rigid in the past two decades. A smaller number of products have&#13;
steadily come to occupy a larger part of aggregate agricultural exports (Table&#13;
B).&#13;

Month-to-month price variations can be so sharp that prices double or&#13;
halve within a year.     Annual price fluctuations are substantial (Table 12).&#13;
Prices of sugar, cocoa, copra, coffee, rice, and rubber are notoriously&#13;
unstable.   Furthermore, volume fluctuations for individual countries can be&#13;
large depending on the size of crops, exportable supplies, and government&#13;
policies. Since primary commodities constitute such a large proportion of the&#13;
exports of the sub-Saharan countries, export revenues experience large&#13;
fluctuations  (Table 9).     It should be noted that revenue instability is&#13;
largest for the high-income oil exporters (dependence on a single commodity).&#13;
Terms of Trade&#13;
In the past three decades, world prices of agricultural commodities&#13;
relative to world prices of manufactured products have tended to fall.       This&#13;
has resulted in declining barter terms of trade for the countries that rely&#13;
heavily  on agricultural   commodities  for their export    revenues.    In this&#13;
respect, the period 1978-81 was especially difficult for the oil-importing&#13;
sub-Saharan  countries.    The  terms  of  trade  of  the low-income    countries&#13;

experienced a net decline of 13% in 1978-81 and those of the middle-income oil&#13;
importing countries a decline of 16%. Terms of trade losses were particularly&#13;
large for Ethiopia (-27%), Kenya (-19%), Madagascar (-26%), Tanzania (-16%),&#13;
Ghana (-36%), Ivory Coast (-30%), and Sudan (-21%) (Table 10).       These losses&#13;
reflect the increase in the price of imported oil, the rise in the prices of&#13;
manufactured imports, and the decline in the prices of most commodity exports.&#13;
Not all of the losses in terms of trade are expected to be regained&#13;
in 1982-90.    Limited gains in 1982-90 are expected for countries exporting&#13;
agricultural raw materials but none for exporters of beverages.       In fact, if&#13;
countries exporting metals (e.g., Zambia) are excluded, the remaining oil-&#13;
importing countries would continue to suffer terms of trade losses up to 1990&#13;
(Table 10).&#13;
Market Outlook&#13;
As is discussed in Parts II and III, over the period 1980-95 the&#13;
volume of world trade in tea, rice, coarse grains, beef, lemons, soybeans,&#13;
palm oil, coconuts, rubber, and tobacco is expected to grow by 3% per year or&#13;
more. However, sub-Saharan exports will expand by 3% or more only for tea and&#13;
tobacco.   Long-term price prospects are quite favorable for natural rubber,&#13;
cotton,  and  tobacco.    Agricultural  commodities  which face an encouraging&#13;
market outlook loom large in the exports of only nine countries - Chad,&#13;
Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Sudan, Tanzania, Upper Volta, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. A&#13;
commodity which illustrates sub-Sahara's loss of a buoyant export market is&#13;
palm oil (Table C).&#13;
Two of the commodities in which the sub-Saharan countries showed&#13;
impressive improvements in increasing output and raising productivity - tea&#13;
and sugar - are faced with market constraints. The real price of tea has been&#13;

falling and is likely to weaken even further up to 1995.         Sugar has been&#13;
suffering because of the high protection given to production in the industrial&#13;
countries. The cost of producing cane sugar is significantly lower than the&#13;
cost of producing beet sugar; moreover, the developing countries can supply&#13;
the quantities   demanded  by world markets.      But in spite of the strong&#13;
comparative advantage enjoyed by the developing-country producers, the&#13;
European Community is a net exporter of sugar.&#13;
The sub-Saharan countries have been in large part subject to slow&#13;
growth because their technological base is narrow, their manpower is mostly&#13;
untrained, and their infrastructure is underdeveloped.     Thus, diversification&#13;
into industrial activity has been slow.     It is especially difficult to lift&#13;
economic growth in the early stages of economic development when resources,&#13;
both physical and human, are so limited.     But some countries have managed to&#13;
achieve success through the use of open trading and investment policies. Some&#13;
have diversified their agriculture (Ivory Coast) and others have moved into&#13;
manufacturing (Kenya).&#13;
Areas of Action&#13;
Possible areas of action to enhance the prospects for aggregate&#13;
export earnings are: increasing total production and diversification of crops&#13;
to fully avail of the market opportunities that do exist in the world,&#13;
increasing yields to augment sub-Saharan competitiveness, increasing the&#13;
value-added component of exports by expanding processing, and stabilizing or&#13;
raising world prices through international action.&#13;
The export problem of the sub-Saharan countries is essentially one of&#13;
supply constraints. These countries hold a small share of the world market in&#13;
most products; moreover, this share has been falling except in tea.        These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
commodities could regain the lost share or even increase it without upsetting&#13;
world markets by their taking over market shares from the more rapidly&#13;
advancing developing countries which are graduating out of primary commodity&#13;
exports. They could also capture a large part of the market growth in several&#13;
products for which prospects are promising.       This has not been happening&#13;
primarily because of the inadequate growth of agricultural production.&#13;
Inappropriate domestic price and incentive policies lie at the heart&#13;
of the agricultural problem. Agriculture is in most cases the main source of&#13;
government revenue.    Governments therefore have proceeded to tax agriculture&#13;
to finance investments. This has proven to be self-defeating. Heavy taxes on&#13;
exports, inappropriate exchange rates, and lack of price incentives have&#13;
tended to choke the growth of production and exports. This applies to cereals&#13;
for domestic consumption as well as to export crops - for example cocoa in&#13;
Ghana.    If,  on the   other hand,   governments  were  to provide   production&#13;
incentives, the increased output and exports will provide an expanding rather&#13;
than a contracting taxbase.&#13;
Diversification   of  export   crops  is   essential  both  to   reduce&#13;
instability and to avail of new export opportunities. This typically happens&#13;
with appropriate producer prices, agricultural extension, and marketing&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Although appropriate policies to rectify the neglect of the 1970s and&#13;
rehabilitate crops and agricultural infrastructure are an immediate issue, the&#13;
agricultural problem is apt to remain with sub-Sahara for decades to come.&#13;
Therefore, long-run measures need to be planned simultaneously.       One of the&#13;
goals that needs to be kept in the forefront is bridging the yield gap faced&#13;
by these countries. This would require massive investments in infrastructure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

land development, irrigation, and a range of technological improvements. Each&#13;
country and each region faces special problems but there may be something to&#13;
emulate from the well-documented success stories. 1/&#13;
Opportunities for processing are particularly promising in tropical&#13;
timber and in cocoa, cotton and tobacco.        In timber, cocoa, and cotton,&#13;
considerable processing has been underway.    However, it is important to note&#13;
that the rate at which the remaining forests are being destroyed in the sub-&#13;
Sahara is one of the true disasters on the continent.     In other commodities,&#13;
expansion of processing is faced with formidable obstacles.     The price ratio&#13;
between raw and intermediate products is largely set in the industrial&#13;
countries. Also, exports of processed products face escalating tariffs and&#13;
other barriers in the industrial countries. In the short-run, countries could&#13;
face a loss of revenue although in the long-run, gains - particularly&#13;
secondary benefits - could be substantial.&#13;
A cooperative international effort is warranted in some products,&#13;
particularly coffee, cocoa, and tea.      Demand growth of consumption in the&#13;
1/ In the 1950s and the early 1960s, Mexican agriculture had one of the&#13;
highest growth rates in the world, averaging 4 to 7% every year.&#13;
Performance was based largely on technological improvements closely linked&#13;
to expanded irrigation.&#13;
In the Punjab, in India, irrigation associated with government investment&#13;
in roads, markets, rural electrification, and other infrastructure and&#13;
price incentives led to a phenomenal growth of agricultural output as well&#13;
as a sharp rise in the production of new crops hitherto not grown&#13;
extensively in that State.&#13;
The downstream effects of irrigation can be massive.     A World Bank study&#13;
of an irrigation project in Malaysia indicated that for every dollar of&#13;
increased paddy output, another $0.75 of income was generated in&#13;
downstream effects.&#13;
(World Development Report, 1982, pp. 61, 63).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

industrial countries for these products is relatively slow because per capita&#13;
consumption has reached near saturation levels. The elasticity of demand for&#13;
these  commodities   with  respect  to   price  is  also  low.     Global  price&#13;
elasticities of demand are estimated at -0.2 for coffee, -0.3 for cocoa, and&#13;
-0.25 for tea.     A price elasticity of -0.2 means that, for the market to&#13;
absorb 1% of additional supplies, prices would have to fall by 5%.          When&#13;
elasticities are low, the producers do not benefit from bringing additional&#13;
supplies into the market. 1/&#13;
International Commodity Agreements exist for coffee and cocoa, but&#13;
have not been very effective in limiting production.       A sticky problem in&#13;
international agreements in general has been the setting of country export&#13;
quotas; moreover, powerful consumer interests have acted as a divisive&#13;
force.&#13;
The opportunities for international cooperation and for increasing&#13;
total export revenues in tea are even greater, provided the major producers&#13;
(India and Sri Lanka) surrender a larger share of the market to the newer&#13;
producers (those in Africa) and provided these new producers expand only up to&#13;
the point where the revenues for both small and large exporters are&#13;
maximized. The economics is simple, 2/ but the implementation is difficult.&#13;
Besides providing massive assistance to raise yields and thus output,&#13;
and to improve infrastructure for efficient marketing, the industrial&#13;
countries can assist the sub-Saharan countries by giving, for a fixed period,&#13;

definitive preferential access to imports from these countries as compared to&#13;

considerable enlargement of the access now given by the European Communities&#13;

and which currently face restrictions include sugar, tobacco, fruits and&#13;

Part II: PRICE AND TRADE OUTLOOK FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES&#13;
The short-term Developments&#13;
Agricultural commodity prices in world markets, measured in, 1/&#13;
current dollars, fell sharply - by 19% - in 1981 (Table 13). The 21% decline&#13;
in food prices resulted from the fall in the prices of sugar (-41%), cocoa&#13;
(-20%), coffee (-17%), and tea (-9%). Fats and oils particularly, groundnuts&#13;
and groundnut oil and the major grains, except sorghum, posted higher average&#13;
prices. Non-food agricultural raw materials were hit hardest by the declines&#13;
in the prices of rubber (-20%), and to a lesser extent cotton (-6%). Tropical&#13;
timber prices also registered a steep fall.&#13;
The main negative influence on primary commodity prices, especially&#13;
industrial raw materials, has been the persistence of slow economic growth,&#13;
high inflation, and high interest rates in the industrial countries.&#13;
Agricultural commodities most directly and obviously affected by the&#13;
industrial stagnation were rubber (automobile industry), cotton (textile&#13;
industry), and timber (housing and construction industries).&#13;
Sub-Saharan exporters of primary commodities were severely hit by the&#13;
1981 price movements on both the export and the import side. The price falls&#13;
were pronounced for the products exported by these countries whereas prices&#13;
rose on balance for those for which they are importers.&#13;
Agricultural commodity prices, in current dollars, fell by another&#13;
10% in 1982. In real terms, the prices were the lowest since the "great&#13;

depression" of the 1930s.     The factors that further depressed the commodity&#13;
markets were essentially the same as in 1981.&#13;
The declines were widespread:    in particular, sugar prices halved in&#13;
1982; and prices of groundnuts and groundnut products fell by over 40%. After&#13;
coffee and cocoa, these products constitute the largest component of Sub-&#13;
Saharan countries' agricultural exports. The declines in cereal prices were&#13;
triggered by the record harvests in North America in 1981-82, but the food&#13;
problem for Sub-Sahara remained precarious.&#13;
If, as is anticipated, world economic conditions, especially those in&#13;
industrial countries, improve in 1983, commodity prices should recover from&#13;
the very   low levels   of 1982.    Yet only after 1985 would prices      in the&#13;
aggregate return close to their 1980 levels in current dollar terms (Table&#13;
13). The outlook is much less favorable when examined from the standpoint of&#13;
constant dollar prices (Table 14).&#13;
The shape of the commodity price recovery predicted for 1983-85&#13;
reflects closely that of the economic cycle in the industrial countries.      The&#13;
economic upturn is not expected to be as sharp and concentrated in time as say&#13;
in 1975-76, but rather more gentle and protracted, mirroring the downturn&#13;
phase of the cycle.    The demand recovery is expected to be more quickly and&#13;
sharply reflected in the prices of non-food agricultural products than in&#13;
those of food products. The prices of coffee and cocoa should remain weak in&#13;
the medium term as a consequence of the excess capacity build-up of the recent&#13;
past. Sugar, too, is currently plagued by excess capacity, due in part to the&#13;
price support policies in key high-income producing areas and in part to the&#13;
slow growth of demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
The long-term Price Outlook: 1983-95&#13;
After recovering in 1983-85, as the cycle in world economic activity&#13;
turns upwards, agricultural commodity prices in constant dollars are projected&#13;
to increase but the overall upward trend is expected to be quite gentle (Chart&#13;
1).   The relatively slow trend growth in the world economy foreseen during&#13;
this period is not expected to generate demands for agricultural commodities&#13;
in excess of realizable production capacities.&#13;
Food commodities face especially unfavorable price prospects.     Their&#13;
prices, in constant dollars, should remain below historical trends throughout&#13;
the projection period    (Table  14).   This outcome is determined largely by&#13;
beverage prices, which have a large weight (about 83%) within the food&#13;
group. Chronic oversupply is expected in both coffee and cocoa until the end&#13;
of the current decade, and prices, in constant 1981 dollars, are not expected&#13;
to recover much even by 1995.       Tea prices are expected to continue their&#13;
secular decline.     Cereal prices,   after recovering   in the mid-1980s,    are&#13;
expected to remain around these same levels until the mid-1990s.        Fats and&#13;
oils prices should continue to recover beyond the mid-1980s, but then decline&#13;
again, in constant dollars, in the 1990s, reflecting the strongly cyclical&#13;
nature of their supply.&#13;
Non-food agricultural product prices are projected to increase&#13;
steadily from 1983 onwards, reflecting the effect of the expected demand&#13;
recovery and, after 1983-84, the continuation of cost-push pressures on&#13;
synthetic substitutes.     Long-term price prospects are quite favorable for&#13;
natural rubber, cotton, and tobacco. Only sisal 1/ is expected to continue to&#13;
face sharp price and non-price competition from synthetic substitutes.&#13;
1/ Sisal, not included in the World Bank index for commodity Prices, faces&#13;
similar market conditions to those of jute, though the two have different&#13;
end uses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Tropical timber prices are projected to increase from the mid-1980s&#13;
to the mid-1990s, faster than those of any other commodity group considered&#13;
here.   The continuation of the upward trend in prices reflects both the&#13;
reduced accessibility of tropical forestry products and producer policies&#13;
aimed at encouraging local processing and capturing a larger portion of the&#13;
rents.&#13;
These   long-term  price   forecasts  are   obviously  conditional   in&#13;
nature. On the demand side they rest critically on the assumptions made about&#13;
the evolution of the world economy in the 1980s and 1990s.       (Tables 11 and&#13;
12). On the supply side they are based also on the most likely assumptions&#13;
concerning government policies affecting production and exports.&#13;
These key assumptions could easily be in error. One should also keep&#13;
in mind that commodity prices show severe short-term fluctuations caused by&#13;
unanticipated demand and supply variations.     Beyond 1982-83, these forecasts&#13;
present only the likely price trends.     Actual prices in any particular year&#13;
may differ substantially from the trend prices.&#13;
Outlook For Consumption and Trade:&#13;
Over the past 20 years the fastest trend growth in world consumption&#13;
(greater than 3%) has been in palm oil, soybeans, oranges, limes and lemons,&#13;
rubber, tea, wheat, and tropical hardwood (Table 15).     Palm oil and soybeans&#13;
gained partly from their substitution for other fats and oils.     Demand growth&#13;
for cotton and rubber was dampened by competition from synthetic substitutes&#13;
but the impact was particularly strong for jute and sisal.     Growth in demand&#13;
for tobacco has been constrained mostly in the industrial countries, because&#13;
of progressive saturation and health concerns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The agricultural commodities facing the most favorable overall&#13;
prospects for growth in consumption during 1980-95 are exactly the same as&#13;
those (except timber) that experienced rapid expansion in 1961-80.        Because&#13;
tea is a much cheaper beverage than coffee, the scope for demand expansion&#13;
within   developing  countries   seems  much  more   favorable.     In  addition,&#13;
consumption of cereals, sugar, cotton, and tobacco is projected to grow&#13;
rapidly in the developing countries, as also in sub-Sahara, and the share of&#13;
these regions in world consumption will expand significantly (Table 15).&#13;
Tobacco consumption is expected to experience a significantly faster&#13;
growth than in the past.    The developing countries now account for over half&#13;
of total consumption, and tobacco consumption in these countries is expected&#13;
to increase about 1% p.a. faster than it did over the 1961-80 period.&#13;
In sugar, the sub-Saharan countries are expected to experience the&#13;
sharpest growth in demand.     Sugar consumption there is very low and income&#13;
elasticities  of demand   are  still relatively high.     Their share of world&#13;
consumption should rise.   The share of sugar in total sweetener consumption of&#13;
the industrial countries has been declining, in part due to competition from&#13;
sugar substitutes.&#13;
The projected stagnation of tropical hardwood consumption in the&#13;
industrial countries and centrally planned economies is mainly because of the&#13;
conservation measures introducted by the major producers.&#13;
The agricultural products which are expected to experience the most&#13;
rapid growth in trade during 1980-95 are coarse grains, soybeans, palm oil,&#13;
beef and veal, rubber, and lemons.&#13;
The main impetus for the growth in the coarse grains trade is&#13;
expected to come from imports by the centrally planned economies.       The sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Saharan countries are also expected to continue to import coarse grains at a&#13;
fast rate, largely because of their inability to produce sufficient staple&#13;
foodstuffs to meet the growing demand caused by population growth.&#13;
The main growth in imports of palm oil is in the developing&#13;
countries.   Trade in beef and veal should continue to grow at close to its&#13;
historical rate.   Almost half of world imports of beef and veal occur within&#13;
the European Communities.&#13;
Trade in natural rubber is also expected to continue to grow at a&#13;
healthy rate.    Given its price and non-price competitiveness with synthetic&#13;
rubbers, the only constraint to an even faster possible trade growth comes&#13;
from the supply side.    Demand for rubber products is expected to grow faster&#13;
in developing than in industrial countries.&#13;
The decline in the growth of cotton exports during 1961-80 reflected&#13;
the increasing manufacture of apparel, clothing, and textiles in developing&#13;
countries.   Cotton imports by the industrial countries are also projected to&#13;
continue to decline.     In the developing countries manufacturing has been&#13;
expanding faster than cotton growing. Hence the share of developing countries&#13;
in world cotton exports has declined, and is expected to continue to do so.&#13;
The developing countries' share of imports should increase, however, primarily&#13;
as a result of the expected increase in imports by China.&#13;
Imports of coffee are concentrated in the industrial countries.     The&#13;
United States is still the major market, but soft drinks, fruit juices, iced&#13;
tea, and other beverages over the past two decades have led to declining&#13;
coffee consumption there.   This may well happen in Western Europe in the near&#13;
future.   Low population growth, slow income growth, and low price and income&#13;
elasticities are expected to constrain growth in world coffee imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The overall picture for export quantities and prices until the mid-&#13;
1990s is not very encouraging.    Developing countries, almost irrespective of&#13;
the product composition of their non-fuel commodity exports, do not seem&#13;
likely to be able to derive from them alone a growth in real purchasing power&#13;
sufficient to sustain development efforts at desired levels.&#13;
The prospects for the sub-Saharan countries are particularly poor.&#13;
With the exception of tea and tobacco, their share in world exports of&#13;
agricultural commodities is expected to decline in 1980-95 (Table 17).&#13;
Inadequate supplies will be the main constraining factor, depriving the&#13;
continent of opportunities to avail of the growth in world import demand in&#13;
many commodities.&#13;

COFFEE&#13;
Coffee prices remained low in 1960-75, except for a short-lived boom&#13;
in 1964 and again in 1970 caused by severe frost damage to the crop in&#13;
Brazil.   Coffee prices in 1981 constant dollars rose sharply in 1976, again&#13;
following a frost in Brazil, reaching a record high of 7472/kg in 1977.&#13;
Prices have since been declining with recovery in Brazilian production and&#13;
expansion elsewhere.    Due to a substantially increasing supply and a slowly&#13;
growing demand, they should remain historically low until the early 1990s,&#13;
when some recovery should take place as production growth slows down.&#13;
Nonetheless, real prices in 1995 at 3150/kg will still be close to the average&#13;
levels prevailing in the 1960s.&#13;
World production has been increasing since 1976.    With expected slow&#13;
demand growth, low prices, International Coffee Agreement quotas, and&#13;
increasing stock levels, some countries are scaling down their production&#13;
plans (notably Colombia and Indonesia).    However, the combination of higher-&#13;
yield trees recently planted in several countries and current rates of new&#13;
planting should cause world production to continue to increase rapidly until&#13;
the late 1980s.    Total world production, which averaged 80 million bags in&#13;
1980, is expected to reach 93-94 million bags in the mid-1980s and increase&#13;
gradually to 98 million bags by the mid-1990s.&#13;
Consumption is projected to increase at the relatively high rate of&#13;
2.4% p.a. during the period 1980-85 due to low world coffee prices. However,&#13;
the secular growth trend of world consumption is only about 1.3% p.a.&#13;
Therefore, world production should not increase at more than 1.3% p.a. if real&#13;
prices are to be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
About 60% of world consumption and about 75% of world imports are&#13;
accounted for by Western Europe and North America alone. Apparent consumption&#13;
in the United States, the world's largest consumer, has been declining at 1.9%&#13;
p.a. for two decades.   The factors responsible include competition from other&#13;
beverages and health considerations.&#13;
In Western Europe, consumption increased at a high rate of 2.7% p.a.&#13;
in 1961-80.    Consumption growth was especially strong in the EC.      Germany,&#13;
which consumes high quality coffee (as do the Scandinavian countries), almost&#13;
doubled its consumption in the last two decades.         However,  there is now&#13;
increasing competition from other beverages in Western Europe, as in the&#13;
United States.   Japan has also recorded high consumption growth - more than&#13;
10-fold in 20 years; in recent years, its consumption growth has slowed.&#13;
Coffee consumption in the Eastern Europe and the USSR increased at&#13;
4.3% p.a. during the period 1961-80--seemingly in response to income growth;&#13;
during 1980-85 it should grow at 2.9% p.a.&#13;
Fast increases in consumption were also recorded in non-producing&#13;
developing countries (4.1% p.a. during 1961-80) in response to population and&#13;
income growth. Non-producing developing countries should continue to increase&#13;
their consumption at 6.0% and 3.0% p.a. for the periods 1980-85 and 1985-90,&#13;
respectively.   Since their per capita consumption level is still low, the&#13;
potential for substantial long-term growth exists, provided that prices stay&#13;
low  and  their  economies   grow  at  a  fairly  high  rate.    Total  domestic&#13;
consumption in producing countries grew at only 0.6% p.a. during the period&#13;
1961-80. The future growth rate should be about the same.&#13;
Exports from producing countries are expected to grow at the high&#13;
rate of 3% p.a. during 1980-85 as world production increases rapidly. Export&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
growth is expected to slow down to 1.7% p.a. in 1985-90 and then to 0.9% p.a.&#13;
in 1990-95.    Stocks held in producing countries should be reduced by 1990,&#13;
thereby increasing coffee prices in the early 1990s.&#13;
Coffee faces a very low price elasticity of world demand.         Over-&#13;
production by even a small quantity puts significant downward pressure on&#13;
prices.   (With an estimated price elasticity of world demand of -0.24, a 1%&#13;
increase in world supply, other things being equal, would depress world coffee&#13;
prices by about 4%.)   Even if the projected prices would give good returns on&#13;
investment, large production increases in major producing countries should be&#13;
discouraged, as increasing coffee production would reduce real prices and in&#13;
turn the combined coffee export revenues of all producing countries.&#13;
Since 1962, coffee exports have been regulated under successive&#13;
International Coffee Agreements (ICA).    Members of the ICA include about 90%&#13;
of world importers and 99% of world exporters.       At the beginning of every&#13;
coffee season (September), members decide on the global quota and the price&#13;
range within which it will operate, and on country quotas for the next 12&#13;
months.    If  prices  increase,   global  and  individual  country  quotas  are&#13;
increased by agreed steps until, at a certain price, the quotas are completely&#13;
lifted.   If prices decline in spite of the implementation of the initial&#13;
global quota, the quotas are progressively reduced.&#13;
For the ICA to be effective in supporting prices in the long run,&#13;
global quotas should not increase faster than the rate of world import demand&#13;
growth (estimatd at 1.3% p.a.)     Thus, production increases by major coffee&#13;
exporters should be compatible with world demand growth.&#13;

COCOA&#13;
Historically cocoa prices in real terms have shown a strong cyclical&#13;
pattern but no clear trend.    Prices in 1982-95 are expected to repeat the low&#13;
levels experienced in 1961-67. In 1981 constant dollars, prices are projected&#13;
to decline to US1460/kg in 1985 and stay at this low level until the early&#13;
1990s, when some recovery is expected. In 1995, the price is projected to be&#13;
US1739/kg. Cocoa prices in 1981 had averaged US208Q/kg.&#13;
The sharp decline in cocoa prices in 1980-82 resulted from (i)&#13;
rapidly increasing supply, (ii) stagnant demand as a result of economic&#13;
stagnation in the main consuming regions, (iii) considerable appreciation of&#13;
the US dollar against other major currencies, and (iv) high interest rates in&#13;
major industrial countries which made holding stocks very costly.&#13;
Production is projected to increase at about 4.5% p.a. until 1985 and&#13;
at about 2% p.a. during the remainder of the 1980s.        Production growth in&#13;
1980-85 should thus be considerably higher than the long-term 2% p.a. growth&#13;
of demand. If supply does grow more than 2% p.a., prices will have to decline&#13;
substantially to maintain market equilibrium.&#13;
The sharply increasing supply from major cocoa producers is the&#13;
result of large-scale plantings carried out in Brazil, the Ivory Coast, and&#13;
Malaysia in response to the high prices in 1976 and 1977.      Another important&#13;
factor contributing to the large increase in supply in recent years has been&#13;
the planting, initiated in the early 1970s, of a hybrid variety with a yield&#13;
about twice that of the traditional variety.&#13;
The phenomenal growth of Brazilian production should continue, with&#13;
production reaching 550,000 tons by 1990.     Malaysia increased its acreage by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
more than 200% since 1973.    Production should more than double in the next 5&#13;
years, to about 120,000 tons, and reach 150,000 tons by the late 1980s.&#13;
In sub-Sahara, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer&#13;
has been planting high-yield trees since the early 1970s; moreover, it doubled&#13;
its cocoa acreage in the last 10 years.     Its production should reach perhaps&#13;
to 600,000 tons in 1990.       Nigeria's production, declining since 1970, is&#13;
expected to stabilize; Ghana's production is expected to stagnante or decline&#13;
slowly throughout the 1980s; other countries are projected to produce about&#13;
the same or even lower quantities of cocoa in the remainder of the 1980s&#13;
compared with their current levels. In aggregate, sub-Sahara's share in world&#13;
output will continue to decline.&#13;
Per capita consumption is very high in the industrial countries about&#13;
1.5-1.9 kg/person in the late 1970s; it showed no appreciable growth during&#13;
the period 1961-80.     It is expected to reach saturation level at about 2&#13;
kg/per person by 1990.    Per capita consumption in the CPEs is still low in&#13;
comparison, at about 0.6-0.7 kg/person, despite its 4.4% p.a. increase during&#13;
the period 1961-80.     Total consumption is expected to continue to grow at&#13;
about 3.5% p.a.     Consumption in developing countries     is very low; it is&#13;
expected to grow substantially in the future, but the base is so low that it&#13;
will not have a significant impact on world demand for the next 10 years.&#13;
The chocolate industry in industrial countries is oligopolistic.     In&#13;
most industrial countries, four or five firms control over half of the&#13;
market.    Although  an increasing amount    of processing   is carried out    in&#13;
developing countries, it is generally done under contract with major firms of&#13;
industrial countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Cocoa exports governed under the International Cocoa Agreement came&#13;
into force in August 1981.     It aims at stabilizing cocoa prices through the&#13;
operation of buffer stocks.    The largest producer, the Ivory Coast, and the&#13;
largest consumer, the United States, still are not members. The buffer stock&#13;
operations of the Agreement have not been effective in stabilizing prices&#13;
because of inadequate funding of the buffer stock and failure of major&#13;
producing countries to undertake orderly expansion of output.&#13;
In recent years, producing developing countries have increased their&#13;
exports of semi-processed cocoa products substantially compared with their&#13;
bean exports.   One reason is the reduction of tariffs on these products by&#13;
major consumers. Much of the cocoa product trade is now either free or faces&#13;
only small nominal tariffs in the EC and the United States.      However, there&#13;
are   still  some  restrictions   such   as  the  US   limitation  on   the  GSP&#13;
implementation and non-tariff constraints.&#13;

TEA&#13;
Since 1955 the price of tea in constant dollars has been declining at&#13;
over 2.5% p.a., disturbed only by the price boom of 1977 which was caused&#13;
mainly by the sharp rise in coffee prices. As output continues to grow faster&#13;
than consumption,   tea prices in constant dollars Are expected to continue&#13;
their decline   over the 1982-95 period--although more slowly than in the&#13;
past.   In 1981 constant dollars, tea prices are expected to fall by 3.2% in&#13;
1980-85, to 195C/kg in 1982 and to 189C/kg in 1983.      After declining further&#13;
to 171Q/kg in 1985 they should cyclically recover to 184Â¢/kg in 1990 but&#13;
decline again to 174;/kg in 1995.&#13;
Since the 1960s, production has grown fastest in East Africa (Kenya,&#13;
Malawi, and Tanzania), Turkey, and the USSR.      Growth of production has been&#13;
falling in India and in Sri Lanka. Recently tea production in China has been&#13;
increasing very rapidly, making China the second largest producer of tea and&#13;
the third largest exporter. World tea production is expected to grow at 3.6%&#13;
p.a. in the 1980-95 period, compared with 3.7% p.a. in 1970-80.        Production&#13;
expansion in sub-Sahara is expected to steadily slow down to 3.2% p.a. by&#13;
1990-95.&#13;
World consumption should grow at a slightly faster rate in 1980-95&#13;
(3.2% p.a.) than in 1961-80 (2.8% p.a.). However, it is expected to increase&#13;
by only 2.7% p.a. between 1980 and 1985, due to slower income growth in the&#13;
developing countries and in the centrally planned economies, both of which&#13;
have been the major sources of recent demand growth.&#13;
Consumption is expected to keep on falling in the traditional tea&#13;
drinking   industrial  countries--the   United   Kingdom,   Australia,  and   New&#13;
Zealand. However, the United States should continue to show modest growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

World trade in tea has been growing by only about 2% a year for 20&#13;
years.    Within this   slow growth, however,   substantial  shifts  in trading&#13;
patterns have taken place.   In 1961 the United Kingdom accounted for over 40%&#13;
of total imports.   With its imports declining since then, its share of world&#13;
imports was only 23% in 1980.     Still, it remains the largest importer, with&#13;
about one-quarter of its imports being re-exported.      The United States, the&#13;
USSR, and Pakistan are the other major importers.      Growth in imports by the&#13;
USSR and Pakistan has been quite rapid.&#13;
India and Sri Lanka have remained the major exporters, despite their&#13;
losses to East Africa in the UK market.    Among the other major tea exporters,&#13;
Kenya, China, and Indonesia have shown the most rapid growth. By 1995 China&#13;
is expected to be the world's largest exporter.&#13;
Producing and consuming countries agreed in 1977 on basic objectives&#13;
for an international tea program which would lead to an international tea&#13;
agreement. However, progress so far has been limited.&#13;

SUGAR&#13;
Sugar prices in 1981 constant dollars dropped from a high of $632/ton&#13;
in 1980 to $220/ton in January-July 1982.     In terms of 1981 constant dollars&#13;
they are likely to average $272/ton     in 1983   and   to reach    $372/ton  in&#13;
1985-95.   They are expected to average at that level for the following ten&#13;
years.   These prices would be higher than, say, those experienced in the&#13;
1960s.&#13;
More than   50% of   world sugar trade is conducted under government-&#13;
to-government contracts or on a multilateral basis. Major government-&#13;
to-government long-term sales contrcts exist between the USSR and Cuba,&#13;
between  Japan  and  Australia,   and  between  Japan  and  Brazil.    The  only&#13;
significant multilateral arrangement is the Lome sugar arrangement between ACP&#13;
countries and the EC.     The price under these arrangements thus varies from&#13;
market quotations and has usually tended to be higher than world prices. As a&#13;
result, export unit values often diverge significantly from market prices.&#13;
When prices are relatively high, the ratio of unit value of export to market&#13;
prices tends to fall below unity where when prices are relatively low, the&#13;
ratio rises above unity.&#13;
About 40% of sugar comes from sugar beets produced mostly in Europe&#13;
(Western and Eastern).   Of the 56 million tons of cane sugar produced in the&#13;
developing countries in 1980, over one-half was produced in the Western&#13;
Hemisphere and only 6% in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
As a rule beet sugar cannot compete with cane sugar without&#13;
protection.   Cane yields averaged 56.5 tons per hectare in 1978-80.        This&#13;
implies 5.65 tons of raw sugar (or a little over five tons of refined sugar)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
per hectare.   Average beet yields were 31 tons per hectare in 1978-80.     This&#13;
represents 4.5 tons of raw sugar equivalent (or a little over 4 tons of&#13;
refined sugar) per hectare.     Also, beet sugar factories have lower annual&#13;
capacities than cane sugar factories since the beet harvesting season is&#13;
shorter than the cane harvesting season.&#13;
Sugar production in industrial countries is generally heavily&#13;
protected; typically it is not protected in the major developing-country&#13;
producers.   It is estimated that the costs of production per pound of sugar&#13;
(raw equivalent) in 1978 were around 150 in the US, 170 in the EC, and more&#13;
than 20q in the USSR and Eastern Europe.       This compares to a world market&#13;
price of 80 and an export unit value from developing countries of 100 in&#13;
1978.    Production  costs  are  estimated  at between   10Q  and  14Q for most&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
In industrial countries per capita consumption has approached virtual&#13;
saturation at between 45 and 55 kilograms.       The elasticity of per capita&#13;
demand with respect to per capita income is close to zero. It is about 0.4 in&#13;
the centrally planned economies in Europe.     The income elasticities are much&#13;
higher in developing countries. They are around unity for countries with low&#13;
consumption levels (mostly in Asia and Africa, where less than ten kilograms&#13;
per capita is consumed in many countries) and around 0.7 for countries with&#13;
higher consumption levels (30 to 40 kilograms per capita in most Latin&#13;
American countries).&#13;
The market outlook for sugar is dominated by the sugar cycle. Apart&#13;
from its short-term price response, sugar production responds to prices with a&#13;
lag  of  two  to  three  years.    Thus   production  growth  should  slow  down&#13;
considerably in the years immediately ahead in response to current low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

prices.   Prices will increase once stocks start to decline, and could rise&#13;
sharply should there be a crop loss in a major producing country.            The&#13;
resulting high prices typically cause producers to over-respond, so that&#13;
prices slump two to four years later.&#13;
In 1980 trade amounted to some 21 million tons, or 22% of&#13;
production.   The share of production that enters world trade has been slowly&#13;
declining over the past 20 years.    Industrial-country policies were the main&#13;
reason.   In these countries production increased at about 3% per year but&#13;
consumption increased at only about 2% p.a. so net import requirements&#13;
decreased.&#13;
Of gross exports, half came from the developing countries.       For a&#13;
long time the Philippines was the largest developing-country exporter but it&#13;
was recently overtaken by Brazil, which now accounts for over 8% of world&#13;
exports.   The share of sub-Saharan countries has remained small - 5-6% of&#13;
world exports.    The industrial countries account for one quarter of world&#13;
exports; Australia alone accounts for 10%.    Cuba exports about one quarter of&#13;
the world total.&#13;
Over half of total world imports are absorbed by the industrial&#13;
countries, with the United States and Japan accounting for about 20% and 12%&#13;
of the world total respectively; 20% go to the centrally planned economies;&#13;
and 20% to 25% go to the developing countries, primarily in Asia and Africa.&#13;
The EC is attempting to limit its production of sugar such that the&#13;
quantity in excess of domestic needs will not increase as rapidly as in the&#13;
past. This process should continue through the 1980s, lowering the growth of&#13;
exports from over 10% p.a. in the 1970s to approximately 4% p.a. in the&#13;
1980s.   In Japan no major policy changes are foreseen so its imports should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

grow at about the same rate as domestic consumption. In the United States the&#13;
"Carribean Initiative," whereby certain quantities of sugar from that region&#13;
are allowed to enter duty free, will not alter global trade because country&#13;
quotas, no larger than recent trade, are specified.&#13;
International   Sugar   Agreements    (ISA)   have   been   in   effect&#13;
intermittently since 1954.    The present Agreement expires in December 1982.&#13;
Participation has become more comprehensive; most large importers, including&#13;
the United States, have become members. An important exception is the EC.&#13;
The ISA has not worked as effectively because it does not have&#13;
sufficient power to reduce production in member countries, and its stocks are&#13;
too small to dampen price variations.&#13;

BEEF&#13;
Beef prices are expected to rise steadily in constant 1981 dollars&#13;
from an estimated 231Â¢/kg in 1982 to 2560/kg in 1985.        They are likely to&#13;
experience cyclical decline in 1990, and then increase to 2600/kg in 1995.&#13;
Thus, real prices in 1980-95 are likely to be significantly lower than their&#13;
average levels in the 1960s and 1970s but above the prices in 1975-79.      Beef&#13;
prices will continue to exhibit marked cyclical behavior, due to the cyclical&#13;
nature of production.&#13;
Over the longer term, beef and veal consumption is expected to grow&#13;
more slowly than in the past 20 years.     In the industrial countries, slower&#13;
population growth,   lower per   capita income   growth,  and declining   income&#13;
elasticities for meat will contribute to this slowdown.        Lower per capita&#13;
income growth and much slower growth in beef production than in the past will&#13;
lead to much lower consumption and production growth in the centrally planned&#13;
economies.&#13;
Trade in beef and veal is heavily dominated by the industrial&#13;
countries.   However, most of this trade is carried on within the EC.        The&#13;
residual is very much constrained by trade barriers.    Imports into the United&#13;
States and Japan are constrained by quotas.      EC imports from third-country&#13;
exporters are even more highly constrained, primarily by minimum prices,&#13;
enforced by a system of variable levies. In practice, the bulk of the imports&#13;
enter under quotas partially or entirely exempt from the levies.      Under Lome&#13;
II, for example, Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Swaziland, and now Zimbabwe have&#13;
an annual quota.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The USSR has provided one of the largest and fastest growing markets&#13;
for beef from developing countries.    It has been of particular importance for&#13;
Argentina since Argentina lost most of its export market in the EC.          This&#13;
market is expected to grow at about 5% p.a. over the long term as should the&#13;
total of other centrally planned economies' imports.&#13;
The developing countries also provide scope for growth in trade.&#13;
Important among them should be the high-income countries of South East Asia&#13;
and the Middle East.   Egypt, for example, is emerging as an important importer&#13;
of Argentina's beef.&#13;
In summary, leaving aside trade within the EC, world imports are&#13;
expected to increase by 4.6% p.a. in the period 1980-95.       Exports -from Sub-&#13;
Saharan countries (Zimbabwe, Botswana) are relatively small - they fell&#13;
sharply in 1980 (to 40,000 tons) but are expected to recover by 1990 to their&#13;
1975 level of 86,000 tons.&#13;

BANANAS&#13;
Banana prices in real terms have shown a long-term downward trend.&#13;
This trend is expected to continue in the projection period. Banana prices in&#13;
1981 constant dollars in the past successive decades averaged 62Â¢/kg in the&#13;
1950s, 539 in the 1960s, and 39q in the 1970s.     They are expected to decline&#13;
to 359/kg in 1985, 33e/kg in 1990, and 309/kg in 1995.      Banana prices depend&#13;
mainly on the changes in production costs which have been declining in&#13;
constant dollar terms as a result of increased yield per hectare.&#13;
There is no established world market for determination of banana&#13;
prices. They differ from location to location. However, the long term trend&#13;
in banana prices is needed, the free on rail (FOR) price of bananas imported&#13;
into the United States is the best indicator. FAO estimated that in 1979 only&#13;
about one-quarter of the FOR price of bananas went to the farmer. 1/          The&#13;
other three-quarters was split among packing, inland transportation, export&#13;
tax, and exporter's margin (30%); freight and insurance (34%); and unloading&#13;
and importer's margin (11%).&#13;
In 1980, the industrial countries accounted for 84% of world&#13;
imports. The United States is the largest single importer (36%), followed by&#13;
the EC (28%), and Japan (11%).    The centrally planned economies accounted for&#13;
4%, and the developing countries 12% of world imports.&#13;
World trade in bananas is expected to grow by about 2.2% p.a. between&#13;
1980 and 1995, as compared to 4.8% p.a. in the 1960s and 1.6% p.a. in the&#13;
1970s. While growth in imports by industrial countries will be slow, imports&#13;

by the USSR, Eastern Europe, and North Africa and the Middle East are expected&#13;
to grow rapidly. Correspondingly, exports from those producing countries that&#13;
depend wholly on industrial-country markets are expected to grow rather&#13;
slowly, while countries that have been able to diversify their export outlets&#13;
will be able to expand their exports at a faster rate.&#13;
Income elasticities of demand for bananas for major importing&#13;
countries  in  recent  years  have   generally  been  low.    According  to  FAO&#13;
estimates, income elasticities are 0.08 for the United States, 0.06 for&#13;
France, 0.14 for the Netherlands, 0.72 for Switzerland, and negative for the&#13;
United Kingdom and West Germany.    Higher income elasticities for countries at&#13;
lower per capita consumption levels have been estimated (e.g., 1.29 for&#13;
Japan). According to the FAO, price elasticities of demand range from -0.1 to&#13;
-0.6 for the major banana importing countries. 1/&#13;
World banana trade appears to follow a pattern which is dictated by&#13;
the existence of preferential arrangements, the perishability of the fruit,&#13;
and transportation costs.     The EC-associated countries, such as the Ivory&#13;
Coast and Cameroon, export to France; and Somalia exports to Italy.        These&#13;
preferential arrangements generally take the form of quota arrangements. The&#13;
share of sub-Saharan countries in world exports is comparatively small (4% in&#13;
1980) and has been declining.&#13;
World banana imports are expected to increase at an average annual&#13;
rate of growth of 2.2% between 1980 and 1995.     The biggest growth in imports&#13;
is expected in the Middle East and North Africa.       These markets have been&#13;
growing very quickly and are expected to continue to do so, although at a&#13;

slower rate because the per capita consumption is already high. Other fast&#13;
growing markets are expected to be the USSR and Eastern Europe.      Their share&#13;
in world imports of bananas should increase from 4% in 1980 to 6% in 1995.&#13;
One of the well-known aspects of the world banana economy is the&#13;
large role played by transnational companies in production and marketing. The&#13;
three major transnational companies are United Brands, Standard Fruit, and Del&#13;
Monte. They controlled 63% of the world banana market in 1980. They dominate&#13;
the market both as major exporters and major importers. These companies own&#13;
plantations, they provide financial and technical assistance to their&#13;
associate producers, and engage in packaging and shipping.     These vertically&#13;
integrated operations ensure the efficient handling of bananas from producing&#13;
countries to consumer markets within the stringent time constraint imposed by&#13;
the perishability of the fruit.&#13;

FRESH CITRUS FRUITS 1/&#13;
The average price of oranges in 1981 constant dollars is forecast to&#13;
show only a marginal change during the next 10-15 years from 38Â¢/kg in 1980 to&#13;
about 360/kg by 1995.&#13;
Production and consumption of fresh citrus fruits are projected to&#13;
grow at 2.8% p.a. in 1980-95, as compared to 5.4% in the 1960s and 3.8% in the&#13;
1970s.   The lower growth in consumption is largely because growth in income&#13;
and population is expected to be slower.        Only about 12% of fresh citrus&#13;
production entered international trade in 1980.     Exports are forecast to grow&#13;
at 2.8% p.a. in 1980-95, as compared to 4.8% in the 1960s and 2.7% in the&#13;
1970s. A large expansion of exports from Cuba would be most responsible for&#13;
this sustained growth.&#13;
Sub-Sahara represents barely 2% of world output. Imports and exports&#13;
of this region are negligible.&#13;
1/   Citrus fruits, as used here, comprise oranges and tangerines, lemons and&#13;
limes, and other citrus fruits (mainly grapefruit).&#13;

RICE&#13;
Rice prices, in constant 1981 dollars, are at a historic low,&#13;
estimated at $313/ton for 1982 and $338/ton for 1983. Prices should continue&#13;
to recover from these low levels.    The 1985-90 and 1995 prices for rice (Thai&#13;
5% broken, FOB Bangkok) in 1981 constant dollars are forecast at $425/ton and&#13;
$418/ton, respectively. These prices would still be lower than the over&#13;
$500/ton of the 1960s and 1970s.&#13;
World rice production grew at 2.7% p.a. in 1961-80 but it expanded at&#13;
3% p.a. in the developing countries, as also in sub-Sahara.        However, sub-&#13;
Saharan countries   produce  only 4 million    tons a year or 1.5% of world&#13;
output.  Production expansion is expected to continue at the historic rates.&#13;
In sub-Saharan Africa, as in many other parts of the world, rice is a&#13;
"preferred" grain.   Consumption of rice in African countries, while small in&#13;
total compared to Asian countries, is growing at a very rapid rate, much of&#13;
the rice coming from increased imports. While annual growth rates of imports&#13;
may be acceptable for countries such as Nigeria which have oil revenues to pay&#13;
for it, they are a matter of concern for other countries.&#13;
The international market for rice is characterized by extreme&#13;
instability. This instability stems from two main factors. First, 90% of the&#13;
world's rice is grown in Asia, where the timeliness and duration of monsoon&#13;
conditions affect production.     Second, some 95% of production is consumed&#13;
domestically, so the small residual which enters world trade is highly&#13;
susceptible to fluctuations.     Thus, when tradable supplies decreased by 3%&#13;
between April 1971 and April 1974, export prices in constant dollars increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
sixfold. Such instability indicates a need to strengthen the production base&#13;
in the main rice-consuming countries, in part by further irrigation.&#13;
The market structure of the rice trade is unique in two respects.&#13;
First, a high proportion of sales from industrial to developing countries is&#13;
on concessionary or subsidized terms (as high as 40% in 1978).      Second, many&#13;
sales  are made   by government-to-government   contracts  rather  than through&#13;
commercial channels.   This leaves only a small portion of the international&#13;
rice market to commercial traders; such trading is dominated by the few large&#13;
international grain companies and by middlemen operating out of Bangkok and&#13;
Hong Kong.&#13;

GRAINS (WHEAT AND COARSE GRAINS) 1/&#13;
Wheat&#13;
In 1981 constant dollars, wheat price (Canadian No. 1) in 1990-95 is&#13;
projected at $190/ton.    The price would be higher than that in the 1980s but&#13;
below its average level in the 1960s and 1970s.&#13;
Consumption and production of wheat is projected to grow by 3.1% p.a.&#13;
from 1980-95, slightly slower than the long-term historical growth rate of&#13;
3.4%.   Wheat consumption is increasing most rapidly in developing countries&#13;
(4.9% per year over 1970-80) and is projected to increase at 4.4% over the&#13;
next decade.   Within this group of countries, consumption in China and Africa&#13;
should grow at the most rapid rate (6.5% and 5%, respectively).       Most other&#13;
developing  countries   are  increasing  consumption  at  around   3% p.a.     In&#13;
centrally planned economies, past and future wheat consumption is growing at&#13;
1.7% p.a. while growth in industrial countries should slow to approximately&#13;
1.6% p.a.&#13;
Wheat imports by sub-Saharan countries grew rapidly in 1961-80 (12%&#13;
p.a.).   In spite of a projected slow down in the rate of increase in imports,&#13;
much of the increase in wheat consumption in sub-Sahara will be supplied by&#13;
imports.&#13;
1/   Coarse grains here include corn, barley, oats, rye, grain sorghum and&#13;
millet.&#13;
Note: Calendar years are used throughout.     When harvesting occurs across two&#13;
years these date are allocated to the year in which the bulk of the harvest&#13;
takes place.&#13;

Coarse Grains&#13;
In 1981 constant dollars, maize price in 1990-95 is projected at&#13;
$134/ton. The price would be higher than in the 1980s, but below the average&#13;
level of the 1960s and 1970s.     Sorghums and other coarse grains are expected&#13;
to follow the same price behavior.&#13;
Consumption of coarse grains is expected to grow at 2.4% p.a.,&#13;
approximately the same as over the last decade.        The projected production&#13;
growth of 2.5% p.a. is marginally higher than that of the 1970s.&#13;
Consumption of coarse grains is increasing most rapidly in developing&#13;
countries.    In  the newly   industrializing  countries   and in oil-exporting&#13;
nations where coarse grains are used as the feed-input for the livestock and&#13;
poultry industries, consumption has been growing at double-digit rates.        On&#13;
the other hand, in the sub-Saharan countries where coarse grains are used as&#13;
food, consumption growth rates are slow.&#13;

FATS AND OILS&#13;
Oils can be divided into 3 groups on the basis of average price:&#13;
groundnut, cottonseed, and lauric oils (coconut and palm kernel oil) are the&#13;
highest priced; soybean, palm, sunflowerseed, and rapeseed oils are medium-&#13;
priced; and marine or fish oils are the cheapest. A similar classification of&#13;
high protein meals indicates that most oilseed meal prices are generally lower&#13;
in price than soybean meal.&#13;
Prices for most fats and oils and meals are expected to increase from&#13;
their 1980 level during the period up to 1990 and then decline slightly. Two&#13;
key factors which determine the long-term market prospects are the demand for&#13;
high-protein meals, and the expansion of oil supplies from tree crops, mainly&#13;
oil palm and coconuts.      Oil palm and,   to a lesser extent, coconut will&#13;
continue to provide attractive investment opportunities in the tree crops&#13;
sector.&#13;
Since the early 1960s, soybean production has grown at about 6%&#13;
p.a.   Most of this expansion has taken place in the United States and, more&#13;
recently, in Brazil and Argentina as well.     In sub-Sahara, only Nigeria has&#13;
been able to create a sizeable production base.&#13;
In 1965, 73% of world palm oil output was produced in Africa, 23% in&#13;
Asia, and 3% in Latin America.    By 1980 almost 68% was produced in Asia, 27%&#13;
in Africa, and 4% in Latin America.     The main factor behind this change has&#13;
been the dramatic increase in Malaysian production which has increased at over&#13;
20% p.a. since 1961, and now accounts for more than 60% of world exports.&#13;
Within Africa, Nigeria continues to be the biggest producer, but the&#13;
African country most successful in increasing output has been the Ivory&#13;
&#13;

Coast. Elsewhere protection has not kept pace with demand so that sub-Sahara&#13;
has changed from a dominant exporter two years earlier to a net importer of&#13;
palm oil.&#13;
Worldwide, the apparent consumption of fats and oils grew 3.7% p.a.&#13;
from 1961 to 1980. World consumption of vegetable oils is expected to grow at&#13;
about 3.3% p.a. over the next 15 years, i.e., slightly below the 3.7% p.a. of&#13;
1961-80.  Demand is expected to grow fastest in developing countries, as also&#13;
in sub-Sahara.    World consumption of oilseed meals is projected to grow at&#13;
about 4.3% p.a. between 1980-95, only slightly lower than the rate of 4.5%&#13;
between 1961-80.&#13;
Demand for soft vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil, cottonseed oil,&#13;
and corn oil) can be expected to grow faster than demand for hard oils (e.g.,&#13;
coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and palm oil), while increasing supplies of hard&#13;
oils will find a market only at larger and larger price discounts.&#13;
Trade in fats and oils and in meals is expected to continue to follow&#13;
production trends.    Exports of fats and oils and of meals are projected to&#13;
increase at 3.7% and 4.9% p.a., respectively, in 1980-95. Industrial countries&#13;
are expected to continue to dominate meal imports and developing countries are&#13;
expected to continue to dominate imports of fats and oils.&#13;
Effective demand for vegetable protein, in the form of oilmeals, has&#13;
grown at a faster rate than the demand for fats and oils. The oilmeal sector&#13;
of the market now leads the world oilseed economy, which accounts for the&#13;
growing market preference for oilseeds with a high meal and low oil content.&#13;
Soybeans have benefitted most from this trend, as they yield 78-80% meal and&#13;
18% oil, in contrast to products such as copra, which yields only 35% meal and&#13;
64% oil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A unique feature of the fats and oils market is that supplies come&#13;
both from annual crops, such as soybeans and groundnuts, and from perennial&#13;
tree crops, such as oil palm and coconuts.     Producers of annual oilseed crops&#13;
can adjust their production quickly (for most crops, within a year) to changes&#13;
in the market prospects; producers of tree crops cannot.       Investment in oil&#13;
palm, or coconut trees is based on longer term price expectations so it is&#13;
generally more risky than investment in annual crops.       Once the trees have&#13;
been planted, producers usually have no choice but to harvest.        Crops left&#13;
unharvested become a source of diseases which endanger the life of the trees&#13;
and  thus  future  harvests.    The   supply  of oils   from  tree  crops  tends,&#13;
therefore, to be more stable than that of annual crops.&#13;
Fats and oils and oilmeals enter international markets in two&#13;
forms:   unprocessed   (e.g.,  oilseeds) or processed   (e.g.,  oil/meal).    The&#13;
proportion of oilseed to oil or meal exports varies widely among fats and oils&#13;
and over time.     These different proportions    largely reflect the relative&#13;
profitability of oilseed processing (oil extraction) in producing and&#13;
importing countries.   Freight rates and tariffs favor trade in oilseeds over&#13;
trade in fats and oils. The bulk of soybean oil exports enters international&#13;
trade in the form of unprocessed beans, mainly because importing countries&#13;
protect their oilseed processing industry through tariffs on vegetable oils&#13;
whereas oilseeds can usually be imported duty-free.        Industrial countries,&#13;
particularly the EC countries, import the bulk of the world's supplies of&#13;
soybeans and meal, while developing countries import mainly soybean oil.       In&#13;
recent years, oilseed exporting countries have begun to set up their own&#13;
processing facilities or to expand existing ones.      The Philippines, the main&#13;
coconut-producing country, now exports mainly coconut oil instead of copra.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
Malaysia, the principal palm oil producer and exporter, exports refined rather&#13;
than crude palm oil, with more than 90% of its palm oil exports being refined&#13;
oil.&#13;
Production of fats and oils is projected to grow at an average annual&#13;
rate of 3.2% in 1980-95, below the rate of 3.8% in 1961-80.       In view of the&#13;
projected strong demand for livestock products, a major portion of the oil&#13;
supply will come from oilseeds, particularly soybeans, crushed for meal.&#13;
Single-cell protein (SCP) has not made much headway and it appears unlikely&#13;
that SCP will affect these markets before 1990, unless its price drops&#13;
significantly.&#13;
Since most fats and oils (meals) are interchangeable, their markets&#13;
are closely linked together.    The extent to which the price of an oil (meal)&#13;
moves with the overall price level for all fats and oils (meals) depends on&#13;
the ease with which it can be replaced by other oils (meals).&#13;

COTTON&#13;
Cotton prices (Mexican middling) in constant 1981 dollars - at&#13;
187Â¢/kg in 1981 - are projected to be 1630/kg in 1982, 186Â¢/kg in 1983, and&#13;
200Â¢/kg in 1985. They should rise to 215C/kg in 1990 and remain at that level&#13;
in 1995. The price projections are expected to attract the acreage to cotton&#13;
growing necessary to meet projected demand.&#13;
Prospects for income and population growth indicate that the outlook&#13;
for  fiber  consumption   is  still  quite   favorable,  particularly     in  the&#13;
developing countries.    Economic and climatic conditions in many developing&#13;
countries also favor expanded cotton manufacturing.     Demand growth for cotton&#13;
in the centrally planned economies slowed sharply in the 1970s due to&#13;
increasing domestic supplies of man-made fibers; this modest growth in cotton&#13;
use is likely to continue in the future. Mill consumption in the industrial&#13;
countries is projected to continue to decline, but at a more moderate rate, in&#13;
the face of competition from synthetic fibers and imported textiles.        On a&#13;
world basis, mill consumption of cotton is projected to increase at 1.9% p.a.&#13;
to 1995.&#13;
World cotton production during 1978-80 was one-third greater than&#13;
during 1961-63, due to improved yields (increasing on average by 1.8% a year).&#13;
Global mill consumption of cotton increased at 1.8% p.a. since&#13;
1960.   At 4.0% per year, the expansion was most rapid in the developing&#13;
countries.   In Africa, textile manufacturing - although relatively new - is&#13;
now commonplace in most countries;     African mill use of cotton increased at&#13;
6.4% per year. Cotton consumption in the Asian developing countries increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
at 4.0% per year, boosting their share of world consumption to 43% in 1980;&#13;
the volume leader in this expansion was China.&#13;
Past substitution of synthetic fibers for cotton was favored by the&#13;
declining cost of synthetics relative to cotton; now the price ratio is likely&#13;
to move in favor of cotton, once the current over-capacity in the synthetic&#13;
fiber industry is fully utilized and new costlier investment in production&#13;
capacities becomes necessary (around the mid-1980s).&#13;
Cotton exports from the developing countries declined in 1960-80.&#13;
This was associated mainly with the relatively rapid expansion of cotton&#13;
manufacturing in many cotton-producing countries.       By 1980 the exportable&#13;
supply of cotton was virtually eliminated in Brazil and substantially reduced&#13;
in Egypt, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Syria, and several Sub-Saharan countries.&#13;
Increased domestic processing in cotton-producing countries also reduced their&#13;
demand for textiles from industrial countries, thus reducing the latter's raw&#13;
cotton imports.&#13;
In the 1970s many developing countries sharply increased their&#13;
earnings from cotton textile exports.      The most rapid increases in cotton&#13;
textile exports, however, came from the cotton importers in the Asia/Pacific&#13;
region. Conditions favoring expanded textile manufacturing clearly seem to be&#13;
best met in the developing countries, particularly those in Asia.         Cotton&#13;
manufacturing is a relatively new experience in many African countries, but&#13;
the projected growth from their present level is higher than that for most&#13;
other regions.&#13;
Cotton manufacturing expanded faster than cotton growing in producing&#13;
developing countries during the 1970s and their export growth was negative (-&#13;
2.8% p.a.).   In sub-Sahara, both production and exports expanded at a rather&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
modest rate - about 1% p.a. in the 1970s. The added attention now being given&#13;
to cotton production projects could lead to a slight rise in export&#13;
availabilities.&#13;
U.S cotton growers, under less restrictive policies since the early&#13;
1970s, have become very responsive to demand for cotton in export markets as&#13;
domestic mill consumption declined. Exports from the USSR have also increased&#13;
steadily as production outpaced domestic requirements.&#13;
Price stabilization measures, particularly a buffer stock scheme,&#13;
have been under international consideration within the framework of the UNCTAD&#13;
Integrated Program for Commodities since 1977.       The diverse interests of&#13;
cotton producers, consumers, importers, and exporters of both fibers and&#13;
manufactures have made it extremely difficult to formulate acceptable specific&#13;
provisions for an international agreement.&#13;

SISAL&#13;
Sisal 1/ is a hard fiber extracted from the leaf of a cactus-like&#13;
plant.   Its main commercial use is in the manufacture of cordage products,&#13;
particularly agricultural harvest twine for baling hay and straw.         As its&#13;
primary use is related to forage production for the livestock industry,&#13;
consumption is centered in the industrial countries.    Production, however, is&#13;
concentrated in the semi-arid regions of East and Southern Africa, in Mexico's&#13;
Yucatan Peninsula, and in Northeast Brazil.&#13;
In response to weakening demand, world production of sisal declined&#13;
in 1961-80 by 2.2% p.a. - from an average of 651,300 tons in 1961-63 to an&#13;
average of 477,100 tons in 1978-80.       The downtrend was severe in Africa.&#13;
Tanzania, the worlds largest producer, experienced a sharp decline, from an&#13;
average of 212,100 tons in 1961-63 to one of 98,200 tons in 1978-80.      During&#13;
the same period output decreased in other African countries - Kenya,&#13;
Madagascar, Mozambique, Angola - as well.     Henequen production experienced a&#13;
similar decline in Mexico. In contrast, sisal production in Brazil increased&#13;
rapidly from 170,100 tons in 1961-63 to 241,300 tons 1978-80 under government&#13;
policies that supported prices to growers and periodically diverted excess&#13;
stocks to the paper making industry.&#13;
Since the mid-1960s, two major developments have seriously eroded the&#13;
market  for   sisal  products.    First,labor  saving   machinery  and  handling&#13;
procedures have encouraged a shift from hay-making to silage preservation of&#13;

forage; moreover, the newer hay baling machinery produces larger and higher&#13;
density bales, requiring less twine per ton of hay than conventional balers.&#13;
Second, the development of polypropylene cordage products, among them&#13;
synthetic agricultural twines, has sharply cut into the sisal twine market in&#13;
the EC and North America.      The average annual export of sisal fiber and&#13;
manufactures has been declining.      Even with cost trends expected to favor&#13;
sisal compared to polypropylene, trends in fodder preservation and baling&#13;
technology would prevent sisal twine demand from rising above its 1977-79&#13;
level. This suggests that sisal does not present the producing countries with&#13;
a viable opportunity for increasing their export earnings.&#13;

The price of RSS 1 spot New York in 1981 constant dollars is&#13;
projected to increase from 125Â¢/kg in 1981 to 134Â¢/kg in 1985, and to 161Â¢/kg&#13;
in 1995. Thus, by 1985 the price of NR (natural rubber) in constant dollars&#13;
should return to its 1977-79 level and then gain another 20% in the next ten&#13;
years.&#13;
World elastomer (natural and synthetic rubber) consumption growth,&#13;
which slowed down from about 6% p.a. in the 1950s to 3.7% p.a. in the 1970s&#13;
(largely because of the dampening effects of the petroleum price increases on&#13;
the growth of demand for automotive uses), is expected to be 3.5% p.a. until&#13;
the mid-1980s. World demand is projected to grow at well above 4% p.a. in the&#13;
1985-95 period.&#13;
World consumption of NR expanded at a healthy 3% p.a. in the 1970s,&#13;
reflecting increased availabilities and improved price competitiveness with&#13;
synthetic rubbers (SRs).    The development and rapid diffusion of radial tire&#13;
technology helped increase consumption in industrial countries, but the&#13;
increase was   even faster in developing     countries.    In centrally planned&#13;
economies, rigid policies of import substitution severely constrained the use&#13;
of NR.&#13;
Demand for NR is projected to increase by 3.4% p.a. in 1980-85, 4.1%&#13;
in 1985-90, and 3.9% in 1990-95.     In developing countries, a growth rate of&#13;
5.2% is projected between 1980-95.&#13;
Imports of NR by industrial countries are projected to grow much&#13;
faster in the 1980s than in the 1950s and 1960s.     NR imports are expected to&#13;
grow more slowly in developing countries, where some expansion of SR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

production capacities has taken place and additional expansion is expected,&#13;
particularly  in oil abundant    countries.    Growth of imports   by centrally&#13;
planned economies is projected to decline also, as a consequence of the large&#13;
expansion of their SR production capacities.&#13;
Production of NR is concentrated in a few developing countries.&#13;
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand account for over 80%.       In sub-Sahara, the&#13;
main producers include Liberia, and Nigeria and to a lesser extent Zaire,&#13;
Cameroon and the Ivory Coast.     Production in this region grew slowly in the&#13;
1960s and actually declined in the 1970s.     The share of sub-Sahara in world&#13;
exports declined from 7% in the 1960s to 4% in 1980.           The fall in the&#13;
quantities exported as well as sub-Sahara's share is expected to continue.&#13;
The major NR producing and consuming countries, after two years of&#13;
negotiations, reached an International Natural Rubber Agreement in 1979. The&#13;
main   objective  of   the  Agreement   is  to   stabilize  conditions   in  the&#13;
international natural rubber trade by avoiding excessive price fluctuations.&#13;
The Agreement came into provisional force in October 1980. For it to&#13;
come into force definitively, at least 80% of net exporters and net importers&#13;
must ratify the Agreement.    The Agreement entered definitively into force on&#13;
April 15, 1982.&#13;

The price of Indian flue-cured leaf in 1981 constant dollars is&#13;
projected to be about $2,100/ton in 1985-95, compared to $2,050/ton in 1981.&#13;
Thus, prices would be somewhat lower but not much different than those in the&#13;
1970s.&#13;
On the basis of recent consumption patterns and expected world&#13;
population and income growth rates, tobacco consumption is expected to reach&#13;
6.8 million tons in 1990 and 7.7 million tons in 1995, implying a growth of&#13;
2.3%  p.a.    Since  1972 world   production has   been  experiencing   a mildly&#13;
expansionary trend.    In 1980-95, production and consumption are expected to&#13;
grow at about 3.0% p.a. in developing countries, a slightly higher rate than&#13;
in the recent past. Projected production and consumption growth in industrial&#13;
countries is slow and falling.     In centrally planned economies the historic&#13;
rate of growth in production and consumption of 1.3% p.a. should continue over&#13;
the next decade.&#13;
Anti-smoking health campaigns continue to have a moderating impact on&#13;
the level of consumption and exert a strong influence over smoking habits,&#13;
namely, the growing preference for mild tobaccos with low tar-nicotine&#13;
content.    To   date,  however,  substitutes   have  failed  to  gain   consumer&#13;
acceptance.&#13;
Trade should grow at a slightly faster rate up from a growth rate of&#13;
2.9% p.a. in the 1970s to about 3.2% p.a. in the 1980s.       Most of the growth&#13;
will be within developing countries, where the export growth rate is projected&#13;
at 4.3% p.a. and the import growth rate is projected at 4.0% p.a.&#13;
&#13;

There are three main types of tobacco.    Flue tobacco maintains about&#13;
42% share of total production.     Burley tobacco holds an 11% share of total&#13;
world tobacco production; the United States is the major producer, with a 45%&#13;
share.   It is a high quality tobacco with a mild flavor and low nicotine&#13;
levels. Other major producers are Brazil and the Philippines, but production&#13;
in Malawi and Zimbabwe is growing the most rapidly. Burley tobacco is used as&#13;
a filler   in cigarettes.     Oriental  leaf accounts   for  15% of total   leaf&#13;
production; it is grown primarily in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions.&#13;
Reflecting changing consumer tastes, one of the most significant&#13;
developments in tobacco production in recent years has been the shift from&#13;
dark to light tobaccos.   This trend is expected to continue, confining future&#13;
tncreases in production primarily to flue-cured and burley leaf.&#13;
The storing of tobacco is part of the production process.      It takes&#13;
up to three years to age but is storeable without loss of quality for ten&#13;
years.   For quality control purposes, manufacturers need to hold stocks from&#13;
at least two harvests.    For these reasons tobacco stocks are proportionately&#13;
larger than for other agricultural products.     The United States, the United&#13;
Kingdom, and Canada typically hold stocks equivalent to one year of world&#13;
consumption.&#13;
Tobacco is an attractive cash crop for the sub-Saharan countries. It&#13;
is one of the few agricultural commodities for which their share of world&#13;
trade has   increased  in recent years.     Rising labor   costs and   technical&#13;
developments have eroded the industrial countries' traditional competitive&#13;
edge.&#13;
Countries where production is projected to increase most rapidly over&#13;
the next decade, with projected annual growth rates in parentheses, are as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
follows:   Chad    (13%),   Kenya    (10%),   Malawi   (8%),   Tanzania    (12%),&#13;
Zimbabwe (14%), Fiji (17%), and Uruguay (11%). The area of greatest expansion&#13;
of tobacco production is East Africa. Countries where production is projected&#13;
to decrease most rapidly over the next decade, and their projected annual&#13;
rates of contraction, are Pakistan (-0.4%), Haiti (-4%), Puerto Rico (-6%),&#13;
Jordan (-2%), Algeria (-2%), Cuba (-2%) and virtually all the industrial&#13;
countries, ranging from Belgium (-2.8%) to the United States (-0.6%).&#13;
Approximately 90% of leaf tobacco that enters into international&#13;
trade is under the direct or indirect control of six multinational leaf&#13;
buyers.   Most of the seven multinational tobacco manufacturing conglomerates&#13;
own or have an interest in a leaf buying firm. Four buyers accounted for 90%&#13;
of US flue-cured and burley purchases in 1976 and three dealer/processors for&#13;
90 to 95% of Malawian, Zimbabwean, Zambian, and Canadian leaf purchases;&#13;
similarly, 80% of Brazil's exports and 100% of Kenya's leaf tobacco were&#13;
purchased by a single firm.&#13;
A recent trend in the tobacco market is for increased vertical&#13;
integration of tobacco conglomerates.      Production of leaf is the only area&#13;
into which they have not expanded.     The oligopolistic industry structure is&#13;
strengthened by the swapping of trademarks, the production of each others'&#13;
brands in specific markets, and the sharing of production facilities. Prices&#13;
tend to be administered, and competition or threat of competition from new&#13;
entrants is minimized.&#13;
In such an oligopolistic framework, developing countries have little&#13;
control  over marketing   decisions.    Also  processed   exports by developing&#13;
countries are almost non-existent. Moreover, they have little influence over&#13;
prices.   The barriers to entry, active non-price competition among firms,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
informal market sharing arrangements, and cross-subsidization into new product&#13;
lines   characteristic   of   the  tobacco   industry   reinforce   conglomerate&#13;
concentration in the industry.&#13;
Export prices tend to follow US prices.       This occurs because the&#13;
United States is a major tobacco producer, holds a dominant share of world&#13;
trade, (20% of exports and 14% of imports), and is the dominant stockholding&#13;
country. Moreover, the US Government price support program tends to act as a&#13;
floor for export prices received by other countries.&#13;

TROPICAL HARDWOOD&#13;
Tropical hardwood prices have exhibited a distinctive upward secular&#13;
trend over the past decades.      This trend is expected to continue for the&#13;
foreseeable future. In terms of constant 1981 dollars, the sapelli log price&#13;
FOB Comeroon, which is used as the indicator price for West African redwood&#13;
species, is projected to rise to $238/m 3, $251/mr3, and $270/mr3 in 1985, 1990,&#13;
and 1995, respectively.&#13;
It should be noted that because of their heterogeneity, there is no&#13;
organized market that deals with tropical hardwood logs or tropical timber&#13;
products.    Information  regarding   "world  market prices"   is  not  readily&#13;
available; only indicative price quotations for some products in some national&#13;
markets and CIF and FOB prices for some countries are regularly published.&#13;
Furthermore, trade is dominated by a few importing companies.&#13;
Tropical hardwood is one of the most important primary commodities&#13;
for developing countries in terms of export earnings.      Exports of tropical&#13;
hardwood logs and their derived products 1/ from developing countries have&#13;
risen rapidly over the last three decades, amounting to some $5.8 billion in&#13;
1979.    These have risen    sharply  primarily because of the    shortages  of&#13;
temperate hardwood in industrial countries.&#13;
Tropical hardwood comes from the moist forests in tropical regions.&#13;
In sub-Sahara, such forests are concentrated in West and Central Africa&#13;
(mainly Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo,&#13;

Central African Republic, Zaire, and Equatorial Guinea). Other main resource-&#13;
rich regions are Southeast Asia, Tropical Oceania and the Amazon.&#13;
While the tropical hardwood species of these moist tropical forests&#13;
are, theoretically, renewable resources, natural regeneration takes from a&#13;
minimum of 40 years to over 100 years. Large concession forests are "managed"&#13;
on a 25-35 year cycle basis. Plantation growing of preferred species has been&#13;
successful for only a few species in limited locations.&#13;
Recent developments in the tropical hardwood sector in the Asia-&#13;
Pacific region suggest that the structure of tropical hardwood trade in this&#13;
region is changing dramatically, with global implications.      In the last few&#13;
years, three major traditional suppliers, i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and the&#13;
Philippines, which together account for over 80X of world exports of tropical&#13;
hardwood logs, have taken a series of decisive steps to reduce log exports.&#13;
The measures involve export quotas (or outright bans) and/or increased&#13;
government charges (royalties, export taxes) on log exports. Their objectives&#13;
are the following: first of all, to conserve the semi-non-renewable resources&#13;
which had been exploited at a rapidly increasing pace; second, to appropriate&#13;
due levels of resource rent from the rich forest resources which they own;&#13;
and, third, to secure benefits from increased local processing of logs.&#13;
On the supply side, a large number of producers are engaged in&#13;
tropical  hardwood  log  production.    The  effective   number  of independent&#13;
companies engaged in log production in major log-exporting countries, however,&#13;
is substantially less than the number of logging licenses and operations&#13;
suggests, as many companies are engaged in logging operations at more than one&#13;
place and as there are interlocking ownership relationships.     The involvement&#13;
of foreign companies in logging operations is substantial.       In addition to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
outright equity ownership, dependence of local logging firms on foreign firms&#13;
through suppliers' credits for initial purchase of equipment and associated&#13;
marketing arrangements for log output is pervasive.&#13;
During the 1970s, world production of tropical hardwood increased at&#13;
3.6% p.a., markedly down from the 5.6% experienced in the 1960s.         But in&#13;
Africa, among the     traditional    suppliers,   the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and&#13;
Nigeria 1/ have reached the limit of their production potential; their future&#13;
production levels are not likely to be higher than current levels even if&#13;
world market prices increased substantially in real terms. On the other hand,&#13;
Liberia, Cameroon, Gabon, and the Congo have a potential to increase&#13;
production significantly.    In the long term, Angola, Mozambique, Equatorial&#13;
Guinea, and Zaire also have the potential to increase production.&#13;
In Latin America, the resources in the Amazon area are very large.&#13;
However, considering the investment costs and risks involved, for large scale&#13;
production in the Amazon area to be profitable, world market prices need to be&#13;
significantly higher than expected in the next decade or so.&#13;
Tropical hardwood is likely to be in short supply during the next&#13;
fifteen  years.     Limited  additional   exports  can  be  expected   from  the&#13;
established producing areas until the mid-1980s, but if the projected demand&#13;
in 1990 and 1995 is to be satisfied, hitherto unexploited resources will have&#13;
to be opened up on a large scale.    The production costs of supplies from new&#13;
areas--for example the West Irian region of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,&#13;
Amazonia in Brazil, and currently inaccessible areas in Central Africa--would,&#13;
at least initially, be 50-100% higher than those in the traditional supplying&#13;
1/   Nigeria recently became a net importer of timber.&#13;

regions.   Since it takes 25-50 years for most marketable hardwood species to&#13;
grow to minimum size for veneer production (i.e., 50 cm diameter at breast&#13;
height), reforestation measures could have no significant impact on tropical&#13;
hardwood supplies of decorative quality until beyond the turn of the century.&#13;
The income elasticity of demand for logs of all species (coniferous&#13;
and broadleaved) has been estimated at between 0.4 and 0.7.      For broadleaved&#13;
species (tropical as well as temperate), the income elasticity of demand is&#13;
estimated in the range of 0.5 to 0.7, but for those of decorative quality (for&#13;
instance, walnut, oak, teak, rosewood, mahoganies, and "bois rouges" from West&#13;
Africa) demand elasticities are greater than unity. The income elasticity of&#13;
demand has been greater than unity in the case of plywood.&#13;
Given the relatively high income elasticity of demand for logs, the&#13;
demand outlook for tropical hardwood is relatively bright.      However, because&#13;
of supply-side constraints and the resultant rising prices, growth of tropical&#13;
hardwood consumption is likely to be very slow.      It is projected to grow at&#13;
1.4% p.a. in 1980-1995, compared to 3.1% and 6.2% experienced in 1970-1980 and&#13;
1961-1970, respectively.&#13;

Accelerated Development&#13;
in Sub-Saharan Africa:&#13;
An Agenda for Action&#13;
In the fall of 1979, the African Gover-&#13;
nors of the World Bank addressed a&#13;
memorandum to the Bank's president&#13;
expressing their alarm at the dim&#13;
economic prospects for the nations of&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa and asking that&#13;
the Bank prepare a "special paper on&#13;
the economic development problems&#13;
of these countries" and an appropri-&#13;
ate program for helping them. This&#13;
report, building on the Lagos Plan of&#13;
Action, is the response to that&#13;
request.&#13;
The report discusses the factors&#13;
that explain slow economic growth in&#13;
Africa In the recent past, analyzes&#13;
policy changes and program orienta-&#13;
t.ons needed to promote faster&#13;
growth, and concludes with a set of&#13;
recommendations to donors, includ-&#13;
ing the recommendation that aid to&#13;
Africa should double in real terms to&#13;
bring about renewed African develop-&#13;
ment and growth in the 1980s. The&#13;
report's agenda for action is general;&#13;
it indicates broad policy and program&#13;
directions, overall priorities for&#13;
action, and key areas for donor atten-&#13;
tion. Like the Lagos Plan, the report&#13;
recognizes that Africa has enormous&#13;
economic potential, which awaits&#13;
fuller development.&#13;

            Sub-Saharan agriculture : synthesis and
            trade prospects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The rate of growth of agricultural
            production in Sub-Saharan African countries has been
            sluggish during the past two decades. The result has been
            that export growth has been unsatisfactory, food has emerged
            as a difficult problem, and, in many countries, food imports
            have become burdensome and/or the country has become
            dependent on food aid. Agricultural output in these
            countries is the single most important determinant of
            overall economic growth. With the exception of some mineral
            exporting countries, agricultural commodities account for
            two-thirds or more of their export earnings. Composition of
            exports is rigid, and countries are unable to insulate
            themselves against excessive instability in the
            international prices and export demand for primary
            commodities. Projections given in this paper are a broad
            indication of the trends; given the susceptibility of
            commodity prices to sharp fluctuations, the trend values
            should not be read as precise values for individual years.
            Data on individual commodities are included.
