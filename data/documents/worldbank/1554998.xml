EMPIRICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR&#13;
INFANT INDUSTRY PROTECTION&#13;
This paper argues that the empirical evidence does not disprove&#13;
the efficacy of high levels of selective infant industry protection. The&#13;
argument is based on two types of evidence. Recent research on technolo-&#13;
gical change in developing countries provides considerable information about&#13;
the nature of the costs and benefits of infant industry development, together&#13;
with a tentative indication of the magnitude of the costs.    In turn, recently&#13;
completed cross-country comparative research provides some tentative lessons&#13;
about the promotion of infant industries by means of trade policies.&#13;
The research underlying this paper was conducted under the aegis&#13;
of tte "Sources of Industrial Growth and Structural Change" research project,&#13;
which is funded by the Bank's Research Committee (as RPO 671-32) and jointly&#13;
directed by Hollis B. Chenery, Sherman Robinson, Moises Syrquin (consultant),&#13;

Empirical Justification for&#13;
Infant Industry Protection&#13;
Larry E. Westphal&#13;
A number of cross-country comparative research studies on the rela-&#13;
tionship of trade policy to industrialization have been completed over the&#13;
past decade. While there are important differences of detail in the con-&#13;
clusions reached, the various syntheses of this research all agree on one&#13;
central conclusion: greater uniformity of incentives across activities and&#13;
higher levels of export achievement -- individually and in combination -- are&#13;
associated with improved industrial performance as measured by the growth&#13;
of manufacturing output expressed in either domestic or world prices. 1/&#13;
This conclusion is often interpreted in the following terms: though modest&#13;
levels of promotional incentives to infant industries may be in order, the&#13;
closer is the policy regime to free trade, the better is the industrial&#13;
performance, because a free trade regime necessarily means uniformity of&#13;
incentives vis-a-vis trading opportunities and empirically appears to assure&#13;
the requisite high levels of export achievement.&#13;
This is a revision of a paper presented at the International&#13;

The foregoing interpretation admits of the possibility that the&#13;
"optimal" policy regime may depart significantly from free trade in the treat-&#13;
ment of some industries, since it does recognize the possible need for meas-&#13;
ures to promote the development of infant industries. But there has been very&#13;
little empirical research focused on issues directly relevant to the promotion&#13;
of infant industries. To my knowledge, none of the underlying country studies&#13;
[including Westphal and Kim (1977)] traced the evolution of particular infant&#13;
industries over time to see what lessons might be drawn, nor do any of the&#13;
syntheses provide an empirically grounded discussion of appropriate means and&#13;
levels of infant industry promotion. The central question concerning infant&#13;
industry promotion thus remains largely unanswered. The question is, "Under&#13;
different measures which could be used to promote the development of infant&#13;
industries, what are the benefits, what are the costs, and do the former&#13;
exceed the latter?" Obviously, infant industry promotion is warranted only&#13;
if its benefits exceed its costs, and the promotional measure which should be&#13;
used -- if any should -- is that which yields the greatest excess of benefits&#13;
over costs.&#13;
An infant industry is any newly established type of activity for&#13;
which the economy's existing endowment of skills and human capital does not&#13;
provide immediate technological mastery. Technological mastery consists of&#13;
command over technological knowledge as manifested in the ability to use it&#13;
effectively. The costs of infant industry development are thus the costs of&#13;
acquiring technological mastery, while the benefits are those associated with&#13;
the attainment of increased technological mastery. Whether infant industries&#13;
ought to be given promotional incentives turns on whether there would other-&#13;
wise be adequate incentives for the acquisition of increased technological&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
'3 -&#13;
mastery, which in turn depends upon whether individual producers realize all&#13;
of the socially relevant costs and benefits of their own technological effort&#13;
and whether they evaluate costs and benefits in a manner consistent with&#13;
social objectives.&#13;
It is not possible to make a quantitative assessment of the need&#13;
for -- or, more generally, of the merits of -- infant industry promotion&#13;
without empirical evidence concerning costs and benefits. But, even were&#13;
such evidence available, it would not be conclusive. To assess the need for&#13;
promotion requires knowledge of what would happen (or, for an ex post assess-&#13;
ment, of what would have happened) under various alternatives with regard to&#13;
the provision of promotional incentives. Such knowledge comes only in the&#13;
form of predictions which cannot be verified directly, except perhaps in the&#13;
case of that pertaining to the alternative actually followed. In any event,&#13;
since they require the comparison of alternatives, at least one of which is&#13;
counter-factual, estimates of costs and benefits are of uncertain reliability.&#13;
Thus there may always be legitimate disagreement about the need for infant&#13;
industry promotion. But the scope for disagreement is at present magnified&#13;
by the lack of empirical evidence.&#13;
The remainder of this paper reviews the evidence that does exist,&#13;
with the purpose of framing some hypotheses about policies to promote infant&#13;
industries. The evidence with which I will be concerned is of two types.&#13;
First, as a result of recent research on technological change in developing&#13;
countries, there is considerable information about the nature of the costs&#13;
and benefits of infant industry development, together with a tentative indi-&#13;
cation of the magnitude of the costs. Second, the recently completed cross-&#13;
country comparative research gives a basis for stating some tentative lessons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about the promotion of infant industries by means of trade policies. These&#13;
lessons concern both the merits of protecting infant industries from imports&#13;
and the efficacy of fostering infant industry exports. But, before turning&#13;
to these lessons, it is necessary to review what is known about the costs&#13;
and benefits of infant industry development.&#13;
The Nature of Infant Industry Costs and Benefits&#13;
As indicated above, infant industry costs are the costs of acquiring&#13;
technological mastery in newly established activities. The benefits are in-&#13;
creases in the productivity with which the economy-s resources are employed&#13;
as a result of technological changes brought about by applying the newly&#13;
acquired technological mastery. It is often thought that the costs are small,&#13;
on the grounds that infant industries are typically established through&#13;
transfers of production technology from abroad. But the costs of acquiring&#13;
technological mastery include more than the price that is paid for imported&#13;
technology. They also include what is needed in order to assimilate the&#13;
technology.&#13;
The extent of indigenous effort involved in the assimilation of&#13;
technology has only recently begun to be appreciated, as case studies have&#13;
been undertaken of technological changes that have occurred within firms in&#13;
newly established industries. These case studies have shown that "manufac-&#13;
turing technology is characterized by a considerable element of tacitness,&#13;
difficulties in imitation and teaching, and uncertainty regarding what modi-&#13;
fications will work and what will not" [Nelson (1979), p. 18]. That is,&#13;
important elements of the technology appropriate to a particular situation can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
be acquired only through effort to adapt existing technological knowledge to&#13;
that situation. To bring any venture to fruition -- in particular, to estab-&#13;
lish a new production activity -- requires a great deal of iterative problem&#13;
solving and experimentation as the original concept is refined and given&#13;
practical expression, and this sequential process lasts for as long as changes&#13;
continue to be made in the operation of the venture. Research at the firm&#13;
level has demonstrated that this process can continue indefinitely, that it&#13;
is central to the acquisition of technological mastery, and that it produces&#13;
technological changes which greatly increase productivity.&#13;
Dahlman and Fonseca (1978), for example, examined the technological&#13;
history of an integrated Brazilian steel producer whose first plant was estab-&#13;
lished under the equivalent of a turnkey contract. In order to increase the&#13;
plant's production capacity, the firm gradually built up its technological&#13;
mastery through a carefully managed process of selectively importing techni-&#13;
cal assistance where needed to supplement its own engineering efforts. As a&#13;
result, the plant's capacity was more than doubled from its initial nominal&#13;
rating through a sequence of capacity-stretching technological changes which&#13;
took place over seven years. Because these changes required very little&#13;
additional capital investment and no additions to the work force, they more&#13;
than doubled the plant's total factor productivity. Moreover, the acquisi-&#13;
tion of increased technological mastery that was initiated by this process&#13;
eventually enabled the firm to design and execute further additions to its&#13;
capacity and to sell technical assistance to other steel producers, princi-&#13;
pally in Brazil, but elsewhere in Latin America as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
More generally, firms have been found to undertake substantial&#13;
technological effort in order to achieve a wide variety of technological&#13;
changes. 1/ These changes include stretching capacity through various adap-&#13;
tations (as in the example just cited), breaking bottlenecks in particular&#13;
processes, improving the use of by-products, extending the life of equipment,&#13;
making accommodations to changes in raw material sources, and altering the&#13;
product mix. Some of the firms studied appear to have followed explicit&#13;
technological strategies aimed at specific long-term objectives, others seem&#13;
merely to have reacted defensively to changes in their circumstances or to&#13;
obvious needs to adapt imported technology. In turn, some of the firms have&#13;
undertaken no appreciable technological effort and so have experienced no&#13;
technological change. 2/ There have not yet been a sufficient number of case&#13;
studies to generalize about the determinants of the extent and direction of&#13;
technological effort by individual firms, though it is apparent that economic&#13;
forces have an impact, as do characteristics peculiar to individual firms and&#13;
types of technology.&#13;
1/   The largest block of firm-level research has been carried out under the&#13;
auspices of the Regional Program of Studies on Scientific and Technical&#13;
Development in Latin America, jointly sponsored by the Interamerican&#13;
Development Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America,&#13;
the United Nations Development Program, and the International Development&#13;
Research Center in Canada, and under the direction of Jorge Katz. For a&#13;
summary of the first phase of the research, see Katz (1978).&#13;
2/   For an example, and a highly illuminating discussion of why technological&#13;
effort is not automatically or necessarily undertaken, see Bell, et al.&#13;
(1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Most of the technological changes uncovered in this research may&#13;
be characterized as minor, in the sense that they do not create radically new&#13;
technologies but rather adapt existing ones. Nonetheless, as shown by the&#13;
example of the Brazilian steel plant, a sequence of minor technological&#13;
changes can have a pronounced cumulative effect on productivity. In fact,&#13;
judged in terms of their impact on the productivity with which the economyIs&#13;
resources are employed, the cumulative sequence of technological changes which&#13;
has been observed to follow the establishment of a new activity may be more&#13;
important than the initial establishment of the activity. This possibility&#13;
has not -- so far as I know -- been explored, but it is consistent with what&#13;
has been learned about the process of technological change in the industrial-&#13;
ized countries.&#13;
Studies of major technological changes in these countries have&#13;
found it useful to distinguish between what Enos (1962) refers to as the&#13;
alpha and beta stages. The former includes all of the effort leading to&#13;
and including the introduction of a radically new technology. The latter&#13;
covers all of the subsequent minor technological changes undertaken to modify&#13;
and adapt it. In his own analysis of the development and diffusion of six&#13;
new petrochemical processes between 1913 and 1943, Enos found that the cumula-&#13;
tive reduction in production cost per unit achieved during the beta stage was&#13;
greater than the initial reduction obtained in the alpha stage. Studies of&#13;
other major technological changes show them to have followed the same pattern:&#13;
the economic impact of replacing the old technology by the new is generally&#13;
less than the cumulative impact of the gradual improvements made after its&#13;
introduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The assimilation of a new technology imported from abroad is a&#13;
major technological change from the standpoint of a developing economy. The&#13;
initial transfer is parallel to Enos alpha stage. The comparable beta stage&#13;
is the subsequent, gradual improvement in the productivity with which the&#13;
technology is used. But the significance of the beta stage in assimilating a&#13;
technology transfer appears to be far greater than is suggested by the analogy.&#13;
To introduce a radically new technology into the world requires mastery of&#13;
that technology; in contrast, to import a technology does not require complete&#13;
mastery of it, certainly not at the outset. Indeed, the case study research&#13;
suggests that it is in the beta stage that most of the increase in technologi-&#13;
cal mastery is achieved.&#13;
Part of the impact of that increase is reflected in higher produc-&#13;
tivity using the particular technology, but much of the impact spills over&#13;
into related activities. For example, the mastery gained in assimilating one&#13;
technology enables greater indigenous participation in subsequent transfers&#13;
of related technologies, thereby increasing the effectiveness with which they&#13;
are assimilated. In more general terms, increased mastery gained through&#13;
experience with previously introduced technologies contributes to an economyIs&#13;
capacity to undertake independent technological efforts, which may be to&#13;
replicate or adapt foreign technologies or to create new technologies. Further&#13;
evidence of the achievement of technological mastery in a number of semi-&#13;
industrial countries is found in the fact that they are exporting technology&#13;
to other developing countries, and doing so on an increasingly expanded scale&#13;
[Lall (1980)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
To summarize the preceding discussion: A number of firms in&#13;
developing countries have been found to engage in purposive technological&#13;
effort to increase productivity and accommodate changing circumstances, an&#13;
effort which typically takes place in the context of day-to-day operations&#13;
and outside that of formal R &amp; D. Such effort appears to be a primary means&#13;
of acquiring technological mastery and is the principal reflection of its&#13;
acquisition. Moreover, such effort has been found to produce large increases&#13;
in productivity, which translate into substantial reductions in domestic&#13;
resource costs vis-a-vis foreign exchange savings (or earnings). 1/ Judging&#13;
from various case studies in addition to that of the Brazilian steel producer&#13;
which was cited above, it may not be exceptional for the unit domestic resource&#13;
cost of production in a particular type of activity to fall at an annual rate&#13;
of around ten percent during the first five to ten years of production.&#13;
Insofar as the cost of infant industry development is the cost of&#13;
providing experience needed to gain technological mastery, it is reflected&#13;
in reductions over time in the unit domestic resource cost of production.&#13;
In addition to providing valuable insights into how technological mastery is&#13;
achieved in relation to processes of technological change, the research on&#13;
technological change at the firm level in developing countries implies that&#13;
1/   Domestic resource cost per unit of foreign exchange savings (or earnings)&#13;
is the appropriate indicator of changes in productivity. Properly meas-&#13;
ured, it incorporates changes in the use per unit of output of all inputs.&#13;
In order to determine foreign exchange savings (or earnings) in net terms,&#13;
both output and internationally traded inputs are valued at border prices.&#13;
Factor and other non-traded inputs are valued at shadow prices which&#13;
properly reflect relative scarcities. For a lucid exposition of the&#13;
domestic resource cost indicator, see Bruno (1972).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
this cost can be quite high, to the extent that unit domestic resource costs&#13;
of production may initially be more than twice what can be achieved on the&#13;
basis of less than a decade of experience. But this research clearly cannot&#13;
be taken to mean that experience necessarily leads to greater technological&#13;
mastery and hence to increased productivity. Whether experience produces&#13;
these results depends crucially on the extent and character of directed effort&#13;
to capitalize upon it by undertaking techno:Logical changes, and such effort is&#13;
by no means automatically forthcoming. Nor should this research be considered&#13;
to suggest that all infant industries must depend equally upon internal expe-&#13;
rience to gain technological mastery, or that all infant industries initially&#13;
realize levels of productivity that are equally low relative to what can be&#13;
attained over time.&#13;
Infant industries can obtain technological mastery by means other&#13;
than their own internal experience. Most importantly, mastery acquired in&#13;
relation to one type of activity can -- to varying degrees, depending upon&#13;
the similarity of the underlying technologies -- be applied in relation to&#13;
other types of activities. Thus, as indicated earlier, preceding generations&#13;
of infant industries provide benefits to succeeding generations by augmenting&#13;
the economy's technological mastery. Use of existing technological mastery&#13;
by an infant industry reduces the cost of its development by raising the&#13;
level of productivity with which it starts. Indeed, the use of know-how&#13;
derived from previous experience in closely related types of activity some-&#13;
times provides immediate technological mastery, making the newly established&#13;
activity internationally competitive at its inception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Infant industries can also benefit from foreign technological&#13;
mastery. But the important lesson from research on technological change&#13;
at the firm level, as from other research more directly focused on inter-&#13;
national transfers of technology, is that technological mastery cannot be&#13;
achieved through the passive reception of technology imports. 1/ As stated&#13;
previously, the capacity to use technology effectively results from the effort&#13;
that is associated with the assimilation of technological knowledge. While&#13;
transfers of technology can assist the process of assimilation, they cannot&#13;
wholly substitute for it. Nonetheless, through direct foreign investment,&#13;
infant industries can be developed solely on the basis of foreign technological&#13;
mastery; domestic assimilation of the technology can then proceed over time&#13;
through gradually increasing the involvement of local manpower in various&#13;
aspects of the industry's operation. However, it is an open question whether&#13;
direct foreign investment provides a generally applicable means of greatly&#13;
minimizing or even avoiding the costs of infant industry development. Case&#13;
studies of firms created with direct foreign investment have uncovered in-&#13;
creases in productivity equally as large as those found in domestic firms.&#13;
In fact, the Brazilian steel producer which was discussed above started as&#13;
a joint venture involving Japanese interests.&#13;
To conclude: There clearly is no basis for expecting the costs&#13;
of infant industry development to be the same irrespective of the type of&#13;

activity, 1/ the industrial base that exists at the time of its inception,&#13;
or the manner in which it is established. The case study research that was&#13;
summarized above can thus only be used to infer that infant industry costs&#13;
may sometimes be quite high. The inference is unfortunately weakened by the&#13;
fact that none of the case study research with which I am familiar makes clear&#13;
whether the observed increases in productivity led to international competi-&#13;
tiveness or to something more or less than "best practice" levels of produc-&#13;
tivity. Thus none of this research has attempted to quantify infant indus-&#13;
try costs directly in terms of the implied level of promotional incentives.&#13;
Nevertheless, the research does suggest that -- even for an "effi-&#13;
cient" infant industry, and evaluated at prices that properly reflect relative&#13;
scarcities -- the domestic resource cost of production might initially be as&#13;
much as twice the value of the foreign exchange saved (or earned), with up to&#13;
a decade being required to bring costs down to competitive levels. Assuming&#13;
that production subsidies are used, the implied starting rate of subsidy in&#13;
relation to value added is as much as fifty percent. Alternatively, assuming&#13;
that protection is the instrument of infant industry promotion, the rate of&#13;
effective protection implied at the start of production is as much as one&#13;
hundred percent. 2/ These rates greatly exceed those that are either explicit&#13;
or implicit in the policy advice that is derived from the syntheses of cross-&#13;
country comparative research cited previously.&#13;
1/   Because it appears obvious, the text does not seek to rationalize the&#13;
point that the costs of gaining technological mastery are unlikely to&#13;
be equal for different technologies.&#13;
2/   Throughout this paper, reference is to the rate of effective protection&#13;
after downward adjustment to remove the effect of currency overvaluation;&#13;
i.e., to the so-called "net" rate (see Balassa and Associates, 1971,&#13;
pp. 324 ff.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Conventional Prescriptions Versus Actual Practice&#13;
Conventional prescriptions about promotional incentives for infant&#13;
industries concern both the measures to be used and the appropriate magnitude&#13;
of the incentives. In regard to choosing among measures, there are well&#13;
known theoretical arguments against using protection to promote infant&#13;
industries. Baldwin (1969) provides a particularly compelling statement&#13;
of the theoretical case, by first indicating that the problems of infant&#13;
industries are not necessarily peculiar to them alone and then demonstrating&#13;
that protection may easily fail -- where "more direct and selective policy&#13;
measures" would succeed -- either to offset these problems or to induce the&#13;
appropriate behavior.&#13;
In fact, many governments do employ direct and selective policy&#13;
measures to promote infant industries, though the policies appear frequently&#13;
not to be "first-best:" preferred access to credit on preferred terms may&#13;
be interpreted as a means to overcome imperfections in capital markets and&#13;
differences in private and social evaluations of risk; use of public enter-&#13;
prises or the sanctioning of cartels or monopolies, as a means to insure that&#13;
the returns from technological effort are appropriable; industrial planning&#13;
that includes such things as project identification and preliminary feasibil-&#13;
ity studies, as a means to subsidize the acquisition of initial technological&#13;
information; sharing in the costs of labor training and "research and develop-&#13;
ment," as a means of promoting the direct outlays necessary to achieve socially&#13;
"optimal" levels of knowledge and training; et cetera.&#13;
Nearly all of the same governments nonetheless also protect their&#13;
infant industries against imports. And, whether for practical reasons or&#13;
otherwise, a number of economists have strongly argued in favor of some degree&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
of infant industry protection. Balassa (1975), for example, gives a particu-&#13;
larly detailed and complete set of policy prescriptions derived from the&#13;
cross-country comparative research. He argues for modest levels of infant&#13;
industry protection, and thus advocates a two-tier system of protection:&#13;
uniform effective protection at no more than ten to fifteen percent (p. 375)&#13;
for all manufacturing activities other than infant industries, for which,&#13;
"exceptional cases aside, it does not appear likely that rates of effective&#13;
protection more than double those for mature industries would be warranted on&#13;
infant industry grounds" (p. 376). 1/ In addition, protection to individual&#13;
infant industries should be temporary, according to a preannounced schedule&#13;
that declines to the level of the first tier over a period of, say, five to&#13;
eight years.&#13;
In another paper also concerned with deriving policy implications&#13;
from the empirical evidence, Balassa (1978, p. 50) further argues against&#13;
"differential [or, deliberately discriminatory] treatment to particular manu-&#13;
facturing industries," and states that exceptions from the two-tier system&#13;
"should be made only in cases when it is well established that an industry&#13;
generates substantially greater (lesser) external economies than the average"&#13;
and "in the form of direct measures [eg., direct subsidization of research and&#13;
development] rather than higher rates of protection." As would many other&#13;
researchers in the field, Balassa (1978, p. 50) bases his argument against&#13;
"tailor-made" [or, "made-to-measure," in Corden's (1980) terminology] protec-&#13;
tion on "ignorance as regards interindustry differences in social benefits."&#13;
1/   Reference here is to "potential" effective protection rates; "realized"&#13;
rates may of course be less in some activities and to that degree need&#13;
not be uniform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
But, not only do most governments protect their infant industries,&#13;
many appear to rely upon protection as the principal instrument of promotion&#13;
by granting infant industries effective protection at rates well in excess&#13;
of twenty to thirty percent. Included among the latter are the governments&#13;
of some of the most successfully industrializing countries. The effects of&#13;
initially giving much higher protection to infant industries have by no means&#13;
always been inimical to successful industrialization. I have not tried&#13;
formally to document this observation with the care and precision that is&#13;
needed, but I am quite certain that it can be supported by the historical&#13;
experience of at least several countries. For example, the Republic of Korea&#13;
(or South Korea; hereafter referred to simply as Korea), the developing economy&#13;
with which I am most familiar, appears to have used quite high initial rates&#13;
of infant industry protection with successful results, success here being&#13;
indicated by the rapid achievement of international competitiveness by a&#13;
number of the industries that have been so promoted. 1/ High starting levels&#13;
of protection have also been associated with the successful development of&#13;
various infant industries in other semi-industrial economies, in Latin America&#13;
and elsewhere. (It should not go unnoticed that the indicator of success that&#13;
is being used here is far removed from even a crude assessment of net benefits,&#13;
but it is the only readily available indicator.)&#13;
1/   Evidence of the use of infant industry protection in Korea is given in&#13;
Westphal and Kim (1977), which is summarized in Westphal (1978). In&#13;
turn, there is a variety of circumstantial evidence of its successful&#13;
results, some of which is given in these papers, albeit not in a form&#13;
that makes the case as directly as it might be made. Definitive evidence&#13;
in this regard may be forthcoming from on-going research by two of my&#13;
World Bank colleagues, Garry Pursell and Yung W. Rhee, who are engaged&#13;
in an exhaustive analysis of Korea's export performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Additionally, some countries -- for example, Korea -- appear to have&#13;
fostered the rapid achievement of international competitiveness by infant&#13;
industries which on deliberately discriminatory grounds were initially granted&#13;
whatever levels of effective protection were required to secure an adequate&#13;
market for their output as well as a satisfactory rate of return on invest-&#13;
ment. (In Korea, "tailor-made" infant industry protection has typically been&#13;
afforded via quantitative restrictions on imports; starting levels of effec-&#13;
tive protection of as much as one hundred percent have been observed.) This&#13;
obviously does not necessarily imply that differential treatment and high&#13;
levels of protection are the "optimal" means to promote infant industries;&#13;
but, significantly, it does imply that differential treatment and high levels&#13;
of protection may effectively be used to promote infant industries.&#13;
It is not my purpose to inquire why most governments appear to favor&#13;
protection as the principal instrument of infant industry promotion or to&#13;
argue that they are correct in this respect. Instead, I simply want to estab-&#13;
lish that infant industry protection can "work" in the sense of fostering the&#13;
rapid achievement of internationally competitive levels of productivity. This&#13;
is admittedly a weak conclusion, for it does not even follow that the benefits&#13;
of infant industry protection necessarily exceed the costs in those cases where&#13;
protection works. Moreover, infant industry protection has not always worked.&#13;
As will be shown below, the cross-country comparative research provides a&#13;
possible explanation for why this is so. And, for governments which choose to&#13;
rely on protection as the principal instrument of infant industry promotion,&#13;
this research also suggests how the conventional prescriptions can be reformu-&#13;
lated to take account of the possible need for very high initial rates of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
effective protection. The reformulation leaves intact the most important&#13;
element of the two-tier system of protection advocated by Balassa, though it&#13;
does prescribe highly selective differential treatment to infant industries&#13;
chosen on deliberately discriminatory grounds.&#13;
Reformulation of the Prescription for Infant Industries&#13;
Hereafter I shall be concerned with the question: How should pro-&#13;
tection be applied if it is to be the principal instrument of infant industry&#13;
promotion? The rest of the paper thus assumes that protection is the chosen&#13;
instrument. In addition, following from the previous discussion of the costs&#13;
of infant industry development, it will be assumed that the costs of acquiring&#13;
technological mastery are sometimes sufficiently great to require effective&#13;
protection at rates of close to one hundred percent in order initially to&#13;
insure adequate infant industry incentives. Do these assumptions imply that&#13;
all or a very large subset of the not-yet-established, potential infant indus-&#13;
tries should simultaneously be given effective protection at such high rates?&#13;
The results of the cross-country comparative research clearly indi-&#13;
cate that the answer is no. The countries which have followed this approach&#13;
are those which have opted for an inward-looking strategy of extensive import&#13;
substitution. These countries by-and-large have experienced considerably&#13;
poorer industrial performance than those which have pursued a more outward-&#13;
looking strategy involving greater selectivity in import substitution and&#13;
more attention to the promotion of export growth. Nonetheless, as previously&#13;
indicated, some of the latter countries -- certainly Korea -- have used the&#13;
same means to promote selectively chosen infant industries as have been used&#13;
on a more wholesale basis by the former countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The comparative evidence does not definitively establish that the&#13;
promotion of fewer infant industries at a time results in the more rapid&#13;
achievement of international competitiveness. Nor does it demonstrate that&#13;
faster achievement of international competitiveness by infant industries is&#13;
largely responsible for superior industrial performance. Other elements&#13;
associated with the difference between inward- and outward-looking orienta-&#13;
tions are almost certainly of greater importance. To cite but one such&#13;
element: in company with many other commentators, Diaz-Alejandro (1975)&#13;
has maintained that the debilitating effects of the "stop-go" macro-economic&#13;
policies stemming from poor overall export achievement are among the most&#13;
important factors in explaining the relatively poor performance that seems&#13;
to attend an inward-looking orientation. But, regardless of its relative&#13;
contribution, accelerated productivity improvement in infant industries&#13;
should, in virtually all plausible circumstances, lead to faster-paced indus-&#13;
trial growth overall.&#13;
The real question is thus whether greater selectivity (i.e., the&#13;
promotion of fewer infant industries at a time) results in infant indus-&#13;
tries which either immediately upon their establishment are more efficient&#13;
or after their establishment experience more rapid gains in efficiency,&#13;
efficiency being judged by comparing domestic resource costs against foreign&#13;
exchange savings (or earnings) at prices which properly reflect relative&#13;
scarcities. In view of the paucity of empirical evidence having a bearing&#13;
on this question, it delimits a priority area for further research, though&#13;
various arguments can be made to suggest why the number of infant industries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
simultaneously being promoted ought to affect the speed with which efficient&#13;
production is reached. For example: Greater selectivity in import substi-&#13;
tution undoubtedly accompanies delaying the construction of initial plants&#13;
until the market has grown to an appropriate size; it permits scarce invest-&#13;
ment resources to be concentrated in one or a few sectors at a time and&#13;
thereby enables greater exploitation of economies of scale and of the linkages&#13;
among closely interrelated activities. Greater selectivity equally allows&#13;
the concentration of scarce entrepreneurial resources and technical talent&#13;
and thereby avoids spreading the agents of technological change so thinly&#13;
that no industry has the critical mass which may be necessary to initiate&#13;
a sustained process of efficiency improvement through the acquisition of&#13;
technological mastery. These arguments imply that the warranted degree of&#13;
selectivity depends upon "initial conditions" within a particular country,&#13;
including the overall size of its economy and the availability of high-level&#13;
manpower of various types.&#13;
To summarize: absolute protection to infant industries appears to&#13;
offer a viable means of fostering rapid industrial development, but only if&#13;
a relatively small number of infant industries is promoted at any one time.&#13;
"Absolute" protection here means whatever is necessary to secure an adequate&#13;
market for the industry's output as well as a satisfactory rate of return on&#13;
investment. Absolute protection reflects the efficiency of the industry;&#13;
thus, the level of absolute protection is something that can only be deter-&#13;
mined "endogenously," for example by basing protection on import quotas (but&#13;
see the qualification regarding sales for use in the production of exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
that appears in the section below titled "Export Performance"). As regards&#13;
the precise number of infant industries that it is warranted to promote simul-&#13;
taneously, not much can be said without further research. 1/&#13;
The Evidence Reconsidered&#13;
Absolute, selective infant industry protection is consistent with&#13;
low and uniform effective incentives to all other industrial activities. 2/&#13;
Indeed, the cross-country comparative evidence indicates that low, uniform&#13;
effective incentives to activities that are not being selectively promoted&#13;
is critically important, because it both avoids capricious discrimination&#13;
among these activities and benefits export activity. All syntheses of the&#13;
evidence agree on this fundamental point, as they also concur on the impor-&#13;
tance of incorporating other incentive measures together with protection in&#13;
evaluating an industrial policy regime and of distinguishing between the two&#13;
aspects of the structure of incentives. Of the latter, "industry-bias" refers&#13;
to the variance of the structure as regards the degree to which differential&#13;
incentives are given to different activities; "trade-bias," to the overall&#13;
effect of the structure as regards the encouragement given to import substi-&#13;
tution (or, domestic sales) vis-a-vis export activity.&#13;
Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1978), for instance, in seeking to answer&#13;
why "the superior-export-performance countries do better compared to both&#13;
1/   Observe that the level of aggregation at which industries are delineated&#13;
matters a great deal in this regard.&#13;
2/   "Effective incentives" extends the effective protection concept to&#13;
incorporate the impact of all incentive policy instruments, including&#13;
such measures as cash subsidies, preferential interest rates, and direct&#13;
tax reductions, in addition to protection and whatever other measures&#13;
are actually employed in a given setting. A quantitative implementation&#13;
of this concept is found in Balassa's (1971) measure of the effective&#13;
subsidy rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
their own earlier growth performance under restrictive trade regimes and&#13;
other countries with inferior export performance" (p. 17), observe: "it&#13;
would appear that the pattern of incentives, and hence of export promotion,&#13;
is less skewed [with respect to both trade- and industry-bias] in practice&#13;
than the chaotic pattern of import-substituting incentives under the restric-&#13;
tive trade regimes" (p. 17); thus, "one could argue" that the more "neutral"&#13;
incentives found under the liberalized trade regimes must provide some of&#13;
the explanation for the greater efficiency of the industrialization process&#13;
that is empirically associated with the export-promoting strategy (pp. 18,&#13;
19). By stating the case in such cautious terms ("one can argue"), Bhagwati&#13;
and Srinivasan apparently seek to distance themselves from those [including&#13;
Westphal (1978)] who have in fact argued the case. But, even so, Bhagwati&#13;
and Srinivasan in effect appear to accept its basic validity.&#13;
It would nonetheless be wrong to conclude that neutral incentives&#13;
lead to superior performance, and not merely because industrial incentive pol-&#13;
icies provide only a part of the explanation for better performance. Equally&#13;
important is that some degree of industry-bias is warranted on infant industry&#13;
grounds. In this respect, the selectivity with which infant industries are&#13;
promoted appears to be of far greater consequence than the relative magnitude&#13;
of the effective incentives initially granted to them. This result holds&#13;
irrespective of the part played by protection in the provision of effective&#13;
incentives. In turn, as previously indicated, absolute and selective protec-&#13;
tion to infant industries appears to have been effective in fostering the&#13;
rapid achievement of international competitiveness in at least one (if not&#13;
more) of the "superior-export-performance" countries. Correspondingly, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
single most important policy prescription emanating from past cross-country&#13;
comparative research on trade policy in relation to industrial strategy&#13;
concerns -- not the treatment of infant industries per se, but rather -- the&#13;
efficacy of giving low, uniform effective incentives (hence protection also)&#13;
to all industrial activities except a small number that are being promoted on&#13;
infant industry grounds.&#13;
This is a paradoxical conclusion. Countries which have followed a&#13;
strategy of wholesale import substitution have undoubtedly done so, among&#13;
other reasons, in the expectation that it offers the best means to promote&#13;
the development of infant industries. Yet, by providing very high effective&#13;
incentives to a large number of infant industries simultaneously (and indis-&#13;
criminately), they have failed in effect to provide adequate incentives to any&#13;
one infant industry relative to all other industrial activities, including&#13;
the other infants. In fact, the degree of industry-bias in favor of any one&#13;
infant industry in an inward-looking economy may well be far less than that&#13;
in an outward-looking economy which has practiced greater selectivity in the&#13;
promotion of infant industries and provided low, uniform effective incen-&#13;
tives to activities that are not being selectively promoted. Though further&#13;
research is needed to confirm it, the result appears to be that the infant&#13;
industries of the inward-looking economies are by and large retarded relative&#13;
to those of the outward-looking economies. Consequently, simultaneous pro-&#13;
motion of a large number of infant industries "from the start" does not&#13;
necessarily lead over time to greater breadth and depth of industrialization;&#13;
the sequenced, selective promotion of sub-sets of these industries may over&#13;
the same period of time (which need not be very long) nurture the same indus-&#13;
tries to greater efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Export Performance&#13;
Low levels of effective incentives -- in particular, low levels of&#13;
effective protection to domestic sales -- for activities other than those&#13;
being selectively promoted are also required in order to avoid an anti-export&#13;
trade-bias and thereby to insure adequate export performance. Indeed, the&#13;
improbability of there being adequate export performance if effective incen-&#13;
tives discriminate against exports vis-a-vis domestic sales is perhaps the&#13;
most robust finding from the cross-country comparative research. 1/ Owing&#13;
to the practical difficulty of subsidizing exports at high rates, and the&#13;
likelihood that large subsidies would in any event invite retaliation from&#13;
overseas, provision of adequate effective incentives to exports relative to&#13;
domestic sales precludes anything more than low nominal protection to the&#13;
latter, since export subsidies of one kind or another are required to offset&#13;
whatever protection is given to domestic sales. Again as a practical matter,&#13;
satisfactory export performance has also been shown empirically to necessitate&#13;
access at world prices for tradable inputs used in export production and zero&#13;
or very low exchange rate overvaluation, the latter to insure that the prices&#13;
of nontradable inputs are appropriate (Balassa, 1978). 2/&#13;
1/   There is of course one exception:   namely, an export tax is optimal for&#13;
commodities facing less than infinitely elastic foreign demand. However,&#13;
this exception does not in practice apply in the case of most manufactured&#13;
exports, though the exercise of monopoly power is warranted for products&#13;
subject to import restrictions overseas.&#13;
2/   Unless there is justification for temporary additional incentives to enter&#13;
new foreign markets, exports ideally should receive incentives equal in&#13;
relation to value added to those given to domestic sales. However,&#13;
implementation of the policies indicated here often has the effect of&#13;
giving higher effective incentives to exports; production for domestic&#13;
sale does not necessarily benefit from access to tradable inputs at world&#13;
prices and may not be fully compensated for this by the nominal protection&#13;
which it receives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
The only effective way to guarantee that exporters pay no more than&#13;
world prices for tradable inputs -- including those which they purchase from&#13;
domestic producers -- is to give them unrestricted access to and tariff exemp-&#13;
tions on imported inputs (together with exemptions from indirect taxes on all&#13;
inputs). 1/ Thus domestic producers of intermediate and capital goods should&#13;
be denied any protection against imports that would be used in the production&#13;
of exports. 2/ For all industries -- including selectively promoted infant&#13;
industries -- protection should be given, if at all, only for that part of&#13;
their output which is not sold for use in the manufacture of exports. 3/&#13;
To reflect this in the ensuing discussion, it is necessary to introduce several&#13;
terms: "indirect exports" will denote that part of an industry's output which&#13;
is sold for use in the manufacture of exports; "non-export-related sales" will&#13;
denote an industry's total sales less its "export-related sales," i.e. less&#13;
its exports and its indirect exports.&#13;
1/   Even with slight protection in the domestic market and low currency&#13;
overvaluation, unrestricted access to and tariff exemptions on imported&#13;
inputs leads to a bias in favor of using imported as opposed to domes-&#13;
tically produced inputs in the production of exports. To offset this&#13;
bias, the Korean government provides the full range of its export incen-&#13;
tives to producers of inputs supplied to exporters.&#13;
2/   Satisfactory export performance clearly requires that exporters be per-&#13;
mitted to import capital goods without any restrictions, so that they&#13;
are enabled to use the most appropriate production methods. However,&#13;
it may not preclude levying modest tariff rates on such imports. In&#13;
most industries, capital charges account for a small proportion of total&#13;
production cost (particularly in comparison to intermediate input costs).&#13;
Giving capital goods producers modest protection against imports of capi-&#13;
tal goods by export manufacturers thus would generally have only minor&#13;
effects on the cost competitiveness of exports. Such protection may be&#13;
justified by the unique role of capital goods production in acquiring&#13;
technological mastery.&#13;
3/   This is the qualification to the meaning of absolute protection that&#13;
was referred to in the concluding paragraph of the section above titled&#13;
"Reformulation of the Prescription for Infant Industries."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Industries that have attained internationally competitive levels&#13;
of productivity are responsible for the bulk of export-related sales under the&#13;
"optimal" industrial incentive policy regime.   The prescription that adequate&#13;
effective incentives be provided to exports relative to domestic sales applies&#13;
to these industries, and is further implemented by providing low nominal&#13;
protection to their non-export-related sales, something which in principal is&#13;
easily accomplished (given the proper exchange rate) by virtue of their effi-&#13;
ciency. In turn, it might be expected that giving absolute protection to&#13;
non-export-related sales by selectively promoted infant industries would,&#13;
in the absence of high offsetting subsidies, preclude their exporting, either&#13;
directly or indirectly (i.e., by sales to exporters). However, certainly in&#13;
Korea, this is not the case.&#13;
Infant industries in Korea begin exporting -- both directly and&#13;
indirectly -- at a very early stage, often at once, notwithstanding that these&#13;
sales do not receive subsidies sufficient to offset the absolute protection&#13;
that is granted only to non-export-related sales. 1/ For infant industries in&#13;
Korea (as elsewhere), effective incentives -- including all of those measures&#13;
for which quantification is possible -- are far greater for non-export-related&#13;
sales than for export-related sales. But many of these industries are either&#13;
monopolized or operate as cartels, which implies that export-related sales may&#13;
be explained in terms of discriminating monopoly.&#13;
1/   Direct exports from selectively promoted infant industries never appear&#13;
to have accounted for more than -- at most -- a quarter of Korea's manu-&#13;
factured exports. (Comparable information is not available in regard&#13;
to indirect exports.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
The theory pertaining to discriminating monopoly indicates that non-&#13;
competitive firms may find it profitable to sell some of their output at world&#13;
prices even though these prices are less than the prices received for non-&#13;
export-related sales. 1/ The theory states that a monopoly or cartel that&#13;
sells the same product in several distinct markets will allocate its sales&#13;
so as to equate marginal revenues across markets, one to another and to the&#13;
marginal cost of production. As a result, there will be an inverse relation&#13;
between the prices charged and the demand elasticities in the various markets.&#13;
On the highly plausible assumption that the elasticity of demand for non-ex-&#13;
port-related sales is less than the elasticity of demand for export-related&#13;
sales, 2/ the price in the protected segment of the domestic market will&#13;
exceed the border prices for direct and indirect exports. 3/ Thus, assum-&#13;
ing that protection enables separating the market for non-export-related&#13;
sales from the markets for export-related sales and that the separable costs&#13;
of entering into export activity are negligible, a monopolized or cartelized&#13;
industry which acts to maximize its total profits may reasonably be expected&#13;
to engage in export-related sales up to the point where the marginal cost of&#13;
production equals the marginal revenue from these sales and to adjust its&#13;
production and non-export-related sales accordingly.&#13;
1/   For the application of this theory to international trade, see Corden&#13;
(1967), Pursell and Snape (1973), White (1974), or Caves (1978).&#13;
2/   Note that the "small-country assumption," under which the country is&#13;
assumed to be a price-taker in international markets, implies that export&#13;
demand is infinitely elastic. On this assumption, the derived demand for&#13;
indirect exports is also -- in essence -- infinitely elastic.&#13;
3/   Border prices for direct and indirect exports are not equal; respec-&#13;
tively, they are the f.o.b. export price and the c.i.f. import price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
There is evidence that the Korean government has sanctioned non-&#13;
competitive market structures in order to elicit export-related sales from&#13;
infant industries. 1/ Moreover, the government has at its disposal several&#13;
policy instruments which in combination may be used to stimulate direct and&#13;
indirect exports from non-competitive infant industries. Chief among these&#13;
is the export targeting system, which applies to both direct and indirect&#13;
exports, and under which indicative export targets are set jointly by the&#13;
government and the various exporters associations (virtually every industry&#13;
of any consequence has an exporters association). And subsidies to export-&#13;
related sales sometimes appear to have been jointly negotiated simultaneously&#13;
with export targets. 2/ But the government's leverage over these industries&#13;
derives primarily from its control of the banking system and thereby of credit&#13;
rationing. Preferential access to credit for financing of fixed investment&#13;
as well as of working capital has been a potent instrument in the promotion&#13;
of new industrial activities.&#13;
1/   The sheltering of non-export-related sales as a means of encouraging&#13;
export-related sales has not gone unnoticed by other observers of the&#13;
Korean scene; see, for example, Krueger (1978, Chapter 12).&#13;
2/   One of these subsidies operates through the "wastage allowance" that&#13;
is permitted when determining tariff-free raw material imports for use&#13;
in export-related production. To subsidize direct and indirect exports,&#13;
this allowance is usually in excess of actual wastage. Because profits&#13;
can be earned by using the excess imports to produce for sale on the&#13;
protected segment of the domestic market, control over the amount of&#13;
tariff-free imported inputs allowed in relation to the volume of export-&#13;
related sales (and hence, implicitly, over the amount of excess imports)&#13;
gives the government a means to influence the division between export-&#13;
related and non-export-related sales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Infant Industry Exports&#13;
I don't know for certain whether other governments similarly encour-&#13;
age infant industries to engage in export-related production. But it is none-&#13;
theless pertinent to analyze the costs and benefits associated with infant&#13;
industry exports (here taken to include both direct and indirect exports),&#13;
for there is evidence that export activity can tremendously hasten the process&#13;
and greatly reduce the costs of achieving technological mastery. But before&#13;
turning to this evidence it is necessary to indicate that there may also be&#13;
costs. These costs stem from the fact that an infant industry may practice&#13;
discriminatory pricing such that export-related production leads to an increase&#13;
in the price at which non-export-related sales are made. Granted that an&#13;
infant industry experiences a low level of efficiency, cross-subsidization&#13;
of sales at border prices by non-export-related sales at higher prices is&#13;
required unless there are offsetting subsidies, as there typically appear not&#13;
to be.&#13;
It is widely appreciated that protection imposes real costs on&#13;
domestic consumers, at least in the short run. These costs may be increased&#13;
by the practice of discriminatory pricing on the part of infant industries.&#13;
Under the usual assumptions, including that economies of scale are not sub-&#13;
stantial in relation to the size of the market for non-export-related sales,&#13;
export-related production that results from discriminatory pricing can be&#13;
shown to impose greater costs on domestic consumers: that is, compared to a&#13;
situation in which the industry produces only for non-export-related sales,&#13;
production for export-related sales leads to lower non-export-related sales&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
(even though total output rises), and thereby to a price for non-export-&#13;
related sales higher than that which would obtain were there no export-related&#13;
production. 1/&#13;
This result critically depends upon the assumption that there are&#13;
no economies of scale to be exploited through export activity. But most&#13;
industries are characterized by increasing returns to scale up to a non-&#13;
negligible size. And developing countries sometimes appear to establish&#13;
individual industries well before the market for non-export-related sales has&#13;
attained the size at which increasing returns are exhausted. In such cases,&#13;
and to the degree that it is associated with larger scale production, even&#13;
with discriminatory pricing, export activity can reduce unit costs of pro-&#13;
duction and thereby lead to domestic prices lower than those which would&#13;
prevail in its absence. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that&#13;
export-related production, though associated with discriminatory pricing,&#13;
may sometimes lower the costs imposed on domestic consumers by the promotion&#13;
of infant industries.&#13;
But even leaving this consideration aside, it is very likely that&#13;
infant industry exports yield sizable net benefits, because export activity&#13;
appears to accelerate the acquisition of technological mastery and hence&#13;
to hasten productivity improvement and efficiency gains. Insofar as they&#13;
result from inadequate technological mastery (as opposed to the exercise&#13;
of monopoly power), the costs imposed by infant industry protection are&#13;
1/   For the reasoning leading to this result, see any of the references&#13;
cited in footnote 1 on page 26.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
transitory and diminish over time as technological mastery is acquired.&#13;
Anything which accelerates the attainment of technological mastery also&#13;
quickens the pace at which the costs of infant industry protection decline.&#13;
Correspondingly, even if infant industry exports initially impose additional&#13;
costs owing to the practice of discriminatory pricing, they can nonetheless&#13;
yield substantial net benefits over time as a result of their effects leading&#13;
to more rapid productivity improvement and efficiency gains.&#13;
There are various grounds for asserting that export activity must&#13;
lead infant industries to realize faster technological change. To the degree&#13;
that efficiency improvement and other forms of technological change derive&#13;
from experience in production and in capacity expansion, export activity&#13;
must necessarily lead to greater technological change if it is associated&#13;
with greater volumes of production over time. But the direct effects of&#13;
export activity in both enforcing and fostering technological mastery are&#13;
undoubtedly the most important. As to enforcing technological mastery,&#13;
exporting -- whether directly or indirectly -- requires the ability to meet&#13;
world standards in matching specifications given by the type and quality of&#13;
product involved. In turn, as to fostering technological mastery, efforts&#13;
to maintain and increase penetration in overseas markets lead to the gradual&#13;
upgrading of product quality. In addition, and perhaps most important, there&#13;
is clear evidence from Korea as well as from elsewhere that exporters enjoy&#13;
virtually costless access to a tremendous range of technological improvements&#13;
that are diffused to them through various activities of the buyers of their&#13;
exports. 1/ Not only do buyers contribute product designs and help to install&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

or improve methods of quality control, they also contribute to achieving&#13;
greater efficiency and lower costs through such things as suggesting changes&#13;
in individual elements of production processes and improvements in the organi-&#13;
zation of production within plants and in management techniques more gener-&#13;
ally.&#13;
A strong case can thus be made that the promotion of infant industry&#13;
exports provides an effective means to hasten the achievement of international&#13;
competitiveness. The argument may not pertain, however, to exports from&#13;
infant industries created by establishing subsidiaries of multinational cor-&#13;
porations, for there is no assurance that the activities of these firms will&#13;
contribute to domestic human capital formation or in other ways yield real&#13;
externalities through the diffusion of technological mastery to local pro-&#13;
ducers. (In this respect it is pertinent to note that most of Korea-s ex-&#13;
ports are produced by wholely local firms.) In any event, further research&#13;
is needed to verify that export activity induces faster technological prog-&#13;
ress, as well as to examine whether and how export activity conditions the&#13;
direction of technological change and to demonstrate that infant industry&#13;
exports do indeed result in positive net benefits over time to the economy&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
Conclusion -- Implications for Industrial Strategy&#13;
The foregoing discussion provides one possible reason why the indus-&#13;
trial sector in a country like Korea, following an outward-looking strategy,&#13;
performs so well; namely, the possibility that its selectively promoted infant&#13;
industries exhibit superior performance as a result of their export activity.&#13;
This is by no means to suggest that it is the only possible reason. But, if&#13;
valid, its relative importance must increase as the time period of analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
lengthens, since the number of infant industries that achieve international&#13;
competitiveness can be expected to increase with the length of the time&#13;
period, as can the relative contribution of these industries to the economy's&#13;
total industrial production.&#13;
The questions that remain concern how the choice of infant indus-&#13;
tries for selective promotion affects industrial performance. Does it make&#13;
any difference which industries are selected; if so, how should infant indus-&#13;
tries be chosen? The issues involved in the selection of infant industries&#13;
appear to be far more complex than those relating to how they are to be pro-&#13;
moted. Comprehensive discussion of these issues must therefore be left to&#13;
a future paper. But several issues do deserve brief discussion here.&#13;
Potential infant industries are by no means similar in their need&#13;
for selective promotion, which is most likely to be warranted where the costs&#13;
of acquiring technological mastery are quite high. But selective promotion is&#13;
warranted only if the benefits of attaining technological mastery appear to&#13;
outweigh the costs, and then only if the necessary technological effort is&#13;
unlikely to be undertaken by individual producers in the absence of selective&#13;
promotion. Many potential infant industries can -- and therefore should --&#13;
be established without selective promotion. This is particularly true for&#13;
those that can benefit from previous experience in closely related types of&#13;
activity. Indeed, many of the most successful infant industries in Korea&#13;
have not benefitted from selective promotion, including a number of important&#13;
export industries. Thus it is critically important not to discriminate against&#13;
the development of infant industries that are not being selectively promoted.&#13;
This is in fact one of the strongest arguments for low, uniform effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
incentives -- in particular, low and uniform effective protection to&#13;
non-export-related sales -- for all activities except those being selectively&#13;
promoted. It provides an equally strong argument against the use of quantita-&#13;
tive import restrictions (as opposed to tariffs), as well as against the use&#13;
of various forms of restrictive controls on new undertakings.&#13;
It must also be recognized that the choice of infant industries for&#13;
selective promotion is not something to be done without regard to existing&#13;
circumstances or without active consultation between government and prospec-&#13;
tive producers. Choices must be made with a view to existing levels of tech-&#13;
nological mastery and to the transferability of technological mastery across&#13;
successive generations of infant industries. A substantial expenditure of&#13;
effort in searching for and making use of technological and economic infor-&#13;
mation is needed to make sound choices. Much of this effort should be, and&#13;
often is, undertaken by prospective producers, but their forecasts of costs&#13;
and benefits require independent appraisal. Furthermore, choices should be&#13;
subject to revision in the light of additional information and experience&#13;
gained in successive phases of identification and implementation. Indeed,&#13;
it is to be expected that some mistakes will be made in the initial identi-&#13;
fication of particular types of activity as being suitable for selective&#13;
promotion. It is therefore very important to recognize mistakes and take&#13;
remedial action quickly, as well as to learn from past mistakes in making&#13;
future choices. These and many other considerations imply that selective&#13;
infant industry promotion requires a high level of competence in its admin-&#13;
istration. Such competence can be learned, but it is apparent that condi-&#13;
tions conducive to its being learned and effectively applied are not present&#13;
in all countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Finally, what importance should be attached to trading possibilities&#13;
in the choice of infant industries for selective promotion? Even granted that&#13;
comparative advantage is not innate, but is acquired through effort to achieve&#13;
technological mastery, it does not follow that trading possibilities should be&#13;
neglected. What is remarkable in this respect about a country like Korea is&#13;
that infant industries often appear to be selectively promoted on the grounds&#13;
of their export potential, while infants selectively promoted on other grounds&#13;
are also expected to develop exports, either directly or indirectly. Moreover,&#13;
the Korean government has on several occassions put aside its initial plans&#13;
for selectively promoting particular industries when additional information&#13;
indicated that they would not achieve international competitiveness within a&#13;
reasonable length of time.&#13;
These may be the most important distinguishing characteristics of&#13;
an export promoting strategy. In turn, as already suggested, the efficacy&#13;
of this strategy might also be found in the impact of export activity on the&#13;
speed with which technological mastery is acquired and the pace at which&#13;
technological change takes place. These observations could provide a large&#13;
part of the explanation for why such a pronounced difference in growth per-&#13;
formance is associated with a strategy of export promotion as contrasted&#13;
with one of import substitution. But further research is needed to confirm&#13;
that the dynamics of technological change are indeed central to understanding&#13;
this difference, and that the implications for industrial policy conform to&#13;
the reformulation of conventional prescriptions given above.&#13;
Postscript&#13;
To the degree that the foregoing arguments rest on what I believe&#13;
underlies Korea's successful industrialization, it is important to give&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
explicit recognition to the fact that Korea's industrialization appears&#13;
recently to have faltered somewhat. In particular, substantial difficulty&#13;
has been encountered in developing its most recent set of infant indus-&#13;
tries, which are in the so-called "heavy" industries. What I know about the&#13;
situation suggests that the difficulty stems from the Korean government's&#13;
initial decision to promote too many infant industries at once and from its&#13;
subsequent -- and newly acquired -- reluctance to abandon or radically revise&#13;
its plans on the basis of information and experience accumulated over time.&#13;
Thus, Korea's recent problems may provide additional evidence to support the&#13;
need for selectivity in the promotion of infant industries.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper argues that the emiprical
            evidence does not disprove the efficacy of high levels of
            selective infant industry protection. The argument is based
            on two types of evidence. Recent research on technological
            change in developing countries provides considerable
            information about the nature of the costs and benefits of
            infant industry development, together with a tentative
            indication of the magnitude of the costs. In turn, recently
            completed cross-country comparative research provides some
            tentative lessons about the promotion of infant industries
            by means of trade policies.
