                               PART 1.          COUNTRY ISSUES&#13;
&#13;
A.       Backgroundand Transitionto Peace&#13;
&#13;
1. Liberia had been a middle-income country before the civil war began in late 1989. Fifteen&#13;
years o f brutal conflict devastated the country's economy, its physical infrastructure, and its&#13;
human assets. In August 2003, the warring parties ended hostilities with the signing o f the&#13;
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in Accra, Ghana, and a National Transitional&#13;
Government (NTGL) was established to administer a two-year interim period leading to national&#13;
elections inOctober 2005. The UnitedNations Mission inLiberia (UNMIL)was created and was&#13;
given the mandate to support the implementation o f the peace process. Over the last two and a&#13;
half years, the peace in Liberia has been made possible inlarge part by the presence o f the 15,000&#13;
UNMILtroops stationedthere.&#13;
&#13;
2. Liberia today i s one o f Africa's poorest nations, with a GDP per capita o f approximately&#13;
$151. While accurate data i s not available, it is estimated that close to one million people fled&#13;
from cities, villages, and towns to the neighboring countries o f Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote'&#13;
d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria, and other countries'. Over 350,000 people moved into Internally&#13;
Displaced Camps (IDC) across the country. The subsequent social and human capital costs have&#13;
been enormous.&#13;
&#13;
3. In December 2003, the UNDP and the World Bank undertook a joint mission to conduct a&#13;
needs assessment for Liberia. This led to the development o f a Results Focused Transitional&#13;
Framework (RFTF) which served as a strategic plan for the NTGL, as a partnership agreement&#13;
between Liberia and its donor partners, and as a time-bound management tool for tracking&#13;
progress in critical areas. These activities in the RFTF were organized by cluster, and the Bank&#13;
took the lead in the Infrastructure and Economic Management clusters.         With a lead role in&#13;
Infrastructure, the Bank agreed to undertake assessments o f the emergency needs in transport,&#13;
power, water, and telecommunications. In every sector emergency works as well as longer-term&#13;
development needs were identified.&#13;
&#13;
4. Despite efforts within the framework o f the RFTF, the primary challenge for the transitional&#13;
Government remained the inability to reign in high incidences o f corruption, non-transparency&#13;
and financial mismanagement at all levels o f Government. The deteriorating economic and&#13;
fiduciary  governance placed Liberia's recovery at risk. The response o f the NTGL and its&#13;
development partners responded by developing the Governance and Economic Management&#13;
Assistance Program (GEMAP) which was backed by the Security Council in a resolution passed&#13;
inJune, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
5. The GEMAP has introduced measures to strengthen fiscal administration and improve&#13;
transparency and accountability by securing Liberia's revenue base and improving budgeting and&#13;
expenditure management. Steadfast implementation o f the GEMAP, together with strong&#13;
performance under the staff-monitored program (SMP), would pave the way toward the de-&#13;
escalation o f the IMF's remedial measures against Liberia and the normalization o f relations with&#13;
International Financial Institutions (IFIs). In addition, the successful implementation o f GEMAP&#13;

i s expected to constitute an important step towards lifting o f UNsanctions on diamond and timber&#13;
exports'. Following the elections, the new Government o f Liberia (GOL) endorsed the GEMAP&#13;
as a necessary step in enhancing governance practices and has already made progress in budget&#13;
management, revenue generation and concession reviews during the first few months inoffice. In&#13;
the context o f the fiscal disarray inherited by the Government, the actions taken to strengthen&#13;
revenue collection and public expenditure management (through the enforcement o f pre-shipment&#13;
inspections, reestablishment o f the Cash Management Committee, and prudent budget allocations&#13;
for line ministries) are commendable.&#13;
&#13;
6. In October-November 2005, legislative and presidential elections were held, leading to the&#13;
inauguration on January 6, 2006 o f Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.           The new Government o f Liberia&#13;
(GOL) has embraced the GEMAP as a necessary instrument to begin tackling the financial&#13;
management challenges they face. Government has already made progress during the first few&#13;
months in office. Inthe context o f the fiscal disarray inherited by the Government, the actions&#13;
taken to strengthen revenue collection and public expenditure management (through the&#13;
enforcement o f pre-shipment inspections, reestablishment o f the Cash Management Committee,&#13;
and prudentbudget allocations for line ministries) are commendable.&#13;
&#13;
 7. In light o f the progress on economic reforms under the new Government, the Government&#13;
and the IMF staff reached an agreement on policies to be implemented under a Staff Monitored&#13;
Program (SMP), covering February-September 2006. If sufficient indications o f support from&#13;
donors are forthcoming, strong performance under the SMP could form the basis for a subsequent&#13;
program, which inturn could lead to the eventual arrears clearance and the resolution o f Liberia's&#13;
 debt overhang. Arrears clearance would restore normal relations between Liberia and the I F I s&#13;
 and would renew access to regular IDA-resources. This proposed pre-arrears clearance grant i s&#13;
 designed to help the Government restore critical infrastructure and basic services and bridge the&#13;
 funding gap inthe interimperiodprior to new IDA-resources becoming available.&#13;
&#13;
 8. In preparation for a new engagement between Government and development partners,&#13;
 Government constituted the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC) as the&#13;
 main body to design, develop, coordinate and monitor the implementation o f a results-based&#13;
 national reconstruction and development program. The LRDC i s chaired by the President and&#13;
 involves key GOL Ministers as well as. It i s organized around four pillars: i)Security, ii)&#13;
 Economic Revitalization, iii)Governance and Rule o f Law, and iv) Infrastructure and Basic&#13;
 Services. The Bank i s a Co-Chair o f the Economic Revitalization and the Infrastructureand Basic&#13;
 Services Committees. The latter, chaired by the Minister o f Public Works includes all&#13;
 infi-astructure sectors as well as health and education. On the Government's side, only the four&#13;
 leading ministers and the Secretariat o f the Presidency sit at the LRDC, while coordination&#13;
 among ministries operating within a given pillar takes place within the four sub-committees. In&#13;
 the case o f the Infrastructure and Basic Services Pillar, therefore, initial sector trade-offs in the&#13;
 use o f donor resources are discussed within the pillar, among the concerned ministers and donors,&#13;
 prior to reachingthe LRDC, generating a more systematic and orderly decision-makingprocess.&#13;
&#13;
 9. At the first meeting o f the LRDC inFebruary 2006, the President affirmed the Government's&#13;
 commitment to develop a robust PRSP that will articulate priorities for public spending on social&#13;
 and strategic areas. She requested that international partners assist in the process leading to a&#13;
 PRSP by June 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The UNembargo o n the export o f timber and diamonds was imposed inDecember 2003 to stop the&#13;
 financing of armed conflict inLiberia and the sub-region and was renewed inNovember 2005. The next&#13;
 mid-term review o f the sanctions will take place inJune 2006.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.       Economic and Social Impact of the Conflict&#13;
&#13;
10. The challenges facing the new Government are immense as they try to rebuild the country's&#13;
infrastructure, restore basic financial management, and mend the social fabric that was destroyed&#13;
during the war. Regional conflict, still present in CGte d'Ivoire, continues to threaten the fragile&#13;
peace in Liberia as well as in Sierra Leone. The decades o f conflict, conflict-driven migration and&#13;
a heritage o f corruption have undermined domestic capacity and drained the pool o f skilled&#13;
human resources, many o f whom left the country&#13;
&#13;
11, Following a sharp decline ineconomic activity in2003, real GDP continues to recover (2.6%&#13;
in2004 and 5.3% in2005). However, the recovery of agricultural activity has been sporadic due&#13;
to the slow return of refugees to rural areas and largely destroyed or non-existent infrastructure.&#13;
T w o o f the country's major sources o f export revenues and fiscal receipts (diamonds and forest&#13;
products) are under international sanctions by the UN Security Council due to their past role in&#13;
financing conflict in the region. Unemployment i s estimated at 85%3. Poverty i s widespread, The&#13;
share o f people living on less that US$l/day has increased from 55% in 19974to 76% in 20015.&#13;
Income-generating opportunities are limited as a result o f losses incurred during the conflict&#13;
resulting in a narrow economic base. For example, the country's rural and urban road networks&#13;
providing vital farm to market access have not been maintained or repaired for decades. At the&#13;
same time, the prospects for capital formation and entrepreneurship have been severely undercut&#13;
creating disincentives for private investment. Access to commercial capital i s almost non-&#13;
existent. Basic education and health care remain unavailable or unaffordable for most children&#13;
and people. Selected human development indicators inLiberia are shown inTable 1.&#13;

C.      Sector Issues&#13;
&#13;
C.l     Transport Sector&#13;
&#13;
C1.1 Overview&#13;
&#13;
12. Prior to the civil war the transport sector in Liberia included road and railway networks, a&#13;
network o f operational airports and aerodromes, and several ports. Today, the railway network i s&#13;
destroyed does not exist, civil aviation i s limited to international and regional flights using&#13;
Monrovia with only UN flights operating domestically, and the Port o f Monrovia i s the only&#13;
operational port in the country. Duringthe years o f conflict, the sector was unable to undertake&#13;
regular routine and periodic maintenance activities. Partial rehabilitation and new construction&#13;
were sporadic and limited in scope. As a result o f the chronic underinvestment and lack o f&#13;
maintenance the rehabilitation requirements o f the sector have already surpassed emergency&#13;
conditions. On nearly every road link, in the ports and at the airports, lack o f regular maintenance&#13;
causes emergency conditions on a daily basis.&#13;
&#13;
13. The roads sub-sector i s by far the most important sector in terms o f freight volumes and&#13;
passengers transported. Maritime transport i s restricted to importlexport activities in the Port o f&#13;
Monrovia, while domestic civil aviation activities are nearly non-existent. The railway sector was&#13;
developed in support o f inland iron ore mining activities and it i s expected that its revival will&#13;
depend solely on similar developments. Such investments are expected to be funded by the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
&#13;
14. The state of the transportation infrastructure in Liberia directly affects its potential for&#13;
economic development and trade facilitation. International road links are poor, farm to market&#13;
access i s poor and, in many previously productive agricultural areas, impossible duringthe rainy&#13;
season. Travel time i s extremely long, and upcountry areas are completely cut o f f in the months&#13;
o f April to September. With UN sanctions on timber and diamond production and export&#13;
expected to be lifted soon, demands on the transportation network will skyrocket.&#13;
&#13;
15. Accessibility impacts security. UNMIL, whose mandate i s to guarantee security, i s&#13;
continuously re-aligning resources to emergency repairs on the primary and secondary road&#13;
networks usingits civilian and military engineers. The quality o f these emergency interventions i s&#13;
often not good and the roads soon return to their original poor condition.&#13;
&#13;
16. The Government recognizes the urgency o f the situation and has requested donors' assistance&#13;
for the sector. Starting in 2005, the Bank financed the technical assessment o f two o f the main&#13;
road corridors in the country (Monrovia-Buchanan and Monrovia-Ganta), the Port o f Monrovia&#13;
and the Roberts InternationalAirport (Infrastructure TA, TFLIB-funded). These studies identified&#13;
emergency works and developed bidding documents that have been shared with donors. Donor&#13;
support pledged thus far i s not enough to re-instate transport services to pre-emergency levels.&#13;
&#13;
C1.2     Road Sub-sector&#13;
&#13;
17. Rebuilding the road sector i s also a top Government priority. The TFLIB-financed technical&#13;
assessment focused on two primary road links; Monrovia-Buchanan (the link between the two&#13;
largest population centres) and Monrovia-Ganta-Guinea Border (the most important road linking&#13;
Monrovia with the interior and with one neighbouring country). The assessment identified&#13;
emergency works on these links in excess o f $20 million including bridge repairs, pothole and&#13;
other pavement repairs, drainage repairs and basic road safety activities like painting lane&#13;
markings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18. The proclaimed road network has not changed since prior to the conflict and i s divided as per&#13;
Table 2. Inaddition to these there are many roads that are currently used as if they form part of&#13;
the public road network. These include: logging roads and roads developed by communities and&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      Roads(km)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19. Government has not undertaken any road condition surveys since the beginning o f the&#13;
conflict. Also, very little road maintenance was carried out during this time. Reports from donor&#13;
agencies, NGOs and the Government confirm that most o f these roads are either ina poor or very&#13;
poor condition.&#13;
&#13;
20. The road network also includes a substantial bridge and culvert inventory with many bridges&#13;
and culverts washed away, collapsed or badly damaged. Many more are inurgent need o f repair.&#13;
Due to the war the MPW has not been able to undertake a formal bridge inspection for at least the&#13;
last 20 years. NGOs and other donors are improving access to rural communities by re-instating&#13;
the smaller culverts and bridges but large areas o f the country still have only limited access due to&#13;
these missinglinksinthe road network.&#13;
&#13;
21. The urban roads are also in a poor condition. The road condition inMonrovia is acute due to&#13;
the high traffic volumes throughout the city. There are specific areas that experience congestion&#13;
for most o f the day. The uncontrolled spread o f market places i s also a major contributor to the&#13;
deteriorating traffic conditions.&#13;
&#13;
C1.3     CivilAviation&#13;
&#13;
22. Roberts International Airport (RIA), about 45 km outside Monrovia, is the only international&#13;
airport in the country and the only airport open for fixed wing aircraft. James Spriggs Payne,&#13;
located within Monrovia's city boundaries as well as several other airports are operated by and&#13;
used only for UN flights to transport UN personnel and equipment. All other domestic civil&#13;
aviation ceased duringthe years o f strife.&#13;
&#13;
23. Before the war, Liberia had one operational international airline, Liberia Airways. However,&#13;
it has since been closed and its assets sold off. At present, air traffic is sparse with only one&#13;
international airline and three infrequent West African carriers servicing Liberia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24. The TFLIB-financed technical assessment o f Roberts International Airport estimates the&#13;
extent of the emergency works at about US$3.6 million. The most critical activity will be&#13;
financed with TFLIB resources as Liberia Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (LIRP) which i s&#13;
currently under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
C1.4     Ports&#13;
&#13;
25. Liberia has five ports, including Monrovia, Buchanan, Greenville, Harper and Robertsport.&#13;
Before the war these ports handled about 200,000 tons o f general cargo and around 400,000 tons&#13;
of petroleum products per year. Inaddition, Monrovia and Buchananhandled all the bulkiron ore&#13;
exports, and Buchanan and Greenville were responsible for most o f the timber exports.&#13;
&#13;
26. The war and the international sanctions severely disrupted port operations while extensive&#13;
looting rendered most o f the facilities useless. Today, nearly 100% o f the fuel, dry-bulk and&#13;
container trade i s handled in the Port o f Monrovia. The other ports are barely operational with&#13;
trans-shipment activities between Monrovia and the four smaller ports beingnegligible.&#13;
&#13;
27. The TFLIB-financed technical assessment o f the Port o f Monrovia identified emergency&#13;
works in excess o f US$30 million. The LIRP, currently under preparation, proposes to support&#13;
the most critical repairs costed at about USS7.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
C1.5     Railways&#13;
&#13;
28. The railway network in Liberia was constructed by the mining companies to transport iron&#13;
ore from the now closed iron ore mines at Mano River (Grand Cape Mount County), Bong Town&#13;
(Bong County), and the Ganta-Yekepa area (Nimba County) to the ports o f Monrovia and&#13;
Buchanan. The total length o f the network was about 500 km.The last mine closed soon after the&#13;
war started in 1986. Since then tracks were left unattended.&#13;
&#13;
29. Recently, international mining companies showed interest in re-opening the old mines and&#13;
developing deposits in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. This suggests that the demand for a rail link to&#13;
the coast may develop with firm decisions to establish mining activities at any o f these locations.&#13;
Such developments are ideally suited for private sector development with the Yekepa-Buchanan-&#13;
link and the rehabilitation and expansion of capacity at the port of Buchanan being the most&#13;
likely.&#13;
&#13;
 C1.6     Institutional Framework&#13;
&#13;
30. Up until 2006 with the inauguration o f the new Government, management o f the transport&#13;
sector among several Ministries. The Ministry o f Transport (MOT) i s responsible for transport&#13;
 sector policy development and regulation. The responsibility for managing the proclaimed&#13;
network was divided between two Ministries, the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW) being&#13;
responsible for the primary and secondary roads and the Ministry of Rural Development being&#13;
responsible for the feeder and farm to market roads. The new Government transferred all road&#13;
infrastructure responsibilities to the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW).&#13;
&#13;
 31, Duringthe war these Ministries lost their capacity to manage their respective functions. They&#13;
 lost their data and documentation and currently rely on collective memory to determine road data.&#13;
They were unable to undertake regular road condition assessments. They confirm that almost no&#13;
road maintenance was done from 1986 to date. As a result, most roads are in a poor to very poor&#13;
 condition. All offices of the two new Ministries have been completely looted and there i s no&#13;
 equipment left. Both Ministries are in dire need o f all types o f basic office equipment, vehicles,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and specialised engineering gear. MPW has a small core o f technical and maintenance staff&#13;
remaining from the periodprior to the war. However, the lack o f any kindo f equipment, years o f&#13;
skills atrophy and very little training, limits the capacity o f the MPW to carry out most o f the&#13;
tasks associated with reconstruction efforts. A report drafted by UNMIL (September 2004) shows&#13;
that the MPW as a whole had about 2,240 employees prior to the war with only 943 remaining in&#13;
September 2004. M P W executes its functions through 16 maintenance districts and also managed&#13;
a RoadMaintenanceTraining Centre. These facilities have all been destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
32. Additional to the emergency works Government identified the urgent need to rebuild the&#13;
capacity o f the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW) to effectively manage the road network. This&#13;
includes the provision o f equipment and systems as well as the development o f strategies that&#13;
include a longer term vision for the sub-sector. The MPW i s one o f the two Ministries involved in&#13;
the transport sector. MOT i s responsible for regulating the transport sector with MPW i s&#13;
responsible for managing, amongst others, the nationalroadnetwork.&#13;
&#13;
C2       Water sector&#13;
&#13;
C2.1 Overview&#13;
&#13;
33. Prior to the war, Monrovia (as well as several cities outside o f the capital) had a functioning,&#13;
piped water supply system providing service via communal and individual water points.&#13;
Monrovia even enjoyed a sewer network, which, decades later, continues to be uncommon in&#13;
most o f West Africa. About 22,000 water connections were active at the time. Water services at&#13;
communal water points were provided free o f charge and the responsible authority, the Public&#13;
Utilities Authority (PUA), used to pass the cost o f the water services to the Government's&#13;
account. Individual consumers were charged on a flat rate basis.&#13;
&#13;
34. Since 1973 Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) i s responsible for dnnking water&#13;
supply and sewerage services inMonrovia, secondary county-cities, and all rural areas o fLiberia.&#13;
In 1980 a water treatment plant, at White Plains, and a closed ring of primary water mains were&#13;
completed to provide a design capacity up to 16 million gallons (60,567 m') per day to&#13;
Monrovia's 450,000 inhabitants at that time. The treatment plant was fed with raw water and&#13;
electricity from the Mount Coffee Dam, about 8 km upstream.               During the war the dam&#13;
overtopped and broke, severely affecting the production capacity o f the purification plant. The&#13;
dam's hydropower electricity supply was substituted by generator sets located at the plant and it&#13;
now extracts raw water directly from the St. Paul River. Current production i s about 1.2 million&#13;
gallons per day (4,542 m3/day), or about 7.5 % o f it i s original capacity-for        a Monrovian&#13;
population o f more than a million people. Only a small part o f Monrovia currently has piped&#13;
water, with most water deliveredby truck.&#13;
35. A supplementary water supply o f two deep wellshore-holes were drilled in 1993 at the&#13;
Eastern end o f town (capacity o f 27 and 22 m' per hour) from which clean water i s trucked and&#13;
distributed to the Eastern suburbs.&#13;
36. The distribution network o f ductile or galvanized iron pipes in Monrovia has not been used&#13;
since 1990 and has been seriously damaged, neglected, and i s in dire need o f substantial repairs.&#13;
Currently, a large section o f the city extracts water from hand-dug public and private shallow&#13;
wells. The UNDP estimates that there are more than 5,500 o f these wells, either open or covered&#13;
and equipped with hand-pumps preventing a water crisis.&#13;
37. Between 1990 and 2004 the EC contributed approximately Euro 10 million for maintaining&#13;
the water supply inMonrovia as an emergency support. Duringthat period, the Republic o f China&#13;
contributed another US3.25 million for system rehabilitation. By late 2003, water production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and distribution for around 400,000 inhabitants costed the EC approximately Euro 120,000 per&#13;
month. This expense had become a significant recurring cost for the EC, which had little recourse&#13;
but to continue as the systemwould have collapsed completely ifturned over to the Government.&#13;
This support does not include maintenance and rehabilitation costs o f the water infrastructure and&#13;
equipment that continued to deteriorate. The Liberian Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC), the&#13;
Agency that took over operations from the PUA, has little financial and managerial capacity with&#13;
financial management and accountability beingespecially weak.&#13;
&#13;
38. Inthe midst o f the civil war in 1999, a "Demographic and Health Survey Report" found that&#13;
only 2% o f the households inMonrovia had access to pipe-borne water intheir own dwelling and&#13;
a another 9.3% o f the households had access to pipe-borne water from a public tap or a&#13;
neighboring house. Only 31% o f the households acknowledged having access to safe drinking&#13;
water, with the remaining population depending on shallow wells, springs, ponds or rivers for&#13;
their drinking water. Today, following years o f looting, vandalism and neglect, access to clean&#13;
water i s projected to be lower than in 1999. Monrovia's water treatment plant i s semi-operational&#13;
and the pipe network i s in poor condition. Piped water i s available only in small pockets in&#13;
Bushrod Island in Monrovia. The LWSC reports 560 active water connections including a few&#13;
industrial bulk water consumers and UNMILtankers. The majority o f the 1+ million residents o f&#13;
Monrovia use shallow wells and trucked water delivered at various points throughout the city and&#13;
further re-sold by retail distributors. Monrovia's wastewater treatment plant and all pump stations&#13;
are non-operational. Sewerage and surface water drainage channels and pipes in Monrovia have&#13;
not been cleaned for years.&#13;
&#13;
39. Theft levels and illegal connections to the remaining water supply network are very highand&#13;
add to the already significant amount o f water loss due to system leakage and poor maintenance&#13;
practices. At US$2.35/m3, the price for cash and carry water from the 5 kiosks (3 in Bushrod&#13;
Island and 2 at Paynesville) are considerably higher than that o f house connections, selling water&#13;
at US$0.7/m3. Trucked water i s sold at US$1.6/m3 at origin and re-sold from about US$3.20 to&#13;
9.25/m3 to the end-user (depending on the container size). Based on initial assessments cost&#13;
recovery rate for potable water i s about US$1.19/m3. The current rates show that any&#13;
improvement in the pipe network will lead to a decrease in the average cost o f water, thereby&#13;
improving the general living conditions inLiberia.&#13;
&#13;
C2.2     InstitutionalFramework&#13;
&#13;
40. The LWSC i s responsible for the operation and management o f the water and piped sewerage&#13;
systems. Urban and road drainage fall under the Ministry o f Public Works, while solid waste&#13;
management i s governed by the Monrovia City Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
41. The LWSC has never operated at cost recovery. Before the war, the Government provided a&#13;
subsidy to the LWSC to offset Government obligations, but it was impossible to collect all&#13;
payments due to political interference and low levels o f accountability. Significant losses were&#13;
accumulated. Today, arrears are significant. The utility has accumulated a debt o f US$90&#13;
thousand to local commercial banks to cover operational costs, and approximately US$40 million&#13;
outstanding credit from investors in the 70s. With the exception o f the short-term commercial&#13;
debt (secured with payments from Coca-Cola and the Monrovia Brewery) no strategy for&#13;
repayment exists. Water losses are significant and estimated at 60%. The collection rate i s low at&#13;
42% from the invoiced water. Government stopped subsidizingthe LWSC years ago.&#13;

                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42. Today, the LWSC employs about 150 staff and operates as a vertically integratedstate-owned&#13;
utility. Operations are inefficient, administration and managerial practices are poor. The EC is&#13;
supporting the utility and is providing technical expertise. Many issues remain outstanding e.g.&#13;
financial recovery (collection o f revenues), capacity and overstaffing.&#13;
&#13;
C3        Electricity Sector&#13;
&#13;
C3.1      Overview&#13;
&#13;
43. Liberia's pre-war installed capacity (hydro + thermal) was around 180 M Y , o f which about&#13;
75 MW was for Monrovia. Today, virtually all the infrastructure i s missinginthis sector, having&#13;
been either destroyed or stolen. This includes the country's most cost-effective installation, a 60&#13;
MW hydro plant and associated dam at Mt.Coffee (20 miles from Monrovia). This installation&#13;
is completely destroyed and looted, including one-third of the dam that washed away to the&#13;
streambed.&#13;
&#13;
44. Currently, the entire country is runningon individual diesel generators and a few small run-&#13;
of-river hydro plants, total capacity has been estimated at 50 MW for the whole country. Diesel&#13;
currently costs about $3.20 gallon inLiberia, thus electricity costs about $0.70/kWh-or 10 times&#13;
as much as inmost industrial countries.&#13;
&#13;
C3.2      Institutional Framework&#13;
&#13;
45. The Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) i s responsible for the country's electricity supply&#13;
and distribution. This sector falls under the Ministry o f Lands, Mines, Energy and Environment.&#13;
The LEC i s a state owned enterprise, but has no assets, no customers and no revenues.&#13;
&#13;
46. The LEC currently officially employs about 450 people, or likely 300 too many for its current&#13;
and medium term needs. It i s also highly indebted, at about US$115 million and, with no&#13;
revenue, will stay inthat condition for some time.&#13;
&#13;
C3        Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
C3.1 Transport Sector&#13;
&#13;
47. The Government identified the need for efficient road connections between Monrovia and the&#13;
rest o f the country as central to achieving its reconstruction vision. It was declared a top priority&#13;
because o f its direct impact on security and long-term peace. In addition, by improving road&#13;
accessibility, Government aims to encourage and accelerate the process o f social and economic&#13;
rehabilitation o f the affected populations, provide employment opportunities and field to market&#13;
 access for rural communities. Following the lifting o f the UNsanctions on diamonds and timber,&#13;
the main road corridors linkingupcountry areas with the Port o f Monrovia i s expected to become&#13;
 critical to trade export.&#13;
&#13;
The Government intends to develop a new strategy for the transport sector. This strategy should&#13;
 help address the inadequacy o f budget provisions for road maintenance by exploring&#13;
 opportunities for additional funding through road user charges, the possible establishment o f a&#13;
 dedicated Road Fund as well as the introduction o f efficient management o f the road sub-sector&#13;
 where the intention i s to outsource all maintenance, rehabilitation and construction works to&#13;
 contractors, with the Ministry retaining only a small team o f engineers for quick, emergency&#13;
reaction. The possible introduction o f public private partnerships (PPP) will also be considered,&#13;
 specifically for major road corridors and bridges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C3.2    Water sector&#13;
&#13;
48. InDecember 2004, a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) was signed by the NTGL and&#13;
the EC endorsing a strategy to restore in phases restore the clean water supply to Monrovia in a&#13;
self-sustainable way and at affordable prices. Phase A i s an emergency operation aimed at&#13;
restoring critical infrastructure and providing basic water service to the population o f Monrovia&#13;
while Phase B will focus on sustained liberalization and institutional reform.&#13;
&#13;
49. Under Phase A of the EC-led program, the project will provide funding for both the&#13;
emergency rehabilitationo f the water purification plant at White Plains and the water distribution&#13;
network o f Monrovia, aiming to re-instate production to a quarter o f the pre-conflict level and the&#13;
support the exploration o f and, if found viable, the possible connection o f a potential well field in&#13;
the Paynesville-area. The EC will finance the repair o f the main and some o f the secondary pipe&#13;
lines inMonrovia while the project will finance the repair o f the White Plains purification plant.&#13;
&#13;
C3.3    ElectricitySector&#13;
&#13;
50. The Government i s committed providing centrally generated electricity to Monrovia. In the&#13;
short term Government wants "to turn on the lights" in Monrovia by July 2006, The short term&#13;
Emergency Power Plan (EPP) financed by the European Union, USAID and, through this Project,&#13;
IDA, will assist the Government in achieving this goal.              This program is financed by the&#13;
European Union, USAID and, through this Project, IDA. The US$7 million EPP i s designed to:&#13;
(i)provide street lightinginportions ofMonrovia; and (ii)ifsufficient capacity is available,&#13;
provide electricity to a priority installation, e.g., the capital's principal hospital.&#13;
&#13;
51. The Government i s committed to have a draft sector policy and medium term strategy in&#13;
place by the end o f October 2006. The medium term strategy will determine the mix o f fuel&#13;
sources, as the country has abundant renewable energy potential, including hydro and biomass.&#13;
Achieving integration into the West Africa Power Pool will also be a priority. Policies on cost&#13;
recovery and sector financing will be determined, as well as strategies to place the sector on a&#13;
sound financial footing, includinghow to reduce the unsustainable debt levels inLEC.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Responseof the InternationalCommunity&#13;
&#13;
52. Roads: Almost all major donor agencies active in Liberia have been involved with road&#13;
repairs. For the most part this was limited to very labor intensive activities aiming at employment&#13;
generation and/or ensuring seasonal accessibility to remote areas. These projects were&#13;
implemented either by international and local NGOs or, in the case o f UNMIL military&#13;
engineering battalions. The volume o f required investments to rehabilitate the roads infrastructure&#13;
and achieve tangible results made it difficult for donors to engage in the sector. As a result,&#13;
rehabilitation o f the transport infrastructure on a large scale with the goal o f producing quality&#13;
transport corridors vital to sustained economic development and trade facilitation has yet to be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
53. The two largest international donors in Liberia, the U S and the EC, have to date not&#13;
committed to engagement in rehabilitation o f primary roads. To date both are financing smaller-&#13;
scale projects to repair feeder roads and small bridges only. The EC has recently expressed&#13;
interest to include Liberia as a receiver-country o f their inter-regional transport fund, but specific&#13;
results o f this initiative will not be known for months. Other development partners that are&#13;
usually present in the sector are also focusing on arrears clearance before committing to sectoral&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54. Water: The European Commission (EC) has been subsidizing the sector during the war for&#13;
more than 10 years. In 2004 the EC, as part o f the identification o f emergency activities to re-&#13;
establish running water services to Monrovia, developed the already mentioned phased program&#13;
to reform the water supply inMonrovia.&#13;
&#13;
55. Other development partners have not committed themselves to this sector&#13;
&#13;
56. Electricity: The EC has also been actively supporting the electricity sector for most o f the&#13;
last decade. Currently, it i s leading the donor-funded EPP with USAID and IDA providing&#13;
parallel financing. USAID and IDA will also assist the Government with the medium term sector&#13;
strategies, through both the funding o f expert studies and with contributions from their sectoral&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
                        PART 2.         BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
57. In March 2004, the Bank's Executive Directors discussed a re-engagement strategy for&#13;
Liberia.7This strategy outlined a plan for Bank re-engagement within the RFTF in three priority&#13;
areas: economic management, infrastructure rehabilitation, and community-based development.&#13;
The Bank's strategy envisaged financing from both the L o w Income Countries under Stress&#13;
(LICUS) Trust Fundand a grant from the Bank's surplus. Subsequently, the Board o f Governors&#13;
of the Bank approved the transfer from surplus to a Trust Fundfor Liberia (TFLIB) inthe amount&#13;
of $25 million as a grant to be administered by IDA. Since then, TFLIB and LICUS funds have&#13;
financed       technical assistance for institution building and small scale investments in the three&#13;
priority areas.&#13;
&#13;
58. The Bank will prepare an Interim Strategy Note (ISN), covering the period FY07-08, which&#13;
will be based on the Government's forthcoming development strategy, the Interim Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The I-PRSP will be organized around the four pillars o f the&#13;
LRDC: (i)         Security; (ii)Economic Revitalisation; (iii)Governance and Rule o f Law; and (iv)&#13;
Infrastructureand Basic Services.&#13;
&#13;
59. The proposed project i s in line with the Bank's strategy as articulated in the Country Re-&#13;
Engagement Note which outlined a leadership role for the Bank in the infrastructure sector. The&#13;
project i s also in line with the new administration's expressed request for Bank support in the&#13;
 emergency rehabilitation o f critical transport links. Finally, the project builds on the work&#13;
 financed by the TFLIB - the preparation of technical feasibility studies which prioritized&#13;
 emergency works in five infi-asb-ucture sub-sectors - and the existence o f these studies has greatly&#13;
 facilitated the preparationo f this operation.&#13;
&#13;
 OngoingActivities&#13;
&#13;
 60. The Bank's current program o f activities i s supported primarily through grants from TFLIB&#13;
 ($25 million) and the LICUS Trust Fund ($12 million). The first package o f LICUS Trust Fund&#13;
 grants, approved in March 2004, was designed to target the most critical areas in the immediate&#13;
post-war transition period.         Activities included support for economic governance reforms,&#13;
particularly public financial management and procurement systems; support for a multi-donor&#13;
 reform effort inthe timber sector; quick-impact activities at the community level; and support for&#13;
 donor planning and coordination under the RFTF. The second package o f LICUS Trust Fund&#13;
 grants supports a flexible, quick-disbursing Transition Fund to support Government in key areas&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
of the transition; follow-up support to public procurement reform; and continued support in the&#13;
areas o f economic management and governance.&#13;
&#13;
61. TFLIB has financed a scale-up o f the community-driven reconstruction program (following&#13;
on the LICUS grant); deeper support for governance and public financial management reforms;&#13;
technical assistance to prepare in-depth analysis o f infrastructure needs (which serves as the&#13;
analytic underpinning o f this Project); targeted interventions in the port and airport (through the&#13;
Liberia Emergency Infrastructure Project, currently under preparation); and the establishment o f a&#13;
Global Distance LearningNetwork to bringLiberia into contact with the internationalcommunity&#13;
and to facilitate capacity buildingactivities through the provision o f distance learning.&#13;
&#13;
62. The portfolio i s well aligned with the four pillars o f the Liberia Reconstruction and&#13;
Development Committee (LRDC). As illustrated in Schedule D, the largest share o f program&#13;
resources falls under the pillars o f Economic Revitalization and Infrastructureh3asic Services.&#13;
Multiple Bank networks are active within each pillar, and harmonizationoccurs primarily through&#13;
the field office and visiting missions, so that the dialogue with Government and key international&#13;
partners i s immediately reflected at the level o f project design, resource allocations, and parallel&#13;
financing arrangements. Overall, the LRDC mechanism, with its four working committees and&#13;
"higher" decision-making body chaired by the President, i s beginning to narrow the gap between&#13;
the formulation o f national sector strategies and the donor community's response to the&#13;
challenges inherent intheir implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Liberia'sRelationswiththe Bankandthe IMF&#13;
&#13;
63. Liberia joined the Bank in 1962, received the first o f its 22 IBRDloans in 1964 and the first&#13;
of its 17 IDA credits in 1972. Liberia was a blend country (eligible for both IBRD and IDA&#13;
resources) for ten years until it receivedits last IBRD loan in 1982, two years after a major coup.&#13;
Liberia received its last IDA credit in 1985 following presidential and parliamentary elections,&#13;
but slipped into non-accrual status with the Bank two years later. Since June 1987, Liberia has&#13;
remained innon-accrual status with overdues as of April 30, 2006 amounting to $402 million to&#13;
IBRDand $47 millionto IDA for a total overdue amount o f $449 million. Arrears to the IMFare&#13;
approximately $750 million at end-March 2006 and to the AfDB are about $220 million.&#13;
Liberia's total external debt i s currently estimated at $3.7 billion, equivalent to 3040 percent o f&#13;
 exports on a net present value basis.&#13;
&#13;
 64. Despite this debt situation, the level and quality o f dialogue with the Bretton Woods&#13;
 Institutions improved considerably over the period following elections.          Two IMF missions&#13;
visited Liberia in December 2005 and February 2006. In light o f the initial progress under the&#13;
new Government to strengthen public financial management, the IMF Management approved a&#13;
 Staff Monitored Program (SMP) for the period February-September 2006. The SMP provides a&#13;
 window o f opportunity to make progress toward the eventual resolution o f Liberia's debt&#13;
 overhang. Satisfactory implementation o f the SMP would provide a basis for the Fundto consider&#13;
 the de-escalation of the remedial measures the Fund has imposed on Liberia. Moreover, if&#13;
 sufficient financing assurances and resources for eventual debt relief become available, strong&#13;
 performance under the SMP could form the basis for a subsequent rights accumulation program&#13;
 (RAP), which inturn could lead to a comprehensive arrears clearance operation, a decision point&#13;
 under the HIPC initiative, and eventually to eligibility under the MDRI.'&#13;
&#13;
 'Underthe    current sunset clause o f the enhanced HIPC Initiative, Liberia would need to have&#13;
 started a RAP or a program supported by an IMF financial arrangement by end-December 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65. Early arrears clearance will be important in order to make possible the resumption o f new&#13;
concessional flows from the multilateral development institutions and to bring to bear on&#13;
Liberia's development the full benefits o f a regular relationship with these agencies. A concerted&#13;
effort i s now underway to develop a comprehensive solution to Liberia's arrears problem, and&#13;
Bank staff has been discussing the issues both internally and with partners over the last several&#13;
months. A key underlying principle o f any approach will be that all arrears to multilateral&#13;
creditors will be cleared within a reasonable timeframe within the context o f a concerted&#13;
international effort to provide sufficient new financing to Liberia.&#13;
&#13;
66. Once Liberia's arrears to the Bank are cleared, it is expected that the country will be eligible&#13;
to receive a post-conflict IDA allocation o f approximately $35 million per fiscal year. The use o f&#13;
these resources will be determined based on the dialogue between Government, the Bank and&#13;
other partners around the needs identified by the I-PRSP and the areas o f comparative advantage&#13;
that each partner brings.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for Early IDA Assistance&#13;
&#13;
67. The proposed grant o f $30 millionwill allow the Bank to provide timely assistance to Liberia&#13;
inthe criticalperiodbeforearrears are cleared andregular IDAfinancingbecomes available. The&#13;
physical devastation wrought by decades o f civil war i s far reaching and complete. It i s crucial&#13;
that the Government demonstrate early and concrete results to a population that has been&#13;
disillusioned by years o f corruption and mismanagement o f public funds. The proposed project&#13;
will support the emergency repair o f the primary road network and will assist Government in&#13;
strengthening the road management functions in the Ministry o f Public Works.              It will also&#13;
support the emergency repair o f the water purification plant and distribution network and will&#13;
contribute the sustainable implementation o f the emergency power project initiated under the&#13;
Government's 150-day plan. In this way, this project will both show results on the ground as&#13;
well as contribute to building up the implementation capacity o f the sectoral ministries. In sum,&#13;
this operation could make a significant contribution to consolidating the current window of&#13;
opportunity into a genuine move to stability and sustainable economic growth, which would have&#13;
a positive impact not only inLiberia but inthe entire sub-region.&#13;
&#13;
LegalBasisfor Assistance to a Non-Accrual Member&#13;
&#13;
 68. Beginning with the IDA12 Replenishment, IDA donor funds may be used for grants in the&#13;
context o f assistance to post-conflict countries under a framework approved by the Executive&#13;
Directors in July 2001'.    According to this framework, the following conditions need to be met:&#13;
 (i) proposedgranthasbeendesignedinaccordancewithOP2.30; (ii)earlyperformanceis&#13;
    the&#13;
promising as evidenced by the recipient country having taken convincing steps towards social and&#13;
 economic recovery; (iii)   arrears to IBRD and/or IDA are large and protracted, and cannot be&#13;
 easily or quickly cleared usingdomestic resources; (iv) a concerted international effort to provide&#13;
positive financial flows and other assistance i s underway, and other creditors have agreed not to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The use o f pre-arrears clearance grants was provided for in section 9 o f Resolution No. IDA 194,&#13;
 "Additions to IDA Resources: Twelfth Replenishment, A Partnership for Poverty Reduction", adopted&#13;
 April 8, 1999. See also paragraphs 38 and 44 o f the IDA12 Replenishment report (IDNR98-195).       The&#13;
 IDA12 Resolution specifies that such grants should be used "under a framework approved by the Executive&#13;
 Directors." Such a framework was detailed inparagraph 25 of the project documentation for the first IDA&#13;
pre-arrears clearance grant to the Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC). See "Democratic Republic o f&#13;
 Congo: Emergency Early Recovery Project", IDA Report No: P 7469 ZR. The framework and the grant to&#13;
 DRCwere approved on July 9, 2001.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
make net withdrawals of financial resources from the country; and (v) alternative sources o f&#13;
financing for post-conflict recovery are inadequate or available only on inappropriate terms.&#13;
&#13;
69. With respect to condition (i), objectives, terms and conditions o f the proposed operation&#13;
                                     the&#13;
are consistent with OP 2.30, the Guideline on Operational Development and Conflict. With&#13;
respect to condition (ii), recent performance o f the Government (see paragraphs 7-8) and the&#13;
                           the&#13;
agreement o n an IMF SMP, justify Bank involvement from this standpoint. With respect to&#13;
condition (iii),  Liberia has been in non-accrual since 1987, and total arrears to IBRD and IDA&#13;
amount to nearly $450 million, which compares to a GDP o f approximately $500 million in2005.&#13;
With respect to condition (iv), a concerted effort is being made to provide positive financial flows&#13;
and other assistance to the new Government as it tackles the enormous challenges left behind by&#13;
the war. At the same time, the IMF and the AfDB require that monthly good faith payments be&#13;
made by Liberia as part of their arrears clearance strategy, but this i s in conflict with the Bank`s&#13;
framework for the use of Pre-Arrears Clearance IDA grants innon-accrualcountries. The issue i s&#13;
still under discussion. Shortly before the Board discussion, Management would update EDs on&#13;
the status o f discussions with the IMF and AfDB. Finally, condition (v) i s met because the&#13;
amounts available from alternative sources prior to arrears clearance are not sufficient to meet&#13;
Liberia's needs.&#13;
&#13;
                     PART3.           DETAILED PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
A.       ProjectDevelopment Objectives&#13;
&#13;
70. The Project will, on an emergency basis, assist Government to reconstruct parts o f the&#13;
devastated infrastructure. These actions will help revive the economy and reintegrate the country&#13;
by restoring vital transport links throughout the country. It will also support the improvement of&#13;
living conditions inthe capital, Monrovia, byrestoringand expandingbulkwater supply services.&#13;
&#13;
71. The development objective o f the project i s to provide Government with emergency support&#13;
to restore priority infrastructure. This will support, over the next four years, the repair o f about&#13;
465 km o f primary roads on both the Monrovia-Buchanan and Monrovia-Ganta-Guinea border&#13;
routes, construction o f about 6 bridges and the repair o f about 65 bridges on the same routes,&#13;
reinstating potable water production for Monrovia by increasing the capacity o f the White Plains&#13;
treatment plant, from the current     lo%,  to about 25% o f its design capacity and supporting an&#13;
emergency electricity generation program in Monrovia by providing the necessary fuel for&#13;
generation duringthe first one to two years. The project will also support the strengthening o f the&#13;
capacity o f Government inboth the transport sector by re-instating and strengthening the MPW's&#13;
management functions in roads development and maintenance. The project will also support&#13;
institutional strengthening o f the LWSC through improving its revenue collection and metering&#13;
responsibilities. This objective i s consistent with the current Government's reconstruction agenda&#13;
and i s fully aligned with the objectives o f the ongoing support under TFLIB.&#13;
&#13;
72. The project will support emergency activities that can be completed in a short period o f time&#13;
and will also assist with the provision o f a basis for the re-instatement o f all roads infrastructure&#13;
in Liberia through future support. It will help with poverty reduction among rural and urban&#13;
populations by creating short-term employment opportunities associated with the works contracts&#13;
and by improving rural access through reduced travel time and reduced transport costs o f food&#13;
from producers to the market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.        ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
73. The project comprises two components: (a) emergency rehabilitation and repair o f critical&#13;
infrastructure; and, (b) strengthening institutional capacity. IDA'Ssupport will be utilised as set&#13;
out in Table 3 below. The summarised cost o f the components i s US$ 27.85 million. Due to the&#13;
nature o f the project allowance for contingencies o f US$ 2.15 million (about 7.2 % o f the project&#13;
cost) i s provided for.&#13;
&#13;
74. Component 1:Emergency rehabilitation and repair of Critical Infrastructure (US$ 24.95&#13;
million, excluding contingencies): This will support the repair o f the following primary roads;&#13;
Monrovia-Buchanan, linking the two largest population centres, and Monrovia-Gbanga-Ganta-&#13;
Guinea border, linkingMonrovia with the interior o f Liberia and with one neighbouring country,&#13;
On these same road links the project will support the construction of at least 6 major bridges and&#13;
the repair o f a further 65. These road links were already identified and selected during the Joint&#13;
Needs Exercise, jointly undertaken with the UNDP in 2003, as the most critical routes for&#13;
strategic, commercial and accessibility reasons. From the detailed assessments undertaken under&#13;
TFLIB, the extent of the emergency repairs was identifiedwith the works as well as the 6 bridges&#13;
forming part of the emergency activities. It will support the improvement o f potable water supply&#13;
to Monrovia through the emergency rehabilitation o f the White Plains purification plant and the&#13;
testing and potential development o f additional groundwater resources at Paynesville. This&#13;
component will also support the EPP by providing fuel and managing fuel supply to the&#13;
generating sets soon to be installed in Monrovia. This component would also allow for&#13;
supervision and additional design activities associated with the works. The detailed activities are&#13;
as follows;&#13;
&#13;
Roads: Under TFLIB the Bank supported the assessment o f priority primary road links between&#13;
Monrovia and Buchanan (220km) and Monrovia and Ganta and the Guinea border (265 km).&#13;
These road links are critical to normalise transport between the two largest towns in Liberia and&#13;
betweenMonrovia and the interior.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed support, estimated at $22.5 million, includes the following sub-components;&#13;
 0   Emergency works identified include road and drainage repairs and the reconstruction o f&#13;
     several bridges damaged duringthe war. This will be undertaken in two distinct civil works&#13;
     packages, one for each road link. Each package includes road works related to pavement&#13;
     repairs,  drainage repairs and other        associated works. A substantial number o f&#13;
     crossingsfbridges will be included in each road package; package one about 30 and package&#13;
     two about 38 crossingshridges.&#13;
&#13;
 0   Reconstruction o f major bridges: These include six bridges on the Monrovia-White Plains-&#13;
     Careysburg-road and on the Gbanga-Ganta-road as shown in the Table below. These sites&#13;
     include river crossings that are completely washed away with the communities and social&#13;
     services cut off from the rest of Liberia for large parts o f the year. Once the bridges are re-&#13;
     instated, the traffic flows and access can normalise to the pre-war levels o f service. These&#13;
     bridges will be undertaken under a separate civil works package.&#13;

Inorder to speed upthis reconstruction, the bridgepackagewill be based on the designandbuild&#13;
method. During the conceptual design stage all six bridges listed above will be included in the&#13;
study while, initially, only the last five bridges are at this stage included for implementation&#13;
(construction and supervision).&#13;
&#13;
Water: The proposed support, estimated to about US$2.4 million, will include the following&#13;
sub-components:&#13;
0   Emergency support to rehabilitate the White Plains treatment plant and its operation (surface&#13;
    water source from St. Paul River) to increase its production capacity to about 5 MGD and&#13;
    will also include the rehabilitation o f the second primary pipe line (900 mm diameter) to&#13;
    assure delivery o f potable water to the ringpipe line o f Monrovia,&#13;
0   Development o f groundwater resources, at Paynesville, east o f Monrovia, by exploring a&#13;
    possibility for development o f a major aquifer. It will include: (i)       additional geophysical&#13;
    investigations, (ii) drilling o f an initial 2 pilot boreholes, with the intention o f transforming&#13;
    them into production wells and construction o f two piezometers, and (iii)      supervision o f the&#13;
    drilling activities (boreholes and piezometers),&#13;
0   Support the improvement o f the existing and supplementary distribution network so as to&#13;
    increase distribution o f piped potable water to an increasednumber o f consumers.&#13;
&#13;
The full investigation and study o f the pilot boreholes with piezometer monitoringwill take about&#13;
12- 18 months. The final goal o f the investigations would be to determine the capacity o f the&#13;
aquifer while the piezometers will monitor any future sea water intrusion. The preliminary&#13;
geophysical investigations will be carried out in the suggested area at Paynesville, east o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Monrovia where the Paynesville and Edina Sandstones are outcropping. This area, located close&#13;
to the two existing "deep wells" and the 36" main pipeline from White Plains, i s the main&#13;
potential for future groundwater exploitation.&#13;
&#13;
Electricity: Under the Emergency Power Program, four diesel-powered electricity generating sets&#13;
will be procured, shipped to Monrovia, and installed at two key sites in Monrovia as shown in&#13;
Table 4. The Congotown site will need to be rehabilitated and prepared to serve as a secure site&#13;
for the generating sets prior to their arrival. The Krutown site will also need some preparatory&#13;
work. Together the two power stations are to provide about 1.2 million kWhper month.&#13;
&#13;

Expectedto supply 674,520 kWh/mo                    Expectedto supply 408,800 kWh/mo&#13;
&#13;
For transmission and distribution, selected medium voltage (22/11 kV) and low voltage (400/230&#13;
V) lines radiating out from the substations will be installed - poles, cables, insulators and&#13;
transformers. The current work program calls for 6 kilometers o f medium-voltage lines and 9&#13;
kilometers o f low-voltage lines to be rehabilitated for each o f the two substations. A survey will&#13;
determine the precise line routes. A maximum o f twenty kilometers o f streetlights will be&#13;
installed and operated along selected streets and within several l o w income areas o f Monrovia.&#13;
The city's mainhospital, JFK Hospital, may also be connected.&#13;
&#13;
For the Congotown and Krutown generating sets, fuel will be a major on-going procurement&#13;
activity, Together, they will need about US$275,000 indiesel fuel per month intotal. The project&#13;
will support this activity through co-financing some o f the fuel purchases, estimated to be about&#13;
US$2,350,000 in total This requires putting in place a fuel supply contract, installing sufficient&#13;
 storage tanks (4 day supply) at the generating set sites, and providing adequate security to prevent&#13;
theft or delay o f the fuel supplies. Detailed procurement and security arrangements for fuel are&#13;
necessarily complex and, therefore, are still under discussion among the EPP financiers and the&#13;
 Government.&#13;
&#13;
 75. Component 2: Strengthening Institutional Capacity                (US$2.9 million,     excluding&#13;
 contingencies): This will support several activities all focused on strengthening Government's&#13;
 capacity to carry out its road management and maintenance functions while also supporting a&#13;
 strategy to define methods to improve the efficiency o f bulk water supply to Monrovia. This&#13;
 would include capacity building, core equipment purchases and provision o f support systems to&#13;
 operationalise the Ministry.MPW intends to perform all maintenance tasks by contract. This will&#13;
 not be achieved 100% within the next three years. Therefore, all equipment purchases would be&#13;
based on improving the contract supervision functions with only limited core maintenance&#13;
 equipment included.&#13;
&#13;
 76. This component would also support the strengthening o f the project management, monitoring&#13;
 and evaluation functions through the financing o f technical assistance to the Special&#13;
 Implementation Unit (SlU), assuring smooth project implementation, consistent supervision and&#13;
 management o f all activities as well as monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness o f the project.&#13;
 It will also support the establishment of the PFMU inthe MOF to be established by the MOF. It&#13;
&#13;
                                                 22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will also include short term support to re-establish basic management systems inMPW.This will&#13;
also include a study to classify the road network and determine its condition as a basis for longer&#13;
term maintenance planning and budgeting. It will support the GOL efforts for optimization o f&#13;
services and management o f the sector. This will also include the strengthening o f the LWSC by&#13;
supporting their revenue collection and metering maintenance functions and support for a&#13;
comprehensive study for optimization o f the management o f the water sub-sector, improvement&#13;
of operations and associated activities and the design o f options for private public partnership in&#13;
the sector.&#13;
&#13;
C.       ProjectProgram,EstimatedCosts andFinancing&#13;
&#13;
77. The project i s designed to support emergency activities that will be completed over 3 years&#13;
covering the next two dry seasons. It i s expected that contractors will move to site at the end o f&#13;
the current wet seasonnamely, in September/October 2006.&#13;
&#13;
78. The project will contribute US$30 million in support o f the Liberian reconstruction program,&#13;
This will only provide support to undertake a part ofthe emergency works inall the infrastructure&#13;
sectors identified with the TFLIB-studies estimated in excess o f US$ 75 million. GOL informed&#13;
the Bank that the focus o f the support should be emergency activities in the roads, water and&#13;
electricity sectors with some allocations for the strengthening o f the MPW. The rehabilitation of&#13;
water infrastructurewithin Component 1i s part o f a larger EC-led program to provide emergency&#13;
water supply to Monrovia and reformthe sector. The EC's contribution to the parallel emergency&#13;
activities i s estimated at US$ 3.6 million (Euro 3.0 million). Similarly, the support for the&#13;
electricity sector i s infull integration with the EC-ledand USAID-supported EPP. Table 5 gives a&#13;
breakdown o f the agreed support by component.&#13;

                   PART 4.          IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.      ProjectManagementandImplementation&#13;
&#13;
79. Project implementation period The project will be implemented from July 1, 2006 to June&#13;
30,2010.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Capacityof Governmentto implementthe project&#13;
&#13;
80. Capacity o f the Government to implement a project o f this magnitude i s weak at this stage.&#13;
The new Government i s committed to better performance and transparency and endorsed the Act&#13;
creating the Public Procurement Commission. This Act was drafted under the Bank's TFLIB-&#13;
project and closely follows the Bank's own Procurement Guidelines. Government has further&#13;
agreed on the implementation arrangements for the project to compensate for the current&#13;
weaknesses and to strengthen its capacity to implement future projects. These are described&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
C.      ProjectImplementationandManagement Structure&#13;
&#13;
81. Project oversight: A Steering Committee, chaired by the Deputy Minister responsible for&#13;
Technical Services of the MPW, and consisting of a maximum o f seven members including,&#13;
amongst others, representatives o f the Infrastructure and Basic Services Pillar, MOF, MOT,&#13;
Ministry o f Planning, LEC and the LWSC, will be responsible for overall project oversight and&#13;
policy guidance.&#13;
&#13;
82. Project management: Given the urgent nature o f the project, the short time frame for&#13;
implementation and the limited capacity o f Government, the following institutional arrangements&#13;
have been agreed to ensure that funds disburse quickly with manageable implementation risks,&#13;
objectives are reached and absolute transparency i s maintained.&#13;
&#13;
83. Government decided to centralise the financial management tasks associated with donor&#13;
projects in one Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) in the Ministry o f Finance. This&#13;
project and LIRF'will be the first two Bank projects to support this planned initiative. The Special&#13;
ImplementationUnit (SIU) will be set up in such a way that, the relevant financial management&#13;
responsibilities are to be established inthe PFMU.&#13;
&#13;
84. MPW will implement the Project through the creation o f the S I U and staffed with a&#13;
combination o f competent M P W staff and selected technical assistance. The SIU, managed by a&#13;
competent full-time project coordinator/unit manager (a high level senior Government official to&#13;
be appointed or a project management specialist to be recruited), with qualifications and&#13;
experience acceptable to the Bank, will include as key staff: Engineers from the road and water&#13;
sectors, Financial Management Specialist, Procurement Specialist and, on an as and when&#13;
required basis, both an Environmental Expert and a Transport Economist. The S I U will have&#13;
basic financial management capacity to support the requirements o f the PFMU that will be&#13;
responsible for all financial management tasks.&#13;
&#13;
85. Memorandum of Understanding:Coordination between the S I U and the PFMUwill be based&#13;
on a Memorandum of Understanding, signed, within six months after achieving effectiveness,&#13;
between the M P W and the MOF, defining the responsibilities o f and levels o f service required&#13;
from both parties. The PFMU will have a unit manager with international accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
qualifications acceptable to the Bank, project accountant and an internal auditor.&#13;
&#13;
86. The coordinator will have direct communication with the Team Leader and will be&#13;
responsible for day-to-day management o f the project. The SIU will have an appropriate skills&#13;
mix, including technical, project management, fiduciary as well as environmental and safeguard&#13;
skills to carry out its functions. In particular, the S I U will be responsible for: a) assuring steady&#13;
progress of the procurement in accordance with annual work plans and accompanying reviewed&#13;
and approved by the World Bank, b) ensuring satisfactory implementation o f activities included&#13;
inall contracts, c) ensuring that ahighethical standard andtransparency ismaintained throughout&#13;
the entire project implementation, d) preparing the quarterly interimunaudited financial reports&#13;
(IFR), and, e) monitoring and evaluating performance indicators andresults.&#13;
&#13;
87. The MPW at negotiations confirmed that the key Government staff o f the S I U and PFMU&#13;
would be inplace by end June 2006 when Government will by end June 2006 appoint, on a short&#13;
term basis, individual consultants with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank, to&#13;
support the procurement and financial management activities associated with the project. This&#13;
arrangement may cease when the longer term technical assistance required for project&#13;
management, procurement and financial management has been recruited. Procurement o f the&#13;
longer term appointments i s already well advanced.&#13;
&#13;
88. The MPW has not been functioning as a proper Ministry for many years and the S I U would&#13;
be usedto assist with re-establishing the functions inthe MPW. Also, Government has structured&#13;
itself into four basic pillars to manage service delivery. The MPW, as chair o f the Infrastructure&#13;
and Basic Services Pillar, intends to build on the capacity developed by the SIU, to extend its&#13;
capacity to implement projects across all sectors under this pillar.&#13;
&#13;
89. Interim implementation arrangements: Given the urgent nature o f the project and the need to&#13;
time the start o f construction works immediately after the rainy season (October, 2006),&#13;
procurement activities should commence prior to the planned approval o f the proposed Project.&#13;
MPW and MOF have minimal internal resources and capacity to undertake these tasks on their&#13;
O W .&#13;
&#13;
90. For the S I U the immediate steps prior to effectiveness include the appointment o f the project&#13;
coordinator and a procurement specialist who will manage the initial start-up tasks and the initial&#13;
procurement activities. These SIU members could be appointed either from existing staff o f&#13;
Government or as consultants and will have qualifications and experience satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
91, For the PFMU the immediate steps prior to effectiveness would be to appoint an accountant&#13;
who, assisted by the Bank-supported technical assistance in the MOF, will be responsible for the&#13;
initial financial management tasks. This will include the opening o f the PPF designated account at&#13;
a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank and the processing o f all payment requests o f the SIU.&#13;
&#13;
 92. The remainder o f the staff for both the S I U and the PFMU should be inplace within 6 months&#13;
 after effectiveness. This will ensure that these units are fully operational by then. These&#13;
 appointments will serve as a condition o f disbursement. The Bank shall review progress made in&#13;
the establishment of both units and no more than the equivalent o f US$ 3.O million equivalent can&#13;
be disbursed from the grant account prior to achieving complete establishment. Government will&#13;
 achieve this by appointing the following staff to the SIU; Engineers from the road and water&#13;
 sectors and Financial Management Specialist, and to the PFMU; unit manager and an internal&#13;
 auditor. These staff shall all have qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93, Project Preparation Facility (PPF): To assist with project preparation and start-up,&#13;
Government applied for PPF-funding to be used as "bridging" financing to Liberia between the&#13;
time o f grant approval by the IDA Board and project effectiveness, which may take several&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
94. The governing policies (OPBP 8.10 re PPF and O P B P 13.40 re suspension o f&#13;
disbursements) generally preclude provision o f PPFs to countries in arrears. (Para 9(b) o f OP&#13;
8.10 provides for PPF suspension in the event o f suspension in any other loadcredit to a given&#13;
country (which would be the case when dealing with a country in arrears) and footnote 2 to OP&#13;
13.20, governing suspension, defines "loans" to include PPF advances--which means that the&#13;
general prohibition on extending new "loans" to countries in arrears applies to PPF advances. The&#13;
special framework for pre-arrears clearance grants to post-conflict countries inlimited conditions&#13;
(established under IDA12 agreement and included inIDA13 and IDA14 agreements) under which&#13;
this Liberia grant is being processed, has not been specifically extended to the PPF instrument.&#13;
Under the present fkamework, authorizing a PPF would therefore require a waiver to the&#13;
provisions o f OP 8.10 and OP 13.40.&#13;
&#13;
95, The management o f the Bank provided such a waiver based on (a) Liberia's short-term needs&#13;
for the bridge financing inthe next few months in connection with urgent repairs that form part o f&#13;
the project, and (b) the adjunct nature o f the PPF instrument (Le,, being an advance to the grant, it&#13;
would be logical to authorize it within the same framework that applies to the pre-arrears&#13;
clearance grant itself under IDA 14). This waiver made Board approval o f the grant itself a&#13;
condition o f disbursement o f the PPF.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Procurement andDisbursementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
96. Procurement: Procurement o f works, goods, and services will follow the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines o f May 2004. The thresholds for the use o f different procurement methods are&#13;
presented in a Technical Annex. The thresholds for prior review by the Bank o f the Recipient's&#13;
procurement decisions are specified in the procurement plan. These thresholds have been set&#13;
relatively low to reduce the procurement risk, which i s considered high. About 95% o f the total&#13;
value of the project would be subject to prior review.&#13;
&#13;
97. All procurement will be handled by the SIU. It will prepare the initial requirements for&#13;
procurement (terms o f reference, bills o f quantities, specifications, etc.), will be responsible for&#13;
the procurement process up to award o f contract and will thereafter also manage these contracts.&#13;
The current procurement capacity in the MPW is low and Government decided, as part o f the&#13;
establishment o f the SIU, to have in place, by effectiveness, sufficiently qualified procurement&#13;
staff to undertake these activities.&#13;
&#13;
98. The two Bank projects currently under preparation will contribute on a pro-rata basis toward&#13;
the runningo fthe PFMU. The project will therefore make annual allocations to the PFMUto help&#13;
cover the initial establishment costs, the recruitment o f external skills, training o f Government&#13;
staff and operational costs. The total estimated funding for the PFMU i s calculated as about&#13;
$1.30 million for its first three years o f the project. This assumption i s based on the fact that by&#13;
then a large part o f the project would be completed and the fundingresponsibility would either be&#13;
taken over by new projects, post-arrears clearance, or be decreased substantially. The Table&#13;
below gives a breakdown of these costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  27&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99. These costs are divided between the project and LIRP on a pro-rata basis related to the&#13;
estimated project amounts. Assuming that no projects will be approved during the next three&#13;
years the project would at maximum allocate.US$ 880,000 while LIRP will contribute the&#13;
remaining US$ 420,000 towards the US$1.3 million. However, there i s considerable evidence&#13;
that both Government and the Bank wants to clear the arrears making normalised Bank support to&#13;
Liberia possible. Should this happen in FYO8 the project's requirement to funding o f the PFMU&#13;
should decrease by as much as US$300,000 equivalent during the last two years. The project&#13;
therefore conservatively allocates US$160,000 towards funding additional emergency assistance,&#13;
Should the project, at the time o f the mid-term review, still be required to provide the full amount&#13;
o f US$880,000, a reallocationwould be made to provide for the actual requirements from project&#13;
savings.&#13;
&#13;
100.    The draft Procurement Plan for the first 12 months included inthe Technical Annex will&#13;
be discussed and agreed upon soon after the appointment o f the S I U project coordinator and the&#13;
procurement specialist. The Procurement Plan would be finalized within 2 months after&#13;
effectiveness. Emergency projects are usually associated with special procurement arrangements,&#13;
This project does not require these with the most urgent engineering studies either nearly&#13;
complete or under procurement.&#13;
&#13;
101.    Disbursement: All costs are exclusive o f taxes and duties. Government provided a letter&#13;
to the Bank confirming that all activities, goods, services and consulting services will be exempt&#13;
from all taxes and levies imposed inLiberia duringthe duration o f project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
102.    In light of the cash flow difficulties facing Liberia Government is not in a position to&#13;
provide counterpart funding for the envisaged project activities. Along with this submission the&#13;
Board i s therefore requested to approve a waiver for the project to allow that all activities&#13;
supported by the project will be funded 100% from the proceeds o f the Grant. This i s in line with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a previous decision o f the Board when, on August 25,2004, it approved the establishment o f the&#13;
current Trust Fund for Liberia (TFLIB). In the absence of country financing parameters (CFP),&#13;
the Board then approved that the proceeds o f TFLIB finance eligible expenditures at 100% in&#13;
light o f the cash flow difficulties facing Liberia.&#13;
&#13;
103.      During the interim period the PFMU shall, as far as in practicable, utilise the direct&#13;
payment method to minimize payments from the designatedaccount.&#13;
&#13;
104.      Designated Account: The project will have one Designated Account opened in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank and will be operated by the PFMU in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's operational guidelines. The Designated Account ceiling i s US$1.O million. Direct&#13;
payments may be made from the Grant Account.&#13;
&#13;
E.        FinancialManagement Arrangements and Audits&#13;
&#13;
105,      Internal controls andfinancial management manual: The project's internal controls (both&#13;
for the S I U and the PFMU) will be documented in a financial management manual. The&#13;
procedures used by the project to maintain its records will also be laid out herein. The manual&#13;
will include requirements for cross references to supporting documentation in the statements of&#13;
expenditure in order to facilitate the audit o f these expenditures and improve the maintenance o f&#13;
the project's records. The PFMU, in consultation with the SIU, will update the manual regularly&#13;
to take into account any changes inprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
106.      The manual will describe the accounting system: the major transaction cycles, funds flow&#13;
processes, the accounting records, supporting documents, computer files and specific accounts in&#13;
the financial statements; the list of accounting codes used to group transactions (chart o f&#13;
accounts); the accounting processes from the initiation o f a transaction to its inclusion in the&#13;
financial statements; authorization procedures for transactions; the financial reporting process&#13;
used to prepare the financial statements, including significant accounting estimates and&#13;
disclosures; financial and accounting policies for the project; budgeting procedures; financial&#13;
forecasting procedures; procurement and contract administration monitoring procedures;&#13;
procedures undertaken for the replenishment o f the Designated Account; and auditing&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
 107.     Planning and budgeting: Cash budget preparation will follow Government procedures,&#13;
Detailed procedures for planning and budgeting will be documented inthe financial management&#13;
manual. Financial projections or forecasts for the life o f the projects (analyzed by year) will be&#13;
prepared, On an annual basis, the project accountants will prepare the cash budget for the coming&#13;
period based on the work program. The cash budget should include the figures for the year,&#13;
analyzed by quarter. The cash budget for each quarter will reflect the detailed specifications for&#13;
project activities, schedules (including procurement plan), and expenditure on project activities&#13;
scheduled respectively for the quarter. The annual cash budget will be sent to the Bank at least&#13;
two months before the beginning o f the project fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
 108.     Accountingpolicies: IDA funds will be accounted for by the project on a cash basis. This&#13;
will be augmented with appropriate records and procedures to track commitments and to&#13;
 safeguard assets. The accounting records will be maintained in dual currencies on a computerized&#13;
 system. The books of accounts will include a cash book, ledgers, journal vouchers, a fixed asset&#13;
register, and a contracts register. The books o f accounts to be used for the project will be opened&#13;
and a chart o f accounts will be completed by project negotiation. Annual financial statements will&#13;
be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards. All accounting and control&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procedures will be documented in the financial management manual, and will be regularly&#13;
updated by the PFMU, in consultation with the SIU.&#13;
&#13;
109.     Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRS): Within two months after project&#13;
effectiveness, the quarterly IFR produced by the project will be reviewed by the Bank. The S I U&#13;
will be responsible for the preparation o f the IFR with the PFMU providing the Financial&#13;
Management Report and the S I U responsible for the progress and procurement management&#13;
reports. Adequate capacity inboth the PFMUand S I U should facilitate the production o f the IFR.&#13;
&#13;
110.     Internal audit: The internal auditor needs to be a certified accountant with relevant&#13;
experience with donor-financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
111.     External audits: The Government will recruit external auditors under terms o f reference&#13;
and experience acceptable to IDA no later than nine months following effectiveness o f the&#13;
project. Any firm o f auditors contracted to carry out the audit should meet the Bank's&#13;
requirements interms o f independence, qualifications, and experience.&#13;
&#13;
112.     The external audit will cover all Bank funds. Consolidated audited project accounts&#13;
should be produced, taking into consideration the new audit policy guidelines o f the Bank. The&#13;
format to be adopted will be documented in the financial management manual. Besides&#13;
expressing a primary opinion on the audited financial statements in compliance with international&#13;
accounting standards, the audit report should be submitted to IDA within six months after the end&#13;
o f each financial year. The auditor will be required to prepare a separate management letter&#13;
giving observations and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements of&#13;
accounting records, systems, controls and compliance with financial covenants in the Financing&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
113.     It was agreed with Government that to establish an acceptable control environment andto&#13;
mitigate risks, two main actions are necessary within six months o f achieving effectiveness: (a)&#13;
Drafting `and adoption o f a fully documented Financial Management Manual which covers&#13;
financial  policies and procedures, accounting and internal control system, financial reporting,&#13;
flow of funds and auditing arrangements; and (b) installation o f an integrated accounting&#13;
software, including data testing. Given the fact that a financial management specialist will be part&#13;
of the SIU, these actions are not conditions for disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
The Government may retain for a short period the services o f a specialized firm to install the&#13;
financial management system, prepare the manual o fprocedures and provide initial training to the&#13;
staff of the PFMUand the financial section o f the SIU.&#13;
&#13;
F.       AdditionalConditionsof Effectivenessand Conditionsof Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
 114.     Conditions of effectiveness: In summary, the project has the following additional&#13;
conditions o f effectiveness:&#13;
          a. The S I U has been established under terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
         the Project Coordinator and the procurement specialist appointed, under terms of&#13;
         reference and with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank, from either&#13;
          existing staff o f the Recipient or recruitedunder the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, and,&#13;
         b. The PFMUhas been established under terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
          an accountant appointed, under terms o f reference and with qualifications and experience&#13;
          that are acceptable to the Bank, from either existing staff of the Recipient or recruited&#13;
          under the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115.      Conditions of Disbursement: In summary the project has the following conditions o f&#13;
disbursement;&#13;
          a. Until Government fully established both the S I U and the PFMUit would have access&#13;
          to US$3.0 million o f the grant only. Government will achieve this by appointing the&#13;
          following staff to the SIU; Engineers from the road and water sectors and Financial&#13;
          Management Specialist, and to the PFMU; unit manager and an internal auditor. These&#13;
          staff shall all have qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
          b. No withdrawal shall be made for payments made prior to the date o f the project&#13;
          Financing Agreement beingsigned&#13;
          c. No withdrawal shall be made for works under Category 1 unless the Recipient has&#13;
          submitted to the Bank an Environmental Management Plan and Resettlement Action&#13;
          Plan, as the case may be, that i s satisfactory to the Bank and disclosed the said document&#13;
          insuchmanner as mayberequiredbythe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
G.        Supervision&#13;
&#13;
116.      The Bank will devote an average o f 22 staff weeks per year to supervise the project, and a&#13;
total o f 90 staff weeks through fiscal 2010 in order to ensure smooth implementation in an&#13;
environment with a lack o f bothprofessional knowledge and knowledge related to Bank-financed&#13;
projects. This i s also a measure to mitigate the identified substantial risks related to possible&#13;
mismanagement. During the first year, supervision will focus on performance o f the S I U in&#13;
managing contracts, procurement, and financial matters, as well as in completing the agreed&#13;
implementation plan. Duringthe following years, supervision will focus on progress inexecuting&#13;
works and strengthening the capacity o f Government.&#13;
&#13;
H.        Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
117.      The project will be based on the results-based approach. Key performance indicators,&#13;
specified for each project component, were agreed at negotiations. The project focuses on a small&#13;
number o f indicators only, given the generally weak institutional capacity that currently exists.&#13;
Table 7 below sets out the specific indicators which monitor the impact o f the project while&#13;
Schedule A provides more detail. Monitoring o f contracts implementation will be assured by the&#13;
staff o f the SIU. Progress towards achieving o f these key performance indicators will be reviewed&#13;
regularly by World Bank.&#13;

118.     The selected indicators are simple and most o fthe data already exist. The S I U will collect&#13;
the data on a regular basis (monthly, semi-annually and annually depending on the regularity o f&#13;
the reporting). The average reduction in travel time will be determined as part o f the works&#13;
contracts on these road links. At the commencement o f the contracts, the travel times will be&#13;
measured to determine the baseline data. The same measurement will be undertaken throughout&#13;
the duration o f the project to determine the actual savings achieved.&#13;
&#13;
119.     Reviews: In addition to intensive additional supervision by Bank staff, reviews to assess&#13;
progress in implementing the agreed activities will be carried out during at least two Bank&#13;
supervision missions together with Government and all supporting cooperatingpartners. This will&#13;
be part o f the Government-donor coordination process. The steering committee, through the SIU,&#13;
will be responsible for preparing the necessary documentation for the reviews and for planning&#13;
the review meetings.&#13;
&#13;
120.     A midterm review will be carried out 24 months after project effectiveness to assess&#13;
progress under the project, achievement o f overall objectives and to eventually reorient the&#13;
project if needed to ensure that it achieves its objectives. As appropriate, the Government will&#13;
contract a consultant (under project finance) to review and assess progress in implementing the&#13;
project and to assist in preparing the necessary documentation for the review. The steering&#13;
committee through the S I U will be responsible for preparing the necessary documentation for the&#13;
review and for planning the midterm review meeting. The midterm review will evaluate progress&#13;
in reaching the project and program objectives, and will identify measures to improve&#13;
performance if needed. Careful attention will be paid to the performance o f the involved entities&#13;
in addressing environmental and social issues and in designing and implementing the various&#13;
&#13;

activities. Specialists will assess the environmental and social impacts o f investments, both&#13;
individually and cumulatively, and the adequacy o f safeguard procedures agreed for the project.&#13;
&#13;
I. Coordinationofdonors&#13;
&#13;
121.      Donor coordination in Liberia i s very active through the LRDC, as discussed in Section&#13;
A.2.&#13;
&#13;
J.        Environmentalaspects and compliancewiththe World Bank SafeguardPolicies&#13;
&#13;
122.      As an emergency recovery operation, processed under World Bank OP 8.50, safeguard&#13;
instruments do not need to be approved and disclosed in country and at the InfoShop prior to&#13;
appraisal. The project i s classified environmental assessment category B. It will focus on&#13;
reconstruction and repair o f existing infrastructure and the environmental policy (OP 4.01) i s&#13;
triggered. Road works will be confined to the primary and secondary road networks. The forest&#13;
policy (OP 4.36) i s therefore not triggered. Whether the involuntary resettlement policy (OP 4.12)&#13;
i s triggered, will be determined in the context o f the upcoming environmental and social impact&#13;
studies associated with the emergency works. If triggered, a Resettlement Action Plan will be&#13;
prepared, approved by the Bank, disclosed and implementedprior to the start o f land clearing or&#13;
construction.&#13;
&#13;
 123.     Environmental Management Plans are either already under preparation or will be&#13;
prepared for all activities supported by the project. These are expected to be completed within six&#13;
months following project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
 124.     To strengthen local capacity for environmental and social management i s currently weak,&#13;
it is anticipated that an environmental consultant will be engaged initially to manage and oversee&#13;
the environmental and social management process o f the project while providing institutional&#13;
strengthening and on-the-job training services throughout the period.&#13;
&#13;
          PART 5.         BENEFITS, SUSTAINABILITY, POTENTIAL RISKS AND&#13;
                                            MITIGATION&#13;
&#13;
 125.     Benefits: The project i s designed to support the emergency reinstatement o f critical&#13;
infrastructure in the road and water sectors and will use the outcomes o f the assessment studies&#13;
included in TFLIB as the basis for most o f the works. It will help prevent further deterioration o f&#13;
health by increasing the access to clean drinking water. It will also help revive the economy by&#13;
restoring transport infrastructure and reduce poverty by facilitating farm to market access,&#13;
Finally, the project will facilitate reintegratingthe country by re-establishing transportation links.&#13;
&#13;
 126.     Sustainability: The project will support infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and&#13;
repair in the road and water sectors. Due to the nature and extent o f the emergency, the project&#13;
provides maximum support to these activities to ensure both improved road access inLiberia and&#13;
 improved potable water supply to Monrovia.&#13;
&#13;
 127.     Government already allocated some funding for maintenance activities in these sectors.&#13;
 This i s however insufficient for sustainable operations. The project, additionally, supports two&#13;
 studies, one for a road reclassification and condition survey and one on identifying methods to&#13;
 improve the efficiency and strengthen the LWSC. Both these studies will provide Government&#13;
 with recommendations to improve maintenance and overall sustainability inthese sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
128.     Inreality, Government has not been inpower for long enough to set up and implement&#13;
sustainable systems in these two sectors. Currently the focus i s on emergency reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation. However, Government i s already preparing I-PRSP, the longer term development&#13;
strategy mentioned above, that will also address the issue o f longer term sustainability o f&#13;
infrastructure. The Bank will also duringproject implementation provide additional guidance and&#13;
advice to Government for the implementation o f sustainable maintenance practices.&#13;
&#13;
129.     Risks: The risks to the project are substantial. Apart from some activities under TFLB&#13;
and LICUS-funding, this will be the first major Bank-supported project to be implemented by&#13;
Government since the early eighties. This means that the development, safeguard, financial, and&#13;
fiduciary risks are high.Therefore IDA will work closely with Government to ensure the risks are&#13;
identified and mitigated appropriately. The major risks are:&#13;
&#13;
(i)      Limited capacity to prepare and manage the Project within MPW: The internal capacity&#13;
in the MPW is insufficient to implement all the activities efficiently. Mitigation: The MPW will&#13;
establish a Special Implementation Unit consisting o f a mix o f MPW-staff and experienced&#13;
externally recruited professionals to implement the project activities. This arrangement would&#13;
assure the implementation capacity from the start and will assist in building further capacity to&#13;
eventually manage all roadmanagement activities by MPW.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)     Private sector interest in civil works contracts is not forthcoming:      Based on current&#13;
business conditions, the private sector may be hesitant to undertake the required emergency&#13;
works especially as heavy equipment i s not available inLiberia and will need to be shipped to the&#13;
country. Mitigation: The project would package the works to generate such interest and would&#13;
provide for additional dissemination to build private sector interest in these Bank-financed&#13;
activities. Two options were considered, either to use a large size one contract in magnitude o f&#13;
US$16-20 million or to use a number o f smaller works contracts. The preferable option would be&#13;
three contracts, two for the emergency works on the primary roads and one for the works on&#13;
bridges and culverts.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)    Donor Coordination may be dgjcult in the emergency environment: Due to the short&#13;
preparation and implementation time proper donor coordination may not be possible for the water&#13;
sector activities. Mitigation: The team i s preparing the project to allow for both options, either&#13;
with coordination or without. At appraisal, the Bank and the EU agreed to coordinate their&#13;
support in the water sector while the support in the electricity sector already includes close&#13;
coordination with the EC and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
(iv)     Corruption: Liberia has a history o f corruption at most levels o f society and project&#13;
implementation would also be exposed. Mitigation: The team will include in project preparation&#13;
and implementation the following actions          -tight procurement control (low prior review&#13;
thresholds), regular supervision (quality and quantity by qualified supervision consultants), both&#13;
off-site and through Bank missions to verify that the physical and financial parameters are&#13;
reconciled, tight cost control (no price fluctuations and fixed price contracts) as well as provision&#13;
for technical and financial audits. Inaddition to the issues outlined above, it i s important to note&#13;
that large quantities of diesel fuel for the EPP will require special measures to ensure both its&#13;
transparent procurement and security. To this end, the Bank and USAID are cooperating to&#13;
design appropriate safeguards and accounting mechanisms. These will be agreed over the coming&#13;
months and will likely consist of guarded facilities, plus fully metered controls and accounting.&#13;
These procedures, when agreed, will become part o f the Project's procurementplan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Exit Strategy&#13;
&#13;
130.   Ifprogresstowards achievingthe objectives ofthe project is unsatisfactory, IDA,inclose&#13;
consultations with other development partners and civil society, will review its activities, and&#13;
consider restructuring, scaling back, or suspending its project.&#13;

C1.     FinancialManagementAssessment&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The financial management assessment was carried out in accordance with the Financial&#13;
Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Board on 3 November 2005.&#13;
The objective o f the assessment was to determine whether the implementing entities have&#13;
acceptable financial management arrangements, which will ensure: (1) the funds are used only for&#13;
the intendedpurposes in an efficient and economical way, (2) the preparation o f accurate, reliable&#13;
and timely periodic financial reports, and (3) safeguard the entity's assets.&#13;
&#13;
The financial management assessment was carried by the Bank financial management team and&#13;
included interviews with key staff (including financial comptroller) at the Ministry o f Public&#13;
Works. Our assessment also draws on earlier work carried out under Economic Management and&#13;
Development Program for Liberia.&#13;
&#13;
Overview of ProgramandImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
The main objective o f the proposed emergency infrastructure project i s to provide the&#13;
Government o f Liberia with emergency support to restore priority infrastructure. The Bank will&#13;
provide this support through two main components, namely (i)emergency rehabilitation and&#13;
repair o f critical infrastructure; this will be done through the emergency reconstruction, repair and&#13;
improvement o f critical road and potable water supply infrastructure as well as support for&#13;
electricity generation in Monrovia; and (ii)     institutional capacity strengthening of the Ministry o f&#13;
Public Works (MPW) and the LWSC; this seeks to strengthen MPW's capacity to carry out its&#13;
roads development and maintenance management functions, establish effective monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems and operate effective longer term planning and budgeting mechanisms. The&#13;
project will support the strengthening o f LWSC's functions o f revenue collection and metering&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
The overall project oversight will be provided by a project steering committee, chaired by the&#13;
MinistryofPublic Works and withmembership includingrepresentatives from Infrastructureand&#13;
Basic Services Pillars, MOT, LWSC and MOF. The MPW will implement the Project through the&#13;
creation o f a Special Implementation Unit (SIU) staffed with a combination o f competent MPW&#13;
staff and selected technical assistance. The MPW has weak capacity to implement this project,&#13;
hence the creation of the SIU. The S I U will support with re-establishing key functions, including&#13;
procurement and contract management as well as, on a supporting basis to the PFMU, financial&#13;
management functions, in the MPW. The S I U will be staffed with competent professionals with&#13;
the required experience and qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
The project will also support the establishment o f the PFMU in the MOF. The PFMU will be&#13;
responsible for all financial management functions o f the SIU. The P F M U will be responsible for&#13;
the day to day management o f project finances, will prepare project financial procedures manual,&#13;
including the required IFRs and will put in place adequate arrangements for the auditing o f the&#13;
project financial statements at the end o f each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Country Accountability Issues&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has not yet carried out a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) or&#13;
ESW in the area o f financial management for Liberia and may not do so in the next 2 years. It i s&#13;
therefore not possible to detail out the overall country issues. However, since Liberia i s emerging&#13;
from 15 years o f civil war, it i s only right to assume the non-existence o f adequate financial&#13;
management systems for the country as well as agencies that would be involved in project&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
The risk analysis and the mitigation measures are limited to the risk within the project's control.&#13;

  Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
 Strengths&#13;
&#13;
 There i s a strong commitment by the MOF and the MPW to support the implementation o f the&#13;
 project. The SrU and the P F M U will be staffed by experienced and competent staff selected&#13;
 competitively to ensure speedy and timely implementation. These units will establish and&#13;
 maintain at all times appropriate financial management systems and practices that will meet the&#13;
 World Bank FMrequirements.&#13;
  Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
 As inother post conflict countries, the overall fiduciary environment inLiberia i s very weak. The&#13;
  accounting staff at the M O F and M P W has limited experience with World Bank financial and&#13;
  disbursement procedures. The PFMU will be required to build FM capacity at the MOF and&#13;
  MPW. Successful implementation o f this project will require ownership and active support from&#13;
  Governmental authorities and less o f interference. This i s the greatest challenge that this project&#13;
  will face.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
FMStaffing for the Project&#13;
&#13;
The key staff that will have responsibility for the day to day financial management will be a&#13;
professional accountant recruited as part o f the PFMU team. H e will initially be the PFMUHead&#13;
and will be responsible for overall project management. Capacity o f accounting staff o f MOF will&#13;
be built by the PFMU, in the areas of good financial management practices and World Bank FM&#13;
and disbursement procedures. Some good performing accounting staff from the MOF will be&#13;
attached to the PFMU for the transfer o f on thejob experience. These seconded staff will report to&#13;
the head of the finance unit within the PFMU. The staff will receive training from the PFMU in&#13;
the procedures established for the project and the Ministry.&#13;
Project Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
The PFMU will have an accountants/internal auditors with professional qualifications acceptable&#13;
to IDA who will be responsible for the day to day financial management o f the project. They will&#13;
report to the head o f the PFMU. The PFMU will establish an effective accounting system that&#13;
provides for adequate segregation o f functions, capable o f recording all accounting transactions,&#13;
and reporting correctly all assets and liabilities o f the project. The system should also be capable&#13;
o f producing accurate periodic financial reports including IFRs and annual project financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
&#13;
The project will adopt the cash basis in the treatment and recording o f all transactions, In&#13;
addition, the project will maintain a statement o f liabilities outstanding at all times to correctly&#13;
reflect the projects indebtedness to suppliers and third parties. The financial management system&#13;
should be documented in a financial accounting procedures manual which must be cleared by the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The project will support the MPW and MOF through a PPF to enable them carry out certain&#13;
minor activities until the two units have been established. The funds will be managed by the&#13;
MOF. The staff will be supported by the finance staff o f an ongoing Bank funded project in&#13;
Liberia, the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment Project. The level o f PPF imprest will&#13;
be small and will be for specified project preparation activities and will be agreed with the Bank,&#13;
This will minimize the level o friskand also ensure that some activities are carried out prior to the&#13;
engagement o f the SIU.&#13;
&#13;
There will be an MOU signed within six months after effectiveness by the MOF and the M P W&#13;
establishing the respective responsibilities o f the PFMU and the SW and defining the service&#13;
standards associated with the project requirements that bothparties shall adhere to,&#13;
&#13;
 BudgetingArrangements&#13;
&#13;
The project will prepare an annual budget for the project based upon the agreed program to be&#13;
financed by the project. Most o f the activities o f the key components are already known and these&#13;
will be included in the project annual budgets. The annual project budget will be reviewed and&#13;
agreed with the World Bank, and No objections will be issued for only activities agreed in the&#13;
budget.&#13;
&#13;
 Flow of FundsArrangements&#13;
&#13;
The project arrangements are such that there will be no implementing entities at any decentralized&#13;
location and the FPMU will therefore operate a centralized funds management system for the&#13;
project. The S I U will send all requests for payment to the PFMU projects Accountant for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
processing and payments. Where the single payment i s above a defined threshold the P F M U will&#13;
process and send these to the Bank for direct payment to the third party. The PFMU will, on&#13;
behalf o f the project submit withdrawal applications to the World Bank on a monthly basis. This&#13;
will ensure the project has funds for operations at all times.&#13;
&#13;
AuditingArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Independent and qualified private sector auditors, acceptable to the Bank, would be selected by&#13;
the PFMUto carry out the audit o f the project. The selection o f auditors shall be on competitive&#13;
basis and in accordance with the Bank's guidelines and would be in place nine months after the&#13;
effectiveness of the project.&#13;
&#13;
The project financial statements includingmovements in the designated accounts will be audited&#13;
inaccordance with InternationalStandards of Auditing(ISA) and a single opinion will be issued&#13;
to cover the project financial statements, SOEs and the designated account, in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's new audit policy.&#13;
&#13;
The auditors' report and opinion inrespect o f the financial statements including the management&#13;
letter would be furnishedto the World Bank within six months o f the close o f each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
 Reporting andMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
The SIU will prepare quarterly IFRs in the areas o f finance, procurement, including complaints&#13;
frombidders, and project progress. The reports are;&#13;
&#13;
The Quarterly Financial Report (To be compiledand completedby the PFMU);                   which&#13;
would consist o f a statement o f cash receipts by sources and expenditures by main expenditure&#13;
classifications for the period and cumulatively; cash balances o f the project; and supporting&#13;
schedules comparing actual and budgeted expenditures;&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly Physical ProgressReport (To be compiledand completed by the SIU);&#13;
include a narrative information and output indicators, linking financial information with physical&#13;
progress and report on issues that require attention;&#13;
&#13;
 Quarterly Procurement Management Report (To be compiled and completed by the SIU);&#13;
would consist o f information on procurement for goods and works and that for consultants'&#13;
 services and compliance with agreed procurement methods. The report compares procurement&#13;
performance against the plan agreed at negotiations and appropriately updated at the end o f each&#13;
quarter, The report should also provide any information on complaints by bidders, unsatisfactory&#13;
performance by contractors and any contractual disputes.&#13;
&#13;
The S I U will be responsible for preparing the IFR required to be produced under the project and&#13;
will submit copies to the PFMUU and the Bank within 45 days o f the end o f each quarter. The&#13;
 content and format o f these reports will be agreed upon two months after the S I U and the P F M U&#13;
have been established.&#13;
&#13;
 DisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
 The proceeds o f the grant would be disbursed over four years. A period o f four (4) months after&#13;
 closing date would be allowed to make disbursements for expenditures incurred untilthe closing&#13;
 date o f the grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Use Statementof Expenditures(SOEs)&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full documentation, except for items o f&#13;
expenditures under contracts and purchase orders below US$200 000 equivalent each, for works,&#13;
below US$lOO 000 equivalent each, for goods, below US$50 000 equivalent each for consulting&#13;
firms, and US$lO 000 each for consultant services (individuals), training and incremental costs&#13;
for which disbursements would be based on statement o f expenditures (SOEs).           Supporting&#13;
documentation for SOEs would be retained by the PFMU for review by IDA missions and&#13;
external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
DesignatedAccount @A)&#13;
&#13;
The Grant Designated account (DA) o f the project will be managed by the PFMU. The grant DA&#13;
can only be operated after the establishment o f the PFMU. It i s expected that prior to the&#13;
recruitment o f the SIU and PFMU, a PPF Designated Account will be opened and operated by the&#13;
MOF for initial project activities. The Designated Account for the project funds will be&#13;
maintained in US$ and opened at a commercial bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to&#13;
the IDA. Upon grant effectiveness and submission o f a withdrawal application by the recipient, a&#13;
sum of US$ 1.O million would be deposited by the Bank into the DA. Further deposits would be&#13;
made into this account against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documentation.&#13;

Supervisionplan&#13;
&#13;
During the first year of the project implementation, intensive World Bank supervision will be&#13;
required in order to ensure that the project financial management arrangements are in place and&#13;
functioning. The first supervision mission after effectiveness will take the form o f an FM&#13;
Specialist visiting MOF and M P W to review systems and operations introduced by the&#13;
PFMU/SIU. There will be a minimumo f two supervision missions per year.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusionof FMAssessment&#13;
&#13;
The financial management assessment has concluded that the risk for the project i s Substantial&#13;
and actions have been put inplace to ensure that the identifiedrisks are adequately mitigated. The&#13;
engagement of a professionally qualified       accountant to head up the PFMU initially, the&#13;
requirement for the establishment of systems and procedures by the S I U as part o f their&#13;
assignment, and the agreed auditing arrangements for the project ensure that the project risks are&#13;
minimized. This will also require intensive Bank supervision in the first year o f project&#13;
implementationto ensure that introduced systems by the PFMU/SIU are functioning well and that&#13;
all agreed actions have been fully implemented.&#13;

D1.      ProcurementManagementAssessment&#13;
&#13;
A. General&#13;
&#13;
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines:   Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Recipients" dated M a y&#13;
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement or any other method accepted by the&#13;
Bank. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general below,&#13;
For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant&#13;
selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and&#13;
time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank in the Procurement Plan, The&#13;
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Works: Works contracts valued at about US$22.2 million to be procured under&#13;
this project would include repair works on primary road network, repair and construction of&#13;
bridges and culverts and rehabilitation and distribution o f water systems. The procurementwill be&#13;
done usingthe Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed&#13;
with or satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts below $200,000 but above $50,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract may be procured under National Competitive Bidding. Contracts estimated to cost less&#13;
than $50,000 equivalent per contract would be procured using shopping procedures based on a&#13;
model request for quotations satisfactory to the Bank. Direct contracting may be used where&#13;
necessary, subject to Bank's no objection.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Goods: Goods estimated to cost about US$2.9 millionto be procured under this&#13;
project would include fuel purchases to support power generation in Monrovia as well as&#13;
vehicles, office equipment and computers to support the SIU. The procurement will be done using&#13;

&#13;
Alternatively, goods may also be procured from UN Agencies (e.g. IAPSO - Inter-Agency&#13;
Procurement Services Office)  provided that such a contract does not exceed US$lOO,OOO for each&#13;
type o f goods.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
B.AssessmentoftheMPW's capacityto implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
An assessment of the capacity o f the country to implement procurement actions was initially&#13;
carried out by a World Bank team led by Mbuba Mbungu (Senior Procurement Specialist) in&#13;
August 2004. The assessment reviewed to some extent the organizational structure for&#13;
implementing projects and the interactionbetween the projects' staff responsible for procurement&#13;
and the Government's relevant central unit for administrationand finance.&#13;
&#13;
Since January 2006, Liberia has a new Procurement Law that i s based on the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines. The Law lists procedures that need to be complied with. Namely, the Procuring Entity&#13;
at the MPW has to be involved in the process o f procuring contracts. Contracts will be signed by&#13;
the designated officials o f the MPW and beneficiary agencies, which will then be responsible for&#13;
the management o f the contracts.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement capacity in the Ministry o f Public Works i s very limited therefore there i s need&#13;
to develop it gradually but rapidly. Firstly, a Special Implementation Unit (SIU) was created and&#13;
it will be staffed with a combination o f technical assistance and competent MPW staff. The SIU&#13;
will have responsibilities in the areas o f project management, procurement, and financial&#13;
management. Its responsibilities will include (a) assuring steady progress o f the procurement in&#13;
 accordance with an implementation schedule reviewed and approved by the World Bank, and (b)&#13;
 ensuring satisfactory implementation o f activities included inall contract.&#13;
&#13;
 At a minimum,the SIU will include a procurement specialist with engineering background and a&#13;
 financial   management specialist who, together, will implement the necessary procurement&#13;
 activities. The specialist will; (i)&#13;
                                    plan and process all procurement (ii) the implementation&#13;
                                                                         monitor&#13;
 of the procurement plans, and (iii)train staff o f the implementing agencies in the use o f&#13;
 procurement procedures agreed under the project, including compliance with World bank&#13;
 Procurement Guidelines. The initial strengthening o f procurement capacity will commence with&#13;
 the assistance of a Procurement specialist from the neighbouring Ghana office and will be&#13;
 followed up with the recruitment o f a Short Term consultant regionally. This arrangement will be&#13;
 followed by the international recruitment o f a firm who will provide the procurement and contract&#13;
 management/administration specialists. They will train the Government staff in the SIU&#13;
 additional to the specialized procurement courses they will attend inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
 The overall project risk for procurement i s substantial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C.ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan, a summarised version i s attached&#13;
hereto, for project implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This&#13;
plan will be finalised within two months after effectiveness as soon as the project coordinator and&#13;
procurement specialist have been appointed. It will then be available at the SIU-office, MPW,&#13;
South Lynch Street, Monrovia, in the project's database and on the Bank's external website. The&#13;
Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to&#13;
reflect the actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
D.Frequency ofProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity&#13;
assessment o f the implementing Agency has recommended at least three supervision missions&#13;
each year to visit the field to carry out review o f procurement actions.&#13;
&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Liberia Emergency Infrastructure
            Project will, on an emergency basis, assist the Government
            to reconstruct parts of the country's devastated
            infrastructure. These actions will help revive the economy
            and reintegrate the country by restoring vital transport
            links throughout the country. It will also support the
            improvement of living conditions in the capital, Monrovia,
            by restoring and expanding potable water supply services and
            improve the provision of emergency power to parts of
            Monrovia. The risks to the project are substantial. This
            will be the first large Bank-supported project to be
            implemented by Government. As such, implementation needs to
            be carefully planned to mitigate environmental and social
            risks as well as financial and procurement risks. The
            international Development Association will work closely with
            Government to ensure that risks are identified and mitigated
            appropriately. The major risks are: (1) limited capacity to
            prepare and manage the Project within the Ministry of Pubic
            Works; 2i) private sector interest in civil works contracts
            is not forthcoming; (3) donor coordination may be difficult
            in the emergency environment; and (4) corruption and mismanagement.
