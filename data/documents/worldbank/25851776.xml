Communications networks underpin regional and global trade. This is particularly true in East&#13;
Africa where mobile phones are plentiful but postal services are virtually non-existent and cross-&#13;
border road and railway links are subject to the vagaries of adverse environmental conditions. It&#13;
takes, for instance, between 5 and 8 days to transport goods from Mombasa, on the Kenyan coast&#13;
to the South Sudan capital of Juba.1 But high mobile roaming charges, and surcharges on incoming&#13;
international traffic (SIIT), create a similar barrier for cross-border electronic communications.&#13;
Recognizing this, the countries of the East African Community (EAC) made a joint commitment&#13;
in 2014 to create one network area (ONA) for the five economies of the EAC (Burundi, Kenya,&#13;
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda), with the benefits also being extended to South Sudan. Specifically,&#13;
for cross-border traffic originating in those countries, rates have been capped, mobile roaming&#13;
charges eliminated and SIIT abolished.&#13;
&#13;
The early results have been remarkable: Inbound roaming calls to Kenya from Rwanda increased&#13;
by over 950 per cent, from 63Ã¢&#128;&#153;483 minutes in September 2014 to over a million minutes by&#13;
December (Figure 1). Furthermore, the main traffic increase occurred on 8th October, the same day&#13;
the changes were implemented, suggesting consumers are not only price sensitive but also well-&#13;
informed. In Uganda, one of the most highly taxed countries in Africa, retail roaming rates were&#13;
cut from US$0.93 to US$0.10 per minute. It is expected that the benefits of creating the ONA will&#13;
include increased trade, enhanced regional integration and reduced costs of doing business, as well&#13;
as increased revenues to the operators and the governments.2 Success with mobile voice traffic&#13;
should also encourage operators to cut data roaming charges, perhaps without regulatory&#13;
intervention.&#13;

            Communications networks underpin
            regional and global trade. This is particularly true in East
            Africa where mobile phones are plentiful but postal services
            are virtually non-existent and cross border road and railway
            links are subject to the vagaries of adverse environmental
            conditions. High mobile roaming charges, and surcharges on
            incoming international traffic (SIIT), create a similar
            barrier for cross-border electronic communications.
            Recognizing this, the countries of the East African
            Community (EAC) made a joint commitment in 2014 to create
            one network area (ONA) for the five economies of the EAC
            (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda), with the
            benefits also being extended to South Sudan. It is expected
            that the benefits of creating the ONA will include increased
            trade, enhanced regional integration, and reduced costs of
            doing business, as well as increased revenues to the
            operators and the governments. Success with mobile voice
            traffic should also encourage operators to cut data roaming
            charges, perhaps without regulatory intervention.
