REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECr SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                  Republic of Sierra Leone.&#13;
Beneficiaries:             Ministry of Transport, Communications and the Environment&#13;
(MTCE); Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA); Sierra Leone&#13;
Ports Authority (SLPA); Sierra Leone Airports Authority&#13;
(SLAA).&#13;
Povertv Categorv:           The project does not include a specific targeted intervention to&#13;
reduce poverty. However, it will have a significant impact on&#13;
poverty alleviation for the rural and urban poor, by providing&#13;
employment opportunities particularly in road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance, improving access to markets for agricultural prod-&#13;
ucts and to social services such as health and education.&#13;
Amount:                     SDR 24.3 million (US$35.0 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:                      Standard IDA, with 40 years matunty.&#13;
Commitment Fee:             Standard (a variable rate between 0 and 0.5% of the undisbursed&#13;
credit balance set annually by the Executive Directors of IDA).&#13;
Onlendi! Terms:             About US$8.3 million and US$2.5 million equivalent of the&#13;
Credit would be onlent from the Government to SLPA and&#13;
SLAA, respectively, for 20 years including a grace period of 5&#13;
years at 6.9% per annum. SLPA and SLAA would bear the for-&#13;
eign exchange risk.&#13;
Description:               The project will support a four year time-slice (1996-1999) of&#13;
Government's ten year sector investment program and will have&#13;
three main components: (a) capacity building to: (i) build up the&#13;
Coordination and Monitoring Unit at MTCE; (ii) establish and&#13;
support a new autonomous Road Transport Authority (RTA) re-&#13;
sponsible for road transport regulation, vehicle registration and li-&#13;
censing, and vehicle examination; and (iii) develop small and me-&#13;
dium sized and labor-based enterprises for road works; (b) para-&#13;
statal restructuring and privatization to: (i) improve the organ-&#13;
izational structure of SLRA including the creation of a Finance&#13;
Department; (ii) restructure SLPA, including possible devolution&#13;
and/or privatization of some of its functions, and restructure the&#13;
Freetown-Tagrin ferry operations, and (iii) privatize the Sierra&#13;
Leone Road Transport Corporation (SLRTC), the Sierra National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Airlines (SNA) and the Sierra Leone National Shipping Company&#13;
(SLNSC); and (c) investment to include: (i) a program of peri-&#13;
odic maintenance of about 460 km of trunk roads, spot improve-&#13;
ment of about 550 km of feeder roads and repair/overlaying of&#13;
20 km of city streets; (ii) traffic management measures in Free-&#13;
town; (iii) in the port, slipway repair, quay rehabilitation and&#13;
pavement of container stacking area; (iv) in the airport, runway&#13;
repair, and edge lighting, procurement of safety equipment, and&#13;
protective fencing; and (v) for coastal and river transport, reha-&#13;
bilitation/provision of landing and storage facilities.&#13;
Befefits:                   The project's direct, tangible but unmeasurable benefits are as&#13;
follows: improved, more transparent sector management, includ-&#13;
ing more effective management and monitoring of sector parasta-&#13;
tals and their operations on a commercial basis; increased direct&#13;
private sector participation in road maintenance, waterway&#13;
transportation, port and airline operations, and vehicle examina-&#13;
tion, and indirect private sector participation through user repre-&#13;
sentation on the boards of transport parastatals; through a steady&#13;
volume of road maintenance works, expanded capacity of small&#13;
and medium construction enterprises and of local consultants in&#13;
project preparation, implementation, auditing and supervision;&#13;
training of skilled and unskilled labor, which can move to other&#13;
construction activities; savings in travel time by households to&#13;
jobs, schools, markets and health facilities in urban and poor pefi-&#13;
urban areas as well as rural areas; improved airport safety&#13;
through compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organi-&#13;
zation (ICAO) security regulations for the airport; and support to&#13;
the Transport Sector Policy consistent with overall macro-&#13;
economic objectives, in particular Sierra Leone's competitiveness&#13;
in local and regional markets, and poverty alleviation resulting&#13;
mainly from increased domestic employment and training of labor&#13;
and contractors.&#13;
The project's direct, measurable benefits are based on quantifi-&#13;
able benefits arising mainly from user cost savings. The road&#13;
component has an overall EIRR of 25% and NPV of US$8.0 mil-&#13;
lion discounted at 12%, with all subcomponents yielding EIiRRs&#13;
greater than 12%, except for a few sections classified as gravel&#13;
main roads. These sections are expected to yield higher EIRRs if&#13;
uncaptured benefits to farmers are incorporated. The non IDA-&#13;
financed portion of the program is estimated to yield EIRRs be-&#13;
tween 12% to 40%. The road transport component has an EIRR&#13;
of 25% and NPV of $1.6 million, discounted at 12%. The port&#13;
rehabilitation component has an overall EIRR of 24% and NPV&#13;
of US$7.1 million discounted at 12%. Five typical landing sites&#13;
of the coastal and river transport component have EIRRs ranging&#13;
from 16% to 97% for the selected locations. The air transport&#13;
component yields an EIRR of 19% and NPV of US$0.7 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
discounted at 12%. It is estimated that about 1,600 person-years&#13;
of the employment would be generated by the project.&#13;
Risks:                      The principal risk is related to the political and security situation&#13;
caused by the rebel activities which have in the past rendered all&#13;
areas of the country except the Freetown Peninsula and the Lungi&#13;
Airport area unsafe for economic activities. However, the expec-&#13;
tation is that the recent inauguration of the newly elected demo-&#13;
cratic government on March 29, 1996, a cease-fire currently in ef-&#13;
fect, and on-going negotiations with the rebel movement will&#13;
further contribute to the marked improvement in the security&#13;
situation observed over the few months prior to the cease-fire.&#13;
Since many of the components of the project (rehabilitation of&#13;
port, airport, coastal and river transport, establishment of RTA,&#13;
sector management and coordination) are located in safe areas, a&#13;
first phase of the proposed project could be implemented even un-&#13;
der the situation that existed before the cease-fire. However,&#13;
should rebel activities recur, a deteriorated security situation&#13;
could make economic growth unlikely and hence the justification&#13;
for the planned investments in isolated areas questionable. It&#13;
could also lead to delays in project implementation. Another po-&#13;
litical risk is related to the Government having to find the balance&#13;
between the need for improved road infrastructure and the elec-&#13;
torate's willingness to pay for it. In particular, it may not be fea-&#13;
sible for the Government to increase and maintain the road main-&#13;
tenance levy on fuel and other road user charges at levels neces-&#13;
sary for adequate funding of road maintenance. This risk would&#13;
be minimized, considering: (a) that the increase in road mainte-&#13;
nance levy on fuel and other road user charges will be phased; the&#13;
first phase being at the same level of about US$0.08 per liter&#13;
which was first effected in December 1994; (b) that the private&#13;
sector and road transport stakeholders are represented on the&#13;
Board of SLRA, and had approved this level of levy at that time;&#13;
(c) that SLRA is widely recognized by the public as one of the&#13;
most effective Government entities; and (d) that the public has&#13;
come to appreciate the improvements that SLRA has made on the&#13;
road network in the past few years. There are no significant&#13;
technical risks, as the work will be carried out using conventional&#13;
construction methods by qualified contractors and consultants un-&#13;
der proven management capability, especially in the case of&#13;
SRLA.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
I.1    This is the first time that a sector-wide investment approach has been adopted for the sus-&#13;
tainable development of the transport sector in Sierra Leone. The proposed Intemational Devel-&#13;
opment Association (IDA) credit, together with pledges from other donors, would help support&#13;
implementation of the 1996-1999 Transport Sector Investment Program and the proposed Trans-&#13;
port Sector Project (TSP) jointly developed by the Govemment, sectoral agencies, user groups,&#13;
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and all donors active in the sector. The main differences&#13;
between the sector approach and the traditional system of donors negotiating on an individual basis&#13;
with the Government are that the sector approach: (a) covers the entire sector including mainte-&#13;
nance as well as the more conventional capital investment, policy reform and institutional issues;&#13;
(b) has been jointly prepared with local stakeholders (Government and private/public road users)&#13;
and donors, with the former taking the lead, (c) is supported by all donors active in the sector;&#13;
(d) makes better use of scarce local resources; and (e) promotes standardized implementation pro-&#13;
cedures.&#13;
1.2    Previous projects supported by the Bank and other donors have attempted to address the&#13;
issues of a senously deteriorated transport sector and necessary institutional and policy reform on a&#13;
somewhat piecemeal basis. This project, therefore, adopts a comprehensive sector wide approach&#13;
as a means of directing and coordinating the efforts of Government and all donors towards sustain-&#13;
able development.&#13;
B.    MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1 3    Sierra Leone is a small country (71,740 square kilometers) located on the Atlantic Coast&#13;
of Afnca. It has a humid, tropical climate with rainfall averaging more than 200 inches per year.&#13;
The country is hilly to mountainous and traversed by many navigable rivers. It has considerable&#13;
water resources, a rich soil, ample cultivable land and a climate favorable to the culture of rice and&#13;
other subsistence crops, as well as cocoa, coffee, palm kemels, piassava and other export cash&#13;
crops. It is endowed with substantial mineral wealth, particularly large deposits of diamonds&#13;
(alluvial deposits and kimberlite pipes) and rutile (used in the manufacturing of paints), and sig-&#13;
nificant deposits of bauxite, iron ore, chromite and gold.&#13;
1.4   In spite of these substantial natural resources, Sierra Leone is rated by the United Nations&#13;
as one of the least-developed and poorest countries in the world. With a population of 4.4 million&#13;
(1994), growing at an annual average rate of 2.4%, Sierra Leone's per capita income has dwindled&#13;
to US$150 in 1994 due to the inadequate development efforts and ill-conceived economic policies&#13;
of the past. Income distribution is uneven and over two thirds of the population live in absolute&#13;
poverty. Infant mortality is one of the highest in the world (163 per 1,000 live births), and life ex-&#13;
pectancy among the lowest (40 years ). The economy is based primarily on agriculture and min-&#13;
ing, which account for 47% and 8% of GDP (1994), respectively. The modem sector is small and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
dominated by a few public corporations and private mining concems. It coexists with a largely&#13;
traditional agricultural sector, which sustains more than two thirds of the population, generally at a&#13;
bare subsistence level. Since 1991, real per capita income has fallen further, due to the negative&#13;
impact of the rebel activities on economic activity. Close to 2 million people have been displaced&#13;
because of the security problems, which has further exacerbated poverty. The population in&#13;
Freetown, the capital city is estimated to have more than doubled to 1.5 million during the past&#13;
four years. On top of this, Sierra Leone has to cope with the influx of over 200,000 refugees from&#13;
Liberia. Many rural areas have been isolated during the conflict and the infrastructure is in disre-&#13;
pair.&#13;
1.5    To reverse past trends, the Government embarked in December 1989 on the daunting task&#13;
of correcting two decades of economic mismanagement by implementing a significant economic&#13;
reforms package, which was instrumental in winning back intemational confidence and support.&#13;
Since 1992, the Govenmment's economic reform program has been implemented with financial sup-&#13;
port from IDA. The major goals of the structural adjustment program are to lay the foundations&#13;
for sustainable private sector-led economic growth, and poverty alleviation. The Program com-&#13;
bines macroeconomic stabilization measures (restrictive monetary and budgetary policies) with&#13;
structural reforms aimed at liberalizing domestic and foreign trade, reforming the civil service and&#13;
privatizing/rehabilitating public enterprises.&#13;
1.6    The escalation in rebel attacks at the end of 1994 and during the first half of 1995 seri-&#13;
ously interfered with policy implementation. In particular, rebel attacks led to the closure of the&#13;
rutile and bauxite mines, drastically reducing foreign exchange receipts and fiscal revenues. Fur-&#13;
thermore, the uncertainties created by the rebel attacks negatively affected business confidence and&#13;
general economic activity. This, in tum, caused large revenue shortfalls, in particular in the col-&#13;
lection of petroleum taxes and custom duties. In addition, emergency defense expenditures in-&#13;
creased as the Government intensified its campaign against the rebels. As a consequence of these&#13;
developments, the govemment budget deficit for 1994/95 widened to 7.3% of GDP, compared with&#13;
a target of 5.2%. Monetary policy, nonetheless, remained on track, largely because of weak pri-&#13;
vate sector credit demand and active use of open market operations by the central bank. After be-&#13;
ing reduced to less than 20% in 1993, and 1994, inflation rose to 30% in 1995 as a result of a&#13;
sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and a jump in the price of imported rice and wheat, adding&#13;
to the hardship of people already affected by shortages in domestic food production. The interrup-&#13;
tion of bauxite and rutile exports in early 1995, followed by the loss of diamond export proceeds in&#13;
mid- 1995, compounded by lower than expected donor flows, gave rise to increasingly severe bal-&#13;
ance of payments pressures during the course of 1995. In order to avert an unduly sharp deprecia-&#13;
tion of the exchange rate, the central bank sold foreign exchange and reserves fell to US$10 mil-&#13;
lion, or 0.9 months of imports, at the end of October 1995. With the significant improvement in&#13;
the security situation over the past 8 months and national elections of February and March 1996,&#13;
which resulted in the inauguration of a newly elected democratic Government on March 29, 1996,&#13;
the Government should be able to restore and intensify the ongoing economic reforms.&#13;
C.    RoLE OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.7    The new Government's priorities are to (i) ensure peace and nation-wide security;&#13;
(ii) reintegrate internally and externally displaced people, refugees and ex-combatants into normal,&#13;
productive life, and (iii) create an environment for sustained labor-intensive, private sector-led&#13;
growth. Improvements in physical infrastructure in the transport sector will have a key role in the&#13;
Government's strategy for achieving these objectives by facilitating the supply response to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
streamnlined incentives that have been implemnented as part of the structural adjustment program.&#13;
Improvements of rural feeder and trunk roads and in coastal and river transport system would help&#13;
alleviate poverty by providing market outlets for fanners and increasing food availability. Indi-&#13;
rectly, through the use of labor intensive methods for road maintenance throughout the country,&#13;
employment and income opportunities would also improve. Improvement in the transport network&#13;
will also help integrate the different parts of the country and thus reduce the isolation and depriva-&#13;
tion that has provided a ground for the rebel insurgency. Implementation of this strategy will re-&#13;
quire substantial investments in rehabilitation and a strengthening of institutional mechanisms to&#13;
maintain the newly rehabilitated facilities.&#13;
1.8    The proposed TSP will contribute: (a) to enhance country-wide mobility of goods and&#13;
people and reduce transport costs through maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the&#13;
highest priority section of the transportation network, (b) to ensure that the improvements will be&#13;
sustained by developing and implementing cost recovery policies, building and utilizing local ca-&#13;
pacity in the public and private sectors, and improving financial management and control; and&#13;
(c) to strengthen donor coordination.&#13;
D.    THE BANK GROUP'S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.9    Since the resumption of Bank lending to Sierra Leone in 1992, IDA, in conjunction with&#13;
various cofinanciers, has provided financial support for the Government's program through a Re-&#13;
construction Import (Credit 2352-SL) and a successor Structural Adjustment (Credit 2546-SL).&#13;
These credits helped implement an economic reform which facilitated macroeconomic stabilization&#13;
and economic activity by financing essential support. A public Sector Management Support Proj-&#13;
ect (Credit 2435-SL) was approved in 1993 to strengthen the Government's capacity to implement&#13;
structural reforms, particularly in the area of fiscal management. Four investment credits to re-&#13;
habilitate infrastructure have been approved to supplement these efforts: the first to rehabilitate&#13;
power supply and distribution (Credit 2356-SL; approved by the Board on April 21, 1992); the&#13;
second (Credit 245 1-SL, US$45.0 million, January 27, 1993) for the Road Rehabilitation and&#13;
Maintenance Project (RRMP), a four-year slice of a seven year road rehabilitation program, at a&#13;
total cost of over US$93 million, and funded by IDA, AfDB, the European Union (EU), and the&#13;
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the third (Credit 251 1-SL, US$26 million, June&#13;
10, 1993) for the Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP), which includes a compo-&#13;
nent to rehabilitate some access roads in Freetown; and the fourth (Credit 2702-SL, US$36 mil-&#13;
lion, April 11, 1995) for the Urban Water Supply Project (UWSP) to rehabilitate and expand the&#13;
water supply and sewerage system in Freetown.&#13;
1.10   IDA's involvement in the TSP is consistent with the broad objectives of the Country As-&#13;
sistance Strategy (CAS) reviewed by the Board on October 14, 1993, which is to establish a&#13;
firm basis for sustained private sector-led economic growvth and poverty reduction. The proposed&#13;
project would directly support the objectives outlined in the CAS by helping to create a supportive&#13;
environment for resumption of normal economic activity, develop the national construction indus-&#13;
try, restructure or privatize the principal sector agencies and improve their management and opera-&#13;
tional efficiency, and support labor-intensive works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.   THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A.    OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1    The country's transport sector consists of: (a) about 11,300 km of roads, of which&#13;
900 km are paved, over 3,200 km are graveled trunk roads, and 7,200 km are feeder and village&#13;
access roads; (b) a poorly maintained, over-aged road vehicle fleet of about 52,000 motor vehicles&#13;
(including motorbikes); (c) a principal sea port located in the capital, Freetown, and two private&#13;
ports, Niti and Pepel, used primarily for mnineral exports; (d) one major intemational airport&#13;
(Lungi) and one domestic/regional airport (Hastings) near Freetown and several minor airfields,&#13;
only two of which are operational; and (e) about 400 km of shallow but navigable river stretches,&#13;
although river transport remains insignificant. Sierra Leone's rail network was phased out during&#13;
the early 1970s when it became uneconormic. The national road network classification, together&#13;
with statistics of the transport sector (vehicles, traffic accidents, port and air transport), are shown&#13;
in Annex 2- 1.&#13;
2.2    Road Infrastructure. The road network is the dominant intemal transport mode account-&#13;
ing for over 80% of the domestic traffic flows, with the rest being carried on waterways. The&#13;
length and coverage of the Sierra Leone's road network is satisfactory. However, the quality re-&#13;
mains below acceptable standards after two decades of neglect and inadequate maintenance largely&#13;
due to lack of funding, poor maintenance practices and institutional weaknesses. The density of the&#13;
total road network at 2.8 km/I000 inhabitants is above the average of 1.17 km for Sub-Sahara Af-&#13;
rica and above the average of 1.20 km in Nigeria and 2.0 km in Ghana. Paved main roads link&#13;
Freetown with most district centers, with the exception of Kabala in the North and Kailahun in the&#13;
East. However, a few fertile rural areas previously served by the now defunct railroad still need&#13;
connections to the road network. Due to t'e past under-allocation of funds for maintenance, nearly&#13;
30% of the paved roads, 55% of the gravel and 70% of the earth roads are rated in poor to very&#13;
poor condition and are near collapse. As a result, the country is estimated to incur an additional&#13;
cost of $35 million per annum in vehicle operating costs, which could be avoided if the roads were&#13;
properly maintained. The former Department of Works (DOW) managed the road network until&#13;
early 1993, when this responsibility was devolved to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA)&#13;
2.3    Road Transport. Road transport is almost entirely operated by small private operators.&#13;
There is free market entry for operator of trucks or passenger vehicles, subject to minimal registra-&#13;
tion and licensing requirements. Passenger fares and freight tariffs in the private sector are not&#13;
regulated in practice, although the tariffs charged by the Sierra Leone Road Transport Corporation&#13;
(SLRTC), a public authority, are subject to Government control. The national vehicle fleet com-&#13;
prises approximately 43,000 vehicles, including about 25,000 private cars, 6,000 taxis, 3,600&#13;
trucks, 1,000 buses and 7,300 jeeps and vans. Most vehicles are imported used; spares are expen-&#13;
sive. Drivers are poorly trained. Many roads and streets are in dire condition. The vehicle fleet is&#13;
poorly maintained and inefficient.&#13;
2.4    The unreliable supply and poor quality of public passenger transport cause considerable&#13;
hardship to the middle and low-income public who must rely on it. While some of the country's&#13;
areas remained isolated during the war, buses are overloaded with long waiting time and frequent&#13;
delays because of breakdowns. These problems are compounded in the Freetown area by lack of&#13;
traffic management and poor road conditions, resulting in constant traffic congestion. It is ex-&#13;
pected that these problems will be alleviated by the current rehabilitation program covering most&#13;
streets in the Commercial Business District (CBD) of Freetown.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.5    SLRTC operates a fleet of 30 buses and currently has less than a 5% share of the passen-&#13;
ger transport. Its buses are operated mostly in Freetown due to the security situation, although&#13;
normally about half would be assigned to inter-city routes. SLRTC's tariffs provide concessional&#13;
rates for school children and women. The corporation operates at a loss due to low tanffs for sev-&#13;
eral services provided as public service obligations, but also because of inefficient management,&#13;
high operating costs partly due to poor road conditions, and a shortage of spares which reduces&#13;
fleet availability. It does not receive revenue subsidies, but the Government has passed on limited&#13;
bilateral assistance in the form of buses, spares and technical assistance to the corporation on con-&#13;
cessional terms. Although SLRTC's performance has improved somewhat during the past two&#13;
years, the overall situation in public passenger transport has worsened because of the influx of&#13;
refugees into Freetown.&#13;
2.6    Non-motorized transport, such as bicycles, cycles trailers and other types, are not widely&#13;
used in Sierra Leone, though they would provide sustainable low-cost transport, particularly for&#13;
the rural and urban poor. The on-going RRMP, financed by IDA and other donors, includes a pi-&#13;
lot component to promote the use of non-motonzed transport based on recent Bank experience in&#13;
Ghana.&#13;
2.7    Port Facilities and Traffic. The main port of Sierra Leone is located in Freetown, in a&#13;
natural harbor which permits a draft of almost 10 meters. There are six public berths (quay length&#13;
1,100 m), five transit sheds and a total area of 32 acres, workshops and a small dockyard Sepa-&#13;
rate dedicated terminals handle petroleum and fish traffic, both of which are also handled at an-&#13;
chorage. Freetown port handles most of the country's general cargo and all of its petroleum import&#13;
traffic. The ports of Niti and Pepel are loading wharves for bulk exports (up to 1.0 million&#13;
tons/year of bauxite and rutile). These exports were interrupted by rebel incursions in early 1995&#13;
and the ports have not been operated since. Total dry cargo traffic through the public berths at&#13;
Freetown in 1995 was 451,000 tons, down from 638,000 tons in 1979. It has been fairly static&#13;
over the last six years. Exports are negligible. Fourteen percent of traffic is in bulk, 56% is con-&#13;
ventional break-bulk; 30%, which is almost all cargo suitable for containers, is containerized. The&#13;
port facilities are in a general need of rehabilitation, specially the main quay, the dockyard, port&#13;
roads and storage areas; some obsolete cargo-handling equipment also needs to be replaced. Op-&#13;
erational performance on cargo handling is average (400 tons per ship day on general cargo, 600 to&#13;
900 tons on bags, 10 to 12 containers per hour), but not markedly low by the standards of similar&#13;
ports on the West African Coast.&#13;
2.8    Port Administration. Since 1964, the port of Freetown is managed by the Sierra Leone&#13;
Ports Authority (SLPA). established as a statutory public corporation administered by a Board of&#13;
Directors, to develop and operate the port in the public interest. It is also responsible for all marine&#13;
and shore services in the country and has some regulatory role in maritime administration. It is&#13;
under close supervision of MTCE. SLPA operates the port as a service port, conducting pilotage,&#13;
stevedoring, cargo handling and storage on force account and has its own workshop and slipway.&#13;
Niti and Pepel were operated by the mining companies, which paid pilotage fees and channel dues&#13;
to the SLPA. SLPA has been managed for nearly ten years under a consultancy, advisory and&#13;
training services contract with foreign consultants. Expatriates are still in most of SLPA's execu-&#13;
tive positions. IDA reviewed SLPA's management during the implementation of the RIC and found&#13;
it to be in need of restructuring and improvement as discussed in Chapter 5.&#13;
2.9    Ferry Services. By order of Government, SLPA operates and finances the ferry service&#13;
between Freetown and Tagrin (about 8 kIn), which provides a vital link between the capital and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Lungi International Airport and the north-west region. The alternative to this ferry service is a&#13;
180-km road detour via Masiaka and Port Loko. The fleet has consisted of two 600-ton ferries&#13;
dating from 1981, both of which have recently been retired from service, and one fairly moden&#13;
second hand vessel (486 tons) purchased in 1993 from Greece. 210 employees from SLPA work in&#13;
ferry services (19% of the SLPA workforce). Two additional passenger ferries are needed to en-&#13;
sure continued adequate services. The Government plans to commission a feasibility study, to be&#13;
financed by AfDB, of a shorter road to Lungi, by-passing Port Loko; this would reduce the road&#13;
distance to the airport to 100 kIn, and would necessitate the construction of two bridges. Con-&#13;
struction would be a major project and its economic viability will have to be considered careflly.&#13;
2.10   Shipping and Manitime Administration. The government-owned Sierra Leone National&#13;
Shipping Companv (SLNSC) now operates only as a shipping agent, freight forwarder and slot&#13;
charterer in competition with private firms. It collects from importers and shippers a freight levy&#13;
of US$1.50 per ton of cargo on imports and US$0.60 per ton of export, based on the 1965 Geneva&#13;
Convention (Code of Conduct of Conferences). The levy, which had been used to finance Mari-&#13;
time Administration expenses, is no longer used for this purpose and now accrues to general reve-&#13;
nues.&#13;
2.11   Coastal and River Transport This form of transport is used to barge bauxite and rutile&#13;
ores from Niti to Sherbro Island for transshipment to ocean-going vessels; and to serve the Kambia&#13;
and Port Loko districts of the Northem region. Its share of the domestic transportation market has&#13;
increased to around 20% especially since road transport has been constrained by rebel activities. It&#13;
is estimated that total navigable distance is 400 km for vessels of 2.0 meter draft throughout the&#13;
year, taking advantage of favorable tides. Also, Pampers (local boats) are operated by several&#13;
small private operators and are not regulated. No operating data are available on this mode of&#13;
transport. A study recently completed by consultants recommended a program for the rehabilita-&#13;
tion and construction of jetties and landing sites, including training for proper maintenance of the&#13;
facilities and safe operations of vessels.&#13;
2.12   Air Transport. Sierra Leone's only intemational airport is located at Lungi, reached&#13;
mainly by a one-hour ferry/road connection from Freetown. Lungi Intemational Airport is man-&#13;
aged by the Sierra Leone Airports Authority (SLAA), a statutory corporation established in 1988&#13;
with UNDP assistance. SLAA is managed efficiently and is operating on a commercial basis at a&#13;
profit. However, extensive repair and modermization of navigational aids, landing lights, pavement&#13;
and perimeter fencing are urgently required.&#13;
2.13   After two decades of steady growth, international air traffic has declined from 133,000 in&#13;
1991 to 113,000 passengers in 1994 because of the prevailing insecurity. Intemational travel is&#13;
offered by two major international carriers, KLM and Sabana, and EAS, which exploits the traffic&#13;
rights of the Sierra National Airlines (SNA). Several regional African airlines provide service to&#13;
the neighboring countries. Due to the security situation, intemal air travel services by helicopter&#13;
are currently available between Freetown and a few other major towns.&#13;
B.    TRANSPORT SECrOR ORGANIZATION&#13;
2.14 Private and Public Sector Roles. The private sector is dominant in the road and coastal&#13;
and river transport subsectors. Except for the extended management contract, the private sector&#13;
plays no role in the port sector; it is represented in the shipping subsector by shipping and forward-&#13;
ing agents. The public sector is currently responsible for road construction and maintenance with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
major works camred out by private, mostly foreign, contractors. It manages ports and airports,&#13;
including commercial activities such as stevedoring in port and aircraft handling in airports. It has&#13;
small shares in freight forwarding (SLNSC), intemational air transport (SNA), and road transport&#13;
(SLRTC). With the exception of SLRTC, all transport parastatals operate at a profit, and withut&#13;
direct subsidies from the Government, but inadequate maintenance and renewal of equipmat have&#13;
resulted in decapitalization.&#13;
2.15   Sector Administration. Transport sector administration was, until recently, divided be-&#13;
tween the Department of Transport and Communications (DOTC), which supervises SLPA,&#13;
SLAA, SLRTC and SLNSC and has responsibility for civil aviation, and the Department of Works&#13;
(DOW) which oversees SLRA. Under the recently elected democratic Government, the DOTC has&#13;
been transformed into the new Ministry of Transport, Communications and the Environment&#13;
(MTCE) that will oversee all public transport sector entities, except SLRA which is under the new&#13;
Ministry of Works and Technical Maintenance (MWTM). MTCE is charged with initiating poli-&#13;
cies, regulations, and transport sector development plans for the country. With Bank assistance&#13;
through Project Preparation Facilities (P-872-SL and 872-1-SL), MTCE's Coordination and&#13;
Monitoring Unit (CMU) has been strengthened and its supervisory role has correspondingly besn&#13;
enhanced and made more effective.&#13;
2.16   The reform of Sierra Leone's road sector management has become a model in Africa, par-&#13;
ticularly with (a) the creation of a commercially-oriented organization responsible for road man-&#13;
agement, and (b) the creation of a road fund, financed from user charges/fuel levy, to cover the cost&#13;
of road maintenance. The former DOW administered public roads until 1992/93 when this re-&#13;
sponsibility was devolved to the newly established SLRA in a far-reaching road sector reform pro-&#13;
gram supported by IDA under the RRMP. DOW was overstaffed at the non-professional level,&#13;
with about 12,000 staff in January 1992. Excess staff at DOW have been retrenched. It now has&#13;
less than 1,000 employees. Some engineers and technicians have been employed by SLRA, while&#13;
others have become small maintenance contractors. The organization, managaeent and finances of&#13;
SLRA, SLAA and SLPA are discussed in Chapter 5.&#13;
C.    FiSCAL ISSUES AND AFFORDABaIrry&#13;
2.17   To estimate the financial contribution of the transport sector to the economy, the revenues&#13;
generated by the various parastatals were calculated. In 1994/95, the sector as a whole generated&#13;
about US$13 million and about US$1 million equivalent in gross and net revenues for services&#13;
provided by SLPA, SLAA, SLNSC, and SLRTC. However, revenue generation is misleading&#13;
since it results partly from lack of maintenance and renewal of facilities and equipment. In fact,&#13;
there is loss of substance and decapitalization. There are no subsidies from the govenment to the&#13;
sector organizations; however, SLRTC received funds in 1994 from the Freight Levy for the pur-&#13;
chase of buses, thus obtaining an indirect subsidy. But SLPA has been subsidizing the Govem-&#13;
ment for years (in some cases through tax compensation) by financing ferry acquisition and making&#13;
good for the deficit of ferry operations. There is no formal agreement between the Government and&#13;
SLPA, which is lacking for management purposes. While the sector as a whole is a net contributor&#13;
to the economy, the revenues generated could be substantially increased.&#13;
2.18   Road Fund. A Road Fund was initially set up in 1989 through a cabinet decision to fi-&#13;
nance road maintenance work nationwide through various user fees. It was subsequently incorpo-&#13;
rated in the SLRA Act in 1992, which stipulated the creation of this Road Fund for the collection&#13;
of: (a) road user charges levy on fuel; (b) vehicle licensing fees; (c) vehicle registration fees; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
(d) any other road user charges that may from time to time be allocated to the fund by law, toll&#13;
charges, for instance. The proceeds from this fund are intended specifically to defray expenses for&#13;
routine, periodic and emergency road maintenance. It was anticipated that rehabilitation and re-&#13;
construction and backlog maintenance would be supported by foreign funding, while road user fees&#13;
would cover all regular maintenance needs of the network. As agreed under the RRMP, fuel levy&#13;
was raised to US $0.08 per liter equivalent (or Le 200 per Ig) in December 1994. But with the&#13;
depreciation of the Leone since then, the fuel levy has now been reduced to US$0.05 per liter&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
2.19   The current revenue of the Road Fund is inadequate for financing routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance of the road network; it is estimated that the current levy would only cover 30-50% of&#13;
the planned ten year maintenance program of the national road system, totaling 8,200 km. It&#13;
should be noted that this levy does not cover the routine and periodic maintenance costs of local&#13;
roads and streets, totaling 3,000 km. An analysis of the revenue structure of the Road Fund is&#13;
shown in Chapter 5.&#13;
2.20   At present, the fuel levy is the sole source of funding for the Road Fund, other fees are&#13;
collected by the Road Transport Department (RTD) of MTCE for vehicle examination and com-&#13;
mercial authorization, and the Police Department for license, registration and issuance of driver's&#13;
licenses. The collection system for various fees is inefficient and inadequate. To overcome the&#13;
limitations imnposed by an uncoordinated system of fee collection and to establish the linkage be-&#13;
tween road usage and road maintenance expenditure, the Government is proposing the following&#13;
changes: (a) the collection of various road transport fees by different agencies will be transferred&#13;
and undertaken by the new Road Transport Authority (RTA), and (b) vehicle related user charges,&#13;
such as vehicle registration, vehicle exammnation arid license fees, will be channeled into the Road&#13;
Fund beginning January 1, 1997.&#13;
D.    LESSONS LEARNED FROM BANK GROUP AND OTHER DONORS&#13;
2.21   The Bank has financed three operations in the transport sector, all highway projects, which&#13;
were signed in 1971, 1981 and 1993. The First Highway Project financed the construction of the&#13;
Bo-Kenema road and the first phase of a road maintenance program. The project experienced de-&#13;
lays and cost overruns. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) in 1978 noted an ex-post&#13;
economic return of 25%, higher than at appraisal, and that the project's achievements in routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance were far below targets. The Second Highway Project focused on the&#13;
rehabilitation of 800 km of trunk roads and on improving routine and periodic maintenance, with&#13;
cofinancing from AfDB and the OPEC Fund. The project was completed in 1988, after delays and&#13;
suspensions due to the Government's defaults in repayment of past debts. The Project Completion&#13;
Report (PCR) in 1991 noted that only about 55% of the physical works were completed, with long&#13;
delays in execution, poor performance by the Borrower and serious interruptions in counterpart&#13;
funding. However, a post-evaluation of the resealed and regravelled roads indicated a satisfactory&#13;
economic intemal rate of return (ERR) of 60%.&#13;
2.22   The ongoing RRMP, with cofinancing from AfDB, EU, and UNDP, focuses on trunk road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance, strengthening of road management institutions, promotion of pilot&#13;
non-motorized transport and support to transport sector institutions. It took account of the lessons&#13;
leamed from previous operations including: establishment of an autonomous commercially-&#13;
oriented agency with substantially reduced labor force (SLRA); creation and maintenance of a road&#13;
fund to ensure adequacy and timeliness of counterpart funding; and providing for a shift from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
maintenance by force account to maintenance by contract and for training of domestic contractors.&#13;
Project implementation has been on schedule, except for two major road contracts having been&#13;
terminated due to rebel attacks.&#13;
2.23   Building on the successful expenrences of the RRMP, the proposed transport sector in-&#13;
vestment project will deepen and reinforce the reforms already achieved or in progress in the road&#13;
subsector and will generalize the approach to the rest of the transport sector. The main lessons&#13;
include, the establishment of commercially oriented, semi-autonomous authorities for each of the&#13;
transport subsectors, with management shielded from political interference and with sustained&#13;
budgetary resources derived from user fees on the use of transport infrastructures, adequate staff&#13;
compensation and incentives, emphasis on coitract execution of works and subcontracting to the&#13;
private sector, and introduction of labor intensive maintenance methods. Technical assistance is&#13;
being provided for line positions with time-based plans for transfer of knowledge to local staff.&#13;
Emphasis is on cost recovery and enhancement of the transport sector coordination and monitoring&#13;
capacity.&#13;
2.24   Donor coordination has been improving through existing cofinancing arrangements. It has&#13;
been further strengthened during the preparation of the proposed TSP through donor meetings with&#13;
the Government and stakeholders in 1994 and 1995. The Government will organize similar confer-&#13;
ences each year to streamline dialogue with donors and report on progress of implementation of the&#13;
proposed project, review projected plans for subsequent years, and to seek additional funding. The&#13;
Government intends to adopt common arrangements for implementation, monitoring, accounting,&#13;
and reporting for all donor assisted project components. Understanding has been reached that these&#13;
common arrangements will be detailed in the project implementation manual and reviewed with&#13;
IDA before being presented to the donors at the first donor conference scheduled before December&#13;
1, 1996.&#13;
3.    TRANSPORT SECTOR POLICY&#13;
A.    OVERALL TRANSPORT SECTOR POLICY&#13;
3. 1    In June 1994, the Government of Sierra Leone organized a workshop to develop a national&#13;
transport sector policy. The workshop included all major stakeholders -- Government, parastatals,&#13;
private sector and intemational donors -- having a stake in the development of Sierra Leone's&#13;
transport sector. The workshop was highly participative and resulted in a basic consensus on the&#13;
majors goals and objectives for each transport subsector (road infrastructure, road transport, water&#13;
transport and air transport). Based on this consensus, DOTC's Planning Unit completed in March&#13;
1995, after reviews by the major stakeholders, a draft National Transport Policy, consistent with&#13;
national economic reforms objectives, and compatible with available domestic and intemational aid&#13;
resources. The National Transport Policy presents the Government's medium-term objectives and&#13;
action plan for the sector. It was approved by the Government and presented to a Donors' Meeting&#13;
in June 1995. It is the basis for the Transport Policy Letter, dated April 24, 1996, shown in An-&#13;
nex 3-1, and for the four-year investment program for the transport sector discussed in Chapter 4.&#13;
3.2    The overall goal of the National Transport Sector Policy is to rehabilitate the transport&#13;
infrastructure, and transform it into an efficient, reliable, safe, environment-friendly, equitable and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
self-reliant system, capable of supporting a sustainable private-sector led economic growth, assist-&#13;
ing in poverty alleviation and rehabilitation of the war-affected areas.&#13;
3.3    The Government's main objectives are to put the management and financing of the roads,&#13;
road transport, ports, and airport, on a sustainable long-term basis, managed with commercial&#13;
principle and to clear the large backlog of rehabilitation and maintenance works in the transport&#13;
infrastructure systemn. To this end, it has adopted the following objectives: (i) clear the backlog of&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network an increase labor-intensive works; (ii) base&#13;
transport sub-sector investment decisions on economic and environmental analyses; (iii) ensure&#13;
adequacy of funds for routine and penodic maintenance via user charges; (iv) improve cost recov-&#13;
ery in all transport sector parastatals to ensure sustainability; (v) vigorously promote private sector&#13;
participation in the execution of works and delivery of transport services; (vi) reduce dependence&#13;
on foreign technical assistance and increase training and perfonnance of local staff; (vii) improve&#13;
capacity to assess the financial, economic and environmental impacts of alternate transport infra-&#13;
structure investment strategies; (viii) streamline regulations and effectively enforce them; (ix) cre-&#13;
ate institutional capacity to monitor, collect, and analyze transport data and information; (x) create&#13;
capacity for sector coordination, policy formulation and planning; and (xi) strengthen donor coor-&#13;
dination.&#13;
B.     INSTITUTIONAL REFORM&#13;
3.4   In order to improve the overall operational efficiency and service quality of the transport&#13;
sector, the Government's goal is to re-engineer the sector, based on a new definition of the respec-&#13;
tive roles of Government, commercially-run autonomous agencies and the private sector. In such a&#13;
concept, the Government no longer is directly involved in running transport services, unless they&#13;
are strategic or there is no private candidate to perform these services. The role of the Government&#13;
is redefined to: (i) a regulating role, seting up and enforcing a clear set of standards and regula-&#13;
tions pertaining to safety, energy, environmental protection, as well as market entry and exit condi-&#13;
tions and competition rules; (ii) a provider of basic infrastructure (as opposed to transport serv-&#13;
ices); and (iii) developing the transport policy. Regulatory functions are performed by semi-&#13;
autonomous agencies funded by user fees, with users represented on the Boards. Basic infrastruc-&#13;
ture services are provided on a commercial basis by existing parastatals. Transport services would&#13;
be commercialized or privatized, whenever feasible.&#13;
3.5   In the new organizational setting, the primary role of the MTCE will be to develop and&#13;
oversee transport policy and to coordinate and monitor semi-autonomous agencies, each responsi-&#13;
ble for a transport mode. Its current organizational structure is shown in Annex 3-2. The Ministry&#13;
would be streamlined to a CMU, a number of semi-autonomous transport sector agencies and&#13;
authorities, and an Environmental Department. The terms of reference of the CMU are included in&#13;
the Project Files.&#13;
3.6    As mentioned in para. 2.15, the transport sector organization of Sierra Leone has already&#13;
been substantially modernized through staff reduction and the creation of semi-autonomous com-&#13;
mercial authorities in charge of the key transport subsectors for roads, ports and airports. How-&#13;
ever, in the past, the capacity to develop sector policies and to coordinate and oversee the activities&#13;
of the authorities by the parent ministries was very limited. Efforts, which were made under&#13;
RRMP to enhance the capacity of the Planning Unit at the former DOTC failed to aclieve signifi-&#13;
cant results. The lack of a transport sector policy and of oversight capacity by the previous parent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
rninistnres led to uncoordinated plans in the various transport subsectors, with potential conflicts&#13;
and waste of investments.&#13;
C.    RESOURCE MOBILIZATION&#13;
3.7    Road Fund revenues collected from users intended for road maintenance expenditure will&#13;
increase with the inflow of fees associated with the possession of vehicles and fuel levy collections.&#13;
As indicated in paras 5.5 to 5. 11 , it is estimated that the average annual maintenance require-&#13;
ments of the existing road network would be in the range of US$11.5-14.5 million. Assuming that&#13;
the secun'ty situation in the country is normal, and there is a modest growth in traffic of 4% over&#13;
1996-2005, projected Road Fund revenues would be sufficient to meet road maintenance require-&#13;
ments by the year 2005, assuming a largely rehabilitated network.&#13;
3.8    SLAA's landing fee rates and other levies are already relatively high. SLPA is charging&#13;
rates for berthing, pilotage and other services, that are close to the maximum. A new tariff struc-&#13;
ture is being reviewed in consultation with users. It is not possible to increase revenues via in-&#13;
crease in rates for services; total revenues for the SLAA and SLPA will increase with an increase&#13;
in the traffic when the overall economic situation in the country improves.&#13;
3.9    As part of the new transport sector policy effort, the Government plans to establish a Re-&#13;
source Mobilization Committee, comprising representatives of MTCE, and the Ministnes of Fi-&#13;
nance, Planning and Economic Development, and Foreign Affairs and Intemational Cooperation, to&#13;
review transport sector investment and maintenance programs and seek funding locally and inter-&#13;
nationally.&#13;
D.    PROMOTION OF PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
3 10 A key objective of the Government's Transport Sector Policy is greater participation of the&#13;
private sector in the execution of works and the provision of transport services. This would be&#13;
achieved through a reduction in transport activities undertaken by Govemment parastatals and&#13;
through changes in the regulatory framework governing sector activities. Specific objectives and&#13;
actions regarding private sector development or privatization for the various transport subsectors&#13;
are discussed in the ensuing sections. This includes further development of labor-based and me-&#13;
dium-size contractors for routine and periodic road maintenance and road works, contracting out&#13;
repairs of government vehicles and privatization of transport entities. MTCE has prepared action&#13;
plans for pnvatizing SLRTC and SNA and an updated schedule for the ongoing pnrvatization of&#13;
SLNSC Agreements have been reached on these action plans and their implementation schedule.&#13;
privatization of SLRTC is expected by June 30, 1997; SNA by March 31, 1997; and SLNSC by&#13;
December 31, 1996&#13;
E.    TRANSPORT SUBSECTOR POLICIES&#13;
3.11   Road Infrastructure. The principal goal for road infrastructure subsector is to rehabili-&#13;
tate the national road system to an acceptable level of serviceability and to maintain it in good&#13;
condition, so that it can fulfill its strategic role in the development of the national and local&#13;
economies. The main objectives of SLRA are: (i) to have the entire National Road System under a&#13;
regular, sustainable program of routine and periodic maintenance by 2005; (ii) to bring at least&#13;
60% of the pnrmary network (2,000 km) to a paved standard and at least 60% of the secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
network to all-weather standard; (iii) to complete the Sierra Leonean portion of the Trans-West&#13;
Africa Highway to adequate paved standard by the year 2010; (iv) to complete the construction of&#13;
permanent bridges, where economic, on all main roads by 2005; and (v) to continue to upgrade the&#13;
tertiary network to gravel surfacing to improve year-around access to important agricultural and&#13;
mineral productive areas.&#13;
3.12   There has been some capacity increase in the private construction industry with the train-&#13;
ing of ten labor based contractors under the ongoing IDA-financed Agricultural Sector Support&#13;
Project (Credit 1501 -SL). Under the new policy, SLRA will continue to move from force account&#13;
to contract execution of works and further encourage the development of small domestic firms ca-&#13;
pable of bidding on small routine and periodic maintenance contracts involving labor-intensive&#13;
works. To encourage the development of small contracting firms, bids will be called for on a con-&#13;
sistent basis. This will provide firms with the incentive to gradually build up small equipment&#13;
holdings, so that they can eventually bid for larger works. This would be accompanied by continu-&#13;
ing the current personnel training and hiring out of tools and equipment to develop such firms.&#13;
Routine maintenance is executed almost entirely by one-man contractors. The proposed project&#13;
would support the development of another ten labor-based contractors and medium-size contrac-&#13;
tors. Up to 90% of the planned periodic maintenance program will eventually be executed by these&#13;
contractors.&#13;
3.13   With respect to road user fees and cost recovery, the Government will adjust and monitor&#13;
closely fuel levy revenues and examine the adequacy of the levy level, and gradually adjust road&#13;
user charges to fully cover the costs of routine and periodic maintenance (paras. 5.5 to 5 .1 1 ).&#13;
3.14   Road Transport. Under the new policy, the main objectives for road transport are: (i) to&#13;
set up a new autonomous RTA financed by user fees and responsible for developing and imple-&#13;
menting the road transport policy, specifying vehicle standards licensing of dnrvers, vehicles and&#13;
transport services firms, monitoring the subsector and pricing policies, (ii) to establish a clear set&#13;
of safety, energy and environmental standards, and traffic regulations; (iii) to develop comprehen-&#13;
sive and effective enforcement programs for violations of road-related laws and standards, (iv) to&#13;
encourage the growth of the private sector in road transport services, private maintenance and in-&#13;
spection services and contracting of maintenance services for government vehicles and through the&#13;
privatization of SLRTC. The organizational structure of RTA is shown in Annex 3-3.&#13;
3.15   Maritime and Water Transport. The main objectives under the new policy are: (i) to&#13;
redefine the role of Government in the subsector as regulator and provider of basic infrastructure&#13;
services and delegate to a semi-autonomous Marine Services Administration the coordination and&#13;
regulation of all marine, coastal and inland water transport activities; (ii) to improve the efficiency&#13;
of SLPA, including reorganization of the authority into autonomous profit centers or companies&#13;
(maritime services, harbour operations, ship repair, ferry), and the commercialization and/or pos-&#13;
sible privatization of certain services; (iii) to improve cost recovery of maritime administration;&#13;
(iv) to comply with intemational maritime standards and inmprove intemational maritime coopera-&#13;
tion; (v) to complete the privatization of SLNSC, and (vi) to rehabilitate the coastal and river&#13;
transport infrastructure, where feasible.&#13;
3.16   Air Transport. The main objectives under the new policy are: (i) to reorganize the&#13;
overall administration of the air transport subsector by restructuring the MTCE's Directorate of&#13;
Civil Aviation and transforming it into a semi-autonomous Civil Aviation Agency, to be financed&#13;
from aviation-related users fees; (ii) to strengthen the SLAA as a semi-autonomous, commercial,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
self-sustained provider of airport infrastructure services with funding based on airport users fees;&#13;
(iii) unbundle functions that can be more efficiently contracted out to the private sector, (iv) to re-&#13;
habilitate and maintain Lungi Intemational Airport to Intemational Civil Aviation Organization&#13;
(ICAO) safety standards; (iv) to improve security and safety at Hastings and remaining operational&#13;
airfields, whenever it is cost-effective; and (v) to privatize SNA.&#13;
4.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A.    INTRODUCrION&#13;
4.1    A ten-year investment program for the transport sector has been prepared by the various&#13;
government agencies, sector parastatals and authorities on the basis of the National Transport&#13;
Policy, and discussed during the June 1995 Donors' Conference (para. 3.1) with various stake-&#13;
holders and donors active in the sector. While there is no full consensus on the longer term vision&#13;
and expenditure program of each of the implementing agencies, there is wide agreement on the pri-&#13;
orities in first four years, which include priority rehabilitation expenditures and investments. This&#13;
Transport Sector Investment Program, therefore, includes all the investments planned for the initial&#13;
four-year 1996-1999 period for the road, port, airport and water transport subsectors, on which&#13;
agreement could be reached.&#13;
B.    PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.2    The overall aims of the Program are: (a) to support the implementation of the new trans-&#13;
port sector policy as enunciated in the Letter of Sector Policy (Annex 3-1); (b) to build local ca-&#13;
pacity by expanding the successful process of institutional reform and strengthening; (c) to further&#13;
enhance sector planning and coordination through MTCE, (d) to further support stakeholder par-&#13;
ticipation and an integrated approach to all sector investments financed by intemal and extemal&#13;
sources; (e) to promote private participation in transport activities, including road network mainte-&#13;
nance by private, small and medium enterprises; (f) to enhance managemnent of road transport and&#13;
alleviate urban traffic congestion; (g) to improve maritime transport by preserving existing port&#13;
capacity, improving its management, and promoting coastal and river transport; and (h) to sustain&#13;
investments and enhance air traffic safety at Lungi airport.&#13;
C.    PROGRAM DESCRIPTION, COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.3    The four-year Program comprises investments and maintenance with total estimated cost&#13;
of about US$299.0 million equivalent, excluding physical and price contingencies. The detailed&#13;
cost estimates of the program investments and indicative financing plan are shown in Annex 4-1&#13;
and summarized in Table 4.1 below. The main components of the Program are summarized in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;

4.4      Financing of this four-year investment program is summarized in Table 4.2 below. The&#13;
total funds already committed or earmarked from external sources would amount to US$93.3 mil-&#13;
lion equivalent, including IDA funds of US$49.5 million equivalent. IDA contribution comprises&#13;
about US$19.4 million committed for ongoing projects (JU*MP, ASSP, FIRP), and the proposed&#13;
credit of US$35 million equivalent (US$30.1 million base cost). There is a gap of US$131 million&#13;
to be bridged by external donors. This gap could not be filled at appraisal since major donors have&#13;
withheld assistance until the installation of a democratically elected government. The Government&#13;
has resumed discussions with donors and it is expected that this gap will be filled over the next two&#13;
years. Should it be impossible to fill the entire funding gap, the TSP would not be in jeopardy&#13;
since most components are independent.&#13;
4.5      Financing by the various transport authorities and the Government would total&#13;
US$74 million, including counterpart funds for yet unsecured external funding. It is estimated that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
about US$40 million would come from road user charges, fuel levy and license fees, deposited in&#13;
the road fund in order to finance routine and periodic maintenance of the roads. Counterpart funds&#13;
required from the development budget amount to about US$27 rmillion and are well covered by the&#13;
sector revenues raised through an excise tax on fuel and import duty on fuel and vehlcles, estimated&#13;
at more than US$20 million annually (Annex 5-2). The remaining US$2.8 mnillion and&#13;
US$0.8 mnillion will be financed by the SLPA and the SLAA, respectively.&#13;

4.6     Sector Administration. The CMU at MTCE will be strengthened through trained man-&#13;
power and by the creation of an advisory unit employed on a contract basis and paid competitive&#13;
salaries. The CMU will oversee the transport sector, establishing standards, guidelines and code of&#13;
conduct, and more particularly review the Transport Sector Policy and morutor its implementation,&#13;
and ensure sector donor coordination. The CMU will be equipped (office equipment, computers,&#13;
vehicles) to deliver its tasks, and funds will be made available for studies in the sector Cost of&#13;
specific items supported by the program, including studies for the preparation of the project, are&#13;
estimated at US$2.1 million and are financed by IDA and the Government.&#13;
4.7     Road Infrastructure. SLRA's four-year investment program includes: rehabilita-&#13;
tion/reconstruction of 482 km of main roads, paving of 62 km of major gravel roads, deferred peri-&#13;
odic maintenance on 227 km of main roads, rehabilitation/periodic maintenance of 1,313 km of&#13;
gravel main roads, spot improvements on some 1,990 km of feeder roads, improvement of 165 km&#13;
of urban roads. These investments would all be extemally financed with the Govemment providing&#13;
counterpart funding estimated at 10% of total costs. In addition, SLRA would finance entirely and&#13;
carry out annual routine and periodic maintenance campaigns covering an ever increasing portion&#13;
of the road network so that full coverage would be expected in the year 2005.&#13;
4.8     The four-year program includes technical assistance financed by EU, IJNDP, and IDA to&#13;
support further development of SLRA's capacity and implementation of proposed structural re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
forms that would transform the existing Equipment and Supplies Department, which supports force&#13;
account operations, initially into a self-accounting profit center, and a commercial entity in a sec-&#13;
ond phase. Other "software" components of the program include development of contractors, ex-&#13;
pansion of training schools facilities and training program, as well as consultancy services for&#13;
studies, design and supervision of works.&#13;
4.9    Total base cost of the four-year road program is estimated to be US$272 million equiva-&#13;
lent, of which the Government is expected to contribute US$69 million, mainly from the proceeds&#13;
of the Road Fund, for the annual routine and periodic maintenance campaigns, and for counterpart&#13;
funding, while the remaining funds are expected to come from donor contributions. US$78 mnillion&#13;
out of US$203 rmillion to be financed extemally have already been secured, of which US$63.8 mil-&#13;
lion represents the estimated cost of completing operations that have already started under ongoing&#13;
IDA-financed projects.&#13;
4.10   Road Transport. To support the objectives relative to road transport, the proposed proj-&#13;
ect will finance the physical installation of RTA, vehicles and equipment, short term technical as-&#13;
sistance for the installation of management tools, road transport studies, and training/workshops&#13;
for RTA personnel. Total cost for the creation and equipping of the authority is about US$1 mil-&#13;
lion. Operating costs will be supported by road user fees. To improve traffic flow inside the con-&#13;
gested Freetown, priority traffic management measures amounting to US$2 million have been&#13;
identified and will be implemented.&#13;
4.11   Freetown Port. The Freetown port rehabilitation component aims at preserving the exist-&#13;
ing port infrastructure in order to decrease operating cost of SLPA and to put it into a position to&#13;
maintain its infrastructure sustainably with its own funds. Total investments required are esti-&#13;
mated to be US$9.9 million which include deferred maintenance of the quays, placing a heavy duty&#13;
paving on the container stacking areas and internal roadways to cope with container loads up to&#13;
40 tons, and urgent rehabilitation of the slipway at Clinetown whose current condition does not&#13;
allow the maintenance of the ferries. The focus of the component is placed on rehabilitating the&#13;
existing port facilities and, where necessary, on strengthening them to cope with the containeriza-&#13;
tion of marine transport, without increasing port capacity.&#13;
4.12 Coastal and River Transport. A study has been carried out to determine short- and long-&#13;
term investments for the development of coastal and river transport. The short-term investment&#13;
program provides for about 37 storage buildings and 9 piers suitable for pampers (local boats) at&#13;
35 selected landing sites for an estimated cost of US$2.1 million.&#13;
4.13   Lungi AirporL The Lungi Airport rehabilitation program is estimated to cost&#13;
US$5.4 million. It focuses primarily on items that are security related and are necessary to bring&#13;
the airport to ICAO standards, without increasing the capacity. The component includes: commu-&#13;
nications and navigational equipment; aerodrome and ground aids; runway improvement; rehabili-&#13;
tation and improvements of the terminal and the cargo buildings; runway lighting; purchase of res-&#13;
cue equipment comprising a rescue boat, ambulance and fire-fighting equipment; and office equip-&#13;
ment, vehicles, and training.&#13;

D.    THE PROPOSED TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
1.     Project Objectives&#13;
4.14   The development objectives of the proposed TSP are: (a) transport policy: support the&#13;
implementation of the new sector policy and strategy; (b) capacity building: expand the successful&#13;
home-grown process of institutional reform and strengthening; and (c) emnployment generation:&#13;
increase the use of labor-intensive methods in road works and road maintenance. The specific&#13;
project aims are (a) sector/investment planning: further enhance planning and coordination&#13;
through MTCE, and support a sector-wide approach to all investments financed by intemal and&#13;
extemal sources, (b) private participation: economically maintain the road network through pn-&#13;
vate, small and medium size enterprises, (c) regulatory capacity: enhance management of road&#13;
transport and alleviate urban traffic congestion; (d) maritime transport: preserve existing port ca-&#13;
pacity, reduce operating costs and promote coastal and river transport; and (e) civil aviation&#13;
safety: preserve investments and enhance air traffic safety at Lungi International Airport.&#13;
2.     Project Description&#13;
4. 15   The proposed project will support a four year time-slice (1996-1999) of the Govemment's&#13;
ten year sector investment program and will have three main components. A detailed descnrption of&#13;
the project is shown in Annex 4-2.&#13;
(a)    capacity building to:&#13;
(l)    build up the CMU of MTCE for a period of three years, including an ad-&#13;
visory group comprising Sierra Leonean personnel (including a transport&#13;
economist, an accountant/financial analyst, an environmental coordinator,&#13;
a statistician, and support personnel), and operating costs until arrange-&#13;
ments are completed by MTCE to ensure its sustainable financing,&#13;
(ui)   support a new autonomous RTA including studies for its creation, reha-&#13;
bilitation/construction of office facilities, provision of essential equipment,&#13;
short-term technical assistance and training/workshops for staff; and&#13;

the Westem part of the country reserved for bidding by labor based con-&#13;
tractors who have been developed and trained under ongoing projects and&#13;
reshaping and regraveling works on main roads available for bidding by&#13;
medium size contractors. While 40% of the routine maintenance and none&#13;
of the periodic maintenance works are being executed by contractors in&#13;
1996, it is planned to increase overall private sector execution of road&#13;
maintenance to about 90% in 1999;&#13;
(b)    parastatal restructuring to:&#13;
(l)    improve the organizational structure of SLRA including: creation of a Fi-&#13;
nance Department and transformation of the Equipment Division in a first&#13;
phase into an a semi-autonomous profit center Plant Pool hiring out or&#13;

leasing equipment to contractors; and a study to further commnercialize&#13;
and pnrvatize the Plant Pool;&#13;
(ii)   restructure SLPA. including a study to restructure SLPA and the ferry&#13;
operations including plans and legal documents, the possible devolution&#13;
and/or privatization of some of its functions, such as cargo handling and&#13;
storage and the slipway and marine workshop, and restructuring of Free-&#13;
town-Tagrin ferry operations; and&#13;
(iii)   privatize SLRTC, SNA and SLNSC including the carrying out of time-&#13;
bound action plans for their privatization.&#13;
(c)   investment to include:&#13;
(i)    road maintenance including: the overlaying of the 15 km Tagrin -Lungi&#13;
Airport Road; reshaping and regravelling works on the 62 km Lungi-Port&#13;

age buildings and 9 piers suitable for pampers (local boats) at 35 selected&#13;
landing locations and their detailed engineering and supervision.&#13;
3.     Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
4 16   The estimated costs of the proposed IDA-financed components, including duties and taxes,&#13;
are shown in Annex 4-3. A summary of the project costs together with the financing plan are&#13;
shown in Table 4.3 below.&#13;
4.17   Total project cost including physical and price contingencies amounts to US$4 1.0 rnillion,&#13;
including US$31.2 million in foreign exchange and US$9.8 million equivalent in local currency. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
would be financed by a proposed IDA credit of US$35 million equivalent; the balance would be&#13;
financed by intemally generated resources of SLPA and SLAA for their respective port and airport&#13;
components, and by Government contribution for road works, road transport, and coastal and river&#13;
transport. Part of the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be passed on to MTCE&#13;
(US$3.0 million) and SLRA  (US$21.2 million). The remaining balance would be on-lent to SLPA&#13;
(US$8.3 million) and SLAA (US$2.5 million) for 20 years including a grace penrod of 5 years at&#13;
6.9% interest rate per annum. SLPA and SLAA would bear the foreign exchange risk. This fi-&#13;
nancing plan was confirmed dunng the negotiations. Agreement has been obtained that the Gov-&#13;
ernment will establish a Project Account in the name of SLRA for the implementation of the road&#13;
works, road transport and coastal and river transport components with an initial deposit of Le 100&#13;
million pnor to credit effectiveness, and, thereafter, make quarterly payments into this account for&#13;
counterpart funding&#13;

E.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.     Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.18   Two Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs 872-SL and 872-1-SL) have been effective since&#13;
the beginning of 1995 and most of the preparation activities are being financed by them. A Tech-&#13;
nical Coordinator, who heads the CMU of MTCE, oversees the preparatory activities. Studies for&#13;
the port rehabilitation, coastal and river transport, RTA, SLRA organization and management, and&#13;
Freetown traffic management have been completed. Detail designs and bidding documents have&#13;
been prepared for a number of components, including the office facilities of RTA, slipway repair at&#13;
the port and airport fencing. The detailed designs and bidding documents of a number of major&#13;
project components are under preparation. Local consultants have been selected by SLRA to pre-&#13;
pare the designs and bidding documents for the periodic maintenance road works component.&#13;
2.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.19   The Transport Sector Program and proposed TSP will be implemented by MTCE, SLRA,&#13;
SLPA, and SLAA. MTCE will monitor the implementation of the project through its CMIU, which&#13;
will be strengthened under the project. The CMUJ will be responsible for: (i) coordinating, inte-&#13;
grating into a consistent framework for monitoring the transport sub-sector planning prepared by&#13;
the sector agencies and authorities, and (ii) monitoring the economic, financial, social and envi-&#13;
ronmental performance in the sector. It will be staffed with national professionals (including&#13;
a transport economist, a project accountant/financial analyst, a statistician/database analyst, an&#13;
environmental coordinator and support staff), and the former Planning Unit will be dissolved.&#13;
Agreement has been obtained that MTCE will retain this contract-employed advisory group for a&#13;
period of three years and will propose ways and means to sustain this coordinating and monitonng&#13;
capacity for review with IDA during the mid-term project review. SLRA will be responsible for&#13;
implementing: (a) the road component, (b) the traffic management component; and (c) on behalf of&#13;
MTCE on an agency basis: (i) the coastal and river transport component, and (ii) the construction&#13;
and establishment of the office facilities of RTA. SLPA and SLAA will implement the respective&#13;
port and airport rehabilitation components. MTCE and SLRA have signed the agreements under&#13;
which SLRA will provide management services for the implementation of part (c) above on a fee&#13;
basis. These services will be financed under the existing PPF (para. 4.18) and the proposed credit.&#13;
4.20   RTA would consolidate the existing functions of road transport regulation and the collec-&#13;
tion of vehicle registration and license fees for the Road Fund. Its operating budgets will be met&#13;
from a portion of the fees that it collects for the Road Fund. Draft legislation is currently being&#13;
prepared for the establishment of RTA. MTCE has prepared an implementation schedule for&#13;
RTA, which is to be established and be fully operational by January 1, 1997; this schedule was&#13;
reviewed and agreed with IDA dunng negotiations. Agreement has been obtained that RTA legis-&#13;
lation will be enacted prior to credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.21   SLRA will implement the coastal and river transport component and the establishment of&#13;
RTA through its existing Project Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU). The PMCU of&#13;
SLRA was initially set up in mid- 1993 under the FIRP, and is currently responsible for implement-&#13;
ing, on behalf of the Freetown City Council, this project as well as the low-cost sanitation compo-&#13;
nent of the UWSP. SLRA will implement the rehabilitation and provision of landings at selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
sites using a stakeholder/community participatory approach, to involve the stakeholders in the&#13;
construction of these sites.&#13;
4.22    During project implementation, systematic user and stakeholder consultation and donor&#13;
coordination will continue to be sought through regular meetings and workshops and through rep-&#13;
resentation of users on the Boards of the authorities. Progress of implementation will be monitored&#13;
by the implementing authorities and the CMU against appropriate performance indicators which&#13;
were agreed during negotiations. Agreement has been also reached that the Government will organ-&#13;
ize, by December I of each year, joint annual reviews attended by donors, implementing agencies&#13;
and representatives of user groups to review progress and the proposed investments and recurrent&#13;
expenditures of the implementing agencies for the following year. A mid-term review of the project&#13;
will be held by December 1, 1998, to assess overall progress and to determine whether any adjust-&#13;
ments are required.&#13;
3.       Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.23    The project implementation schedule for the various components is shown in Annex 4-4.&#13;
The rehabilitation of the port and airport infrastructure, the construction of the RTA office facility&#13;
and the various institutional building components, are expected to be substantially completed&#13;
within 24 months of credit effectiveness. The proposed project would be completed by December&#13;
31, 2000.&#13;
4.      Procurement&#13;
4.24    The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.4 below and shown in detail in&#13;
Annex 4-5. All procurement of goods and works to be financed by IDA would be in accordance&#13;
with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD and IDA credits (January 1995).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
4.25   Procurement for all civil works contracts above US$1.0 million would be carried out under&#13;
Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Five such contracts valued at about&#13;
US$18.1 million would be awarded. Civil works valued at less than US$1 mnillion per contract&#13;
would be procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. NCB procedures will&#13;
include national advertising, public bid opening, clearly stated evaluation criteria, award to the&#13;
lowest evaluated bidder, and non-exclusion of foreign bidders if they wish to participate, which are&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Four such contracts for building works valued at about US$1.8 million in to-&#13;
tal, and about five contracts for piers and storage buildings worth a total of US$2.1 mnillion would&#13;
be awarded. About eleven contracts valued at about US$5.1 million in total would be awarded for&#13;
periodic maintenance of roads. These works are scattered throughout the country and are spread&#13;
out over a penod of two years. Contracts for feeder roads rehabilitation would be awarded to na-&#13;
tional contractors meeting qualification cnteria and including those who have been trained under&#13;
the AASP LDA supported project (para. 3.12) and have demonstrated their capacity to bid for&#13;
small contracts estimated at about US$100,000 each, not to exceed US$2.6 rnillion in aggregate.&#13;
The first NCB document for each of the three types of works will be reviewed by the Bank before&#13;
it is released to Bidders. Contracts for goods valued at more than US$200,000 each would be&#13;
awarded under ICB. Contracts for goods that are available locally and valued less than&#13;
US$200,000 each and not more than US$0.3 million in aggregate would be awarded under NCB&#13;
procedures. Other miscellaneous goods, such as office equipment, vehicles, etc., estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$50,000 per contract and not more than US$0.3 million in aggregate would be pro-&#13;
cured through national shopping procedures with the evaluations of price quotations from at least&#13;
three suppliers. FDA guidelines (August 1981) will be used for procurement of consulting services.&#13;
TIhe proposed credit would finance about US$3.9 million of consultant services including&#13;
US$2.7 million for studies and construction supervision and US$1.2 million of technical assis-&#13;
tance, and US$1.6 million of training activities.&#13;
4.26   Review. Bank-financed civil works contracts above a threshold of US$200,000 and goods&#13;
contracts above a threshold of US$50,000 will be subject to Bank prior review. The review proc-&#13;
ess will cover more than 90% of contracts by value. Smaller contracts would be subject to post&#13;
review. Bidding documents will be based on the latest Bank's Standard Bidding Document for&#13;
Small Works, Goods, and consultant procurement on the Bank's standard Letter of Invitation&#13;
package/Standard Contract Form. Prior IDA review of the consultant invitation package would be&#13;
required for all contracts over US$100,000 in value for consulting firms and US$10,000 for indi-&#13;
vidual consultants. Procurement standard times have been agreed with Government and beneficiar-&#13;
ies during negotiations. All implementing agencies are equipped to plan, manage and monitor pro-&#13;
curement activities. The General Procurement Notice for the Project has been issued for publica-&#13;
tion in the Development Business.&#13;
5.     Disbursement&#13;

4.28   The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit is shown in Annex 4-6.&#13;
It is faster than the profile for Bank/IDA financed transport projects in Africa, which reflects the&#13;
advanced preparation and actions taken to expedite procurement in anticipation of the IDA credit&#13;
as well as the implementation arrangements that have been put in place. The closing date of the&#13;
proposed credit would be June 30, 2001.&#13;
4.29   Two special accounts, MTCE and SLRA, covering four months of eligible expenditures&#13;
not likely to be the object of direct withdrawal application will be established at commercial banks&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The MTCE special accounts will cover expenditures by MTCE, SLAA and&#13;
SLPA. The authorized allocation for the special accounts will be: for MTCE: US$0.6 million;&#13;
SLRA: US$1.0 million. Upon effectiveness of the credit, 50% of the initial deposits will be made&#13;
available to each special account, and the remaining balance when cumulative disbursement and&#13;
outstanding commitments reach US$10 million. Replenishments of the special accounts should be&#13;
made on a monthly basis. Disbursement request will be fully documented except for expenditures&#13;
under contracts value of (i) less than US$200,000 equivalent for civil works, (ii) less than&#13;
US$50,000 for goods; and (iii) for services, less than US$100,000 for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$10,000 equivalent for individual consultants and all training expenditures, which may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). All credit beneficiaries will maintain&#13;
all supporting documents in their respective offices for review by visiting IDA supervision missions&#13;
and the extemal auditors.&#13;
6.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.30   Each implementation agency, MTCE, SLRA, SLPA and SLAA will account for its own&#13;
expenditures and will maintain project and special accounts as well as statements of expenditures.&#13;
MTCE/CMU will be responsible for the maintenance of accounts and records to reflect, in accor-&#13;
dance with Intemational Accounting Standards, the financial situation of the project and of its&#13;
sources and applications of funds. These will be supported by and reconciled with project ac-&#13;
counts maintained by each implementing agency. They will include management accounts to re-&#13;
flect the financial performance of each component of the project and to permit timely and reliable&#13;
monitoring of project funding availability. Each implementing agency will also maintain accounts&#13;
and records in accordance with Intemational Accounting Standards and produce annual financial&#13;
statements therefrom in a form suitable for audit. These accounts will allow the easy identification&#13;
of expenditures and assets under the project. A qualified accounting firm will assist in designing&#13;
and installing the project accounting system for CMU under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Agreement has been obtained that (i) the project accounting system of CMU will be operational&#13;
prior to credit effectiveness; (ii) the project accounts, together with the special account and state-&#13;
ment of expenditures, will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and (iii) MTCE&#13;
will submit the audited accounts, together with the auditors' management letter, to IDA not later&#13;
than six months after the close of the fiscal year. Agreement has also been obtained that the ac-&#13;
counts of each implementing agency will be audited annually by qualified independent auditors ac-&#13;
ceptable to IDA, and that the audited accounts and the auditor's reports will be submitted to IDA&#13;
not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
7.    Project Monitoring, Reporting and Supervision&#13;
4.31   A monitoring and information system will be developed and maintained at the CMU to&#13;
monitor key performance indicators against pre-established input and outcome indicators. Agree-&#13;
ment has been reached on the time-bound performance monitoring indicators shown in Annex 4-7.&#13;
Agreement has been reached that the Government will: prepare a Project Implementation Manual&#13;
before credit effectiveness; and organize a project launch workshop soon after the credit becomes&#13;
effective but not later than December 1, 1996; and hold annual reviews by December 1 of each&#13;
year and mnid-term review by December 1, 1998, with the participation of all implementing agen-&#13;
cies and donors. Representatives of beneficiaries, including NGOs, will be invited to attend.&#13;
During the course of implementation, the project will be supervised by Bank staff in accordance&#13;
with the supervision plan shown in Annex 4-7. At the annual implementation review, the progress&#13;
of the program will be evaluated and the expenditures program and financing plan for the following&#13;
year, as well as the updated Transport Sector Policy paper, will be reviewed. The mid-term review&#13;
will be jointly carried out with the Government, MTCE, SLRA, SLAA and SLPA. Corrective&#13;
measures may be proposed as a result of this review including necessary modifications in the scope&#13;
of the proposed project. A completion report will be prepared in accordance with Bank guidelines&#13;
by the Government (MTCE), with assistance of the implementing agencies, within six months of&#13;
the final disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
4.32   SIRA, SLPA, SLAA and RTA will prepare quarterly progress reports in standardized&#13;
formats which will have to be submitted to MTCE not later than one month after the end of each&#13;
quarter. MTCE will collate these reports into one project progress report and will include all ac-&#13;
tivities executed directly by the Ministry. These reports will include: (i) progress achieved against&#13;
agreed implementation and disbursement schedules and key performance indicators during the&#13;
previous quarter and since the beginning of the project, (ii) work programs for the coming quarter;&#13;
and (iii) financial statements from project and special accounts. At the end of the fiscal year the&#13;
report will be an annual report and should contain achievements during the previous year as well as&#13;
plans for the coming year.&#13;
5.   THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
5.1    As mentioned in para. 4.19, the proposed project would be implemented by MTCE,&#13;
SLRA, SLAA, and SLPA. Furthermore, parts of the proceeds of the proposed [DA credit would&#13;
be passed on to MTCE and SLRA as grants for the implementation of their respective project&#13;
components. The remainder would be onlent to SLAA and SLPA for the implementation of their&#13;
respective components, i.e. the rehabilitation of the airport and port facilities and the strengthen-&#13;
ing/restructunrng of their operations. The organization and management, and finances of SLRA,&#13;
SLAA and SLPA are discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
A.    SIERRA LEONE RoADs AUTHORITY&#13;
5.2    Organization and Management. SLRA was established under legislation enacted in Feb-&#13;
ruary 1992 as a semi-autonomous ent!ty responsible for the administrative control, planning, de-&#13;
velopment and maintenance of all roads in the countrv. It has the authority to hire and fire staff, fix&#13;
salary levels higher than Govemment pay scales, sign and award contracts, receive the bulk of its&#13;
funds for road maintenance from the Road Fund as allowed by Parliament and to levy other road&#13;
user charges subject to approval of Parliament. As shown in its organizational structure in An-&#13;
nex 5-1, it is managed by a Director General under the direction of a Board of Directors appointed&#13;
by the President. The Board has strong representation from the pnvate sector/organizations of&#13;
road users. It reports administratively to MWTM and is subject to extemal audit by independent&#13;
auditors. SLRA became operational in early 1993, with technical assistance from UNDP, EU and&#13;
IDA. SLRA currently has 640 employees. The accounts of SLRA have been audited by auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank every six months as required by its charter. These audits are unqualified.&#13;
5.3    Although SLRA has proven to be one of the best performing public entities in Sierra Le-&#13;
one, its Board of Directors and management, with donors' support, carried out a review study of its&#13;
organization in 1995. Based on the recommendations of this study, SLRA will improve its organ-&#13;
izational structure to cater for emerging needs, including the creation of a Finance Department and&#13;
the restructuring of its Equipment Department. SLRA has communicated to the Bank an action&#13;
plan for the improvement of its organization structure. Agreement has been obtained that SLRA&#13;
will implement the organizational improvements in accordance with an action plan which was&#13;
agreed dunng negotiations. Agreement has also been obtained that SLRA will: privatize routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance in accordance with a progressive schedule agreed with IDA; maintain the&#13;
terms and conditions for rental of plant pool equipment on commercial basis; complete the study&#13;
for the second phase of the restructuring of its Equipment Department by August 1, 1997, and im-&#13;
plement the recommendations, as mutually agreed with IDA, by July 1, 1998. Agreement has also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
been obtained that responsibilities of SLRA relative to the public road network will be stipulated in&#13;
the amendment to the SLRA Act. The agreed progressive schedule to privatize routine and peri-&#13;
odic maintenance is reflected in the agreed project performance indicators shown in Annex 4-7.&#13;
5.4    As mentioned in para. 4.21, a PMCU was established under the ongoing IDA-financed&#13;
FRP (Credit 2511 -SL) to assist the Director General of SLRA in implementing this project. The&#13;
PMCU will implement the RTA and coastal and river transport components of the proposed proj-&#13;
ect. SLRA has appointed an engineer to assist its PMCU in implementing these project compo-&#13;
nents.&#13;
5.5    Road Fund. As mentioned in paras. 2.18 to 2.20, the Road Fund was initially set up in&#13;
1989 by a cabinet decision to finance road maintenance work nationwide through user contribution.&#13;
It was subsequently incorporated in the SLRA Act of 1992, which stipulated the creation of this&#13;
Road Fund for the collection of: (a) road user charges levy on fuel; (b) vehicle licensing fees;&#13;
(c) vehicle registration fees; and (d) any other road user charges that may from time to time be al-&#13;
located to the fund by law, toll charges, for instance. The proceeds from this fund are intended&#13;
specifically to defray expenses for routine, periodic and emergency road maintenance.&#13;
5.6    Despite its legal stipulations, funding of the Road Fund has been secured exclusively by&#13;
levies charged on motor gasoline and diesel. Consequently, the Fund has had to face severe finan-&#13;
cial difficulties to meet with routine and maintenance demand of road network in Sierra Leone. For&#13;
this reason, the fuel levy has been raised several times for the past few years; in 1991, the levy was&#13;
26 Le/Ig (or 0.01 US$/liter). It has been raised to 100 Le/Ig (or 0.04 US$Aiter) in July 1992, and&#13;
to 200 Le/Ig (or 0.07 US$/liter) in December 1994, which was close to the long-term level esti-&#13;
mated necessary to ensure funding of routine and periodic maintenance. The sharp depreciation of&#13;
the Leone has reduced the already low fuei 'evy in.real Lerms and it is currently equivalent to&#13;
0.05 US$/liter, which makes it impossible for the Road Fund to cover the planned routine and&#13;
maintenance costs. In the meantime, the Government has regulated the pnrce of petrol and raised it&#13;
by 100% to 900 Le/Ig (0.40 US$/liter) in 1991, 1,375 Le/Ig (0.53 US$Aiter) in 1993, 1,650 Le/Ig&#13;
(0.57 US$/liter) in 1994, and 1,950 Le/Ig (0.45 US$Aliter at current price) in 1995.&#13;
5.7    The current structure of the Board of the Road Fund reflects well-balanced interests of&#13;
vanous stakeholders, including the Chairperson, the Director General of SLRA, a representative of&#13;
MWTM, a representative of Sierra Leone Motor Drivers Association, a representative of Sierra&#13;
Leone Institute of Engineers, a representative of Sierra Leone Chamber of Commerce, Industry and&#13;
Agriculture, two provincial representatives and a representative of Ministry of Finance. In accor-&#13;
dance with Article 13 of the SLRA Act, the Directors remain in office for a term of three years&#13;
which expired in October 1995. This term has been extended until a new Board is constituted.&#13;
The Road Fund has been audited by independent auditor every six months. These audits have been&#13;
submitted to IDA and are unqualified.&#13;
5.8    At present, the sole source of revenue for the Road Fund is the fuel levy. Taxes and user&#13;
fees, as summarized below, currently remain with the collecting agencies or go into general con-&#13;
solidated account. In general , the collection system for user fees, except for the fuel levy, is not&#13;
cost effective and inadequate - a mere US$0.3 million was collected in 1995.&#13;

5.9    Assuming that the current structure of fuel levy and user fees remain unchanged, the Road&#13;
Fund will be able to cover merely 35-76% of the planned maintenance program for the years 1996&#13;
to 2005. Although the rate of coverage could be improved through (a) cutting back the planned&#13;
periodic and routine maintenance program, (b) achieving cost savings through greater operational&#13;
efficiency, and (c) enforcing stricter rules on axle load control in order to minimize damage to the&#13;
road, they are not substantial solutions to the existing problems. A more efficient and rationalized&#13;
revenue collection system will be implemented under the proposed project to establish the sustain-&#13;
able road maintenance in the country.&#13;
5.10    Financial Covenants. A Task Force, composed of MTCE, SLRA and 1DA, has proposed&#13;
a new user fee system that would comprise the following elements: (a) all user fees, currently col-&#13;
lected by RTD and Police, will be collected by the newly established RTA and deposited directly&#13;
into the Road Fund; in addition, the current user fee structure will be rationalized and simplified to&#13;
make collection more efficient, (b) the current fuel levy will be raised to US$0.08 per liter equiva-&#13;
lent; (c) an additional fuel levy of US$0.02 liter equivalent will be effected for financing the main-&#13;
tenance of local roads and streets; (d) commercial authorization fee will be abolished and will be&#13;
merged with license fee; (e) license fee will be raised in steps reflecting the principle of cost recov-&#13;
ery based on relative damaging effect on road infrastructure by the various types of vehicles,&#13;
(f) registration fee will be raised; (g) driver's license fee will be raised; and (h) vehicle examination&#13;
will be conducted and fee will be collected by private garages authorized by RTA, a small percent-&#13;
age of which will be remitted to RTA. The current and proposed fee structure is shown in An-&#13;
nex 5-2. An understanding has been reached with the Government on a time-bound Road Fund&#13;
revenue raising schedule. Agreement has been reached that the Government will raise the road&#13;
maintenance charge (fuel levy) to US$0.08 per liter equivaient before credit effectiveness. Agree-&#13;
ment has also been reached that SLRA's accounts will be audited annually and will be submitted to&#13;
IDA, together with a management letter, within six months after the close of the year, and such&#13;
accounts and audits will also include the project accounts, the special account and statements of&#13;
expenditures, as well as technical audits based on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
5.11   SLRA's projected revenues and expenditures under the agreed fee increase schedule are&#13;
shown in Annex 5-3. Annual expenditures are to equal revenues. Out of the US$0.08 per liter&#13;
equivalent fuel levy, US$0.07 per liter equivalent would be used for financing maintenance of the&#13;
national road network; the remaining US$0.01 per liter equivalent for rural and local roads.&#13;
RTA's operating costs estimated at about US$230,000/year would also be financed from the Road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Fund. The Road Fund would cover close to 90% of the routine and periodic maintenance in the&#13;
planned Five-Year Program for the national road system (Annex 4-2). The only sizable shortfall is&#13;
expected in 1997 because of the phasing in of the revenue structure of the Road Fund.&#13;
B.    SIERRA LEONE AWRPORTS AUTHORrrY&#13;
5.12   Organization and Management. The SLAA was established as an independent, autono-&#13;
mous agency in July 1988. It is responsible for the management of the Freetown International Air-&#13;
port at Lungi and Hastings Airport. As shown in its organizational structure in Annex 5-4, SLAA&#13;
is supervised by a Board of Directors whose chairman is a former director of the Department of&#13;
Civil Aviation. The general manager and the members of the management team, all Sierra Le-&#13;
onean, have extensive management and professional experience. SLAA is considered to be an ef-&#13;
fectively managed institution. Its total work-force numbers 275 and most labor-intensive activities&#13;
are contracted out when necessary. It has the capacity to execute the air transport components of&#13;
the project. Its accounting system and auditing procedures, which are computerized and well-&#13;
maintained, are adequate to monitor day-to-day operations as well as long-term investment opera-&#13;
tions. The accounts have been audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank with a qualification on&#13;
the valuation of the assets taken over from the Department of Civil Aviation.&#13;
5.13   SLAA's Financial Performance. SLAA's past financial statements are highlighted in&#13;
Table 5.2 below and detailed in Annex 5-5. They have been restated in nominal prices in US Dol-&#13;
lars at the average exchange rate effective during each fiscal year.&#13;

5.14   SLAA eamed healthy net incomes over the period 1991 to 1993, with an average net profit&#13;
margin of 14.7%. However, as its net income declined markedlyto US$21,000 equivalent in 1994,&#13;
SLAA raised the landing and airport charges as well as other fees. As a result, its net income in-&#13;
creased to US$156,000 equivalent in 1995. SLAA's liquidity position has been tight; its cash bal-&#13;
ance of US$254,000 at the end of 1995 was equivalent to 1.7 months of its total cash operating&#13;
expenses. SLAA is free of long term debt. Accounts receivable declined from 118 days in 1993 to&#13;
100 days in 1995, while accounts payable were paid within 37 days on average. Tighter internal&#13;
controls should improve the situation.&#13;
5.15   Financial Projecfions. Summaries of SLAA's projected financial statemanets for the years&#13;
1996-2005 are highlighted in Table 5.3 below and detailed in Annex 5-5. The assumptions for the&#13;
projections are also detailed in Annex 5-5.&#13;

5.16    Airport revenues are highly sensitive to the country's macroeconomic and political envi-&#13;
ronment, and the current situation cautions for a worst case-type scenario on traffic projections;&#13;
accordingly, the traffic growth projections are conservative. Under these conservative assumptions&#13;
for traffic growth, the financial projections for the years 1996 to 2005 indicate that SLAA's fi-&#13;
nancial performance would be satisfactory. It would maintain, during this period, net profit mar-&#13;
gins ranging from 8.3% to 12.2%. Its liquidity position will continue to be tight through 1997, but&#13;
will improve thereafter. The debt-equity ratio would increase to 0.74 in 1998, but would decline&#13;
gradually thereafter as SLAA begins to service the outstanding long term loans. SLAA's debt&#13;
service coverage would exceed 3.1.&#13;
5.17    Financial Covenants. Agreements h2ve been reached with SLAA that it will: (i) submnit&#13;
to IDA, not later than six months after the close of the fiscal year, its annual audited accounts, to-&#13;
gether with the auditor's management letter, and the audit of the project accounts and statements&#13;
of expenditure, (ii) generate sufficient revenues to meet its operating expenses including deprecia-&#13;
tion, and debt service; (iii) maintain a mrinimum debt service coverage of 1.5; and (iv) not carry out&#13;
any investment(s), other than those included in the Project, larger than US$1 million equivalent,&#13;
without prior consultation with IDA.&#13;
C.      SIERRA LEONE PORTS AuTHoRrry&#13;
5.18    Organization and Management. The organization of the SLPA, as shown in Annex 5-6,&#13;
reflects the multiplicity of tasks performed on force account by the agency (marine services, regula-&#13;
tory duties, handling and storage, infrastructure, superstructure and equipment maintenance, se-&#13;
curity, ferry services, and slipway and marine workshop). Operations are highly centralized and&#13;
communication is inadequate. Since there is no involvement of the private sector, all investment or&#13;
financial risks fall on the SLPA. The port structure should be modified so that the SLPA concen-&#13;
trates on the duties which it is in a better position to perform. This can be done by either (i) licens-&#13;
ing of operators for commercial activities, in accordance with the 1964 Ports Act; or, better, (ii) by&#13;
transforming the SLPA in a holding corporation, which would perform the core duties of a public&#13;
port authority, and be a minority shareholder of profitable, licensed private or/and mixed compa-&#13;
nies operating commercial and industrial activities. Cargo handling, storage, the slipway, and the&#13;
marine workshop are obvious candidates for licensing to private operators or for privatization.&#13;
Restructuring and re-staffing is necessary for improving the cargo-handling performance. Agree-&#13;
ment has been reached that (i) SLPA shall assist MTCE in carrying out the study for the restruc-&#13;
turing of SLPA, including a management and financial review; (ii) a time-bound restructuring ac-&#13;
tion plan will be submitted to IDA by March 1, 1997; and (iii) SLPA will thereafter implement the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
action plan as agreed with IDA. Outline terms of reference for the restructuring study by inde-&#13;
pendent consultants have been finalized. The study's findings and recommendations will be re-&#13;
viewed in consultation with IDA. The accounts of SLPA have been audited by auditors acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. The audits are unqualified.&#13;
5.19   SLPA has been operated by a port management consulting firm under a managernent con-&#13;
tract since 1987. The management contract, financed from the port's own resources, was extended&#13;
for one year and for a reduced foreign expert team, starting from April 30, 1996. The currertly&#13;
employed consultants have been managing day-to-day operations and have organized training for&#13;
the counterparts, in Freetown, Ghana and Europe. Results of the management contract have been&#13;
disappointing in policy formulation, definition of strategies, accounting and management systems,&#13;
and, particularly, the transfer of management responsibilities to nationals. The performance of&#13;
individual consultants or firms freely sub-contracted by the present consultants has not been satis-&#13;
factory in all cases. A new management plan, for the transfer of management to nationals, was&#13;
agreed to during negotiations and the implementation of this plan will be a condition of credit dis-&#13;
bursement against the physical components for the port rehabilitation and slipway repair. SLPA&#13;
will prepare and submit by September 1, 1996 a program for back-up support to ensure that the&#13;
Sierra Leonean managemnent team will manage port operations effectively. Government policy and&#13;
practices regarding the SLPA are also a cause for difficulties either because all management deci-&#13;
sion are de facto to be approved a posterioni by Government, or because Government agencies do&#13;
not pay their bills to SLPA, even when they have the budget for it. This jeopardizes the port's cash&#13;
flow; on the side of the debtor agencies, drawing on the port is equivalent to obtaining additional&#13;
budget allowances, which is not for good financial discipline. Measures to rectify the situation will&#13;
be spelled out in the Ferry Services Agreement (see para. 5.21).&#13;
5.20   After its creation in 1965, SLPA' staffing had grown and reached 2,064 employees.&#13;
Through continuing attrition, it is currently 1,740; staff is in excessive number, overage, and un-&#13;
derqualified; qualifications are low but many staff cannot be retrained due to lack of basic educa-&#13;
tion. SLPA needs fewer, younger, and more skilled workers. The average age of SLPA employees&#13;
is 45. In Operations and Stevedoring, the average age is more than 50 and is one of the causes for&#13;
low productivity in cargo-handling. A voluntary retirement scheme will be added to the present&#13;
retirement plan and a system of extended special leave will be implemented. This cannot be done&#13;
before the restructuring has been decided upon. The present attrition program is based on a 1994&#13;
Manpower Study which estimated staffing needs at 1,250 employees. The staffing aspect will be&#13;
reviewed as part of the restructuring study&#13;
5.21   Ferry services. The Government has handed over the care of ferry services to SLPA&#13;
without a written mandate, concession, or other agreement, which would stipulate the respective&#13;
rights and duties of both parties to the agreement. The ferry service is a drain on SLPA's finances.&#13;
Accumulated ferry losses from 1990 to 1995 are estimated at Le 6.7 billion, wiping out 67% of&#13;
SLPA's surplus over the period; in addition SLPA paid the equivalent of some US$1.5 million to&#13;
repay hard currency loans contracted by Government for the purchase of a ferry. The ferry service&#13;
absorbs a large part of the time and energy of SLPA's General Manager. Agreement has been&#13;
reached that national consultancy services will prepare a draft agreement between the Govenmuent&#13;
and SLPA, acceptable to IDA, for the management and operation of the Freetown-Tagrin ferry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
services (Ferry Services Agreement). This agreement will also define respective obligations and&#13;
rights of Government and SLPA as may be required (para. 5.19). Execution of this agreement will&#13;
be a condition of disbursement against expenditures related to the physical components of the port&#13;
rehabilitation and slipway repair (para. 4.11).&#13;
5.22    SLPA's Financial Performance. Summaries of SLPA's past financial statements are&#13;
highlighted in Table 5.4 below and detailed in Annex 5-7. These financial statements have been&#13;
restated in nomninal prices in US dollars at the average exchange rate effective during each fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;

5.23    Due to a significant decline in traffic resulting from the deteriorated security situation in&#13;
the country in recent years, SLPA's revenues decreased from US$15.2 million equivalent in 1991&#13;
to about US$11.0 million equivalent in 1995. As a result, SLPA's net income declined markedly,&#13;
from US$3.3 million equivalent in 1991 to US$156,000 equivalent in 1994 and a loss of&#13;
US$59,000 equivalent in 1995. The net profit margin declined steadily from an average of 26% in&#13;
1991-1992 to below 2% in 1994 and -0.5% in 1995. Most of the recent traffic consisted of food-&#13;
aid shipments whose handling was unpaid. An examination of the port's financial statements re-&#13;
veals that all departments are profitable, with the exception of the ferry services, which has consis-&#13;
tently incurred a loss. SLPA's subsidy of ferry services from its port operations will be addressed&#13;
in the Ferry Services Agreement to be executed beween SLPA and the Government (para. 5.21).&#13;
As part of the port restructuring (para. 5.18), the port will institute an overhaul of its accounting&#13;
controls system and control operating expenses. As traffic volume increases, the port's revenues&#13;
will increase, boosting net income. In addition, the expiration of the management contract, which&#13;
includes expatriates, will significantly reduce SLPA's operating expenses, as it is paid out of the&#13;
port's revenues and is equivalent to the entire payroll of the port. SLPA currently has no long-term&#13;
debt.&#13;
5.24    Financial Projections. SLPA's projected financial staternents are highlighted in Table 5.5&#13;
below and detailed in Annex 5-7. The assumptions for the projections are also detailed in An-&#13;

5.25   Projections for traffic growth are conservative, as the growth rate will be affected by the&#13;
new political situation. The financial projections for the period 1996 to 2005 indicate that, on the&#13;
basis of historical values of the assets and current tariff structure, SLPA's net income would rise to&#13;
US$1.2 million in the years 1998-2000, and would decline from the year 2001 as it begins to&#13;
charge interests on long term debts to operations. Similarly, its net profit margin would rise to&#13;
8.5% in the year 2000, and decline steadily after 2001. The financial projections indicate that&#13;
SLPA would maintain a healthy cash balance. While the debt-equity ratio increases as SLPA&#13;
takes on debt to finance its investment program, it would remain at an acceptable level. Debt&#13;
service coverage ratio would be at least 1.9 during the projected period.&#13;
5.26   Financial Covenants. Agreements have been reached with SLPA that it will: (i) submit&#13;
to IDA, not later than six months after the close of the fiscal year, its annual audited accounts, to-&#13;
gether with the auditor's management letter, and the audits of the project accounts, and statements&#13;
of expenditure; (ii) generate sufficient revenues to meet its operating expenses including deprecia-&#13;
tion, and debt service; (iii) maintain a minimum debt service coverage of 1.5; and (iv) not carry out&#13;
any investment(s), other than those included in the Project, larger than US$2 million equivalent,&#13;
without prior consultation with IDA.&#13;
6.    BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    GENERAL&#13;
6.1    This chapter discusses the economic and social benefits, poverty alleviation and environ-&#13;
mental impacts, and the risks associated with the project and the program. The project will have&#13;
important but unmeasurable benefits as well as several direct, tangible and measurable benefits&#13;
describe below.&#13;
B.    BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC RETURNS&#13;
6.2    The project's direct, tangible but unmeasurable benefits are as follows:&#13;
*   improved, transparent sector management, including more effective management and&#13;
monitoring of sector parastatals and their operations on a commercial basis;&#13;
*   increased direct private sector participation in road maintenance, waterway transpor-&#13;
tation, port and airline operations, and vehicle examination; and indirect private sec-&#13;
tor participation through user representation on the boards of transport parastatals;&#13;
*   through a steady volume of road maintenance works, expanded capacity of small and&#13;
medium construction enterprises and of local consultants in project preparation, im-&#13;
plementation, auditing and supervision;&#13;
*   training of skilled and unskilled labor, which can move to other construction activi-&#13;
ties;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
*   savings in travel time by households to jobs, schools, markets and health facilities in&#13;
urban and poor peri-urban areas as well as rural areas;&#13;
*   improved airport safety through compliance with the ICAO security regulations for&#13;
the airport, and&#13;
*   support to the Transport Sector Policy consistent with overall macro-economic ob-&#13;
jectives, in particular Sierra Leone's competitiveness in local and regional markets,&#13;
and poverty alleviation.&#13;
6.3    The project's direct, measurable benefits are based on quantifiable benefits arising mainly&#13;
from user cost savings. Economic internal rates of return (ERR) calculations and sensitivity&#13;
analysis are estimated in Annex 6-1 for the road infrastructure, road transport, port rehabilitation,&#13;
water transport and the air transport components, and summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Road Infrastructure Component: The cost-benefit analysis for the IDA-financed&#13;
portion of the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program was carried out us-&#13;
ing data on road and traffic collected by SLRA. Benefits were approximated by&#13;
savings in vehicle operating costs. The road component has an overall EIRR of&#13;
25% and NPV of US$8.0 million discounted at 12%, with all subcomponents&#13;
yielding EIRRs greater than 12%, except for a few sections classified as gravel&#13;
main roads. These sections are expected to yield higher EIiRRs if uncaptured&#13;
benefits to farmers are incorporated. The non [DA-financed portion of the pro-&#13;
gram is estimated to yield EfRRs between 12% to 40%. Sensitivity analyses indi-&#13;
cate that the overall EIRR of the road component would decrease to 22% if there&#13;
is a cost overrun of 10%, and to 17% if project implementation is delayed by one&#13;
year.&#13;
(b)    Road Transport Component: Economic retums were calculated for the IDA-&#13;
financed component of road transport. Benefits were quantified by saving in&#13;
transportation in terms of time and vehicle operation costs. The ERR is 25% and&#13;
NPV is $1.6 million, discounted at 12%. The result of the sensitivity analysis&#13;
shows that the base ERR decreases from 25% to 23 with a 10% cost-overrun and&#13;
to 21% with a one-year implementation delay.&#13;
(c)    Port Rehabilitation Component: The cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the&#13;
IDA-financed component of port rehabilitation, the paving of the unsurfaced areas&#13;
of the port and a program of deferred maintenance. Benefits were approximated&#13;
by savings in operation and maintenance costs. This component has an overall&#13;
EIRR of 24% and NPV of US$7.1 million discounted at 12%. This return would&#13;
be reduced to 22% if there is a cost-overrun of 10%, and to 20% if project imple-&#13;
mentation is delayed by one year.&#13;
(d)    Coastal and River Transport Component. Economic retums were calculated for a&#13;
sample of 12 out of 77 landings studied. Benefits were calculated from vessel,&#13;
passenger, handling and spoilage savings. Five typical landings in Phase I invest-&#13;
ment were analvzed. These calculations show ERRs ranging from 16% to 97%&#13;
for the selected locations. Sensitivity analyses against risks of 10% cost-overrun&#13;
and 10% decrease in benefits still supported the viability of these landings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(e)    Air Transport Component. Economic retums were calculated for the IDA-&#13;
financed component. Benefits were calculated savings in maintenance. NPV is&#13;
estimated as $0.7 million, discounted at 12%, and ERR is 19%. The sensitivity&#13;
analysis against the cost-overrun by 10% reduced the ERR to 17%, and the im-&#13;
plementation delay by one year reduced it to 16%.&#13;
C.    SOCIAL BENEFITS AND POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
6.4    The Transport Sector Investment Program and the IDA credit will deliver direct and indi-&#13;
rect benefits to the poor. Direct benefits will arise from:&#13;
(a)    improved access of remote rural areas, included areas isolated by the conflict, to&#13;
social services such as health and education;&#13;
(b)    easier access by farmers to inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, extension services&#13;
and even credit,&#13;
(c)    increased employment opportunities in rural areas through the promotion of labor-&#13;
based construction and maintenance of roads;&#13;
(d)    better access roads to low income areas in the main cities;&#13;
(e)    improved non-motorized and pedestrian facilities in urban areas - the former will&#13;
provide a lower cost alternative to public transport for goods as well as individuals&#13;
and the latter will improve safety, and&#13;
(f)   improved traffic flow and reduction of congestion in Freetown.&#13;
6.5   Indirect benefits will arise from the reduced cost of transporting goods and personnel on&#13;
improved roads. In some cases the possibility of marketing a production surplus will become fea-&#13;
sible for the first time, while in others, improved roads will result in lower transport cost through&#13;
increased competition and/or better prices through access to more lucrative markets. The program&#13;
will assist in creating employment both directly in transport civil works and indirectly through ex-&#13;
pansion of farming and other economic activities. Road safety improvements under the program&#13;
will help reduce the high rate of road accidents and fatalities, which affect the poor disproportion-&#13;
ately.&#13;
D.    ENVIRONMENTAL IMEPACT&#13;
6.6    The proposed project has been placed under environmental category B. The main envi-&#13;
rornental impacts of the proposed project are: (i) minor soil erosion caused by road rehabilitation&#13;
works; (ii) sand extraction on beaches for various construction works; (iii) increased vehicular&#13;
speed due to improved roads; (iv) increased emissions of air pollution due to the poor standard of&#13;
the vehicle fleet; (v) risk of an oil spill and waste disposal at the port; and (vi) negative impacts of&#13;
possible deepening, widening and change of river courses related to river transport improvements.&#13;
An environmental assessment was carried out for the proposed project and a specific study on the&#13;
port rehabilitation was prepared, a summary of which given in Annex 6-2. The final report con-&#13;
taining an environmental analysis and a mitigation plan addressing these impacts was presented to&#13;
IDA in June 1995 and the final draft of the port rehabilitation study was presented to IDA in Janu-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
ary 1996 (see Project File). Most of the above conditions would be improved with the project&#13;
through the implementation of the proposed mitigation plan.&#13;
6.7    The study recommends a mitigation plan which encompasses the following: (i) legal and&#13;
regulatory measures relating to: environmental guidelines and standards for road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance works; vehicle emission and noise; proper operational procedures and occupational&#13;
health and safety procedures in connection with road works, vehicle examination centers, port and&#13;
airport operation ; (ii) coordination of environmental activities to be carried out under the project&#13;
by an environmental coordinator working in the Environmental Department within the MCTE and&#13;
attached to the CMU; (iii) strengthening of the existing environmental unit at SLRA and introduc-&#13;
tion of a new road safety unit; and (iv) various technical measures to be incorporated in the design&#13;
of the physical components of the proposed project. The Environmental Department will coordi-&#13;
nate and implement the mitigation plan through an environmental coordinator in the CMU to be&#13;
appointed by MTCE (para. 4.19). The terms of reference for the environmental coordinator is in-&#13;
cluded in the Project Files. All future feasibility studies and design of public works under the pro-&#13;
posed project will incorporate the recommendations of the Environmental Impact Assessment and&#13;
Mitigation Plan.&#13;
E.    RISKS&#13;
6.8    The principal risks of the proposed project are political and related to the rebel war in the&#13;
country. Dissident groups of the armed forces had until recently rendered many areas of the coun-&#13;
try except the Freetown Peninsula and the Lungi Airport area unsafe for economic activities.&#13;
However, the expectation is that the recent inauguration of the newly elected democratic govem-&#13;
ment on March 29, 1996, a cease-fire in effect and on-going negotiations with the rebel movement,&#13;
will further contribute to the marked improvement in the security situation observed over the few&#13;
months prior to the cease-fire. Since many of the components of the proposed project (port, coastal&#13;
and river transport, airport, sector management and coordination, establishment of RTA) are lo-&#13;
cated in safe areas, a first phase of the proposed project could be implemented even under the&#13;
situation that existed before the cease-fire. However, if the rebel war recurs, it would make eco-&#13;
nomic growth unlikely and hence the justification for some of the planned investments question-&#13;
able. The political and security situation could also lead to delays in project implementation, in-&#13;
cluding the privatization of designated entities.&#13;
6.9    Other risks and the measures to be taken to mitigate them are.&#13;
(a)    benefits arising from roads improvement not sustained due to inadequate funding&#13;
of maintenance: agreement has been obtained during the negotiations that the&#13;
Government will raise the levy on vehicle fuel to US$0.08 per liter equivalent;&#13;
(b)   increase in cost and/or decrease in benefits arising from unforeseen factors: sensi-&#13;
tivity analyses on the economic retums of the various project components, shown&#13;
in para. 6.3, indicate adequate EIRRs;&#13;
(c)    non-availability of Govemment counterpart funds: the Government's creation of a&#13;
project account in SLRA's name with an initial deposit of LelOO million and its&#13;
quarterly deposits thereafter will diminish this risk, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
(d)    management performance may not be up to expectations: the monitoring system&#13;
installed at CMU and the monitoring indices developed for the project will allow&#13;
early detection of management shortcomings. Also, the planned improvements and&#13;
restructuring of project implementing agencies and the training program for their&#13;
staff will minimize this risk.&#13;

TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
LETTER OF TRANSPORT SEcrOR POLICY&#13;
SIERRA  LEONE GOVEBZNT&#13;
MC\655&#13;
24th April, 1996&#13;
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn&#13;
President&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C.&#13;
USA&#13;
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,&#13;
Re: Sierra Leone - Proposed Transport Sector Project - Letter of Sector Policies&#13;
Our Ministry has been working with your staff on the Transport Sector Project which is due to go&#13;
to the IDA Board in June 1996. In order to place this project in its proper policy context and in&#13;
advance of its presentation to the Board, we are writing to inform the Intemational Development&#13;
Association of the initiatives we are currently taking in the transport sector in Sierra Leone.&#13;
Govemment attaches high priority to the sector's role in increasing human welfare and economic&#13;
growth. This letter therefore highlights the main constraints facing the sector and the strategies&#13;
designed to address them. This policy and strategy framework will be used to underpin the design&#13;
and implementation of the proposed IDA-supported Transport Sector Project (TSP), as well as&#13;
other donor supported projects.&#13;
Backeround&#13;
The transport sector in Sierra Leone is currently characterized by inadequate infrastructure and&#13;
inefficient services; poor maintenance practices, an ineffective inland water transport system;&#13;
continued impediments by non-physical barriers such as inappropriate policies, excessive&#13;
regulation, and cumbersome procedures, all of which inhibit efficient traffic flow; inadequate and&#13;
undeveloped indigenous capabilities to plan, design, manage, and operate the sector; the absence of&#13;
reliable data for planning and application of modem management systems; and obsolete regulatory&#13;
rules which were inherited from the colonial period.&#13;
In view of the shortcomnings listed above, a fundamental transport policy reform is essential to&#13;
increase the role and operational significance of transport in the economnic development process. A&#13;
reformed and well - structure transport sector can help reduce the drain on public funds and raise&#13;
the level of savings by charging tariffs and rates that cover the cost of services, and by transferring&#13;
transport services to private enterprises, thereby releasing public funds for other uses. Similarly,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the sector could strike an optimal balance between construction, rehabilitation and maintenance,&#13;
ensuring that no investments are undertaken that do not have an acceptable economic rate of retum.&#13;
In addition, the sector could increase its own efficiency by improving the management o its human&#13;
resources and physical facilities, by promoting competition, and by increasing the use of the private&#13;
sector for maintenance and construction works. In this way, the transport sector could also&#13;
contribute some funds to supplement the Government's investment in the sector.&#13;
STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS&#13;
Transport Sector Coordination. Government is seeking to improve the operational efficiency,&#13;
service quality, and availability of transport services by implementing appropriate policies and&#13;
administrative measures that will increase their competitiveness, productivity, and profitability,&#13;
while at the same time ensuring social and economic development. In pursuit of the above, the&#13;
following lines of action are proposed:- strengthening of the Co-ordination and Monitoring Unit at&#13;
the Ministry of Transport Communications and the Environment in terms of trained manpower and&#13;
logistics support by the creation of an advisory unit (comprising of Transport Economist and a&#13;
graduate Data Analyst) financed from a percent levy on transport sector revenue and staffed with&#13;
Sierra Leonean professionals who are employed on contract and paid competitive salaries;&#13;
establishing standard reporting and audit formats for the various transport-related parastatals; the&#13;
issuance of a manual on the qualifications, code of conduct, and performance of Board Members of&#13;
these parastatals; reviewing the Transport Sector Policy periodically and monitoring its&#13;
implementation; and transport sector donor co-ordination.&#13;
Financin!flnvestment. In the short and medium term, govemment proposes to establish efficient&#13;
methods of resource mobilization to ensure sustainability of the project of rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of the transport sector; establish a Resource Mobilization Committee comprising the&#13;
Ministries of Transportation Communications and the EnWoronment; Finance; Development and&#13;
Economic Planning; Foreign Affairs; and Work and Technical Maintenance which will draw up&#13;
programmes and seek funding, locally and intemationally; introduce user fee charges for services;&#13;
and establish subsidy criteria. Transport services will also be improved through the promotion of&#13;
enterprises, the liberalization of services, and the creation of an enabling framework for&#13;
strengthening the private sector.&#13;
Manpower Development.   Govemment intends to promote human resources planning,&#13;
development, and utilization in order to improve the quality and availability of personnel at all&#13;
levels for efficient management and operation of transport modes. Along these lines the following&#13;
actions will be undertaken:- training of personnel in all transport fields, improvement of conditions&#13;
of service and career opportunities; provision of opportunities for national experts; establishment&#13;
and adequate funding of training institutions locally; provision of opportunities for specialized&#13;
training overseas; and, promotion of exchange programmes for local personnel.&#13;
Roads Infrastructure. The overall of the roads infrastructure policy is to rehabilitate and&#13;
maintain, in good condition, the existing road network nation-wide, in order to maximize its&#13;
contribution to the economic development programme. The objectives are to remove physical&#13;
bottflenecks in the road network in order to unleash a strong supply response in support of the&#13;
econonic recovery programme, through rehabilitation and maintenance; to build institutional&#13;
capacity to improve management and planning and to foster market-oriented policies, to strengthen&#13;
road infrastructure institutions by restructuring if necessary, to provide an independent source of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

funding through user fees, to encourage new methods of infrastructure rehabilitation, using&#13;
appropriate labour-intensive technologies and local resources and inputs, in order to generate jobs&#13;
and provide a sustainable maintenance system; to increase the role of the private sector in road&#13;
maintenance, and develop the capacity of small and medium-sized local contractors to perform&#13;
road maintenance.&#13;
The actions to be undertaken will include the implementation of phased and balanced programmes&#13;
of development and management of roads infrastructure, taking into account the needs and&#13;
requirements of the production and marketing centres, rehabilitation, upgrading, and maintenance&#13;
of the most critical elements of the existing roads infrastructure so as to improve their efficiency&#13;
and capacity utilization, as well as to prolong their economic life, and assessment of the adequacy&#13;
of the existing road network in terms of geographic distribution, integration with other modes, and&#13;
responsiveness to road transport demands.&#13;
In the area of user fee pricing and cost recovery, government will closely monitor fuel levy&#13;
revenues and examine the adequacy of the levy level; gradually adjust road user charges to fully&#13;
recover the costs of routine and penrodic maintenance; pay directly to the Road Fund all fees&#13;
collected by the Road Transport Authority (vehicles and drivers license fees, vehicle examination&#13;
and registration fees, and commercial authorization fees), examine other local sources of funding&#13;
and contributions in kind; develop local sources of funding for the construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
mostly maintenance of rural feeder roads in connection with local communities; and develop&#13;
cooperation with the Intemational Labou (rganization (1LO) and Non-Government Organizations&#13;
(NGOs).&#13;
To facilitate institutional strengthening, action will be taken to provide logistic support to SLRA in&#13;
the form of vehicles and improved office equipment and facilities, provide Technical Assistance to&#13;
SLRA at all levels of management, continue to develop tiie Road Infrastructure Management&#13;
Information System, and develop and implement better planning techniques to optimize the road&#13;
investment programme, taking into consideration network planning or optimization techniques and&#13;
economic rates of return on investment.&#13;
In the field of human resources development, the following programmes are planned: the&#13;
implementation of the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) human resources and&#13;
training programme, development of civil engineering, and other transport planning and&#13;
management curncula in Sierra Leone's institutions of leaming, and the formulation of training&#13;
programmes for private road maintenance contractors.&#13;
In an effort to facilitate private sector development, private road contractors will be encouraged&#13;
through the award of small road maintenance contractors, using labour-intensive technologies,&#13;
training programmes for contractors, and leasing of equipments to contractors.&#13;
Environmental protection and control will be ensured by the following measures: a review of&#13;
transport investment programmes to determine which road projects are likely to have a significant&#13;
impact on the environment: the commissioning of an environmental impact study in the design&#13;
phase for these projects, taking action to preserve arable lands, restrict deforestation, preserve&#13;
natural areas (classified forests, animal reserves and parks, tourist and archaeological sites);&#13;
undertaking reforestation, in conjunction with road infrastructure works, giving close attention to&#13;
air pollution in the cities, mostly Freetown, and creating and maintaining in SLRA an in-house&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Road Transport. The main goal of this subsector is to establish a road transport system that will&#13;
be available, safe, reliable, efficient, cost effective, sustainable, and capable of facilitating the&#13;
exploitation and evacuation of resources and the movement of persons within and between towns.&#13;
In order to reach these goals, Sierra Leone's policy in the Road Transport Subsector will focus on&#13;
the following objectives: the creation of an autonomous user financed Road Transport Authority&#13;
(RTA), responsible for developing and implementing the Road Transport Policy, specification of&#13;
vehicle standards, licensing of vehicles, licensing of drivers, and monitoring the Road Transport&#13;
Sector and its pricing policies; the establishment of a clear set of safety, energy and environmental&#13;
standards, licensing requirements for vehicles, drivers, transportation service, firms, traffic&#13;
regulations etc., the development of comprehensive and effective enforcement programmes through&#13;
clear schedules setting fines and penalties for violations of standards and traffic laws; the creation&#13;
of a special corps of traffic wardens and public information campaigns; encouragement and&#13;
promotion of the private sector in road transport related activities; the development of private&#13;
maintenance and inspection services, and contracting of maintenance services for government&#13;
vehicles; and the initiation of measures to privatize the Road Transport Corporation.&#13;
The plans of action envisaged include the creation of a Road Transport Authority (RTA), a review&#13;
of road transport legislation and the setting up of standards and regulations which will cover the&#13;
following areas: minimal standards for imported new and used automotive vehicles; standards for&#13;
imported automotive parts: standards for imported automotive fuels, safety, energy, and&#13;
environmental standards for automotive vehicles (private cars, taxis, vans, light lorries, heavy&#13;
lorries, buses), including standards for axle loads, trar-sportation of liquids and hazardous&#13;
materials; a programme for the certification of approved maintenance and repair facilities and&#13;
inspection stations; criteria for the certification of road transport carries, and traffic laws and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
A study is to be undertaking on the appropriate pricing of user fees for vehicle licenses and&#13;
registration, vehicle inspection fees, drivers licenses, business licenses for certified inspection&#13;
centres and maintenance shops set to fully cover the regulatory agency's expenses. In addition,&#13;
another study will be commissioned on the appropriate pricing, regulation, and guidelines for&#13;
transport services (taxis, intra-urban buses, inter-urban buses, road freight, etc.)&#13;
Private sector development will be encouraged through the privatization of the Road Transport&#13;
Corporation (within six months); the promotion of the development of certified private automotive&#13;
inspection centres to verify vehicle compliance with emission standards, mechanical fitness, etc.;&#13;
the development of a private competitive automotive insurance industry; the development, through&#13;
duty-free concessions, of private automotive maintenance, repair and rehabilitation shops and&#13;
stations; and the contracting of maintenance and repair of government vehicles to private facilities.&#13;
Maritime and Water Transport. The overall goal of the Maritime and Water Transport&#13;
Subsector is to develop and efficient, safe, reliable and competitive maritime, coastal and infland&#13;
waterways system in support of Sierra Leone's economic development programme. Based upon&#13;
the goals and objectives set for the maritime and water transport sector, the following action plan is&#13;
proposed: the setting up a semi-autonomous Maritime Services Agency (MSA) to coordinate and&#13;
regulate all maritime, coastal and niland transport activities, as compared to the existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45                                        Annex 3-1&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
arrangernents; the commissioning of a strategic planning study on the future of the Sierra Leone&#13;
Ports Authority (SLPA), involving the re-organization of SLPA into autonomous profit centres or&#13;
companies (maritime services, harbour operations, ship repair, ferry) and the feasibility of&#13;
privatizing some of the activities, such as cargo handling and ferry services; the privatization of the&#13;
Sierra Leone National Shipping Company (SLNSC); an investigation of the possibility of&#13;
converting the Port of Freetown into a free trade zone; and the possibility of developing the port of&#13;
Niti into a second National Port.&#13;
In the area of intemational maritime cooperation, the relevant intemational standards on safety and&#13;
the environment will be ratified and implemented; intemational cooperation with multilateral&#13;
agencies - UNCTAD, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Regional Maritime&#13;
Academy, and the Ports Management Association will be enhanced; and regional cooperation&#13;
(through MINCOMAR), will be strengthened.&#13;
Air Trasport Policy. The main thrust of the air transport sector is on the provision of an&#13;
adequate, safe, secure, reliable, efficient, affordable and sustainable air transport service, in&#13;
support of the country's programme of economic and social development. The achievement of the&#13;
above will facilitate the development of Sierra Leone's intemational trade; contribute to improving&#13;
the business climate by facilitating the movement of national and intemational business executives;&#13;
facilitate the development of intemational tourism in Sierra Leone and promote tourism, especially&#13;
in areas like the Gola Forest, Lake Sonfon, Outamba Kilimi Game Reserve, Bonthe, Kabala, etc.;&#13;
develop intemational technical cooperation in aviation; facilitate trade and economic integration&#13;
within the West Africa subregion; contribute to a better integration of the national economy; and&#13;
facilitate commerce, particularly the evacuation o huigh value precious minerals from the interior of&#13;
the country.&#13;
Under the proposed Transport Sector Project, govenmment will restructure and reorganize the&#13;
overall administration of the air transport subsector; create a semi-autonomous Civil Aviation Unit,&#13;
with funding from user fees; strengthen the Sierra Leone Airport Authoonty, as a semi-autonomous,&#13;
self sustained provider of airport infrastructure services, with funding from airport user fees;&#13;
investigate areas that can be run by the private sector; exploit intemational traffic rights and&#13;
improve intemational air service to Sierra Leone through inter-line agreements and joint-venture&#13;
agreements between Sierra Leone National Airlines and foreign airline partners; maintain Lungi&#13;
Inteational Airport to ICAO standards, maintain Hastings airport to acceptable standards; and&#13;
improve access from Freetown to Lungi Airport.&#13;
In order to achieve these objectives, government will implement the following lines of action:&#13;
commission a feasibility and cost/benefit analysis of restructuring the Directorate of Civil Aviation&#13;
and transform it into an autonomous Civil Aviation Agency financed with (a portion of) the&#13;
proceeds of fees generated from aviation; amend Civil Aviation Legislation to reflect the reform of&#13;
the Civil Aviation administration; review existing multi-lateral treaties and agreements (ICAO,&#13;
etc.); examine existing bilateral agreements on intemational traffic rights; negotiate bilateral&#13;
agreement with other countries to develop intemational scheduled traffic; develop a liberal policy&#13;
with respect to foreign charter airlines; and develop a liberal policy with respect to foreign freight.&#13;
Government will also assess the situation of other domestic regional airfields; commission a study&#13;
on the feasibility of redeveloping a schedule domestic air service; and, in conjunction with the local&#13;
communities and the private sector, rehabilitate provincial airfield; and develop policy with respect&#13;
to domestic air taxis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The Sierra Leone Airport Authority (SLAA) will perform an analysis of airport user fees structure;&#13;
develop and implement a multi-phase action plan and investment programme with priority on&#13;
security and safety; develop a Long-Term Master Plan for the country's international airports;&#13;
develop an integrated Airport Management Information System; develop an air terminal in&#13;
Freetown; and conduct and Institutional and Financial Review of the Sierra Leone Airports&#13;
Authority with a view to privatizing certain functions of the Authority.&#13;
Meteoroloey. The goal of this sector is to make available reliable weather and climatic data to&#13;
protect property and to assure citizens of their safety from natural hazards. Govemment proposes&#13;
to look into the possibility of restructuring the Meteorology Department in to a viable self-&#13;
financing entity, and to establish investment requirements to enable the Department to perform its&#13;
functions more efficiently.&#13;
Proiect Sustainability. This would be enhanced by the following measures: key stakeholders and&#13;
private sector involvement in management, monitoring and implementation; SLRA's commercial&#13;
orientation and capacity to program and contract out road maintenance works; maintaining full&#13;
cost recovery level of the fuel levy and other road user charges; enhanced local capacity and&#13;
stronger sector coordination and monitoring by MTCE; and financial viability of the autonomous&#13;
self-financing beneficiaries (SLRA, SLAA, RTA) and their capacity to maintain competitive&#13;
salaries and inceitives to attract and retain qualified staff.&#13;
In conclusion Mr. President, I wish to assure you that the Govemment of Sierra Leone attaches the&#13;
highest priority to the implementation of the policies outlined above.&#13;
Your sincerely,&#13;

TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT INVESTMENT COMPONENT&#13;
GENERAL&#13;
1.    The Transport Sector Project provides financial assistance for the implementation of a four&#13;
year time slice (1996-1999) of the 10-year investment programs developed by the SLRA, the&#13;
SLPA and the SLAA, and for Coastal and River Transport, on the basis of the Transport Sector&#13;
Policy adopted by the MTCE/the Government- The investment programs were discussed during&#13;
the Donor's Conference held in June 1995 with the participation of EU, AfDB, UNDP and IDA.&#13;
Other donors are in various stages of discussions with SLRA, including the Kuwait Fund, Qatar&#13;
Fund and IsDB. In the road sector, the program also builds upon the RRMP and ASSP presently&#13;
being carried out with financing from EU, UNDP and IDA. The main elements of the 1996-1999&#13;
investment programs, their costs, schedule and secured or anticipated financing are shown in&#13;
Annex 4-3 of the Staff Appraisal Report where the numbering system and the nomenclature used in&#13;
the 10-year programs of the various authorities and entities have been maintained as much as&#13;
possible in order to ease follow-up and monitoring.&#13;
(a)    Roads: reconstruction of 482 km of paved roads that have deteriorated and partly reverted&#13;
to gravel roads because of years of neglect of maintenance, construction having already started on&#13;

Costs estimates for the various program components the IDA credit will support are summanrzed&#13;
on the table in Annex 4-1 of the Staff Appraisal Report. The essential details of the program and&#13;
IDA supported (TSP) components are described in more details below.&#13;
ROAD SUBSECTOR&#13;
2.    The road conmponent (Map IBRD 27951) is a four year time slice (1996-1999) of the 10-&#13;
year investment program including all planned expenditures for reconstruction, deferred periodic&#13;
maintenance and periodic and routine maintenance of the national road network and the local roads&#13;
and streets during the period, and the technical assistance and training required to implement the&#13;
Sierra Leone strategy for the road sector. The overall goal of the program is to progressively catch&#13;
up with rehabilitation and deferred maintenance with donor assistance while using self generated&#13;
funds to progressively increase the share of the road network under routine maintenance and to&#13;
carry out periodic maintenance. The four-year road program has been scaled back by some&#13;
US$55 million relative to the initial planning (July 1995) and is now estimated to cost&#13;
US$272 million excluding price and physical contingencies.&#13;
3.     The paved roads rehabilitation/reconstruction program (US$122 million) covers&#13;
reconstruction of the 63 km Peninsular Road, reconstruction of the 109 km Sierra Leonean section&#13;
of the Freetown-Conakry Road, completion of the reconstruction of the 121 km Taima-Bo-Kenema&#13;
road, and start of rehabilitation works on the 199 km Matotoka-Sefadu road. Peninsular Road:&#13;
reconstruction of the Peninsular Road (US$48 million) is planned in three sections and work has&#13;
started on the Kent Village-Kent Junction-Waterloo section where two contracts are financed by&#13;
the Kuwait Fund. Approaches are being made to EU and the Qatar Fund to finance the other two&#13;
sections. A new feasibility study is required as the existing study dates from 1983 when it was&#13;
found already that traffic had suffered a severe decline because of the deteriorating paved road&#13;
condition. Justification for this investment would lie largely in economic development of the&#13;
Peninsula area which includes the highest potential tourist sites in Sierra Leone. Freetown-&#13;
Conakrv Road: reconstruction of the Sierra Leonean section (US$33 million) of this regional road&#13;
including a bridge over the Rokel Creek to replace the current ferry crossing will improve the road&#13;
connection to Conakry. Plans and contract documents have already been prepared. Financing,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
although not concluded is planned under EU Lome IV. The Rogbere-Lunsar-Makeni Road is the&#13;
principal link to the rich agricultural an mining areas of the North and Northeast. Traffic is over&#13;
500 v.p.d. Because it has not had periodic maintenance in the 20 years since its construction the&#13;
pavement and shoulders are in need of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of the Taima-Bo-Kenema&#13;
Road had been started with IDA financing under RRMP but contracts had to be terminated&#13;
because of the rebel war. Financing for resumption and completion of works has yet to be&#13;
identified. Matotoka-Sefadu is another road whose periodic maintenance neglect has brought&#13;
about the needs for its rehabilitation. The rehabilitation was scheduled to be contracted in 1994&#13;
with AfDB financing within the framework of RRMP but tendering was canceled because of&#13;
insecurity in the area. AfDB whose financing was canceled will be approached to finance the&#13;
rehabilitation once security is reestablished in the area.&#13;
4.    Paving of strategic gravel roads. It is envisaged to pave six strategic gravel main roads&#13;
(482 kIn) dunrng the 10-year program. However, only the first stage improvement of the Lungi-&#13;
Port Loko Road (62 kIn) comprising reshaping and spot regravelling is included in the Four-Year&#13;
program (therefore shown on Map IBRD 27951 as reshaping/regravelling of gravel main roads).&#13;
Lungi-Port Loko is a link in the sole road connection between Freetown and the Lungi Airport.&#13;
This work will be financed on the IDA Credit. Detailed studies and tender documents remain to be&#13;
done.&#13;
5.    Deferred periodic maintenance of main paved roads. Four roads (221 km) are scheduled&#13;
for deferred periodic maintenance consisting of patching and overlays or resealing during the 10-&#13;
year program, and are all included in the initial Four-Year time slice. The IDA credit will finance&#13;
works on the first road section in that program, Tagrin Point-Lungi Airport. The Tagrin Point-&#13;
Lungi Airport Road traveled by 800 v.p.a ,ill be patchod, the shoulders repaired, and will receive&#13;
a general ox erlay. Detailed studies and tender documents remain to be prepared. The Bo-&#13;
Koribundu-Bandajuma Road whose traffic is estimated at 400 v.p.d will be patched and resealed.&#13;
Heavy patching and overlay is planned for the last two roads, Masiaka-Mile 91 and Makeni-&#13;
Fadugu-Kabala . Detailed studies will be carried out to evaluate the road condition and determine&#13;
the final engineering solution, especially as regards the second road which carries an estimated 280&#13;
v.p.d.&#13;
6.     Rehabilitation of gravel main roads. Six gravel roads are planned to be rehabilitated in the&#13;
10-year program. However, only the first stage of the rehabilitation of the Panlap Jct. Kamakwie&#13;
Road, consisting of drainage repairs and construction and spot regravelling is included in the Four-&#13;
Year program.&#13;
7.    Reshaping/Regravelling of Gravel Main Roads: This sub-program comprises 1229 km of&#13;
gravel main roads to be reshaped and regrave!led during the 1997-1999 period at an average cost&#13;
of US$10,000/km. Traffic varies between 20 and 150 v.p.d. Studies to determine the detail of the&#13;
works are being carnred out by a Consultant on 500 km located in relatively secured areas. This&#13;
program will be the main proving ground for the development of medium size contractors to road&#13;
works (see para. 11 below).&#13;
8.    Feeder roads. Feeder roads are the lowest classification in the National Road Network.&#13;
One thousand six hundred kilometers are to be rehabilitated ($10,000/kin) or "spot-improved"&#13;
($3,700/kin) under the ongoing ASSP, and EU and NCAP funded programs, and the TSP.&#13;
Rehabilitation includes the construction of a continuous laterite wearing course whereas spot&#13;
improvement includes laterite wearing course only on selected stretches of the road. Funding of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

remaining 410 kn, completing the 2000 km Four-Year Program, is being searched. All the feeder&#13;
roads part of the various programs have been identified, except for a few sections of the ASSP&#13;
program now being relocated in the safer Lungi and Northeast location (240 Iam) where altemative&#13;
sections are being chosen in conjunction with Ministry of Agriculture, because of the lack of&#13;
security. The IDA supported ASSP is to improve 510 km of feeder roads while training&#13;
contractors to labor intensive methods. Ten contractors have already been trained. These&#13;
contractors are expected to lease/purchase a portion of the equipment necessary to carry out the&#13;
works (they presently rent the equipment - agricultural tractors, etc.) and will be in a position to&#13;
bid for works. Works under that program had to be relocated. There remains about 240 km to be&#13;
improved by the small contractors under that program. The TSP will support, with IDA financing,&#13;
the improvement of 550 km of feeder roads ( see Map IIBRD 2795 1) located in the Westem area of&#13;
the country.&#13;
9.     Urban Roads and Streets. Programs underway incl de the reconstruction of the Clinetown&#13;
Wellington Road and of 20 km of Central Business District Roads in Freetown, both under RRMP&#13;
and with IDA financing. Also ongoing is a program for the rehabilitation of 16 km of streets&#13;
outside the CBD in Freetown under the FIRP also with IDA assistance. The TSP IDA credit will&#13;
support the rehabilitation of 20 km of major streets in Up-Country Towns (Bo, Kenema, Makeni,&#13;
Mile 91, Port Loko) whose riding condition is fair to poor (US $1.60 million). Existing drainage&#13;
system will be repaired or improved, distressed road sections will be rebuilt with laterite or crushed&#13;
rocks road base and overlaid with Dense Bitumen Macadam (DBM) while road surfaces with poor&#13;
condition will be improved with DBM and asphalt concrete surfacing. No street maps are&#13;
available of up-country towns. The list of streets is shown below. Studies and tender documents&#13;
(and supervision) will be prepared by consultants with SLRA Development Department,&#13;
procurement by ICB. Rehabilitation of additional roads in Freetown is planned as well as the&#13;
construction of the Freetown Hillside Road, a bypass around Freetown to alleviate present&#13;
congestion, preferred over the Coastal Bypass for superior economnic justification and lower cost.&#13;

10.    Routine and Periodic Maintenance. SLRA has developed a five-year 1996-2000 routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance, road fund financed, program and budget presented herein on page 8.&#13;
Individual road sections to benefit from the various types of periodic maintenance works, heavy&#13;
grading, regravelling, resealing, and overlay have all been identified (TSP Project Files). The&#13;
program/budget also includes a summary of the EU funded Trunk Road Small Projects, providing&#13;
drainage and pavement rehabilitation/reconstruction of city streets in conjunction with the&#13;
development of small contractors; the list of streets is also in TSP Project Files. District Council&#13;
Roads to be maintained with funds from a share of the Road Fund levy (.01 to .02 cents per liter)&#13;
remain to be identified. Also appearing on the summary is the feeder road program (see para. 8)&#13;
carned out by the Feeder Road Department.&#13;
11.    Development of Contractors Small and Medium. While in 1996 40% of the routine&#13;
maintenance and none of the periodic maintenance works are executed by contractors SLRA plans&#13;
to increase private sector participation to 90% by 1999. The privatization schedule for&#13;
maintenance works is as follows.&#13;

Due to traditional force account maintenance operations there is no local private capacity for&#13;
mechanized routine and periodic maintenance in Sierra Leone. There is however a core of local&#13;
building contractors. The project will create an environment favorable to the development of a&#13;
local contracting industry in the road sector by opening the market for mechanized road works to&#13;
the private sector and ensuring a reasonable annual work volume, by making SLRA owned&#13;
equipment available for hire, by preparing contracts of scope and size carefully chosen to attain the&#13;
objective. Payment procedures are already adequate to ensure timely payment of contractors. The&#13;
SLRA Equipment Division will become a profit center within SLRA, in effect being transformed&#13;
into a Plant Pool which will rent equipment at commercial rates to both force account brigades and&#13;
private contractors. The possibility of using equipment lease/purchase agreements between SLRA&#13;
and local building contractors is also being considered. SLRA does not have all the equipment&#13;
necessary to attain these objectives and there are no other local operations in Sierra Leone owning&#13;
such equipment. The TSP IDA credit will finance the acquisition of US$3.7 million worth of&#13;
selected construction and workshop equipment. The tentative list finalized at negotiations is shown&#13;
below. Additional equipment requirement will be submitted for donor financing. Bidding for&#13;

works on gravel roads, particularly the TSP IDA financed reshaping/regravelling of gravel main&#13;
roads will be opened to Contractors who may not be able to demonstrate previous realization in the&#13;
road sector but can demonstrate sufficient annual tumover, financial capacity, and the availability&#13;
of essential experienced personnel such as highway engineer with road construction or maintenance&#13;
experience, works superintendent, topographer. Transformation of the Equipment Division into a&#13;
Plant Pool is the first stage of its transfomiation into a share company. IDA credit will finance&#13;
studies and preparation of legal documents for the second stage.&#13;

12.    Technical Assistance: The Four-Year program includes technical assistance financed by&#13;
EU, UNDP, and IDA to support further development of SLRA and implementation of proposed&#13;
structural reforms that would transform the existing "Equipment Department", which supports&#13;
force account operations, into a self-accounting profit center. The TSP would finance extension of&#13;
the contract of the Equipment Management Specialist presently financed by UNDP.&#13;
13.    Expansion of Training School and Training Program: The TSP will finance the&#13;
reconstruction and expansion of the training school facilities at Mile 91 estimated at US$660,000.&#13;
The TSP will also finance US $ 740,000 out of the proposed US $1.44 million SLRA three-year&#13;
training program for 1996-1998, including fellowships, short courses and participation to&#13;
Intemational Conferences and Seminars to be mutually agreed during implementation.&#13;
FREETOWN PORT&#13;
14.    Repair of the Clinetown Slipway is the highest priority investment, essential for continuous&#13;
ferry operations; the TSP will finance provision and installation of a cradle, rail lines and haulage&#13;
gear, and supervision of the works. The Port Rehabilitation Contract - Phase I (see Map IBRD&#13;
27952) includes the essential maintenance to the quays, block paving of the container stacking area&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

and access roads, and minor improvements (drainage and lighting) of the newly paved areas.&#13;
Supervision will also be financed under the TSP.&#13;
COASTAL AND RIVER TRANSPORT&#13;
15.    Based on the conclusions of the Coastal and River Transport Study financed with PPF&#13;
funds, provision of 37 storage buildings and 9 piers suitable for pampers (local boats) at 35&#13;
selected landing locations. Building and landings standards and types have been determined based&#13;
on local sites and river traffic. Final determination will be made in participation with boat&#13;
operators, neighboring villagers and transport users. Detailed engineering and supervision will be&#13;
financed under the TSP.&#13;
FREETOWN FERRY&#13;
16.   Provision for two 150 passenger capacity ferries and of adapted landing facilities (floating&#13;
pontoon and/or pier) at Tagrin and Government Wharf. Financing of the two ferries will be sought&#13;
from other donors.&#13;
LUNGI AIRPORT&#13;
17.   Investment planned at Lrmgi airport comprise runway repair, rehabilitation of instrument&#13;
landing system, procurement of safety equipment and protective fencing. These investment aim at&#13;
keeping the airport in close conformity to ICAO security regulations. One contract will be let to&#13;
improve existing fences and to complete fencing the airport perimeter to prevent pedestrian and&#13;
animal traffic from entering the runway; the tender documents have been prepared under the PPF.&#13;
T-he second contract is for runway repairs (joint replacement and wide cracks repairs) essential to&#13;
postpone major rehabilitation about another 10 years, pavement markings, provision of edge&#13;
lighting and PAPI installation at the threshold to replace obsolete systems, and minimum&#13;
improvements to runway shoulders by stabilizing the surface on a three meter width. Supervision&#13;
of both contracts will also be financed under the TSP. The TSP will also finance provision of a&#13;
8,000 liter foam tender for fire protection to replace the obsolete and inadequate existing one and a&#13;
small sea rescue craft necessary because of the proximity to the sea.&#13;

ROAD FUND - REVENUE STRucruRi&#13;
1.    This annex sunmarizes the analysis on the revenue structure of the road fund in Sierra&#13;
Leone, which was discussed in depth by Task Force, comprising MTCE, SLRA and IDA, during&#13;
the appraisal mission. The detailed analysis is contained in the Task Force Report in the Project&#13;
Files.&#13;
2.    The Table B on page 2 of this Annex shows the new revenue structure of the Road Fund.&#13;
The Table C on page 3 of this Annex presents revenues to be generated through these user charges&#13;
with and without implernmfing new increased charges. Also, general revenue from excise on fuel&#13;
and import duty on fuel is presented.&#13;
3.    In Table C, it is projected that, without impletnenting new charges, the Road Fund will be&#13;
able to finance only 35 to 76% of the expenditures required for the planned routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance plan for the year 1996-2005. Also, it is projected that with the imnplementation of the&#13;
new user charges as described in Table B, it will not only cover adequately the maintenance plan&#13;
1996-2005 but also the operational costs of newly established RTA.&#13;

4.    The proposed license fees may seem a major increase from the current level; however, it is&#13;
rather conservative by standards in similar countries, which average $75 for a car, $500 for a bus&#13;
or medium truck, and $2,500 for an articulated truck.&#13;

Assumptions for Financial Projections&#13;
A.    Income Statement&#13;
1.    Passenger and cargo traffic growth will increase by an average of 5% in 1996 and&#13;
thereafter. The significant increase in revenues in 1995 is due to an increase in landing fees. In&#13;
1997 and 1998, Sierra Leone gains back its intemational appeal with tourists.&#13;
2.     Staff related costs will increase by 15% in 1996 and by I% thereafter. The significant&#13;
increase of staff related costs in 1996 is due to the hiring of additional staff to help management&#13;
match intemational safety and quality standards necessary to keep the airline companies flying into&#13;
the country.&#13;
3.     Stocks increase by 1.5% each year. Creditors are assuned to be equivalent to 60 days of&#13;
sales and debtors are assumed to be 90 days of sales throughout the period under consideration.&#13;
Taxation for each year has been averaged at 47% of earnings after interest payments. The&#13;
percentage is the average used in Sierra Leone for SLAA in the past and for similar entities. This&#13;
represents a net transfer of funds from the entity to the State of Sierra Leone.&#13;
B.    Balance Sheet and Funds Flow Stateents&#13;
4.     The investment program totals US $8,793,300 and will be undertaken from 1996 to 2005.&#13;
It is assumed that SLAA would finance 80% of the total yearly investment program and 100% of&#13;
the training costs for management in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Other donors will finance a varying&#13;
percentage of the program during the later years.&#13;
5.     External Loans are provided by two types of donors: IDA and other donors. The IDA&#13;
credit will be on-lent at an interest rate of 6.9% over 20 years including a 5-year grace period, with&#13;
disbursements starting in 1996 and ending in December 1999. The other donors credits will be on-&#13;
lent at an interest rate of 6.9% over 20 years including a 5-year grace period, with disbursements&#13;
starting in January 1997 and ending in 2005. During the five-year grace period of the loan,&#13;
interests payments have been capitalized.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
SIERRA LEONE PORTS AUTHORITY&#13;
Assumptions for Financial Projections&#13;
A      Income Statement&#13;
1.    Port operations and cargo traffic growth will increase by an average of 5% to 6% a year&#13;
throughout the entire period under consideration, except in 1997 and 1988, when traffic increases&#13;
by 10% and 8%, respectively. Salaries and wages are assumed to increase by an average 4%&#13;
throughout the entire period under consideration. Salaries and wages are separate from&#13;
management fees, which are canceled after 1997.&#13;
2.     For analysis purposes, the value of the fixed assets of SLPA were revalued as of March&#13;
31, 1996 to be US$94,000,000. Taxation for each year is levied at 47% of earnings after interest&#13;
payments and after taking a depreciation charge based on historical valuation of assets, rather than&#13;
charging depreciation on revalued assets. The percentage is the average used in Sierra Leone for&#13;
SLPA in the past and for similar entities. This represents a net transfer of funds from the entity to&#13;
the State of Sierra Leone.&#13;
B.    Balance Sheet and Funds Flow Statements&#13;
3.    Investments are mostly financed by extemal donors. The total investment program&#13;
submitted by SLPA has been considered for the purpose of these financial projections. The&#13;
investment program, which totals US$48.7 million, lasts from 1996 to 2005, inclusive. SLPA will&#13;
finance a varying percentage of the total yearly investment program.&#13;
4.    The IDA credit of US$8,300,000 will be onlent at an interest rate of 6.9% over 20 years&#13;
including a 5-year grace period, with disbursements starting in 1997 and ending in December 1998.&#13;
The other donor credits will also be onlent at an interest rate of 6.9% over 20 years including a&#13;
five-year grace period. During the five-year grace period, interest payments have been capitalized.&#13;
5.     Stocks are assumed to be equivalent to 10% of gross sales volume throughout the entire&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    This annex presents economic analysis of the IDA-financed componernts of the Transport&#13;
Sector Project, consisting of five subsectors (road, road transport, port rehabilitation, water&#13;
transport, and air transport).&#13;
A.  ROAD REHABILITATION COMPONENT&#13;
2.     Two typical road sections totaling 77 km to be rehabilitated at an estimated cost of&#13;
$2 million were analyzed with the Highway Design and Maintenance Model m (HDM) to verify&#13;
analyses carried out for SLRA by various consultants. The programmed works include reshaping,&#13;
spot regravelling, and deferred maintenance. Table 1-a summarizes the road characteristics.&#13;
3.    The economic benefits are calculated by estimating savings in vehicle operating costs&#13;
(VOCs) and maintenance costs. Benefits to road users were computed on the basis of the&#13;
consumer surplus, taken as half the unit VOCs reduction times the generated traffic. The economic&#13;
indicators calculated are the net present value (NPV) and the internal rates of return (EIRR), using&#13;
economic user costs and investment costs.&#13;
4.     Altemative civil works that were evaluated ranged from minimal routine maintenance on&#13;
the existing roads to pavement rehabilitation or complete reconstruction of the road. Available&#13;
data on the existing conditions of the roads showed that most roads under consideration were in&#13;
poor or very poor condition with roughness values in excess of IRI 8.5. Hence, for these roads,&#13;
alternatives involving only resurfacing options such as resealing or thin overlays, were technically&#13;
ruled out. For unpaved roads, rehabilitation of at least portions of the roadbed prior to regravelling&#13;
is required.&#13;
5.    Costs were considered in both financial and economic terms (after adjusting for taxes and&#13;
duties). The highly deteriorated condition of many roads causes VOCs to be very high, but lacking&#13;
viable altemate routes, users cannot avoid such costs. Some reduction in trips has undoubtedly&#13;
occurred because of poor road conditions. Consequently, rehabilitation and a return to nomnal&#13;
traffic pattems after the security situation improves will lead to higher traffic. Therefore, initial&#13;
traffic increase is assumed to be as high as 30% for light vehicles. Estimated future traffic growth&#13;
in Sierra Leone ranges from 3% to 6% per annum depending on vehicle type for the first five years&#13;
of the analysis period; it drops to a steady 3% for all vehicle types thereafter.&#13;
6.     Table 1-b presents a summary of the economic analysis of the entire road investment&#13;
component of the Credit, totaling 1,027 km and $9.55 million. The weighted average of the EIRR&#13;
of the whole component yields 25%, and an NPV of $8.0 million discounted at 12%. The result of&#13;
the sensitivity analysis using a 10% cost-overrun and an implementation delay by one year is&#13;
summarized in Table 1-c, which shows that the base EIRR decreases from 25% to 22% with the&#13;
cost-overrun and to 17% with the implementation delay. The employment to be generated by this&#13;
component is estimated to be approximately 1,600 person-years for unskilled labor (para. 18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

86                                     Annex 6-1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
7.     All other non-road investment components, consisting of (1) development of small and&#13;
medium contractors, (2) expansion of training school facilities, (3) training program, (4)&#13;
consultancies for final design and supervision, (5) technical assistance to SLRA, and (6)&#13;
consultancies for institutional studies of SLRA, are expected to yield substantial economic benefits&#13;
which are difficult to quantify.&#13;
B.  ROAD TRANSPORT COMPONENT&#13;
8.     The proposed IDA-financed investments are (1) improvements in Traffic System&#13;
Management (TSM) in Freetown and (2) technical and logistical assistance to RTA. The&#13;
economic benefits of the investment component (traffic management) have been calculated. The&#13;
following investment totaling US$2.0 million has been proposed: (i) improvements of 21 major&#13;
road intersections, (ii) construction of an off-street parking lot, (iii) installation of parking&#13;
prohibition signs, (iv) provision of lay bys, (v) one-way street operations, (vi) on-street parking&#13;
pavement markings, (vii) installation of on-street parking time limit signs, and (viii) installation of&#13;
miscellaneous traffic signs.&#13;
9.     The main benefits from the above investments are improvement in traffic safety and&#13;
savings in transportation in terms of time and VOCs. While safety benefits are difficult to&#13;
quantify. The system wide vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT), vehicle-hours traveled (VHT), and&#13;
average speeds, both with and without the TSM improvements, were calculated. Table 2-a&#13;
presents an EIRR of 25% and a NPV of $1.6 million, discounted at 12%. The result of the&#13;
sensitivity analysis with a 10% cost-overrun and an one year implementation delay shows that the&#13;
base EIRR decreases to 23% with the 10% cost-overrun and to 21% with the one-year&#13;
implementation delay.&#13;
C.  PORT REHABILITATION COMPONENT&#13;
10.   The IDA-financed rehabilitation of the Port of Freetown which includes (1) deferred&#13;
maintenance, (2) paving of the unsurfaced area of the port, with emphasis on the container&#13;
marshaling area, (3) rehabilitation of the slipway, and (4) minor improvements. A cost-benefit&#13;
analysis was conducted for all components, with the exception of the minor improvements,&#13;
including the addition of roads, electricity, lighting, communications, customs facilities and&#13;
drainage for the container terminal, plus drainage, lighting and fendering at other berths. While&#13;
these are key components of port rehabilitation, the benefits are difficult to quantify.&#13;
11.    The US$2 million deferred maintenance program will bring the existing facilities up to&#13;
standard, after years of neglected maintenance. The main benefits are avoidance of greater costs in&#13;
the future. Without remedial work to offset the current lack of maintenance, it is assumed that a&#13;
complete reconstruction would be necessary after 20 years. The approximate cost of&#13;
reconstructing the Fredown port is estimated at $ 60 million. Table 3-a presents an NPV for this&#13;
component of $1.7 million using a 12% discount rate, and an EIRR of 14%. The sensitivity&#13;
analysis of risks using a 10% cost-overrun and a one year implementation delay does not affect the&#13;
EIRR.&#13;
12.    The main economic benefits of paving the container terminal, costing US$4.3 million, are&#13;
(i) reduced damage to handling equipment, (ii) faster operations when serving the ships' cranes,&#13;
and (iii) avoidance of high maintenance and repair costs at the unpaved terminal. Item (i) was&#13;
estimated by the savings in annual maintenance costs with a paved terminal and without a paved&#13;
tenninal, and was estimated as US$10 per TEU, item (ii) was assumed to be US$10 per TEU, and&#13;
item (iii) was assumed to be US$50,000 per year. The NPV of this component is estimated at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
US$1.0 million, with 12% discount rate, and the EIRR is 16%. The sensitivity analysis using a&#13;
10% cost-overrun reduces this to 15%, and a one year implementation delay reduces this to 14%.&#13;
13.   The benefits from the US$1.6 million rehabilitation of the slipway are difficult to express&#13;
in EIRR terms, since without a slipway workshop, a ship needing repairs would have to be towed&#13;
to the dosest workshop in Abidjan or Dakar, which would be too costly. Consequendy, savings in&#13;
current marine engineering 0 &amp; M cost were used as a proxy for economic benefits. The NPV of&#13;
this component is estimated to be US$4.4 million, using a 12% discount rate, and the EIRR is&#13;
57%. The sensitivity analysis with a 10% cost-overrun reduces this to 49%, and a one year&#13;
implementation delay reduced this to 40%.&#13;
14.   The overall EIRR using a weighted average is 24% with an NPV of US$7.1 million&#13;
discounted at 12%. The sensitivity analysis a 10% cost-overrun reduces the EIRR to 22%, and the&#13;
one year implementation delay reduces it to 20%.&#13;
D.  WATER TRANSPORT COMPONENT&#13;
16.   The economic analysis of the US$1.8 million Phase I investments was carried out.&#13;
Though the detailed scope of work is yet to be determined, the purpose of this phase is to&#13;
implement a short-tern pilot project within the capabilities of local contractors, consisting of&#13;
rehabilitation and provision of landing and storage facilities. Five typical Phase I landings being&#13;
considered were analyzed and summarized in Table 4-a. Main benefits are cost savings for vessel,&#13;
passengers, handling and spoilage. The costs of works at each landing ranges from US$0.1 to&#13;
US$0.6 million, and the EIRRs range from 16% to 97% and the NPVs range from US$0.0 to&#13;
US$1.2 million, discounted at 12%. Sensitivity analyses with a cost-overrun of 15%, a decrease in&#13;
benefits by 15%, and a combination of the two, yielded EIRRs ranging from 8% to 83%.&#13;
E.   AIR TRANSPORT COMPONENT&#13;
17.   The IDA-financed portion of the airport component, costing US$2.74 million, consists of&#13;
(1) aerodrome civil works (evaluation of runway pavement strength, runway improvement, and&#13;
perimeter fencing), (2) terminal building improvement, (3) airfield lighting, (4) aerodrome services&#13;
equipment (fire tender and rescue boat), and (5) technical training. The main benefits are enhanced&#13;
security, time savings in airport operations, and savings in maintenance, the latter being estimated&#13;
for the analysis. As summarized in Table 5-a, the NPV is estimated to be US$0.7 million,&#13;
discounted at 12%, and the ERR is estimated at 19%. The sensitivity analysis with a cost-overrun&#13;
of 10% reduces the EIRR to 17%, and a one year implementation delay reduces it to 16%.&#13;
F.  EMPLOYMENT GENERATION&#13;
18.   The employment to be generated by the project was estimated for unskilled labor in IDA-&#13;
financed civil work of the US$9.6 million road component. The baseline assumptions were:&#13;
(1) unskilled labor represented 5 % of total cost, (2) the entire work requires four years for&#13;
completion, during which temporary unskilled labor is employed for the duration of 20 days per&#13;
month and 9 months per year, and (3) average annual salary is US$150. It is estimated that 1,600&#13;
person-year of employment will be generated.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The proposed Transport Sector Project has been placed under environmental category B,&#13;
as consistent with the Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E: Environmental Assessment. In&#13;
accordance with the directive, an environmental assessment was carried-out for the proposed&#13;
project and in addition, a specific study on the port rehabilitation was prepared. The final report&#13;
containing an environmental analysis and a mitigation plan addressing the environmental impact of&#13;
the project was presented to IDA in June 1995 and the final draft of the Port Rehabilitation Study&#13;
was presented to IDA in January 1996 (see Project File). The main environmental impacts&#13;
incurred under the project are due to the following project components: (1) the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of roads; (2) the rehabilitation of the Freetown Port; (3) the improvement of the&#13;
existing port; and (4) the improvement of landing facilities in inland and coastal waterways. The&#13;
improvement of the Freetown Airport is not expected to incur any significant environmental&#13;
impacts. The TSP will include the appointment of an environmental coordinator at the CMU from&#13;
MCTE's Environmental Department to coordinate the environmental activities in the ministry with&#13;
other institutions.&#13;
Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads&#13;
2.    Environmental Impact. The program for periodic and routine maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation of the public road network will have several environmental impacts:&#13;
*     soil erosion: the planned works under this component will cause some disruption to&#13;
the vegetation cover, which will make the uppermost soil layers susceptible to&#13;
erosion during times of heavy rainfall, particularly on slopes and hilly areas;&#13;
*     potential disturbance to protected areas: some of the road sections under the TSP&#13;
interfere with protected forests;&#13;
sand resources: sand for the construction works is extracted from sandy beaches at&#13;
the peninsula. This results in coastal erosion and conflicts with tourism interests&#13;
and coastal settlements.&#13;
3.     Mitization Measures. Appropriate mitigation measures will minimize the negative impact&#13;
on the environment.&#13;
*      Soil erosion from road construction works can be reduced by several means:&#13;
land clearance during construction works can be minimized by:&#13;
minimizing the width of the working zone; utilizing the ditched-up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

material from side drains as road construction material instead of using&#13;
borrow pits (depending on the properties of the soil material); and&#13;
establishing borrow pits close to the roads to avoid the construction of&#13;
significant sections of temporary roads;&#13;
-      the roads can be designed to protect the road and surrounding areas&#13;
against erosion. Possible protection measures include: reinforcement of&#13;
cut slopes by introducing steps each of which having drain ditches,&#13;
reinforcement of filled slopes and embankments by adding excess fill and&#13;
subsequent compaction; strengthening of slope surfaces by plarnting grass;&#13;
implementation of proper road drain systems, including side drains,&#13;
culverts and possibly outlets at appropriate intervals; and preventing&#13;
drains against collapsing by strengthening the drain surface (e.g. by&#13;
planting grass and in some cases by surfacing the drains with concrete).&#13;
*      Potential disturbance to protected areas: the exact extent of interference with&#13;
protected areas has to be clarified dunng the design phase, and a specific&#13;
mitigation plan must be prepared to remediate the potential conflicts between road&#13;
works and protected nature. SLRA must inspect the road work to ensure that the&#13;
work comply with the prescribed mitigative procedures. Realignment of the road&#13;
may be considered.&#13;
v      Sand resources: the coastal erosion can be reduced by implementing coast&#13;
protection, such as groynes, at regular intervals.&#13;
4.     Iumpact on Human Safety. Labor based road work constitutes a considerable occupational&#13;
health risk due to several factors, including difficult physical working conditions, exposure to dust&#13;
and bituminous vapors, and exposure to vibrations and noise from machines. Overall, the road&#13;
improvements will introduce an increased risk of accidents due to a generally higher speed of the&#13;
motorized traffic and due to an expected increase in traffic amounts.&#13;
5.     Mitigation Measures. Measures to reduce occupational health and safety risks include&#13;
adequate training and education of personnel, use of appropriate personal protective equipment,&#13;
dust suppression during dry seasons, maintenance of facilities and equipment of designed or&#13;
regulated level of performance, and proper operational procedures and occupational health&#13;
standards. Measures to mitigate adverse effects include separation of non-motorized traffic from&#13;
the motorized by establishment of footpaths, establishment of lay-bys for buses and taxis to&#13;
prevent against traffic congestion, introduction of speed reduction measures in town and village&#13;
streets, and proper road marking. In addition surfacing of town and village roads will allow a more&#13;
uniform speed and partially prevent dust generation. Traffic safety measures should be&#13;
particularly addressed for town and village roads and heavily trafficked trunk roads.&#13;
Road Transport&#13;
6.     A Road Transport Authority (RTA) is being established under the TSP to coordinate road&#13;
transport planning and management, to undertake inspection and testing of vehicles and drivers,&#13;
and to undertake surveys and studies to plan and monitor the development within this area. This&#13;
includes designating and upgrading private workshops to vehicles examination centers that would&#13;
undertake regular vehicle standard examinations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
7.     The key environmental issue related to the road transport is the extremely poor state of the&#13;
current Sierra Leonean vehicle fleet, which leads to extensive emissions of air pollutants. It is&#13;
recommended that an environmental unit be set-up under the RTA to meet the most urgent&#13;
demands for environmental protection capability in road transport planning and management. The&#13;
following actions are recommended:&#13;
*      appointment of an environmental specialist to address the following issues:&#13;
(1) road transport planning and management; (2) general quality standards for&#13;
imported second hand vehicles, including emission standards, (3) fuel quality&#13;
standards; (4) traffic safety measures; and (5) coordination of actions and policies&#13;
with the environmental coordinator at the CMU;&#13;
*      training of the environmental specialist to achieve adequate qualifications;&#13;
*      workshops and/or seminars for management and staff at RTA to increase&#13;
environmental awareness; and&#13;
*      technical assistance to implement and monitor the proposed actions.&#13;
8.     The tasks of the environmental unit at the RTA will include among other things:&#13;
preparation of environmental standards for vehicle emissions, fuel quality, etc. to&#13;
be approved by the Environmental Protection Secretariat (EPS);&#13;
performance of workshops, seminars and training in accordance with the proposed&#13;
institutional strengthening actions;&#13;
*      preparation of environmental terms for the proposed vehicle examination centers&#13;
and subsequent supervision and control thereof;&#13;
*      proposal of incentives to encourage vehicle operators to adopt standards; and&#13;
*      preparation of terms of reference for specific studies, including a transport&#13;
planning and management study for Freetown.&#13;
The Rehabilitation of the Freetown Port&#13;
9.     The port rehabilitation component covers the rehabilitation of port roads, storage areas,&#13;
sheds and equipment, investigation of the quay wall and coping, slipway repair and paving of the&#13;
container stacking area. A separate port rehabilitation study was executed as part of the TSP (see&#13;
Project File). The project components are not expected to have any significant impact on the&#13;
surrounding land and water. Diving inspections to examine the current conditions along the quay&#13;
have indicated that beside some floating garbage, no visible sign of pollution was observed and that&#13;
there was some marine life present in the waters.&#13;
10.    The potential sources of pollution within the port are discharges from industrial activity,&#13;
workshops and shipyards, loading and unloading of ships, dredging and dumping of material from&#13;
the port. The level of discharges caused by industrial activity, workshops and shipyards, and the&#13;
loading and unloading of ships might rise slightly due to increased activity in the port area once the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 8&#13;
rehabilitation is begun and the port facility is enhanced. In particular, the likelihood of an oil spill&#13;
will increase. The level of dredging is not expected to increase and the risk of hazardous&#13;
substances accumulating in the in the sediment is small.&#13;
11.    A system of procedures for collecting the sewage, solid waste, and waste oil will be put in&#13;
place according to the increase in activities in the port. The following activities will be carried out:&#13;
*      establishment of oil waste reception and treatment facilities at the port;&#13;
*      implementation of an oil spill contingency plan for Sierra Leone; the Oil Spill&#13;
Contingency Plan for Freetown and Environs was prepared in November 1994.&#13;
The plan details procedures to be followed for identification of risks and&#13;
monitoring, as well as for response strategies; however, the necessary equipment&#13;
remains to be acquired,&#13;
*      implementation of proper operational procedures, occupational health and safety&#13;
procedures and hazard management procedures, and&#13;
*      clean-up of port areas-on-shore as well as off-shore; including removal of scrap&#13;
and wrecks and clean-up of contaminated soil and sediments.&#13;
In addition, a study to examine the potential impact of port activities on spawning and fishing areas&#13;
will be undertaken.&#13;
The Coastal and River Transport Component&#13;
12.    Environmental Impact. A number of potentially severe adverse environmental impacts can&#13;
be expected from various activities under this investment package which it is essential to address:&#13;
possible deepening, widening and change of the course of a river will increase the&#13;
drainage of the catchment area, thereby changing the water-balance of the&#13;
catchment area with potentially severe permanent effects on wetland as well as&#13;
agricultural, grassland, and forest ecology. This could be the case for the Sewa&#13;
and the Moa rivers in the eastem part of Sierra Leone. The catchment area of&#13;
Moa River contains a national wild life sanctuary which could be adversely&#13;
affected by an altered water balance. The catchment area of Sewa river includes&#13;
protected forests and large areas of inland swamps, which are vulnerable to&#13;
changes in the water balance;&#13;
*      these effects are particularly significant for protected forest and other types of&#13;
protected nature areas in Sierra Leone. Rivers and estuaries to be prepared or&#13;
improved for inland navigation are not yet determined. Therefore, it is not clear&#13;
whether protected forests or other nature reserves in certain catchment areas will&#13;
be affected;&#13;
*      the change in the hydrological characteristics of rivers may also increase the risk&#13;
of river bank erosion and subsequent flooding of nearby areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97                                        Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
*      river and estuarine flora and fauna may be affected due to several factors,&#13;
including permanent changes of hydrological nature, siltation from dredging&#13;
activities, possible change in salinity of estuaries due to increased supply of fresh&#13;
water to estuaries and due to emissions of pollution, noise, and vibrations from the&#13;
mantime traffic,&#13;
*      disposal (upland disposal or off-shore dumping) of dredged sediments may cause&#13;
varying effects on ecological habitats;&#13;
*      improvement of river and coastal transport will, other things being equal, increase&#13;
the nrsk of oil spills and accidents in rivers and estuaries;&#13;
*      locally, the improvement of ports and jetties may imply adverse environmental&#13;
effects to be mitigated.&#13;
13.    Proposed Actions. Adequate reception and treatment facilities for oily waste are required&#13;
as an indispensable part of the marine infrastructure development as well as the development of a&#13;
set of emergency response actions to unintentional oil spills an accidents. Special attention should&#13;
be paid to the ecologically sensitive wetland areas, such as the extensive mangrove swamps in the&#13;
Bronte area and the swamp areas along the Sewa River. Particularly, the requirement of oily waste&#13;
reception and treatment facilities should be addressed along the potential operation and&#13;
management of hazardous goods.&#13;
14.    Stakeholder participation will be sought at every level of project implementation. SLRA&#13;
will be the agency responsible for implementing this component. It will hire local staff to conduct&#13;
the necessary studies to identify mitigation plans and will ensure that local and national&#13;
stakeholders participate in defining the terms of reference for the studies and plans. The studies for&#13;
each project subcomponent will cover the issues of environmental sustainability, cost recovery, and&#13;
organizational management. IDA will examine and approve the organization, implementation, and&#13;
environmental mitigation aspect of each sub-component prior to disbursement.&#13;
Improvement of Freetown Airport&#13;
15.    The airport component of the TSP includes runway edge light repair, runway pavement&#13;
evaluation, procurement of fire fighting and rescue equipment and perimeter fencing. No&#13;
significant environmental impacts are likely to occur in relation to the proposed activities.&#13;
Coordination of Environmental Activities&#13;
16.    All implementing agencies in the TSP, except for the SLRA, are part of the MCTE, which&#13;
will ensure that the environmental mitigation plan and other related activities will be closely&#13;
monitored and coordinated. To coordinate the environmental activities under the TSP, it is&#13;
recommended that an environmental coordinator be attached to the CMU from MCTE's&#13;
Environmental Department. The tasks of the coordinator will include among other things:&#13;
*      coordination of environmental activities under the TSP, including regular joint&#13;
meetings with the staff handling environmental issues at the implementing&#13;
agencies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                                       Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
*      coordination of activities with other authorities and institutions such as the EPS&#13;
and the Land and Water Development Department (LWDD);&#13;
*      arranging workshops and seminars for management and staff at the transport&#13;
sector authorities and institutions (SLRA, SLPA, SLAA, RTC, RTA, and MSA);,&#13;
*      preparing environmental project progress reports regularly, and&#13;
*     potentially proposing and implementing corrective measures depending on project&#13;
progress.&#13;
Mitigation Plan&#13;
17.    A draft plan to mitigate adverse effects of the TSP has been prepared and will be financed&#13;
under the project. The plan proposes legal, institutional strengthening, training, and technical&#13;
measures to be incorporated in the TSP. It has been approved by the MCTE.&#13;
18.    Legal Measures. The following legal measures are recommended:&#13;
*     preparation of environmental guidelines regarding road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance works;&#13;
*      preparation of proper standards for emission factors and noise from vehicles;&#13;
*      preparation of fuel quality criteria;&#13;
*      preparation of a program for vehicle emission control and fuel quality control;&#13;
*     preparation of proper operational procedures and occupational health and safety&#13;
procedures in connection with road works, vehicle examnination centers, port, and&#13;
airport operations; and&#13;
*      preparation of adequate guidelines and emergency response action plans regarding&#13;
rehabilitation of Freetown Port which is in accordance with the recommendations&#13;
made in the coastal and river transport study.&#13;
19.   Institutional strengthening measures. The following institutional strengthening measures to&#13;
be financed under the TSP are recommended as a minimum to improve upon the environmental&#13;
protection capability within the transport sector in Sierra Leone:&#13;
*      an environmental coordinator should be attached to the CMU from MCTE's&#13;
Environmental Department to coordinate environmental activities under the TSP&#13;
(draft Terms of Reference for the environmental coordinator are presented in the&#13;
Project Files); and&#13;
*     the existing environmental unit under SLRA should be strengthened through&#13;
training of staff in environmental subjects related to road planning, design, and&#13;
construction works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 7 of 8&#13;
20.    Training; Measures. The following environmental training and education measures should&#13;
be included in the TSP:&#13;
*      training of the environmental engneer at the SLRA and possibly also the&#13;
environmental coordinator at MCTE to achieve adequate qualifications,&#13;
*      workshops and seminars for management and staff at the transport sector&#13;
authonties and institutions to increase the general environmental awareness within&#13;
the transport sector in Sierra Leone,&#13;
*      training of SLRA road construction supervisors; and&#13;
*      training of management and supervisoris of private contractors to undertake road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance.&#13;
21.    Technical measures. Regarding the road rehabilitation and maintenance, the mitigation&#13;
measures and remedial actions discussed in Chapter 9 of the final report should be implemented in&#13;
the detalled design of the respective trunk and feeder roads in concem. The environmental engineer&#13;
at SLRA should be responsible for preparation of specific mitigation plans for each road or road&#13;
section under the TSP. The mitigation plan for a certain road or road section should be based on&#13;
field inspections and available information from the LWDD. The plan should include:&#13;
e      a short descnrption of the proposed road project;&#13;
e      identification and description of the potential environmental impacts of the&#13;
proposed project, including potential impacts on landscape, nature, flora, fauna,&#13;
protected areas and species, soil erosion potential, rivers and groundwater,&#13;
resources demand and availability, air pollution and noise, land use and socio-&#13;
economic environment, occupational health and safety, and traffic safety,&#13;
*      proposals of project modifications or changes to reduce or eliminate negative&#13;
environmental impacts, and&#13;
*      a supervision plan for the construction works, including an action plan for the&#13;
constructors in case of unforeseen impacts dunrng the construction phase&#13;
An implementation schedule for the above proposed measures appears on page 8 of this Annex.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The development objectives of the
            Transport Sector Project are to: 1) support the
            implementation of the new transport sector policy and
            strategy; 2) expand the successful home-grown process of
            institutional reform and strengthening; and 3) increase the
            use of labor-intensive methods in road works and road
            maintenance. The specific project aims are: 1)
            sector/investment planning; 2) private participation; 3)
            regulatory capacity (management of road transport and
            alleviation of urban traffic congestion); 4) maritime
            transport; and 5) civil aviation safety. The project will
            consist of three main components: 1) capacity building; 2)
            parastatal restructuring and privatization; and 3) investment.
