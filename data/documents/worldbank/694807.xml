Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I. PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
1.    The overall aim of the Project is to support accelerated export-led growth in Madagascar, by&#13;
increasing private investment and productivity through reforms in the policy and business environment,&#13;
upgrading of private firms' capabilities and global market knowledge and involvement, and attracting&#13;
foreign direct investment (FDI).&#13;
2.    Due to almost two decades of public-sector led economic policies in the 1970s and 1980s,&#13;
Madagascar still needs to accomplish the transition to a modern market economy. Spurred by the&#13;
economic liberalization measures adopted in 1987-91, a small but dynamic export-oriented private sector&#13;
still comprising a "new breed" of entrepreneurs has emerged. Alongside this, the public sector and a&#13;
large public enterprise sector dominate many major economic activities. Meanwhile, market institutions,&#13;
including the rule of law, and a market culture based upon competition and transparency have yet to be&#13;
firmly established. Market- based business services responding to private firms' needs are extremely&#13;
limited. As a large island set apart from the African and Asian continents, Madagascar has remained for&#13;
a long time closed in upon itself, and the Malagasy private sector has little experience or knowledge of&#13;
world markets. Meanwhile, the Bank's operational experience has been that projects have been slowly&#13;
and poorly implemented, particularly where active upfront involvement by beneficiaries in project design&#13;
and preparation have been lacking.&#13;
3.    The Project has been designed and prepared taking the above factors into account, and learning&#13;
from past experiences in Madagascar and elsewhere: (a) considerable attention has been given to strong&#13;
and early preparation of each project component; (b) transparent and competitive market-based&#13;
approaches have been adopted not only for the policy reforms to be undertaken, but also for key&#13;
processes of project preparation and implementation - such as recruitment of key project personnel and&#13;
consultants; (c) emphasis has been given to client-led project preparation for each project component,&#13;
with active involvement of private sector stakeholders as well as government officials; (d) private sector&#13;
involvement has been based upon broad-based representation of the range of businesses by activity, size&#13;
and region.&#13;
4.    The philosophy underlying project design is based upon market principles and institutions: (1)&#13;
the privatization program is designed to be implemented in a transparent and competitive market-based&#13;
manner to ensure efficiency and sustainability in terms of popular support; (2) the market liberalization&#13;
and private sector incentives and tax administration reforms are aimed at removing distortions and&#13;
creating a level playing field for private investors, domestic and foreign, while recogniizing local&#13;
sensitivities and the need to ensure strong local participation; (3) the private sector capacity-building&#13;
components are all based upon catalytic and temporary programs to strengthen markets through private&#13;
firms' capabilities and market institutions, avoiding creation of new and permanent bureaucracies,&#13;
while opening up networks of market-based contacts between Malagasy private firms and foreign private&#13;
partners in world markets.&#13;
5.    The Project will contribute to the design and implementation of major reforms outlined in the&#13;
Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) - discussed by the Board in February 1997, and supported by&#13;
the IMF ESAF - approved in November 1996. However, its contribution is principally technical rather&#13;
than overtly policy-based. Alongside the immediate need to implement policy reforms under the CAS&#13;
and the ESAF, at least equal priority is being given to building long-term capabilities (people,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                   Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
institutions, infrastructure) and to supporting a debate on Madagascar's options for achieving accelerated&#13;
growth with equity in the longer run.&#13;
6.    The Government and the private sector's commitment to this approach are indicated by the&#13;
upfront actions already taken before project appraisal and Board presentation. Nevertheless, the Project&#13;
entails significant risks. It will require sustained political commitment to the Project objectives. Given&#13;
the innovative approaches both for the Bank and the Borrower, it will call for an intensive supervision&#13;
effort by Bank staff especially during the first year.&#13;
II. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
7.    The Project will support the design and implementation of two programs: economic policy&#13;
reforms and private sector capacity building.&#13;
Economic Policy Reform Program&#13;
Market Liberalization and Private Sector Incentives Reforms&#13;
8.    Removing impediments in the business environment to expanded and more efficient private&#13;
investment, including FDI, is key to generating a strong supply response as part of the Government's&#13;
adjustment program. Following the initial measures undertaken in 1996, supported by the SAC, over&#13;
1997-99, further reforms will be designed and adopted with technical support funded by the Project.&#13;
This will take the form of local and international expert assistance recruited by the Competitiveness&#13;
Review Committee (CRC), Technical Secretariat for Adjustment (STA), or the concerned Government&#13;
agency.&#13;
9.     The principal reform measures to be designed and adopted, in accordance with the 1996-98&#13;
Policy Framework Paper (PFP), prospectively identified for support are: (a) simplification of company&#13;
registration procedures; (b) removal of state and public enterprise monopolies and establishment of pro-&#13;
competitive regulatory frameworks, where needed, in major economic activities, notably sugar, wheat&#13;
flour, cotton ginning and marketing, raw meat, oil seeds, coastal shipping, ports, airports, water supply,&#13;
insurance; (c) mining sector liberalization, and mining code reform to encourage expanded private&#13;
investment and exports in a potentially major sector of the economy; (d) conclusion of double taxation&#13;
avoidance treaties with at least 20 FDI-source countries to encourage expanded foreign private&#13;
investment; (e) simplification and strengthening of "good" regulations (e.g., in forestry and fishing) to&#13;
support expanded, environmentally sound private investment and exports.&#13;
10.   A key focus of the incentives reforms will be measures to facilitate entry of foreign private&#13;
investors into the Malagasy market, to greatly expand the flows of FDI. These could include inter alia&#13;
further efforts - building upon the August 1996 land law reform - granting long-term leasehold access to&#13;
foreign investors - to improve foreign investor landholding rights. The Project would support analytical&#13;
studies and stakeholder workshops and seminars to facilitate a wider debate and fuller public&#13;
understanding of the issues involved.&#13;
11.   Measures designed under the Project would be presented to Cabinet, and where necessary to the&#13;
National Assembly, for approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project                   3&#13;
Public Enterprise Divestiture Program&#13;
12.    The Project will support preparation, implementation and performance monitoring of the&#13;
Government's renewed privatization program, by funding in part the preparation and execution of&#13;
divestiture transactions for individual Public Enterprises (PEs), design and adoption of pro-competitive&#13;
sector regulatory frameworks and demonopolization measures as needed, as well as the creation and&#13;
operation of key elements of the overall regulatory and institutional framework for privatization. The&#13;
latter are defined in the August 1996 Privatization Law. The framework takes account of significant&#13;
legal, regulatory and institutional problems encountered during the 1988-93 privatization program. It is&#13;
designed to ensure transparency and efficiency in preparation and execution of transactions, equity of&#13;
treatment between foreign and local investors, broad participation of local investors, small savers and the&#13;
general public, and widespread and effective public awareness of the aims, instruments, process and&#13;
progress of the program.&#13;
13.    Privatization Framework. Key features of the framework under the Privatization Law are: (a)&#13;
creation of a high-level Privatization Committee -comprising six members, two from the private sector -&#13;
and reporting directly to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet - responsible for oversight and direction of&#13;
the privatization program; (b) a small, lean Technical Secretariat to the Committee, to coordinate and&#13;
supervise implementation; (c) delegation of preparation and execution of divestiture transactions to&#13;
openly and competitively selected private investment advisers (consulting firms and investment banks);&#13;
(d) an arbitration commission to provide speedy and effective legal recourse for dispute resolution; (e) a&#13;
privatization trust fund to warehouse shares in privatized PEs for sale in blocks over time to local&#13;
investors; (f) a privatization social and regional development fund, as a proxy for a voucher scheme, to&#13;
enable broader popular participation in the divestiture program. A major public awareness campaign&#13;
will be mounted initially and throughout the program's implementation. At Credit negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that a public enterprise transfer tracking system (PETTS) will be created by June 1997 in the&#13;
Treasury in the Ministry of Decentralization and Budget to monitor progress in controlling and reducing&#13;
budget transfers to PEs.&#13;
14.    Early design and establishment of the above elements of the program have been supported by the&#13;
project through funding of local and international consultants under the Project Preparation Facilities&#13;
(PPFs). Following National Assembly approval and promulgation of the Privatization Law in August&#13;
1996, the Government's plan is that the key elements of the privatization framework will be legally&#13;
established by May 1997. This should permit the first transactions to be undertaken starting in the&#13;
second half of 1997.&#13;
15.    Process and Phasing of Divestitures.  Under the privatization program, preparation of&#13;
divestitures will be delegated (contracted out) separately (a) to independent private consultants for sector&#13;
regulatory design, enterprise audit and legal work, and (b) to private investment advisers for preparation&#13;
and execution of divestiture transactions. Liquidations would be handled separately from privatizations,&#13;
given the different skills involved and anticipated use of mainly local expertise. For privatizations, large&#13;
PEs would be handled by individually recruited investment advisers and consultants. Meanwhile, to&#13;
achieve cost saving, smaller and medium sized PEs would be handled in batches (of about 10 enterprises)&#13;
by individual investment advisers. Of 120 remaining commercial and industrial PEs, it is anticipated that&#13;
20 large ones would be handled individually for privatization and 80 handled in batches, while 20&#13;
expected liquidations would be handled in batches by local liquidators. While the goal is to complete&#13;
divestiture of all 120 PEs within 5-6 years, most contracts for handling divestitures would be let within&#13;
the first 25-30 months to allow some flexibility in timing completion of individual transactions in light of&#13;
market conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                   Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
16.   The remaining 120 PEs will be slated for divestiture in three phases of about 18-24 months each&#13;
over 1997-2002. A "long list" of PEs will be drawn up and approved by the Cabinet for each phase. At&#13;
least 10 large PEs would be included in Phases I and II. At Credit negotiations, it was agreed that the&#13;
Phase I list will include the following large PEs: Air Madagascar (airline); RNCFM (railways);&#13;
SECREN (shipbuilding and repair); SIRAMA (sugar production); SOLIMA (petroleum marketing and&#13;
distribution); ADEMA (airports management); HASYMA (cotton ginning and marketing); SINPA,&#13;
SOMACODIS and COROI (trading companies); and CMN (coastal shipping). In addition, about 35&#13;
smaller PEs would be included, including about five for possible liquidation.&#13;
17.    Selection of PEs for divestiture in Phase I is based upon the following objective criteria: (a)&#13;
maximizing private investment, output, productivity gains, and reduction in fiscal drain; (b) PEs in&#13;
sectors slated for early market liberalization under Government's economic reform program as&#13;
confirmed in the PFP; (c) lead-time needed to prepare and execute divestiture, especially for larger PEs;&#13;
(d) mobilizing sales revenues to finance subsequent phases of the divestiture program; and (e) creating a&#13;
positive market image of Madagascar's divestiture program vis-a-vis local and foreign private investors,&#13;
through sale of major PEs in relatively problem-free fashion.&#13;
18.   As agreed in the 1996-98 PFP, PEs representing 15% of the total PE sector in terms of aggregate&#13;
sales and employment would be divested in 1997, 20% in each of 1998-99, 25% in 2000, and 20% in&#13;
2001.&#13;
19.   Funding Divestiture Transactions and Use of Proceeds.  Proceeds from  divestiture&#13;
transactions would be allocated, in descending order or priority, to: (a) defraying divestiture transaction&#13;
costs; (b) allocation to servicing public debt; (c) funding the (reimbursable) trust fund for the&#13;
Privatization Social and Regional Development Fund (see below). The Project would provide funding&#13;
especially for preparation and execution of Phase I divestiture transactions (i.e., before any proceeds&#13;
have been realized) and for major transactions where costs could be lumpy and sizable. As far as&#13;
possible, however, transaction expenses would be met out of proceeds of earlier divestitures. For this&#13;
purpose, a revolving fund would be established lodged with the Treasury, in accordance with the&#13;
Privatization Law.&#13;
20.   Project Support. The Project would support the main elements of the privatization program and&#13;
the institutional framework:&#13;
Privatization Committee.  The project will support the setting up and operation of the&#13;
Privatization Committee which had received from the Government the mandate to implement the&#13;
privatization program. At Credit negotiations, the Government indicated that the composition of&#13;
the Committee would be restructured and reinforced by including additional qualified private&#13;
sector representatives. The project will also finance the setting up and the operation over a period&#13;
of five years of the Technical Secretariat which, under the authority of the Committee, will plan,&#13;
arrange, coordinate and supervise the work of the independent auditors, lawyers, economists and&#13;
financial advisors who will be hired to execute the individual divestiture transactions and, where&#13;
necessary, to prepare the individual sector reforms.&#13;
Preparation of Divestiture Transactions. The remuneration of the financial advisors funded in&#13;
part out of the IDA credit will in part be based on the proceeds from the sale of the shares in the&#13;
enterprises privatized. The project will finance part of the upfront audit, consulting and legal&#13;
costs of the independent advisors to the extent that they cannot be recouped from the proceeds of&#13;
the privatizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project             5&#13;
21.   Privatization Trust Fund (PTF). The project will finance the setting up of a share warehousing&#13;
scheme through the creation of a privately managed trust fund which will hold minority shares in the&#13;
privatized PEs pending their sale to company personnel, the Malagasy public and Malagasy enterprises&#13;
and institutional investors. Statutes establishing the PTF were approved by the Cabinet in September&#13;
1996, with technical modifications adopted in May 1997. Based upon technical preparation funded out&#13;
of the PPF, the PTF is expected to be established and to begin operations by end 1997 in time for the first&#13;
PE divestiture transactions. The PTF will be free to determine the PEs whose shares it will purchase&#13;
based upon a market analysis of their potential viability and market interest. The PTF will be permitted&#13;
to purchase up to 49 percent of a given PE's shares, but in practice will limit its holdings to around 30&#13;
percent, and will not exercise enterprise management responsibilities. The management of the fund will&#13;
be delegated to a private manager selected after competitive bidding who will receive the mandate from&#13;
the Government to manage the fund and to liquidate it over a period of five-seven years through sales to&#13;
the authorized buyers mentioned above in accordance with a management contract. The objectives as set&#13;
forth in the management contract will be to: (a) preserve and enhance the value of the shares held, (b)&#13;
maximize the capital gain on the sale of the shares sold to enterprises and institutional investors; and (c)&#13;
liquidate the share portfolio in accordance with a set time plan. The Project will finance the up-front&#13;
costs of setting up the privatization trust fund and the initial fixed part of the management fees to be paid&#13;
to the private manager of the fund.&#13;
22.   Privatization Social and Regional Development Fund (PSRDF). Broad public participation in&#13;
privatization programs is desirable to lend transparency and ensure popular support. However, in&#13;
practice, in African economies, voucher schemes along East European lines are virtually impossible to&#13;
undertake administratively. The aim of the PSRDF is to enable wide, mass involvement - albeit&#13;
indirectly - in the privatization program for less privileged groups in society, notably the rural and urban&#13;
poor, retrenched PE employees, and unemployed graduates. The PSRDF will be funded with a (modest)&#13;
share of net PE privatization proceeds, and will provide limited amounts of credit, training and outreach&#13;
assistance to support grass-roots level self-employment projects, channeled through effective NGO-&#13;
based and private schemes (such as AGETIPA, FID, etc.). Statutes establishing the PSRDF were&#13;
approved by the Cabinet in September 1996, with technical modifications adopted in May 1997. A&#13;
portion of the proceeds from the sale of the shares to private shareholders will be transferred to a fund to&#13;
be managed and supervised by the management and the board of directors of the FID (Fonds&#13;
d'intervention pour le Developpement), a private non-profit association created with the support of IDA&#13;
(under the Food Security &amp; Nutrition II Project) in 1993 to finance basic infrastructure and employment-&#13;
generating projects at the local community level.  To avoid unnecessary overhead, no separate&#13;
management team will be set up to manage the privatization social fund. However, it will have complete&#13;
financial autonomy from the FID to ensure transparency and facilitate the monitoring of project&#13;
implementation. The objective of the PSRDF is to ensure that all constituencies of the Malagasy&#13;
population may receive tangible benefits from the divestiture of PEs. The proposed project will finance&#13;
the costs of setting up and initial operation of the PSRDF.&#13;
23.   Arbitration Commission. The objective of the Arbitration Commission is to facilitate a faster,&#13;
more cost effective and pragmatic resolution than under the (still weak) formal judiciary system of legal&#13;
disputes arising from the implementation of the privatization program. The project would finance the&#13;
cost of setting up the commission.&#13;
24.   Public Awareness Campaign. The Project will finance a public awareness campaign which&#13;
will have as objectives to: (a) ensure public support by making Malagasy stakeholders aware of the need&#13;
and advantages of the program privatization; (b) ensure transparency of the program through wide&#13;
dissemination of the rules; (c) both abroad and within the country, announce and explain the PE&#13;

Divestiture Program in context of the structural changes necessary to improve the economic and business&#13;
environment and enhance the economic competitiveness of the country. The project will finance&#13;
technical assistance to plan, prepare, implement and monitor the results of the public awareness&#13;
campaign. The public awareness campaign will be contracted out as a whole or in segments to specialist&#13;
communications consultants.&#13;
25.    Public Enterprise Transfer Tracking System (PETTS). The Ministry of Decentralization and&#13;
Budget (MB) will establish a data system for tracking fiscal transfers to PEs (both direct in terms of&#13;
budget support, and indirect in terms of taxes and debt service foregone) to be operated by the public&#13;
enterprise monitoring unit in the Treasury. The PETTS will be the key means of monitoring progress of&#13;
the PE divestiture program against a major goal of reducing and eliminating fiscal drain. It is needed&#13;
because until now MB has had no integrated overall system for monitoring and controlling fiscal&#13;
transfers to and from PEs in their various forms. It was agreed at Credit negotiations that the PETTS will&#13;
be set up by end June 1997.&#13;
26.    PE Employee Retraining Fund. In order to address work force changes, including potential&#13;
layoffs that may occur during implementation of the PE divestiture program, a redeployment and&#13;
retraining scheme is being prepared and will be adopted by the Government early on. Initial estimates are&#13;
that, in Phase I of the divestiture program, about 7,000 out of a total work force of 30,000 in the&#13;
concerned PEs could be retrenched and could need retraining assistance. The Retraining Fund would&#13;
provide, where needed, redeployment and training assistance to enable retrenched PE employees to make&#13;
the transition to new jobs. It will be based upon the following principles: (a) it will focus upon&#13;
enterprise-specific needs rather than a generalized approach; (b) through retraining for redeployment, it&#13;
will complement, as needed, legally due government-funded severance pay to laid-off workers; (c) it will&#13;
aim at sustained increases in worker productivity and household incomes; (d) it will give priority to&#13;
regions and sectors where immediate re-employment possibilities are limited; (e) it will work largely&#13;
through existing programs and institutional mechanisms, including several successful PVOlNGO-based&#13;
schemes as well as private placement services. Overall program coordination and management will be&#13;
done by a small autonomous redeployment and retraining unit (RRU) with a lean and well qualified staff&#13;
reporting to the MDSPP. The RRU will coordinate initial retraining activities, while preparing a broader&#13;
redeployment program for the medium-term. The institutional and operating arrangements for the&#13;
Retraining Fund are expected to be in place by September 1997.&#13;
Tax administration reform&#13;
27.    Madagascar's poor and declining tax performance is due to several factors: (a) excessive&#13;
revenue dependence upon external trade taxes, resulting in revenue losses as they have been reduced and&#13;
not replaced by effective non-protective indirect taxes; (b) a culture of pervasive ad hoc, discretionary&#13;
exemptions since 1990 eroding taxpayer compliance; (c) a structurally limited tax base due to the high&#13;
level of subsistence activities in the economy and a large non-performing (thus non-taxpaying) public&#13;
enterprise sector; (d) an antiquated and neglected system of tax and customs administration with&#13;
inadequate and declining staffing, material resources, and organization; (e) weak and outdated systems&#13;
for most major taxes, including corporate, property, as well as indirect taxation. The poorly conceived&#13;
indirect tax reforms of 1993, coupled with new ad hoc exemptions, further weakened tax administration&#13;
and tax payer compliance. While comprehensive tax reform is thus needed, it cannot be undertaken all at&#13;
once, given generally limited implementation capacity and the fundamental weaknesses in tax&#13;
administration, which will further deteriorate greatly over the next few years if not addressed now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project                   7&#13;
28.    The strategy adopted by the Government, whose implementation will be supported by the&#13;
Project, is to focus selectively on addressing key weaknesses in the tax system, giving priority to&#13;
overhauling tax administration. The main problems to be addressed are:&#13;
*   Value Added Tax (VAT): Introduced in 1994, the VAT comprises a long list of exemptions&#13;
iilnerited from the previous transaction tax and sales tax systems, on items normally subject&#13;
to tax (notably services). The zero rate regime, which should be applied only to exports, is&#13;
used to grant ad hoc exemptions. No turnover threshold exists below which the VAT is&#13;
simplified for small entrepreneurs by applying a flat tax, while the tax administrationl, whichi&#13;
has a weak computerized information system, is unable to track and inspect all firms subject&#13;
to VAT.&#13;
*   Weaknesses of the fiscal administration: Tax administration organization is antiquated,&#13;
cumbersome and complex, and is a key reason for poor tax collection. It is based on&#13;
principles dating from before Independence: two separate directorates are responsible for&#13;
revenue collection (Tax Directorate) and tax payer control (Public Accounting Directorate)&#13;
creating many overlaps. Furthermore, the Tax Directorate is broken-down into three UllitS --&#13;
direct taxes; indirect taxes and registration taxes -- with little coordination between them.&#13;
Coordination with customs is weak, and no single taxpayer identification number system&#13;
exists. Staffing levels are inadequate, and will decline much further in the next four years&#13;
wheni one third of the tax (and customs) inspectors will retire.&#13;
X   Weaknesses of the customs administration: The customs administration does not effectively&#13;
monitor and check imports (notably in terms of value of goods) and its inspection of free-&#13;
zone regime imports is inadequate. The customs information system installed is under-&#13;
utilized compared with its capabilities. Finally, procedures are cumbersome and comprise&#13;
too many, often ineffective, controls.&#13;
The Project component objectives are, in the first phase (18-24 months): (a) VAT system modernizationi:&#13;
(b) rehabilitation of tax administration; and (c) strengthening of the customs administration, and in the&#13;
second phase: (d) simplification and improvements in taxation of small firms; and (e) selected&#13;
improvements in corporate taxation.&#13;
29.    Modernization of the VAT system. The system is rather simple being based upon a single (20&#13;
per cent) rate. To improve the efficiency of the tax administration, and widen the base upon whichi the&#13;
VAT is applied, a threshold above which all enterprises will be subjected to VAT, regardless of their&#13;
sectors of intervention and of their activities, needs to be introduced, and the list of goods zero-rated or&#13;
exempted needs to be substantially curtailed. Collection needs to be improved substantially throughi&#13;
better organization (especially in monitoring and inspecting large firms), increased taxpayer education&#13;
and outreach, and simplification of procedures. A pilot unit dealing only with larger enterprise taxpayers&#13;
will be created, and a single identification number system will be introduced. Finally, training will be&#13;
provided to the tax and customs administrations and enterprises will be informed of the new rules. The&#13;
rate level could theni be reviewed - and perhaps slightly lowered - if improved collections on a broader&#13;
base can be achieved.&#13;
30.    Rehabilitation of the fiscal administration.  This rehabilitation will be conducted in two&#13;
phases. Duriiig the first phase --1996/97-- a pilot unit ("centre fiscal pilote des entreprises", CFPE) will&#13;
be created in Antananarivo, responsible for tax assessment of and revenue collection from the 60 largest&#13;
enterprises, which account for 55 percent of the corporate tax and 45 percent of the VAT. The CFPE&#13;
will use modern collection procedures supported by a computerized information system and will aim at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                    Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
tax administration performance improvement and simplification of declaration forms. It is expected that&#13;
its creation will dramatically improve the overall revenue collection performance of the tax&#13;
administration.&#13;
31.    During the second phase --1998/99-- the other departments of the Tax Directorate will be&#13;
progressively reorganized. First, other CFPEs will be created, starting with the main provincial centers.&#13;
Second, three or four Tax Centers will be created in Antanainarivo to set up a mode of taxation and a&#13;
fiscal administration adapted to small taxpayers and entrepreneurs which are not dealt with by CFPEs.&#13;
To complete the reform, other Tax Centers will be created around the country.&#13;
32.   In parallel with the implementation of these two phases, the following actions will be taken:&#13;
*   the tax administration will be effectively computerized, starting with the CFPE;&#13;
*   an auditing program will be designed by the Tax Directorate with specific targets assigned&#13;
to each division;&#13;
*   the two auditing squads will be merged giving priority to monitoring enterprises benefiting&#13;
from tax exemptions (under the Investment Code and EPZ regimes);&#13;
*   a major tax and customs inspector recruitment program will be uindertaken, to strengtheni the&#13;
tax service through replacement of retiring officers with well-educated new recruits;&#13;
*   a training program will be designed, which will comprise the initial training for newly&#13;
recruited staff as well as the skill upgrading of the existing staff.&#13;
33.    Customs Administration Strengthening. The following measures will be taken to strengtlhen&#13;
the customs administration:&#13;
*   Up-date of the customs software in the two main customs offices (Antananarivo and&#13;
Toamasina) with implementation of all the available features. Once this is in place, the&#13;
computerization will be progressively extended to the other main offices.&#13;
*   Creation of a new office in Antananarivo to more effectively monitor all the free-zone&#13;
enterprise operations.&#13;
*   Setting-up of a new organization both at the national and regional levels to ensure a good&#13;
monitoring of operations.&#13;
*   Recruitment of new staff and, in coordination with the tax administration, tralining of the&#13;
customs staff aimnig at reinforcing inter-departmental collaboration.&#13;
34.    Project Implementation. To facilitate component implementation, a project group composed of&#13;
two teams - a tax team and a customs team - was created in September 1996 within the General&#13;
Directorate of Fiscal Resources (DGRF). The core of the CFPE staff is also part of the tax team which&#13;
also comprises specialists in information systems and in VAT systems, initially assisted for a year by an&#13;
internationally recruited tax administration expert. The customs team (to be set up later in 1997) will be&#13;
composed of three high-level staff from the customs administration, and a specialist in the customs&#13;
information system software, initially assisted for a year by an internationally recruited customs expert.&#13;
35.    The tax team was created in September 1996, supported by an internationally recruited tax&#13;
administrationi specialist seconded by the IMF. The team drew up and implemented over October 1996-&#13;
March 1997 an initial program to revamp tax administration and design the VAT reform along the lines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project                   9&#13;
outlined in paras. 28-31 above. Initial urgent equipment and computerization needs were financed out of&#13;
the PPF to help ensure effective early start-up of the tax reform program. Major changes in the tax&#13;
administration were adopted in the 1997 Budget Law, including the introduction of a 3-5% advance&#13;
payment of income taxes levied on importers against the cost of imported goods. The CFPE in&#13;
Antananarivo was established and all domestic tax collection from  larger firms above a given VAT&#13;
threshold transferred to it from  March 1997. The CFPE has adopted streamlined and simplified&#13;
collection procedures for taxpayers working with it. Initial indications are that revenue collection&#13;
performance has significantly improved as a result. Meanwhile, the Government has prepared the&#13;
revamped VAT system which will be adopted as part of a revised budget law to be presented to the&#13;
National Assembly for approval before August 1997. During Credit negotiations, it was agreed that: (a)&#13;
an improved system of incentives bonuses linked to tax collections will be adopted for staff of the CFPE&#13;
as well as of the tax and customs departments as part of the revised budget law for 1997; and (b)&#13;
operating budgets adequate to achieve improved revenue collection targets would be allocated to the&#13;
CFPE and the tax and customs departments in 1997-2002.&#13;
36.    The Project will finance: (a) equipment, including computers and computer software, for both&#13;
Tax and Customs Departments; (b) services of internationally recruited long-term tax administration and&#13;
customs experts; (c) short-term specialist consultanits to assist in specific aspects of the program,&#13;
including VAT and informations systems design; and (d) training for tax and customs officials.&#13;
Private Sector Capacity Building Program&#13;
37.    Madagascar's formal private sector remains limited in scope and size, with monopolies or&#13;
oligopolies in many sectors, and is highly concentrated regionally (in and around the capital&#13;
Antananarivo). Until recently, most of the formal indigenous private sector consisted of firms involved&#13;
in import-substitution and traditional trade. With the contraction of the domestic market and the decline&#13;
in volume and prices of the traditional exports (vanilla, cloves, coffee) and their poor long-term outlook,&#13;
these firms are faced with the need to fundamentally restructure themselves. Due to decades of being&#13;
isolated from world markets and sources of foreign investment, much of Madagascar's private sector&#13;
conitinues to be handicapped by inadequate market knowledge, technological information and skills, as&#13;
well as management and internal capacity constraints.&#13;
38.    Recent Bank studies  measure the effect that this type of isolation has on the technical and&#13;
management capabilities of firms. Using firm-level data collected in Ghana, Kenya and Zimbabwe over&#13;
a three-year period, one study finds that althiough each of these economies is undergoing extensive&#13;
structural reform programs, the overall technological capabilities and firm-level efficiencies remain low&#13;
in these countries relative to the rest of the world. Both studies identify the weak or non-existent&#13;
connections with such international sources of technology transfer as techniical experts, buyers and&#13;
suppliers as a major contributing factor and conclude that a broad range of individual and collective&#13;
expert support services is required to accelerate the supply response to structural reforms. They also&#13;
illustrate how foreign direct investors can contribute to a rapid improvement in technological capabilities&#13;
through joint venture and sub-contracting arrangements with local partners.&#13;
39.    Demand Study. In a March 1996 demand study, 298 companies throughout Madagascar were&#13;
surveyed on their potential demand for expert support services. Covering all major industrial sectors as&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                   Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
well as tourism, transport and artisanry, these companies range in size from  small artisans to&#13;
manufacturers employing close to 1000 people. Of these companies, 180 are located in the capital city&#13;
region, with the other 109 in I I other regions of the country. The vast majority of these firms expressed&#13;
an unmet need for some form of expert assistance; together they formulated a total of 328 specific needs&#13;
for support services including firm-level technical assistance in marketing, product development and&#13;
manufacturing management; feasibility and market studies; on-site training of manufacturing and&#13;
maintenance personnel; computer training and information sessions on new technologies and quality&#13;
norms and standards.&#13;
40.    More than two thirds of the firms surveyed expressed a willingness to contribute to the costs of&#13;
the services if this would give them access to higih quality expertise. Only a small portion of the firms&#13;
had received expert assistance so far, most firms acknowledging that a perceived lack of locally available&#13;
expertise had kept them from seeking outside assistance.&#13;
41.    The same study assessed the capacity of local consulting firms to provide support services. A&#13;
total of 95 firms and their portfolios were surveyed and the study found that between 50 and 70 percent&#13;
of their market traditionally has been financed by donors. The study found that local capacity was&#13;
available in general mianagement related fields but practically absent in more technically oriented areas.&#13;
Siginificantly, only 4 percent of the assignments analyzed had been performed by a local-foreign&#13;
partnership. These results confirm the findings of several previous studies (including the 1988 ILO labor&#13;
skills assessment, and the 1995 Bank Private Sector Assessment) indicating a wide range of technical&#13;
and business skills shortages, as well as shortages of experienced technicians and skilled workers in&#13;
many industrial and service fields, including tourism, mininig, agri-business, and information services.&#13;
Private Sector Fund (PSF)&#13;
42.    The project would provide partial funding (on a limited time, matchinlg grant basis) for a broad&#13;
range of expert support services to Malagasy small and medium  firms and business associations to&#13;
encourage productivity improvements. The PSF would not directly provide technical services to the&#13;
private sector but would act as a catalyst and intermediary between firms and associations of the private&#13;
sector that need assistance, and local and international suppliers of business services. It will finance&#13;
improved access to private support services (management, marketing, information and technical experts&#13;
and consulting firms) provided wherever possible by local providers to strengthen the local market for&#13;
such services, but also importantly by international private providers where needed.&#13;
43.    The PSF would also fund (on a similar basis) development of information, advisory and support&#13;
services by well-established private sector associations and groups of firms to their members.&#13;
44.    This component would be managed by a private, non-profit company ("association privee a but&#13;
non-lucratif'). Its general manager has been recruited from the private sector through an international&#13;
and competitive process. A Malagasy national, he has spent the last three years in the international&#13;
financial sector with IFC's APDF in Ghana, before which he managed the venture capital company in&#13;
Madagascar - Fiaro.&#13;
45.    The PSF operations are governed by a detailed procedures manual. This manual specifies the&#13;
following eligibility criteria for PSF's assistance. Eligible for support by the FASP would be wholly&#13;
private sector owned enterprises, groups of enterprises and business associations. To be eligible for&#13;
matching grant finanicing, the business or business association would have to specify how the proposed&#13;
support service would improve its productivity or that of its membership. Specific support services that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project              11&#13;
would be eligible for matching grant financing would include expert assistance and training programs in&#13;
product development and quality improvement, installation of new technology and manufacturing&#13;
methods, market research and prospecting trips abroad, visits by strategic buyers to Madagascar, and&#13;
creation of business networks and joint ventures. Specifically excluded from FASP support would be the&#13;
financing of equipment and regular operating expenses.&#13;
46.    The procedures manual will include transparent and competitive procedures for hiring&#13;
consultants and supervising and evaluating the services that they would provide. It will also specify the&#13;
cost sharing formula that will be applied. This formula will be designed to (a) not exclude small&#13;
enterprises from the support of PSF; and (b) ensure that entrepreneurs "graduate" over time and accept to&#13;
bear the cost of expert services that they need. It will be designed along the following lines: The amount&#13;
of the matching grant would be calculated based on the total cumulative cost of all the support services&#13;
received by a single beneficiary firm and partially subsidized by FASP during the life of the project,&#13;
according to the following formula:&#13;
Total Cumulative Cost              Beneficiary                 % Matching&#13;
of Support Services (US$)          Contribution                Grant&#13;
0      -             6,500           20%                          80%&#13;
6,501         -      20,000          35%                         65%&#13;
20,001        -      50,000          50%                         50%&#13;
Over 50,000                          70%                         30%&#13;
47.    The total amount of matching grants per beneficiary firm would be capped at US$50,000. This&#13;
formula would allow smaller firms to gain access to high quality support services while at the same time&#13;
providing a strong incentive for larger firms, whose needs for expert support are likely to be more&#13;
substantial, to participate.&#13;
48.    Experience with matching grant schemes elsewhere (Kenya, Mauritius, India) indicates that the&#13;
average grant size will remain well below the maximum amount and is likely to amount to approximately&#13;
US$15,000 per firm over the 3-year life of the project.&#13;
49.    The PSF will establish and maintain a roster of approved technical experts, consultants and&#13;
consulting firms both domestic and foreign. This roster will be classified by category of service and&#13;
updated regularly to include new consultants or exclude unsatisfactory ones. To be eligible for PSF&#13;
support, beneficiaries will select or invite consultants to bid on the basis of a short list generally but not&#13;
exclusively drawn from this roster. The PSF will conduct an extensive public awareness campaign&#13;
nationwide to inform the business community of its services and raise awareness among private&#13;
entrepreneurs that benefits from expert support services can outweigh their costs.&#13;
50.    To adequately design the functioning of the PSF, a survey has been carried out to assess the&#13;
demand within the private sector for and supply of expert support services. In addition, a study has been&#13;
commissioned with a local consulting firm to develop the legal and organizational framework and&#13;
accounting system for the PSF and a detailed procedures manual. Based oii the two studies, the corporate&#13;
legal statutes and organizational and financial set-up were drawn up and discussed with IDA during&#13;
Project appraisal, and will be finalized and adopted by the Borrower before Credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                   Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
51.    The procedures manual includes detailed step-by-step descriptions of such procedures as: (a)&#13;
criteria for selection of beneficiaries; (b) how to develop and maintain a roster of expertise and support&#13;
service providers; (c) how to assist the beneficiary in selecting a service provider; (d) the cost sharing&#13;
formula to be applied; and (e) how to monitor and evaluate the service assignment. The manual includes&#13;
sample documents for application to the fund, procurement of the service provider, the contract to be&#13;
used between the beneficiary and the service provider, and evaluation formats.&#13;
52.    During project appraisal, a project implementation planning workshop was held with&#13;
representative private sector beneficiaries and stakeholders to: (a) reach a consensus on the objectives of&#13;
the PSF; (b) formulate a work program for the initial period; and (c) define key performance indicators&#13;
and evaluation criteria.&#13;
53.    Under this component, IDA funds in the amount of US$4.5 million equivalent will be made&#13;
available as a grant by the Government to the FASP. They will also finance, on a cost-sharing basis,&#13;
consultancy, technical assistance and training services for eligible enterprises and business associations&#13;
of the private sector. These funds will finance over a period of three years salaries of a small&#13;
professional staff, office equipment and operating expenses of the FASP in addition to a public&#13;
awareness campaign.&#13;
54.    The FASP will maximize synergies with other donor-funded and private support service and&#13;
outreach programs to ensure its cost-effectiveness. During project preparation it was determined from&#13;
discussions with other multi-lateral and bilateral aid donors active in this area, that the FASP would be&#13;
strongly complementary to their efforts (which are more often based either upon direct service provision&#13;
by long-term expatriate advisers and/or assistance to arrange bank credit for project finance). In several&#13;
instances, most notably the European Union-funded PRIDE program, which is to fund support to private&#13;
firms in the four Indian Ocean Commission countries to encourage inter-regional trade, strategic&#13;
alliances are being worked out to coordinate activities and develop a pool of common, jointly funded&#13;
services. An operational service agreement ("protocole d'accord") may also be concluded to this effect&#13;
between the FASP and PRIDE, based upon the conclusions of a joint EU-Bank mission in May 1996.&#13;
55.    Electronic Commerce for Information and Market Access.  Due to weaknesses in&#13;
Madagascar's telecommunications infrastructure (one of the least developed in Africa), and its isolation&#13;
from world markets, Malagasy private entrepreneurs have little access to or experience of international&#13;
markets and the range of information services currently available. Only one or two Internet Service&#13;
Providers (ISPs) are established in Madagascar on a very small scale, serving only limited academic and&#13;
business needs. Establishment of more widely available electronic commerce (including Internet)&#13;
services to private business could greatly enhance the productivity and competitiveness of Malagasy&#13;
private firms at very low cost. The Electronic Commerce (including Internet) systems could inter alia:&#13;
(a) provide access to data bases and information services available internationally in a range of technical&#13;
and business-related fields; (b) connect Malagasy private firms with potential suppliers and business&#13;
partners abroad; (c) inter-connect private firms across different regions of Madagascar and create new&#13;
markets and business opportunities by improving information of demand and prices; (d) improve&#13;
nationwide access to locally available business support services; (e) greatly reduce communications and&#13;
data-transmission costs locally and internationally (compared with fax and other far more costly&#13;
services); and (f) create a strong private sector constituency for communications sector liberalization and&#13;
reform. The FASP will not substitute for current and potential new ISPs in terms of hardware and&#13;
software services. Rather it will act as a catalysi to enhance private sector awareness of potential&#13;
commercial uses of Internet services, to use the Internet to enhance its own services, and to enable small&#13;
firms (initially unable to purchase their own equipment) to have access to the Worldwide Web and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project           13&#13;
national network on a retail, fee-for-service basis. The FASP will encourage and support existing and&#13;
new ISPs in Madagascar to provide services to Malagasy private firms.&#13;
56.   Specifically, the Project will support:  (a) private sector awareness building seminars to&#13;
disseminate information about available electronic commerce services (including via the Internet); (b)&#13;
development and adaptation of existing and new ISPs to better serve private sector needs in terms of&#13;
software, equipment and information services; (c) interconnection of FASP via the Internet with a&#13;
network of available international business information services to enhance its own expertise roster and&#13;
data base; (d) establishment of fee-based access to these Internet services for Malagasy private firms; and&#13;
(e) definition, as needed, of a legal and regulatory framework in Madagascar for electronic document&#13;
transmission and business transactions.  The Project would fund, as needed, training, local and&#13;
international expert services, limited equipment upgrading and software matching grants, and creation of&#13;
a dedicated private network for FASP. The Project will undertake these activities in close coordination&#13;
with the Infonet system being developed by the Indian Ocean Commission in connection with the PRIDE&#13;
program to avoid duplication and ensure maximum synergies between the two.&#13;
Improved Government/Private Sector Dialogue - Competitiveness Review Committee (CRC)&#13;
57.   The project would support the activities of the CRC, created in September 1995. Since then, the&#13;
provisional organization of the CRC has already been very active in contributing to the design of the&#13;
Government's adjustment program, most notably in preparation of the private sector incentives reforms&#13;
adopted by the Cabinet in May 1996. In December 1995, it appointed as a full-time Coordinator a&#13;
Malagasy professional with strong experience in both private sector and govemment. The CRC has&#13;
already created a network of active regional chapters in nine regions throughout Madagascar, and, with&#13;
their help and with a consultant, has undertaken a preliminary stock-taking of key bottlenecks facing&#13;
private sector operations. Since formal establishment in September 1996, the CRC has begun to work as&#13;
an independent advisory body with a mandate to: (a) identify and analyze policy and other business&#13;
environment constraints to private sector competitiveness; (b) develop detailed proposals for policy&#13;
change; and (c) submit these proposals for consideration by the highest levels of Government through the&#13;
Prime Minister's Office.&#13;
58.   The CRC is composed of knowledgeable senior government officials from key agencies&#13;
(participating in an individual expert capacity) and business people representing the various sectors,&#13;
business sizes and regions of the country, participating on a voluntary basis. An experienced local&#13;
consultant was recruited to advise on the formal organizational set-up for the CRC, the most appropriate&#13;
form of leadership and how to organize its relationship with the Government, recognizing that the CRC&#13;
needs to retain its independence but at the same time needs to enjoy strong commitment from and access&#13;
to the higher levels of the Government to be effective. On this basis, the CRC was established as a&#13;
private non-profit association ("association priv6e a but non-lucratif') in which private sector and&#13;
government representatives are members on an equal footing. In addition, a convention ("protocole&#13;
d'accord") was concluded (in October 1996) between the Govemment and the CRC recognizing its status&#13;
as a prime interlocutor between the Government and the private sector on competitiveness policy issues,&#13;
and formally committing the Government to take into account the CRC's recommendations for change.&#13;
59.   In October 1996, the CRC members elected a strong and influential private sector President, with&#13;
a reputation for integrity and credibility with both the public and private sectors, who would serve on a&#13;
"pro bono" basis elected by the members of the CRC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                   Madagascar. Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
60.     During project appraisal, the members of the CRC conducted a project planning workshop to:&#13;
(a) reach a consensus on the priority themes for the policy dialogue during its first year; (b) prepare and&#13;
agree upon a detailed work program; and (c) develop an implementation plan and criteria for evaluation&#13;
of results.&#13;
61.    The CRC will be responsible for analyzing specific areas of the business environment. The CRC&#13;
will:  (a) elicit from  participants different perspectives on competitiveness issues; (b) commission&#13;
experts, when necessary, to conduct diagnostic studies and formulate alternative policy options; and (c)&#13;
invite individuals with appropriate expertise from Madagascar and abroad to present their experiences.&#13;
The general assembly will review their proposals, reach a consensus on recommendations and submit&#13;
these to the Government. The CRC will gather and provide members with relevant information and, as&#13;
necessary, contract experts to carry out studies to support the deliberations.&#13;
62.    The CRC will conduct a continuing public awareness campaign to disseminate its findings and&#13;
conclusions on reforms needed in the business environment for the development of the private sector.&#13;
63.    The Project will finance, over a period of three years: (1) salaries of CRC's  professional&#13;
Coordinator, a small support staff, supplies and other operating expenses; (2) consultants' services to&#13;
carry out policy diagnostic studies; (3) the public awareness campaign; and (4) international expert visits&#13;
to disseminate lessons learned and best practices from elsewhere.&#13;
Private Sector Seminars Program&#13;
64.    Due to weak communications and media, there is a major lack of up-to-date information and&#13;
knowledge in Madagascar on international trends in markets and technologies, and on policy and other&#13;
factors contributing to poor local economic performance. Improving public and especially private sector&#13;
awareness through wide dissemination of these and encouraging debate among different economic&#13;
groups nationally and regionally would help open up Madagascar's economy to world markets,&#13;
contribute to capacity building in the private sector, and build consensus for policy reform. Since late&#13;
1994, with support from the Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI), a program of seminars,&#13;
organized and sponsored by Malagasy private sector voluntary groups, on major national economic&#13;
policy issues (anti- competitive practices in December 1994, export strategies in July 1995), have&#13;
successfully sparked national debate, generated consensus on actions needed, and improved knowledge&#13;
and awareness.&#13;
65.    The project would expand this effort by funding a three-year program  of seminars on&#13;
competitiveness issues involving a representative cross-section of public and private sector participants,&#13;
as well as representatives of Parliament, NGOs and the labor unions. (See Attachment 3 for details.)&#13;
These seminars will be locally held in Antananarivo and other regional centers across Madagascar. They&#13;
will serve as fora where private sector stakeholders and policy makers jointly identify and find practical&#13;
solutions to public policy impediments to private sector activities, or, alternatively, are exposed to&#13;
international market developments, trends, and approaches and technologies, management and marketing&#13;
techniques relating to important export and other activities for Madagascar. The seminars' conclusions&#13;
will serve as inputs for the CRC and for the FASP. Study tours would be organized on a selective basis&#13;
to expose Malagasy private sector and other participants to good practices abroad, both in policy reform,&#13;
technology developments and firm upgrading.&#13;
66.    The project will finance the preparation and conduct of at least three seminars, and one study&#13;
tour, each year. The seminars will be demand-driven, and highly participatory - focusing on topics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project                15&#13;
identified by the private sector stakeholders, and prepared and organized by local organizations in the&#13;
private sector, NGOs, and in government. The FASP will manage and administer a Seminars Fund for&#13;
financing the seminars program, with support from EDI to help ensure good pedagogy and exposure to&#13;
other countries' experiences through international resource persons. Eligible organizations will apply to&#13;
the Seminars Fund for partial financing to prepare and organize seminars on topics of broader national&#13;
interest in terms of private sector competitiveness, and would need to demonstrate they have the capacity&#13;
to do so and have identified an audience. Seminars would be at least partially self-financing from&#13;
registration fees, and sponsoring organizations'contributions. On a half-yearly basis, the Seminars Fund&#13;
would invite applications from local organizations, including the CRC. A tri-partite selection committee&#13;
comprising the Presidents of the CRC and STA, and the General Manager of the PSF will adjudicate&#13;
applications and award seminar grants.&#13;
FDI Match-Making Scheme&#13;
67.    The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Match-making Scheme will act as a catalyst for private&#13;
sector, market-based promotion of increased FDI inflows to Madagascar. It will address information&#13;
imperfections (about business potential in Madagascar) in prospective FDI supplying countries (in East&#13;
Asia, Europe, the Americas), by giving incentives to private intermediaries to use their existing&#13;
information networks to bring together local and foreign firms in collaboration arrangements. The&#13;
Scheme is patterned after similar successful endeavors in other African and East European transitional&#13;
economies, and is based upon a model developed by the Bank's Private Sector Development Department.&#13;
68.    Results of 'pilot" Program. To test the approach, a "pilot" FDI match-making program was&#13;
conducted over December 1995-July 1996, by a team of three foreign and three local private investment&#13;
brokers, with the support of Bank staff, and under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Industries and&#13;
Artisanry (MIA). The "pilot" scheme focused upon encouraging collaboration agreements between&#13;
private firms in Madagascar and in four East Asian countries - Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Japan.&#13;
The three local private investment brokers were recruited by open, competitive selection from the&#13;
Malagasy private sector by a committee of private sector representatives.&#13;
69.    The investment brokers team pre-identified over 100 Malagasy firms interested and capable of&#13;
entering into collaboration with foreign partner firms, and, on visits to the four East Asian countries,&#13;
accompanied by a senior MIA official, they pre-identified about 60 small-medium Asian private firms&#13;
seriously interested in considering investing in Madagascar, and who were a sectoral match for the local&#13;
firms. The Asiaii entrepreneurs were invited to visit Madagascar to prospect for partners and also to give&#13;
feedback directly to the private sector and government officials about the Malagasy business&#13;
environment and improvements needed.&#13;
70.    Under the "pilot" scheme, some 60 East Asian entrepreneurs visited Madagascar over April-July,&#13;
with logistical assistance and support from the investment brokers' team. As noted in the MOP para.3 1,&#13;
the "pilot" has confirmed in a number of important respects the potential for setting up a fully fledged&#13;
FDI Match-making Scheme along market lines. Specifically, it succeeded in: (a) attracting foreign&#13;
entrepreneurs to visit Madagascar by better informing them of opportunities; (b) generating foreign-local&#13;
partnerships where they would otherwise not have occurred;  (c) improving Malagasy private&#13;
entrepreneurs' exposure to foreign investors; (d) building a small pool of Malagasy, and also foreign,&#13;
private investment brokers to undertake such promotion activities in future; (e) obtaining valuable direct&#13;
feedback on improvements needed in Madagascar's business environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                  Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
71.   FDI Match-Making Scheme. Based upon the positive results of the "pilot", it was decided to&#13;
include an FDI Match-making Scheme in the Project. Under this component, funding will be made&#13;
available to facilitate export-oriented collaboration between Malagasy private firms and small and&#13;
medium private businesses in developed and high-perfornance developing economies. Promoting&#13;
export-oriented FDI and joint ventures is a key ultimate goal. However, as an initial step, the Scheme&#13;
will focus mainly upon promoting export-oriented international subcontracts, technical marketing&#13;
agreements, and turn-key plants.&#13;
72.   Match-Making Fund (MMF). Under the Scheme, linkages will be established with small-&#13;
medium scale foreign private partner firms who would provide local potential exporters with: (a) access&#13;
to the external market network and market information for export products; (b) access to export&#13;
production know-how; and (c) access to the external market network and information on input sourcing.&#13;
Private local matchmakers, as well as foreign private investment brokers overseas, would identify&#13;
potential foreign collaborators, broker information on business opportunities in Madagascar, and use&#13;
their information network to link foreign collaborators with potential local partners. Matchmakers who&#13;
succeed in brokering a contract between local and foreign partners will receive a performance fee based&#13;
on the size and the nature of the contract. The payment of matchmaking fees will be shared between: (a)&#13;
the Matchmaking Fund to be established under this component; (b) the foreign partner; and (c) the local&#13;
exporter. (See Attachment 4 for details)&#13;
73.    The Project will finance over a period of three years the Matchmaking Fund which would&#13;
provide performance-based incentives to private business brokers and in the process, accelerate the&#13;
creation of a commercial market for this type of service; and further training to strengthen the pool of&#13;
local private investment brokers. The Match-making Fund will be managed by the FASP on a contract&#13;
basis.&#13;
m. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
74.    Project Benefits. The Project is projected to yield substantial economic benefits (as noted in&#13;
MOP para. 42) many of which are non-quantifiable, given the qualitative nature of the Project activities&#13;
and their impact. However, the following assessments can be made for individual Project components:&#13;
(a) Privatization. Expost quantitative estimates of economic returns to PE divestitures in other countries&#13;
(notably in the Galal et al. study of Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, and UK) indicate positive economic&#13;
welfare gains exceeding 10 percent in the majority of privatized PEs, with even stronger gains in some&#13;
2&#13;
cases in terms of expanded private investment and output and returns to innovation . In Madagascar, in&#13;
potentially viable activities, economic gains can be expected to be greater than in these cases, due to the&#13;
depleted capital stock in many PEs coupled with the public investment constraint, as well as the&#13;
correspondingly greater scope for productivity improvements. Consumer surpluses should be substantial&#13;
in cases (e.g., telecoms, ports, shipping) where new entrants improve service and competition reduces&#13;
prices. (b) Tax Reform. The tax administration overhaul is expected to yield major improvements in&#13;
terms of tax collections (from 7.7 percent of GDP in 1995, to about 11 percent of GDP in 1999), in&#13;
efficiency of tax administration (in terms of tax collections per tax service employee), and in scope&#13;
created for reduced fiscal deficits and thus increased public savings and reduced private sector borrowing&#13;
costs. (c) Private Sector Fund Matching Grant Scheme.  Other countries' (e.g., India, Kenya)&#13;
experiences indicate output gains of ten times the cost of productivity upgrading activities funded by&#13;
participating firms with matching grant program support. Rapid expansion of EPZ export activities in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project           17&#13;
Madagascar over 1990-94 suggest similar gains are feasible. (d) FDI Match-Making Scheme. Based&#13;
upon experiences elsewhere, the Scheme is expected to generate expanded foreign direct investment of&#13;
US$30 million over the life of the Project and an increase in annual exports of US$100million by the end&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
I. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
75.   The proposed project is estimated to cost, over a five year period, US$35.5 million equivalent.&#13;
Base costs calculated on the basis of December 1996 prices, are estimated at US$33.2 million and&#13;
physical and price contingencies have been calculated at 2.5 per cent per annum and are estimated at&#13;
US$2.3 million (7.0 per cent of base costs); the foreign exchange component would amount to US$17.4&#13;
million. The estimated cost of the five-year economic policy reform program would be US$17.8 million&#13;
equivalent; the cost of the three-year private sector capacity building program is estimated at US$12.7&#13;
million. Project preparation costs funded by the PPF amount to the equivalent of US$2 million.&#13;
76.   The project would be financed by an IDA credit of US$23.8 million equivalent, contributions&#13;
from the Government (US$6.1 million), and beneficiary private enterprises and associations (US$5.3&#13;
million). A contribution of US$0.4 million is also anticipated. The detailed cost estimates and financing&#13;
plan that are in Attachment I are summarized in the following tables.&#13;

78.    The PSF will be responsible for the procurement of the goods and services of all the private&#13;
sector capacity building components (matching-grant fund, CRC, FDI scheme and Seminars). The&#13;
Privatization Committee Technical Secretariat will be responsible for the procurement of goods and&#13;
services for the PE Divestiture component. The Ministry of Decentralization and Budget will be&#13;
responsible for procurement for part of the tax administration reform component, the IMF being&#13;
expected to be executive agency for this component. Procurement of goods (computers, equipment and&#13;
vehicles) will be made according to local shopping procedures, based on three quotations, for any single&#13;
contract totaling US$30,000 or less, in accordance with IDA's guidelines of January 1995. Contracts for&#13;
goods equal to or above US$30,000 will be procured in packages of at least US$100,000 whenever&#13;
possible, through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts for goods, whose cost will be&#13;
equal to or above US$50,000 will be subjected to prior review by IDA. Consultants' services (for studies&#13;
and technical services) which represent the bulk of IDA financing (US$9.97 million) will be contracted&#13;
in accordance with IDA's guidelines for the Use of Consultants (New Guidelines). All consultant&#13;
contracts, whose cost will be equal to or above US$50,000 for individual consultants and equal to or&#13;
above US$100,000 for firms, will be subjected to prior review by IDA; contracts below these thresholds&#13;
will be subject to ex-post review by the Association.&#13;
79.    Technical Assistance to be financed by the PSF. Eligible private enterprises and associations&#13;
will be assisted by the PSF in contracting directly the expertise they need. The statutes and the Manual of&#13;
Procedures of the PSF will specify that, to be eligible for financing, beneficiaries may select: (a) for&#13;
projects with total costs of less than US$5,000, individual consultants directly from the roster, or other&#13;
sources through the comparison of at least three CV's based upon terms of reference specifying&#13;
qualifications using a points scoring system; and (b) for projects with total costs of over US$5,000,&#13;
through competitive procedures acceptable to IDA. In both cases and for each assignment, the concerned&#13;
beneficiary will select or invite consultants to bid on the basis of a short list drawn from a roster prepared&#13;
by the PSF, or other sources. PSF's roster will be updated twice a year to include new consultants or&#13;
exclude unsatisfactory ones.  The Manual of Procedures of the PSF was agreed at IDA  credit&#13;
negotiations and its adoption was made a condition of credit effectiveness. Standard Letters of Invitation&#13;
to Bid that the beneficiaries of the PSF will use were agreed upon with IDA during appraisal. The&#13;
carrying out by PSF's beneficiaries of procurement procedures satisfactory to IDA is an eligibility&#13;
criterion to PSF's financial support.&#13;
80.    To ensure that procurement will be carried out adequately, AGETIPA, an agency which hias a&#13;
well-established track record of efficient procurement strictly following IDA guidelines, hias been&#13;
contracted to act as the procurement agency for the PSF and the CRC components of the project until&#13;
Project effectiveness. During this period, AGETIPA will train the concerned personnel of PSF in&#13;
procurement.&#13;
81.    Tax Administration Reform. The Borrower will invite the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department-&#13;
(FAD) to act as executing agency for this component of the Project (condition of disbursement). It is&#13;
expected that a technical assistance agreement would be signed between the Ministry of Decentralization&#13;
and Budget and  the IMF-FAD to formalize this arrangement.  In addition to one long-term tax&#13;
administration expert already funded by the IMF and in place since September 1996, a second long-term&#13;
expert in customs administration would be hired iiiitially for one year. The IMF will also be responsible&#13;
for short-term missions and the training program, while the Ministry of Finance will handle procurement&#13;
for goods.&#13;

III. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
82.   The IDA Credit is expected to be effective by June 1997; the privatization and tax administration&#13;
components of the project will be executed over the following five years, while the private sector&#13;
incentives and capacity building components will be executed over the following three years. Based&#13;
upon other developing countries' experiences, implementation over five years seems reasonable given&#13;
the size of the Malagasy privatization program. On the other hand, the capacity building components are&#13;
not expected to last more than three years. The success todate in implementing these types of&#13;
components elsewhere and the already well-advanced state of preparation of each component indicate&#13;
that their objectives can be met during this length of time. The following table gives the disbursement&#13;
schedule of the project which is supposed to be closed in June 30, 2002.&#13;

83.   Disbursement will be made on the basis of 100 percent of total expenditures free of direct or&#13;
indirect taxes and duties for IDA's share of the cost of goods and consultant services.&#13;
84.   The percentages have been based on the average of tax and duty rates and are calculated to&#13;
exclude local taxes and duties. The Project will refinance the PPF advance upon Project effectiveness.&#13;
As in the case of procurement, the FASP will act as disbursement agency for all goods and services&#13;
financed by the IDA Credit for the private sector capacity building components, while the Ministry of&#13;
Finance will disburse for the policy reform components, with the exception of services under the tax&#13;
reform component which will be under the IMF's responsibility. Disbursement will be fully documented&#13;
except for the payment of contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for goods and consultant firms,&#13;
US$50,000 for individual consultants and all operating costs, which will be made against certified&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Documents for withdrawal under SOEs will be retained by the FASP&#13;
and the Ministry of Finance and made available for independent auditors and for review by IDA during&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
85.   The IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed for the categories shown in Table 5 below over a&#13;
period of five years, following Project effectiveness.&#13;
86.   To expedite project implementation, two special accounts will be opened at a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA and maintained and operated on terms and conditions also acceptable to IDA by: (a)&#13;
the GOM for the privatization, incentives reform and tax reform components; and (b) the PSF for all&#13;
other components of the project. The Special Account administered by the GOM will be in the amount&#13;
of US$300,000. The special account for the private sector capacity building component will be in the&#13;
amount of US$600,000. The Association will make an initial deposit in the Special Accounts upon&#13;
credit effectiveness. Upon effectiveness, the borrower could claim one half of the authorized allocation&#13;
as the initial advance to the special account. The remainder would become payable as a supplementary&#13;
advance once one-third of the credit has been disbursed. Replenishment requests will be submitted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

bank statements and reconciliation of the concerned Special Account and will be fully documented&#13;
except for expenditures below US$100,000 for goods and services from consulting firms, and US$50,000&#13;
for services of individual consultants, for which the borrower will be allowed to submit claims on the&#13;
basis of SOEs. Documentation used for SOEs will be retained and made available for independent&#13;
auditors and for review by IDA during supervision missions.&#13;
87.    To ensure timely provision of local counterpart funds, the Government will open and maintain in&#13;
a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA an advance account, into which an initial&#13;
advance of the equivalent in FMG of US$50,000 will be made, and which will be periodically&#13;
replenished at that level.&#13;

IV. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
88.    The borrower possesses the ability to process and maintain SOE documentation in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, and appropriate accounting and control systems are in place for the expenditures&#13;
for which reimbursements would be claimed under the SOE procedures. All project accounts including&#13;
the two special accounts and SOEs will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.&#13;
These auditors will be recruited by the PSF and by GOM on a pluri-annual basis in accordance with the&#13;
terms of reference already used in Madagascar and short lists acceptable to IDA. The audit report will be&#13;
submitted to IDA no later than six months after the closing of the fiscal year in Madagascar. In addition&#13;

procedures and impact on client enterprises, during the first two years of operations.&#13;
SECTION C: IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
I. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
89.   Economic Policy Reform Program. Responsibility for the procurement, disbursement and&#13;
accounting for the three components of the policy reform program will be with the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Specific responsibility for implementing the privatization and tax reform programs will be delegated to&#13;
the Privatization Committee and the General Directorate of Fiscal Resources respectively, the former&#13;
attached to the Ministry of Private Sector Development and Privatization (MDSPP), the latter attached to&#13;
the Ministry of Decentralization and Budget (MB).  Meanwhile the market liberalization and private&#13;
sector incentives reform component will be managed by the Technical Secretariat for Adjustment (STA),&#13;
in close coordination with the CRC. The tax administration component is expected to be implemented&#13;
with the IMF-FAD as executing agency, arranging technical assistance, and undertaking overall&#13;
supervision and support.&#13;
90.   Private Sector Capacity Building Program. The PSF would act as the executing agent for the&#13;
private sector capacity building program carrying primary responsibility for the procurement,&#13;
disbursement and accounting for all four components. The CRC would be responsible for substantive&#13;
management of the competitiveness review dialogueue. The PSF will manage the Match-Making Fund&#13;
for the FDI Match-Making Scheme. The operational status of the PSF will be based on an official&#13;
Framework Agreement ("Convention") between the Government and the organization, ensuring its&#13;
operational independence and accountability. A local work group composed of representatives of the&#13;
business community has overseen the preparation of the legal and organizational framework for the PSF&#13;
and coordinated recruitment of its managing director.&#13;
L. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
91.   The implementation schedule of the project was agreed during negotiations. The project will be&#13;
implemented over a five-year period following effectiveness which is expected on June 30, 1997. The&#13;
credit is expected to be closed in December 2002. Detailed implementation timetables for the economic&#13;
policy reform program and the private sector capacity building program are included in Attachment 3.&#13;
III. KEY INDICATORS OF PROJECT PERFORMANCE&#13;
92.   Key performance indicators for all Project components have been defined by implementing&#13;
organizations and beneficiaries during Project appraisal, and confirmed at Credit negotiations. For the&#13;
FASP and CRC components, these were outputs of the project planning workshops, which also finalized&#13;
implementation plans and  timetables, and evaluation criteria, to ensure broad-based stakeholder&#13;
ownership. Agreed performance indicators are presented in Attachment 2.&#13;
93.   Economic Policy Reforms. Based upon the log-frame matrices in Attachment 2, proposed key&#13;
performance indicators (agreed at negotiations) are as follows: (I) Privatization Program: (a) increased&#13;
productivity, output and investment in privatized PEs and in new private entrants into privatized PE&#13;
sectors; (b) reduction in net budget transfers to PEs; (c) increased local private shareholding in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacitv Building Project                23&#13;
privatized PEs; (d) volume of PE divestiture transactions (privatizations and liquidations) completed&#13;
annually compared to agreed target; and (e) public awareness of, and support for, privatization program.&#13;
(II) Tax Administration Reform: (a) tax collections as % of GDP; (b) improved efficiency of VAT&#13;
collections and reimbursements to exporters; (c) increase in taxpayers registrations, in average taxpayer&#13;
tax payments, and in tax returns per tax official; and (d) increased taxpayer perception of transparency,&#13;
equity and accessibility of tax system. (IlI) Private Sector Incentives Reforms: (a) accelerated pace and&#13;
increased level of private investment due to removal of regulatory barriers-to-entry and procedural&#13;
bottlenecks; (b) increased level of foreign direct investment (FDI) due to relaxation of land access and&#13;
other barriers; (c) level of private investment in former state monopoly sectors; and (d) improved private&#13;
investor confidence in the business environment.&#13;
94.    Private Sector Capacity Building. Based UpOIn the log-frame matrix (Attachment 2), proposed&#13;
performance indicators for the four components (CRC, FASP, PSD Seminars, FDI Scheme) -- agreed at&#13;
Project negotiations -- are as follows: (a) expanded exports and output in assisted firms as % of total&#13;
export and output growth; (b) improvement in productivity and technical and managerial capabilities of&#13;
assisted firms compared to intemational norms; (c) expanded range of services and productivity of&#13;
participating local business support service providers; (d) consideration and adoption by Government of&#13;
at least four CRC recommendations a year; (e) expanded FDI and exports by firms participating in FDI&#13;
Scheme; and (f) increased private sector awareness of PSD policy reform issues, and international&#13;
market trends and requirements. The indicators in (a) - (f) are to be compared to relative performance of&#13;
a control group of firms not benefiting from the Capacity Building Program, the key performance&#13;
criterion being accelerated achievement by assisted firms as compared to non-assisted ones.&#13;
95.    Tracking and Measurement of Performance. As indicated in the log-frame matrices in&#13;
Attachment 2 annual sample surveys will be undertaken of: privatized PEs; private enterprises (including&#13;
foreign investors); taxpayers; and other stakeholder groups, in order to assess performance against&#13;
initially agreed targets, and against baseline-Year zero data. Funding for these limited-scale, stratified&#13;
sample surveys has been included in Project Costs.&#13;
IV. MONITORING AND PROGRESS REPORTING&#13;
96.    The action plans and tables of key activities, evaluation criteria and performance indicators,&#13;
prepared during Project appraisal and agreed at credit negotiations, for each of the components&#13;
(Attachment (2) will serve as a basis for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the respective&#13;
work programs. Three months before the end of each calendar year, the Government, private sector&#13;
project beneficiaries and IDA will convene an annual review meeting to review the results achieved&#13;
under each of the project components and prepare a detailed work program to be carried out during the&#13;
next year under each component. Finalization of the annual work programs for the CRC and the FASP&#13;
will be based on the results of project planning workshops which will be held prior to each review. Two&#13;
IDA-Government reviews of the project, in lieu of one mid-term review, will be carried out about one&#13;
and one half years and three years following the date of credit effectiveness to measure progress&#13;
accomplished against targets and define adjustments that may be required to ensure that the objectives of&#13;
the project will be achieved.&#13;
97.    Each of the project institutions will report quarterly on the results achieved with regard to the&#13;
component(s) for which they are responsible no later than one month after the end of the concerned&#13;
quarter. These reports would describe actual progress against agreed output targets, indicate existing or&#13;
potential difficulties that might affect project progress, provide a financial statement of project&#13;
expenditures, list the contracts concluded during the period and will give updated projections and plans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                   Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project&#13;
for future activity. The Borrower will submit to IDA a project completion report no later than six&#13;
months after the closing date of the Credit.&#13;
V. SUPERVISION&#13;
98.    The seven components included in the project will require intensive supervision initially,&#13;
estimated at about 25 staff weeks (sw) per year excluding IMF staff during the first two years and about&#13;
15 staff seeks/year thereafter. Africa Region Private Sector Development and Finance staff, as well as&#13;
staff from the FPD Vice-Presidency and EDI will be involved in the supervision and implementation&#13;
process. Supervision missions will be fielded three times a year for the first two years, and semi-&#13;
annually afterwards.&#13;
99.    The IMF plans to assist the Bank Group in supervising the substantive aspects of the tax system&#13;
and tax administration reform program. The Bank Group would retain overall supervision responsibility,&#13;
including procurement and disbursements.&#13;

MADAGASCAR - PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
Speeding Up Export Diversification Through Matchmaking Between Foreign and Local Firms&#13;
A.    Objective and Rationale&#13;
The objective of the matchmaking scheme is to build Malagasy firms' export capability by&#13;
facilitating collaboration between Malagasy firms and small and medium foreign partner firms. The&#13;
foreign partners are expected to provide external market access and production know-how, with or with&#13;
out investment finance, to the Malagasy partners.&#13;
Market Access - Given Madagascar's nascent manufacturing export capacity, one way to&#13;
develop access to external market networks, market information and production know-how is to promote&#13;
collaboration with foreign investors through foreign direct investment (FDI) joint ventures (JV),&#13;
international subcontracting agreements (SC), technical marketing agreements (T/MA) and turnkey&#13;
operations (TP). By providing the necessary know-how, these types of collaboration offer the best&#13;
opportunities for Malagasy partners to enter the world market as well as to acquire skills required for&#13;
exporting.&#13;
Recent World Bank studies have confirmed that foreign partners' lack of interest in collaboration&#13;
with local firms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) stem primarily from imperfect market information on&#13;
export-oriented collaboration opportunities and the negative investment image in many African&#13;
countries. The matchmaking scheme would help address these constraints by giving incentives for&#13;
private matchmakers to use their information networks to bring together foreign and local firms in export&#13;
oriented ventures.&#13;
B.    Guidelines for the Matchmaking Fund and Matchmaking Fund Management&#13;
1.    Partnership Contract Performance - Based Fee Payment System&#13;
The key principle underlying the matchmaking fund (MMF) is the promotion of&#13;
Malagasy/foreign partnership contracts brokered by facilitators, remunerated under a performance-based&#13;
fee payment system. For this system to be successful partnership contract performance indicators must&#13;
be transparent, and provide the necessary incentive for effective contract implementation. The following&#13;
are key partnership contract performance indicators:&#13;
(a) JV or 100% FDI: Shareholders' total investment value;&#13;
(b) SC, TMA and TP: export earnings of the 12 months operation from the time exports begin.&#13;
(Besides being the key measure of success of nonequity partnerships, this performance&#13;
indicator is administratively simpler to monitor thani contract or subcontract orders/fees or&#13;
royalty payments.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project            Attachment 4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Matchmaker services are deemed to have been completed on:&#13;
(a) Finalization of a collaboration agreement between the foreign and Malagasy partner firms;&#13;
and&#13;
(b) Finalization of all administrative procedures required by the Malagasy authorities for the&#13;
approval and implementation of partnership contracts.&#13;
To qualify for MMF support in terms of the matchmaking fee, a team of foreign/Malagasy&#13;
matchmakers must have assisted the foreign and Malagasy partner firms. During project preparation the&#13;
matchmaking pilot scheme underlined the importance of Malagasy matchmakers in assisting (b) above.&#13;
2.    Key Aspects of Matchmaking Fee Payments&#13;
Success or failure of an export-oriented foreign-Malagasy enterprise matchmaking program will&#13;
depend on:&#13;
(a) fixing matchmaking fees at a optimum level to provide the necessary incentive to&#13;
matchmakers to maximize foreign/local collaboration;&#13;
(b) arrangements to share fee costs between the MMF and the foreign and the Malagasy&#13;
partners;&#13;
(c) timing of fee payments by MMF and the foreign and the Malagasy partners;&#13;
(d) administrative convenience.&#13;
Initial fee amounts will be based on experience in the pilot project and will be widely publicized&#13;
before the implementation of the MMF. Periodic reviews of MMF will, however, determine whether&#13;
these fees are effective in developing partnerships; and MMF Management will have the flexibility to&#13;
adjust these fees, within certain parameters, based on the periodic reviews.&#13;
3.     Optimum Level of Matchmaking Fees&#13;
The legacy of inward-oriented economic policies and isolation means that the Malagasy MMF&#13;
will not succeed unless there is strong collaboration between Malagasy and foreign matchmakers -&#13;
involving extensive business travel to initiate, identify and design potential partnership projects.&#13;
Lack of information on Africa, and in particular Madagascar, has resulted in very limited&#13;
exchanges with the outside world. Matchmakers must, therefore be given enough incentive to invest&#13;
their time and resources to carry out comprehensive business exchanges. The incentive should also take&#13;
into account time spent on consulting and intermediation, and the fact that a large proportion of&#13;
matchmaking attempts will not be consummated. Unless matchmakers feel that the advertised&#13;
matchmaking fees are reasonable enoughi to cover these costs, they will not undertake activities under the&#13;
MMF.&#13;
Based on available international data and the Malagasy context, it is recommended that MMF&#13;
Management offer the following initial level of matchmaking fees:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Madagascar: Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project          Attachment 4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(a) FDI or JV: 6% of the shareholders' total investment value;&#13;
(b) SC, T/MA, and/or TP; 7% of the total 12 month export value from the time of the first&#13;
export under the partnership contract.&#13;
4.    Matchmaking Fee Payment Shzaring Arrangements&#13;
To ensure commitment by the beneficiary, while at the same time offsetting matchmaking costs&#13;
during an initial period (aimed at developing a competitive market in matchmakers); matchmaking fees&#13;
will be paid equally by the MMF (50%) and the collaborating Malagasy and foreign partners (50%).&#13;
For Malagasy and foreign partners in a JV, their 50% share of the matchmaking fee will be&#13;
assigned in proportion to their relative equity participation; while in SC, T/MA, or TP projects&#13;
matchmaking fees will be shared equally between Malagasy and foreign partners. (i.e. Malagasy and&#13;
5.    Maximunt Ceiling of Fee Payments by MMF&#13;
To ensure the efficient allocation of resources and encourage partnerships with a significant&#13;
number of Malagasy SMEs rather than a few large partnership contracts, the ceiling on MMF payments&#13;
for total matchmaking fee payments will be set at US$50 000. Malagasy and foreign partner payments&#13;
will not however be subject to a prescribed ceiling, but will be based on their willingness to pay&#13;
matchmaking fees, taking into account the agreed MMF cost sharing formula and MMF ceiling.&#13;
6.     Timing of Matchmaking Fee Payments&#13;
First Fee Payments by Malagasy and foreign partners should be made on presentation of&#13;
documentary evidence by the matchmakers demonstrating:&#13;
(a) investment has been completed for JV or FDI;&#13;
(b) completion of the 12 month export period since the first export under the partnership&#13;
contract for SC, T/MA, or TP.&#13;
Fee Payments by MMF Management is only made once there is documentary evidence that&#13;
Malagasy and foreign partners have made their fee payments. This sequence of matchmaking payments:&#13;
(a) promotes market-based matchmaking procedures;&#13;
(b) minimizes MMF Management's administrative burden, which is shifted to the matchmakers.&#13;
Limited advance payments in the form of travel costs may be given to assist matchmakers&#13;
(especially Malagasy matchmakers) in meeting their working capital matchmaking requirements. This&#13;
will be based on careful review by MMF Management - in collaboration with FASP Management - of&#13;
concrete matchmaking projects and will be financed by FASP and not MMF financial resources. Such&#13;
advances will be deducted from matchmaking fee payments, if the supported travel has led to partnership&#13;
contracts, preventing double dipping (see below).&#13;
A Written Matchmaking Fee Agreement between the Malagasy and foreign matchmakers must&#13;
be presented to MMF Management, preferably before matchmaking activities begin.&#13;

7.    Eligibility&#13;
Partnership types: 100% export-oriented FDI, JV, SC, T/MA and TP are eligible for MMF&#13;
support, but simple export/import contracts are not eligible.&#13;
Sectors: 100% export-oriented manufacturing, agro, forestry, fishery, mining, data processing,&#13;
and service industries are all eligible for MMF support.&#13;
Malagasy and foreign partners: Malagasy enterprises with at least 51%  of their equity&#13;
privately held or SME cooperatives in Madagascar and enterprises or SME cooperatives of any foreign&#13;
economy are eligible for MMF support.&#13;
Malagasy and foreign matchmakers need to be registered with the MMF Management to be&#13;
eligible for MMF support. Registration requirements for matchmakers are:&#13;
(a) a working knowledge of English or any other international business language (other than&#13;
traditional Malagasy business languages);&#13;
(b) familiarity with export-oriented FDI, JV, SC, T/MA and TP international operations and&#13;
related Malagasy rules and regulations (including building and expatriate labor work permits,);&#13;
(c) familiarity and contacts with the business community in a foreign economy (Malagasy&#13;
matchmakers) and in Madagascar (Malagasy and foreign partners);&#13;
(d) a well established good business reputation in their respective business communities.&#13;
(e) participation in matchmaker training schemes (Malagasy matchmakers).&#13;
To ensure that the MMF supports diversified export-oriented partnerships and not traditional&#13;
trading partnerships that would have occurred without MMF support, Malagasy and foreign&#13;
matchmakers must be registered with MMF Management before initiating any matchmaking activities.&#13;
Double Dipning will be prevented through close collaboration with the FASP. FASP financial&#13;
support for foreign travel of a Malagasy matchmaker, or inward mission of a foreign matchmaker, will&#13;
be deducted from the matchmaking fee payments by MMF in the event that a partnership contract is&#13;
concluded.&#13;
8.     Training of Malagasy Matchmakers&#13;
Training of Malagasy matchmakers will be one of the first tasks of MMF Management, whici&#13;
will focus on developing new matchmakers not previously targeted under the pilot program. An&#13;
orientation program will also be provided for all registered Malagasy matchmakers which will include:&#13;
(a) details of the matchmaking scheme and MMF Management Guidelines;&#13;
(b) orientation on Malagasy Government agencies' rules, regulations, and administrative&#13;
procedures for and to implement FDI, JV, SC, T/MA and TP partnership;&#13;
(c) orientation on international practices in FDI, JV, SC, T/MA and TP contract documents;&#13;

9.    International Marketing of the Matchmaking Scheme&#13;
To stimulate interest from foreign matchmakers, MMF management will prepare and implement&#13;
an international marketing strategy using such tools as the media (Business Development), internet and&#13;
where appropriate the appointment of marketing agents in target countries.&#13;
