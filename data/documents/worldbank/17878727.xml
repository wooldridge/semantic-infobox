&#13;
                         A joint meeti~g of the Executive Directors of the&#13;
&#13;
            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
&#13;
            and the International Development Association was convened&#13;
&#13;
            at 10:00 o'clock, a.m., in the Board Room, 1818 H Street,&#13;
&#13;
            N. W., Washington, D. C., Mr. Roberts. McNamara, President,&#13;

&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     12&#13;
&#13;
          project, to which both the government and ourselves attach&#13;
&#13;
          the highest priority:&#13;
&#13;
                       These benefits will be widespread and substantial.&#13;
&#13;
          The project would help meet shortages of manpower, in both&#13;
&#13;
          public and private sectors of the economy; and make a&#13;
&#13;
          si.gnifican.t contribution to improving the quality of the output&#13;
&#13;
          of the school system.     Agricultural and technical sources&#13;
&#13;
          would be introduced into the secondary school curricular;&#13;
&#13;
          an.d agricultural training facilities would be expanded and&#13;
&#13;
          imJ?roved.&#13;
&#13;
                       The education system would, thus, become increasingly&#13;
&#13;
          more relevan.t to the ne.e ds of the local and national economy.&#13;
&#13;
                       The size of the project is related to the foreseeable&#13;
&#13;
          demand for manpower in the modern sector of the economy -- both&#13;
&#13;
          to provide for economic growth; and for the progressive re-&#13;
&#13;
          placement of foreigners, both in public and private sectors,&#13;
&#13;
          and in the education system itself.      The proportion of trained&#13;
&#13;
          Cameroonians, in both primary and secondary education, would&#13;
&#13;
          rise sharply during the next few years as a result of the&#13;
&#13;
          project.     The re.placement of expatriates in the priva te sector&#13;
&#13;
          is evidently a slower process, particularly in a growing&#13;
&#13;
          economy; and the proport i on of foreigners is not e xpe cted to&#13;
&#13;
          decline appre ciably during the next f ive or six years. But, in&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     13&#13;
&#13;
          the longer run, the continuing flow of trained secondary&#13;
&#13;
          graduates from the education system, will facilitate more&#13;

                      : meroonian participation&#13;
          extensive CaÂ·                           in the private sector&#13;
&#13;
          of the economy as well.&#13;
&#13;
                    The map at the end of the appraisal report illus-&#13;
&#13;
          trates anot!er important characteristic of this project:&#13;
&#13;
          the schools are planned to be developed in every major region&#13;
&#13;
          of the country.   It will i:mp;rove the regional balance of the&#13;
&#13;
          educational system, and, thus, give greater opportunities for&#13;
&#13;
          the education and advancement of large numbers of able pupils&#13;
&#13;
          throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
                    This is all complemented by the government's balance&#13;
&#13;
          regional development program:    :cotton and rice in the north;&#13;
&#13;
          forestry and timber products in the southeast; plantation&#13;
&#13;
          projects and smallholder tea production in the west; and by&#13;
&#13;
          the planned improvements in the transportation system.&#13;
&#13;
                    To sum up:   The proposed project is expected to :make&#13;
&#13;
          an important contribution to the development of Cameroon, and&#13;
&#13;
          is closely linked to development efforts in other sectors;&#13;
&#13;
          and, therefore, fully justifies your support.&#13;
&#13;
                    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA: Thank you, Mr. Wilkinson.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Carriere.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           14&#13;
&#13;
                             MR. CARRIERE:   Mr. Chairman, I have no particular&#13;
&#13;
          comment on the project itself -- which seems to me to be very&#13;
&#13;
          well conceived, and which will help Cameroon to finance a&#13;
                  ....eCJ.&#13;
          very need/improvement of its educational system.&#13;
&#13;
                             In the course of the two previous years, Cameroon&#13;
&#13;
          has benefited of low crecd'i ts from IDA, except a credit of&#13;
&#13;
          $600,000 in 1968.            But this country preferred not to postpone&#13;
&#13;
          its major development projects, and agreed to have them&#13;
&#13;
          financed by Bank loans, in spite of the cost incurred.&#13;
&#13;
          Thii.s is the ;reason why I particularly welcome the resumption&#13;
&#13;
          of IDA's activity in Cameroon; and I fully support your&#13;
&#13;
          recomunendation.&#13;
&#13;
                             Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. McNAMARA:       Thank you, Mr. Carriere.&#13;
&#13;
                             Gentlemen, are there other --&#13;
&#13;
                         Mr .. Rice.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. RICE:      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                         We welcome the credit to the Cameroon for an&#13;
&#13;
          educati.o n project.         We believe this particular project is a&#13;
&#13;
          good one, and we are . glad to give it our full support.&#13;
&#13;
          However, one aspect of the loan agreement gives us concern;&#13;
&#13;
          and this is the extension of the 15 percent margin of preferenc&#13;
&#13;
          to the other Member Countries of UDEAC.            I refer in the documen&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    15&#13;
&#13;
          to page 4, paragraph 15, of your report.&#13;
&#13;
                    Some weeks ago, when the Board considered and&#13;
&#13;
          approved a power loan to Costa Rica, I expressed reservations&#13;
&#13;
          as to the appropriateness of the similar procedure in the case&#13;
&#13;
          of the members of the Central American Common Market.     I said&#13;
&#13;
          then that I thought the implications of this practice had not&#13;
&#13;
          been f~lly thought through, and that our support for that&#13;
&#13;
          project should not be taken as s~pport for extension of the&#13;
&#13;
          preference margin.&#13;
&#13;
                    I, also, expressed the   hope that approval of that&#13;
&#13;
          loan would not serve to establish a policy precedent in this&#13;
&#13;
          area.&#13;
&#13;
                    I continue to hold to this view, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
          perhaps mQre strongly, because with this credit and the&#13;
&#13;
          inclusion of this provisison, it appears tnat we are&#13;
&#13;
          moving one step closer to establishing a policy precedent;&#13;
&#13;
          and that continuing to move in this direction would, of course,&#13;
&#13;
          strengthen it as a policy.&#13;
&#13;
                    We do   have reservations about this.   But, with&#13;
&#13;
          these reservations recorded, we are glad to give our support to&#13;
&#13;
          the 'credit and the project.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA:   Thank you, Mr. Rice.&#13;
&#13;
                    I must confess, I don't fully understand the problems&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     16&#13;
&#13;
          you foresee by extension of the 15 percent preference to a&#13;
&#13;
          customs union, which, in effect, exists        as I understand it&#13;
&#13;
          in this situation.      But, since you have indicated you would&#13;
&#13;
          approve the project, I won't pursue the matter, today. But I&#13;
&#13;
          would, at your convenience, like time to talk to you and&#13;
&#13;
          understand more fully the problems you see in this kind of a&#13;
&#13;
          policy.     The amount involved in this case is very, very small;&#13;
&#13;
          and I think we can certainly accept the project, as proposed.&#13;
&#13;
                      But I will make an effort to more fully understand th&#13;
&#13;
          problems that you see if we continue to do this in other&#13;
&#13;
          respects.&#13;
&#13;
                      Gentlemen, are there other comments?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. RICE:   ~hank   you.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McNAMARA: Dr. Machado.&#13;
&#13;
                      DR. MACHADO:    I fully support this project, and I&#13;
&#13;
          saw no need of speaking in connection with it -- but the&#13;
&#13;
          statement just made by my distinguished colleague, the&#13;
&#13;
          Director from the United States, forces me to remind this&#13;
&#13;
          Board that this 15 percent prefexence for local suppliers is&#13;
&#13;
          something that we accept generally in this Bank, when we are&#13;
&#13;
          dealing with furnishing machinery, equipment, and industrial go     c&#13;
          for countries; and I see no reason why we should not apply the&#13;
&#13;
          same thing to education.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         17&#13;
&#13;
                    It is very hard, even with this 15 percent margin,&#13;
&#13;
          for sma:lL' industries and manufacturers in developing countries&#13;
&#13;
          to compete with the usual suppliers: and this is the only&#13;
&#13;
          chance, in my opinion, that local industries have of using&#13;
&#13;
          their own products in their own development.     The extension&#13;
&#13;
          of the principle to members of a common economic area, and&#13;
&#13;
          a common market, is, in my opinion, one of the best things&#13;
&#13;
          this Bank has done.&#13;
&#13;
                    I have been receiving, and passing on to our&#13;
&#13;
          President and members of the staff, many letters of praise&#13;
&#13;
          for the adoption of this policy by the    Directors~   and I&#13;
&#13;
          hope that in weighing the statement of my colleague's from&#13;
&#13;
          the United States you will also weigh that there are also&#13;
&#13;
          opinions on the other side of the fence on the same problem.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA:     Yes.   I am very sensitive to the&#13;
&#13;
          advantage of this to the customs union members, or the common&#13;
&#13;
          market countries.     And it has seemed to me an entirely natural&#13;
&#13;
          progression, or step, or evolution of the policy that we have&#13;
&#13;
          followed for years.     But it may be that I am failing to under-&#13;
&#13;
          stand some aspect of it that Mr. Rice and his country has in&#13;
&#13;
          mind, and I will inform myself of it; and if at some later&#13;
&#13;
          point, either he or you, or others, wish to enter into a&#13;
&#13;
          fuller discussion of this matter, unrelated to a particular&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     18&#13;
&#13;
          project, I will be quite happy to schedule such a discussion&#13;
&#13;
          for the Board.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Young.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. YOUNG:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                    This appears an excellent project, and I support&#13;
&#13;
          fully.&#13;
&#13;
                    I was interested in the analysis of the project on&#13;
&#13;
          page 10 of the appraisal report, which   sho1~   the enrollments&#13;
&#13;
          for the different fields in the education project. And I&#13;
&#13;
          would have hoped that in the future some greater emphasis coul&#13;
&#13;
          be given to the higher agricultural section, in view of the&#13;
&#13;
          great dependence of the country on agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
                    It was only an increase from 70 to 120, and,&#13;
&#13;
          presumably, it is the higher agricultural section which&#13;
&#13;
          provides the extension officers, if I am correct there;&#13;
&#13;
          rather than the technical and vocational.    If that is true,&#13;
&#13;
          then, presumably, there is a lot of work still to be done in&#13;
&#13;
          disseminating the information around to the farmers.&#13;
&#13;
                    One other aspect or question I have is on page 15 of&#13;
&#13;
          the appraisal report. And I do welcome the way in which you&#13;
&#13;
          have arranged for the cost per place to be set out under the&#13;
&#13;
          various headings.   This does now highlight, in my mind, some&#13;
&#13;
          of the differences that occur. And I am not quite sure of the&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           19&#13;
&#13;
          reasons for the differences.         This does apply in all the&#13;
&#13;
          sections; but, just take the case of "Boarding."          I didn't&#13;
&#13;
          follow why the 1tCost per Boarder" or the area should be&#13;
&#13;
          different, say, between "General secondary" and "Technical&#13;
&#13;
          secondaryr" and the costs move inversely.         1\nd why the&#13;
&#13;
          "Furniture" requirements for "Technical secondary" should&#13;
&#13;
          be so much greater than for "Teacher training" would in places.&#13;
&#13;
          These sort of differences are highlighted in this analysis,&#13;
&#13;
          and I wondered whether the staff might make some comment&#13;
&#13;
          on. this.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McNAMARA:     Yes.   Sure.   Let me start with your&#13;
&#13;
          first point, however -- the question of the proposed enrollment&#13;
&#13;
          versus the existing enrollment in higher agricultural&#13;
&#13;
          education versus the other types of education.&#13;
&#13;
                      Mr. Wilkinson, would you-- or,if you prefer, one&#13;
&#13;
          of your associates -- care to comment on that?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. WILKINSON:     Perhaps Mr. Germanacos.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. NcNAMARA:     Yes. Go right ahead, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. GERMANACOS:    The proposed enrollment of 120&#13;
&#13;
          at the agricultural school does not show the part-time courses&#13;
&#13;
          that will be held for extension workers, for students who&#13;
&#13;
          have completed the lower agricultural schools in the system,&#13;
&#13;
          and will be taken in from time to time into~art-time courses&#13;

                           The present enrollment       o~   120 is to turn out some-&#13;
&#13;
          thi~g     like 20 . graduates per year for Cameroon itself.              And our&#13;
&#13;
          investigations show that this will be adequ.ate               ~or   the next&#13;
&#13;
          few years ..&#13;
&#13;
                           MR. McNAMARA:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                           One of the major problems in education financing, I&#13;
&#13;
          am su.re all of you realize, is to avoid diverting an excessive&#13;
&#13;
          quantity of the country's resources, scarce resources, into&#13;
&#13;
          educational fields earlier than is absolutely essential to&#13;
&#13;
          match with other parts of the economy and its development.&#13;
&#13;
                           Education has such a high appeal, a high political&#13;
&#13;
          ap~eal,        that there is a   da~ger   of excessive     financi~g,    excessiv&#13;
&#13;
          expansion.         And our Educational Projects Department and&#13;
&#13;
          a,rea departments are being very careful to try to avoid that.&#13;
&#13;
          I feel fairly confident we haven't excessively financed educa-&#13;
&#13;
          tion, so far. But it is a consta,nt danger that we need to be&#13;
&#13;
          a,ware of .. And we make eveJJy effort, therefore, in           establishi~g&#13;
&#13;
          proposed enrollments, to be sure that they match                w~t~     an&#13;
&#13;
          opt:i:m'lirl division of scarce resources in the count.r y, and the&#13;
&#13;
          probable :t:"ate of advance in other sectors of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
                           Now your second qu.esÂ·tion:        "'Why the apparent&#13;
&#13;
          contradictions and iJ?.equalities in the per PllPil cost, shown in&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      21&#13;
&#13;
          the table on page 15?"&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Wilkinson, you, or one of your associates may&#13;
&#13;
          wish to comment on that.&#13;
&#13;
                     Take, for example, the point    Mr. Young raised:&#13;
          the "Furniture Cost per Boarder" for "Technical secondary"&#13;
                                           -er&#13;
          schools at $65 versus $44 per Board/in "Teacher training."&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WILKINSON:     Mr. Vera, would you like to comment&#13;
&#13;
          on that?&#13;
&#13;
                     .M,R. VERA:   The reason for the difference is the&#13;
&#13;
          amount of pupils who are in the Boarder school are higher&#13;
&#13;
          than the number of pupils with lower cost per student place.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. NcNAMARA:     There being some fixed costs, in effe t;&#13;
&#13;
          and some variable costs.     And with a smaller number of pupils&#13;
&#13;
          in the "Teacher training" than the "Technical secondary"&#13;
&#13;
          the fixed costs per pupil are higher; and, hence, the total&#13;
&#13;
          cost -- or, exactly the reverse:      the smaller number of pupils&#13;
&#13;
          in the "Technical secondary" schools the fixed costs per&#13;
&#13;
          pupil are higher; and, hence, the total costs are higher.&#13;
&#13;
                     What are the number of pupils -- number of boarder&#13;
&#13;
          pupils in the "Teacher training" versus the "~echnical&#13;
&#13;
          secondary" in the project?&#13;
&#13;
                     It's roughly twice the --&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. GERMANACOS:    One hundred eighty in each.      In&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        22&#13;
&#13;
          "Te~cher     trainitig" it's 500.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAMARA;     So that the three times or four&#13;
&#13;
          times greater n:unber in "Teacher training" leads to the lower&#13;
&#13;
          per unit cost, Mr. Young.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. GERMANACOS:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:      Gentlemen, are there other comments&#13;
&#13;
          or questions on this proposal?&#13;
&#13;
                        {Silence]&#13;
&#13;
                        If not, we will consider it approved.&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Kochman, would you care to comment?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. KOCHMAN:     Mr. Chairman, this project gives me the&#13;
&#13;
          occasion to underline the very good relationship that has&#13;
&#13;
          cteveloped between the World Bank Group and the Federal Republic&#13;
&#13;
          of the Cameroon.      Judging by . the number of credits and loans&#13;
&#13;
          that have been given to that country in the last three years&#13;
&#13;
          to be more precise since 1967 -- I think I must say that Camero n&#13;
&#13;
          is   ~mea~   the countries in my group that are in .a good place.&#13;
&#13;
          This situation is widely recognized by the federal authorities&#13;
&#13;
          of Cameroon, and that is why the President of the Federal&#13;
&#13;
          Republic has asked me personally to express his deep apprecia-&#13;
&#13;
          tion of the Federal Government for the great assistance that&#13;
&#13;
          has been given by the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:      Thank you very much, sir.&#13;
