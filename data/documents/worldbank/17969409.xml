                    A OONI ERSATION WI'ffi ANDREW KAMARCK. I                       this would be a very good thing.      (I didn't know at the time. but later&#13;
&#13;
                                New York City                                      found out. that Martin talked to Black and Black was fully informed of&#13;
&#13;
                              Nov-.ber 2. 1985                                     my position.)&#13;
&#13;
                              Robert W. Oliver                                          The McCarthy thing is almost impossible to explain in a short&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   period of time.     Basically. what   happened was this.    In 1947. I had&#13;
&#13;
OLnfER:     I think we might begin our conversation. Andy, by my asking if         been approached by Norman Ness. who was then the head of the economic&#13;
&#13;
you would say a bit about how you came to the Bank in the first place              and financial side of the State Department. to come over to the State&#13;
&#13;
and something about the things you did.      Maybe you will then give a            Department as his deputy.     I wasn't sure I wanted to leave the Treasury&#13;
general iâ&#128;¢pression of the history of the Bank in whatever way you care             at that time. but he approached me and asked if I had any objection to&#13;
&#13;
to.                                                                                his at least talking to people in the State Department.        He put my name&#13;
KAMARCK      In a sense, ., coming to the Bank is rather difficult to              into the process.&#13;
explain.     (This is something that Black, Garner. and Dave Sommers knew               At that point. there was an investigation in      Congress as to how&#13;
&#13;
about. I'm not sure if BUrke Knapp knew about it.)       Burke Knapp               the State Department was handling security investigations.           The State&#13;
&#13;
approached me about coaing to the Bank.       I was very interested.       I was   Department cooperated. and Congressional investigators picked up about&#13;
&#13;
actually hoping that he would ask me to come to the Bank.          This was in     100 sample files.     Mine was among them.   The investigators went through&#13;
&#13;
1950.     I had just gotten back from Italy (I had been the Treasury               the files and made a summary of any derogatory information.           Well. the&#13;
&#13;
representative and Head of the Finance Division of the Marshall Plan),             derogatory information in my file was the fact that I had worked with a&#13;
&#13;
and I was told by Martin, who vas then Assistant Secretary of the                  couple of people who were suspected of espionage.      These were basically&#13;
&#13;
Treasury, that I vas on MCCarthy's list.      This is something I had not          Harry White and Harold Glasser in the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
realized.    Hartin said that he had talked to Secretary Snyder and both                These files were collected before the investigation work was&#13;
&#13;
of them wanted me to know that if I were challenged or attacked, they              completed. Later on, when McCarthy made his speech (he had been told&#13;
&#13;
would come to my defense, but they hoped something like that wouldn't              about the files), he used these 100 names.       He just said. "I have 100&#13;
&#13;
happen-- for sy sake, as well as the Treasury's sake.          When this           names here that are suspicious.       They are menaces, and the State&#13;
&#13;
opportunity came up almost immediately (BUrke Knapp talked to me about             Department hasn't done anything about it."      He made the speech in 1950,&#13;
&#13;
going to the Bank) I had some interest in it already; it struck me that            three years after my State Department discussions.         (After the Marshall&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                3                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Plan had come up in 1947. I wanted to go to Italy to work on European             You must have known several people in the Bank.      Had this been from&#13;
&#13;
recovery. I had been in Italy during the War. and I wanted to take                Treasury days?&#13;
&#13;
Margie there. so I told Nonaan I didn't want the State Department job.            KAMARCK:    In the case of Burke Knapp. I'd known him from the Federal&#13;
&#13;
The whole thing. as far as I was concerned. finished right there.           I     Reserve Board.     1 was borrowed by the Treasury:   I went over to the&#13;
&#13;
didn't realize that those 100 files were on file in Congress.)                    Treasury at the time Burke was coming onto the Board.        1 knew him&#13;
&#13;
     At any rate. I came into the Bank.     The reason the circuastances          because my last job before I went to Italy was Chairman of the National&#13;
&#13;
are important is that I caae to the Bank in a fairly senior position.             Advisory Council. an inter-departmental coordinating committee.          The&#13;
&#13;
Black was glad to have me. but be wanted to protect me in the Bank.               title was National Advisory Council for International Monetary and&#13;
&#13;
For a nuaber of years. he thought this was a sensitive subject.          He did   Financial Problems.     I was the chair of the staff committee. and BUrke&#13;
&#13;
not want me put in any position where I or the Bank would be exposed.             was the Federal Reserve representative.     That committee also became the&#13;
&#13;
So I was made Economic Advisor to Europe. Africa and Australasia.                 staff committee for designing the economic and financial aspects of&#13;
&#13;
(Economic advisor's titles never appeared in the phone book.)       It            exchange rates under the Marshall plan.&#13;
&#13;
wasn't until Woods caae along that he was willing to give me a                    OLNER:     This is ancient history. but did you go straight from Harvard&#13;
&#13;
different title -- that he was willing. the Bank was willing in a                 to the Federal Reserve System?&#13;
&#13;
sense. to put me in a position that was exposed.                                  KAMARCK:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
CLN ER:    May I ask two questions.   You say the names were not in the           OLNER:     O.K.    Well. let's come back to where we were.    You were    an&#13;
&#13;
phone book.     Was this a summary phone book?   Today the Bank 1 s phone         economic advisor in the Bank until the beginning of the Woods years â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
book has everybody's na.e in it. including the secretaries.                       KAMARCK:   When I came to the Bank. there was an Economics Department.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    Everybody's name was in the phone book. but in terms of               The Bank was being shuffled and reshuffled as they were trying to find&#13;
&#13;
titles. it had only department directors and assistant directors.           It    the proper set-up.     Shortly after I came to the Bank (it was after a&#13;
&#13;
didn't have economic advisors.                                                    year and a half or something like that) the Bank was reshuffled again.&#13;
&#13;
OLN ER:    I see.                                                                 The area departments were set up: the Projects Department was set up:&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:      Now they have it right through the division.    At that time        and the Economics Department was shrunk down to a few people working on&#13;
&#13;
it was highly. highly selective. shall we say.                                    external debt and a few people working on commodities.       In fact. the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    The other question.   1 take it you knew Burke Knapp already.          commodities people didn't exist at first.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                5                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       At that point. there was an econaaic advisor appointed in each of        frustrated.     They didn't feel they were having enough to say in what&#13;
&#13;
the area departments.     At that time there were only three area               was going on.&#13;
&#13;
departments.    One covered Europe. Africa. and Australasia; one covered             When this reshuffle took place. in 1952 I guess it was (when the&#13;
&#13;
Asia: and one covered Latin    ~rica.    I was the econaaic advisor for         area departments and the Projects Department were set up). most of the&#13;
&#13;
the first of these.     Then. as the Bank grew. as we were lending less         econaaists felt this was a big step forward because it put them into&#13;
&#13;
and less in Europe and the reconstruction phase was diminishing. it was         the deparbaents where they were going to make decisions. where they&#13;
&#13;
decided to set up a separate Africa     Depar~nt.   The Bank still had a        would be involved with real problems. real policies and real decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Europe Department. and I had a choice of departments.      I decided Africa     What was left to the economics staff. as I said. was small. basically&#13;
&#13;
was more interesting.                                                           ezternal debt questions.     Then it was discovered that many countries&#13;
&#13;
       I was in the Africa Department as Economic Advisor for four or           were one-commodity countries. BUt you couldn't have somebody working on&#13;
&#13;
five years. something of that kind.     Then Jiâ&#128;¢ Coleman of UCLA called me      Bratil be an ezpert on coffee. and somebody working on the Ivory Coast&#13;
&#13;
and asked me whether I would like to co.e to UCLA as a Regents                  be an expert on coffee. and somebody working on Kenya be an expert on&#13;
&#13;
Professor.     I took leave from the Bank for that purpose and was in Loa       coffee.     It made much more sense to have one expert on coffee to     look&#13;
&#13;
Angeles when Woods caae in.    When I caae back to the Bank. I came back        at the whole coffee position in the world.     So a small commodities&#13;
&#13;
as Head of the Economics Depart.ent.                                            staff was built up under Rist.&#13;
&#13;
       The Bank is a unique organization.   The management was trying to        OLEIER:     Let us jump to the economics work after George Woods became&#13;
&#13;
figure out ezactly how to organize the Bank to do the job best.       There     President and you became head of the Economics Department.        Would you&#13;
&#13;
were several theories as to how it should be done.      Whatever they tried     say a bit on how that department evolved.     What did you perceive was&#13;
&#13;
didn't work as well as they thought it should work.      Of course.             George Woods' reason for wanting to strengthen the economic work in the&#13;
&#13;
personalities came in to this thing too.     The head of the economics          Bank?     What was your role and the role of Irving Friedman in the&#13;
&#13;
staff at that time was Leonard Rist.     Leonard Rist was not a strong          development of this work?&#13;
&#13;
personality.    He was not even much of an economist.    He didn't really       KAHARCK:     Well. it began to be more and more obvious that there should&#13;
&#13;
want to be an economist.     He was there primarily because they felt a         be some central economic work in the Bank.     It was also fairly obvious&#13;
&#13;
Frenchman should have a principal role. and this is where they stuck            that there should be some kind of strong central economic leadership.&#13;
&#13;
him.    Consequently. the economics people under Leonard Riat   alw~s    felt   One of the important decisions that had to be made in the Bank's&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                 8&#13;
                                                                7&#13;

creditworthiness.    In each of the area departments. you had economists&#13;
                                                                                     The Economic Committee did a fair amount of useful work. This was&#13;
working on this -- the top person being the economic advisor.         But you&#13;
                                                                                a good place for coordination.      In those days. the Bank didn't deal&#13;
had different areas.    How are you going to coordinate this?       It was&#13;
                                                                                with so many countries. and economic reports were thoroughly discussed&#13;
coordinated through an Economic Comâ&#128;¢ittee which was chaired from the&#13;
                                                                                and argued about in the Economic Committee.        It was very much an&#13;
economic staff. but the economic staff did not have all that much&#13;
                                                                                educational procedure. but it was not a strong coordinating mechanism&#13;
prestige, and the chair didn't have all that much clout. so the&#13;
                                                                                at all.&#13;
coordination took place more on the basis of the interchange of ideas&#13;
                                                                                OLDTER:     As Economic Advisor to Europe. did you sit on the Economic&#13;

approaches, somebody from the center bad to say, after considering&#13;
                                                                                KAMARCK: Oh yes.     Economic Advisors. were   ~   officio members of the&#13;
both. let us do it this way.&#13;
                                                                                Economic Committee.     The Economic Committee was made up of the Head of&#13;
OLLTER:    What time period are you talking about now?     The Black era?&#13;
                                                                                Economic staff and the economic advisors from the different area&#13;
KAHARCK:    The Black era. toward the end.    This is getting on toward the&#13;
                                                                                departments.&#13;

0Ln7ER:    Was there an Economic Committee R!! ! ! straight through from&#13;
                                                                                Economic Committee between the end of the Black administration and the&#13;
the beginning of the Bank?&#13;
                                                                                early years of the Woods administration?&#13;
KAHARCK:    That I don't know.     I came in 1950 and in 1952 the&#13;
                                                                                l&lt;AHARCK:    Well. there !!.!..! a change. there was an important change.&#13;
reorganization took place.       As a part of the reorganization. a Loan&#13;
                                                                                Once the Economics Department got set up under Woods. the Economic&#13;
Canmittee and an Economic Committee were set up.       The Economic&#13;
                                                                                Committee changed in this respect: it was put on more of a par with the&#13;
Committee was supposed to deal with creditworthiness and the Loan&#13;
                                                                                Loan Committee.     Before that. the Head of the Economic Committee was&#13;
Committee was to deal with loan operations.       The Head of the Economic&#13;
                                                                                also a member of the Loan Committee.       BUt that was all.   After that.&#13;
Committee was on the Loan Committee. but the Econamic Committee was&#13;
                                                                                the department director had to come to a meeting of the Economic&#13;
supposed to look at a country before the Loan Committee got to it.&#13;
                                                                                Committee when one of his countries was going to be discussed.           So you&#13;
OLnTER:    Was the head of the Economic Committee also the Chairman of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 9                                                                             10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had the head of area operations as well as the economic advisor on the          to be done about the economics side, and a couple of things were&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee.      Before that, the Economic Committee was clearly        attempted.    The economics staff at a certain point was renamed the&#13;
&#13;
regarded as subordinate to the Loan eo..ittee.       In the Woods era, it       Econoaic Department, but no director was appointed for it.     John De&#13;
&#13;
was not.                                                                        Wilde was made the acting director at one point, but, after awhile, he&#13;
&#13;
&lt;Lli/ER:    May I jâ&#128;¢p ahead and then coae back to where we are?        I have   beca.e fed up with it and asked to be reassigned back to an area&#13;
&#13;
discovered that the minutes of the Economic Co.mittee, which presumably         department.   Then Drag Avramovic. who had been head of the commodities&#13;
&#13;
were taken throughout the Woods years, seea to have been discarded.             staff. was aade acting director.     BUt it was a department more in&#13;
&#13;
Have you any notion as to haw this caae about?                                  embryo, more in concept, then reality because there was no expansion.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK      This is a complete surprise to me.                                 There were no slots allotted it.     They weren't allowed to build up.&#13;
&#13;
OLIII ER:   There were minutes kept to your knowledge?                          There vas no permanent head. It vas a temporary thing.      This went on&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Oh yes.                                                            for quite a while --     I forget bow long.   It was at least a couple of&#13;
&#13;
a..NER:     Would they have been kept by a secretary of the staff or a          years. maybe three years.    There was supposed to be a department there,&#13;
&#13;
professional â&#128;¢ember of the committee?                                           and there wasn't.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     We got a lllellber of the Secretary's Department.   The            OLNER:    This was after Leonard Rist had beca.e Special Advisor on&#13;
&#13;
Secretary's Department bad a responsibility to provide â&#128;¢â&#128;¢                       Africa.&#13;
&#13;
OLNBR:      There is a llBn named Clifford Owen.                                KAMARCK: That's right.    He vent to Black and suggested that he be made&#13;
KAKARCK:     Yes, be was the secretary during that period.                      Director of the Economic Department. and Black refused. He just kept&#13;
&#13;
OLIIIER:    Well, I'll continue my search for the minutes, though I think       him as Special Ambassador to Africa.     I think Black was sure that&#13;
&#13;
they are gone.                                                                  something had to be done. and Rist was not the answer.&#13;
&#13;
KAKARCK:     Really?                                                                 As   I mentioned to you earlier. Willard Thorpe of the Development&#13;
&#13;
OLIII ER:   To come back to where we were, you were about to tell about         Advisory Committee (DAC) of OECD was in Paris.     That committee was&#13;
&#13;
how the econa.ics work evolved in the Woods administration.                     trying to get the industralized countries to do more for the less&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Yes.   Well. let me first tell you why Woods decided to set up     developed countries.     It was quite clear in their minds that more&#13;
&#13;
a central Economics Department.      It was pretty clear by the time Black      economic work had to be done on the less developed countries -- that&#13;
&#13;
finished his administration and Woods was coming in that something had          this would help to get the industralized countries to do more and to do&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  11                                                                                12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a better job of it.     There had to be an economics staff somewhere.             used to explain why it didn't lend aore.      It didn't lend more because.&#13;
&#13;
Thorpe talked to me and asked me to pass this word back to the Bank and           in fact. we couldn't find good projects for more.         We were lending as&#13;
&#13;
I did.     He thought there should be at least 20 to 25 more economists           much as we could find good projects for.      The truth also was that Bank&#13;
&#13;
doing economics work in the Bank.       They should be doing senior               lending. with ups and downs. was steadily increasing in real terms;            it&#13;
economics work on the problema of economic development.        If the Bank        was probably going up at something like 9 or 10 percent per year.         It&#13;
&#13;
didn't do it. it was going to be built up somewhere else.         He passed       was a substantial rate of growth. but we started from 0.&#13;
&#13;
this back through me.     I wrote a â&#128;¢eaorandua on this samettae in the            a..N ER:   Some have suggested that the advent of IDA made an enormous&#13;
&#13;
early '60s.                                                                       difference in this regard. since that substantially changed the concept&#13;
&#13;
OLnTER:     You were not yet Chairman of the Economics DepartRent?                of creditworthiness.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK: No. this was before.     I was still in the Africa Department.           KAMARCK: Oh yes. it did.      It made a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
OLJYER:     Can you elaborate on what sort of things Thorpe in particular.        OLJYER:    Maybe this was about the time that Willard Thorpe and others&#13;
&#13;
but others also. may have felt the Bank ought to be doing and was not             were urging that there ought to be an expansion and a rethinking of the&#13;
&#13;
doing?                                                                            concept of creditworthiness.     This would have been during 1960.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well. I don't think I can be terribly specific.      In general.     KAMARCK: 1960.    When IDA came in. it wasn't clear it was going to make&#13;
&#13;
what he was talking about. if I reaember correctly. was just that there           a big difference.     This was one of the things that we discussed in the&#13;
&#13;
ought to be more work done on the problems of the developing countries.           EconaDic Committee:    On what basis did you decide that a country was an&#13;
&#13;
on what ought to be done to improve their economic performance.           There   IDA country. and on what basis did you decide it is a Bank country? How&#13;
&#13;
ought to be studies on creditworthiness.      How do you assess                   did you draw the line between them?      We went over that. and we came up&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness? What are the kinds of assistance that these countries           with a poverty criteria and a performance criteria. and then we talked&#13;
&#13;
need?     How should aid be extended?   On what terms?   There was some           about blends; but all of this required economic analysis and economic&#13;
&#13;
question as to what amounts of assistance they could absorb.           At that    judgement. so that it was quite clear there were a lot of problems to&#13;
&#13;
time the prevailing theory was that the amount of the assistance that             be worked on.&#13;
&#13;
was then available to the developing countries was just about what they           OLNBR:     It was quite clear that there was a substantial push for more&#13;
&#13;
could absorb.     There was no point in providing more. because in fact           economics work even before Hr. Woods became President of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
the absorptive capacity wasn't there.      This was the theme that the Bank       KAHARCK:    Oh yes. oh yes.    When Woods became President (it must have&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              13                                                                                  14&#13;

been his first speech to the staff). be said that one of the things           off to UCLA that he was coming to the Bank.        They had brought in Ed&#13;
&#13;
that he wanted to do was to build the economic work in the Bank.         He   Mason to advise.        (That was probably Dick Demuth's suggestion.     Ed Mason&#13;
&#13;
had this habit. Woods did. of aaking a statement.     He would lean back      had been recruited by Dick Demuth for the Uganda Survey Mission. and&#13;
&#13;
and push his glasses up over his eyebrows on top of his head. and then        this was regarded as one of the more successful missions.)          There should&#13;
he would come out with a caaplete frank. blunt statement.     He did it       be a msorandum in the files somewhere about Ed Mason's advice.&#13;
&#13;
this time.     He said. of course. that basically Black was frightened of     &lt;LN ER:     I think I have seen a memorandum recommending very much the&#13;
&#13;
econaaiats. WSUt I'm not.â&#128;¢ or aa-ething of this kind.     He indicated        same sort of thing you have attributed to Willard Thorpe.           Before we&#13;
that Black was aware of the fact that something needed to be done. and        get back to the more general discussion of the economic work and your&#13;
&#13;
he certainly was aware that something needed to be done. and he was           own role in directing the Economics Department. I wonder if there is&#13;
&#13;
going to propose to do something.                                             anything you would care to say about Irving Friedmanâ&#128;¢ s general tenure&#13;
&#13;
CLN ER:    What in fact did be do?                                            in office as the Economic Advisor.        What sort of thrusts did he suggest&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     I'm not quite sure that I really understand the sequence         and how did he get on with the various people in the Bank?          What did&#13;
&#13;
because. right around this time. I went off to UCLA.     What I have been     the various people in the Bank feel about this large expansion in the&#13;
&#13;
told since then was that he asked around for suggestions as to whom be        economics staff?&#13;
&#13;
should put at the top of the economics work.     He asked people like the     KAHARCK:     Complex.     First of all. the Bank was a bit of a closed shop.&#13;
&#13;
British. he asked different government people. and he got                     By this tiae. practically all the senior people were people who had&#13;
recommendations fraa a lot of thea that he ought to try to recruit            come up in the Bank. and somebody was being brought in from the outside&#13;
&#13;
Irving Friedman from the Fund -- at least this is what I have been            at a high level.        At various times in the earlier history of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
told.                                                                         before this time. people were brought in at a high level. and almost&#13;
0Ln7ER:    Irving Friedman came to the Bank in the summer of 1964.            inevitably this had failed.        I can't think of an exception.    They would&#13;
&#13;
KAHARCK:     It must have been either late summer or early fall.   I'm        be brought in to head up the Projects Department. to head up an area&#13;
&#13;
trying to recall. but I can't remember.     I think I had talked to him       department. or something of that kind.        Either they didn't have the&#13;
&#13;
very briefly before I went off to UCLA.     I'm not sure whether it           experience or the judgement or whatever it was to live up to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
had been announced that he was coming to the Bank or he told me he was        and there was a tendency on the part of the Bank people to gang up&#13;
&#13;
coming to the Bank.     I've forgotten exactly. but I knew before I went      again~t    the outsider.    You had that very strong element in the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   15                                                                                  16&#13;

trying to move up and cutting other people down.       I reaember Peter                between the projects and the area departments.     In that way. they would&#13;
&#13;
Cargill telling ae at one time (I'a not sure when) â&#128;¢ "I've knifed a lot                be sure a proper job was going to be done.)     Woods. realizing that. or&#13;
&#13;
of people in my time at the Bank.     I've got no qualms about it. â&#128;¢â&#128;¢        'l'bere   having been told that, said that conflict used to be between the area&#13;
is a lot of that in the Bank.                                                          departaents and Project Departaent.     Now it is going to be between the&#13;
&#13;
     So. first of all. Irving was an outsider. and secondly. Bank                      Econaaics Department and the rest of the Bank.     He though this was&#13;
&#13;
people have a tendency to compete among the11.selves.     (We fight amongst            good. or partly good.   He didn't think it was always good.&#13;
&#13;
ourselves. but when it coaes to an outsider at a high level. we are                         At one point. I tried to set up. and partially succeeded in&#13;
&#13;
going to unite against hi.U.    '!'ben there is the fact that Irving caae              setting up. a system whereby the area department directors and I&#13;
&#13;
from the Fund. and relationships between the Bank and the Fund are not                 lunched together regularly once a month as a matter of cooperation.            I&#13;
&#13;
all that good most of the time.     There are exceptions. but most of the              mentioned this to Woods. and he thought this was a wonderful idea.&#13;
&#13;
Bank people don't think much of the Fund people. and moat of the Fund                  What I didn't tell Woods was that most of the area department directors&#13;
&#13;
people don't think much of the Bank people.                                            refused to come to the lunch.     Jerry Alter would come.   Bernie Bell.&#13;
&#13;
OLJYER:    Do you think that is still true?    Are you saying that today?              when he became head of the Projects Department. would come.          Peter&#13;
&#13;
KAMARO::   My guess is that it is still true.      I don't know.        I would be     Cargill definitely never would.     Raymond Cope never would.    They didn't&#13;
&#13;
very much surprised if it weren't true.       You had that element too.                want to work out a system of cooperation.     They preferred a system of&#13;
&#13;
Consequently. when Irving caae. be c8111e into an environment in which                 conflict.   This didn't mean that we couldn't work together.         Raymond&#13;
&#13;
people were not going to go out of their way to cooperate with him.              In    Cope and I had a long history of association. Peter Cargill and I got&#13;
&#13;
fact. if they could do it without too much harm to themselves. they                    along as well as with most people in the Bank.     But they certainly&#13;
&#13;
were going to do their best to do him in.       There is just no question              weren't going to have any kind of formal or informal system of lunches&#13;
&#13;
about that. no question about that.                                                    where you talk about problems and work them out.     This was the&#13;
&#13;
     This didn 1 t bother George Woods.   George Woods expressed at a                  kind Of environment that Irving came into.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     17                                                                                      18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In all this. I had several roles.      Irving did not have a                       had had experience during World War II when I had built up several&#13;
&#13;
background in the Bank; I had a background in the Bank. so I could                      organizations in a hurry. like the Control Council in Get1Dany. and&#13;
&#13;
provide that in the set up.      Irving is confrontational. basically. and              later in the Treasury. so that creating an organization in a hurry.&#13;
&#13;
I sa not.     The approach that I had in administration was to try. if                  throwing it together. recruiting people never bothered me.            That is&#13;
&#13;
there is a dispute. to see whether or not we could work out an                          scaething else that I could do.&#13;
&#13;
agreement where everybody vas going to be reasonably happy so we could                  01.111 ER:    Hay I ask one last question about Irving Friedman'I      Same have&#13;
&#13;
cooperate in the future rather than to be battling over it.            Very             suggested that some people in the Fund were glad to see him go to the&#13;
&#13;
often. if you have the interest of the country or the Bank at heart.                    Bank.        Is this a rumor that you have heard'l&#13;
&#13;
you can work something out.      In a sense. I was there partly to smooth               KAMARCK:        It is not only a rumor. I think it is true.      In the Fund&#13;
&#13;
things out.     Irving was an old friend of aine.   Whereas a lot of people             there were people who had been in conflict with him from the very&#13;
                             1&#13;
who worked for Irving didn t trust him and wouldn    1&#13;
                                                         t    apeak frankly to          beginning.        Eddie Bernstein. who had been head of the Research&#13;
&#13;
bia. aoaetiaes hoping that would get hia into trouble.            as far as I was       Departaent. and Irving were involved in an early fight in the Fund.              I&#13;
&#13;
concerned. I never had any problem about disagreeing with Irving.                If I   think Irving was absolutely on the right side.            Bernstein represented.&#13;
&#13;
thought he was doing wrong. I would tell hiâ&#128;¢ so.                                        more or less. the British point of view. whereas Irving. with the help&#13;
&#13;
     I never bad any probleas with Irving.     He realized I had his                    of Andy Overby. represented the American.            The British and Bernstein's&#13;
&#13;
interests at heart. so I had no proble. in that respect.            Also. I'm a         point of view was. more or less. that the Fund was there for a country&#13;
&#13;
fairly good adainistrator. and Irving is a terrible adainistrator.                      to draw on whenever it felt it needed it;            whereas Irving's and Andy&#13;
&#13;
Irving is very creative.     Like George Woods. he has a creative aind.                 Overby's point of view-- the U. S. Treasury's point of view most of&#13;
&#13;
He's an innovator.    He's not afraid to kick aver apple carts.           It            the time -- was that the Fund was there         to provide resources. yes. but&#13;
&#13;
doesn't bother hia to come up with an idea that is going to completely                  it was also there to improve the performance of the borrowing country&#13;
&#13;
disrupt all the existing work and change everybody's assignments or                         _!Â£   .!h!,! aid   ~    be conditioned.&#13;
&#13;
pull them off assignments or wreck what they are doing if there is                              There was a terrific battle on that in the Fund. very. very&#13;
&#13;
something that he thinks is :iaportant to be done.           All tba t is very          bitter. and Irving's point of view largely won.            If the other point of&#13;
&#13;
valuable.     But you need somebody alongside of somebody like that to                  view had won. the Fund would have been out of existence a long time&#13;
&#13;
hold the organization together.     That was a large part of zy job.             I      ago.      This was a major contribution that Irving made. but he made a lot&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 19                                                                                 20&#13;

more eneaiea than be needed to. but. nevertheless. it was for a good               Australia. $100 million. there was very little discussion of policies&#13;
&#13;
substantive issue: and be was on the right side of it. It may also be              or anything of this kind.      Black had committed himself to considering&#13;
&#13;
that if he had not been confrontational to the extent that he was                  a aeries of loans totaling $250 million. the idea being $50 million a&#13;
&#13;
willing to do battle. he might not have won: it is perfectly possible              year.     When the third tranche of $50 million came up. we had our first&#13;

in part because he wanted the Bank to have aore authority in sugsesting            ccmpletely forgotten.     During World War II. the economic system of the&#13;

&#13;
if that point of view is about to be reestablished.                                where it went and what it had to carry.     You had a War Production Board&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     This is a difficult one.   This is a very difficult one.        The   that controlled what was going to be produced:        certain nu.bers and&#13;

Loans.      I was. for a long time. on the aide that argued that the Bank          on.     The economy was thoroughly planned. thoroughly supervised by the&#13;
&#13;
should be involved and have a great deal to say about policies -- that             government.     Exchange controls controlled everything in the balance-of-&#13;

financial perfor.ance of a country.      In the early years of the Black                   At the end of the war. the United States disbanded controls&#13;
&#13;
era. there was a substantial aaount of that point of view.         I'm not         immediately -- within six months or so. everything went.        Some of the&#13;
&#13;
sure to what extent it appears in the records. and I can only testify              other countries held on for a longer time.     Some    countries were trying&#13;
&#13;
to what I was involved in.      (I was not involved in Latin American              to hold on to controls when the rest of the world was uncontrolled.&#13;
&#13;
lending at all.     A certain amount of this took place in Latin America.          They were using controls when there was no longer popular support for&#13;
&#13;
but I really can't talk about that.)                                               them and when they hadn't really thought out what they were doing with&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the contrOls.   So a very iaportant aspect of what the Bank did in those     different government enterprises.     The guy who was head of INI was an&#13;
&#13;
early years was to get countries to dia.antle these controls.      This is   old childhood friend of Franco's.     We visited a shipyard in southern&#13;
&#13;
one of the things we did in Australia.    We did it in Norway.               Spain.     The shipyard was up a river.   To get a ship down the river to&#13;
&#13;
     In Australia. before we loaned the third tranche. there was a lot       the sea was a aajor undertaking.     The river practically wasn't big&#13;
&#13;
of talk back and forth between the Bank and Australia.     The Australians   enough.     You had this kind of thing all over the place.   This guy. with&#13;
&#13;
insisted that we not make it a condition; but we did aake it a               terrific losses in all his enterprises. bad no probleas. because&#13;
&#13;
condition. they also made it clear to us that they were going to change      whenever he wanted money he just went to the central bank.      Franco told&#13;
&#13;
the fiscal policy. they were going to change aCIDe of their investment       the central bank. "Give him whatever money he wants."&#13;
&#13;
policy.   They said. we're going to do this. and we're telling you.                 You bad latent inflation built up under a whole series of controls&#13;
&#13;
We're not doing this because of your conditions. we're telling you.          that creaked corruption and everything else.     When we came back. we&#13;
&#13;
     A similar sort of thing happened when Spain joined the Bank.            reported this to Black.     He wrote to Franco. "No loans until you&#13;
&#13;
Dick Deeuth and Ernesto Franco and I were on the first aisaion.     One      liberalize the economy."     The Fund then was doing the same thing.     OECD&#13;
&#13;
of the first things we soon discovered was that Spain wasn't going to        was doing the same thing.     There was a lot of that done in the early&#13;
&#13;
get anywhere because they not only had the wartime controls. they had        years.     But as the years went by. there was less and leas of that done.&#13;
&#13;
fascist types of controls.   Every industry was supposed to be a kind               The Projects Department became larger and larger and more and more&#13;
&#13;
of corporation. and the heads of the corporations were in Italian-type       influencial.     The Bank still had impact. but it had to be a more&#13;
&#13;
corporate states.   A textile aanufacturer in Barcelona couldn't export      infonaal impact.     It came in the course of conversation. rather than in&#13;
&#13;
without getting approval fro. Madrid.     If he got an order. by the timeÂ·   the for. of making it clear to a government that it didn't change. it&#13;
&#13;
he got approval. the custoaer was gone.    The exchange rate was             wasn't going to get any money.     It was more on the basis of trying to&#13;
&#13;
completely wrong: the black market in foreign exchange was almost the        educate goverr:ments.    "Other governments are doing this and it's paid&#13;

up with things like the following. for example.     There was an             sector. â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ By doing this in enough sectors. you are going to have an&#13;
&#13;
organization called INI, which was modeled on IRI in Italy. which owned      impact. but it wasn't formal.&#13;

KAHARCK:      It was a micro-sector. a little bit on the macro discussion                    ask Irving not to do it.       We probably did discuss it (we discussed a&#13;

side.      Less and leas did the econoaista do it.                                           lot of things) â&#128;¢ but I backed away frc.. it. because we had been building&#13;

to impr011e savings.     You are going to have a need for additional                         ct.NER:      I take it that there was acme effort. at least. to get all of&#13;
&#13;
resources from abroad.        We will asree to ..!.!:I ..!Â£   ~   .!1!2!.!   resources for   the advisors to attend meetings of the Economic Caamittee.&#13;
&#13;
~   providing    ~   .Â£!!!I   ~    those policies.      We. of course. will have.            KAMARCK:     There was no problem on that.     They had been members of the&#13;
&#13;
as in the Fund. consultations each year to aake sure that you are                            Economic Caamittee before.&#13;
&#13;
following the policies.â&#128;¢        That was the idea behind it.                                 Ct.N ER:     I suppose that acme of the economic advisors may have presuned&#13;
&#13;
        The scheae never went through.        As the years went by. moreover. I              that they had a better chance to rise to become heads of          areas&#13;
&#13;
became leas convinced that this sort of thing would be a good idea. and                      departllents if they stayed where they were.&#13;
&#13;
less convinced that you could do it in the Bank.                To do it in the Bank.        KAKARCK: No.&#13;
&#13;
you'd practically have to recruit a new staff.                We thought in terms of         OLN ER:     As did happen to some of thEm.&#13;
&#13;
(Woods would have given it to us if we had asked) all the area                               KAMARCK:     Did it2   Well it did to Jerry Alter. but Jerry Alter became&#13;
&#13;
economists being assigned to the Economics Department and seconded to                        head Of his department fairly early on.        I think he became head of a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     25                                                                                26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
department even before the Economics Department was set up.               Jerry         painful.&#13;
&#13;
Alter did become bead of a depart.ent. but the other econaaic advisors                  OLNER:     1 1 m sorry to say we've come to the end of the tape.    Perhaps&#13;
&#13;
did not want to become      heads of their departments.      What had happened          we can do another after lunch.     In any event. thank you for this&#13;
&#13;
over the years is that you bad had. in a sense. a selection.               Those        morning.&#13;
&#13;
economists who wanted to get into operations did.           (Actually. most of&#13;
&#13;
the operations depara.ents were beaded by people who had been&#13;
&#13;
econa.ists.)      BUt the people who were econaaic advisors.                 This was&#13;
&#13;
true of me. I did not want to spend my tiae in loan negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
worrying about loan contracts and whether the prodects people had&#13;
&#13;
prepared the projects report or the lawyers had prepared a contract.&#13;
&#13;
The people who    ~     econOIDic advison   ~     people who did .!!Â£!. want .!5!:&#13;
&#13;
become loan officers, they     ~      to do economics.&#13;
&#13;
     The difference between â&#128;¢e and â&#128;¢oat of the other econaaic advisors&#13;
&#13;
was that    th~   were quite happy to be economic advisors in the&#13;
&#13;
operations depart.ents.      It was one of the most interesting jobs in the&#13;
&#13;
world, one of the beat jobs in the world actually.           They were quite&#13;
&#13;
content with that.      As far as I was concerned, I did want to go on to&#13;
&#13;
the macro thing.      When the chance came of putting economic advisors in&#13;
&#13;
the Econaaics Depart.ent, I decided against it because I had so many&#13;
&#13;
other things to do.      Also I didn't think these guys were the guys we&#13;
&#13;
were going to do macro policy with.         We would have bad to do what to&#13;
&#13;
some extent we did do.      We had to reshuffle some of the economic&#13;
&#13;
advisors.    For example, Harold Larsen, who had been an economic advisor&#13;
&#13;
for a long time.      We down graded him, because, able guy and all the&#13;
&#13;
rest of it, he didn't do the kind of work we wanted, and it was&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In November 1985, Andrew Kamarck was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver for the George Woods
            biography. During his tenure at the Bank from 1950 to 1979,
            Mr. Kamarck worked in the following areas: as an economic
            advisor in the departments of operations for Europe, Africa,
            and Australasia (1952-1962) and for Africa (1962-1965); as a
            director for the economics department (1965-1971) and for
            the Economics Development Institute (EDI) (1972-1977); and
            as a senior fellow for EDI (1977-1979). His transcript
            concerns the reorganization of the World Bank in 1952 when
            the loan and economic departments merged. Economic advisors
            did not want to become loan officers.
