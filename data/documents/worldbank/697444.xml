basic transportation infrastructure consists of 86,000 km of rail network operated by 19&#13;
regionally autonomous railway administrations, 453,000 km of public roadsl, 300,000 km of oil&#13;
and gas distribution pipelines, and 100,000 km of waterways. Despite thinly developed transport&#13;
networks, the Russian Federation has the most freight-transport-intensive economy in the world,&#13;
even after the recent drops in traffic. The transport ton-kilometer per US dollar equivalent of&#13;
GDP in the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the late 1980s has been estimated to be nearly six&#13;
times that of the USA and over four times that of Canada. Road density is slightly above the&#13;
average for middle income economies and road freight transport is provided by Russia's roughly&#13;
3 million trucks, of which about 1,500,000 belong to state farms and other agricultural&#13;
enterprises. The railways, the most densely used in the world, accounted for 71 percent of total&#13;
freight traffic in 1992, excluding pipelines, while roads accounted for about 8 percent, river and&#13;
sea 21 percent.&#13;
1.2        The fiscal impact of the transport sector in Russia is enormous and increasing&#13;
rapidly, although responsibility for supporting the sector is moving from the Federal to the oblast&#13;
and local levels. Costs, particularly fuel, are rising rapidly, but revenues are declining, both&#13;
because of lower traffic volumes and the time lag between cost and tariff increases. Explicit&#13;
subsidies to transport for operating losses represented 11 percent of Russia's total budgeted&#13;
subsidy payments in 1992, roughly equivalent to two percent of GDP. The operating deficits of&#13;
urban transport companies were estimated to be roughly six percent of GDP in 1993.&#13;
1.3        Passenger Transport. Passenger transport is provided by public enterprises in&#13;
Russia, with buses carrying the most passengers for primarily short distances, while rail carries&#13;
the greatest passenger-kilometer (pass-km). The railways carried about 42 percent of total non-&#13;
urban passenger traffic in 1990 (417 billion pass-km) while buses carried about 27 percent (268&#13;
billion pass-km). Because much of its population is urbanized and private ownership of cars has&#13;
been discouraged - private car ownership is very low with about 6 cars per 100 inhabitants, as&#13;
compared to over 40 in Western Europe. Russia has the third largest public transport fleet in the&#13;
world. The fleet is estimated to carry 90 percent of all urban motorized person-trips. Russia has&#13;
been highly dependent upon air service due to its vast distances and governmental policy of&#13;
maintaining extremely low air fares; airlines account for about 22 percent of total non-urban&#13;
I.   There are an additional 0.45 million km of agricultural and enterprise roads, some of which should be re-classified as public&#13;
roads.&#13;
&#13;

2                                                                                    Chapter I&#13;
transport. However, already air traffic has declined sharply over the past two years because of&#13;
the increase in air fares; this trend is expected to continue as fares are set closer to international&#13;
fares. Road passenger transport is expected to more than double over the next ten years.2&#13;
1.4         Passenger Demand. Passenger travel is expected to respond to changes in income&#13;
levels and changes in relative prices. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (EBRD) consultants' forecast, "given constant prices, the overall passenger market&#13;
is expected to grow at the rate of growth of the economy with longer distance travel growing&#13;
somewhat faster and short-distance travel growing somewhat slower. Real price changes would&#13;
similarly affect long-distance trips more than short-distance trips.", The forecasts also take into&#13;
account suppressed passenger demand within Russia and the FSU (Figure 1.1) and assume no&#13;
intermodal distortions regarding tariff patterns or subsidies. In fact, the government is&#13;
increasingly subsidizing passenger transport,&#13;
although the subsidy is buried in support to local        Figure 1.1 PASSENGER DEMAND&#13;
and regional budgets since responsibility  for                   (1980 to 2007)&#13;
urban transport has devolved to local authorities.&#13;
Responsibility for covering the cost of suburban&#13;
commuter  rail transport has  been  left  to           Billion P.as.enger km&#13;
individual railways to cross subsidize with freight   °°&#13;
traffic,  although   individual  railways   are      2000&#13;
encouraged to raise local commuter rail fares in&#13;
consultation  with  municipal authorities. The&#13;
political climate for implementing such price&#13;
increases may vary from place to place and thus&#13;
could  introduce   intermodal  distortions.          MO&#13;
Nonetheless, even  if there were real price               _&#13;
increases for some modes, passenger traffic              1950   1990   loa  Medium   Hilgh&#13;
demand is expected to grow significantly given          U Ril   eus Car 0 Air [Z] All non-Rail&#13;
the past level of suppressed demand.&#13;
1.5        Organization.  The  Ministry  of&#13;
Transport (MOT) was established in 1992 out of&#13;
the remains of the former Ministry of Automobile Transport. The Ministry is divided into seven&#13;
offices each headed by a Deputy Minister, including an Interdepartmental Coordinating Council&#13;
on Transport and Advisory Council, plus six modal transport departments headed by First&#13;
Deputy Ministers, including aviation, maritime, waterways, highways, automotive transport, and&#13;
railways. Urban transport comes under the responsibility of the Department of Automobile&#13;
Transport. MOT has been given responsibility for transport policy and coordination for all&#13;
modes of transport in Russia, but the Ministry of Railways (which oversaw all aspects of railway&#13;
operations prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union) remains in existence by governmental&#13;
decree and still exercises full control over the railways.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
Il. URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. URBAN SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1        The Russian Federation, with a land area of 17.1 million square kilometers, is by&#13;
far the largest country in the world, stretching across 11 time zones. Russia is a highly urbanized&#13;
country with 74 percent (108.8 million) of its 1991 population of 146.8 million living in urban&#13;
areas. More than 1,800 urban settlements are served by bus transport. It has the fourth largest&#13;
urban population in the world: only China, India, and the USA have larger urban populations.&#13;
Russia is also experiencing one of the highest paces of urbanization in the world: during the ten&#13;
year period, 1979-89, the country experienced a 14 percent increase (14.1 million) in urban&#13;
population while experiencing a 10 percent drop (4.3 million) in rural population'. These&#13;
urbanization trends are expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Migration to the cities is&#13;
likely to increase as the country moves to a market economy, restrictions on places of residence&#13;
are lifted, and migration from other republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) to Russian cities&#13;
continues. Despite the high level of urbanization, there is less urban concentration in large cities&#13;
than in Western Europe and the USA, since only 26 percent of the urban population live in cities&#13;
with over a million people, and nearly 40 percent of these live in Moscow and St. Petersburg.&#13;
In addition, Russia's population, including its cities, is concentrated in the area west of the Ural&#13;
Mountains.&#13;
2.2       Decentralization of Public Expenditure. Intergovernmental fiscal relations in the&#13;
Russian Federation are complicated by the lack of legal regulation governing fiscal relationships&#13;
among governmental units. Consistent with political reforms to decentralize authority, the past&#13;
two years have witnessed a dramatic decentralization of the responsibility for public expenditure&#13;
in Russia. Prior to 1991, nearly all investment in public infrastructure was under the control of&#13;
the central Government but since then most public sector investments and services have been&#13;
made the responsibility of regional and local authorities. According to the new Constitution, the&#13;
federal Government retains responsibility only for monetary policy, federal transport and power&#13;
systems, and federally-subordinated enterprises and banks. In 1993, about 80 percent of public&#13;
expenditures on social services were at the sub-national level.&#13;
2.3        Although the policy to decentralize has many positive features, devolution of&#13;
expenditure responsibility to regional governments has not been accompanied by an adequate&#13;
transfer of fiscal revenues. Despite the passage of a law on basic taxation in early 1992, the&#13;
1.   During this period the population of Russia increased 9.8%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                            Chapter I&#13;
system still relies on the Soviet model of sharing most of the major tax revenue collected. This&#13;
system involves a process of iterative negotiations between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and&#13;
the departments of finance of the oblasts, autonomous regions, krais, okrugs and, in some cases,&#13;
municipalities, with politically stronger regional and local governments managing to retain a&#13;
larger share of the revenues collected. Local taxes collected by regional governments generally&#13;
account for only about 5-10 percent of their revenues, compared to 50-90 percent in OECD&#13;
countries. Public finance is further constrained by the regional and municipal governments'&#13;
inability to borrow given the immaturity of financial markets and the high and variable inflation&#13;
rates which make term financing risky for both lenders and borrowers.&#13;
2.4        A key aspect of the Russian administrative system  is that only oblast-level&#13;
governments are subjects of the Federation. By contrast, local governments - municipalities and&#13;
rayons - are "subjects" of the oblast government, not of the federal Government. Despite recent&#13;
laws designed to establish a standard sphere of authority and responsibility for local&#13;
governments, the powers of local governments are still determined primarily by each oblast.&#13;
Local governments have practically no fiscal independence, as their budgets must be approved&#13;
by the oblast government. As a result, the powers of local governments vary considerably across&#13;
oblasts - and even within oblasts - although larger municipalities tend to have a larger measure&#13;
of independence.&#13;
B. URBAN TRANSPORT CHARAcTERISTICS&#13;
2.5        With 75 percent of its population living in urban areas and low car ownership,&#13;
Russia is more dependent upon public transport services than any other nation with a similar&#13;
level of income. In 1991, urban and suburban transport by bus, tram, and trolleybus carried 41.8&#13;
billion passengers, representing about 85 percent of passenger transportation by all modes. This&#13;
compares to an urban transport share of overall public transport in Western Europe of about 20&#13;
percent, and in the United States of about 3 percent. If public transport companies do not work&#13;
well, then neither do Russia's cities, households, factories, offices, schools, or stores.&#13;
2.6       Russian cities are served by a variety of passenger services. Bus services are&#13;
provided in 1,854 urban settlements throughout the Federation. Some form of electric-powered&#13;
transport service is provided in 101 cities, including 85 cities with a trolleybus network and 70&#13;
cities with a tram network. Five major cities are served by a subway or metro system and&#13;
commiuter rail service is important for the suburbs of the larger Russian cities, especially&#13;
Moscow and St. Petersburg. Overall, bus services account for an estimated 64.4 percent of all&#13;
urban passenger trips; trolleybuses and trams 18.5 percent; metros 7.8 percent; suburban rail&#13;
7 percent; and taxis and small buses 2.3 percent.&#13;
2.7       There are an estimated 300,000 buses in Russia, of which 131,000 are in fleets&#13;
providing regularly scheduled services (of which 26,000 serve intercity routes). The remaining&#13;
169,000 are predominantly owned by enterprises and other entities that provide services to their&#13;
employees. Approximately 80 percent of the publicly-owned buses provide regularly scheduled&#13;
urban and suburban service; 20 percent are in intercity service. In addition there are&#13;
approximately 15,000 trams and 14,000 trolleybuses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II                                                                        5&#13;
2.8       Despite the large size of the urban transport fleet, it is relatively small given&#13;
Russia's high dependence on public transport. The fleet currently averages slightly over one&#13;
vehicle per thousand population, including a large percentage of vehicles currently not&#13;
operational. The operating fleet is considerably lower than the operating fleets in the four major&#13;
European Union (EU) countries where automobiles and other personal means of transport are&#13;
much more widespread, indicating the lower number of passenger trips per day. As a result, the&#13;
degree of personal mobility in Russian cities is considerably lower than in Western European&#13;
and other developed nations. This has an enormous impact on labor efficiency.&#13;
2.9       In the last two or three years since the government began to limit the use of&#13;
critically needed foreign exchange for buying new buses, trolleys, and associated spare parts,&#13;
urban public transportation service has deteriorated sharply. More than a third of the current&#13;
urban bus and tram fleets have been manufactured mainly in Hungary and former&#13;
Czechoslovakia but since the breakup of the Eastern European trade block the cost of the buses&#13;
has increased rapidly to near world-market prices. Consequently, the number of Ikarus buses&#13;
imported from Hungary dropped from 3,100 in 1988 to a mere 120 in 1992 (according to MOT&#13;
filgures), compared to an estimated requirement of at least 2,000. Overall, the number of buses&#13;
received by Russia's transport carriers declined from 19,500 buses in 1985 to 9,320 in 1992;&#13;
these mostly domestically-produced buses were smaller, less fuel efficient, and less durable than&#13;
those imported from Hungary. Due to the low replacement rate of buses, an estimated one-third&#13;
of the fleet was beyond its economic life by the end of 1994. As a result, vehicles are already&#13;
being kept in operation well beyond their serviceable life. According to MOT, only about one-&#13;
half of Russia's demand for buses is now being met. Assistance for the subsector has already&#13;
been provided by the Bank under the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3513-RU) which financed about&#13;
US$41 million in spare parts for buses.&#13;
C. INsTITUTuoNAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
2.10      The urban public transport industry and its governmental institutions are, like&#13;
everything else in Russia, in transition. Under the former regime, the day to day activities of&#13;
most urban transport companies were controlled at the oblast government level, including all&#13;
aspects of urban transport operations; all urban transport budgets had to be approved by the&#13;
oblast. Urban transport companies were also involved in other activities, such as road transport,&#13;
taxi services, and inter-city bus services. The extent to which there have been changes in the&#13;
organization and control of urban passenger transport varies considerably from one oblast to&#13;
another. In many cases, the oblast has given control over day to day operations of urban&#13;
transport companies to municipal governments. In a few cities the process of divorcing transport&#13;
enterprises from the municipal government is well underway. Some urban transport companies&#13;
have divested themselves of non-urban passenger transport activities, although most still provide&#13;
taxi services. Nevertheless, whether urban transport operations are controlled at the municipal&#13;
level or not, oblast governments still have considerable influence over urban transport companies&#13;
because of their control over municipal budgets, which include financing of subsidies for urban&#13;
transport operations and acquisition of buses.&#13;

transport.                                Source: MOT, given to World Bank mission, November 1992&#13;
and June 1993. For railway estimate, Interfax Business&#13;
2.12        Prior to  1993, the federal  Report, No. 29 (432) 11 February 1993, p 3.&#13;
Government financed a large share of the   -&#13;
urban passenger operating losses, but now&#13;
most operating subsidies are financed by oblast and municipal governments (although the&#13;
majority of oblasts have received subventions from the federal Government to help cover overall&#13;
budget deficits). In 1994 there are no provisions for federal subsidies for urban transport.&#13;
Instead, a federal decree was issued (December 3, 1993) authorizing oblast governments to&#13;
institute and collect a one percent payroll tax to support urban transport losses. This tax is being&#13;
levied in the oblasts of some of the candidate cities but tax receipts are folded into oblast&#13;
government general revenues rather than earmarked directly to urban transport companies at the&#13;
local level. MOT estimated that local governments collected Rb120-130 billion from this special&#13;
urban transport tax in 1993. Without major efforts both to restructure Russia's transport&#13;
industries and enterprises and to reform and reorganize the government institutions that&#13;
administer and fund them, the gap between revenues and costs will continue to increase and put&#13;
increasing demands on the federal budget to subsidize transport operations.&#13;
2.13        Transport entities are experiencing a general decline in financial conditions caused&#13;
by rapid increases in costs, increasingly limited local government budget allocations available&#13;
for transport subsidies, and passenger fare evasion, presumably all caused by the overall decline&#13;
in economic conditions. About one-third of the population is legally exempt from paying any&#13;
fare2. An additional one-third of the population is apparently illegally evading payment of fares&#13;
- Moscow authorities reported that during the past year fares were tripled while collections only&#13;
increased 60 percent. Moreover, fares are set very low relative to costs. As a result, passengers&#13;
of most urban public transport systems are paying only 10-20 percent of total operating costs;&#13;
when capital costs are taken into account, passengers' share of costs covered by fares may be&#13;
2.   In some localities, additional exemptions enacted at the oblast and municipal level reportedly have brought exemptions&#13;
closer to 70-80% of the population.&#13;

Chapter II                                                                     7&#13;
as low as 5-10 percent. The municipalities (or oblasts in some cases) have been slow to release&#13;
funds to finance the urban transport companies' operating deficits so that companies have been&#13;
continually operating in a crisis situation.&#13;
E. URBAN PASSENGER TRANSPORT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY&#13;
2.14      Importing large numbers of vehicles for urban transport is really only a short to&#13;
medium term solution to Russia's ongoing urban transport vehicle replacement requirements.&#13;
Given its size and market, and the unlikelihood that urban transport services will be self-&#13;
financing for many years, it is important that municipalities be able to purchase good buses for&#13;
rubles at prices less than available for import. Unfortunately, the previous Government's&#13;
centralization and specialization policies resulted in the manufacture of buses being assigned to&#13;
members of the Soviet Union other than Russia.&#13;
2.15      The majority of standard and articulated urban transport buses were manufactured&#13;
in Hungary by Ikarus while buses assigned to suburban routes were manufactured for the most&#13;
part by Ikarus and the Lvov Bus Plant in Ukraine. Even before the breakup of the former USSR,&#13;
the number of buses manufactured decreased by 6.9 percent from the 1989 level of 90,618 to&#13;
84,380 in 1990. The Lvov plant, which specialized in medium-size intercity and local or rural&#13;
route buses, accounted for 14.5 percent of overall production. The Riga Bus Plant (in Latvia),&#13;
specialized in a line of minibus models and accounted for 20.3 percent of total 1990 bus&#13;
production.&#13;
2.16      Russian bus manufacturers include the Likino Bus Plant (LiAZ), which used to&#13;
manufacture 9-10 meter city buses (3,500 in 1993) which are smaller and a lower standard than&#13;
the imported Ikarus buses, but has now switched to production of a 12 meter buses; the Pavlovo&#13;
Bus plant (PAZ), which produces small-size buses (10,780 in 1993) and the Kurgan Plant&#13;
(KAvZ), a producer of small general purpose buses (5,720 in 1993). AvtoUAZ and KamAZ also&#13;
produce buses, and, respectively, accounted for 15 percent and 5.8 percent of overall bus&#13;
production in 1990. Two joint ventures have recently been established in Russia - AO RusScan&#13;
(Russian-Swedish) and GolAZ Golitzino (Russian - German) - both of whom produce 12 meter&#13;
buses; GolAZ also produces 18 meter buses. Domestic manufacturing capacity is not sufficient&#13;
to meet the demand for buses in Russia. The domestic trolleybus producer is the Uritskiy&#13;
Trolleybus Plant (ZIU) which produced 1,660 vehicles in 1993. Apart from the St.Petersburg&#13;
Tram and Trolley Bus Plant which only manufactures vehicles for its own needs, the only&#13;
supplier of trams is the Ust-Katav Wagon Repair Plant which produced 560 trams in 1993.&#13;
2.17      Even prior to the break-up of the FSU, Government intended to increase bus&#13;
production in the USSR under the auspices of the Avtrokon Concern, an association of bus and&#13;
trolleybus producers. Under this plan, three additional bus manufacturers were to be created:&#13;
Davydovka, Golistyno and Tula. Following the breakup of the FSU and in the wake of the lack&#13;
of funds for imports, efforts to privatize and improve bus manufacturing became more urgent.&#13;
Government plans for the development of a bus and other urban transport vehicle industry&#13;
centered on the allocation of investment for the production of various bus and other components&#13;
among state-owned facilities and then allocation of the vehicles among cities. However, a study&#13;
of how to develop a private sector domestic transit vehicle manufacturing industry is included&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                                         Chapter H&#13;
in the project, plus assistance for the sector to attract foreign investment in the form of joint&#13;
ventures with Russian manufacturers (para 5.20).&#13;
F. URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENvIRoNMENT&#13;
2.18        In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union reported to the World Health Organization that&#13;
motor vehicle fumes (from trucks, buses and automobiles) accounted for 13.1 percent of all toxic&#13;
pollutants produced. Thereafter, the number of vehicles expanded dramatically: from 1970 to&#13;
1988, the trucking industry and use of buses increased by about 225 percent, and the sales of&#13;
automobiles for private use increased sixteen-fold. Nevertheless, during the 1980s there was a&#13;
modest 8 percent decrease in emissions from vehicles but because of the greater decline in the&#13;
volume of pollutants emitted from&#13;
stationary  sources (23 percent),             Table 2.2: ATMOSPHERIC EmiSSIONS, 1980-1990&#13;
the share of air pollution emitted                            (million tons)&#13;

increased to 39 percent in 1990                        Source of Emissions      Percent of Total&#13;

Not only were domestic vehicles&#13;
produced without catalytic converters and basics like electronic ignition and exhaust-gas&#13;
recirculation, but also there was the widespread use of gasoline rather than diesel fueled heavy&#13;
vehicles and buses. More than half of the urban bus fleet is still powered by gasoline rather than&#13;
less polluting and more fuel-efficient diesel-powered engines (Annex 5.16, Table 2). Only 30&#13;
percent of gasoline used in Russia is unleaded, which results in the annual emissions of 5,600&#13;
metric tons of lead (Pb) into the atmospheric air.&#13;

2.201       Reductions in CO, HC and Pb emissions can be made by changing the composition&#13;
of the vehicle fleet. The project will have a limited impact on air quality in the project cities&#13;
because of the replacement of gasoline-powered buses by diesel-powered ones, rehabilitation and&#13;
improved maintenance of the bus fleet (para 5.63).&#13;
G. GOvERNmENT URBAN PASSENGER TRANSPORT STRATEGY&#13;
2.21        Government strategy for the sector is to: (i) devolve responsibility for urban&#13;
transport to the municipal level; (ii) separate the organization of urban transport from that of&#13;
trucking and privatize some activities associated with urban transport such as taxi services; (iii)&#13;
eliminate central Government subsidies for urban transport operating losses to oblasts and cities;&#13;
and (iv) try to restore transport capacity by developing the local bus manufacturing capacity so&#13;
as to make available buses that can be purchased with rubles at prices lower than imports. The&#13;
Government has completed its policy of devolving all responsibility for urban transport to the&#13;
local level and is no longer funding operating subsidies. However, the transition has not been&#13;
smooth and local governments are trying to cope with a situation where funding for urban&#13;
transport companies has not been provided in a timely fashion, with consequent impact on&#13;
vehicle availability and replacement rates (para 2.9). Although it can encourage the separation&#13;
of trucking and taxi services from municipal urban transport companies, the central Government&#13;
has no direct influence over such policies, since all such decisions are now taken at the oblast&#13;
level. The provision of routine and emergency subventions to oblast and regional governments&#13;
that in turn assist municipalities with their deficits instead of direct subsidies for urban transport,&#13;
means that the Government has little control over urban transport policies and practices at the&#13;
local level.&#13;
2.22        The two major underlying problems of urban transport in Russia are that the&#13;
companies' operations are not financially self-sustaining and they lack sufficient overall financing&#13;
to maintain transport capacity. These problems have only just begun to be addressed at any level&#13;
of Government. Clearly, the current level of subsidies (85-95 percent of total operating costs in&#13;
most cities) is not sustainable in a situation of mounting municipal budget deficits and pressures&#13;
to fund more and more activities. Therefore, under the project the participating cities will agree&#13;
to: (a) increase the urban transport companies' cost recovery; and (b) contract with urban&#13;
transport companies on terms that set financial and operating performance improvement targets&#13;
for urban transport services.&#13;

URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
III. URBAN TRANSPORT IN THE PROJECT CITIES&#13;
AND SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE PROJECT&#13;
A. URBAN TRANSPORT IN THE CANDIDATE CmEs&#13;
3.1       Project Cities. At the beginning of the preparation of the project, medium-sized&#13;
cities were invited to apply for assistance with replacement of their urban transport vehicle fleet&#13;
under the Bank loan. Initially, ten cities applied to be included in the project after a series of&#13;
seminars explaining the terms and conditions of the loan were held by MOT with a number of&#13;
potentially interested cities; five additional cities applied at a later date. Consequently, fifteen&#13;
self-selected cities submitted requests to be included in the project. The cities are Cherepovets,&#13;
Kostroma, Kursk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novgorod, Omsk, Pskov, Rostov-on-Don, Samara,&#13;
Saransk, Smolensk, Tver, Velikie Luki, Vologda, and Yekaterinburg. They range in population&#13;
from 116,000 in Velikie Luki to 1,451,000 in Nizhniy Novgorod, and total 9.4 million. All are&#13;
located in the European part of Russia except for Omsk which is in Western Siberia (Map IBRD&#13;
26294). The cities are engaged in diversified economic activities ranging from ferrous metallurgy&#13;
and heavy machine-building (Cherepovets, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Novgorod) to oil refining and&#13;
petrochemical industry (Omsk, Samara) to transportation equipment manufacturing (Nizhniy&#13;
Novgorod - trucks, ships, cars; Samara - aircraft; Rostov-on-Don and Omsk - farm tractors and&#13;
combines; Tver - rail cars) to labor-intensive electronics and textile industries (Novgorod, Pskov,&#13;
Smolensk, Vologda, Velikie Luki). Five of the cities are among the nation's major industrial&#13;
hubs with a population of over one million people each (Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg,&#13;
Samara, Omsk, Rostov-on-Don). Details of each city are given in Table 3. 1 and Annex 3.1.&#13;
3.2       The Bank and the Government agreed upon minimum urban transport reforms as a&#13;
condition for inclusion in the project (para 3.42). At appraisal, only seven cities had achieved&#13;
a cost recovery ratio in excess of 20 percent by the end of the first quarter 1994 but it was&#13;
estimated at that time that about ten cities might reach 25 percent by the end of the second&#13;
quarter and thus be eligible for inclusion in the project. However, the remaining cities (except&#13;
for Kursk, who declined to be in the project) were determined to take actions to improve their&#13;
financial performance to meet the project's eligibility cost recovery target of 25 percent by&#13;
negotiations. Financial data submitted to the Bank in August 1994 for the second quarter 1994&#13;
and, in some cases, also for the month of July, 1994, showed that, with the exception of the&#13;
Omsk tram company, all of the transit companies in fourteen candidate cities met the 25 percent&#13;
cost recovery target. All fourteen also formally agreed, at appraisal, to implement the reform&#13;
program. Thus, fourteen cities qualified for inclusion in the project. Cities were able to make&#13;
these improvements by raising fares in real terms, by reducing exemptions and by increasing&#13;
transit revenues by using subsidies to directly purchase transit passes for exempt passengers.&#13;

3.3        Urban Transport Companies in the Project Cities. Urban transport service in most&#13;
of the project cities is provided by a mix of buses, trams and trolleybuses; altogether, there are&#13;
a total of 37 urban transport companies of which 23 are bus companies, 11 electric transport&#13;
companies and 3 metros (Table 3.1). The metros and several of the companies are outside the&#13;
scope of the project. Most cities have one bus and one electric transport company, but in some&#13;
cases the companies are more like holding companies with the depots acting as fairly&#13;
autonomous entities. Clearly, some of the cities need to consolidate the management of the&#13;
companies and this will be addressed under the project. By 1994, the three smallest cities&#13;
(Velikie Luki, Pskov and Novgorod) were using single-mode transport systems (buses only),&#13;
while the three largest ones (Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Samara) operated buses,&#13;
trolleybuses, trams, and underground metro systems. The metro systems, however, account for&#13;
a relatively small amount of passenger traffic in these cities (6.3 percent, 2.2 percent and 1.5&#13;
percent, respectively). In most cases, these different modes have been organized and operated&#13;
separately with each mode concentrating on a different segment of demand. For the most part,&#13;
trams and trolleybuses serve the most heavily trafficked urban corridors while the buses serve&#13;
a broader area and carry passengers from city centers to suburban neighborhoods and satellite&#13;
areas further out. Most of the project urban transport companies operate only intracity and&#13;
suburban passenger services; intercity services have been spun off into separate companies or&#13;
have remained under the jurisdiction of the oblast. Just over 50 percent of passengers are&#13;
transported by bus, 20 percent by trolleybus, and 30 percent by tram in the 15 candidate cities&#13;
(Annex 3.1). Sixty percent of passenger km are accounted for by bus transport, 15 percent by&#13;
trolleybus, and 25 percent by tram.&#13;
3.4       In a number of cities, the public urban transport companies are supplemented by&#13;
enterprise-owned transport services operated for their own employees: in several industrial cities,&#13;
like Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg, or Omsk, a number of employers own their own bus or&#13;
minivan fleets. In some cities, major employers contract with the cities to provide passes to their&#13;
workers.&#13;
3.5        Urban Transport Institutional Framework in the Project Cities. All urban transport&#13;
operations were formerly the responsibility of the oblast governments, but operations for most&#13;
of these, together with the responsibility for supporting them, have been devolved to the&#13;
municipal level. In several cities, however, operations are still effectively controlled by the&#13;
oblast. Oblast govemments are also still the primary source of subsidies for some of the urban&#13;
transport companies because of the lack of funds at the local level. In most cases, however, the&#13;
right to increase tariffs rests with the municipality. In the absence of elected Dumas at the local&#13;
level, fare increases in many of the cities have been implemented by mayoral decree. Whether&#13;
the informality and responsiveness of this tariff approval process can be sustained once municipal&#13;
Dumas are reinstated is an issue.&#13;
3.6        Where devolvement has occurred, some cities exercise direct control over urban&#13;
transport operations through municipal departments. Others have established the urban transport&#13;
companies as autonomous entities with responsibility for all day-to-day operations, such as&#13;
dispatching, maintenance, accounting, purchasing of spare parts and administration. In these&#13;
cases, the companies themselves maintain their own financial records, calculate the need for fare&#13;
increases and compile cost data necessary to justify proposed tariff increases. Most of the urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                            Chapter Im&#13;
transport companies in the project cities have formed autonomous companies and are operating&#13;
them under detailed performance contracts with the city governments; these contracts specify&#13;
routes to be served, timetables and performance targets to be achieved by the company as well&#13;
as the level of subsidy to be provided by the municipal government. In some cases, however,&#13;
the subsidy agreement is merely to pay whatever operating loss results from the provision of&#13;
specified service.&#13;
3.7        One of the major obstacles to the establishment of performance contracts between&#13;
urban transport companies and municipal governments and privatization of urban transport&#13;
companies is the uncertain financial situation of the municipalities. Given the deteriorating&#13;
budget situation for most municipalities, the local governments have not been able to provide&#13;
subsidies in a timely fashion, thereby making it impossible for urban transport companies to&#13;
adhere to agreed service standards. Therefore, in reality the existence of performance contracts&#13;
or privatized operations makes little difference to the efficiency of operations or service levels.&#13;
Given urban transport companies' low cost recovery, municipal governments still have&#13;
considerable influence over the companies because of their control over fare levels and allocation&#13;
of subsidies. In practice, the transport department within the municipal government works&#13;
closely with the transport operator to provide political assistance in achieving tariff increases,&#13;
to identify land parcels suitable for garages and depots and to assist in the provision of&#13;
replacement vehicles to the extent possible, including searching for second-hand buses.&#13;
3.8        Some cities have gone farther than others in separating the municipal government&#13;
from urban transport operations. One of the project cities, Vologda, is even considering&#13;
privatizing the electric transport company and forming an employee-owned company. Other&#13;
activities of the oblast level transport association to which the project urban transport companies&#13;
formerly belonged, such as trucking, intercity bus and taxi services, have been split up and&#13;
divested. In most cases, the trucking services have been privatized, intercity bus services have&#13;
been separated from city and suburban services, and taxis have been privatized.&#13;
3.9        Operational Performance oj Urban Trawsport Cornpanies in the Project Cities.&#13;
Operational performance varies somewhat according to the type of vehicle operated, the route&#13;
structure served, and the degree of autonomy and organizational circumstances of each urban&#13;
transport company. Nonetheless, there are far more similarities than differences. For the most&#13;
part, transport operations per se are well-run and maintenance well-organized and executed. The&#13;
major problems with performance relate to the deteriorating condition of the fleet.&#13;
3.10       Vehicle breakdowns have increased, and the availability of vehicles decreased, as&#13;
a consequence of a number of factors: a lack of funds for replacement vehicles, and, in&#13;
particular, a lack of foreign ex-haoge to spare jparts ar,d non-Russian made buses; a lack of&#13;
supply of spare parts for Russian imade buses; and increasing fuel costs. The fleet is old and&#13;
deteriorating, utilization rates are declining and transport capacity has been reduced substantially&#13;
over the last three or four years. At the same time, buses are filled with passengers and the ratio&#13;
of empty vehicle-kilometers to total operational vehicle-kilometers per year is quite low, varying&#13;
from one percent in Omsk and Smolensk to 11 percent in Cherepovets.&#13;

3.11           Tables 3.2  and  3.3  contain  highlights of individual urban  transport companies'&#13;
vehicle fleet operating performance in each of the project cities. Further details are given in&#13;
Annexes 3.1 and 3.2. As shown therein, the percent of fleet that is operational varies from 62&#13;
percent to 87 percent for bus companies, 67 percent to 100 percent for trolleybuses, and 48&#13;
percent to 94 percent for trams; the breakdown rate varies from one percent to 29 percent for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                          Chapter I&#13;
buses, one percent to 23 percent for trolleybuses, and 5 percent to 30 percent for trams. Even&#13;
if vehicles are repaired and rehabilitated, the existing fleet in most cities is not sufficient to meet&#13;
minimum service levels during peak hours of travel and the situation is rapidly deteriorating.&#13;
The next three to four years will be critical since over 50 percent of the fleets in nine of the&#13;
cities will reach the end of their economic life (Table 3.2). Average age of the bus fleets&#13;
(Annex 3.2) varies from 7.6 years in Velikie Luki to 4.8 years in Nizhniy Novgorod (most buses&#13;
have an economic life of 8-10 years), while average age of electric transport fleet varies from&#13;
10.7 years for trams in Samara to 2.9 years for trolleybuses in Smolensk.&#13;
3.12      The effect of the deteriorating fleet on passengers is a significant decrease in the&#13;
quality of service. Waiting times have increased and vehicles are extremely overcrowded,&#13;
particularly at peak periods. Overcrowding is evident from the high levels of average passengers&#13;
per square meter of transport capacity recorded. Ten out of the fifteen candidate cities have more&#13;
than eight passengers per bus square meter during peak periods; six cities have more than ten&#13;
passengers per bus square meter (Table 3.2). A similar situation exists for trolleybuses and&#13;
trams.&#13;
3.13      Despite these poor conditions, the transport planning and operational capability of&#13;
the project companies is satisfactory. The route networks are generally well-designed and, for&#13;
the most part, the different modes complement rather than compete with each other where&#13;
several urban transport companies operate in the same city. All parts of the towns are well-&#13;
served, and, with the high level of ridership, it has been possible to minimize the number of&#13;
connections per passenger. Passenger trip distances tend to be short, averaging 3.1 km and 3.8&#13;
km for trolleybuses and trams, and 4.7 km for buses (Annex 3.1). The project companies&#13;
continually monitor demand and make adjustments to route schedules and service points as&#13;
appropriate. Staff are competent and professional (indeed many of the mechanical staff are&#13;
extraordinarily inventive in their efforts to keep badly deteriorating vehicles in service) and work&#13;
methods are good. Incentive systems in a number of the cities have been revised to maximize&#13;
driver and vehicle utilization, although in several of the project cities (e.g., Yekaterinburg,&#13;
Samara, and Nizhniy Novgorod) problems exist. Overall staffing levels are in line with&#13;
international practice varying for most project companies from three to six staff per vehicle&#13;
(although a few electric transport companies need to reduce staffing levels, particularly in Tver,&#13;
Kursk, Samara and Smolensk). A particular problem is the somewhat higher than international&#13;
practice in administrative staff per vehicle, with more than two staff per operating vehicle for&#13;
the bus company in Cherepovets and electric transport companies in Kursk, Omsk, Rostov-on-&#13;
Don, Saransk, Smolensk and Tver.&#13;
3.14      Maintenance. Most of the project urban transport companies do an admirable job&#13;
of maintaining their vehicles with the resources at hand. A high percentage of recommended&#13;
maintenance schedules are completed, with trolleybus and tram companies more successful at&#13;
this than the bus companies due to the higher availability of spare parts and, according to the&#13;
bus directors, to the better maintenance facilities of the tram and trolleybus companies.&#13;
Nonetheless, some garages are in need of workshop equipment and some companies could use&#13;
assistance in ensuring that maintenance of vehicles does not unduly reduce vehicle utilization.&#13;
The project will provide financing for the provision of a limited amount of workshop equipment.&#13;
The project will also provide technical assistance for maintenance planning and vehicle&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter m                                                                             17&#13;
replacement and in making investment decisions as strategic tradeoffs between rehabilitation,&#13;
write-offs and new investments. To this end, the assistance will help put in place a cost&#13;
accounting system for tracking maintenance and operations by vehicle type.&#13;
3.15       Purchasing and Inventory. Efficiency of the companies in the areas of purchasing&#13;
and inventory control of spare parts is particularly constrained by a shortage of suppliers, as well&#13;
as a shortage of funds. In many cases, there is only a single supplier of parts, the manufacturer,&#13;
and the companies cannot put their requirements out for bid. In addition, the order quantity is&#13;
dependent upon the availability of funds, and even when funds are available, payments through&#13;
the Russian banking system are often so delayed that the supplier cancels the order. Inventory&#13;
control is carried out manually, using stock cards and a second set of accounting records. The&#13;
authorization required to draw parts is dependent upon the part, with the more expensive parts&#13;
requiring a higher level of authorization. Stock wastage, due to damage or theft, is relatively&#13;
low, though there have been problems of theft of parked vehicles in some cities. The project will&#13;
provide assistance in competitive procurement of spares parts and in adopting more modem&#13;
inventory controls and stock usage.&#13;
3.16       Urban Transport Supply in the Project Cities. Data on the transport supply available&#13;
in the project cities in summarized in Annex 3.1. The total length of network in each city (for&#13;
all modes) varies from 151 km in Cherepovets to 2,070 km in Nizhniy Novgorod. Overall the&#13;
number of vehicles offering service varies from 1,967 in Omsk to 69 in Velikie Luki. The total&#13;
number of buses operated in all fifteen candidate cities is 6,525, the number of trolleybuses&#13;
1,916 and the number of trams 2,159 (Table 3.3). The number of these vehicles that are&#13;
operational totals 4,868 buses, 1,490 trolleybuses, and 1,525 trams, which represents an average&#13;
of 75 percent for the bus fleet, 80 percent for the trolleybus fleet and 71 percent for the tram&#13;
fleet. The number of operational vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants varies from 0.48 in Velikie Luki&#13;
to 1.36 in Omsk. This compares to the Russian standard of 1.0 per 1,000 population and 0.5 in&#13;
the USA where relatively few travel by urban transport. In terms of transport capacity, however,&#13;
the carrying capacity of the fleet in terms of passenger-kilometers is more relevant to assess&#13;
adequacy of capacity than the number of vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants.&#13;

3.17      Demand for Urban Transport in the Project Cities. The number of passengers&#13;
carried per year by each of the urban transport companies in the project cities is summarized in&#13;
Annex 3.1. Taking the project cities together, on average, inhabitants make 690 trips per year&#13;
(or 1.9 trips per day) per capita with individual cities averaging from 323 trips per year per&#13;
capita in Velikie Luki to 797 trips per year per capita in Tver, or in terms of trips per day from&#13;
0.9 to 2.2. Given that the number of workers in each city averages about 50 percent of the&#13;
population, much of the ridership is associated with taking people to and from work.&#13;
3.18       Gap Between Supply and Demand in the Project Cities. Capacity measurement varies&#13;
depending upon assumptions about service quality in terms of the average numbers of passengers&#13;
per square meter. Some of the buses in the project cities are so overcrowded that they are being&#13;
operated at an average of 11-14 passengers per square meter at peak hours (Table 3.2). The&#13;
project would provide financing for new vehicles so that service levels could be improved to a&#13;
minimal level of 8 passengers per square meter at peak hours. To attain an even more&#13;
comfortable level of service of, say, 6-7 passenger per sq.m. several of the cities intend to&#13;
purchase additional vehicles, many of them used, within the scope of the project. The acquisition&#13;
of these additional vehicles will slightly lower the economic rate of return on the project and&#13;
increase the burden of capital related transport subsidies to be absorbed by city budgets.&#13;
3.19       Future Demand for Urban Transport in the Project Cities. For the most part, the&#13;
demand for urban transport is expected to continue at current levels. In some cities, where&#13;
restructuring of enterprises is expected to bring about significant increases in unemployment, it&#13;
is likely that there may be a decrease in peak travel but overall traffic levels are expected to&#13;
remain the same as unemployed workers are still expected to average one trip per day, for job&#13;
seeking, running errands, or visiting garden plots. In most of the cities, the rate of increase in&#13;
automobile ownership is low and there is not expected to be much diversion of ridership from&#13;
urban transport companies to private car.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL SrrUATION IN THE PROJECT CrrmEs&#13;
3.20      Financial Situation of Urban Transport Companies in the Project Cities. The&#13;
financial situation of the project urban transport companies is extremely poor and essentially&#13;
unsustainable without subsidies. Since revenues fall far short of operating expenses and&#13;
companies are no longer cross-subsidized from more profitable trucking operations, the&#13;
companies have no means of generating funds for investment. In every one of the cities (indeed,&#13;
probably in every city in Russia), there is, therefore, a need for subsidies to cover operating&#13;
losses and to provide capital investment for replacement and rehabilitation of vehicles.&#13;
3.21       Income statements for 1992, estimated results for 1993, forecasts for 1994-1997&#13;
period and selected ratios for each urban transport company in the project cities are contained&#13;
in the Project File. During appraisal, actual results for 1993 and first quarter 1994 were&#13;
collected and reviewed. Subsequently, financial data for the second quarter, and for the month&#13;
of July 1994, were submitted to the Bank so that the cities' ability to meet the project&#13;
eligibility's cost recovery target of 25 percent by negotiations could be determined. A summary&#13;
of highlights from these data, which are in the Project File, is contained in Table 3.4.&#13;

3.22       Operating Losses and Cost Recovery Ratios. As shown therein, operating costs&#13;
(excluding depreciation and interest charges on debt of which there is little since capital costs&#13;
are provided by Government) exceeded revenues by a substantial margin in every city; total&#13;
revenues for fourteen cities in 1992 were Rbl.3 billion and total costs Rb6.5 billion for a net&#13;
operating loss of Rb5.2 billion and a cost recovery ratio of 20 percent. In 1993 total revenues&#13;
of all modes for all fifteen cities were Rb12.4 billion and costs were RblO4.2 billion, for a net&#13;
operating loss of Rb9l.8 billion and a cost recovery ratio of 12 percent. Cost recovery was 14&#13;
percent for buses only in 1993, and for electric transit companies was 9 percent.&#13;
3.23       The situation worsened as costs increased faster than fares could be increased. In&#13;
1993, the level of cost recovery in the project cities ranged from a low of 5.9 percent for buses&#13;
in Rostov to a high of 33.4 percent in Cherepovets; for electric transit companies the lowest was&#13;
5.3 percent in Nizhniy Novgorod to a high of 20.2 percent in Vologda. Only the city of&#13;
Kostroma showed improvement for buses, while cost recovery in nearly all the other cities&#13;
decreased. A number of cities have been pressured to improve these results in order to qualify&#13;
for the project and cost recovery ratios have begun to improve. In the first quarter of 1994 cost&#13;
recovery in the project cities ranged from a high of 52 percent Cherepovets to a low of 13&#13;
percent in Nizhniy Novgorod for buses; for electric transit a high of 45 percent in Samara for&#13;
trolleybuses (including revenues from exempt tickets financed by the city) to a low of 3 percent&#13;
for Nizhniy Novgorod trams. By the second quarter of 1994, cost recovery ranged from a high&#13;
of 65 percent in Cherepovets to a low of 25 percent in Nizhniy Novgorod for buses; for electric&#13;
transit a high of 60 percent in Samara for trolleybuses (again including revenues from exempt&#13;
tickets financed by the city) to a low of 8 percent for Nizhniy Novgorod trams. Nizhniy&#13;
Novgorod subsequently raised fares to Rb200 for a single trip, highest of all the cities, and lifted&#13;
the cost recovery ratio of its trolleybus and tram company to 25 percent for the month of July,&#13;
1994. The dynamics of cost recovery for each city can be seen in Table 6.1. Overall, a total of&#13;
eight cities improved cost recovery for bus companies and seven cities for electric transport in&#13;
the first quarter of 1994 compared to 1993; and, all fourteen cities improved cost recovery in&#13;
all transit companies, except Omsk tram, in the second quarter 1994 compared to the first&#13;
quarter.&#13;
3.24       Cost Components. The mix of expense components also shifted somewhat between&#13;
1992 and 1993, reflecting the different rates of inflation for wages, and of inflation and&#13;
availability of fuel and spare parts. Average fuel costs in 1993 were 30-35 percent of world price&#13;
levels. As fuel prices move toward world levels, therefore, the percentage of operating expenses&#13;
spent on fuel will increase and cost recovery will be further reduced unless tariffs are increased&#13;
to compensate.&#13;
3.25      Spare Part Expenditures. The results would also be worse if the companies had been&#13;
able to locate and purchase spare parts at a level sufficient to keep the fleet operational.&#13;
According to Bank studies, on average, spare part expenditure equals about 9 percent of capital&#13;
costs for a bus of medium age and about 11 percent for a very old bus. In the project cities,&#13;
spare part expenditures are averaging about 2 percent of the capital cost of buses (based on the&#13;
end 1993 price of LiAZ buses and comparing this to fourth quarter expenditures for 1993 in&#13;
several cities). If more funds were available, and if there were no problem with the supply of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter Im                                                                         23&#13;
spare parts, clearly operating expenses for spare parts should increase by about five times to&#13;
ensure more normal maintenance of bus fleets in Russia.&#13;
3.26       Spare parts necessary to catch up with maintenance and rehabilitate vehicles out-of-&#13;
service will be made available under the project. The additional expenditure for spare parts will&#13;
again lower cost recovery levels unless tariffs are raised to cover the additional costs. Given the&#13;
low level of spare part availability in the last several years, however, it is likely that the sudden&#13;
availability of spare parts under the project will result in an abnormally high percentage of&#13;
expenditures on spare parts and cost recovery will be reduced further unless tariffs are raised&#13;
to compensate. In assessing the adequacy of cost recovery rates in any given year, however, it&#13;
would be prudent to make adjustments for the potential distortion that might be caused from the&#13;
expensing in one year of spare part usage that, in fact, represents a "catching up of&#13;
maintenance", which might be better handled as a capital expense equivalent to rehabilitation.&#13;
The degree to which assessment of the urban transport companies' performance against target&#13;
cost recovery rates needs modification to take account of this distortion will be determined on&#13;
a case-by-case basis by comparing spare part expenses with the capital costs of city fleets.&#13;
Distortions might also result from efforts to postpone payment of expenses from one time period&#13;
to another to meet cost recovery targets for a given time period. For this reason, the loan&#13;
agreement will aim to encourage cities to sustain cost recovery targets once reached. This will&#13;
be done through a combination of increasing the cost recovery targets over the course of the&#13;
project and by stipulating, in the Loan Agreement's definition of a cost recovery ratio, that it&#13;
should be calculated over six month periods. For a city to meet the target of 35 percent by&#13;
December 1, 1995, for example, cost recovery must be 35 percent for the preceding six month&#13;
period from June through December 1, 1995. As of the beginning of 1995, most of the cities&#13;
look as if they will achieve this target and many will even surpass it (para 6.6).&#13;
3.27!      Given the shortage of working capital and borrowing constraints, the project&#13;
companies adjusted as they could to cash shortages. They limited salary increases, reduced&#13;
maintenance and curtailed some services. They also increased their arrears in accounts payable&#13;
for fuel. These measures are only of short term help, however; as time passes, more and more&#13;
cities subsequently have raised wages and faced real increases in fuel costs. Most have since&#13;
realized that the scope for cost cutting is limited and that increasing revenues is a more&#13;
promising means of improving cash flow.&#13;
3.28      Average Yields and Tariffs. The average yield per passenger in these cities as of the&#13;
first quarter 1994 ranged from a low of Rbl.O per passenger trip to a high of Rb6.5 for buses&#13;
and a low of RbO.9 to a high of Rb3.5 for electric transport respectively. By comparison, the&#13;
actual fares by June 1994 ranged from Rb5O per trip (four cities), to Rb6O per trip (two cities)&#13;
to Rb O00 per trip (five cities), Rb 150 per trip (one city), to a high of Rb200 per trip (one city).&#13;
Except for Cherepovets, which had a fare of Rb4O per trip in December 1993, fares in the other&#13;
cities were either RblO or Rb2O per trip in December 1993. Thus, in most cities, fares have&#13;
gone up at least five times since December 1993. By early 1995, fares were in the Rb300 to&#13;
Rb400 per trip average. Still, there is a great difference between average yield and average&#13;
fares. The difference reflects the extraordinary numbers of exempt passengers and the fact that&#13;
many passengers buy monthly passes which offer a substantial discount from the single fare&#13;
tariff.&#13;

December 1, 1995 and 40 percent for the six months ending March 31, 1996 (para 8.3). The&#13;
project cities have also agreed to a target of 50 percent cost recovery by the end of 1997 (para&#13;
3.42).&#13;
3.30      Exemptions. The cost recovery situation is exacerbated by the fact that central and&#13;
local governments have instituted many categories of exemptions for particular groups of urban&#13;
transport users in Russia. For example, all military and many governmental personnel are&#13;
exempt from paying fares as a directive of the central government, while at the local level&#13;
exemptions have been given to school children, widows, and pensioners (Box 3.1). The percent&#13;
of passengers that do pay ranges from 24 percent in Rostov to 73 percent in Velikie Luki.&#13;
Another problem is that the buses are so crowded and the number of exempt passengers so great,&#13;
that many other passengers - so called "rabbits" - simply board and ride vehicles without&#13;
paying.&#13;
3.31      Measures to Reduce Fare Evasion. Some of the cities are taking steps to cut back&#13;
on the number of "rabbits" as one means of improving cost recovery. Some have hired&#13;
unemployed housewives to serve as "checkers" of tickets and to impose fines upon riders found&#13;
without legitimate tickets. The fine is relatively stiff for a rider (about Rbl,500, or 10 percent&#13;
of an average worker's salary). In some cases, the unemployed checkers are permitted to keep&#13;
the fines as salary. Other cities have hired transport police to cut back on rabbits. As part of the&#13;
reform program, the project cities will undertake to reduce fare evasion to 10 percent of daily&#13;
passenger trips by June 30, 1996 (para 3.42).&#13;
3.32      Efforts to Reduce Exemptions. The practice of extending exemptions to segments of&#13;
the population for social reasons is unfortunately so pervasive that no effort to improve cost&#13;
recovery will be successful unless it is combined with a commitment to reduce exemptions. In&#13;
several cities this effort is already underway. In two of the project cities, exemptions to&#13;
pensioners have been withdrawn; instead, deserving pensioners pay one-fifth of the price of a&#13;
monthly fare pass and the city pays the urban transport company the other four-fifths on behalf&#13;
of the pensioner. The entire issue of exemptions is complicated by the fact that a number of&#13;
them have been instituted at the Federal level, some at the oblast level and many others at the&#13;
local level. A concerted effort is needed to end this practice and, where social needs justify&#13;
subsidizing riders, to subsidize the rider directly. MOF has indicated that the Federal&#13;
Government has absolved itself of any responsibility for exemptions, with the implication that&#13;
local governments can make their own decisions as to whether or not to continue them.&#13;
Unfortunately, local governments do not have the confidence to reverse Federal policy without&#13;
an official decree authorizing them to do so. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect local&#13;
governments to order military personnel to pay for urban transport. The Government has&#13;
undertaken to determine the effect of fare exemptions on the financial viability of urban&#13;
transport companies and, based on the results of such assessment, undertake measures,&#13;
including those at the federal level, aimed at reducing exemptions and increasing the cost&#13;
recovery ratio of the companies (para 8.1).&#13;
3.33      Such a measure would considerably enhance cost recovery ratios. According to&#13;
analysis of the candidate companies, if exemptions had been eliminated or if subsidies had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                         Chapter m&#13;
directly tied to exemptions and considered as revenue, average cost recovery of the project cities&#13;
would have improved from 12 percent to 25 percent in 1993.&#13;
3.34      Economic Affordability of Urban Transport. A principal aim of the reforms required&#13;
for participation in the project is to improve cost recovery and thereby reduce the fiscal burden&#13;
of urban transport on municipalities. Urban public transport in Russia, however, is the principal&#13;
means of daily urban mobility for a very large proportion of the Russian population. Thus,&#13;
measures taken to improve cost recovery should not raise fares to levels that the average Russian&#13;
citizen cannot afford. To ensure that fare increases instituted to reach the project's targeted&#13;
levels of cost recovery are affordable, monthly incomes of wage earners and of households were&#13;
analyzed to determine the percentage spent on urban transport at current fare levels, and the&#13;
impact of increases in fares to levels that would achieve full cost recovery on the proportion of&#13;
income spent on urban transport.&#13;
3.35      According to Table 3.5, urban transport expenditures in the project cities ranged&#13;
from about 0.9 percent to 3.1 percent of average household income in March 1994. If cities&#13;
were to achieve a 100 percent cost recovery level, fares would have had to be increased about&#13;
100 percent in Cherepovets; 200 percent in Vologda; 300 percent in Velikie Luki, Smolensk,&#13;
Saransk, Samara, Omsk, and Novgorod; 400 percent in Kostroma; 600-700 percent in Pskov,&#13;
Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg, and Tver; and 900 percent in Rostov. These higher fares,&#13;
in turn, would increase the percent of average household income spent on transport to a range&#13;
of between 2.2 percent and 7.6 percent. Since the maximum cost recovery goal under the project&#13;
is not 100 percent, but 50 percent, the increase in the percentage of average monthly household&#13;
expenditure accounted for by urban transport would range from about one percent to five&#13;
percent. Since this analysis was done on the basis of the number of current paying passengers,&#13;
it does not reflect the fact that fares could be half as high if revenues for all passengers were&#13;
collected.&#13;
3.36      This percentage is not unreasonably high by world standards, according to&#13;
information presented in Bus Services: Reducing Costs, Raising Standards, by Armstrong-Wright&#13;
and Thierez. Their research indicates that in developing countries, 10 percent is about the&#13;
maximum level of household income that should be spent on urban transport usage. This&#13;
percentage could be higher in Russia, where expenditures for such other categories as housing,&#13;
utilities, and clothing are highly subsidized, and therefore, a much lower proportion of income.&#13;
Consequently, after adjusting for non-cash benefits, the maximum level of household income that&#13;
could be spent on urban transport in Russia is 12 percent. However, it is highly likely that&#13;
households will have to bear a greater share of such expenditures in the future so that the 10&#13;
percent maximum may be the more appropriate measure. Irrespective of whether the maximum&#13;
is 10 percent or 12 percent of household income, the impact of full cost recovery on average&#13;
monthly household expenditures would not be unreasonable, as long as incomes continue to be&#13;
adjusted for inflation on a relatively frequent basis. With respect to the ability of the poorest&#13;
groups in society, it should be noted that a system is currently in place to exempt these&#13;
individuals from paying for transport. In some cities, subsidies for this purpose are provided&#13;
through the purchase of monthly passes; in others, this cost is incorporated as a general subsidy&#13;
to cover transit company losses.&#13;

3.37             A related issue is whether monthly incomes in the project cities have kept pace with&#13;
inflation as it is possible that even if the fares appear affordable at current levels, they may not&#13;
remain so in a high inflationary environment. Of the six project cities reporting wage figures for&#13;
both 1992 and 1993, four reflect an increase of 12-14 times, the fifth went up by 2.5 times, and&#13;
the last went up a reported 36 times. If the high and the low figures are discounted, and we use&#13;
a 12-14 times measure to gauge against inflation, it appears - based on preliminary analysis -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                           Chapter m&#13;
that monthly incomes during the period examined (average 1992 through late 1993) for the most&#13;
part have not been adjusted to absorb the impact of inflation. (The price index rose from 20.6&#13;
in June 1992 to 541.4 in December 1993, an increase of more than 26 times. It is important to&#13;
note, however, that prices have been rising in larger metropolitan areas somewhat more rapidly&#13;
than in medium-sized and smaller cities.) Nevertheless, expenditures on urban transport still&#13;
seem to form a very small part of total household expenditures.&#13;
C. LEVEL OF SUBSIDIES&#13;
3.38      Methods of Subsidy Allocation. Each city and oblast is free to determine its methods&#13;
of subsidy allocations. Transport has not been an item in city budgets until recently so methods&#13;
of allocation are still under development. Most of the local governments express a desire to base&#13;
the subsidies on some form of service delivery but the current chaotic financial situation makes&#13;
it difficult to implement such a policy. In fact, the allocations appear to be based more on&#13;
standard budgetary reviews where the government tries to balance the needs for transport&#13;
subsidies against other demands in a situation of very inadequate resources. Usually they do&#13;
include a review of the performance indicators and targets. Subsidies are generally inadequate&#13;
to provide desired, or even former, levels of service.&#13;
3.39       Since the local and central governments are committed to the provision of funds&#13;
sufficient to enable the companies to operate under reasonable technical standards and minimum&#13;
acceptable levels of quality of service, the level of subsidies should be established on a&#13;
sustainable basis and used to stimulate improvements in efficiency. This will first require&#13;
substantial improvements in the companies' recurrent and capital budgeting procedures, so that&#13;
their financial needs, as well as the financial impact of various measure to improve efficiency,&#13;
can be clearly established. Second, the operating budgets should be prepared and approved each&#13;
year taking into account agreed improvements in efficiency and in the context of performance&#13;
contracts that specify performance targets in terms of vehicle and driver utilization, yield factors,&#13;
efficiency of vehicle maintenance and availability of parts for repair and sustainability of the&#13;
service. The local and central governments also need to have a clearer idea of the least cost&#13;
means of meeting their urban transport needs. Currently many of the cities have several modes&#13;
of urban transport and a number of them are contemplating expansion or even introduction of&#13;
trolleybus or tram services in order to avoid having to pay for expensive foreign buses. Most&#13;
of the plans currently under discussion have never been evaluated. There is a need, therefore,&#13;
to undertake a least cost analysis of the transport systems in the project cities and to develop&#13;
better investment analyses of proposed investments before city or oblast governments agree to&#13;
finance them. The project includes assistance to carry out such analyses and to assist in&#13;
developing means to reduce subsidies, increase fare recovery and exemptions and reduce&#13;
operating costs to the extent possible.&#13;
3.40       Citywide Transport Plans for New  Investment. The difficulty of obtaining&#13;
replacement vehicles for their urban transport companies, particularly Ikarus-made buses, in&#13;
conjunction with fuel shortages, has led a number of municipal governments and transport&#13;
experts to formulate plans to create new trolleybus or tram companies (and, in one case, a&#13;
metro) to expand transport capacity. In some cities, poles and wires for the trolleybuses have&#13;
already been installed, although it may be some time before any trolleybuses are purchased. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IH                                                                      29&#13;
the city governments, trolleybuses may seem to be a good alternate to buying foreign buses&#13;
because they are made in Russia and the price is so low as to obviously not reflect economic&#13;
costs. In Western countries, trolleybuses are far costlier than diesel-powered buses (at&#13;
US$300,000 to US$500,000 each, at least twice as expensive as buses) but in Russia they are&#13;
cheaper. The disadvantages of trolleybuses are that they are less flexible and require electricity&#13;
which is currently priced far below economic costs and whose subsidy is already a costly burden&#13;
on Russia's economy. New tram systems are also costly, disruptive to road networks and even&#13;
less flexible than trolleybuses. On the other hand, trolleybuses and trams are considered to have&#13;
greater environmental benefits, although the option of natural gas fueled buses has also to be&#13;
taken into account. The analysis, therefore, of new trolleybus or tram systems is quite complex&#13;
and would have to take account of all the economic costs and benefits and various options. Some&#13;
of the other project cities which already have three modes of urban transport are planning&#13;
expansion of lines and even construction of a metro in one case. Given the financial problems&#13;
of the cities and the need to rehabilitate vehicles and systems already in place, it is important&#13;
that no new investments be initiated unless analysis demonstrates they are economicallyjustified.&#13;
To this end, the project cities have agreed that they will inform the Bank about any&#13;
investment project for its transport system which significantly affects the financial situation&#13;
of the project city, and shall inform the Bank of the results of relevant feasibility studies&#13;
in order to enable the Bank to provide its opinion regarding the project (para 8.3). Further,&#13;
all project cities will be required to carry out a financial and economic review of its&#13;
transport system to determine the least cost mode and the type of vehicles within each mode&#13;
by June 30, 1997 (para 8.3). Technical assistance will be provided under the project to assist&#13;
with this effort.&#13;
D. REFORM PROGRAM FOR THE PROJECT CrrIES&#13;
3.41      The cities applied for assistance under the loan on the understanding that they would&#13;
carry out minimum reforms as a condition for inclusion in the project. These reforms should&#13;
assure that those cities selected will use the project investments in an efficient and sustainable&#13;
manner, and demonstrate the effectiveness of such reforms for the rest of the nation. Included&#13;
in the reforms are up-front measures that have to be taken by the cities regarding cost recovery,&#13;
establishment of autonomous urban transport companies and municipal regulatory authority, and&#13;
divestiture of inter-city bus operations.&#13;
3.42      Details of the reform program agreed with the cities included in the project are given&#13;
below.&#13;

trips and seven percent by June 30, 1998.&#13;
Governance of Transport Entities and Corporate Autonomy&#13;
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, transferral of urban transport entities from&#13;
oblast to city level of subordination.&#13;
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, establishment of enterprises participating&#13;
under the project as legally autonomous and corporatized entities (i.e., not part of&#13;
the city government even if partially or fully owned by the city), with significant&#13;
operational independence.&#13;
-    As a condition of inclusion in the project, establishment of a transport department&#13;
(or similar body) with qualified full time staff for the purposes of planning the&#13;
development, and regulation, of the city's urban public transport system.&#13;

systems to determine the least cost mode of urban transport and the least cost type&#13;
of vehicle within each mode.&#13;
Competition and Private Provision of Public Transport Services&#13;
*    Take all necessary measures to support provision of transport services by private&#13;
individuals or companies to encourage wider provision of urban transport services.&#13;
*    By September 1, 1996, preparation of plans for contracts with entities other than the&#13;
project companies to provide urban transport services or auxiliary services.&#13;

3.44            The dialogue between the World Bank and the project cities has resulted in a&#13;
substantial number of reforms being adopted by the municipal governments and urban transport&#13;
companies during project preparation. In particular, significant progress has been achieved on&#13;
devolving responsibility for urban transport to the cities, establishment of autonomous urban&#13;
transport agencies, and divestment of non-transport services.&#13;
3.45            Cost Recovery. As described in para 3.23, financial data submitted to the Bank in&#13;
August 1994 showed that, except for the Omsk tram company, fourteen candidate cities met the&#13;
25 percent cost recovery target. Nizhniy Novgorod's five bus companies met the cost recovery&#13;
target, but still belong to the oblast government, so only its tram and trolleybus companies are&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
3.46            Ten  cities indicated  that they already  have plans to reduce the impact of exempt&#13;
riders on revenues. In addition to reducing the number of fare-exempt riders, urban transport&#13;
companies can improve cost recovery by increasing fares, receiving compensation for&#13;
exemptions from different levels of government, reducing fare evasion, reducing operating costs,&#13;
improving efficiency, and expanding commercial or premium services (although this would be&#13;
better provided by private operators).&#13;

1. Tbe Tram and Trolley Bus Company has completed the reform conditions related to municipal ownership and autonomy of enterpries. The&#13;
bus companies that provide urban transport services in the city are still federally owned and are controlled by Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. The&#13;
municipal government is unwilling, to assume the financial burden of transferring control of the buses from the oblast to the municipality.&#13;
Therefore, the bus companies in Nizhniy Novgorod have been excluded from the project.&#13;
2. In Pskov and Velikie Luki, the oblast still controls some aspects of the bus company, but a decree has been passed and draft charters for the&#13;
bus companies have been drawn up to make them autonomous municipally owned entities. The final steps to establish the autonomous bus&#13;
companies should take place by June 1995.&#13;

3.47        Fare evasion is a major cause of poor cost recovery among transit enterprises. At&#13;
appraisal four cities (Cherepovets, Kostroma, Novgorod, and Smolensk) reported that they have&#13;
already achieved the goal of reducing fare evasion to less than 10 percent of passenger trips&#13;
(although evasion could be higher for the last two cities). All the other cities indicated that they&#13;
intend to try to achieve this target by June 30, 1996. The most common measure taken to reduce&#13;
fare evasion is to place on the buses inspectors authorized to impose on the spot fines on&#13;
offending riders. In some cases, these inspectors are unemployed persons who are entitled to&#13;
keep the fines collected as an incentive to detect fare evaders.&#13;
3.48        Governance and Autonomy. Eleven project cities have assumed control of urban&#13;
transport companies from the oblasts and two others have passed the necessary decrees and plan&#13;
to complete the transfer by June 1995 (Table 3.7). Nizhniy Novgorod has not yet transferred bus&#13;
companies from the oblast to municipal level of government and has decided, therefore, to not&#13;
include buses in the project. Although all cities have established transport departments to conduct&#13;
regulatory activities and planning for transport operations, many cities have tended to maintain&#13;
significant elements of the old system's oblast level control mechanisms to keep track of the&#13;
operations of their transit enterprises. Many continue to perform functions such as operations&#13;
planning, ticket sales, and revenue collection that should be the responsibility of their transit&#13;
enterprises. Thus, substantial work remains to be done during project implementation to ensure&#13;
that such departments: (i) truly allow the transit enterprises to operate autonomously, and (ii)&#13;
restrict their roles (and perform those roles effectively) to planning and regulation.&#13;
3.49        Operating Efficiency and Investment Planning. As one of the elements of the loan&#13;
covenants, each participating city has to agree to develop and implement a program to improve&#13;
the operating efficiency of their urban transport enterprises during the life of the project (Table&#13;
3.8). All cities have indicated their willingness to do so. The extent to which operating costs can&#13;
be reduced will also be emphasized. Operational performance targets have been included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                                                                    Chapter Im&#13;
set of project performance indicators, and will be included in the onlending agreement. Technical&#13;
assistance provided under the project will be available to assist cities in the development and&#13;
implementation of these plans.&#13;
3.50            To  date, little analysis has been  carried  out before investments are undertaken  in&#13;
urban transport. Of particular concern are planned investments in new, and extensions of,&#13;
trolleybus and tram lines (para 3.40). The cities have therefore undertaken to carry out economic&#13;
analysis of new investments with the help of consultants to be financed under the project.&#13;
3.51             Competition and Privatization. Plans to contract out urban transport services should&#13;
specifically include provisions for divesting certain services currently provided by the existing&#13;
transport enterprises to the private sector. Examples include contracting out services such as&#13;
vehicle maintenance and vehicle rehabilitation, contracting for bus services with non-urban&#13;
transport companies (such as those that operate own-account buses), privatization of taxis,&#13;

1. Bus company number 6, which operates some limited urban services, is primarily an intercity company. As long as its services to the city&#13;
are provided under a transparent contract, this will not serve as a bar to Nizhniy Novgorod's participation in the project.&#13;
2. The taxi company was owned by the oblast, not the city. Under a court decision, it is scheduled for privatization by August 1995.&#13;
3. The city has agreed to divest all buses engaged in intercity bus service from the bus enterprises owned and operated by the city to a separate&#13;
enterprise or enterprises not owned by the city, by December31, 1995.&#13;

intercity buses and establishment of private minivans that operate as route taxis. In addition,&#13;
candidate cities should develop plans to divest non-transport activities and facilities such as&#13;
schools, farms, and dwelling units. All cities have divested their taxi enterprises or have plans&#13;
to do so. Two cities have not divested intercity services but have plans to do so by December&#13;
31, 1995. All cities indicated that they have removed significant barriers to entry of private firms&#13;
willing to provide urban transport services. All cities also indicate that they intend to prepare&#13;
plans, by September 1, 1996, for contracts with outside enterprises to provide urban transport&#13;
services or auxiliary services (Table 3.9). Through a combination of technical assistance and&#13;
study tours financed by the project, city and transit officials in the project cities will be exposed&#13;
to privatization of bus companies and contracting of services as practiced successfully elsewhere&#13;
in the world. If possible, some of the technical assistance will be organized on a twinning basis&#13;
with cities where such reforms have been implemented successfully.&#13;
3.52       Commitment to the project is already quite strong as a result of the process of self-&#13;
selection of cities to participate as candidates for inclusion in the project and of the process of&#13;
helping to prepare the project. Many of the reforms have already been adopted by the cities.&#13;
Moreover, municipal governments and urban transport companies are looking for ways to&#13;
improve cost recovery and cut back exemptions and riders. Nonetheless, it is clear from previous&#13;
Bank projects in the sector that one of the most difficult areas of success in any urban transport&#13;
project has been that of cost recovery. Approval of tariff increases in a timely fashion is&#13;
essential to the financial viability of urban transport companies but, at the same time, can&#13;
jeopardize any politician's future. To maintain the focus on this essential reform, the reform&#13;
program will be incorporated into the Subsidiary Loan Agreements (para 8.3).&#13;

municipal governments of the cities they serve. Therefore, it is expected that these municipalities&#13;
will bear the responsibility for repaying the Federal Government for funds borrowed under the&#13;
Bank loan, since responsibility for urban transport operations and financing has been devolved&#13;
to the local level. MOF is in the process of redistributing its financial flows from the center to&#13;
regions, a reversal of traditional patterns of socialist budget management. At the same time, the&#13;
regions, and, in turn, the municipal governments within them, are gradually financing - and&#13;
taking greater responsibility for - an increasing number of sectors such as health insurance,&#13;
social security and welfare, housing and utilities, local transportation and communication,&#13;
kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, retraining, food subsidies, culture, mass media,&#13;
agriculture, consumer services, and numerous organizations under oblast, city and rayon&#13;
jurisdiction. The municipal governments, in turn, have also begun increasing their financing of&#13;
these sectors.&#13;
3.54       To finance these new responsibilities, the scope of taxing authority and rules&#13;
governing allocation of federal subsidies have been made more explicit, although the&#13;
responsibility for spending in many areas is still shared by several levels of government. On the&#13;
revenue side, federal budget laws in 1992 and 1993 granted most oblasts a 20 percent share of&#13;
the value-added tax, 69 percent of the tax on corporate profits (22 percent of profits), 100&#13;
percent of personal income tax, about half of the excise tax on alcohol and oil products, and all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                         Chapter m&#13;
local taxes. Some regions gained the right to retain up to 50 percent of the VAT; the average&#13;
VAT share retained by the regions was 24.4 percent in 1992.&#13;
3.55      A department of the Federal Tax Service collects all federal and regional taxes, as&#13;
well as revenues destined for extra-budgetary road funds. Payments to other extra-budgetary&#13;
funds are collected independently by the management of those funds, apparently including&#13;
collection of a one percent payroll tax to help finance urban transport losses. On the expenditure&#13;
side, the assignment of responsibility of expenditures is apparently far less transparent, and there&#13;
is significant overlap among local, regional, federal, and other budgets in many areas. Some&#13;
cities also have a lower level of government (rayon) that also have their own budgets.&#13;
3.56      Because of inflation, adjustments in budget authority are generally made quarterly.&#13;
But this is not adequate to maintain service levels when the actual subsidy payment is based on&#13;
the previous quarter's actual spending, as is usually the case. In the current inflationary&#13;
situation, this causes serious operational problems.&#13;
3.57      When the federal government fails to meet its financial obligations on time, the&#13;
oblast must spend its own funds. This happened quite frequently in 1993, for example, when&#13;
students scholarships were raised and when federal employees received a pay increase. This&#13;
practice boils down to a forced, interest free advance from the oblast to the federal government.&#13;
In turn, regional governments pay themselves back by withholding tax revenue transfers to the&#13;
federal budget. This extremely inefficient way of solving budget conflicts exacerbates the public&#13;
finance situation and hampers an orderly decentralization process. Although a presidential decree&#13;
issued on October 27, 1993, imposes sanctions on regions that fail to transfer tax revenue to the&#13;
federal budget, the problem will remain if the federal government continues its sequestering&#13;
budget practice.&#13;
3.58      At the municipal level, city governments submit their budget requirements to the&#13;
oblast government and after discussion and agreement on the requirements, the oblast&#13;
government allocates revenues. A large proportion of city revenues are funded from the oblast&#13;
share of federal taxes: only a small share is funded from municipal taxes. However, the type and&#13;
level of municipal tax has to be approved by the oblast government. With such a large share of&#13;
revenues dependent on the collection and release of federal taxes, the municipal governments&#13;
are caught up in the same budget conflicts as the oblast and federal governments.&#13;
3.59      Against this backdrop of ad hoc relationships, there will be a formal subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement between the Federal Government and the project city governments that would govern&#13;
the onlending terms of the Bank loan made to the Federal Government for funds borrowed on&#13;
behalf of city-owned urban transport companies. The oblast governments of which the&#13;
participating cities are a part of will sign as guarantors of the loans in view of the dependency&#13;
of municipal governments upon oblast governments for financial resources. The final language&#13;
of any onlending agreement for the project is still under discussion among governmental&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter Im                                                                       37&#13;
3.60      Two fundamental issues emerge: (a) the seriousness with which the city governments&#13;
will view the onlending agreement in light of the current negotiating budgetary environment; and&#13;
(b) the ability of the municipalities to take on and service a long-term hard currency debt.&#13;
3.61      MOF insisted on the guarantee of the oblast government for each project city's loan&#13;
given the oblast's leverage over the cities and access to greater financial resources. As for as&#13;
the ability of the cities to repay the debt, the World Bank undertook to assess the current&#13;
financial condition of the candidate cities and their ability to absorb a loan sufficient to finance&#13;
the cost of purchasing the buses and transport vehicles needed on the basis of passenger demand.&#13;
3.62      Municipal Budgets. If financing for the loan is to be repaid from city budgets,&#13;
therefore, it is useful to try to assess the ability of the cities to service the loan's debt from&#13;
municipal budgets. To this end, municipal budgets of the candidate cities have been analyzed.&#13;
A comparison of each candidate city's budget expenditures to those of their urban transport&#13;
companies in 1993 are shown in Table 3.10.&#13;
3.63      Three cities had an overall deficit budget in 1993 - Novgorod, Samara, and&#13;
Vologda - while several cities reported a balanced budget or a small surplus. Even so, those&#13;
cities with budget surpluses cannot be said to have much margin for increasing expenditures.&#13;
Some of the cities might be able to appeal to their oblast governments for more funds but here&#13;
too, there are problems. Of the three cities with deficit budgets, only Samara comes from an&#13;
oblast which had a budget surplus in 1992 (latest year for which data is available - see column&#13;
2 of Table 3.10).&#13;
3.64      As pressures to absorb more and more services are added to the responsibilities of&#13;
oblast and local governments, however, these surpluses may disappear. This trend is evident&#13;
from a detailed review of expenditures covered by city budgets. Expenses for central heating,&#13;
housing, kindergartens and education have increased significantly, in some cases by more than&#13;
the inflation rate from 1992 to 1993 (estimated at 10 times between mid-1992 and mid-1993).&#13;
For example, housing expenses increased by 21.7 times in Tver from 1992 to 1993 while Tver's&#13;
total revenues and total expenses increased by only 15.3 times; transport subsidies in Tver&#13;
increased 16.4 times in comparison. In Vologda, housing expenses increased 134 times&#13;
compared to transport increases of 15 times and overall budget revenues and expenses increased&#13;
10 times. In Rostov, on the other hand, transport subsidies increased 32.1 times compared to&#13;
revenue increases of 11.9 times.&#13;
3.65      What does this mean for the cities' ability to absorb more expenditure for transport?&#13;
Table 3.10 also shows the total operating subsidies currently provided (both oblast and local&#13;
where relevant). As shown therein, subsidies for transport operating losses (excluding capital)&#13;
average 8.3 percent of total municipal expenditures, ranging from less than one percent for&#13;
Pskov and Velikie Luki (which get all of their subsidies at the oblast level) to 14.9 percent for&#13;
Samara. Actual data for 1994 (see Table 6.2) indicates that transit subsidies ranged from 7.8&#13;
percent to 18.2 percent of municipal expenditures in the first half of 1994. Given the mounting&#13;
pressure on budgets for other sector expenditures, an analysis was made of what subsidy level&#13;
would be needed, as a percent of city expenditures, if cost recovery from transport revenues had&#13;
been 50 percent in 1993 rather than the average of 11.8 percent. The results, shown in the last&#13;

principal and interest on the Bank loan more feasible. Clearly, therefore, there is adequate&#13;
scope to support additional transport costs, which would be required if the candidate cities&#13;
were made responsible for the loan, provided the cities and their urban transport&#13;
companies take all measures to improve cost recovery of present transport operations.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
IV. WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE IN URBAN TRANSPORT, AND IN RUSSIA&#13;
A. BANK EXPERENCE IN URBAN TRANSPORT&#13;
4.1       Compared to many other sectors, urban transport has not been a major area of&#13;
World Bank activity. Yet, since 1972, the World Bank has had about thirty urban transport&#13;
projects and an even larger number of urban development projects with a substantial urban&#13;
transport component. These projects have been quite diversified in terms of content, countries,&#13;
and circumstances under which they have been designed and implemented. The major objective&#13;
of World Bank lending for urban transport has been to improve and extend available facilities&#13;
and services through the use of low cost options. For this reason, by far the greatest emphasis&#13;
has been placed on: (i) rationalization of the use of urban transport facilities, particularly urban&#13;
roads; (ii) provision of better access through upgrading and extension of the road networks; and&#13;
(iii) improvement in the standards and viability of public transport services. A more general&#13;
objective has been to meet the special needs of the urban poor. Upgrading and extending road&#13;
networks in low income neighborhoods has therefore also been a priority as well as improving&#13;
the public transport services benefitting the poor. Other objectives of World Bank urban&#13;
transport operations have been to improve planning and coordination and to better integrate&#13;
urban transport with urban development. More recently, Bank objectives have focussed on the&#13;
privatization of urban transport, including contracting out maintenance and other services, but&#13;
most of the projects incorporating these objectives are ongoing projects.&#13;
4.2       By mid 1991, Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and in many cases Project&#13;
Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) had been prepared for about fifteen urban transport projects&#13;
or urban development projects with a large urban transport component (above 30 percent of&#13;
costs). The main lessons of experience are summarized below.&#13;
4.3       With the exception of the Bangkok Urban Transport Project (UTP) which was&#13;
significantly changed in scope, physical components of urban transport projects were generally&#13;
implemented as planned. While some changes did take place and some components were poorly&#13;
planned, the physical components proposed at appraisal proved to be feasible and supported by&#13;
decision makers. Overall estimated project costs were also of the right order although wide&#13;
variations in individual components occurred.&#13;
4.4       Institutional arrangements and components were considerably less successful,&#13;
however. Many projects established traffic and transport units to plan, design and supervise&#13;
improvement schemes. The PCR/PPARs make reference to the political problems of maintaining&#13;
the units, of giving the units sufficient authority to act, of staffing the units, of obtaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                         Chapter IV&#13;
adequately trained staff and of sustaining those units after the implementation of a project. In&#13;
particular, the institutional problems of sustaining traffic management momentum and capabilities&#13;
have not yet been solved. Many of the PCR/PPARs cite lack of enforcement of traffic&#13;
regulations as reason for failure of traffic management schemes. Indeed, more attention should&#13;
have been paid to improving police operations. In some cities, despite the implementation of&#13;
physical schemes, there was a lack of long term commitment to accept traffic management&#13;
measures and subsequent changes in political administration rejected the traffic management&#13;
approach.&#13;
4.5        Transport policy measures were included in some, but not all projects. The results&#13;
were mixed. For example, some failures were recorded in:&#13;
a)   Kuala Lumpur Second UTP and Bangkok UTP with respect to road pricing;&#13;
b)   Calcutta and Cote d'Ivoire Second UTP with respect to bus fares; and&#13;
c)   Brazil Third UTP studies for bus deregulation and maintenance.&#13;
But sbme policy measures were also at least partly successfully implemented, for example in:&#13;
a)   Kuala Lumpur Second UTP with respect to increases in bus fares;&#13;
b)   Bombay UTP and Madras Urban Project with respect to increases in bus fares,&#13;
although the increases were not enough to meet covenanted agreements regarding&#13;
revenue/cost ratios.&#13;
4.6       A number of projects (Bombay, Madras, Cote d'Ivoire and Calcutta) invested in&#13;
public bus or monopoly bus operations (often supplying buses). Except in Calcutta, all the&#13;
companies were relatively efficient with, for example, availability of the fleet of the order of 90&#13;
percent and reasonable staffing ratios. All companies made operational improvements during&#13;
project implementation. Nevertheless, Government was reluctant to allow bus fares to rise&#13;
adequately to meet agreed revenue/cost ratios (covenanted under the loans) and for financial&#13;
targets to be met, demonstrating the political difficulties of raising fares.&#13;
4.7       Project schedules were always over-optimistic at appraisal. This appears to have&#13;
resulted from some, or all, of the following factors: (i) the difficulties of implementing traffic&#13;
schemes; (ii) failure to complete final designs in a timely manner; (iii) unfamiliarity with World&#13;
Bank procedures (especially procurement); and (iv) lack of counterpart funds.&#13;
4.8       Although the project is quite different from most of the World Bank's previous&#13;
urban transport projects - it does not include any civil works or traffic management schemes -&#13;
the lessons of World Bank experience have been taken into account in its design.&#13;
Implementation delays are expected to be minimized because: (i) procurement will be well&#13;
advanced by the time the project goes to the Board for approval, and the bids for the buses and&#13;
trolleybuses should be being evaluated by the time of loan effectiveness; (ii) experience of&#13;
procuring bus spare parts has already been gained under the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 3513-RU);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IV                                                                         43&#13;
and (iii) MOT has already established a Project Implementation Directorate (PID) to manage the&#13;
project and carry out procurement and local project implementing units have already been&#13;
established in the project cities.&#13;
4.9        Cost recovery should improve because of (i) up front cost recovery targets that have&#13;
been met by the cities included in the project (the transit companies have already achieved 25&#13;
percent cost recovery) and (ii) cost recovery targets throughout the project (35 percent by&#13;
December 1, 1995, 40 percent by March 31, 1996 and 50 percent by end of the project).&#13;
However, two-thirds of the cities have already reached 40 percent cost recovery for bus&#13;
operations. Initial institutional development targets will have been met by the time of loan&#13;
effectiveness, insofar as autonomous transit companies will have been established, and additional&#13;
conditionality will be linked to making more progress on institutional issues by the middle of the&#13;
project. The training and technical assistance has also been designed to support the&#13;
Government's policies and project companies' programs. Despite these project features, some&#13;
risks remain. In particular, targets for cost recovery will depend on political will and the ability&#13;
of passengers to pay. Risks are discussed further in Chapter VII.&#13;
B. LESSONS FROM OTHER BANK OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA&#13;
4.10       Lessons learned from the First Oil Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 3620-RU) and other&#13;
loans in Russia highlight the importance of: (a) identifying a consistent committed counterpart&#13;
team with sufficient authority to move the project forward; (b) coordinating among key&#13;
interested parties at the federal and regional levels on critical or controversial project issues; (c)&#13;
early detailed attention to procurement and other implementation issues; and (d) involving local&#13;
consultants and institutes in the process. The design of the project has taken account of these&#13;
issues with plans for procurement and implementation of the project and involvement of the&#13;
candidate cities and NIIAT in the preparation of the project.&#13;
4.11       The urban transport sector was one of five sectors to benefit from the Bank's first&#13;
loan to Russia, the First Rehabilitation Loan, which financed US$41 million for procurement&#13;
of critically-needed imports necessary to maintain urban transport fleets in selected cities. The&#13;
procurement and distribution system worked quite well and the same distribution entity&#13;
"Avtosnabsbyt" will be used under the project for the national spare parts component. A major&#13;
lesson learned from the loan was that the transit companies need to be more involved in the&#13;
procurement process for the spare parts rather than the municipal governments who provided the&#13;
funds, so as to ensure that the required spare parts are purchased. During project preparation,&#13;
Bank consultants worked closely with the bus and electric transport companies in the selected&#13;
cities to identify needs, and technical assistance to be provided under the project will continue&#13;
to liaise with the cities and monitor their needs and performance.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RussiAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND PREPARATION&#13;
5.1       The World Bank carried out a limited review of urban services in several selected&#13;
cities in order to identify potential areas for World Bank assistance as part of the development&#13;
of the initial lending program for Russia. The conclusions of this review were that the urban&#13;
transport sector was one of the highest priorities for municipalities in view of the declining&#13;
availability of urban transport vehicles and lack of funds for replacement of transport fleets.&#13;
Discussions were held with MOT which supported World Bank assistance for urban transport&#13;
in a selected number of cities, especially since the Government's policy to devolve responsibility&#13;
for all urban transport operations to the local level and to reduce federal fiscal support for the&#13;
sector was resulting in severe financial hardship for the public transport entities.&#13;
5.2        To date, MOT has assumed overall responsibility for the project, although MOF will&#13;
have to bear the responsibility for: (a) borrowing from the World Bank on behalf of the cities;&#13;
and (b) ensuring that effective onlending arrangements are in place with the cities on whose&#13;
behalf the loan is being made. Cities were self-selecting insofar as they applied for inclusion in&#13;
the project on the understanding that they would have to fulfill the agreed reform program. The&#13;
first part of project preparation was funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency&#13;
(USTDA). The funds were used to hire transport consultants to assist in project preparation and&#13;
to contract NIIAT, the Russian Automobile Transport Institute, to: (a) hold seminars with the&#13;
participating cities to explain the objectives of the project; (b) discuss and negotiate with the&#13;
cities the reforms to be carried out by participating cities in order to be included in the project;&#13;
(c) assist the cities with the preparation of their initial submissions to MOT and the World Bank&#13;
for inclusion in the project; and (d) prepare urban transport operational guidelines. USTDA&#13;
funding also enabled MOT officials to visit bus manufacturing companies in the United States&#13;
and hold discussions with the World Bank in Washington on the project scope's and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.3       The second phase of project preparation was funded by the Government of the&#13;
Netherlands to contract Dutch consultants to: (a) review the city's submissions and evaluate the&#13;
requirements for urban transport vehicles in each city; (b) identify technical assistance and&#13;
training needs for each city to improve operations and the organization framework for urban&#13;
transport; and (c) assess the economic and financial rate of return of investment requests for each&#13;
city. Financing from the UK assisted with the review of the project cities' cost recovery ratios&#13;
to verify that they had met the target set as a condition of negotiations. Lastly, a Canadian grant&#13;
financed a small team to assess the potential for rehabilitation of the cities' existing urban&#13;
transport vehicle fleet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                                                                            Chapter V&#13;
B. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
5.4        Urban transport services have been steadily declining over the past few years given&#13;
the deteriorating budgetary situation at both federal and local levels of government. At least for&#13;
the next three years, it is unlikely that government budgetary resources will be available to&#13;
replace the rapidly ageing urban transport vehicle fleet or that revenues will be increased&#13;
sufficiently quickly to finance the purchase of buses and other vehicles. Because of low cost&#13;
recovery, privatization of transport services will be difficult in the short term because of the&#13;
wide differential in fares for public and privately operated services if private operators are to&#13;
earn a reasonable profit. The financing of fleet replacement and rehabilitation by the World Bank&#13;
will enable the project cities' urban transport companies to improve service to at least a&#13;
minimum satisfactory level and, along with the improvement in service, raise fares to increase&#13;
cost recovery. With higher levels of cost recovery it will be possible to introduce more&#13;
privatization and competition for the provision of urban transport services since private operators&#13;
could not compete with highly subsidized public operators.&#13;
5.5        The project also supports sector restructuring and needed institutional changes such&#13;
as: the devolvement of responsibility for urban transport to municipalities, the breaking-up of&#13;
oblast-wide transport operating and spare part distribution monopolies, the transformation of a&#13;
centrally controlled procurement system and allocation of urban transport vehicles based on&#13;
vehicles per population and MOT judgment, to one based on operational and economic analysis&#13;
and competitive bidding procedures. Although much of the project is limited to fourteen cities,&#13;
the demonstration effects could lead to implementation of the project's reforms throughout the&#13;
country. The Bank's involvement in this project is also expected to play a catalytic role in&#13;
supporting sectoral policy and institutional changes in the urban transport sector at the federal&#13;
level and to enhance our support of the transport sector as a whole. The project is fully&#13;
consistent with the objectives of the most recent CAS (May 19, 1994), since a major focus of&#13;
the core projects of the CAS is the achievement of effective implementation arrangements and&#13;
the addressing of key policy issues in the sector investment project.&#13;
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.6        The proceeds of the loan would be used to help restore capacity in selected cities&#13;
by financing selected fleet replacements and critically needed spare parts and to foster reforms&#13;
that would assist transport entities to maintain and develop their operations on a self-sustaining&#13;
and commercial basis. The reform package would be aimed at substantially reducing subsidies&#13;
before delivery of buses, with a view to their elimination over a period of time. The project&#13;
would serve to demonstrate (a) the benefits of such reform programs to other cities in Russia,&#13;
id (b) how Government support for capital replacement of vehicles could be tied to improved&#13;
cost recovery and other reforms, not only for urban transport but for other sectors as well. Such&#13;
retorms are needed on a national level to reduce urban transport losses which were about six&#13;
percent of GDP in 1993. The project would also help improve the quality of life of the urban&#13;
population in the project cities by reducing waiting time and overcrowding on buses and electric&#13;
transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                          47&#13;
5.7       Importing vehicles for urban transport is only a short term solution to Russia's&#13;
continual urban transport vehicle replacement requirements. It is important that municipalities&#13;
be able to purchase locally manufactured buses at prices significantly less than imported bus&#13;
prices (given the low cost of labor and other inputs), especially since it is unlikely that urban&#13;
transport services will be wholly self-financing for many years. Therefore, the project will&#13;
examine the potential for private sector financing of the bus manufacturing industry.&#13;
5.8        The objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(i)  preserve essential urban transport capacity in fourteen cities by linking financing of&#13;
urgently needed replacement vehicles and spare parts to the implementation of&#13;
reforms;&#13;
(ii) strengthen the fourteen project cities' urban transport sector institutions so as to&#13;
improve the efficiency of passenger transport operations;&#13;
(iii) arrest the decline of urban transport services in cities throughout Russia through the&#13;
provision of urgently needed spare parts for transport vehicles; and&#13;
(iv) provide restructuring advice for the domestic bus industry.&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
5.9        The project includes the fourteen cities that have achieved a 25 percent cost recovery&#13;
target by end-July 1994 and have committed to implementing the rest of the reform program.&#13;
The project cities are Cherepovets, Kostroma, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novgorod, Omsk, Pskov,&#13;
Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Saransk, Smolensk, Tver, Velikie Luki, Vologda and Yekaterinburg.&#13;
Major components of the project would consist of the provision of new urban transport vehicles,&#13;
spare parts and technical assistance and training in the project cities. The project will also assist&#13;
other cities throughout Russia through the provision of spare parts for public transport vehicles&#13;
and provide assistance for MOT to develop more appropriate urban transport policies and include&#13;
a study on how to develop a private domestic urban transport vehicles manufacturing industry.&#13;
5.10       The project is based upon the investment program for the project cities from 1995&#13;
through 1997, including buses and trolleybuses financed by both the Bank loan and local&#13;
government funds. Vehicles to be purchased with local funds include used or new Ikarus buses&#13;
(some of which are locally assembled), other imported secondhand buses and a few domestically&#13;
produced smaller buses. Altogether, the project will finance about 81 percent of the total cost&#13;
of the cities' investment in bus and trolleybus acquisitions.&#13;
5.11       The main components of the project are:&#13;
(a)  Assistance for fourteen selected cities including:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                                                           Chapter V&#13;
(i)   bus and trolleybus fleet replacement, including the purchase of 2,154 buses&#13;
and 509 trolleybuses, of which the World Bank will finance 1,501 buses&#13;
and 272 trolleybuses;&#13;
(ii)   rehabilitation of 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses, and 380 trams;&#13;
(iii)   provision of workshop, computers and other equipment for urban transport&#13;
companies, plus a fare collection system to be tested in one of the project&#13;
cities; and&#13;
(iv)   technical assistance and training to assist the cities implement reforms,&#13;
rehabilitate transit vehicles and assist with procurement and monitoring of&#13;
the project;&#13;
(b)     Assistance for MOT including:&#13;
(i)   purchase of ten natural gas buses to be tested as part of a pilot project;&#13;
(ii)   purchase of equipment for the Project Implementation Directorate (PID);&#13;
(iii)   studies of, and restructuring advice for, the domestic urban transport vehicle&#13;
manufacturing industry; and&#13;
(iv)   technical assistance and training to assist MOT develop more appropriate&#13;
urban transport policies and help expand the reform program to other cities&#13;
throughout Russia;&#13;
(c)     Provision of spare parts for urban transport companies throughout Russia.&#13;
(i) Assistance for Selected Cities&#13;
5.12       New Urban Transport Vehicles. The buses and trolleybuses included in each of the&#13;
fourteen project cities' investment programs will replace existing vehicles that are either beyond&#13;
their economic life or beyond repair. The investment program is based on the replacement&#13;
requirements for fourteen cities over a three year period. The existing fleet of mainly Hungarian&#13;
and Russian-made vehicles (Russia produces smaller buses and trolleybuses) is ageing and a&#13;
large percentage of vehicles need to be written off over the next three years. The existing fleet&#13;
of vehicles has a shorter life compared to Western buses, plus lower availability, primarily&#13;
because the vehicles have not been treated against corrosion, have lower quality engines and&#13;
generally lower quality of construction. Buses to be financed under the Bank loan will have a&#13;
longer life, higher availability, require fewer spare parts, be more fuel-efficient, thus making&#13;
considerably less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon pollution, especially since they will replace&#13;
over 1,000 gasoline-fueled buses in the present fleet with new diesel-fueled buses complying&#13;
with more stringent emission standards.&#13;

5.13       Proceeds from  the loan will finance about 1,501 diesel fueled buses and 272&#13;
trolleybuses at an estimated cost of US$223.7 million; 653 buses and 237 trolleybuses will be&#13;
procured locally by the cities using their own funding and procurement procedures (for an&#13;
estimated cost of US$53 million). The Bank loan will finance 851 twelve meter buses and 650&#13;
articulated buses.&#13;
5.14       The buses have been allocated to the cities based on an evaluation of their&#13;
requirements. Technical specifications for the buses have been based on a modified version of&#13;
existing buses, including an improved engine, rustproofing and other features that will extend&#13;
the life of the bus and lead to more fuel efficiency. Trolleybus specifications have been based&#13;
on modified technical specifications for the existing fleet. Specifications for buses and&#13;
trolleybuses were substantially agreed by the Bank, MOT and the project cities during&#13;
negotiations, and any subsequent changes will require Bank approval (para 8.1). Details of&#13;
buses to be financed by the Bank by city are given in Table 5. 1. Additional details are given in&#13;
Annex 5.1.&#13;
5.15       Rehabilitation and Spare Partsfor Urban Transport Vehicles. According to appraisal&#13;
estimates, about 20 percent of the cities' bus fleet, 19 percent of the trolleybus fleet, and 17&#13;
percent of the tram fleet will require rehabilitation over a three year period. To meet these&#13;
needs, the project will include the rehabilitation of 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses, and 380 trams&#13;
at an estimated cost of US$40.9 million. Rehabilitation works include repair and reinforcement&#13;
of vehicle frames, replacement of body panels, moldings and flooring, replacement of engines,&#13;
transmission systems, clutches, suspension and steering components, corrosion prevention and&#13;
painting of vehicles. The project will finance spare parts for the rehabilitation works which will&#13;
be carried out in-house or by direct contract. The list of spare parts for each year's rehabilitation&#13;
program will be finalized with the assistance of the vehicle rehabilitation technical assistance&#13;
team (para 5.20) and submitted for Bank approval before procurement taking place. Details of&#13;
vehicles to be rehabilitated by city are given in Table 5.1 (for costs) and Annex 5.1 (for number&#13;
of vehicles) and more details of the rehabilitation program are given in Annex 5.2.&#13;
5.16       Equipment. Urban transport companies workshop and other equipment are&#13;
inadequate for the efficient operation of urban transport services in the cities. In particular, there&#13;
could be substantial improvement of maintenance operations if the urban transport companies&#13;
were provided with paint booths, welders, steam cleaners, sandblasters, machine shop tools and&#13;
hand tools. Operations would also be improved if there were more computers for such activities&#13;
as route planning and scheduling, inventory control, and accounting and cost control. In order&#13;
to improve fare collection to reduce the level of fare evasion, the project will include a fare&#13;
collection system for one city (Vologda) as a pilot study after a careful review of alternative&#13;
systems. The total cost of all the fare collection, workshop, computer and other equipment is&#13;
estimated at about US$8.7 million. The list of equipment will be finalized with the assistance&#13;
of the vehicle rehabilitation technical assistance team (para 5.20) and submitted for Bank&#13;
approval before procurement taking place.&#13;
5.17       Technical Assistance. The project will include a technical assistance and training&#13;
program to: (a) assist with the procurement and administration of the project; (b) assist the&#13;
project companies to implement the vehicle rehabilitation program; and (c) assist the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                          51&#13;
cities and their transport enterprises to implement the agreed upon reform programs and improve&#13;
operational performance. The estimated cost of the technical assistance and training is US$8.3&#13;
million. Further details are given in para 5.20.&#13;
(ii) Assistance to MOT&#13;
5.18       The project will include ten natural gas fueled buses to be tested on a pilot basis&#13;
in Moscow to determine their suitability for conditions in Russia, for a total cost of US$1.5&#13;
million. A small amount (US$0.2 million) is also included in the project for equipment for the&#13;
PID. The project will also include a technical assistance and training program for MOT to: (a)&#13;
help develop a private sector strategy for a domestic urban transport vehicle manufacturing&#13;
industry; (b) assist MOT to develop an overall strategy for the urban transport sector; and&#13;
(c) extend the reform program to other cities in Russia. The cost of this component is estimated&#13;
to be US$4.6 million. Further details of technical assistance included in the project are given in&#13;
para 5.20.&#13;
(iii) National Spare Parts Program&#13;
5.19       Given the deteriorating urban transport services throughout Russia, the project will&#13;
include a component to provide urgently needed spare parts for buses, trolleybuses and trams&#13;
for cities throughout the Federation, as was provided under the Rehabilitation Project (Ln 3513-&#13;
RU). The spare parts will be used to help put back into service vehicles that would otherwise&#13;
remain idle or only be used in off-peak hours because of their poor condition. MOT will onlend&#13;
to "Avtosnabsbyt", the privatized spare parts distribution company in Nizhniy Novgorod, which&#13;
will be responsible for the sale of the spare parts to users at the purchase price plus the&#13;
distribution center's mark-up. There should be considerable savings from purchasing the spare&#13;
parts in bulk, given the experience of the Rehabilitation Loan where it is estimated that there has&#13;
been a 17 percent saving in costs. The national spare part component is estimated to cost&#13;
US$50.0 million. A final list of spare parts will be submitted to the Bank for approval before&#13;
procurement takes place.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
5.20       It is estimated that about 800 staff months of technical assistance will be required&#13;
to carry out the technical assistance program, of which about 380 months would be foreign and&#13;
420 local. The project is expected to provide training and experience for the domestic consultants&#13;
specializing in urban transport: one local consulting group (NIIAT) has already been heavily&#13;
involved in the preparation of the project. The total cost of the technical assistance and training&#13;
is US$12.9 million. Terms of reference for consultants to be financed under the project will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for final approval before invitations for proposals are requested. For all&#13;
technical assistance and training, the World Bank will make every effort to secure grant funds:&#13;
the EU has agreed already to finance part of the technical assistance to the cities.&#13;

E. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING&#13;
5.21       Costs. The estimated total cost of the project amounts to US$391 million, excluding&#13;
taxes. Costs were estimated as of March 1995. The foreign component amounts to US$346.1&#13;
million or 89 percent of the total cost. Duties and taxes are expected to amount to about US$11&#13;
million (mostly in the form of administrative charges for imported goods). Government has&#13;
exempted all buses used for public transportation from import duties. Cities are required to pay&#13;
VAT when purchasing vehicles and spare parts, but are reimbursed within one month through&#13;
the budgetary process. A summary of the costs of the project are given in Table 5.2 and detailed&#13;
cost estimates are given in Annex 5.7.&#13;
5.22       The total estimated cost of the fourteen cities' investment programs for vehicle&#13;
replacement, rehabilitation and equipment is US$326.6 million, including US$241.6 million for&#13;
new buses and US$35.2 million for trolleybuses. The cost of new vehicles to be financed by the&#13;
Bank loan, including a two years supply of spare parts, is estimated at US$198.4 million for&#13;
buses based on recent bids for similar Bank-financed buses and US$25.3 million for trolleybuses&#13;
based on recent FSU country prices. The unit cost of a 12 meter bus is estimated at US$117,000&#13;
and an articulated bus at US$160,000 (including spares). The unit cost of trolleybuses is&#13;
US$95,000 (the low cost of trolleybuses reflects the low price of the existing fleet of mostly&#13;
Russian-made trolleybuses). The estimated cost of US$40.9 million for the project cities' vehicle&#13;
rehabilitation programs is based on the cost of spare parts and transit companies' workshop costs&#13;
where the work is to be done in-house and contract costs where the work is to be contracted out.&#13;
The total cost of US$50 million for spare parts the national spare part component is based on&#13;
recent experience with the purchase of spare parts for transport vehicles purchased under the&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. The cost of technical assistance and training (US$12.9 million) is based&#13;
on recent experience of consultants working in Russia and training costs both overseas and&#13;
locally.&#13;
5.23      Financing. The World Bank loan of US$329 million would finance 84 percent of&#13;
project costs, including 81 percent of the costs of the new vehicles, 82 percent of the cost of&#13;
rehabilitation, 100 percent of the cost of workshop equipment and other equipment, 100 percent&#13;

of the cost of the national spare parts program, and 86 percent of the cost of technical assistance.&#13;
The EU has agreed to finance US$1.8 million of technical assistance and other donors are being&#13;
requested to finance some of the other technical assistance costs. The project city governments&#13;
and transport companies are financing US$62 million, or 15 percent of total project costs.&#13;
Provision for retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 million has been included in the loan to&#13;
finance essential procurement and project management assistance since the bids for buses and&#13;
trolleybuses should be submitted before loan effectiveness. The financing plan is given in&#13;
Table 5.3.&#13;
F. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.24      The Russian Federation will be the Borrower and will onlend to the 14 project cities&#13;
which will pass on the funds as a grant to the local transport companies. The Bank has formally&#13;
acknowledged Declarations of Commitment signed by all 14 project cities detailing the vehicles,&#13;
parts and equipment to be financed under the project and elements of the reform program. The&#13;
undertakings in the Declarations of Commitment will become legally binding on the project cities&#13;
and their oblasts once the Government has executed Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the cities.&#13;
MOT will have overall responsibility for implementing the project and coordinating the work&#13;
of the cities which each will be responsible for certain project aspects. To undertake this&#13;
responsibility, the Government has established an Urban Transport Project Coordinating Council&#13;
(the Council) to provide project policy and a PID to undertake the administrative, procurement&#13;
and supervision functions. Details of the Directorate's functions are included in Annex 5.8,&#13;
together with the TOR for the Project Director (PD). As cities are the main beneficiaries of the&#13;
loan through the sub-loan agreements, both the Council's makeup and the PID's functions will&#13;
rely heavily on city input. While the Council chairperson is the Director of the Automobile&#13;
Department of MOT, two deputy chairpersons have been nominated by the cities and city&#13;
personnel will sit on the Council. At the local level, each city has designated a city project&#13;
manager to manage and coordinate the project at the city level, and be the focal point for&#13;
communications with the PID. The respective responsibilities of the PID and the cities will be&#13;
covered in the city Subsidiary Loan Agreements.&#13;
5.25      Working through the Council, the PID will be responsible for: (a) procurement,&#13;
monitoring and coordination of project implementation and resolution of implementation&#13;
problems; (b) liaison with the city authorities and transport companies; (c) supervision and&#13;
monitoring of project cities' compliance with the conditions of the Subsidiary Agreements and&#13;
preparing monthly and annual project audits for MOF; (d) ensuring that spare parts are&#13;
distributed to urban transport companies under the national component; (e) managing the&#13;
project's technical assistance; (f) disbursement and financial recording of the project; and (g)&#13;
reporting requirements for the Bank (including statistics on the operation and financial&#13;
performance of the urban transport companies included in the project).&#13;
5.26      The PID is headed by the PD and Deputy PD who have already been appointed.&#13;
They will be assisted by three Unit Chiefs and four other staff drawn from MOT with further&#13;
assistance from visiting city staff. The PD will also be assisted by a Project Adviser (PA)&#13;
financed under the project; the PA will provide advice and assistance to the cities and transport&#13;
companies and the latter's procurement units. The PA will be an individual, possibly provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                                                                        Chapter V&#13;
by a firm which will provide additional services on an "as and when required" basis. Among&#13;
its other tasks, the PID will be responsible for procurement and accounting administration,&#13;
including disbursement. Technical assistance also will be contracted by the PID, but will be&#13;
under the direction of the Council. The terms of reference for the PID, PA and procurement&#13;
services are included in Annex 5.9.&#13;
5.27      In undertaking procurement tasks, the PID would perform the functions of a service&#13;
organization providing procurement and coordination services to the cities for the procurement&#13;
of new vehicles, spare parts and equipment, and to MOT for the procurement of spare parts for&#13;
urban transport authorities throughout Russia. The PID would respond to city requests and be&#13;
responsible for facilitating procurement, including: (a) finalization and issuance of bidding&#13;
documents in accordance with city and World Bank requirements; (b) facilitation of bid opening&#13;
with, in the case of buses, a city official present on the bid opening commission; and (c)&#13;
facilitation of a bid evaluation committee which, in the case of the buses, would have majority&#13;
representation from the concerned cities who would sign award recommendations to the World&#13;
Bank: the bid evaluation committee would be headed by the Chairperson of the Coordinating&#13;
Council. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on maintenance of&#13;
the Council and the PID within MOT, responsibilities of the Council and the PID, adequate&#13;
staffing of the PJD, and retention of a PD with qualifications and experience satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank (para 8.1).&#13;
5.28      Transport Companies Will Have Their Own Procurement Units. Through the city&#13;
project manager, the city transport companies' procurement units (known locally as Purchase&#13;
and Supply Departments) will be responsible for local procurement, perhaps some international&#13;
procurement of spare parts, and for all rehabilitation work. These units will be provided with&#13;
procurement assistance and training from the PID.&#13;
5.29      The transport companies in the selected cities will be responsible for the&#13;
rehabilitation of buses, trolleybuses and trams. Rehabilitation of urban transport vehicles will&#13;
either be carried out by direct contract or in-house. Additional workshop equipment and tools&#13;
will be financed under the project where necessary to assist the urban transport companies to&#13;
carry, out the rehabilitation works. A detailed rehabilitation plan for each urban transport&#13;
company was agreed at negotiations and included in the Declarations of Commitment (para&#13;
8.5). These plans will assist the PID in consolidating the procurement of spare parts for&#13;
rehabilitation of vehicles and contracting out of rehabilitation works. The rehabilitation program&#13;
will be reviewed by the vehicle rehabilitation technical assistance team after a detailed review&#13;
of each cities' fleet of vehicles, and spare parts, workshop equipment and vehicle rehabilitation&#13;
contract requirements will be reassessed. The transport companies will also provide MOT with&#13;
all the information and technical support required to carry out the responsibilities of MOT set&#13;
forth above. Organization charts for project implementation organization are given in Annex&#13;
5.10. The Bank, MOF, MOT, the project cities and the transport companies have agreed the&#13;
duties and responsibilities to be performed by central and local governments. Details of the&#13;
implementation schedule (Annex 5.11) were also agreed during negotiations.&#13;
5.30      Although the loan for this project may not become effective until September of&#13;
1995, project implementation needs to start as soon as possible to award some contracts as soon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                       57&#13;
as the loan becomes effective. Therefore, consultant services to assist the PID with the&#13;
evaluation of bids for the buses and trolleybuses and preparation of bidding documents for other&#13;
project components will be financed under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Bidding&#13;
documents with the technical specifications for the new buses and trolleybuses were substantially&#13;
agreed during negotiations. The PID should have signed a contract with a frm or firms to&#13;
provide project management and procurement services as a condition of loan effectiveness&#13;
(para 8.5). If financed under the loan, the firm will have been selected in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
5.31      Technical assistance will be provided to assist the project municipal regulatory&#13;
authorities and urban transport entities to institute measures to implement reforms, meet project&#13;
monitorable targets, improve operating efficiencies, organization and management of workshop&#13;
and maintenance facilities, and to draw up incentives based on contracts between cities and&#13;
contract entities to further reduce subsidies and costs. The project monitorable targets (Annex&#13;
5.12) have been agreed by the Bank and the Government and will be included in the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement. Performance indicators will be based on implementation of the reform program&#13;
which is to be included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Consultants will be engaged to help&#13;
Government prepare a strategy for the further development of a private sector urban transport&#13;
vehicle manufacturing industry, to translate lessons and replicate the project elsewhere in Russia,&#13;
and develop ways of deepening private sector involvement and further reform of the sector&#13;
(para 5.20).&#13;
5.32 ,    Onlending. The onlending arrangements are for the Bank loan to be passed on by&#13;
MOF as loans to the project city governments which in turn will pass on the goods and services&#13;
financed under the loan as grants to the urban transport companies in view of the companies'&#13;
inability to repay. The subsidiary loans will carry an interest rate 200 basis points above the&#13;
primary loan's interest rate, for terms of 15 years, with five years' grace. The interest spread&#13;
will cover MOF's costs of administrating the subsidiary loans but will be somewhat lower than&#13;
the long-term market rate for capital in Russia for revenue-earning entities because the project&#13;
beneficiaries are engaged in loss-making public service operations and their municipal owners&#13;
are under severe budget constraints. The cities will undertake to assume the foreign exchange&#13;
risk. The onlending agreement will involve MOF, oblast governments and the municipal&#13;
governments. MOF wishes oblast governments to be included in the subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
in order to have recourse to the oblast in the event that the cities default on their loan&#13;
repayments. Therefore, oblast governments will be required to guarantee the subsidiary loans&#13;
to cities in their oblast. Confirmation that each project city's oblast government will guarantee&#13;
the subsidiary loan was received by the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
5.33      Proceeds of the Bank loan to finance the purchase of spare parts for other cities&#13;
throughout the country will be financed through a subsidiary loan agreement with the National&#13;
Spare Parts Distribution Center at Nizhniy Novgorod that will carry an interest rate 250 basis&#13;
points above the primary loan's interest rate for a term of one year. Onlending arrangements and&#13;
the terms and conditions of the onlending agreement were agreed during negotiations (para 8.1).&#13;
The signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements by at least five of the project cities will be a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness (para 8.5).&#13;
&#13;

5.34      Project Launch Workshop. Detailed discussions on project implementation were held&#13;
with representatives of the PID and project cities during negotiations. Follow-up discussions&#13;
focussing mainly on the vehicle rehabilitation program, technical assistance and completion of&#13;
the implementation of the reform program will take place during the Project Launch Workshop,&#13;
to be held within three months of loan approval. Procurement of the buses and trolleybuses&#13;
should be underway by the time the Workshop is held. A particular focus of the Workshop will&#13;
be the cities' cost recovery ratios and progress with meeting the 40 percent cost recovery target&#13;
(para 6.6). Important constraints to effective implementation of the project and reform programs&#13;
will be reviewed and discussed, and responsibilities for implementation will be confirmed.&#13;
5.35      A mid-term project review involving the World Bank and relevant Borrower&#13;
agencies will take place in November 1996. The objective of the review will be to assess:&#13;
(a) overall progress of project implementation including buses and trolleybuses procurement and&#13;
distribution of spare parts, technical assistance and training; (b) the extent to which the project&#13;
cities have met the conditions of the project including achieving a cost recovery ratio of 40&#13;
percent by March 31, 1996; (c) performance of MOT and the project city governments and&#13;
urban transport companies; (d) progress with implementation of reform programs; and, (e) need&#13;
for redesigning and/or restructuring of project components. The Bank and the Government&#13;
have agreed on the scope and timing of the mid-term review (para 8.1).&#13;
5.36      The project completion date is December 31, 2000 and the loan closing date would&#13;
be June 30, 2001 to allow sufficient time for the release of security deposits on supply contracts&#13;
where performance guarantees are specified.&#13;
G. PROCuREMENT&#13;
5.37      All Bank-financed items will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines&#13;
(January 1995). Donor financing of some technical assistance assignments will be on a parallel&#13;
basis and procurement will follow donors procurement procedures. Table 5.4 summarizes the&#13;
methods of procurement.' Annex 5.13 contains the procurement schedules.&#13;
5.38      Vehicles, Spare Parts and Equipment. The vehicles, spare parts and equipment to&#13;
be procured under the World Bank loan comprise: (a) two types of buses, one type of trolleybus&#13;
and one type of natural gas bus with spares and special tools; (b) spare parts for the&#13;
rehabilitation of buses, trolleybuses and trams; (c) spare parts for a National Spare Parts&#13;
program; and (d) workshop and computer equipment. For International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB), as detailed below, Russian manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a&#13;
preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing customs duty&#13;
applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided: (i) the manufacturing cost&#13;
includes labor, raw materials and components from the Russian Federation greater than 30&#13;
percent of the ex-works price; and (ii) the production facility has been in operation for at least&#13;
one year prior to the Closing Date for Bids.&#13;

5.39      Buses and Trolleybuses. One thousand five hundred and one diesel engined buses&#13;
and 272 trolleybuses with spares will be procured under the project. The diesel engined buses&#13;
(totalling US$198.4 million) and trolleybuses (totalling US$25.3 million), all with spare parts&#13;
and tools, will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Document for the Procurement of Goods.&#13;
5.40      To facilitate the delivery within the twelve month delivery period, the diesel engined&#13;
bus procurement package comprises ten lots which will be evaluated and awarded separately.&#13;
These lots will also encourage domestic manufacturers to bid - including those who have already&#13;
joint ventured with well known foreign firms. While not evaluated separately, for convenience,&#13;
each pities' requirements are further divided into sub-lots. Where contracts are awarded, each&#13;
city's bus requirements will be delivered directly from the manufacturer(s) to the cities.&#13;
Inspection of the vehicles and their manufacture will be rigorous and will include inspections of&#13;
the manufacturer's(ers') quality assurance program: (a) prior to manufacture; (b) during&#13;
manufacture; (c) prior to delivery; and (d) prior to acceptance. Buses and trolleybuses should&#13;
be procured in one bid package in 1995, unless some of the cities do not meet the 40 percent&#13;
cost recovery target six months prior to signing the contract for the vehicles, in which case buses&#13;
and trolleybuses will be procured in two bid packages for those cities - one in 1995 and one in&#13;
1996 (para 6.6). If required, the second procurement of vehicles would start no later than April&#13;
1996.&#13;
5.41      Given the pilot nature of this component, the natural gas powered buses and support&#13;
services (US$1.5 million) will be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB).&#13;
Expressions of interest and details of experience will be requested through Development Business&#13;
and, after evaluation, bids invited from suppliers at the forefront of natural gas powered&#13;
technology.&#13;
5.42      Rehabilitation. This category provides for the rehabilitation of 997 buses, 327&#13;
trolleybuses and 380 trams. While most transit companies have followed the practice of&#13;
rehabilitating most of their vehicles in-house, there is now a small but growing private transit&#13;
vehicle rehabilitation industry in Russia. On the down side, it is difficult and expensive to move&#13;
trolleybuses and trams any distance, and while some buses have been rehabilitated as far away&#13;
as Poland and Hungary, moving buses that far is unreliable and tends to be both arduous and&#13;
expensive. Thus, contract rehabilitation has been carried out usually at locations closer to the&#13;
transit company. Many of the project cities wish to move to rehabilitation of vehicles by&#13;
contract. Accordingly, some of the most urgent rehabilitation (up to ten vehicles per city) will&#13;
be undertaken through International Shopping for a maximum of US$300,000 per contract (for&#13;
a total of US$4.2 million) using specifications and appropriate bidding documents satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. The remainder of the contract rehabilitation (estimated at US$19.5 million) will be&#13;
undertaken through Limited International Bidding. A number of buses and some unique makes&#13;
of trams and trolleybuses will be rehabilitated by the cities with parts procured by the individual&#13;
cities through International Shopping (up to US$300,000 per contract with an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$3.8 million), National Shopping (up to US$50,000 per contract with an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$5.5 million), and Direct Contracting (aggregate amount of US$600,000). The PID and&#13;
Procurement Services consultants will conduct procurement training and provide procurement&#13;
advice to the cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                            61&#13;
5.43       While most of the vehicles have been identified, the project vehicle rehabilitation&#13;
technical assistance team will confirm with each city the vehicles to be rehabilitated, and the&#13;
procurement method to be used. The team will also assist in the preparation of rehabilitation&#13;
specifications and appropriate bidding documents for contract work for Bank review. Meanwhile,&#13;
the cities can consider commencing rehabilitation of up to ten vehicles as noted above. All lists&#13;
of parts proposed for procurement, with cost estimates, and details of the vehicles to be&#13;
rehabilitated, and the procurement method and documentation will be forwarded for Bank&#13;
approval prior to procurement taking place.&#13;
5.44       National Spare Parts Program. This component comprises spare parts for national&#13;
distribution (US$50.0 million). Following the successful similar procurement and distribution&#13;
under the First Rehabilitation Loan, procurement will be through ICB. The parts will be sold&#13;
to the Russian cities on a commercial basis through a national joint stock distribution company&#13;
(para 5.19). Procurement will be in two rounds (of US$25.0 million each) with bidding for the&#13;
second round taking place only after Avtosnabsbyt has fully repaid to MOF the proceeds&#13;
advanced to it for the first procurement.&#13;
5.45       Workshop and Computer Equipment. This equipment (totalling US$8.9 million) will&#13;
be procured following ICB (US$4.0 million), LIB for the fare collection system (US$1.0&#13;
million), Intemational Shopping (US$2.0 million), National Shopping (US$0.6 million), and Sole&#13;
Source (US$1.3 million).&#13;
5.46       Prior Review. Prior review will be required of all ICB, LIB and Sole Source (direct&#13;
contracting) contracts regardless of value.&#13;
5.47       Technical Assistance. Professional services (consulting services) for technical&#13;
assistance (US$12.9 million) will be provided mostly by firms and, where World Bank financed,&#13;
selected and employed in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The&#13;
principal assignments are:&#13;

5.48       All consultants financed by the World Bank will be contracted using the World&#13;
Bank's standard contract. Proposals will be invited from a shortlist of firms for all assignments&#13;
over an estimated value of US$50,000 and selection will be made on the basis of technical&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
5.49      The World Bank will require for its prior review the assignment terms of reference,&#13;
the method of selection, advertisements, letters of invitation, the proposed selection, prior to the&#13;
invitation of proposals. After consultant negotiations, the World Bank will require for its prior&#13;
review all firms' contracts greater than US$100,000.&#13;
5.50       Procurement administration, monitoring and reporting to the Bank will be computer&#13;
based and undertaken by the PID, with the assistance of the Procurement Advisors. All project&#13;
procurement arrangements have been agreed with the Government with the exception of the&#13;
procurement of trolleybuses. During negotiations the Government expressed the view that&#13;
procurement of trolleybuses through ICB might significantly increase their prices due to a limited&#13;
number of trolleybus manufacturers and requested that direct contracting with a Russian&#13;
company known to have low prices could result in a substantially lower price. It was agreed that&#13;
this matter would be further discussed.&#13;

IBRD loan, and the percentage to&#13;
be financed in each category.&#13;
5.52      To facilitate project implementation, a Special Account (SA) with a maximum&#13;
allocation of US$3 million (with an initial deposit of US$500,000) would be established by the&#13;
Borrower in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the World Bank. The SA&#13;
would be managed by the PID. At the request of the Borrower and, based on the project needs,&#13;
the Bank would make an initial deposit or deposits into the Special Account up to the amount&#13;
of the authorized allocation. Applications for the replenishment of the Special Account would&#13;
be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the usual Bank procedures.&#13;
In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the&#13;
Borrower would accompany all replenishment applications. The commercial bank would be&#13;

selected from a number of acceptable banks, on the basis of competitive bids. Selection criteria&#13;
for participation in the bids are: (a) the bank should be financially sound as demonstrated by&#13;
their latest accounts, as audited by an internationally recognized accounting firm; (b) the bank&#13;
should have a significant foreign correspondence network covering all major currencies; (c) the&#13;
bank should have a reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for maldng&#13;
direct foreign payments and other international transactions, with appropriate arrangements for&#13;
the training and development of their staff; (d) the bank should be capable of performing a wide&#13;
range of local banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks,&#13;
issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance&#13;
of adequate accounts for the SA; (e) the bank should be a member of S.W.I.F.T. (Society for&#13;
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and should routinely use or plan to use this&#13;
facility to expedite payment transfers; (f) the bank should be willing to issue a Comfort Letter&#13;
to assure that amounts deposited in an SA will not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to&#13;
satisfy amounts due to the commercial bank by the borrower; (g) the bank should be willing to&#13;
maintain adequate accounts as required by the World Bank, provide monthly bank statements&#13;
to the World Bank and the PID, and any other information considered necessary. Copies of all&#13;
transactions would be routinely submitted to the PID; and (h) the bank should be willing to&#13;
charge reasonable rates for their services and provide reasonable interest on balances held from&#13;
time to time. The SA will be opened in a commercial bank on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank no later than December 31, 1995 (para 8.1).&#13;
5.53      Each city will receive, through the SA, an advance covering an estimated two&#13;
months of expenditures to cover the purchase of small items (spare parts, etc.) procured through&#13;
international shopping or direct contracting. The amount of the advance will vary with the size&#13;
of the city, but will not exceed US$50,000. The advance will be deposited in an account of the&#13;
choice of the city, but preferably in the branch of the bank holding the SA, if such a branch&#13;
exists. The account will be replenished on a monthly basis.&#13;
5.54      All disbursements under the project, including training and technical assistance,&#13;
would be made against standard full documentation, except that disbursement for goods and&#13;
consultants' contracts each valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent may be claimed under&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) with related documentation retained by MOT for review by&#13;
World Bank supervision missions and independent auditors. During negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that MOF will submit to the World Bank the auditors' report and audited financial statements&#13;
for the SA and SOEs for the preceding calendar year, audited by an independent accountant&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank, by June 30 of each year.&#13;
5.55      Conditions of disbursement are: (i) any disbursements for expenditures incurred by&#13;
the Project cities are conditional upon effectiveness of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements between&#13;
MOF and the cities; (ii) any disbursements for the National Spare Parts component are&#13;
conditional upon effectiveness of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between MOF and&#13;
Avtosnabsbyt. Essential procurement and project management services would be eligible for&#13;
retroactive financing under the loan, not to exceed in total US$1.5 million.&#13;

I. REPORTING, ACCOUNTING, AUDMING AND PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
5.56      The accounting for all SA transactions and for all other project-related accounts will&#13;
be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. An appropriate accounting&#13;
and control system should be operational when project execution begins. Annual financial&#13;
statements of Bank-financed components will be prepared and audited in accordance with&#13;
International Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Audits will also be carried out, at the same time, and for corresponding periods, in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are&#13;
due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference will be made in the audit&#13;
reports accompanying the financial statements. Auditing of urban transport companies' accounts&#13;
will pay particular attention to cost recovery ratios. Auditors acceptable to the Bank will be&#13;
retained by MOF to review the accounting systems and supporting internal procedures and&#13;
practices for the special and loan-related accounts and SOEs, and recommend any needed&#13;
changes which would be implemented after Bank agreement not later than six months after loan&#13;
effectiveness (this arrangement would allow for three months' operation of the accounts).&#13;
5.57      Semi-annual progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by&#13;
the project cities and MOT, and sent to the Bank within one month after the end of each six&#13;
month period. These reports will include: (a) progress achieved against agreed implementation&#13;
and disbursement schedules, including number of contracts for goods and vehicle rehabilitation&#13;
works awarded, number of buses and quantity of spare parts delivered, number of urban&#13;
transport vehicles rehabilitated, and project monitorable targets and performance indicators, and&#13;
(b) work programs and cost estimates for the coming six months and for the total project. The&#13;
main purpose of the reports will be to provide managers timely and updated information on&#13;
implementation of project components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending&#13;
actions and commenting on progress in resolving previous recommendations. Upon completion&#13;
of the project, MOT and the project cities will also prepare an evaluation report on the project's&#13;
execution.&#13;
5.58      One of the tasks of the PA is to assist with the supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
project. The PA will be responsible for obtaining from the cities all data relating to the&#13;
implementation of the reform program (including financial statements and details of transit&#13;
operations), evaluating such data, and giving advice and assistance when necessary to the cities.&#13;
If additional assistance is required for any particular city, the PA will be able to call on the&#13;
assistance of his company to provide several staff-months of specific urban transport services.&#13;
The PA will also help direct the consultants responsible for assisting the project cities' transport&#13;
regulatory authorities and urban transport companies. The data and evaluation provided by the&#13;
PA will be used by Bank supervision missions to evaluate the implementation of the reform&#13;
program and progress on all areas of urban transit operations. As well as the PLW, there will&#13;
be two supervision missions in FY96, three supervision missions in FY97, two in FY98, and&#13;
one in FY99: each mission will be for about three to four weeks. Most missions would be&#13;
staffed by an urban transport specialist and an economist/financial analyst, plus other specialists&#13;
such as an institutional analyst, procurement expert, vehicle maintenance specialist, training&#13;
expert, or transport industry specialist. Missions would review the physical components of the&#13;
project and implementation of reform programs including all the institutional and policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                       65&#13;
development measures proposed under the project and agree on remedial measures. The mission&#13;
reviews would be done in the context of agreed targets. Each city could be visited twice a year&#13;
with a different staff specialist each time. Supervision between missions will be assisted by the&#13;
infrastructure specialist in the Bank's Resident Mission. Details of the supervision plan are given&#13;
in Annex 5.15.&#13;
5.59      During the mid-term review and annual project review (para 5.35), evidence of&#13;
progress with implementation of the agreed reform program would be provided by the project&#13;
cities. Part of the TOR of the consultants providing technical assistance to the project cities will&#13;
be to assist the project companies with the collection of relevant urban transport data and&#13;
progress with implementation of the reform program. The forwarding of such information by&#13;
the project cities to the PID on a quarterly basis will be a condition of the onlending agreement.&#13;
J. ENvIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.60      The Bank determined that the project requires a "category B" rating, as defined in&#13;
the Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), since it is not&#13;
expected to have any significant negative environmental impact. Background information as well&#13;
as technical details of the project's environmental assessment are presented in Annex 5.16.&#13;
5.61      Crucial environmental issues that are related to the transportation sector in general&#13;
and are not urban public transport specific (such as institutional and legal framework for&#13;
environmental standards enforcement at federal, regional and local level of government in&#13;
Russia, system of economic incentives for environmentally sound transport operations) are not&#13;
within the scope of the project, since these issues are specifically addressed in two other Bank&#13;
projects in Russia. The Environmental Management Project ([Ln. 3806-RU] US$110 million)&#13;
focuses on the improvement of overall institutional and regulatory framework of environmental&#13;
management throughout various sectors of economy and levels of government. The Highway&#13;
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project ([Ln. 3706-RU] US$300 million) has a US$5 million&#13;
component designed to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport of the Russian&#13;
Federation in improving legal and organizational framework of the nation's transport sector in&#13;
the face of economic transition and environmental constraints. To this end, the environmental&#13;
assessment of the Urban Transport Project is building upon and complementing the&#13;
aforementioned efforts and only touches upon a limited number of transportation sector areas&#13;
of environmental concern, namely automotive air pollution and solid and liquid waste disposal&#13;
by transit companies.&#13;
5.62      Automotive Urban Air Pollution. The new diesel-powered buses to be financed under&#13;
the project will have engines that shall be certified in conformance with one of the following&#13;
emissions standards for heavy-duty engines: UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE),&#13;
EURO-1, and will be less polluting than the gasoline-powered buses in operation today.&#13;
Moreover, starting from 1994 all models of motor vehicles manufactured and imported in the&#13;
Russian Federation are subject to environmental certification in direct accordance with the UN&#13;
ECE Regulations No. 82, 24, 40, 47, 49, and 15 (these new rules have been introduced in&#13;
March 31, 1993 by the Ordinance of the RF State Committee for Standards).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                                                                         Chapter V&#13;
5.63      Replacement of the bus fleet and changes in its composition would not have a major&#13;
effect on the overall average level of atmospheric pollution in the 14 project cities. For example,&#13;
Omsk, Yekaterinburg, and Samara are included in the Government's list of 43 Russian cities that&#13;
experiences critically high level of air pollution generated predominantly by stationary sources&#13;
(heavy industry). Moreover, according to Russia's nationwide estimates, buses in 1992 accounted&#13;
for only 7.2 percent of transport emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and 10.8 percent of nitrous&#13;
dioxide (NO2), the bulk of these pollutants being generated by trucks (up to 88 percent). A more&#13;
important effect of the project would be manifested through significant reductions in carbon&#13;
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions (23.8 percent of transport's total) and lower&#13;
peak concentrations of these pollutants in traffic congested urban areas, which now account for&#13;
up to 50 percent of the carbon emissions in the project cities (especially smaller ones) and some&#13;
80-90 percent of the total atmospheric pollution by buses. Current composition of atmospheric&#13;
pollution generated by urban transport companies in the project cities is shown in Annex 5.16,&#13;
Table 1, with Novgorod being different from a typical situation for its 100 percent diesel-&#13;
engined fleet of Ikarus buses. Implications of reductions in the S02 emissions can be assessed&#13;
through the NIIAT analysis of the sulfur content and other characteristics of diesel fuels supplied&#13;
to the project cities by several oil refineries in Russia (sulfur content ranging from 0.01 percent&#13;
in Nizhniy Novgorod to 0.6 percent in Velikie Luki, and resin content from 10 to 40&#13;
mg/lOOcm3, with a tendency to increase for winter brands of fuel as opposed to summer ones).&#13;
Gharacteristics of these fuels (Annex 5.16, Table 3) will be accounted for in technical&#13;
specifications for diesel engines for the buses to be procured under the project. Suppliers will&#13;
be requested to furnish recommendations for proper maintenance of the engine when operating&#13;
on diesel fuels available in Russia, so that engine performance and durability are not reduced.&#13;
5.64      Since transport air pollution statistics at the local (city, enterprise) levels in Russia&#13;
are heavily based on fuel consumption figures and more direct measurement techniques are not&#13;
yet adequately available, fuel economy data from transport companies will be used as an easily&#13;
monitorable environmental performance indicator throughout the project implementation period,&#13;
which would enable to assess reductions in total emissions of specific substances to be assessed&#13;
(provided the vehicle model-specific exhaust characteristics and fuel composition are known&#13;
variables). Taking into account that a generic new bus in Russia typically consumes 10 to 15&#13;
percent less fuel (gasoline or diesel) per 100 km than an eight year-old bus of the same make&#13;
and model, and that urban buses with diesel engines consume 16-18 percent less fuel that the&#13;
ones with gasoline engines, Bank-financed buses will be considerably more fuel efficient than&#13;
the present fleet of buses in Russia, providing an estimated economy of 680 tons of fuel per year&#13;
for a typically-sized city like Kostroma (281,000 residents, 187 city route buses), or as much&#13;
as 20,000-30,000 tons of fuel per year for all 14 candidate project cities.&#13;
5.65      Noise Reduction and Waste Disposal. Urban transport is known to be the major&#13;
source of audible noise in all cities, independent of their size. Motor vehicles not only account&#13;
for 80 percent of all zones of acoustic discomfort in cities (an average of 30 percent of Russia's&#13;
urban population lives in such zones of acoustic discomfort), but also cause peak supernormative&#13;
levels of noise in residential areas (5-35 dBA above normative). New transit vehicles would also&#13;
be less noisy (maximum external noise should not exceed 86 dBA as measured 15 meters from&#13;
the vehicle). In addition, the rehabilitation and spare parts for repairs to be financed under the&#13;
project will help improve vehicle maintenance, which will lead to reduced levels of noise of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                          67&#13;
operating vehicles (including, in particularly, trolleybuses and trams). Another sizeable by-&#13;
product of urban transport operations is the accumulation of recyclable (ferrous and non-ferrous&#13;
metals) and non-recyclable wastes (rubber, petroleum products, oil, paint, etc.). To support&#13;
and/or enhance remedial activities towards this end, assistance would be provided to the project&#13;
transit companies to suggest methods of limiting harmful effects of the disposal of non-recyclable&#13;
engine fluids and old tires (as a routine garage maintenance component of the vehicle&#13;
rehabilitation technical assistance program, Annex 5.5).&#13;
5.66       Yet another likely impact of the project that benefits the urban environment and&#13;
health of the cities is expected to be caused by a decrease in the peak-hour overcrowding of&#13;
transit vehicles (currently up to 14 passengers per m2). This overcrowding, according to city&#13;
officials, is one of the significant factors spreading respiratory diseases among the daily&#13;
commuting working population and high rate of sick leave during the cold seasons. Such an&#13;
impact, though, cannot be easily quantified because of the lack of reliable medical statistics.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF PROJECT CITIES&#13;
AND THEIR URBAN TRANSPORT COMPANIES&#13;
6.1       The project will provide urban transport companies in the project cities with 2,154&#13;
new buses (of which the Bank will finance 1,501) and 509 trolleybuses (of which the Bank will&#13;
finance 272), spare parts to repair 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses, and 380 trams as well as&#13;
technical assistance, workshop and computer equipment and a fare collection system for&#13;
Vologda.&#13;
6.2       Because urban transport companies' revenues are not expected to exceed operating&#13;
expenses in any of the project cities, the financial rate of return on the project's investments is&#13;
negative in every case. Cost recovery ranged from 3 percent to 52 percent in the first quarter&#13;
and from 8 percent to 65 percent in the second quarter of 1994 for the candidate cities. Although&#13;
improvement to at least 25 percent has been attained by all transit companies included in the&#13;
project, this still represents a substantial net loss for each company. Therefore, no effort was&#13;
made to try to calculate the financial rate of return for the project. Further, no attempt has been&#13;
made to assess the financial return on the national spare parts component as it is impossible to&#13;
determine a priori the end users of the spares to be purchased or whether they will be used to&#13;
rehabilitate out-of-service buses or to keep vehicles operational on a daily basis. Instead,&#13;
financial evaluation of the project has focused on three main issues:&#13;
-    Financial Evaluation of the Urban Transport Companies to assess the present&#13;
and projected financial performance of the project cities' urban transport companies&#13;
with a view toward assessing the need for, and ability to implement, tariff increases,&#13;
reductions in exemptions and other actions central to the attainment of the project's&#13;
cost recovery targets;&#13;
*    Financial Evaluation of the Municipal Budgets in the Project Cities to ascertain&#13;
the degree to which these budgets are currently subsidizing transport losses and the&#13;
likelihood that city budgets can realistically absorb repayment of a Bank loan for the&#13;
purchase of new urban transport vehicles and related investments included in the&#13;
project; and&#13;
*    Relationship of Fares to the Incomes of Urban Transport Passengers to assess&#13;
the current affordability of fares for urban transport passengers and estimate the&#13;
scope for increasing the urban transport share of an average wage earner's salary&#13;
or average household's budget expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                                                          Chapter VI&#13;
A. URBAN TRANSPORT COMPANIES IN THE PROJECT CITIES&#13;
6.3       Financial evaluation was carried out using financial statements for each urban&#13;
transport company for 1992, 1993, and the first quarter of 1994 and then forecasting revenues&#13;
and expenses for each company based on the stated intentions of each candidate city to&#13;
implement real increases in fares, projected passenger demand and operating practices. The&#13;
projections were based on constant first quarter 1994 ruble prices. Actual and projected cost&#13;
recovery ratios were calculated for each urban transport company for the 1992-1994 period.&#13;
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken with respect to assumptions regarding fuel prices, tariff&#13;
increases, timing of tariff increases compared to inflation, and the degree to which city&#13;
governments and operating companies are able to rescind legally mandated fare exemptions.&#13;
Subsequently, candidate cities provided financial data for the second quarter 1994 but these data&#13;
were used only to determine compliance with cost recovery. Specific assumptions used in the&#13;
analysis and a summary of the results are discussed below. The data discussed here are contained&#13;
in the Project File.&#13;
6.4       Revenues. The companies' future revenues were based on existing demand figures,&#13;
except where a case for significant changes could be made, and fare levels based on each city's&#13;
intention to increase fares. The political climate for raising real fares and improving cost&#13;
recovery will be far greater with the project since service levels will be improved in many cases&#13;
and maintained in other.&#13;
6.5       Expenses. On the cost side, the companies' future costs were based on existing costs&#13;
adjusted for projected average vehicle operating costs for newer, more reliable, buses purchased&#13;
through the project. Fuel costs, for example, should be lower since new buses and rehabilitated&#13;
buses put back in service with new engines and transmissions will be significantly more fuel-&#13;
efficient than the old buses. Other cost savings will result from savings in spare part usage and&#13;
labor costs for maintenance as a newer fleet should have fewer breakdowns and better&#13;
performance than the existing fleet. On the other hand, total costs may increase as the number&#13;
of vehicles operated increases; in some instances, operational expansion may necessitate the&#13;
hiring of additional drivers and/or mechanics to service additions to the fleet.&#13;
6.6       Results - Cost Recovery. The forecasted operating results are contained in the Project&#13;
File together with greater details about the assumptions used in each project city. In every case,&#13;
as expected, the cities project financial losses to continue. The exercise was undertaken,&#13;
however, to help cities appreciate the need to increase tariffs and to consider the relationship&#13;
between the timing of cost increases and tariff increases. Since doing so, cities have come to&#13;
better understand the need to track and improve cost recovery ratios and have made concentrated&#13;
efforts to reverse the decline from 1992 to 1993. Table 6.1 shows the cost recovery ratios for&#13;
1992, 1993, the first two quarters of 1994, and the month of January 1995. These results should&#13;
be c6mpared against the targets for cost recovery as agreed in the reform program, including&#13;
at least 20 percent by first quarter 1994 and 25 percent by negotiations. As shown therein,&#13;
except for Omsk's tram company (which was excluded from the project), the transit companies&#13;
in fourteen cities achieved a cost recovery of at least 25 percent by July 1994. The cost recovery&#13;
target of 40 percent set for March 31, 1996 in the reform program has reportedly been met by&#13;
nine of the cities for bus operations. Even the target of 50 percent cost recovery set for the end&#13;
&#13;

undertaken to achieve 40 percent cost recovery for the six months prior to signing of the contract&#13;
for buses and trolleybuses. Those cities that do not achieve this ratio will only receive buses to&#13;
meet 1995 and 1996 needs: the procurement of buses to meet 1997 needs will be delayed until&#13;
the 40 percent cost recovery target included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (March 31, 1996)&#13;
has been met.&#13;
B. SENs1Tvr ANALYSES OF URBAN TRANSPORT COMPANY FINANCIAL FORECASTS&#13;
6.7        Tariff Increases. Sensitivity analysis of the projections indicates that the most&#13;
significant factor in achieving the revenue targets is the timeliness of the rate increases needed&#13;
to cover cost increases due to inflation. In an inflationary environment of 15 percent per month,&#13;
a lag of one month can reduce cost recovery ratios significantly. Using 1993 figures, a lag of&#13;
one month would have reduced the average cost recovery ratio from 11.8 percent to 10.3&#13;
percent; a two month lag would have reduced cost recovery in 1993 to 9.2 percent and a three&#13;
month lag at 15 percent per month inflation would have reduced the average cost recovery ratio&#13;
for 1993 to 7.9 percent on an annual basis. Any real improvement of cost recovery requires a&#13;
real increase in fares. Experience to date shows that increases have significantly lagged behind&#13;
cost increases until cities made concerted efforts to reverse the situation in order to quality for&#13;
the project (Figure 6.1). Even so, even where cities have good intentions to raise fares in real&#13;
terms very few have managed to do it. Thus, it is important that the project benefits be used to&#13;
induce the cities to improve cost recovery to the greatest extent possible. To this end, only those&#13;
cities that met the 25 percent cost recovery criteria by end-July 1994 were included in the&#13;
project.&#13;

6.8       Fuel Price Increases. Analysis shows that the projects are also sensitive to real&#13;
increases in fuel prices. The average cost recovery ratio of 12.9 percent in 1993 would have&#13;
been reduced to 9.7 percent if fuel prices had been at world price levels in 1993 (roughly three&#13;
times higher than recorded).&#13;
6.9        Reduction of exemptions is also critical to improving cost recovery. If the cities do&#13;
not want to increase real fares as much as necessary, they can improve cost recovery by&#13;
increasing the number of paying customers. If exemptions were cut to only 10 percent of riders,&#13;
the average cost recovery would improve significantly. For example, in Rostov cost recovery&#13;
in the fourth quarter of 1993 was seven percent but if the company had been reimbursed for&#13;
exemptions, the cost recovery ratio would have been 15 percent. Where exemptions currently&#13;
are being reimbursed explicitly, rather than implicitly through general subsidy payments, the&#13;
reimbursements should be considered as revenues and taken into account for purposes of cost&#13;
recovery calculation.&#13;
C. MuNICIPAL BUDGETS AND ABILITY TO REPAY LOAN&#13;
6.10      Since the project companies currently operate at a loss and are likely to continue to&#13;
operate at a loss throughout the life of the loan, it is not possible for these companies to repay&#13;
either the interest or the principal on any Bank loan aimed at purchasing new vehicles and spare&#13;
parts. Responsibility for repaying the loan lies with the city governments that own the project&#13;
companies and have contracted for their services. The ability of the cities to make available more&#13;
funds from their budgets if urban transport companies improved cost recovery was discussed in&#13;
Chapter III (paras 3.53-3.65). In the financial evaluation of the project, an analysis was also&#13;
made of the percent of each cities' budget expenses that would be represented by having to&#13;
service the debt of the World Bank loan at the agreed lending rate. The calculation was made&#13;
by determining the level of annuity needed to repay a loan equal to the amount of investment&#13;
in new vehicles, spare parts for rehabilitation and workshop equipment at 9.09 percent interest&#13;
on a 15 year loan with a five year grace period for principal repayments. The result for the&#13;
expected project cities is shown in Table 6.2. The annuity, as expressed as a percent of the&#13;
municipal budgets averages 3.0 percent and ranges from 1.0 percent in Nizhniy Novgorod to 7.2&#13;
percent for Saransk. Combining this debt service with subsidies paid for urban transport would&#13;
significantly raise the percentage of each city's municipal budget devoted to transport. As shown&#13;
in the last column of Table 6.2, unless subsidies are reduced by improvements in cost recovery,&#13;
total transport expenses would be from 11.4 percent to 22.1 percent of a project city's budget.&#13;
There is no way to determine what percentage of any city's budget should be devoted to the&#13;
support of urban transport. Given other pressures on city budgets, however, it is not&#13;
recommended to endorse the extension of a loan to any city if the result would represent a claim&#13;
of more than 10 percent on a city's budget. Further, it is recommended that the percent of&#13;
municipal budget spent on transport operating losses and transport capital investment combined&#13;
be kept no higher than 15-20 percent. Cost recovery improvement, therefore, is clearly essential&#13;
to the viability of these cities.&#13;
6.11      Representatives from MOF, as well as MOT and the cities themselves, were briefed&#13;
on this analysis during the appraisal mission. In some cases, cities reacted by lowering to a&#13;
minimum the number of buses to be financed under the project. Perhaps this analysis enabled&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT RISKS&#13;
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
7.1 !     General. The poor financial situation of the urban transport companies has resulted&#13;
in a deterioration in the level of service, meaning increased waiting times and overcrowding for&#13;
passengers. Without the project, the shortage of public transport capacity and resulting lower&#13;
level of service will worsen in the cities, resulting in longer waiting times, often in sub-zero&#13;
temperatures. The breakdown rate (number of vehicles breaking down once they have left the&#13;
depot) of more than ten percent in six cities means that waiting times can be more than 30&#13;
minutes during the peak hour. To avoid waiting, passengers board already overcrowded buses&#13;
with consequent excessive loads (reportedly up to 14 per square meter passengers in&#13;
Cherepovets). With the new buses and spare parts to be financed under the project that will&#13;
enable out-of-service vehicles to be brought back into service, fleet capacity can be increased&#13;
so as to reduce overloading and waiting times.&#13;
7.2        Traffic. Unfortunately, there have not been recent passenger surveys to determine&#13;
trends or make projections of the elasticity of demand for passenger transport. The economic&#13;
evaluation has therefore made the conservative assumption that the demand for bus transport in&#13;
the 14 project cities will remain constant over the life of the project. Much will depend on the&#13;
overall economic situation in the country and future economic development of each city. If there&#13;
continues to be a major restructuring of the economy, there could be substantially more&#13;
unemployment which would lead to a lower demand for urban transport. On the other hand,&#13;
increased unemployment could lead to more peak or off-peak travel as people search for work&#13;
and possibly take on two or more low paying jobs. Changes in policy that are already being&#13;
implemented in some cities could also reduce the number of passenger trips, such as reducing&#13;
the number of passengers exempted from paying fares, controlling fare evasion, and increasing&#13;
fares (in real terms). However, the poor level of service now provided by the urban transport&#13;
companies may have suppressed demand during the peak hours, especially given the extent of&#13;
overcrowded conditions and long waiting times. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is the&#13;
extent to which there will be growth in private car ownership and the resulting impact on the&#13;
demand for urban transport.&#13;
7.3       Fleet Requirements. For the purpose of the project, fleet requirements have been&#13;
based on a service level of eight passengers/square meter during the peak period, a very low&#13;
level of service by Western standards, but it would appear that service levels were never very&#13;
high in many of the project cities. Given the poor financial situation of the urban transport&#13;
companies and the increasing pressure on municipal government budgets, the acquisition of&#13;
transport vehicles should be kept to a minimum over the next few years, especially given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                                                        Chapter VII&#13;
vehicles' high capital cost. If demand is lower than projected, then the urban transport&#13;
companies will be able to offer a higher level of service than the present minimum standard of&#13;
eight passengers/sq.m. although they would be unlikely to attain the generally accepted western&#13;
industry standard of service of five passengers/sq.m. However, in some cities, the municipal&#13;
government has decided to provide a higher level of service (six to seven passengers/sq.m.) and&#13;
are financing the additional vehicles out of local funds.&#13;
7.4       As of 1993, the fourteen project cities had a combined fleet of 6,329 buses, 1,389&#13;
trolleybuses and 1,505 trams with an average age of six to seven years for buses in most cities,&#13;
five to seven years for trolleybuses, and five to ten years for trams. On average, the Russian-&#13;
made medium bus has a maximum life of eight years while the Hungarian Ikarus 200 series large&#13;
and articulated buses have a life of eight to ten years. The short life of the buses is due to lack&#13;
of corrosion prevention which results in the buses quickly rusting away. Fleet size has been&#13;
diminishing over the last five years and the fleet has been ageing because of the failure to&#13;
replace vehicles beyond their economic life. Over the life of the project, about 53 percent of the&#13;
bus fleets should be written off because they will be beyond their economic life. As well as new&#13;
vehicles, the project will also finance rehabilitation of buses, trolleybuses and trams based on&#13;
the criteria established in Annex 5.2. Details of the project cities' fleets and vehicles to be&#13;
financed under the project are given in Annex 7.1.&#13;
7.5       Economic Analysis. The economic analysis of the project has been carried out in the&#13;
absence of a transport plan for each city which was one reason for focussing only on&#13;
replacement needs and not expansion of the bus, trolleybus or tram systems. Such plans will be&#13;
carried out as part of the technical assistance to be provided under the project. The economic&#13;
analysis is based on very approximate data, not only because there were no detailed passenger&#13;
surveys available, but also due to the lack of vehicle maintenance cost and other data.&#13;
7.6       An increasing burden has been put on urban transport companies as their vehicles&#13;
have reached the end of their economic life and not been replaced. The ageing fleet, plus lack&#13;
of funds for vehicle maintenance and unavailability of spare parts for Russian-manufactured&#13;
vehicles has led to declining availability rates for buses, trolleybuses and trams. The result has&#13;
been a deterioration in service levels with increasing waiting times and excessive overcrowding.&#13;
In the economic analysis, the without project case has assumed that the low level of expenditures&#13;
on vehicles would continue for the first few years of the project, and that from 1995 to 1998 the&#13;
cities would only be able to replace about forty to fifty percent of their vehicles as they reached&#13;
the end of their economic life (however, they would not be able to catch up with the backlog of&#13;
replacement needs in 1993). Consequently, the size of the existing fleet would continue to&#13;
decrease, with the result that waiting times and overcrowding would continue to increase&#13;
(although in some cities they have reached the maximum capacity on many routes so that any&#13;
further decline in service levels would have the most impact on passenger waiting time). After&#13;
1998, it was assumed that cities would be in a better financial position, following generally&#13;
improved economic conditions in Russia, to replace their fleet and increase expenditure on&#13;
maintenance until all replacement and maintenance needs were met.&#13;
7.7        The economic analysis assumed that with the project, new buses and trolleybuses&#13;
and rehabilitation of buses, trolleybuses and trams financed under the project would result in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VII                                                                      79&#13;
greatly improved service levels. Fleet size could be reduced in some cases because of the lower&#13;
reserve capacity required for the new vehicles compared to the old and lower quality fleet of&#13;
existing vehicles. Buses, trolleybuses and trams would be rehabilitated approximately halfway&#13;
through their normal working life and once they had been rehabilitated their effective utilization&#13;
would increase substantially. The economic evaluation compared the capital cost of the new&#13;
vehicles and rehabilitation, plus the extra operating and maintenance costs of the new and&#13;
rehabilitated buses, with the benefits resulting from passenger time savings following the more&#13;
frequent service. Without the project, maintenance and operating costs would be lower for the&#13;
present fleet because of the lower vehicle kilometrage, low vehicle availability, and current&#13;
practice of cannibalizing old vehicles for spare parts and making spare parts in the workshops&#13;
(often leading to higher breakdown rates) because of the lack of funds for spare parts.&#13;
7.8        The ERR for new buses varies from 14 percent in Yekaterinburg to 36 percent in&#13;
Tver, and for the total bus component, including rehabilitation, from 20 percent in&#13;
Yekaterinburg to 58 percent in Cherepovets. New trolleybuses are estimated to have an ERR of&#13;
14 percent in Saransk to 36 percent in Yekaterinburg, and the total trolleybus component,&#13;
including rehabilitation, ranges from 23 percent to 75 percent. Rehabilitation only for&#13;
trolleybuses and for trams has an ERR of over 100 percent. The ERR for all new vehicles and&#13;
rehabilitation for the 14 project cities was 39 percent. To test the sensitivity of the economic&#13;
analysis, ERRs were estimated using different assumptions about waiting time, and value of time&#13;
for each city; a 20 percent decrease in either one would result in ERRs ranging from 13-26&#13;
percent for buses and 10-26 percent for trolleybuses. The ERR for all the cities would be about&#13;
16 percent. For some cities, the results are quite sensitive to changes in key variables; therefore&#13;
the economic evaluation has assumed quite conservative values for most of the key variables in&#13;
the base case. The lowest estimate of waiting times has been taken plus a conservative estimate&#13;
of the value of time. The latter is obviously more difficult to determine, especially in times of&#13;
economic adjustment and sharply falling exchange rates. The sensitivity of the ERR to changes&#13;
in key variables demonstrates the importance of improving the quality of data collection,&#13;
especially regarding the number of passengers, waiting time, and maintenance costs.&#13;
7.9       It was found that the rate of return varied significantly depending upon the number&#13;
of additional buses purchased. The marginal return on additional buses fell steadily as more&#13;
buses were purchased. This is because the proportionate savings in waiting time from adding an&#13;
additional vehicle to the fleet becomes less as more vehicles are purchased. Not surprisingly,&#13;
the estimated ERRs are generally highest for those cities where the observed waiting time is&#13;
highest. In a number of those cities in 1993 the estimated peak hour average waiting time was&#13;
15 minutes which would in some cases, increase to 20 to 30 minutes by 1998. With the project,&#13;
the average peak hour waiting times for these cities in 1998 was estimated to decline 10 to 15&#13;
minutes (so as to reduce the size of the Bank loan, a few cities have elected not to have Bank&#13;
financing for all their fleet replacement with the result that waiting times will not decrease as&#13;
much as for other cities which use Bank financing to meet all their replacement needs during the&#13;
project period). Waiting times could be even higher were it not for the cold climate, since&#13;
passengers struggle to board buses rather than wait in sub-zero weather conditions. Because of&#13;
the problem with quantifying benefits, the economic evaluation does not include the benefits&#13;
from reducing the present severe overcrowding of buses, although this is a major benefit of the&#13;

80                                                                        Chapter VII&#13;
project. Assumptions used in the economic analysis and the ERRs for individual cities are&#13;
included in Annex 7.1.&#13;
7.10      The project also includes a national component for spare parts to be distributed to&#13;
bus, trolleybus and tram companies throughout Russia. The spare parts will help put back&#13;
serviceable transport vehicles into operation that would otherwise be left idle because project&#13;
companies will not have sufficient funds to purchase spare parts or because spares are not locally&#13;
available. Given that the project companies which are going to purchase the spares will not be&#13;
known until project implementation, it is difficult to estimate an ERR for the component.&#13;
However, an indication of the ERR for this component has been obtained by evaluating the&#13;
economic benefits of rehabilitation of vehicles, estimated at over 100 percent.&#13;
7.11      Other benefits that have not been quantified include important organizational reforms&#13;
that will be carried out, including: (i) establishment of autonomous urban transport agencies&#13;
completely separate from the oblast or municipal governments; (ii) municipal governments and&#13;
urban transport companies entering into contracts to set performance targets and encourage&#13;
greater efficiency for the provision of transport services; (iii) municipalities establishing transport&#13;
departments to regulate transport services; (iv) the introduction of private transport services, and&#13;
(v) divestiture of non-urban transport services and taxi services from municipal ownership. These&#13;
improvements are expected to contribute significantly to reducing the cost of passenger transport&#13;
in the project cities, although such costs are difficult to quantify and therefore cannot be included&#13;
in the estimate of the economic rate of return of the project.&#13;
B. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
7.12      A major risk of the project is that the proposed reforms, especially the cost recovery&#13;
reforms, will not be implemented as promised. If these reforms are not implemented, the new&#13;
buses and spare parts financed under the loan would only give temporary relief. Availability&#13;
rates of vehicles would once again decline because of the lack of spare parts and fleet&#13;
replacement, and vehicle maintenance costs would increase because of the ageing fleet.&#13;
Therefore, the project included cost recovery (25 percent by negotiations) and organizational&#13;
reform conditionality as a pre-requisite for cities to be included in the project, and further cost&#13;
recovery (40 percent) and organizational reforms to be carried out by the cities by March of&#13;
1996. However, during negotiations most cities reported that they had already met the 40 percent&#13;
cost recovery target and that all intended to meet the target for the remainder of 1995. Once the&#13;
companies receive the new buses and trolleybuses they should be able to increase cost recovery&#13;
even more with the substantially improved level of service. The success of the project cities with&#13;
improving cost recovery has demonstrated to other cities in Russia that it is possible to undertake&#13;
such reforms and lessen the heavy burden of urban transport subsidies and there is evidence that&#13;
other cities want to follow the example of the project cites. Given the enormous adjustments&#13;
required to go from a centrally planned economy which gave little consideration to cost recovery&#13;
to a market economy involving the commercialization of public sector enterprises, even if only&#13;
two thirds of the cities maintain the objectives of the reform program the project should still be&#13;
regarded as a success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VII                                                                       81&#13;
7.13       Another risk is that once the project is completed the urban transport companies will&#13;
still not have sufficient funds for the purchase of spare parts and replacement of the fleet, even&#13;
with improved cost recovery achieved under the project. Project companies will have to compete&#13;
with other priority sectors to secure adequate subsidies from local government which could come&#13;
under increasing financial pressure over the next few years. Given the uncertainty over future&#13;
levels of funding, the project will: (a) set a target of 50 percent cost recovery by the end of the&#13;
project, (b) require the introduction of contracts between the municipal government and project&#13;
companies guaranteeing payment of subsidies based on performance standards; and (c) introduce&#13;
privatization of urban transport services to reduce public funding requirements. Despite these&#13;
resources, there is still a risk of under-funding by municipal governments making it even more&#13;
urgent for the cities to continue to improve cost recovery and reduce reliance on the local&#13;
government for subsidies once the project is completed.&#13;
7.14       A third risk is that there will be delays in project execution. To reduce this risk,&#13;
bidding documents for the major components of the project already have been prepared and&#13;
substantially agreed. The Government wishes to go out to bid for the buses and trolleybuses as&#13;
soon as possible, so as to have the contracts ready to award right after loan effectiveness.&#13;
7.15       A fourth risk is that cities will not purchase the spare parts to be financed under the&#13;
national spare parts component since the parts are to be sold at their purchase price plus mark-&#13;
up. MOT will onlend to the distribution center, thereby encouraging the center to keep its costs&#13;
to a minimum. The center will have one year to repay MOT after delivery of the spare parts and&#13;
will auction off any remaining parts at the end of the year. The procurement of the spare parts&#13;
will be divided into two packages of US$25 million, and the second procurement will not start&#13;
until MOF has been reimbursed by the distribution company for the spare parts purchased under&#13;
the first procurement.&#13;
7.16       A final risk is that the investment components, especially the new vehicles, could&#13;
cost more than originally estimated. However, there have been two recent bids for buses&#13;
financed by the Bank upon which to base the cost estimates. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government also agreed that the second procurement of the national spare parts would be&#13;
delayed until the contracts for the new vehicles had been signed and it is evident that there are&#13;
sufficient funds for the vehicles in the project. If not, the Government would have to assess the&#13;
relative priority of new vehicles against the national spare parts component and possibly request&#13;
reallocation of funds from the national spare parts component for the higher than estimated cost&#13;
of the new vehicles.&#13;

Subsidiary Loan Agreements&#13;
8.3       The Government agreed to include the following conditions in the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements with the project cities:&#13;
e    The project city will inform the Bank about any investment project for its transport&#13;
system which significantly affects the municipality's financial situation and will&#13;
inform the Bank about the results of feasibility studies in order to enable the Bank&#13;
to provide its opinion regarding the project (para 3.40).&#13;
*    The project city will cause the participating transport companies to achieve, by&#13;
December 1, 1995, a minimum 35 percent cost recovery for the previous six months&#13;
and by March 31, 1996, a 40 percent cost recovery for the previous six months&#13;
(para 3.42).&#13;
*    By December 31, 1995, the project city will complete the separation of city bus&#13;
operations from inter-city bus operations (para 3.42).&#13;
*    By June 1, 1996, the project city will adopt action plans, agreed with the Bank, to&#13;
introduce contractual arrangements aiming at improving operating efficiencies of&#13;
transport companies, reducing their costs and the overall level of subsidies provided&#13;
to them by local governments (para 3.42).&#13;
*    By June 30, 1997, the project city will have completed an analysis of the least-cost&#13;
mode of urban transport (para 3.42).&#13;
*    The project city will take measures to support the provision of transport services by&#13;
private individuals or companies, to encourage wider provision of urban transport&#13;
services (para 3.42).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VIII                                                                    85&#13;
*    By September 1, 1996, the project city will prepare plans for contracts with entities&#13;
other than the project companies to provide urban transport services or auxiliary&#13;
services (para 3.42).&#13;
*    An onlending rate for each subloan to the 14 project cities of 200 basis points above&#13;
the Bank lending rate. The subloans are to be repaid to MOF over a period of 15&#13;
years inclusive of a five years' grace period. The foreign exchange risk is to be&#13;
borne by the project cities (para 5.32).&#13;
The project monitorable targets (Annex 5.12) will also be included in each of the project cities'&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the Government, including the target to reduce fare evasion&#13;
to ten percent of passengers by June 1996 and to seven percent by June 1998 (para 3.42).&#13;
8.4       The Government agreed to include the following conditions in the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement with Avtosnabsbyt:&#13;
*    An onlending rate for the subloan to Avtosnabsbyt of 250 basis points above the&#13;
Bank lending rate with a one year loan maturity, and foreign exchange risk to be&#13;
borne by Avtosnabsbyt (para 5.33).&#13;
*    There will be two bidding packages of up to US$25 million each. No bids for the&#13;
second procurement of spare parts under the national spare parts program shall be&#13;
invited until the proceeds advanced to Avtosnabsbyt for the first procurement have&#13;
been fully repaid to MOF (para 5.44).&#13;
X    Avtosnabsbyt charges prices based on commercial prices for the spare parts (para&#13;
5.44).&#13;
8.5       The Bank has formally acknowledged Declarations of Commitment signed by each&#13;
city detailing the numbers of vehicles to be purchased under the project, vehicles to be&#13;
rehabilitated and other components and the reform program to be implemented by each city. The&#13;
requirement that urban transport entities attain a 25 percent cost recovery by negotiations has&#13;
been fulfilled by the entities included in the project (para 6.6). Each participating city's oblast&#13;
government has agreed to guarantee the subsidiary loan (para 5.32). Conditions of loan&#13;
effectiveness are (i) that the PID have signed a contract with a firm or firms to provide project&#13;
management and procurement services (para 5.30); and (ii) signing of the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements by at least five project city governments (para 5.33).&#13;
8.6       Subject to agreement on the above, the Urban Transport Project is suitable for a loan&#13;
of US$329 million equivalent to the Russian Federation at the standard variable interest rate, for&#13;
a term of 17 years including a grace period of five years.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5.3&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
SERVICES TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF&#13;
THE TRANSIT EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY&#13;
BACKGROuND&#13;
1.          Because of the globalization of the automotive manufacturing industry, the pace&#13;
of investment in that industry has increased over the past few years. The entry of the countries&#13;
of the former Soviet Union into the world economy will provide additional markets and&#13;
manufacturing facilities to the world's pool of supply and demand for such products. This is&#13;
particularly important in the case of equipment for urban passenger transport - including buses,&#13;
articulated buses, trolleybuses, and trams - for which Russia has a large market and a&#13;
substantial potential for production.&#13;
2.          Global. The location of automotive manufacturing is truly worldwide, ranging&#13;
from North America and Westem Europe to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, East and South&#13;
Asia, and Latin America. But even as investment in the industry has been rising, the industry&#13;
has been going through major changes because of disequilibrium between supply and demand,&#13;
revised government policies, expanding international trade, and - more recently - growth in&#13;
transplant production. Companies are thus rethinking their strategies; entering into mergers and&#13;
alliances that are altering the structure of the industry and the relationships between vehicle&#13;
manufacturers and their suppliers; developing new approaches to the location of production and&#13;
marketing; accelerating the development and application of new technologies; and bringing about&#13;
a host of other changes affecting both the process and the product. In this environment,&#13;
governments have been modifying their policies, although not necessarily uniformly with one&#13;
another, while some of the emerging producing countries in the global market - such as&#13;
Mexico, Brazil and Taiwan - have moved toward liberalization. Environmental concerns related&#13;
to road vehicles are on the rise and many more governments are likely to establish relevant&#13;
regulations.&#13;
3.          In short, whereas the interest in investing in the transit equipment manufacturing&#13;
sector and in joining the global market is very high, such investments carry a substantial amount&#13;
of risk unless they are first carefully assessed and then properly structured.&#13;
4.          Russia. The Russian Government's interest in this sector stems from its lack of&#13;
a well-developed and competitive domestic industry for the manufacturing of buses, trolleybuses,&#13;
and trams. Given Russia's huge domestic market for such equipment and its fiscal interest in&#13;
avoiding the accumulation of large international debts, importing large numbers of urban transit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100                                                                      Annex 5.3&#13;
vehicles is not in Russia's long-term interest. Russia's need for action is driven by the impact&#13;
of the break-up of the former Soviet Union and the dissolution of COMECON on Russia's&#13;
traditional sources of supply for urban transit equipment.&#13;
5.          The vast majority of urban transport buses were manufactured in Hungary by&#13;
Ikarus while buses assigned to suburban routes were manufactured for the most part by Ikarus&#13;
and the Lvov Bus Plant in Ukraine. Of the 84,380 buses manufactured in the USSR in 1990, a&#13;
6.9 percent decrease from the 90,618 produced in 1989, the Lvov plant, which specializes in&#13;
medium-size intercity and local or rural route buses, accounted for 14.5 percent of overall&#13;
production. The Riga Bus Plant (in Latvia), specializes in a line of minibus models and&#13;
accounted for 20.3 percent of total 1990 bus production. Russian bus manufacturers include the&#13;
Likino Bus Plant (LiAZ), which manufactures large city buses (6,002 in 1990); the Pavlovo Bus&#13;
Plant (PAZ), which produces small-size buses (8,600 in 1990); and the Kurgan Plant (KAvZ),&#13;
a producer of small general purpose buses (19,360 in 1990). AvtoUAZ and KamAZ also&#13;
produce buses and accounted for 15 percent and 5.8 percent of overall bus production in 1990.&#13;
The domestic trolleybus producer is the Uritskiy Trolleybus Plant (ZIU) which produced 2,300&#13;
vehicles in 1990.&#13;
6.          Prior to the break-up of the FSU, Government intended to increase bus production&#13;
in the USSR under the auspices of the Avtrokon Concern, an association of bus and trolleybus&#13;
producers. Under this plan, three additional bus manufacturers were to be created: the&#13;
Davydovka, Golsityno and Tula bus plants. However, the introduction of reform oriented&#13;
policies and their impact has already had a marked effect on the structure of bus production.&#13;
7.          Most manufacturers of road vehicles have now been privatized or made into joint&#13;
stock companies. To introduce new technology and capitalize upgraded facilities, most of these&#13;
manufacturers are now discussing potential joint venture arrangements with various western or&#13;
Asian engine and vehicle manufacturers; however, due to the perceived uncertain business&#13;
climate itself due in part to the lack of a private sector supporting legal and financial&#13;
infrastructure, few joint ventures are in place. Nevertheless joint venture discussions are ongoing&#13;
and the situation is dynamic.&#13;
8.          The market will also change. Car ownership will increase, which will inevitably&#13;
affect traffic on some bus routes. Further, with the need to increase cost recovery it is likely the&#13;
same city bus companies will wish to cut down or shed completely service on unprofitable&#13;
routes. Some deregulation is likely to take place which eventually will give emerging private&#13;
sector operators a share of the market - probably initially in inter-city services but also some&#13;
city services. The changes will eventually have an impact on the demand for new buses but also&#13;
on the range of bus types to be manufactured to meet operators' varied requirements.&#13;
Nevertheless, even with likely market changes, given the relatively low quality of the current&#13;
fleet of 160,000 buses, the market for replacements is large. However, rather than on need,&#13;
demand will largely depend on federal and local policies towards fare setting and the consequent&#13;
rate at which the city bus companies improve their financial management. Manufacturers will&#13;
not only have to produce good buses but also develop creative financing options to assist city&#13;
bus companies to buy them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3                                                                           101&#13;
9.           Aware of the domestic and export market potential, the Government recognizes&#13;
that creating an environment that will place a premium on market-driven solutions is the best&#13;
manner in which Russia can achieve two critical goals. These are: (i) to promote the rapid and&#13;
effective development of Russia's domestic transit equipment manufacturing industry (so Russian&#13;
transit enterprises can meet their capital needs without taking on foreign currency indebtedness);&#13;
and (ii) to secure those innovations in technology necessary to improve the fuel efficiency and&#13;
emissions standards of the bulk of the urban public transport fleet'.&#13;
10.          With this in mind, Government has taken two critical steps. The first was to work&#13;
with the World Bank in the preparation of an urban transport project which includes the purchase&#13;
of new transit equipment and the rehabilitation of buses, trams and trolleys for selected cities,&#13;
to provide spare parts for transit enterprises throughout Russia, and will fund a program of&#13;
technical assistance for municipal transport departments. The project will have the salutary&#13;
effect, over a two-year time span, of providing the incentive of a significant demand for buses&#13;
to spur the formation of joint ventures and other steps that will improve the competitiveness and&#13;
level of technology. The preparation of this project is complete, and new transit equipment&#13;
should start to be delivered to the participating Russian cities in the third or fourth quarter of&#13;
1996.&#13;
11.          The second step was to undertake an action program  to create the proper&#13;
environment for the development of a domestic transit equipment manufacturing industry. The&#13;
urban transport project therefore includes consulting services to assist and support this program.&#13;
The services will be to assist government in identifying the steps to be taken to provide the legal&#13;
and commercial environment in which its urban transport manufacturing industry can properly&#13;
develop and will be available to potentially viable manufacturing enterprises to assist them&#13;
directly with restructuring plans such that they are more favorably placed to obtain the necessary&#13;
capital investments so that the industry can be both efficient and competitive in not only helping&#13;
meet Russia's domestic needs, but also can build up an overseas demand for its vehicles and&#13;
components.&#13;
OBJWECrE&#13;
12.          The objective of the services is to assist and support the development and&#13;
upgrading of the Russian automotive transit manufacturing industry within a market oriented&#13;
environment.&#13;
13.          For the objective to be achieved, the following should have taken place by the&#13;
completion of the services: (i) at a macro level, the appropriate decision makers in government,&#13;
the domestic manufacturing industry and manufacturers worldwide should be familiar with the&#13;
state of the Russian domestic industry, its constraints to development, the steps that have been&#13;
and are being taken to remove or minimize the effect of these constraints, the likely domestic&#13;
and foreign market including trends in public transportation and the direction which the industry&#13;
is takcing and/or should take; (ii) at the industry level, potentially viable firms should have been&#13;
1.    For example, more than half of the bus fleet is powered by gasoline engines rather than by more efficient and less polluting diesel&#13;
engines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                                                                       Annex 5.3&#13;
selected, innovative management in place and such management given assistance with the&#13;
preparation of strategic and business plans including restructuring and technology and quality&#13;
upgrading investment plans. This will include, on request, a detailed review of production&#13;
practice and assistance with plans for upgrading. Selected firms should be familiar with the&#13;
availability of appropriate production process equipment and control technology. The firms'&#13;
management should be familiar with overseas production practices and modem management, and&#13;
with international banking and finance. In addition, for discussions and negotiations with banks&#13;
and potential joint venture partners and/or licensor, on request, a selected firm will have access&#13;
to negotiating advice and assistance - and some firms will have used these services. Firms will&#13;
also be given advice on the preparation of bids for domestic and overseas contracts.&#13;
14.         These terms of reference have been prepared on the understanding that, through&#13;
the Working Group, the MOT and its affiliates will provide most of the background material and&#13;
assist with analysis for work at the macro level. Thus, most of the consulting services will be&#13;
directed to work at industry level in partnership with the selected firms.&#13;
15.         General. The Russian Federation will oversee this project through a Working&#13;
Group that will be made up of representatives from the Ministries of Economy, Finance, and&#13;
Transport, the Automotive Industry Agency of the State Committee on Industrial Policy and the&#13;
GKI. The World Bank, which is financing this study, will be invited to send a representative to&#13;
the principal project decision and review meetings, as indicated in the description of the scope&#13;
of services below.&#13;
16.         The consulting services will be carried out in three phases:&#13;
Weeks&#13;
Phase 1:          Industry and Market Assessment                       12&#13;
Phase 2:          Selection of Potentially Viable Manufacturers        16&#13;
Phase 3:          Corporate and Technical Assistance                  76&#13;
Given the current dynamic situation in the industry and the previous work which has already&#13;
been undertaken, and the turbulent business climate, the phasing of the services and the timing&#13;
should be considered flexible. Thus, it is likely that preliminary work on firm selection will&#13;
begin concurrently with the industry and market assessment. Also, potential overseas joint&#13;
venture partners are likely to be furthering their contacts throughout the duration of the services&#13;
both with the consultants and with manufacturers. Both flexibility and these contacts are to be&#13;
encouraged but without compromising the integrity of the services and the goal of assisting&#13;
industry in developing its potential through the development of sound corporate strategies and&#13;
business plans.&#13;
PEASE 1: INDuSTRY AND MARKEr ASEssM&#13;
17.         The Overview. The consultants shall prepare an overview of the transit equipment&#13;
manufacturing industry both Russian and foreign, constraints to the development of the Russian&#13;
industry and trends to remove these, markets and market trends both Russian and foreign&#13;
(including trends in transit company ownership, financing, and government support), and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3                                                                         103&#13;
desirable and likely direction to be taken by the industry. The overview will receive wide&#13;
circulation and should be prepared for top government, industry and financial institutional levels&#13;
and also for distribution to those requiring more detail. The overview will give an enhanced&#13;
understanding of the industry and should set the stage for detailed technical and financial inputs&#13;
into potentially viable private sector companies.&#13;
18.          The Interational Industry. The overview should include a brief section on the&#13;
manufacturing industry worldwide with references to availability of more detailed information.&#13;
The consultants should highlight trends (e.g., the growth in trans-border manufacture) and make&#13;
comparisons which would be relevant and useful to the objectives of these services.&#13;
19.          The Russian Industry. The consultants shall review the state of the Russian transit&#13;
equipment manufacturing industry. For the purposes of these services, manufacturing will&#13;
include manufacturing, assembly, rebuilding and rehabilitation of both vehicles and components.&#13;
Transit equipment shall be defined as gasoline, diesel and natural gas powered buses, electrically&#13;
powered trolleybuses and trams and the components which go to make these vehicles. Other than&#13;
trams, the study will not cover rail equipment. The industry has been reviewed already by the&#13;
government and, to a limited extent, by the World Bank and by major international&#13;
manufacturers as potential and actual joint venture partners. Through interviews and written&#13;
material, the consultants will make every effort to make use of and not duplicate previous work.&#13;
Nevertheless, the consultants will be expected to use their own judgement in determining the&#13;
accuracy and appropriateness of previous work and conclusions reached.&#13;
20.          The overview will cover individual firms, associations of manufacturers and the&#13;
industry as a whole. The overview will be backed up by details covering each firm.2 At this&#13;
stage a protocol will have to be established giving guidance to all involved with the services as&#13;
to the confidentiality and circulation of information concerning an individual firm. In the interest&#13;
of promoting a truly competitive industry in a market orientated environment, the details of&#13;
individual business plans are likely to be extremely confidential with some details remaining&#13;
confidential between the firm and the consultants only.&#13;
21.          For each firm (inter alia) the following information will be covered:&#13;
(i)    Ownership, capitalization, stock valuation company structure including any joint&#13;
venture arrangements. Policies regarding seeking partners, (e.g., foreign bus&#13;
manufacturer, engine supplier and/or financier).&#13;
(ii)   The organization, including that of management and, if a joint venture, the role&#13;
of the respective partners.&#13;
(iii) Overall turnover and some basic financial information on sales, accounts&#13;
receivable, production costs and pricing strategies.&#13;
2.    Lniits on finn size to be agreed on during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                                                                        Annex 5.3&#13;
(iv)   Production facilities and their condition including environmental measures needed.&#13;
(v)   Quality control.&#13;
(vi)  If a joint venture, the role of the respective partners in production - particularly&#13;
in quality control.&#13;
(vii)  Staffing structure, numbers, redundancy policy.&#13;
(viii) Accounting and management systems and the extent to which these are being&#13;
modernized and, for example, reflect day-to-day production and cash flow.&#13;
(ix)   Have any outside management studies taken place.&#13;
(x)   The source of tools, materials and components and procurement policy, and the&#13;
respective extent of vertical integration and outsourcing.&#13;
(xi)  The product development facilities, e.g., R&amp;D, design, modelling, testing, etc..&#13;
(xii)  Domestic and export marketing strategies - e.g., customer surveys, market&#13;
studies, market testing business plans, etc..&#13;
(xiii) The warranty provisions and how these are met.&#13;
(xiv)  After sales service - distribution and service networks - policy and practice.&#13;
(xv)  Such other information as the consultants deem necessary.&#13;
22.         Again, the consultants should note that, through a previous World Bank mission,&#13;
several of the major firms have already supplies some of this information to the MOT. However,&#13;
the information will require to be reviewed for appropriateness. In particular, and most likely&#13;
in Phase 2, the state of the production facilities and plans for upgrading will require close&#13;
technical attention.&#13;
23.         The consultants will use this industry information to determine the approach to&#13;
be used during Phase 2 to review in detail individual manufacturing firms potential.&#13;
24.         The Constraints. The constraints to the development of the industry also appear&#13;
well known - particularly the slow evolution of a financial and legal infrastructure conducive to&#13;
business development. The consultants should review these, confirm the macro constraints and&#13;
at industry level, identify in detail the effect of these constraints. This review should include&#13;
potential joint venture partners' perception and experience of these constraints.&#13;
25.         The industries' desire for capital investment is also well known. On an overview&#13;
basis, the consultants should recommend the steps that should be taken during Phase 2 to assess&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3                                                                      105&#13;
the appropriateness of such capital investment. For example, business plans should be prepared&#13;
on reasonable market expectations, not on past models, quality, productivity or production.&#13;
26.         The Market. The consultants shall give an overview of the existing and potential&#13;
market both in Russia and overseas. The overview will be supported by an analysis of trends in&#13;
public transportation including, for example, the effect of the increase in car ownership, setting&#13;
fares to give reasonable cost recovery, the effect of possible deregulation and the entry of private&#13;
sector operating companies. The consultants will draw heavily on experience in other countries.&#13;
To the extent possible, the consultants should give examples of the marketing strategies of major&#13;
international manufacturers.&#13;
PHASE 2. SELECrION OF PoTENTIALLY VuABLE MANFwACITuRES&#13;
27.         The purpose of this Phase is to select potentially viable manufacturers and provide&#13;
them with technical assistance. Manufacturers selected at this stage must be privately-owned joint&#13;
stock companies, with the exception that enterprises that are well-advanced in the process of&#13;
privatization may be selected for inclusion on a case-by-case basis. The consultants will execute&#13;
this Phase in two tasks.&#13;
28.         The first task will comprise presenting to and agreeing with the Working Group&#13;
a "long" list of potentially viable manufacturers. Through analysis, develop a 'short" list of&#13;
manufacturers who will receive technical assistance through the consultant's services. The aim&#13;
would be to agree on the short list within a reasonably short time after the start of Phase 2 so&#13;
that direct assistance to these firms could begin.&#13;
29. !       The information and analysis needed to select potentially viable manufacturers will&#13;
have begun under Phase 1. At the start of Phase 2, a preliminary screening can probably take&#13;
place to give the "long" list of 112 manufacturers for submission to the Working Group. At that&#13;
time the consultants would also present their methodology and criteria for the selection of the&#13;
short list. This screening would include a review of government's proposed candidate&#13;
manufacturers. However, the consultant's recommended "long' list to the Working Group would&#13;
be based on their analysis and would not be predetermined.&#13;
30.         The second task would follow agreement on the "long" list. The listed firms&#13;
would be subject to a detailed review which would include (inter alia) the firm prepared business&#13;
plan, including restructuring proposals and financial state, products, production facilities, and&#13;
management. The objective being to select about six firms that, given certain assistance, have&#13;
the potential to be a viable concerns. The consultant's recommended "short" list would then be&#13;
submitted to the Working Group for agreement.&#13;
PuSE 3. CoR0ORATE AD TECHICAL AssIrsANcE&#13;
31.         Phase 3, providing direct assistance to the selected firms is the main thrust of the&#13;
services. The nature of this assistance will require a change in the role of the consulting&#13;
services. In Phases 1 and 2, the consultants were clearly reporting to the Working Group and&#13;
submitting material for the Group's agreement. In providing direct assistance to the firms, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                                                                          Annex 5.3&#13;
consultants will now be working on behalf of these firms and dealing with confidential issues.&#13;
Indeed, for the preparation of business plans, the consultants will need to put together a panel&#13;
of advisers such that, where two firms are likely to be in completion, each has a separate&#13;
adviser. Thus one of the first tasks of Phase 3 will be for the consultants to prepare a proposal&#13;
on the working arrangements which would best meet the needs of dealing with these different&#13;
firms on sensitive issues. This would include agreeing a protocol on the classification of a firm's&#13;
material. These proposals could well be on the lines of creating a small separate Center for&#13;
Consultations and Advice and Assistance (CCAA).&#13;
32.          After agreement on the arrangements by the Working Group, the consultants will&#13;
meet with each firm and agree on an assistance program. This will vary according to the firm,&#13;
but will take the form where each firm clearly has ownership of the output. The consultants will&#13;
act as advisers and facilitators to the firm's management and will not be imposing outside plans&#13;
and strategy on the firm.&#13;
33.          Specific assistance will probably be provided in the areas of corporate strategy,&#13;
market review, detailed business and financial planning (including operational, investment and&#13;
financing cash flows) revisiting the firm's previously prepared business plan, cost control, advice&#13;
on international finance, advice on environmental policy, impact projections and remedial&#13;
measures. Training will play a large part in the assistance to be given. This will include not only&#13;
trail)ing by the consultants but also arranging opportunities for training both in Russia and&#13;
overseas.&#13;
34.          Assistance will also be provided in locating and introducing potential providers&#13;
of finance and technology. The level and timing of the assistance will once again depend on the&#13;
firm and the contact it has already made. The process will include: (i) identification of potential&#13;
sources of debt and equity financing (including IFC, EBRD, investment bankers, venture&#13;
capitalists and eligible joint venture partners); (ii) identification of potential technology alliance&#13;
partners; and (iii) introducing firms to appropriate investors/partners and assisting in&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
35.          While these terms of reference have been prepared on the basis of providing&#13;
assistance to only preselected firms, it could well be that the CCAA might be able to take "walk&#13;
in" customers - particularly to provide advice to smaller component manufacturers. Similarly,&#13;
while potential foreign joint venture partners are usually very 'au fait' with the state of the&#13;
industry, it also likely that they will be constant visitors at the CCAA. Under these&#13;
circumstances the consultants will be expected to provide advice and assistance to these visitors&#13;
which is not just limited to the short listed firms.&#13;

URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5.4&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
ASSISTANCE TO THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT&#13;
1.          Background. As part of the transition by the Government of the Russian&#13;
Federation to a new govemment and economic system, it is appropriate for the role of the&#13;
Ministry of Transport (MOT) to be modified as cities take responsibility for their own transit&#13;
systems and as the transit equipment manufacturing enterprises restructure and prepare to enter&#13;
the private sector. These terms of reference (TOR) provide for assistance with a number of tasks&#13;
that MOT's Automobile Transport Department is planning to undertake.&#13;
2.          Objectives. The main objective of this project is to equip MOT for its evolving&#13;
role in the urban transport sector. Specific objectives relate to following needs to: (a) provide&#13;
opportunities for key officials at the federal level to observe new approaches to the&#13;
administration of the urban transport sector and to observe transit equipment manufacturing&#13;
outside of Russia; (b) develop a consistent body of information about the sector and its&#13;
performance; (c) improve methods for the handling of fare exemptions; and (d) disseminate&#13;
information about best practices in the field of urban transport.&#13;
3.          Scope of Consulting Services. The Russian Federation has the following services&#13;
for which it seeks this consulting assistance under this one contract: (a) study trips and diagnostic&#13;
missions; (b) development of a sector information system; (c) improvement of the handling of&#13;
fare exemptions; and (d) education and training. These services are described in detail below.&#13;
STUDY MISSIONS&#13;
A. MODERNIZATION OF URBAN PASSENGER TRANSPORT POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.          Objective. To inform central government officials involved in the administration&#13;
of urban transport of the lessons of experience and modern practices in urban transport&#13;
administration and to formulate recommendations on how to implement such practices in Russia.&#13;
5.          Main Tasks. The consultants will organize a program of visits and seminars for&#13;
two groups of about 10-15 persons to visit four European cities in two countries: two cities that&#13;
are national capital cities, in which the group will meet with national government officials and&#13;
experts involved in policy making and administration for the sector; and two cities in which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
110                                                                             Annex 5.4&#13;
public transport companies will be visited.' In addition, the cities visited to observe urban&#13;
transport entities should have these characteristics: (a) one of the cities visited will be of a size&#13;
of at least one mission population; (b) the average cost recovery of urban transport in these cities&#13;
should be at least 60 percent; and (c) the cities should exhibit the significant use of private sector&#13;
firms in the provision of urban transport services. There will be two identical trips with an&#13;
interval of about two months in order to keep the groups to a manageable size and maximize the&#13;
chance for participation by high level Russian officials and managers.&#13;
6.           The main subjects to be discussed will be the following:&#13;
(a)    Roles of central and local governments in urban transport;&#13;
(b)   Governance of public transport enterprises, contractual relationships between the&#13;
companies and the government, performance assessment;&#13;
(c)    Tariff and  subsidy  policies,  their  implementation  in  the  control of&#13;
government/enterprise contractual relationships, and revenues for subsidies;&#13;
(d)    Actual and potential role of the private sector, innovative approaches and their&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(e)    Urban transport planning; and&#13;
(f)    General organization and management of public transport companies.&#13;
7.           The seminars and field trips will be designed to give to the participants an&#13;
overview of the main issues, lessons of experience, and best practices today in urban transport&#13;
in Europe. The emphasis will be on (i) urban transport policies and ways and means of&#13;
implementation; and (ii) enterprise organization and management and the incentive and control&#13;
systems to minimize costs of a given level of service. The main urban transport modes to be&#13;
considered will be urban buses, trolleybuses and, to a lesser extent, trams. Very little attention&#13;
will be devoted to metros and suburban railways.&#13;
8.           The seminars will include well-prepared presentations with extensive use of&#13;
audiovisual and distribution of written materials in Russian. Although only four cities in two&#13;
countries will be visited for practical reasons, interesting solutions developed in other countries&#13;
will also be presented.&#13;
B. IMROVEMENT IN ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF VEHICLE MANUFACTIG&#13;
9.           Objective. To acquaint concerned federal officials with vehicle manufacturing&#13;
practices in countries that have competitive and financially viable transit equipment&#13;
manufacturing industries. The group of officials should include, to the greatest extent possible,&#13;
1.    The cities in which companies will be visied will be selected for the efficiency of their transport systems and the innovate&#13;
solutions they have developed and integrated in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.4                                                                      111&#13;
Russian federal officials who are members of the Working Group on the study of the Russian&#13;
Transit Equipment Manufacturing Sector being carried out under the project. The field visits&#13;
should be carried out at an early stage in the conduct of the manufacturing study. The aim&#13;
should be to convey how manufacturing urban bus and electronic transport is organized and&#13;
managed, and to recommend how to implement such practices in Russia.&#13;
10.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Organization of a program of visits and seminars for a group of about 25&#13;
government and transit enterprise officials in developed countries. The&#13;
manufacturers to be visited will be selected for the quality and level of technology&#13;
of their products, their quality control, their cost effectiveness, and for their&#13;
overall management. The study trip will last about two weeks and include field&#13;
visit coverage of:&#13;
(i)   general organization of manufacturing;&#13;
(ii)  financial structure of the firm;&#13;
(iii)   manufacturing processes and quality control procedures;&#13;
(iv)  incentive systems for managers and workers - control and supervision;&#13;
(v)   role of outside firms in providing parts and supplies;&#13;
(vi)  information management systems, including finance, accounting, and&#13;
manufacturing options; and&#13;
(vii)  training and education of managerial, clerical, and production line&#13;
employees.&#13;
(b)   Immediately before the return to Russia of the group, two experts among the&#13;
main contributors to the study trip will conduct a "lessons learned" seminar for&#13;
the group, producing a memorandum for the record about the most significant&#13;
professional aspects of the trip. The experts will help the group draw conclusions&#13;
about the potentially most valuable solution to Russia's most pressing problems&#13;
in the manufacturing sector, based, in particular, on the state-of-the-art practices&#13;
observed during the trip.&#13;
DEVELOPMwr OF A SECTOR INFORMATION SYSrEM&#13;
11.         Objective. To develop, at the federal level, an information system that will, on&#13;
an annual basis, gather, analyze, and disseminate data on all aspects of Russia's urban transport&#13;
system as an aid to policy making, government administration, enterprise management and&#13;
research and analysis.&#13;
12.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Establish and secure approval for a set of data on the urban transport sector to be&#13;
gathered annually. At a minimum, the data should cover information on all&#13;
aspects of urban transport to include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112                                                                       Annex 5.4&#13;
*     equipment fleets - types, numbers, ages&#13;
*     capital needs - annual replacement rates, rehabilitation plans&#13;
*     operations - annual vehicle-kilometers by type of vehicle and per-vehicle&#13;
average, route kilometers, out-of-service ratio&#13;
*     finance - basic information from the income statement and balance sheet&#13;
*     ridership - numbers, average fare, percent of fare evaders, percent&#13;
exempt from fares.&#13;
(b)   Establish a data gathering and collection system for data on the urban transport&#13;
sector, design the reporting formats, and assemble a mock-up report; circulate for&#13;
review and comment.&#13;
(c)   Prepare training materials on the system and carry out pilot training sessions to&#13;
vet the training materials and train local personnel to conduct the training.&#13;
ELTINATioN OF EXEMPTIONS OR REIMBURSEmENT TO THE CITIES FOR THEIR COSTS&#13;
13.         Costs. To provide the information and analysis essential to MOT and MOF to use&#13;
in revising the system of fare exemptions to limit exemptions and reduced fares for special&#13;
groups to only the most needy. Principal possible changes include elimination of categories of&#13;
exempt passengers (or reducing the percentage of fare reduction) for those not financially in&#13;
need, and devising a system for direct reimbursement to transit companies for those exempt&#13;
riders that they must and do carry. Another approach to be explored is to provide financing for&#13;
urban transport services directly to members of the exempt categories.&#13;
14.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Review the system of fare exemptions and reduced fares at the federal level and&#13;
determine the financial impact of those policies on all levels of government.&#13;
(b)   Examine the rationale for fare exemptions and reduced fares and identify the&#13;
cases where this rationale may be weak, in particular because it may not be&#13;
consistent with the central government's social policies or because the objectives&#13;
may be achieved more effectively by other means.&#13;
(c)   Prepare recommendations on how to reform and simplify the system, including&#13;
proposals for implementation (possibly by stages).&#13;
(d)   Assist MOF and MOT in implementing the measures that they have, after review&#13;
of the consultants' proposals, decided to undertake.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 5.4                                                                            113&#13;
EDUCATION AND TRAING&#13;
15.          Objectives. To design a system of training and information dissemination to help&#13;
key government officials achieve three goals: (i) to encourage cities that did not participate in&#13;
the first project to participate in potential follow-on replications of the project; (ii) to disseminate&#13;
to transit officials in all Russian cities the results of the technical assistance provided to the&#13;
project cities; and (iii) to inform urban transport officials at all levels of the improvements&#13;
achieved in the fields of urban transport services so that they can more effectively carry out their&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
16.          Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)    Design a series of seminars through which key federal officials can inform cities&#13;
not participating in the first project of the benefits and requirements of project&#13;
participation to promote the replication of the project.&#13;
(b)   Develop a system  for the dissemination of the analytical products from  the&#13;
technical assistance to the cities so that the research, analysis and recommendation&#13;
can be made available to municipal transport departments and transit operating&#13;
enterprises throughout Russia.&#13;
(c)   Prepare a design for the establishment of a technology transfer information system&#13;
to make available to all cities in Russia data on the most recent developments&#13;
conceming all aspects of the management, operation, planning, equipping,&#13;
financing, and maintenance/rehabilitation of urban transport systems.&#13;

URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5.5&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
ASSISTANCE FOR URBAN TRANSPORT VEHICLE REHABHLITATION&#13;
1.         Introduction. The Russian Federation and the World Bank have prepared an Urban&#13;
Transport Project to assist self-selected Russian cities in supporting urban transit. One of the&#13;
components of the project is a program of bus, trolleybus and tram rehabilitation and improved&#13;
garage maintenance.&#13;
2.          An integral component of the rehabilitation program is the training of mechanics,&#13;
tradesmen and supervisors in the various cities in two specific areas: body work (particularly in&#13;
corrosion prevention) and welding.&#13;
3.          Objective. The objectives of this program are to: (a) review the list of buses,&#13;
trolleybuses and trams to be rehabilitated under the loan for each city; (b) review the list of&#13;
workshop equipment for each city to be financed under the loan; (c) acquaint primary&#13;
representatives (maintenance/garage management and foremen/tradesmen), designated as lead&#13;
rehabilitation personnel, with modem methods and procedures for the successful rehabilitation&#13;
of urban transport vehicles; (d) convey how facilities and personnel are best organized and&#13;
utilized to provide quality rehabilitation in an efficient, timely and cost-effective manner;&#13;
(e) assist the transit companies with the contracting out of vehicle rehabilitation; (f) provide&#13;
supervision of the ongoing rehabilitation program; and (g) to acquaint rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance personnel with cost-efficient and environmentally safe techniques for the disposal&#13;
of non-recyclable wastes (engine fluids, tires, etc.).&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
4.          Identification of Needs. For each project city the consultants will draw up detailed&#13;
lists of vehicles to be rehabilitated, a list of spare parts to carry out the rehabilitation work, and&#13;
workshop equipment required to carry out adequate repair and rehabilitation of all transit&#13;
companies' vehicles. To identify needs, the consultants will:&#13;
(a)   Review the criteria outlined in the attached annex for rehabilitating vehicles to be&#13;
included in the rehabilitation component of the project. The review should include&#13;
an analysis of substituting locally manufactured diesel engines for the gasoline&#13;
engines of LiAZ buses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                                                                             Annex 5.5&#13;
(b)    Visit each city and identify the buses, trolleybuses and trams to be included in the&#13;
rehabilitation component of the project. The information provided should include:&#13;
* vehicle identification number (VIN), local vehicle number, make and model&#13;
* type of rehabilitation required&#13;
* spare parts/materials list&#13;
(c)    Provide an analysis of each garage/depot that describes the existing conditions of&#13;
the facility in relation to lighting level, heat, adequate space, shop equipment,&#13;
shop facilities, shop tools, and personal hand tools. Based on this analysis,&#13;
provide a detailed list of equipment and tools that are required to improve the&#13;
repair and rehabilitation of vehicles in the garage/depot.&#13;
5.           Meeting the above requires:&#13;
* a visit to each garage/depot in each project city.&#13;
- identification of specific candidate vehicles by garages, prior to the meeting.&#13;
- stripping down sample prototype vehicles by garages.&#13;
6.           Training&#13;
(a)    The consultants will arrange for mechanical staff, foremen, supervisors and&#13;
managers of garages, all designated as lead rehabilitation personnel, to visit&#13;
maintenance/repair facilities (rehabilitation facilities if available abroad probably&#13;
in Western Europe). The facilities should service vehicles operating under similar&#13;
climatic conditions to their Russian counterparts and demonstrate good&#13;
professional practices.&#13;
(b)    Specific training for buses, trolleybuses and trams will be carried out only for&#13;
those transit companies that are carrying out rehabilitation in-house. Training as&#13;
needed, will be provided for designated lead rehabilitation personnel from cities'&#13;
garages where rehabilitation works will be carried out. Qualification testing shall&#13;
be performed at qualified facilities in the specific areas of high quality welding&#13;
and painting/finishing. The consultant will develop training materials suitable for&#13;
classroom and hands-on training, including instructor's manual, hand-out&#13;
materials, list of suggested materials/equipment for hands-on training, and&#13;
supervisor's summaries of training program.&#13;
(c)    Training in rehabilitation of vehicles will be carried out for rehabilitation&#13;
specialists, split into groups of project cities. Different types of specialists may&#13;
attend where parallel activity is determined to be beneficial to the program. The&#13;
consultants will demonstrate how to rehabilitate selected vehicles to each group&#13;
of cities.&#13;
In each group of cities (or possibly one city, if sufficiently large enough),&#13;
for each vehicle type (bus, trolleybus and tram), set up a prototype&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.5                                                                          117&#13;
rehabilitation location in a garage/depot. Upgrade the space as needed, so&#13;
as to demonstrate pilot rehabilitation activities.&#13;
Key designated staff from  garages/depots will be assembled at the&#13;
designated prototype rehabilitation facilities, and trained by the&#13;
rehabilitation experts who will rotate through the different prototype&#13;
locations. There should be at least one maintenance/supervisory staff from&#13;
a garage/depot where rehabilitation works will be carried out, with a&#13;
maximum of six attending the training.&#13;
Each participating city shall be permitted to submit one selected vehicle&#13;
of each vehicle type for the primary prototype rehabilitation facility where&#13;
that city's personnel are being trained. This vehicle will be rehabilitated&#13;
as part of the training program and returned with the city's personnel at&#13;
the end of their training. All vehicles submitted may be utilized in the&#13;
training of all the personnel from the various project cities attending the&#13;
particular prototype facility. Shipment of the vehicle to and from the&#13;
prototype facility is the responsibility of the city owning the vehicle, but&#13;
can be financed under the loan. Supply of materials for specific vehicle&#13;
rehabilitation shall be the responsibility of the city: the necessary parts can&#13;
be procured under the loan by direct contracting if necessary. Workshop&#13;
equipment will be provided by the host city. Where the city does not have&#13;
essential items of equipment, the parts will be procured under the loan&#13;
(through direct contracting, if necessary).&#13;
"Rehabilitation peer trainers' will be selected from each participating city&#13;
and given training in all the major rehabilitation techniques necessary to&#13;
the program. They will be given a one to two day training program&#13;
including video, classroom presentation and hands-on training.&#13;
7.           Rehabilitation by Contract. With the cities, the consultants will confirm or revise&#13;
the type and number of vehicles which would be suitable for rehabilitation by contract, identify&#13;
and visit likely rehabilitation companies, develop appropriate specifications and contracting&#13;
procedures for PID and World Bank approval, develop a rehabilitation by contract program,&#13;
assist the cities and PID with the bidding and evaluation process, and assist in setting up&#13;
adequate vehicle examination, supervision and inspection procedures. In particular, the&#13;
consultants will (inter alia):&#13;
(a)   Agree on the number and type of vehicles suitable for rehabilitation by contract.&#13;
Agree also on up to ten vehicles in urgent need of rehabilitation which might be&#13;
rehabilitated on a trial basis under International Shopping procurement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
(b)   Following an advertisement inviting expressions of interest to be placed by the&#13;
PID locally and in adjoining countries where the distance is such that vehicles&#13;
could be shipped there on an economic basis, visit some selected plants to gain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118                                                                            Annex 5.5&#13;
an insight into their standards of work, quality assurance procedures, likely costs,&#13;
possible contracting arrangements and inspection procedures.&#13;
(c)    Develop draft specifications, examination procedures, contract documents and&#13;
inspection procedures and a first year contract rehabilitation program for PID and&#13;
World Bank review and approval.&#13;
(d)   After agreement on (c) and through PID, assist the cities with Limited&#13;
International Bidding process, including bid evaluation, post qualification (if&#13;
necessary), advice on bus delivery schedules, examination and inspection&#13;
procedures.&#13;
(e)    Assist in monitoring the program and, with lessons learned, setting up the next&#13;
year's program.&#13;
8.           Supervision of Rehabilitation Program. The consultants will rotate among the&#13;
various project cities providing technical assistance for vehicle rehabilitation. Each city will be&#13;
visited twice in the first year of the project and once in the second and third years of the project.&#13;
9.           Non-Recyclable Wastes. The consultants will demonstrate to garage/depot&#13;
personnel how to dispose of non-recyclable wastes, such as engine fluids, tires, etc., in an&#13;
environmentally safe and cost-efficient way.&#13;
10.          Time Schedule. Training and supervision of the rehabilitation program will be&#13;
provided for a period of three years. The identification of vehicles to be rehabilitated, workshop&#13;
equipment to be financed under the loan and potential rehabilitation contractors will be carried&#13;
out in the first two months of the assignment. The training of groups of mechanical staff using&#13;
prototype vehicles and assistance with the contracting out of rehabilitation will be carried out in&#13;
the first five months of the assignment. Other training will be carried out in the first nine months&#13;
of the assignment. Supervision activities will take place throughout the three years of the&#13;
assignment.&#13;
11.          Reports. The consultants will submit a short report within two months of the&#13;
assignment, including the list of vehicles to be rehabilitated, workshop equipment for each city,&#13;
the training program, and the list of potential rehabilitation contractors. Thereafter, short&#13;
quarterly reports will be submitted on the progress of the vehicle rehabilitation program.&#13;

ANNEX 5.6&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE CITIES&#13;
The following three sets of terms of reference are all aimed at improving transit&#13;
organization and operations in the 14 project cities.&#13;
TERmS OF REFERENCE A:&#13;
ASSISTANCE TO PROJECT CiTIES'&#13;
TRANSPORT REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND URBAN TRANSPORT COMPANIES&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.          The Russian Federation is undertaking a project (the Project) to support urban&#13;
transport reforms in a number of cities, arrest the decline in urban transport services throughout&#13;
the Federation and provide restructuring advice to the domestic bus manufacturing industry. The&#13;
total project cost estimate is US$391 million dollars equivalent and will be financed by the&#13;
Russian Federation, the World Bank, the European Union (EU) and possibly other international&#13;
donors. The Ministry of Finance is the Borrower and the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the&#13;
Implementing Agency. Funds will be onlent to the project cities for new vehicles, rehabilitation&#13;
of vehicles, pfovision of workshop equipment and technical assistance.&#13;
2.          Current Situation and Basis for the Project. With 74 percent of its population&#13;
living in urban areas and car ownership only about 6 cars per 100 inhabitants, compared to over&#13;
40 in Western Europe, Russia is more dependent upon public transport services than any other&#13;
nation with a similar level of income. Urban transport carried 41.8 billion passengers in 1991,&#13;
representing an 85 percent share of passenger transportation by all modes, compared to 20&#13;
percent in Western Europe and 3 percent in the United States. Russia has one of the three largest&#13;
urban public transport fleets in the world, with about 105,000 buses providing regularly&#13;
scheduled urban and suburban service, but is small in terms of vehicles per population.&#13;
Moreover, the fleet is shrinking. Fast deteriorating equipment conditions, driven by&#13;
unavailability of funds to upgrade and maintain existing fleets, are resulting in out-of-service&#13;
ratios between 60 percent to 70 percent of the fleet in most cities and break-downs are as high&#13;
as 20 percent of the fleet. Low service levels are developing as a result; vehicles are&#13;
overcrowded, averaging over nine passengers per sq.m. at peak and waiting times have increased&#13;
considerably. Similar, but less severe, problems prevail with tram and trolleybus companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120                                                                            Annex 5.6&#13;
3.           The lack of funds, together with the increasing costs and declining domestic&#13;
production of buses and increased cost of imported diesel-powered buses has left public transport&#13;
companies without the means to replace its fleet and sustain operations. Low cost recovery from&#13;
fares, together with a high number of fare dodgers and fare exemptions (at least one-third of the&#13;
population and as high as 70-80 percent in some cities), and an inflationary environment have&#13;
increased urban transport companies' operating losses to an estimated Rbl.0 trillion in 1993,&#13;
roughly 6 percent of GDP. At the same time, as a part of the pattern of general reform,&#13;
combined with the fiscal crisis of the central Government, the responsibility for capital and&#13;
operating subsides to the urban transport industry has devolved, of necessity, and by decree, to&#13;
the local level. Local governments, which have increasing responsibilities to subsidize other&#13;
sectors as well as an often insufficient tax revenue base, will have difficulty funding transport&#13;
losses. Reforms to improve cost recovery, eliminate fare exemptions and fight fare evaders are&#13;
greatly needed so that a greater portion of existing subsidies can be used to finance vehicle&#13;
replacement and other capital needs. In the longer term, Russia's urban transport sector also&#13;
needs access to more fuel-efficient vehicles (about half the Russian bus fleet is gasoline rather&#13;
than diesel-powered, and is about 40 percent less fuel efficient) and to develop competitive&#13;
procurement procedures that will eventually stimulate a competitive bus manufacturing industry&#13;
within Russia that offers more energy efficient, less-polluting and longer lasting buses.&#13;
4.           During project preparation, the Bank worked with a number of cities to encourage&#13;
them to put forward urban transport reform programs. The project will assist fourteen&#13;
self-selected candidate cities which have met a minimum program of urban transport reforms,&#13;
including particularly doubling or trebling cost recovery ratios, as a condition for inclusion of&#13;
the project. The 14 cities include five of the nation's thirteen cities over one million population&#13;
and range from 116,000 (Velikie Luki) to 1.5 million people (Nizhniy Novgorod). All the cities&#13;
except Omsk are in the European part of Russia. The most stringent requirement for inclusion&#13;
has been attainment of at least a 25 percent cost recovery ratio (excluding depreciation) for the&#13;
secqnd quarter of 1994.&#13;
5.           Main Objective of the Project. The main objective of the project is to help the&#13;
Federal Government replicate reforms and develop more effective urban transport policies&#13;
throughout the country by demonstrating the effectiveness of reforms in fourteen self-selected&#13;
cities, including increasing cost recovery, restructuring the sector, establishing autonomous&#13;
transit entities, and stimulating private participation in the sector. This objective is to be&#13;
accomplished by (a) linking financing of urgently needed replacement vehicles and spare parts&#13;
to improve vehicle availability to the implementation or reforms in fourteen cities; and&#13;
(b) strengthening urban transport institutions and improving the efficiency of passenger transport&#13;
operations. To assist cities in their efforts to improve cost recovery and to strengthen their&#13;
operations, the project will include the provision of technical assistance. The purpose of this&#13;
terms of reference is to detail the duties and responsibilities of assistance and training that are&#13;
provided to the project city municipal authorities and urban transport entities.&#13;
6.           Project Description. The entire project includes:&#13;
*     provision of 1,501 buses and 272 trolleybuses with spares for fourteen cities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.6                                                                           121&#13;
*     rehabilitation of about 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses and 380 trams;&#13;
*     provision of workshop, computers and other equipment for urban transit&#13;
companies, plus a fare collection system to be tested in one of the project cities;&#13;
*     technical assistance and training to assist the cities implement reforms and assist&#13;
with procurement and monitoring of the project;&#13;
*     assistance to MOT for studies of, and restructuring advice for, the domestic bus&#13;
industry and to provide technical assistance and training to assist MOT in&#13;
developing more appropriate urban transport policies for cities throughout Russia&#13;
to help replicate the project's policy reforms in other cities; and to assist in&#13;
preparation of a follow-on urban transport project;&#13;
*     provision of spare parts for transit companies throughout Russia.&#13;
7.           Project Benefits. The project will help alleviate the growing shortage of public&#13;
transport in the 14 project cities and thereby increase the quality of service. Major benefits in&#13;
the project cities include: (i) reduced passenger waiting times and severe overcrowding;&#13;
(ii) vehicle maintenance savings; (iii) higher level of availability of the urban transport vehicle&#13;
fleet; (iv) fuel savings, and (v) improved air quality. The project will also help improve the&#13;
efficiency of public transport services and the organization of the sector in the 14 project cites,&#13;
promote more reforms in other cities and economic urban transport policies at the national level,&#13;
improve the availability of existing vehicle fleets in cities throughout Russia and assist with the&#13;
development of a viable urban transport vehicle manufacturing industry in Russia. The&#13;
unquantifiable benefits include important organizational reforms that will be carried out&#13;
including: (i) establishment of autonomous transit agencies completely separate from the oblast&#13;
or municipal governments; (ii) municipal governments and transit companies entering into&#13;
contracts to set performance targets and encourage greater efficiency for the provision of transit&#13;
services; (iii) municipalities establishing transport departments to regulate transit services;&#13;
(iv) the introduction of private transport services on a trial basis; and (v) divestiture of non-urban&#13;
transport services and taxi services from municipal ownership.&#13;
8.           Objectives. A main objective of the assignment is for cities to achieve increasing&#13;
cost recovery ratios by raising fares, decreasing the number of fare evaders, ensuring the&#13;
payment to transit companies by government of fares for exempt or non-exempt passengers and&#13;
making transit operations more efficient. These reforms, which concern tariff levels and fare&#13;
collection, subsidies, improvement of contractual relationships between the companies and the&#13;
local governments, privatization of competing urban transport entities such as taxis, inter-city&#13;
buses, mini buses and route taxis, are aimed at creating an environment which encourages a&#13;
more efficient provision of urban transport services. Another main objective of the loan is to&#13;
assist the public transport companies in the project cities to modernize and improve the&#13;
organization, management, and work practices, in line with the experience gained in other&#13;
countries. The provision of services described will help transit entities in the project cities&#13;
achieve these objectives.&#13;
&#13;

9.          Scope of Work. The consultants will provide assistance to the project cities and&#13;
transit enterprises:&#13;
(a)   To enable them to meet the project's reform measures and performance targets.&#13;
(b)   To improve the system of fare exemption and the collection of fares.&#13;
These services are described in detail below.&#13;
ENABLiNG PROJEcT CITIES TO MEET THE PRoJEcT's REFORM MEASURES AND&#13;
PERFORMANCE TARGETS&#13;
10.         Objectives. The objectives are: (a) to improve and put in place computerized&#13;
budget preparation and cost accounting procedures so that they can be used as effective&#13;
management and supervision tools; (b) to develop and put in place management reporting&#13;
systems that enable transit managers and city administrators to monitor transport performance&#13;
against project targets and city goals; and (c) to assist transit companies and city administrations&#13;
in preparing quarterly performance reports required under the project.&#13;
11.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Review procedures currently used in the transit enterprises in the project cities for&#13;
recurrent and capital budget preparation and cost accounting. Identify their&#13;
strengths and weaknesses, particularly in terms of providing management the&#13;
information needed to monitor its performance against project targets.&#13;
(b)   Discuss with the transport companies the advantages and disadvantages of&#13;
procedures employed in various other (especially western) countries.&#13;
(c)   On the basis of the companies' comments, develop improved procedures that&#13;
(i) remain simple and adapted to the current economic transition period, (ii) make&#13;
it easy to take account of productivity improvements, (iii) provide a basis for&#13;
subsequent development and sophistication, and (iv) are easy to computerize.&#13;
These procedures should be well coordinated with the procedures prepared for&#13;
improving the subsidy system. They should also be decentralized with budget and&#13;
cost analysis being prepared at depot level before consolidation.&#13;
(d)   Develop a simple computerized cost accounting system for all project transit&#13;
companies. Assist with the procurement and installation of computers (financed&#13;
under the project) and install the cost accounting system for each project transit&#13;
company. Provide training for transit company staff in the use of the system.&#13;
(e)   Develop a simple compute program (for example, on the basis of spreadsheets)&#13;
to facilitate budget preparation and analysis and cost calculations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.6                                                                      123&#13;
(f)   Formulate recommendations regarding the annual schedule for preparation and&#13;
approval of the companies' budget and for preparation of reports on budget&#13;
implementation and on costs. Prepare standard reporting forms for the companies&#13;
managers and the city governments. The budget schedule and the reporting&#13;
requirements should be consistent with the schedule and reports proposed for&#13;
improving the subsidy allocation system and the contractual relationships between&#13;
the companies and the city governments.&#13;
(g)   Develop and implement management reporting systems that enable transit&#13;
company managers to monitor operating and financial results on a timely basis to&#13;
help in assessing process against project targets against good practices. This effort&#13;
should include developing criteria and techniques to relate investment to financial&#13;
performance: institute more comprehensive and longer term financial forecasting,&#13;
if possible, through development of a "tops down' forecasting model to enable&#13;
transit companies to determine break even and cost recovery levels under various&#13;
tariff, traffic and costing scenarios and to establish the general level of capital&#13;
expenditures required to implement alternative scenarios.&#13;
(h)   Develop formats for project monitoring and assist transit companies and city&#13;
administrations in preparing quarterly reports.&#13;
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTM OF FARE EXEMPTIONS AND FARE COLLECTION&#13;
12.         Objectives. To help local and oblast administrations to revise the system of fare&#13;
exemptions so as to limit exemptions and reduced fares for special groups to only the most needy&#13;
groups. To help transit companies revise fare collection procedures and methods of control so&#13;
as to limit to the greatest possible extent the number of passengers who do not pay.&#13;
13.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Review the system of fare exemptions and reduced fares in each of the project&#13;
cities and compare them with the systems used in various other countries.&#13;
(b)   Examine the rationale for fare exemptions and reduce fares and identify the cases&#13;
where this rationale may be weak, in particular because it may not be consistent&#13;
with the central government's social policies or because the objectives may be&#13;
achieved more effectively by other means.&#13;
(c)   Prepare recommendations on how to reform and simply the system, including&#13;
proposals for implementation (possibly by stages).&#13;
(d)   Review the procedures for collecting fares from the passengers and for controlling&#13;
payments and compare them with the procedures generally used in other&#13;
(especially western) countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                                                                       Annex 5.6&#13;
(e)   On the basis of the analysis in part (d) and taking account of the specific&#13;
characteristics of transport demand and vehicle fleet in the project cities, prepare&#13;
recommendation on how to improve fare collection, including proposals for&#13;
implementation (possibly by stages).&#13;
(f)    Assist the local governments and public transport companies in each of the project&#13;
cities implement the measures that they have then after review of the consultant's&#13;
proposals.&#13;
ORGANIZATION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
14.         The technical assistance inputs required will require a team of individuals skilled&#13;
in management, accounting and budgeting, and with extensive experience in the urban transport&#13;
sector. It is suggested that the technical assistance be comprised of a team that includes experts&#13;
that will visit the project cities on a rotating basis according to the particular needs of the cities&#13;
in the areas described above. One of the team should be designated as a team leader, with day-&#13;
t-day responsibility for the consulting aspects of the team's performance (as well as carrying&#13;
out above-mentioned consulting activities). The team leader will report to the unit chief&#13;
responsible for Technical Assistance within the Project Implementation Directorate (PID) and&#13;
to the Urban Transport Specialist in the PID. She/he will assist the project managers in the&#13;
project cities in preparing their quarterly reports. It is suggested that the team leader be based&#13;
in Moscow. The team leader should also develop a monitoring system for any action plans&#13;
developed by its members within project cities. She/he will assist the chief of the PID&#13;
monitoring unit in establishing a program of regular visits, reports and action follow-up between&#13;
the PID and project cities, and in developing a reporting system of such visits to the steering&#13;
committee.&#13;

operations, the project includes the provision of technical assistance. The purpose of this terms&#13;
of reference is to detail the duties and responsibilities of assistance and training that are to be&#13;
provided to the project city municipal authorities and urban transport entities.&#13;
6.           Project Description. The entire project includes:&#13;
*     provision of 1,501 buses and 272 trolleybuses with spares for fourteen cities;&#13;
*     rehabilitation of about 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses and 380 trams;&#13;
*     provision of workshop, computers and other equipment for urban transit&#13;
companies, plus a fare collection system to be tested in one of the project cities;&#13;
*     technical assistance and training to assist the cities implement reforms and assist&#13;
with procurement and monitoring of the project;&#13;
*     assistance to MOT for studies of, and restructuring advice for, the domestic bus&#13;
industry and to provide technical assistance and training to assist MOT in&#13;
developing more appropriate urban transport policies for cities throughout Russia&#13;
&#13;

Annex 5.6                                                                          129&#13;
to help replicate the project's policy reforms in other cities; and to assist in&#13;
preparation of a follow-on urban transport project;&#13;
*     provision of spare parts for transit companies throughout Russia.&#13;
7.           Project Benefits. The project helps to alleviate the growing shortage of public&#13;
transport in the 14 project cities and thereby increase the quality of service. Major benefits in&#13;
the project cities include: (i) reduced passenger waiting times and severe overcrowding; (ii)&#13;
vehicle maintenance savings; (iii) higher level of availability of the urban transport vehicle fleet;&#13;
(iv) fuel savings, and (v) improved air quality. The project also helps improve the efficiency of&#13;
public transport services and the organization of the sector in the 14 project cites, promote more&#13;
reforms in other cities and economic urban transport policies at the national level, improve the&#13;
availability of existing vehicle fleets in cities throughout Russia and assist with the development&#13;
of a viable urban transport vehicle manufacturing industry in Russia. The unquantifiable benefits&#13;
include important organizational reforms to be carried out including: (i) establishment of&#13;
autonomous transit agencies completely separate from the oblast or municipal governments; (ii)&#13;
municipal governments and transit companies entering into contracts to set performance targets&#13;
and encourage greater efficiency for the provision of transit services; (iii) municipalities&#13;
establishing transport departments to regulate transit services; (iv) the introduction of private&#13;
transport services on a trial basis; and (v) divestiture of non-urban transport services and taxi&#13;
services from municipal ownership.&#13;
8.           The difficulty of obtaining replacement vehicles for their urban transport&#13;
companies, particularly Ikarus-made buses, in conjunction with fuel shortages, has led a number&#13;
of municipal governments and transport experts to formulate plans to create new trolleybus or&#13;
tram companies (and, in one case, a metro) to expand transport capacity. In some cities, poles&#13;
and wires for the trolleybuses have already been installed, although it may be some time before&#13;
any trolleybuses are purchased. To the city governments, trolleybuses may seem to be a good&#13;
alternative to buying foreign buses because they are made in Russia and the price is so low. In&#13;
Western countries, trolleybuses are far costlier than diesel-powered buses (at US$300,000 to&#13;
US$500,000 each, at least twice as expensive as buses), but in Russia they are cheaper. Trams&#13;
are imported (mostly from the former Czechoslovakia) and so are far more expensive&#13;
(US$250,000 to US$300,000.) The analysis of new trolleybus or tram systems is quite complex&#13;
and would have to take account of all the economic costs and benefits and various options. Given&#13;
the financial problems of the cities and the need to rehabilitate vehicles and systems already in&#13;
place, it is important that any new investments in urban transport be subjected to detailed&#13;
analysis to if such investments are economically justified.&#13;
9.           Objectives. The objectives of this assignment are (i) to assess the relative&#13;
economics of each mode of urban transport (i.e., bus, trolleybus, tram and metro) in each of the&#13;
project cities; and (ii) to develop a least cost plan based on economic costs for the future&#13;
development of the urban transport system in each project city for the next five years.&#13;
10.         Scope of Work. For each project city the scope of work includes:&#13;
(a)   Analysis of existing transport data and conducting transport surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
130                                                                           Annex 5.6&#13;
(b)   Review of urban development plans and identification of potential economic&#13;
restructuring at the local level that could affect the demand for urban transport&#13;
services.&#13;
(c)   Preparation of traffic demand forecasts based on different scenarios of economic&#13;
conditions and strategies for managing demand for urban transport services, such&#13;
as staggered work hours.&#13;
(d)   Estimation of financial and economic operating costs for all modes or urban&#13;
transport, to be estimated in conjunction with consultants working on establishing&#13;
a cost accounting system for the transit companies. Projection of the real increase&#13;
in costs, particularly where financial prices do not reflect economic costs.&#13;
(e)   Preparation of cost estimates for each strategy to enable economic and financial&#13;
analyses to be carried out.&#13;
(f)    Preparation of transport strategies (single or multi-mode, depending on the city),&#13;
for the next five years, taking into account the scarcity of financial resources and&#13;
the need to stress low cost measures and policy interventions, and likely change&#13;
in costs of urban transport.&#13;
(g)   Evaluation of alternative strategies in quantitative (capacity, operation, economic,&#13;
financial, environmental) and qualitative terms.&#13;
(h)   Refinement and selection of least cost urban transport investment strategy for the&#13;
next five years, taking into account the likely availability of financial resources.&#13;
The above tasks vary in magnitude, depending on the size of the city. Some of the smaller cities&#13;
only have one mode of transport, while the larger cities have all modes - bus, trolleybus, tram&#13;
and metro.&#13;
11.         To the extent possible, the economic and financial analysis should be kept simple&#13;
and urban transport plans limited to key investment decisions that need to be taken over the next&#13;
five years. The primary focus of the economic and financial analysis is to include the size of bus&#13;
for different routes according to passenger traffic levels, possible role of natural gas buses, and&#13;
economic and financial justification of trolleybus and tram systems. Environmental costs and&#13;
benefits are assessed and taken into consideration in the analysis. The consultants also make&#13;
recommendations on demand management, especially on how to reduce peak demand by&#13;
introducing such measures as staggered work hours.&#13;
ORGANIZATION OF TECHNICAL ASSISrANCE&#13;
12.         The technical assistance inputs require a team of individuals skilled in the&#13;
economics and financial analysis of urban public transport, and privatization of urban public&#13;
transport services. The technical assistance should be comprised of a team of experts that visit&#13;
the project cities on a rotating basis according to the particular needs of the cities in the areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.6                                                                      131&#13;
described above. One of the team should be designated as a team leader with day-to-day&#13;
responsibility for the consulting aspects of the team's performance (as well as carrying out&#13;
above-mentioned consulting activities). The team leader reports to the unit chief responsible for&#13;
Technical Assistance within the Project Implementation Directorate (PID). It is suggested the&#13;
team leader be based in Moscow.&#13;
13.         Reporting. Quarterly reports on the progress of the assignment are submitted to&#13;
the PID, including the status and content of contractual relationships between the city&#13;
governments and public transport companies, and progress with privatization of urban transport&#13;
services.&#13;
14.         TImetable. The assignment should be completed within 18 months of the date that&#13;
the contract becomes effective.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE C:&#13;
ASSISTANCE TO PROJECT CITIES FOR THE REGULATION,&#13;
FINANCING AND PRIVATIZATION OF URBAN TRANSPORT&#13;
BAcKGRouND&#13;
1.          The Russian Federation is undertaking a project (the Project) to support urban&#13;
transport reforms in a number of cities, arrest the decline in urban transport services throughout&#13;
the Federation and provide restructuring advice to the domestic bus manufacturing industry. The&#13;
total project cost estimate is US$391 million dollars equivalent and is financed by the Russian&#13;
Federation, the World Bank, the European Commission (EC) and possibly other international&#13;
donors. The Ministry of Finance is the Borrower and the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the&#13;
Implementing Agency. Funds are onlent to the project cities for new vehicles, rehabilitation of&#13;
vehicles, provision of workshop equipment and technical assistance.&#13;
2.           Current Situation and Basis for the Project. With 74 percent of its population&#13;
living in urban areas and car ownership only about 6 cars per 100 inhabitants, compared to over&#13;
40 in Western Europe, Russia is more dependent upon public transport services than any other&#13;
nation with a similar level of income. Urban transport carried 41.8 billion passengers in 1991,&#13;
representing an 85 percent share of passenger transportation by all modes, compared to 20&#13;
percent in Western Europe and 3 percent in the United States. Russia has one of the three largest&#13;
urban public transport fleets in the world, with about 105,000 buses providing regularly&#13;
scheduled urban and suburban service, but is small in terms of vehicles per population.&#13;
Moreover, the fleet is shrinking. Fast deteriorating equipment conditions, driven by&#13;
unavailability of funds to upgrade and maintain existing fleets, are resulting in out-of-service&#13;
ratios between 60 percent to 70 percent of the fleet in most cities and break-downs are as high&#13;
as 20 percent of the fleet. Low service levels are developing as a result; vehicles are&#13;
overcrowded, averaging over nine passengers per sq. m. at peak and waiting times have increased&#13;
considerably. Similar, but less severe, problems prevail with tram and trolleybus companies.&#13;
3.           The lack of funds, together with the increasing costs and declining domestic&#13;
production of buses and increased cost of imported diesel-powered buses has left public transport&#13;
companies without the means to replace its fleet and sustain operations. Low cost recovery from&#13;
fares, together with a high number of fare dodgers and fare exemptions (at least one-third of the&#13;
population and as high as 70-80 percent in some cities), and an inflationary environment have&#13;
increased urban transport companies' operating losses to an estimated Rb1.0 trillion in 1993,&#13;
roughly six percent of GDP. At the same time, as a part of the pattern of general reform,&#13;
combined with the fiscal crisis of the central Government, the responsibility for capital and&#13;
operating subsides to the urban transport industry has devolved, of necessity, and by decree, to&#13;
the local level. Local governments, which have increasing responsibilities to subsidize other&#13;
sectors as well as an often insufficient tax revenue base, have difficulty funding transport losses.&#13;
Reforms to improve cost recovery, eliminate fare exemptions and fight fare evaders are greatly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
134                                                                           Annex 5.6&#13;
needed so that a greater portion of existing subsidies can be used to finance vehicle replacement&#13;
and other capital needs. In the longer term, Russia's urban transport sector also needs access to&#13;
more fuel-efficient vehicles (about half the Russian bus fleet is gasoline rather than&#13;
diesel-powered, and is about 40 percent less fuel efficient) and to develop competitive&#13;
procurement procedures that will eventually stimulate a competitive bus manufacturing industry&#13;
within Russia that offers more energy efficient, less-polluting and longer lasting buses.&#13;
4.           During project preparation, the Bank worked with a number of cities to encourage&#13;
them to put forward urban transport reform programs. The project will assist fourteen&#13;
self-selected candidate cities which have met a minimum program of urban transport reforms,&#13;
including particularly doubling or trebling cost recovery ratios, as a condition for inclusion of&#13;
the project. The 14 cities include five of the nation's thirteen cities over one million population&#13;
and range from 116,000 (Velikie Luki) to 1.5 million people (Nizhniy Novgorod). All the cities&#13;
except Omsk are in the European part of Russia. The most stringent requirement for inclusion&#13;
has been attainment of at least a 25 percent cost recovery ratio (excluding depreciation) for the&#13;
second quarter of 1994.&#13;
5.           Main Objective of the Project. The main objective of the project is to help the&#13;
Federal Government replicate reforms and develop more effective urban transport policies&#13;
throughout the country by demonstrating the effectiveness of reforms in fourteen self-selected&#13;
cities, including increasing cost recovery, restructuring the sector, establishing autonomous&#13;
transit entities, and stimulating private participation in the sector. This objective is to be&#13;
accomplished by (a) linking financing of urgently needed replacement vehicles and spare parts&#13;
to improve vehicle availability to the implementation or reforms in fourteen cities; and&#13;
(b) strengthening urban transport institutions and improving the efficiency of passenger transport&#13;
operations. To assist cities in their efforts to improve cost recovery and to strengthen their&#13;
operations, the project includes the provision of technical assistance. The purpose of this terms&#13;
of reference is to detail the duties and responsibilities of assistance and training that are proposed&#13;
to be provided to the project city municipal authorities and urban transport entities.&#13;

TECEIcAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
8.           Objectives. A main objective of the technical assistance is to improve the&#13;
efficiency of transit operations by improving contractual relationships between the companies and&#13;
the local governments, rationalizing subsidies for urban transport, and introducing private&#13;
provision of urban transport services.&#13;
9.           Scope of Work. The consultants provide assistance to the project cities and transit&#13;
enterprises:&#13;
(a)   To improve the charters of the project companies and their contractual&#13;
relationships with the city and oblast governments.&#13;
(b)   To help implement more transparent procedures for allocation of subsidies to&#13;
urban transport companies.&#13;
(c)   To introduce private provision of urban transport services.&#13;
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CHARTERS OF THE PRoJECT COMPANIES AND THEIR CONTRACTUAL&#13;
RELATIoNsEiPs WITH THE CITY GovERNmENTs&#13;
10.         Objective. To develop charters and contracts for the project companies which&#13;
provide for autonomous companies with clearly defined relationships with the local governments,&#13;
measurement of performance, and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
136                                                                          Annex 5.6&#13;
11.         Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Review the charters of the operating companies in the project cities, as well as&#13;
the various contracts among the local governments, the companies' senior&#13;
managers, and the depot managers. Compare them with the charters and contracts&#13;
in use in successful urban transport organizations in other countries.&#13;
(b)   Develop proposed charters for each of the operating companies and discuss them&#13;
with the officials of the companies and of the local governments; the charters&#13;
clearly set forth the main responsibilities of the operating companies, the&#13;
principles under which they operate, their general organization, cost recovery&#13;
targets and financing mechanisms. In particular, the charters should ensure that&#13;
the operating companies are free to take all decisions regarding their organization,&#13;
operations, maintenance, purchase of spare parts and materials, financial&#13;
transactions, and personnel matters, or as otherwise defined by their owners, the&#13;
local governments.&#13;
(c)   Formulate detailed contracts between the local governments and the companies'&#13;
senior managers which set forth the objectives of the companies in terms of&#13;
service (particularly routes and frequencies) and efficiency, with quantitative&#13;
targets (including cost reduction and efficiency in terms of cost per revenue&#13;
passenger-kilometer and cost recovery targets) whenever possible. Develop&#13;
detailed subcontracts between the companies' senior managers and the managers&#13;
of the depots.&#13;
(d)   After review of the existing systems for subsidy allocation in the project cities&#13;
with special attention to their results in 1994, develop an urban transport subsidy&#13;
system which includes:&#13;
*     calculation of actual costs;&#13;
*     targets for improvements in cost recovery;&#13;
*     maximization of passenger yields and minimization of operating costs;&#13;
*     incorporation of incentives for transit companies to improve fare collection and&#13;
reduce costs;&#13;
*     protection of transit companies from erosion of cost recovery due to undue delays&#13;
in tariff increases;&#13;
*     procedures for regular accounting and reporting designed to ensure that subsidy&#13;
funds are expended only on urban transport in the city providing the funds;&#13;
*     coordination with improved computerized procedures for budget preparation;&#13;
*     procedures and schedules for preparation of subsidy requests and for their review&#13;
and approval by local governments in coordination with local budget approval&#13;
procedures.&#13;
(e)   Formulate a mechanism to link part of the salary of the companies' senior&#13;
managers and depot managers to the achievement of their objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.6                                                                      137&#13;
(f)   Develop procedures and schedules for reporting, regular review  of the&#13;
performance of the companies, and updating of the contracts.&#13;
(g)   Formulate recommendations for strengthening local governments so that they can&#13;
supervise the companies effectively as established in the charters and contracts.&#13;
(h)   Ensure that the proposed systems and procedures are consistent with&#13;
improvements recommended in other studies regarding budget and cost&#13;
accounting. Also ensure that the proposals are consistent with existing regulations&#13;
on the control of state-owned enterprises, as well as new regulations being&#13;
developed as part of the general technical assistance to the State Property&#13;
Committee on enterprise reform. In this context, ensure that the public transport&#13;
companies have a clear legal status (possibly that of Joint Stock Company with&#13;
the State as sole owner).&#13;
FORMULATnON AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF&#13;
URBAN PUBLC TRANSPORT SERVICES BY THE PRIVATE SECrOR&#13;
12.         Objectives. To introduce the private provision of urban transport services and to&#13;
ensure efficient competition.&#13;
13.,        Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
a)    Review existing licensing standards and procedures and compare with those used&#13;
in countries with the most efficient urban public transport services.&#13;
b)    Identify changes in the regulatory framework required to facilitate the entry of&#13;
qualified private suppliers of urban public transport services. The objective should&#13;
be that any person or company willing to provide any type of public transport&#13;
service would be authorized to do so as long as it meets national standards&#13;
regarding safety and pollution and can show the necessary minimum level of&#13;
professional capability. Recommend, in particular, improvements in&#13;
organizational arrangements and staffing so that license requests are processed&#13;
expeditiously and fairly and help Government implement these improvements.&#13;
c)    Identify public transport needs that are not being adequately met by existing&#13;
services and formulate measures to encourage entrepreneurs to provide them.&#13;
d)    Formulate a set of minimum regulations, as well as monitoring and enforcement&#13;
mechanisms, to ensure that the quality and reliability of public transport service&#13;
provided by private operators is adequate, the interests of the general urban public&#13;
are safeguarded, and efficient business practices are maintained. Liaise with&#13;
MOT's legal task force to ensure compatibility with federal legislation in this&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
138                                                                           Annex 5.6&#13;
e)    Review local regulations and procedures that may be relevant to the competitive&#13;
tender of public transport routes. Identify potential bidders and analyze their&#13;
constraints (human resources, equipment, finance, etc.) which may affect their&#13;
operations.&#13;
f)    On the basis of the experience of other countries, identify routes that could be&#13;
tendered and propose implementation measures to do so, with special emphasis&#13;
on. service standards, bidding documents and procedures, and supervision&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
g)    Help implement competitive tendering of public transport for at least two routes&#13;
in each of the project cities, and monitor the performance of the successful&#13;
bidders.&#13;
14.          Training. The consultants give seminars to the project cities on contractual&#13;
relationships of public transport companies and city governments, financing of urban transport&#13;
and privatization of urban transport services. They also arrange for study tours as detailed in the&#13;
attachment to these terms of reference.&#13;
15.          Organization of Technical Assistance. The technical assistance inputs require a&#13;
team of individuals skilled in the regulation and financing of urban public transport, and&#13;
privatization of urban public transport services. The technical assistance should be comprised&#13;
of a team of experts to visit the project cities on a rotating basis according to the particular needs&#13;
of the cities in the areas described above. One of the team should be designated as a team leader&#13;
with day-to-day responsibility for the consulting aspects of the team's performance (as well as&#13;
carrying out above-mentioned consulting activities). The team leader reports to the unit chief&#13;
responsible for Technical Assistance within the Project Implementation Directorate (PID). It is&#13;
suggested the team leader be based in Moscow.&#13;
16.         Reporting. Quarterly reports on the progress of the assignment to be submitted&#13;
to the PID, including the status and content of contractual relationships between the city&#13;
governments and public transport companies, and progress with privatization of urban transport&#13;
services.&#13;
17.          Timetable. The assignment should be completed within two years of the date that&#13;
the contract becomes effective.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 5.6                                                                         139&#13;
Attachment to C&#13;
STUDY TouRs&#13;
Objective. Study tours will be carried out to inform central and local government&#13;
officials and managers of urban transport companies of the lessons of experience and modem&#13;
practices in the regulation, financing and privatization of urban transport and formulate&#13;
recommendations on how to implement such practices in Russia.&#13;
2.           Main Tasks. These include:&#13;
(a)   Study trips&#13;
(i)    The consultants will organize a program of visits and seminars for two&#13;
groups of about 15 persons each to two European cities. The cities and the&#13;
public transport companies to be visited will be selected for the efficiency&#13;
of their transport systems and the development of contractual relations&#13;
with public transport companies and privatization of urban transport&#13;
services. The two cities are in different countries. One is of a size of at&#13;
least one million population. The main urban transport modes are urban&#13;
buses, trolleybuses, and trams.&#13;
(ii)   The focus of the study tours is to:&#13;
-     Roles of central and local governments in urban transport.&#13;
-     Governance of public transport enterprises, contractual relationships&#13;
between the companies and the government, performance assessment.&#13;
-     Tariff and  subsidy  policies,  their  implementation  as  part of&#13;
government/enterprise contractual relationships.&#13;
*     Actual and potential role of the private sector, innovative approaches and&#13;
their implementation.&#13;
*     Alternative means of introducing privatization of public transport services,&#13;
including contracting out routes.&#13;
(iii) The study tours include well prepared presentations with extensive use of&#13;
audiovisual and distribution of written materials in Russian. Although only&#13;
two cities are visited for practical reasons, interesting solutions developed&#13;
in other cities are also to be presented in seminars given by the&#13;
consultants.&#13;
The Project Implementation Directorate will assist with the organization of the study tours.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5.8&#13;
THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTORATE&#13;
1.          Background. To prepare, implement and coordinate the Urban Transport Project,&#13;
MOT has established the Project Implementation Directorate (PID) as an entity within the&#13;
Department of Automobile Transport by Order No. 14 dated August 4, 1994, and following&#13;
regulations contained in that order. The unit is staffed by staff delegated from MOT and is&#13;
headed by a Project Director (PD), assisted by staff as shown in Chart 1 of Annex 5.10. The&#13;
PD reports to the Urban Transport Project Coordinating Council (the Council) which comprises&#13;
representatives of the project cities and MOT. The Council is chaired by a representative of&#13;
MOT. The Deputy Chairpersons are drawn from the cities on a rotating basis or elected by city&#13;
representatives (Annex 5.10, Chart 2).&#13;
2.          The PID is also assisted by two consulting services under separate Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR): (a) a Project Advisor (PA); and (b) a procurement services firm. Both&#13;
services are provided by consulting firms and are financed under the Project. The PID is&#13;
provided with suitable office space and communication and office equipment.&#13;
3.          PID Functions. Under the direction of the Committee, the PID is the focal point&#13;
for the project, is responsible for its successful execution, and has undertaken supervision of the&#13;
project. It acts as a service agency and agent to the cities, for those components to be procured&#13;
by the cities, and directly for those project components which are directly the responsibility of&#13;
the MOT. The PID functions are listed below and should be read in conjunction with the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, Disbursement Handbook and Guidelines for Financial Reporting and&#13;
Auditing:&#13;
(a)   coordination with and between cities;&#13;
(b)   liaison with other donors and the World Bank;&#13;
(c)   procurement of major items;&#13;
(d)   administration of the national spare parts program;&#13;
(e)   engaging and supervising the project technical assistance assignments;&#13;
(f)   procurement training;&#13;
(g)   disbursement activities;&#13;
(h)   monitoring, accounting and auditing;&#13;
1. The term 'city' used throughout these TOR covers also the city transport companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144                                                                          Annex 5.8&#13;
(i)   reporting; and&#13;
(.i) policies concerning the above.&#13;
4.           Coordination. The PID is the means and forum for coordination between cities.&#13;
This includes coordinating and assisting the cities' preparation and implementation activities&#13;
including agreement on each city's needs, the cities' project implementation organizations, the&#13;
financial arrangements, the execution schedules and the documents required for procurement.&#13;
The PID coordinates achieving the level of consistency required for successful project&#13;
implementation. The degree of consistency varies according to the project activity, e.g.,&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) documents and procedures are standard for all ICB&#13;
procurement; project related computer applications should be identical; however, city&#13;
implementation arrangements may vary according to existing city organizational structures. The&#13;
PID has issued project preparation and implementation guidelines and, with each city, assists in&#13;
the drawing up a project preparation and implementation plan and schedule with responsibilities&#13;
clearly defined. The plan and schedule form the basis of project monitoring and reporting for&#13;
each city. The PID arranges and coordinates meeting between city officials and issues&#13;
information to cities on a regular basis on project activities. The PID also coordinates project&#13;
related MOF and MOT activities.&#13;
5.          Liaison. The PID provides liaison with donors, the MOF and other concerned&#13;
ministries, other public entities and the World Bank. In this regard, the PID is the consolidated&#13;
repository for project information and data which it makes available to concerned entities in&#13;
appropriate formats.&#13;
6.           Procurement. Using the Procurement Services Firm, the PID has general&#13;
responsibility for the administration of the procurement of equipment, goods and services. It acts&#13;
as a procurement agent for the cities and is delegated powers in this regard by the cities for city&#13;
procurement. In undertaking procurement of equipment and goods, the PID follows the World&#13;
Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and, for selecting and&#13;
employing professional services, follows the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency. The PID also is familiar with and&#13;
follows the procurement provisions of the Loan Agreement. The PID is responsible for&#13;
organizing authorized prebid conferences and for arranging for preshipment and post delivery&#13;
inspections. The PID also coordinates with the cities and MOT in collecting documentation such&#13;
as inspection certificates, certificates of origin/manufacturer, manufacturers'/suppliers'&#13;
guarantees, bills of lading, insurance certificates and is responsible for arranging for arranging&#13;
for or facilitating clearance through customs. The specific responsibilities and arrangements for&#13;
procurement are as follows;&#13;
(i)    Provision of 1,501 new buses and 272 trolleybuses with spare parts&#13;
As the end user and owner of the buses and trolleybuses are the cities, the role&#13;
of the PID is to undertake the procurement on behalf of and with the full&#13;
participation of these cities. Procurement follows ICB procedures using the World&#13;
Bank's standard documentation. Using the coordination approach outlined above,&#13;
the PID is responsible for producing the final draft of the bidding documents and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex S.8                                                                          145&#13;
agreeing these with the cities prior to their being submitted to the Bank for its&#13;
comments and/or "no objections". An evaluation commission will be set up to&#13;
receive and evaluate the bids. The role of the PID (and its advisers) and the PD&#13;
will be to act as the technical resource and secretariat to this commission. The&#13;
commission will comprise staff of MOT and cities with the majority being drawn&#13;
from city staff. From among its members, the commission will choose its own&#13;
chairman (who should not be a member of the PID). After receipt of bids by the&#13;
commission, the PID will assist the commission with its evaluation: and making&#13;
recommendations to the Council accompanied by detailed evaluation reports.&#13;
After review and discussion, the Council will forward the recommended award(s)&#13;
to the Bank. Contracts will be signed by the PID acting as agent under the written&#13;
authority of the cities.&#13;
(il)   Rehabilitation of 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses and 380 trams&#13;
Procurement for the rehabilitation program will comprise: (a) the procurement of&#13;
spare parts and (b) contracting out of vehicle rehabilitation work.&#13;
Procurement. Procurement for the rehabilitation will comprise (a) contracting out&#13;
rehabilitation work - first initial urgent work under International Shopping&#13;
followed by Limited International Bidding for the bulk of the work: (b)&#13;
procurement of spare parts for in-house rehabilitation (see Section G, Chapter V&#13;
of the SAR for details). Most of the procurement will be undertaken by the cities&#13;
themselves with contracts signed by the cities.&#13;
Training, Advice and Assistance. The role of the PID will be to provide&#13;
procurement training and advice to the cities. For this, the PID will rely largely&#13;
on two of its consulting services: (i) the Procurement Services firm; and (ii) the&#13;
Vehicle Rehabilitation Technical Assistance. The assistance will include the&#13;
development of eommon specifications and contract documents suitable for&#13;
rehabilitation work and acceptable to the World Bank for use under Limited&#13;
International Bidding and International Shopping procedures.&#13;
Selection of Vehicles and Procurement Methods. Through the above consulting&#13;
services, each city will confirm and/or revise the list of vehicles to be&#13;
rehabilitated in the first year and agree on whether these should be rehabilitated&#13;
by contract or in-house.&#13;
Rehabilitation Assistance. During the implementation of the rehabilitation&#13;
program, the PID will oversee the vehicle rehabilitation assistance consultants&#13;
work, including the advice and assistance on preparation for, and ongoing, in-&#13;
house rehabilitation work, and setting up appropriate inspection arrangements for&#13;
rehabilitation by contract.&#13;

(iii) National Spare Parts Program&#13;
Under the Order creating the PID, on behalf of MOT, the PID will be responsible&#13;
for procuring the spare parts. The PID will consolidate the lists of spares and&#13;
prepare specifications. Spares should be combined in packages with ICB being&#13;
used for all packages. For all ICB procurement, the PID will be responsible to&#13;
an MOT National Spare Parts Program evaluation committee which will set PID&#13;
procedures for the Program and make award recommendations. Contracts will be&#13;
signed by the MOT.&#13;
(iv)   Workshop and Computer Equipment&#13;
The responsibilities and arrangements will generally follow 6(i) above. Working&#13;
with the cities, the PID will be responsible for the preparation of draft&#13;
specifications to be agreed by the cities prior to invitation of bids. Contracts will&#13;
be signed on an agency basis by the PID.&#13;
(v)   Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
There are seven assignments to be provided by consulting services to be managed&#13;
by the Technical Assistance Unit. These are:&#13;
(a)   the PA;&#13;
(b)   procurement services including inspection services;&#13;
(c)   technical assistance to the cities;&#13;
(d)   bus manufacturing studies and advice;&#13;
(e)   urban transport policy advice;&#13;
(f)   preparation of a second urban transport project; and&#13;
(g)   study tours/training&#13;
The PID will be responsible for the contracting of consulting services. Cities will take&#13;
part in the selection process for assignments which will involve their cities. Selection and&#13;
employment of consultants will follow the Bank's Guidelines and the Loan Agreement&#13;

of the use of all funds by components and categories of equipment and goods&#13;
procured and consultants employed and paid under the project. The accounting&#13;
system should reflect the movement and receipts and payments through the&#13;
Special Account with balances agreed with monthly financial statements from the&#13;
holding commercial bank and with periodic statements from the World Bank.&#13;
(e)   An auditing system to meet the requirements of the Government of the Russian&#13;
Federation and the World Bank with the PID audited in accordance with&#13;
International Accounting Guidelines by an auditor retained by the MOF and&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

noted in para 7 and submitted to the World Bank;&#13;
(ii)   Semi-annual progress reports in a format to be agreed with the World Bank&#13;
covering all project components and based on the information systems indicated&#13;
in para 7 above. These reports will include: (a) progress achieved against agreed&#13;
implementation and disbursement schedules, including number of contracts for&#13;
goods and vehicle rehabilitation works awarded, number of buses and quantity of&#13;
spare parts delivered, number of urban transport vehicles rehabilitated, and&#13;
project monitorable targets and perfdrmance indicators, and (b) work programs&#13;

ANNEX 5.16&#13;
DETAILS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
RussIA's INST1TUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWoRK FOR THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.          Background. Prior to 1988, the FSU  had no central administrative and&#13;
management bodies involved in environmental protection; and a number of ministries and&#13;
departments performed different management and monitoring functions in natural resources&#13;
conservation and environmental protection, including the USSR State Agro-industrial Committee,&#13;
State Forestry Committee, USSR Ministry of Water Management and Reclamation, USSR&#13;
Ministry of Fishing Industry, USSR State Committee of Hydrometeorology and Environmental&#13;
Monitoring, USSR Ministry of Public Health, USSR Ministry of Geology, USSR State Mining&#13;
Safety Inspectorate, and USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These ministries and departments&#13;
often operated as powerful monopolies, ignoring environmental concerns and the interests of&#13;
local populations, as the centrally set production targets served as the primary incentives. In&#13;
early 1990, under the pressure of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost and perestroika a new federal&#13;
agency responsible for the environmental protection was created in the USSR (Goskompriroda).&#13;
2.          Ministry of Environment. In Russia, the recently renamed Ministry of&#13;
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR) is, in many ways, similar to that of&#13;
the previous the USSR Goskompiroda. MEPNR is the central governmental organ responsible&#13;
for environmental protection and natural resource utilization in Russia, in conjunction with the&#13;
executive authorities of the legal subjects of the Russian Federation. Its functions include&#13;
regulation of land utilization and conservation, and the use of surface and ground water, air,&#13;
vegetation, wildlife, and natural resources, including those of the territorial waters, the&#13;
continental shelf, and the exclusive economic zone. Within the Russian Federation, the&#13;
govemments of the subjects of the Russian Federation (Oblasts, Republics) have received greater&#13;
powers in formulating policy, including environmental policy. At the same time, the earlier&#13;
system of ministries and state committees charged with environmental responsibilities essentially&#13;
remains. In the case of the transport sector, the Ministry of Transport of the RF is responsible&#13;
for the development and submission to MEPNR of the sectoral environmental programs,&#13;
designing techniques of transport-specific environmental monitoring and drafting ecological&#13;
standards and regulations to be cleared and approved of by MEPNR. Due to rapid, ongoing&#13;
1.    This section was written using the data from: The World Bank, Europe and Central Asia (EC3lV), Environwntal&#13;
Management Project Staff Appraisal Report, Wash., DC, August 1994; and Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation,&#13;
Natonal Report on the Environmental Impact of Transport Sector, Moscow, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
198                                                                       Annex 5.16&#13;
changes in the Russian system of government, the institutional framework for environmental&#13;
protection is still evolving and devolving to lower levels in the government structure.&#13;
3.          Territorial (oblast, rayon, or city) bodies of the MEPNR work with executive&#13;
authorities and industries to achieve standards, conduct inspections and assess fines. The&#13;
territorial bodies of MEPNR are empowered to carry out inspections for local environmental&#13;
protection and elaboration of environmental programs in their areas, accounting and assessing&#13;
of natural resources, volumes of production, waste accumulation, and pollution. They are also&#13;
responsible for State Environmental Impact Assessment Review of projects and for issuing of&#13;
permits, making decisions on restriction, suspension and cessation of environmentally harmful&#13;
activities, settlement of disputes, protection of natural monuments and protected areas, ecological&#13;
training and education, and information dissemination.&#13;
4.          Environmental Legislation in Russia. In formal terms, the conservation and&#13;
rational use of natural resources were constitutionally guaranteed in the FSU. Principal laws and&#13;
codes, such as "On Air Protection" (1960), "Land Code" (1970), "Code on Mineral Resources"&#13;
(1976), "Water Code' (1972), and "Fundamentals of the Russian Federation On Forestry"&#13;
(1977) were adopted. Major shifts in Soviet environmental policy occurred in 1986 and 1988,&#13;
when efforts were increased to rationalize the use of natural resources and protect the&#13;
environment. Incentives for decreasing material and energy inputs per unit of output were&#13;
introduced. While economic imperatives were the primary driving force behind the new policy,&#13;
the growing costs to the environment were also increasingly being appreciated.&#13;
5.          The USSR "Law on the State Enterprises" (passed in 1987) had special value in&#13;
this regard, by containing legal provisions for taking account of environmental impacts. This law&#13;
contained the first preventive measures aimed at curbing pollution and limiting excessive and&#13;
wasteful extraction and production methods in the former Soviet Union. Its Articles 17 and 20&#13;
specifically referred to environmental aspects, such as payments for the use of natural resources,&#13;
environmental protection measures, and compensation for environmental damage (to be paid&#13;
from the enterprises' own budgets). Introduction of cleaner technologies became mandatory for&#13;
certain types of production. The law was founded on the premise that state enterprises should&#13;
and could become self-financing and profit-making entities, with a stake in their own&#13;
profitability. However, it proved difficult to implement the new policy, to some extent because&#13;
the efforts to realize enterprise self-financing faltered. These difficulties are even more&#13;
pronounced with respect to deficit-ridden urban passenger transport companies and some other&#13;
heavily subsidized transport subsectors.&#13;
6.          The 1991 Russian Federation "Law on Environmental Protection" sets out the&#13;
areas of responsibility of the various levels of government within the country. The federal&#13;
government, for example, is tasked with establishing environmental standards and procedures&#13;
for setting fees for natural resources use. Governments at the republic level set fees and issue&#13;
licenses for natural resource use. Regional (krai and oblast) administrations issue permits for&#13;
pollution emissions. Regional and local MEPNR agencies (upravleniya Minprirody) are&#13;
responsible for monitoring emissions; and republic- and regional-level agents enforce compliance&#13;
with federal standards. In case of transport air pollution, the relevant motor vehicle certification&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.16                                                                     199&#13;
is done by the Russian Transport Inspectorates - local units of MOT, with enforcement by the&#13;
Ministry of Interior branch - road police, or State Automobile Inspection (GAI).&#13;
FEDERAL PoLIcIEs AND MECHANISMS OF TRANSPORT POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
7.          Possible approaches towards the containment of the negative effects transport has&#13;
on the environment are:&#13;
*     State certification of automotive vehicles to ensure compliance with standard&#13;
levels of permissible emissions;&#13;
*     Licensing of transport enterprises;&#13;
*     Economic incentives (vehicle and fuel taxation, etc.);&#13;
*     Higher effectiveness of the utilization of fleet, minimization of per unit costs and&#13;
optimization of public transport route networks; and&#13;
*     Optimization of city traffic patterns (bus and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes) and&#13;
urban planning.&#13;
8.          Air Quality Management Programs. Such programs in Russia are in general more&#13;
biased toward control of stationary sources of pollution. Oversight of the process is provided&#13;
centrally by MEPNR and responsibilities for implementation of the system are delegated to the&#13;
oblasts, rayons, and municipalities. Since 60% of the pollution fee revenue is kept by the local&#13;
Committees of Environmental Protection, their role in air quality management is very strong and&#13;
they appear to operate with considerable autonomy. On the other hand, the providers of transport&#13;
services, i.e., entities that own and/or operate non-stationary sources of air pollution, are&#13;
nominally regulated through economic levers of fuel tax and vehicle tax and though promulgation&#13;
of vehicle technical specifications related to permissible emissions. However, such measures&#13;
have little impact on urban passenger transport companies because: (a) any imposed penalties&#13;
and fees for environmental pollution are dwarfed by the rapidly increasing operating costs of&#13;
transport companies (e.g., environmental fees equaled 0.02% of one of the project companies'&#13;
total expenses in the 1st quarter of 1994); and (b) since last year (1993) public passenger&#13;
transport providers were federally declared exempt of the normative pollution fees. On the other&#13;
hand, the rapidly increasing cost of fuel serves as a natural economic incentive for companies&#13;
to purchase, over time, more fuel-efficient and hence less polluting engines. This trend is slowed&#13;
only by the inability of transit companies to finance vehicle replacement with higher quality&#13;
ones.&#13;
9.          Russia's Air Quality Management program  currently is too complex and&#13;
cumbersome to enable sources to react to changes in marketplace. It needs to be simplified and&#13;
streamlined so that sources can adapt to changing markets and attempt innovative modifications&#13;
to products and production methods. Industrial enterprises could then attain the norms in their&#13;
most cost-effective manner. The system also needs to be able to deal effectively with&#13;
uncooperative managers of industrial concerns.&#13;
10.         There are several specific aspects of the Russian AQM system that should be&#13;
improved if the system is to work efficiently and be more cost effective. These are: (a) reduce&#13;
the large number of pollutants (over 1,000) for which norms have been developed; (b) simplify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
200                                                                       Annex 5.16&#13;
the synergy concept that attempts to consider the combined effect of pollutants on health;&#13;
(c) establish a de minimis concept for regulating emissions or making process changes;&#13;
(d) modify the legal system to facilitate enforcement of the control strategies and provide for&#13;
redress by the regulator, sources or citizens; (e) update the outmoded technology used for&#13;
ambient and source measurements and the data systems in which measurement information are&#13;
stored; (f) refocus the current system to enable Russian regulators to manage the collective&#13;
impacts of all of the sources in an area; and (g) address the transport of pollutants into&#13;
neighboring countries and global air issues.&#13;
HUMAN  AND  TECENCAL  CAPACITIES  AND  CONSTRAINS  FOR  ENviRoNMENTALLY&#13;
SUSTAINABLE MOTOR TRANSPORT SECTOR IN RUSSIA&#13;
11.         The current environmental quality management system at all levels of government&#13;
is in a state restructuring and adaptation to the new economic and political realities in Russia.&#13;
Key issues that need to be addressed during the transition to a more effective system of&#13;
environmental management for pollution abatement and nature protection that can meet the&#13;
special demands of a new economic, political and social system include: (a) unreliability of the&#13;
data; (b) ineffectiveness of the legal and regulatory system; (c) poorly defined management and&#13;
organizational responsibilities; (d) inadequate budgetary allocations; (e) breakdown of the&#13;
command and control system and deficiencies in the economic incentive structure for pollution&#13;
abatement and nature protection; (f) deficiencies in the methodologies and techniques used to&#13;
derive emission limits for air and water quality management and management of solid and&#13;
hazardous wastes, including the ambient environmental quality standards that have been adopted;&#13;
and (g) insufficient financial incentives and resources for companies to invest in environmental&#13;
mitigation efforts.&#13;
12.         Unreliability of environmental data. The old system of central planning and&#13;
control has left a legacy of inefficiency and mismanagement resulting from: unreliable basic&#13;
information; narrow segregation of responsibility; poor information dissemination and analysis;&#13;
incomplete accountability for performance or results; and, in certain cases, deliberate&#13;
misreporting of environmental data. In some cases Bank missions have found that the data&#13;
provided was in considerable error (e.g., by factors of 2 to 5 times). In many situations it is&#13;
simply impossible to judge by how much the data are in error. Due to insufficient budgets and&#13;
lack of staff, the air and water inspectorate in the MEPNR and its committees at oblast and local&#13;
levels have to rely on the industrial enterprises and municipal sewage organizations to provide&#13;
data on pollution emissions from their facilities. In short, the current situation is such that no&#13;
data generated by the system can be taken at face value. Since the generation of reliable&#13;
environmental information and its timely dissemination and effective analysis are fundamental&#13;
to eIfficient environmental management, this is clearly a priority area for upgrading and&#13;
improvement in any strategy for assistance to this sector.&#13;
13.         Ineffective environmentalprotection laws and regulations. Another important issue&#13;
that adversely affects the ability of MEPNR and its territorial branches to perform their&#13;
regulatory functions is the state of development of the legal system in the FSU. Environmental&#13;
law was slow to develop and environmental lawyers and law schools teaching environmental law&#13;
are, therefore, rare in Russia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.16                                                                   201&#13;
14.         Poorly defined management and organizational responsibilities. Responsibilities&#13;
for environmental quality management are dispersed among many governmental agencies. For&#13;
example, MOT has a Division of Science and Technology within the Office of the Minister, and&#13;
all the federal-level environmental issues are supposed to be covered by a 5-member Subdivision&#13;
of Transport Environmental and Safety Regulations. But it fact, the Ministry, for the lacks of&#13;
resources, seconds this responsibility to a similarly named division in the Research Institute of&#13;
Automobile Transport (NIIAT). Virtually the same programmatic work is also done at a&#13;
subdivision of MEPNR. These efforts are poorly coordinated leading to conflicts between the&#13;
ministries and inefficient use of the limited human and financial resources available. The&#13;
MEPNR is one of the more recently formed governmental organizations, and has had great&#13;
difficulty establishing its own leadership role in environmental management.&#13;
15.         Inadequate budget allocations. Even before the break-up of the FSU, the financial&#13;
resources available for environmental quality management were extremely limited. Some relief&#13;
was provided with the introduction of the pollution fee system and allocation of a proportion of&#13;
these funds to support environmental regulatory activities. However, the downturn in the&#13;
economy, the pressing social demands on limited government funds, and the effects of inflation&#13;
have greatly eroded these small gains. As a result the environmental management system is&#13;
under severe financial stress. There is a danger that well-trained and experienced personnel in&#13;
pollution abatement and nature protection will seek other occupations in order to survive the&#13;
current economic crisis.&#13;
16.         Inappropriate criteria for emission standards. Recently, a number of the current&#13;
ambient emissions standards in Russia for air, water and soil quality, are quite advanced by&#13;
international standards (e.g., UN/ECE vehicle emission regulations that were made compulsory&#13;
for all motor vehicles to be manufactured in Russia after 1994). Most industries in the Russian&#13;
Federation do not currently have the capacity to be able to comply and thereby call into question&#13;
the credibility of environmental policy. According to Bank missions, the methodologies and&#13;
techniques used to set emission limits also are out of date, and lead to inefficient and ineffective&#13;
pollution abatement and control mechanisms. The problems are further compounded by the lack&#13;
of EIA requirements in respect of investment projects. The assistance to be provided by the&#13;
technical assistance teams should aim to improve the methodologies.&#13;
17.         Inadequate medium term investmentfunds. Transport enterprises are facing great&#13;
pressure to restructure their operations at a time when their financial resources are being cut&#13;
through lower government subsidies and soft credits. At the same time, the commercial banks&#13;
are reluctant to provide medium-term project investment financing due to a shortage of such&#13;
funds and political risk factors. The Bank's Environment Management Project (Loan 3806-RU)&#13;
provides a source of medium term loan funds to enterprises so that they can implement pollution&#13;
mitigation measures.&#13;
GoVERNm    T's OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY&#13;
18.         Central and regional government officials are aware of the issues raised above,&#13;
but a clear and viable policy and strategy for dealing with continual decline in environmental&#13;
management for pollution abatement and nature protection are being realized very slowly. For&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
202                                                                       Annex 5.16&#13;
instance, a list of some forty laws and regulations currently being drafted by MEPNR are not&#13;
necessarily of high priority and yet tie up the services of the very few environmental protection&#13;
law specialists employed by MEPNR. MEPNR and other government agencies with overlapping&#13;
environmental responsibilities have been the subject of several reorganizations that have not fully&#13;
resolved the issue.&#13;
19.         The one relatively clear government strategy that offers scope for interventions&#13;
with considerable likelihood of immediate success is that of devolution of administrative and&#13;
legislative powers to regional and local governments. Since local residents are becoming&#13;
increasingly vocal in their opposition to facilities that contaminate the environment, there is&#13;
increasing pressures on these local and regional governments to find solutions to environmental&#13;
problems. Unfortunately the same is not true of nature protection. Local pressures for economic&#13;
development tend to minimize the social value of protecting nature, focusing instead on the&#13;
potential economic value of the natural resources found in them. However, there are beginning&#13;
to be more opportunities in Russia for satisfying regional goals in both nature protection and&#13;
economic growth, through sustainable and environmentally acceptable development options (such&#13;
as in forestry and agriculture).&#13;
20.         Another important recent government policy initiative has been the introduction&#13;
of pollution fee system for industrial, agricultural and domestic discharges into air and water and&#13;
onto land. These fees are paid into environmental funds at the local, regional and federal level&#13;
for investments in pollution control, and to a lesser extent for research and for environmental&#13;
management purposes. While there are a number of improvements which need to be made in&#13;
relation to the level of fees assessed and in the efficiency of collection and utilization, there is&#13;
already a sound basis for an environmental economic incentive system in the Russian Federation.&#13;
21.         The severe budget constraints being faced by government agencies and enterprises&#13;
alike are severely restricting their ability to address even the most urgent environmental quality&#13;
and natural resource depletion problems. Much scope, therefore, exists for short to medium term&#13;
strategic support from multilateral and bilateral financial sources to assist the Government in&#13;
dealing with these concerns.&#13;

allow for reliable data projections and cross-checks.&#13;

            The Urban Transport Project will: 1)
            preserve essential urban transport capacity in 14 cities by
            linking financing of urgently needed replacement vehicles
            and spare parts to the implementation of reforms; 2)
            strengthen the 14 project cities' urban transport
            sector institutions so as to improve the efficiency of
            passenger transport operations; 3) arrest the decline of
            urban transport services in cities throughout Russia through
            the provision of urgently needed spare parts for transport
            vehicles; and 4) provide restructuring advice for the
            doemstic bus industry. The project will also serve to
            demonstrate the benefits of such reform programs to other
            cities in Russia and how Government support for capital
            replacement of vehicles could be tied to improved cost
            recovery and other reforms. Such reforms are needed on a
            national level to reduce urban transport losses. The project
            comprises three major components. The first component
            provides assistance for 14 self-selected cities to finance a
            large part of required fleet replacements for a three year
            period including financing for diesel fueled buses and
            trolleybuses, and rehabilitation of buses, trolley buses and
            trams; provision of workshop, computers and other equipment
            for urban transit companies plus a fare collection system to
            be tested in one of the project cities; and technical
            assistance and training to assist the cities implement
            reforms and assist with procurement and monitoring of the
            project. The second component provides assistance for the
            Ministry of Transportation (MOT) including: ten natural gas
            fueled buses; equipment for the Project Implementation
            Directorate (PID) studies of, and restructuring advice for,
            the domestic bus manufacturing industry; technical
            assistance and training to assist MOT develop more
            appropriate urban transport policies for cities throughout
            Russia; and help expand the reform program to other cities.
            The last component provides for the provision of spare parts
            for transit companies throughout Russia.
