&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Protect water now - donâ&#128;&#153;t let it run out   Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
In Peru, water scarcity is not very apparent as yet. Despite the fact that we have 5 per-&#13;
cent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s surface water, there are indicators that the drinking water produced&#13;
is wasted, a situation that is worsening with the progressive increase in our countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
population and the resulting use of the resource.&#13;
&#13;
It is estimated that by the year 2025 the population will grow to 35.5 million and the&#13;
per capita availability of annual renewable fresh water will be 1,090 cubic meters, which&#13;
means that Peru will suffer from water stress. Given this situation, it is vital that key&#13;
sectors of the population come together to promote the responsible use of water, as well&#13;
as the care and correct use of water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
It is this motivation that led to the forging of the alliance between Grupo Agua and&#13;
Grupo RPP, which gave birth to a national campaign to promote a â&#128;&#156;Culture of Waterâ&#128;?:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Protect water now, donâ&#128;&#153;t let it run out,â&#128;? whose main objective is to sensitize, inform,&#13;
and educate people on the importance of water in the lives of people.&#13;
&#13;
The outcome of this extensive campaign is being made available to the authorities and&#13;
professionals in the sector, journalists, and the general public through this publication.&#13;
We hope that this experience will lead to the forging of new strategic alliances for the&#13;
care and conservation of water in Peru.&#13;
&#13;
We thank the Grupo Agua and Grupo RPPâ&#128;&#153;s teams for their substantial contribution&#13;
to this initiative and to all those who have made the publication and distribution of&#13;
the results of the study possible.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The baseline drew from the following 10 key ideas, around         Approach&#13;
     which the campaign was designed:                                  Using both the baseline, as well as the experience of the&#13;
        1.	 30% of the respondents did not know what â&#128;&#156;potable          campaign partners as a reference, it was decided that this&#13;
            waterâ&#128;? meant and were unaware that the water we            phase would be executed on the basis of two complementary&#13;
            drink needs to be treated in order to safeguard peopleâ&#128;&#153;s   approaches. Water as:&#13;
            health.                                                       â&#128;¢	 A scarce natural resource&#13;
        2.	 Listeners were not aware of the shortage of water in          â&#128;¢	 A service that required prior processing before reaching&#13;
            Peru. People needed to understand that the problem               peopleâ&#128;&#153;s homes.&#13;
            was serious, but also that they could and had to do&#13;
            something about it.                                        These approaches were further sub-divided into the topics&#13;
        3.	 It was a fairly commonly held belief that natural water    listed in table 1.&#13;
            was always pure.&#13;
        4.	 43.6% believed that they were paying a lot or too          Table 1: APPROACHES AND THEMES&#13;
            much for water and sanitation services.                        Water as a resource             Water as a service&#13;
        5.	 The campaign had to target those availing of drinking          Availability                    Wastage and Saving&#13;
            water services and needed to highlight the individual&#13;
                                                                           Contamination of sources        Quality and Health&#13;
            as well as collective benefits of water conservation.&#13;
        6.	 To value the services provided, it was recommended             Scarcity                        Management&#13;
            that cases of areas with no drinking water had to be           Value                           Cost&#13;
            presented.&#13;

        7.	 People knew how to conserve water and 66.4% of&#13;
            those surveyed thought that people like them could&#13;
            do something to prevent water contamination.               Communication Strategies&#13;
        8.	 62.8% of the cases mentioned specific water                The first phase of the campaign used three complementary&#13;
            conservation related behavior; therefore one of the        strategies: (a) content production both for the radio as well as&#13;
            campaignâ&#128;&#153;s objectives had to be that of articulating       RPP Noticiasâ&#128;&#153; web page, (b) capacity building of journalists&#13;
            this knowledge through concrete actions.                   and (c) school competitions.&#13;
        9.	 The majority considered that water was everyoneâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
            right. However people were not aware of what               (a)	Content Production&#13;
            could be done to increase coverage. At the end of          	 Radio:&#13;
            the day, according to them, it was the authoritiesâ&#128;&#153;        	 This phase of the campaign included two types of products&#13;
            responsibility and not that of citizens.                       for the radio: advertisements and spots. 10 advertisements,&#13;
        10.	In fact, the shortage of drinking water was attributed         with durations of between 12 to 30 seconds, which were&#13;
            to the authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; lack of efficiency.                        aired 2,400 times, from Monday to Friday between 6am&#13;
                                                                           and 10pm, were produced.&#13;

         greater allocation of financial resources. For example,                                        achieving objectives of this nature or other portfolios&#13;
         given estimated market costs, a sum of US$ 230,000 â&#128;&#147;                                           related to the issue should be examined.&#13;
         similar to the average amount allocated by Grupo Agua&#13;
         in one phase of the campaign â&#128;&#147; would only be able to                                       2.	 Involvement of the business sector:&#13;
         fund a maximum of three weeks of broadcasting messages                                         â&#128;¢	 Consider the involvement of socially responsible private&#13;
         in mixed media, including over-the-air TV channels and                                            companies in water management. For this, among others,&#13;
         radio broadcasters.                                                                               mechanisms for assessing and incentivizing different&#13;

&amp;#12;Protect water now - donâ&#128;&#153;t let it run out   Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Consider the active involvement of companies in the&#13;
       sector, such as SEDAPAL, which could play a key role&#13;
       in achieving the campaignâ&#128;&#153;s objectives by incorporating&#13;
       the campaign messages on their payment receipts, to&#13;
       promote a better Culture of Water, using different&#13;
       formats.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Assessment&#13;
1.	 The monitoring and assessment process can be taken&#13;
    to the next level, implementing (besides the methods&#13;
    used) a quasi-experimental design to measure the effects&#13;
    attributable to the campaign. In simple terms, this would&#13;
    entail complementing the qualitative and quantitative&#13;
    information collected through group dynamics and&#13;
    surveys, with a city-wise sample of homes in which water&#13;
    consumption will be measured.&#13;
&#13;
2.	 Additionally, it would be important to incorporate&#13;
    water users who are not frequent RPP listeners in these&#13;
    measurements, in order to compare their consumption&#13;
    levels with those of frequent listeners. If the support of&#13;
    local water suppliers is obtained, this would not call for&#13;
    any additional resources.&#13;
&#13;
3.	 Another factor that would enhance the campaignâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    monitoring and assessment would be the organization of&#13;
    focus groups as soon as the quantitative results are out.&#13;
    This would not only help understand the information&#13;
    better, but would also provide the campaign with&#13;
    statements and beliefs to be reinforced or countered&#13;
    through future communication material.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In Peru, water scarcity is not very
            apparent as yet. Despite the fact that author have five
            percent of the world's surface water, there are
            indicators that the drinking water produced is wasted, a
            situation that is worsening with the progressive increase in
            our country's population and the resulting use of the
            resource. The outcome of this extensive campaign is being
            made available to the authorities and professionals in the
            sector, journalists, and the general public through this
            publication. Author hoped that this experience will lead to
            the forging of new strategic alliances for the care and
            conservation of water in Peru. The general objective of the
            campaign 'protect water now, don't let it run
            out' was to sensitize, inform, and educate the public
            on the importance of water in the lives of people. In the 94
            weeks that it was on air, it reached an average of six
            million listeners per week in Peru. The main message of the
            campaign warns about water scarcity, highlights how
            important it is for health, and exhorts people to take care
            of it. All the campaign's monitoring and assessment
            components combined quantitative and qualitative social
            research methods. The idea behind the baseline, in
            particular, was to contribute to the campaign's design
            to enable the main target population's understanding,
            assessment of the perceptions and opinions to be refined.
