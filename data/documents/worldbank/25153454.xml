&#13;
&#13;
I t is my pleasure to present the 12th Edition of the Kenya Economic Update. The economic environment&#13;
  in 2015 which begun on a favorable footing is turning out to be challenging. With the Fed at the cusp of&#13;
changing its monetary stance, there is uncertainty in global financial markets. This has weakened global&#13;
currencies and capital flows to emerging markets are being affected. These global developments are also&#13;
being felt in Kenya. In the past, Kenya has managed economic shocks well. If Kenya succeeds in overcoming&#13;
its ongoing economic challenges, including the crisis emanating from China, the government will be in a&#13;
position to begin delivering the promise of a more prosperous future. Already, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is expected&#13;
to be among the best performers in Sub-Sahara Africa and low middle income countries.&#13;
&#13;
This Economic Update (KEU edition 12) has four main messages. First, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance&#13;
remains solid, underpinned by strong infrastructure spending and consumer demand. Growth in 2015 is&#13;
estimated at 5.4 percent, a 0.6 percent downward revision from its estimate in December 2014. The revision&#13;
reflects the strong headwinds the economy is facing in the foreign exchange market and the monetary policy&#13;
response to calm those fears.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the current expansionary fiscal path is not sustainable and presents a risk to growth. Although heavy&#13;
infrastructural spending is a boon for Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s production space and future growth, the short - to medium-&#13;
term macro-fiscal framework is vulnerable to macroeconomic shock as fiscal space has been wiped out. The&#13;
overall fiscal deficit of 8.3 percent in 2014/15 and a budgeted 8.7 percent in 2015/16 is high by any standard.&#13;
&#13;
Third, county governments, with support from central authorities have made considerable progress towards&#13;
implementing constitutional and legal provisions for transparency, accountability and participation. In the&#13;
early stages, they prioritized the setting up of structures and systems to facilitate public participation. Counties&#13;
have built communication frameworks, and established participatory forums as per legislative requirements.&#13;
Beyond meeting the legislative requirements counties have adopted innovative initiatives to engage citizens.&#13;
Much still needs to be done to ensure that proper and adequate mechanisms are put in place.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, the high cost of participation, the lack of administrative capacity and trained staff to implement&#13;
participatory processes and tokenistic forms of participation continue to hinder effective citizen engagement.&#13;
While most counties have taken steps to put in place communication systems, most county budgets are still&#13;
not readily available to the public despite requirements of the PFM Act.&#13;
&#13;
As in the past, we are proud to have worked with many Kenyan stakeholders during the preparation of&#13;
this Kenya Economic Update. We hope that it will contribute to their discussions of policy issues that will&#13;
contribute to helping Kenya grow, permanently reduce poverty, and bring shared prosperity to all Kenyans.&#13;

implementing constitutional and legal provisions for transparency, accountability and participation. In the early&#13;
stages, they prioritized the setting up of structures and systems to facilitate public participation. Counties have built&#13;
communication frameworks, and established participatory forums as per legislative requirements. Beyond meeting&#13;
the legislative requirements counties have adopted innovative initiatives to engage citizens. Much still needs to be&#13;
done to ensure that proper and adequate mechanisms are put in place.&#13;
&#13;
The high cost of participation, the lack of administrative capacity and trained staff to implement participatory&#13;
processes and tokenistic forms of participation continue to hinder effective citizen engagement. While most&#13;
counties have taken steps to put in place communication systems, most county budgets are still not readily available&#13;
to the public despite requirements of the PFM Act.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Key recommendations to maintain growth&#13;
Undertake reforms to reduce the structural imbalance in the external account, which has not improved, despite a&#13;
significant drop in the price of oil. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s current account remained high at 9.8 percent in June 2015. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s export&#13;
sector has been lagging since the mid-1990s. Policy makers need to focus on improving Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness and&#13;
increasing the production of traded goods and services to enhance the countryâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to earn foreign exchange&#13;
and boost its external sector. The government is taking steps to improve the investment climate as demonstrated by&#13;
improved operations at the port of Mombasa and infrastructure to support trade. Policy reforms for services trade&#13;
can also have knock-on benefits for manufacturing, and liberalizing it would facilitate firmsâ&#128;&#153; access to services inputs.&#13;
&#13;
Consolidating Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal position is now urgent in the short to medium term. The fiscal balance has deteriorated&#13;
from 1.8 percent in 2007 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2015. Even though some of the fiscal expansion involved huge&#13;
investments in infrastructural projects, these projects have reduced fiscal space and increased debt ratios and&#13;
vulnerability should the country be hit by another macroeconomic shock. The poor fiscal situation has coincided&#13;
with weak external position. Risks to external and fiscal sustainability are a concern if inflows in the future will not be&#13;
sufficient to repay private debt or investments. Without a clear path to fiscal consolidation, there is a potential risk of&#13;
sudden reversal, which could create severe macroeconomic instability.&#13;
&#13;
                         Key recommendations to strengthen participation at the local level&#13;
Invest in building the capacity of county service providers to involve citizens in local service delivery. This can involve&#13;
training civil servants on new responsibilities by incorporating key elements of participation in civil servant training&#13;
programs on PFM, planning and monitoring and evaluation; as well as providing on the job technical assistance.&#13;
Capacity building of county officials should also be accompanied by enhancing the capacity of citizens to engage&#13;
through civic education.&#13;
&#13;
Develop county government systems to facilitate participatory processes. Structured participatory processes&#13;
should complement and support existing internal accountability mechanisms. Facilitating public participation will&#13;
involve; building internal government systems; capacity for planning and managing public finances and procurement;&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; and audit and reporting, and; integrating participatory processes into these systems. Doing&#13;
so entails several actions including supporting counties to make County Budget and Economic Forums operational&#13;
and to design and structure effective participation forums at the sub-county and ward level.&#13;
&#13;
Establish strong incentives for counties to be transparent and foster inclusive citizen participation. This involves&#13;
systematically measuring and comparing county performance and citizen satisfaction on metrics that citizens care&#13;
about. Annually updating and making this information public can increase incentives to improve service delivery&#13;
performance based on systematic assessments of progress.&#13;
&#13;
Non State Actors can expand partnerships to help counties build effective systems and processes for participation,&#13;
transparency and mobilization.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
 K   enyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance remains solid, underpinned by strong infrastructure spending&#13;
     and consumer demand, which are driving growth. On the production side, growth from services,&#13;
 electricity generation and a rebound in agriculture will drive growth in 2015. The World Bank&#13;
 estimates that growth will be 5.4 percent in 2015, a 0.6 percent downward revision of its estimate&#13;
 in December 2014. The revision reflects the strong headwinds the economy is facing in the foreign&#13;
 exchange market, the monetary policy response to calm those fears, and the fact that the effect of&#13;
 lower global oil prices on the wider economy was muted because of the depreciation of the shilling&#13;
 in 2015 and weak transmission into the wider economy. The revised figure is still higher than the&#13;
 average for both lower-middle-income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa. The risks to growth&#13;
 remain the same as in previous Updates except for Chinese devaluation which has heightened&#13;
 global risks. The external sector remains vulnerable to further shocks from weak global export&#13;
 demand exacerbated by weak doing business environment, the continued strengthening of the U.S.&#13;
 dollar, and the authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; response to those external risks. Preliminary analysis shows that the&#13;
 direct transmission from events in China to Kenya are minimal as the renminbi closely tracks the US&#13;
 dollar. While the fiscal deficit of 8.7 percent of GDP has raised concerns at the national level, it is&#13;
 the quality and transparency of spending that is paramount in the devolved system of government.&#13;
 Functional and political devolution to counties also seems beneficial for efficiency, as it provides&#13;
 incentives for county governments to deliver locally preferred services more efficiently, as the&#13;
 burden and benefits of public service delivery accrue in communities. Even though the benefits of&#13;
 devolution have not all been achieved and counties still going through a steep learning curve, a&#13;
 majority of Kenyans still support the devolved system of government despite the challenges being&#13;
 experienced in its implementation. Increasing public participation in budget information can help&#13;
 county governments become more efficient and targeted in the spending and reflect the voices of&#13;
 the people in their spending decisions.&#13;

     production, investment and retail sales data for July were weaker than expected and exports dropping by 8.3 percent in&#13;
     July 2015. The Chinese economy faltered as it continued to experience a string of weakening output growth figures going&#13;
     back to last year and the authorities came under intense pressure internally to address the slowdown.&#13;

    structural imbalance in the external account, unavoidable, given the infrastructure investment&#13;

Kenya relies too heavily on short-term capital flows government starts fiscal consolidation soon, there is&#13;
to service its current account. In order to service a potential risk of sudden reversal that could create&#13;

infrastructure to support trade. An export master slower future growth, because they limit productive&#13;
plan that would help shift resources toward the capacity and increase intertemporal insolvency.&#13;
export sector is now critical.                           Kenya needs to increase its savings and investment&#13;

3. Special Focus: Enabling the Voices of Citizens&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 K   enyaâ&#128;&#153;s Constitution and legal framework on devolution place strong emphasis on public participation,&#13;
     transparency, and accountability as a means of improving efficiency, equity, and inclusiveness of&#13;
 government and service delivery. Multiple studies have documented how governance weaknesses limit&#13;
 Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s socioeconomic development and impede its progress toward national goals for economic growth,&#13;
 job creation, social inclusion, equity, and poverty reduction. Devolution creates a new opportunity, as well&#13;
 as new challenges, for addressing governance weaknesses. Enabling citizen voice is critical to making&#13;
 devolution a success. There is increasing evidence that citizen engagement can improve the rational&#13;
 use of public resources and curb spending leakages. Involving citizens in decision-making processes&#13;
 has the potential not only to improve planning and prioritization by county governments but also to&#13;
 increase local revenues. Devolution alone, however, does not necessarily improve the accountability&#13;
 and responsiveness of service delivery. Multiple factorsâ&#128;&#148;the capacity to disseminate government&#13;
 information in user-friendly formats, the efficiency of the structure, representative consultations with&#13;
 the public, and provision of recourse mechanisms when laws and policies are not followedâ&#128;&#148;must be in&#13;
 place. Public participation itself is not a magic bullet. Effective participation requires coordinated action&#13;
 by the government as well as citizens.&#13;

    Box 3.2: Social accountability has improved spending in several countries&#13;
 In the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, structured budget participation resulted in more pro-poor expenditures, increased&#13;
 access to public services, and greater local government accountability. Municipalities that favored an allocation of&#13;
 public expenditures that closely matched popular preferences channeled a larger fraction of their budgets to investments&#13;
 in sanitation and health. As a result, infant mortality rates fell. The adoption of participatory budgeting also led to a&#13;
 substantive increase in tax revenues, as immediate visibility of the work and services that resulted from their engagement&#13;
 motivated citizens to improve their taxpaying habits (Cabannes 2014; Fox 2014).&#13;
&#13;
 In Uganda systemic implementation of public expenditure tracking surveys established that only 13 percent of capitation&#13;
 grants from the central government were reaching local schools. The government responded by publicizing the funds&#13;
 transferred to schools in local newspapers and radio on a monthly basis. Schools were also required to maintain public&#13;
 notice boards displaying funds received. By 2001, 44 percent of grants reached schools (Fox 2014).&#13;
&#13;
 In South Africa new opportunities for participation on hospital boards led to a switch from a curative approach to one&#13;
 that is primary and holistic, addressing the impacts of socioeconomic issues such as unemployment and poverty on the&#13;
 well-being of the community (Gaventa and Gregory 2010).&#13;
&#13;
 Implementation of citizen report cards in Pakistan resulted in increased enrollment and learning, better-quality&#13;
 education as parents demanded better performance from schools, and increases in school-level investments, such as&#13;
 textbooks (Fiszbein and Ringold 2011).&#13;
&#13;
 In Gujarat, India, the training of elected representatives by a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) on budget&#13;
 information improved the ability of members of the local assembly to understand local budgets and track unspent&#13;
 amounts. It increased the time allocated to budget debates and the debate participation in the local assembles, which&#13;
 raised more budget-related queries (Oâ&#128;&#153;Meally 2015).&#13;

 b. As of 2012, the CPI ranked 176 countries on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). In previous years, the CPI ranked countries on a scale ranging from 0&#13;
    to 10 (Transparency International 2014).&#13;
 c. Higher values indicate better governance outcomes (World Bank 2013b).&#13;
 d. The Open Budget Index measures the budget transparency of countries. Scores are as follows: 81â&#128;&#147;100: Budget provides extensive information; 61â&#128;&#147;80: Budget&#13;
    provides significant information; 41â&#128;&#147;60: Budget provides some information; 21â&#128;&#147;40: Budget provides minimal information; 0â&#128;&#147;20: budget provides scant or no&#13;
    information (International Budget Partnership 2012).&#13;
 e. Doing Business measures business regulations for domestic firms, primarily in the largest business city. It presents quantitative indicators on regulations that&#13;
    apply to firms at different stages of their life cycle. Data highlight the main obstacles to business activities as reported by entrepreneurs in the more than 100&#13;
    economies ranked.&#13;
 f. A lower score indicates greater press freedom (Freedom House 2013).&#13;

     Box 3.3: MajiVoice has increased accountability and customer satisfaction&#13;
 MajiVoice is a web-based software that enables utility staff to receive, process, and report on complaints by customers.&#13;
 After a pilot in Nairobi in 2013, the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NSWSC) launched the system in 2014. It&#13;
 has since been extended to service providers in Mathira, Nakuru, and Nanyuki.&#13;
&#13;
 Customers can submit complaints using a dedicated SMS shortcode, an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data&#13;
 (USSD) shortcode, the Internet, or traditional channels such as a hotline number or walk-in service centers. Free&#13;
 hotlines and low-cost Internet and SMS submissions (which cost KSh 1) give customers multiple ways to avoid time and&#13;
 cost-intensive personal service center visits. For each complaint, a unique reference number is sent to the customer free&#13;
 of charge. It can be used to query the complaint status.&#13;
&#13;
 Majivoice tracks each complaint and every staff action on it, triggering alerts if set&#13;
 resolution ceiling are exceeded. A recent anonymous staff survey shows positive staff&#13;
 response, with large majorities reporting that the MajiVoice system â&#128;&#156;made it easier to&#13;
 deal with and follow up on specific complaintsâ&#128;&#157; (93 percent) and â&#128;&#156;improved the way&#13;
 NCWSC deals with complaintsâ&#128;&#157; (98percent). About a third of surveyed staff reported&#13;
 that MajiVoice increased their personal workload (34 percent) and increased pressure&#13;
 to deal with customer complaints (37 percent).In another recent survey of close to&#13;
 500 customers who had used MajiVoice, more than 74 percent had a positive opinion&#13;
 of the reference number system and more than 50 percent had actively used it to&#13;
 follow up on their complaints. Customers who received MajiVoice reference numbers&#13;
 were significantly more likely to feel that NCWSC took their complaint seriously and&#13;
 reported significantly higher satisfaction with NCWSC services in general.&#13;

 After receiving training on reading and interpreting the budget, the Endorois community of Lower Mochongoi (a&#13;
 subcounty in Baringo) noted that the 2013/14 and 2014/15 county budget ward development project distribution had&#13;
 consistently been unequitable. Out of KSh 56 million spent in the ward in previous financial years, only KSh 4 million had&#13;
 been allocated to the lower Mochongoi area, with the rest going to Upper Mochongoi. During the budget formulation&#13;
 process in February, the community turned out in large numbers. Their concern led the County Executive Committee&#13;
 member for finance and planning to call for a halt of the meeting and the convening of a smaller forum to discuss the&#13;
 disparities. A community committee deliberated on the matter with the county. The outcomes of the deliberation led to a&#13;
 redistribution of four projects from Upper Mochongoi to Lower Mochongoi. The county planning unit also committed to&#13;
 upscale community consultations to ensure that community priorities and concerns are included in the budgeting process.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                  Storm Clouds Gathering&#13;
                       The economy facing strong headwinds&#13;
                     with a special focus on Public Participation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Growth in 2014 was solid and broad based as the economy performed well while absorbing two major&#13;
government programs: devolution and infrastructure scale-up. The economy grew 5.3 percent, driven by&#13;
stronger than expected growth in services and other industry. Consumption demand remained the main&#13;
source of growth. Investment demand rebounded, as investors dropped their wait and see stance.&#13;
&#13;
The special focus of this update highlights the importance of public participation, transparency, and&#13;
accountability as a means of improving eï¬&#131;ciency, equity, and inclusiveness of government and service&#13;
delivery. It examines the progress counties have made in implementing a strong legal framework on&#13;
participation under the devolved system of government, identiï¬&#129;es the successes and challenges, and&#13;
proposes the priority actions that National and County governments can take to enhance public participation.&#13;
&#13;
This report has four messages: First,Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance remains solid, underpinned by strong&#13;
infrastructure spending and consumer demand. Growth in 2015 is estimated at 5.4 percent, a 0.6 percent&#13;
downward revision from its estimate in December 2014. The revision reï¬&#130;ects the strong headwinds the&#13;
economy is facing in the foreign exchange market and the monetary policy response to calm those fears.&#13;
Second, the current expansionary ï¬&#129;scal path is not sustainable and presents a risk to growth. Although&#13;
heavy infrastructural spending is a boon for Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s production space and future growth, the short - to&#13;
medium-term macro-ï¬&#129;scal framework is vulnerable to macroeconomic shock as ï¬&#129;scal space has been&#13;
wiped out.&#13;
&#13;
Third, county governments, with support from central authorities have made considerable progress towards&#13;
implementing constitutional and legal provisions for transparency, accountability and participation. In the&#13;
early stages, they prioritized the setting up of structures and systems to facilitate public participation.&#13;
Counties have built communication frameworks, and established participatory forums as per legislative&#13;
requirements. Beyond meeting the legislative requirements counties have adopted innovative initiatives to&#13;
engage citizens. Much still needs to be done to ensure that proper and adequate mechanisms are put in place.&#13;
Lastly, the high cost of participation, the lack of administrative capacity and trained staï¬&#128; to implement&#13;
participatory processes and tokenistic forms of participation continue to hinder eï¬&#128;ective citizen engagement.&#13;
While most counties have taken steps to put in place communication systems, most county budgets are still&#13;
not readily available to the public despite requirements of the PFM Act.&#13;
