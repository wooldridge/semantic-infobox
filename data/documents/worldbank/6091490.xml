By tracing Japan's history, the paper argues that families and communities have played&#13;
important roles in the country's successful socioeconomic performance. The argument is&#13;
first made by comparing Japan's socioeconomic data with those of other OECD&#13;
countries. Then, the paper presents some case studies to gain a better understanding of the&#13;
roles played by Japanese families and communities. This does not imply, however, that&#13;
government had a small role. On the contrary, the Japanese government succeeded in&#13;
attaining high socioeconomic levels at relatively low cost by supporting and utilizing&#13;
families &amp; communities. This may be termed a Japanese-style welfare policy. Finally, the&#13;
paper argues that along with economic growth in Japan, family and community ties have&#13;
weakened to a point at which the government must assume larger roles to maintain&#13;
socioeconomic performance.&#13;

This paper was prepared for a project on Social Development in East Asia. The project&#13;
was organized by the World Bank Institute under the auspices of the Program for the&#13;
Study of the Japanese Development Management Experience (The Brain Trust Program),&#13;
which is financed by the Policy and Human Resources Development Trust Fund&#13;
established at the World Bank by the Government of Japan (GOJ). We greatly appreciate&#13;
the generous support from GOJ.&#13;
&#13;
The principal objectives of this Program are to conduct studies on Japanese and East&#13;
Asian development management experience and to share the lessons of this experience&#13;
with developing and transition economies. The experiences of other countries are often&#13;
covered in order to ensure that these lessons are placed in the proper context. This&#13;
comparative method helps identify factors that influence the effectiveness of specific&#13;
institutional mechanisms, governance structures, and policy reforms in different contexts.&#13;
A related objective of the Program is to promote the exchange of ideas on development&#13;
among Japanese and non-Japanese scholars, technical experts and policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
The papers commissioned for this project cover a number of important issues related to&#13;
Japanese Social Policy. These issues include, among other, Japanese pension system,&#13;
public health insurance in Japan, evolution of social policy in Japan, role of families,&#13;
communities and government in improving socioeconomic performance, and Japanese&#13;
policies towards poverty &amp; public assistance. We hope that these papers will provide&#13;
important policy findings and lessons for policymakers in developing countries and other&#13;
development stakeholders.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
&#13;
By tracing Japan's history, we argue that families and communities have played important roles in the&#13;
country's successful socieconomic performance. The argument is first made by comparing Japan's&#13;
socioeconomic data with those of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
(OECD) countries. Then, we look into some case studies to gain a better understanding of the roles played&#13;
by Japanese families and communities. This argument does not imply, however, that government had a&#13;
small role; on the contrary, the Japanese government succeeded in attaining high socioeconomic levels at&#13;
relatively low cost by supporting and utilizing families and communities (which may be termed a&#13;
Japanese-style welfare policy). Finally we argue that along with economic growth in Japan, family and&#13;
community ties have weakened to a point at which the government must assume larger roles to maintain&#13;
socioeconomic performance.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
In 1990's Human Development Report by the United Nations (UNDP 1990), Japan was given the highest&#13;
human development ranking based on: (a) life expectancy, (b) literacy ratio, and (c) gross national product&#13;
(GNP) per capita. (See table 1.) Although it is not easy to construct a measure for socioeconomic&#13;
performance, there is no doubt that these indexes are important elements of any such measure. The table&#13;
also lists in its fifth column the number of homicides per 100,000 people, which suggests that Japan also&#13;
performs well in terms of a safe social environment.1&#13;
    It is natural to wonder how Japan has attained such high levels of social performance.&#13;
    Needless to say, high economic performance represented by per capita GNP is an important factor. It&#13;
is not, however, a sufficient (or necessary) condition for high social performance. For instance, some oil-&#13;
producing high-income countries (for example, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait) do not perform well&#13;
socially, and some low-income countries (for example, Spain and Ireland) are ranked as countries with&#13;
high social performance. Furthermore, as table 2 shows, Japan had already attained high socioeconomic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1   The homicide rate need not be that of 1987. Note also that the source of social expenditure for Switzerland is different from the one&#13;
    for other countries because it was not available in the same data set.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                     1&#13;

nations.&#13;

    Given such facts, a standard explanation may be that government policies are important factors in high&#13;
social performance. By looking at the per capita social expenditure (in Purchasing Power Pairty or PPP&#13;
U.S. dollars) in the fourth data column of tables 1 and 2, however, we recognize that Japan has one of the&#13;
lowest figures among developed countries.2 So the question before us is: Why has Japan attained this level&#13;
with such a low per capita social expenditure?&#13;
    In this paper we argue that families and communities have played important roles in Japan's social&#13;
development performance. This, however, does not mean the government's role has been minimal; rather,&#13;
we claim that the government succeeded in attaining high socioeconomic levels (with relatively low costs) by&#13;
capitalizing on the strong ties typifying families and communities in Japan. Then, we argue that these family&#13;
and community ties have been weakening to a point at which the government must take on a larger role in the&#13;
future to maintain socioeconomic performance.&#13;

    The paper is organized in seven sections including this introduction. In the next section, we provide a&#13;
conceptual framework developed in Yamashige (1995), which tries to clarify the relationship among&#13;
families, communities, markets, and governments. We also show, as a preliminary, that social&#13;
expenditures have indeed been small in Japan even if we take the effects of the elderly ratio into account.&#13;
In the two subsequent sections we examine families and communities in Japan, respectively, to show that&#13;
their strengths feed Japan's socioeconomic success. In the fifth section, by examining the history of social&#13;
policies and the ideology of the "Japanese-style welfare society" in Japan, we argue that the strength of&#13;
families and communities has been purposely maintained and used by the Japanese government. Then, in&#13;
the sixth section, we turn to the present and future of Japanese society to show that the government is now&#13;
required to take on a more active role in maintaining the socioeconomic situation because families and&#13;
communities have lost their strength. Concluding remarks are in the final section.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The first objective of this section is to provide a conceptual framework as a theoretical basis of our&#13;
analysis of the roles of families and communities in Japan. The second objective is to show that the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
government expenditure on socioeconomic development has indeed been small, which is an empirical&#13;
basis for our claim that it is families and communities in Japan, not the government, that have played&#13;
important roles in improving socioeconomic performance.&#13;
    Our well-being is dependent on various factors. We think that the following four are especially&#13;
important; (a) material affluence, (b) risk-sharing (for example, receiving care when sick or bedridden), (c)&#13;
a positive social environment (for example, a safe living environment), and (d) a livable natural&#13;
environment (for example, clean air and water).&#13;
    In this paper, we refer to the success in attaining material affluence as economic performance, and to&#13;
the success in improving risk-sharing, social environment, and natural environment as social performance.&#13;
The quality of our lives is determined by both economic and social performance. In order to improve their&#13;
quality of life, societies have developed and used social institutions such as families, communities,&#13;
markets, and governments.&#13;
    Markets have helped us use our resources efficiently and thus reach material affluence. They also help&#13;
us insure ourselves against risks. However, markets do not guarantee material affluence for everyone;&#13;
some people will suffer under a purely market-driven system, which can be seen as a failure of insurance&#13;
against the risks of being born poor. Furthermore, markets cannot fully insure risks in general, owing to&#13;
moral hazard and adverse selection problems. In essence, markets do not necessarily improve our social&#13;
environment--or protect our natural environment, either, for that matter.&#13;
    In short, markets are not almighty. In fact, historically speaking, they have not been the main&#13;
institution that would be expected to maintain the quality of our lives (see, for example, Malinowski&#13;
(1922)). Families and communities have played important roles in improving social performance by&#13;
protecting the lives of unfortunate individuals, by sharing various risks, and by solving the problems&#13;
related to externalities to improve social and natural environments. They also have helped improve&#13;
economic performance by non-anonymous exchanges of goods and services (even though the ability of&#13;
this measure to bring together potential traders and thus improve economic efficiency is far inferior to&#13;
anonymous trading in markets). Now, in many so-called welfare states, governments have taken over the&#13;
roles of families and communities in improving social performance (for example, see Coleman (1990)).&#13;
    In order to clarify the relationship among communities (including families), markets and governments,&#13;
Yamashige (1995) presented the schema shown in figure 1 below:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
    In the hypothesis, a family is identified as a special case of a community because socioeconomic roles&#13;
and the mechanism to implement them are not so different between the two cases. Namely, by a&#13;
community we envision an institution whose goal is to improve the welfare of its members; a family is a&#13;
special case of this, and conversely, communities are somewhat perceived as extended families.&#13;
    There are three causal relations in the diagram. Based on these we will outline three hypotheses:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (H1) As the market system expands in a society, more goods and services (including insurance)&#13;
           become available, and thus each individual loses reasons for remaining a community member.&#13;
           Furthermore, when everything is available in markets, social punishments unleashed by&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            communities (for example, ostracism) are no longer effective in inducing cooperation for&#13;
            improving social performance;&#13;
    (H2) As community ties weaken, they have a harder time maintaining social performance and thus&#13;
            people come to demand that government play the roles that communities had shouldered up to&#13;
            that point; and&#13;
    (H3) As the government's role as a substitute grows, communities become weaker.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    According to our hypothesis, before a market system prevailed, communities played roles that&#13;
governments are now playing. In this scenario, society can attain a high level of social performance with&#13;
low government expenditure. As the market system infiltrates society and the economy grows, community&#13;
ties weaken as mentioned earlier and government expenditure also grows in order to maintain social&#13;
performance.&#13;
    Needless to say, good social performance will help increase material affluence (in other words,&#13;
economic performance) by, for example, making quality health care, good education, and trust among&#13;
people possible (compare Fukuyama (1995)). Thus, understanding social mechanisms to improve social&#13;
performance is quite important in evaluating development strategies in many countries.&#13;
    In the following sections, we show that this conceptual framework is useful for understanding Japan's&#13;
socioeconomic history and the roles of family and community institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Is Government Expenditure in Japan Really Small?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The government's "social expenditure"--which is the sum of expenditures on education, health, social&#13;
security, and welfare--is often used to measure its role of improving social performance. As we have&#13;
already seen in table 1, this expenditure has typically been smaller in Japan relative to other developed&#13;
countries. In this detailed comparison, however, we think that it is important to make certain&#13;
adjustments to consider the effects of the elderly ratio on social expenditures because there seems to be&#13;
a positive correlation between the elderly ratio (ER) and the GNP ratio of noneducational social&#13;
expenditure (SOCX).3 We find the correlation between the two as shown in figure 2 and the following&#13;
equation.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Given the slope, we set the adjusted SOCX by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in which we choose the average elderly ratio 14 percent to minimize the errors in the adjustment. The&#13;
adjusted social expenditure, which is the sum of the adjusted noneducational social expenditure and the&#13;
educational social expenditure, is shown in figure 3. The figure shows that even after some adjustment, the&#13;
social expenditure in Japan is still one of the lowest among developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3   In the following comparison, we analyze the data for 18 countries in table 1 (other than Switzerland, for which we could not obtain the&#13;
    data from the same source). The elderly ratio is taken from United Nations (1995).&#13;
                                                                                           Â­                Â­&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Accepting that the social expenditure of the Japanese government has been small, the fact that the&#13;
people have been successful socioeconomically looks puzzling. As we have already suggested, however,&#13;
the picture becomes clearer once we recognize the roles played by families and communities in Japan.&#13;
     In the next two sections, we try to show that families and communities were strong in Japan in the&#13;
past, and we try to find out how they helped the population improve socioeconomically. Our discussion&#13;
should show that families mainly acted as units of risk-sharing, and communities made great efforts to&#13;
improve and maintain the social environment.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Family Ties in Japan&#13;
&#13;
In this section, first we show that families in Japan have strong ties compared with those in other&#13;
developed countries, and that they have played important roles in improving risk-sharing and maintaining&#13;
the social environment. Then we argue that these roles have been sustained by a social norm dictating that&#13;
women should take care of the home.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Strength of Families: An International Comparison&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We start by looking into whether family ties are really strong in Japan. Although it is not an easy indicator&#13;
to quantify, let us first look at average household sizes and divorce rates in table 3, which is based on&#13;
United Nations (1987, 1991).&#13;
     We think that household size is a reliable measure for determining family strength because a large&#13;
household enables a family to carry risk-sharing roles efficiently (as the law of larger numbers suggests).&#13;
Divorce rates also reflect this strength because the longer contract terms are (as the theory of repeated&#13;
games suggests) the greater the likelihood of cooperation among family members to improve the social&#13;
environment. The table shows that Japan is third (behind Ireland and Spain) in average household size and&#13;
is also third (behind Spain and Italy) in terms of its divorce rate among countries examined. Although the&#13;
data above are suggestive, it does not provide us with a clear portrait of Japanese families, which we will&#13;
explore in greater detail here.&#13;
     One of the characteristics of a Japanese family is that the ratio of elderly people living with their&#13;
children is quite high. A study by the Prime Minister's Office (1981) summarized in table 4 shows that in&#13;
Japan many old people have been living with their children (especially with their son's family), while in&#13;
Western societies the elderly are more or less living independent lives. According to the 1980 census,&#13;
among the elderly over 65, about 70 percent were living with their own children in Japan; and the ratio&#13;
was more than 80 percent about 1960 (see also figure 13).&#13;
     Moreover, we would like to argue that family strength reduces government expenditure. The&#13;
following simple analysis shows a relationship between health expenditure and the ratio of the elderly&#13;
living with their children. Using the data of each prefecture during 1992Â­93, we find that the national&#13;
health expenditure per person (NHE) shows a negative correlation with the ratio of the elderly living with&#13;
their children (RLC), in addition to the positive correlation with the elderly ratio (ER).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                      (1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5    It is useful to point out that communities also have acted as units of risk-sharing, especially in cases in which an individual loses&#13;
     family members or in which families cannot fully absorb some risks.&#13;

    Since health expenditure decreases as the ratio of the elderly living with children goes up, it seems&#13;
natural to claim that a large amount of health expenditure to be paid by the government is saved by this&#13;
living arrangement. In other words, the strong family ties in Japan seem to be an important factor that&#13;
allows the Japanese government to save on social expenditures.&#13;

    In order for families to play positive roles, however, someone in a family must take on the&#13;
responsibility. In Japan, this person is typically a woman.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Women's Roles in Japanese Families&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to a study by the Prime Minister's Office (1992), most housekeeping jobs are carried out by&#13;
wives, as table 5 shows below.&#13;
    It is important for us to note that wives play important roles in caring for children and the elderly. A&#13;
closer look at these roles also shows that the entire family pitches in with such tasks, which suggests that&#13;
families can be seen as risk-sharing units headed by wives.&#13;
    A striking result in a study by Nippon Housou Kyoukai (NHK, or Japan Broadcasting Corporation)&#13;
(1994) on time use is that Japanese women sleep almost an hour less than women in Western countries&#13;
examined, which suggests that Japanese women are overworked (compare panel A in figure 5).6 Instead of&#13;

6   A brief explanation may be necessary for some items. First, the term "personal affairs" refers to dressing oneself, going to the&#13;
    bathroom, recuperating, and receiving medical treatment. The term "miscellaneous" refers to caring for the elderly and the sick,&#13;
    gardening, sewing, and knitting. Finally, "social activities" refer to volunteer activities; associations with colleges, friends, family; and&#13;
    phone calls. See the appendix, item 3 for more information.&#13;

    One of the reasons why wives play such important roles in Japanese families is that there is a social&#13;
norm dictating that husbands work for bread and wives take care of the house.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7   Panel B in figure 5 shows that Japanese men sleep less and work more than men in Western countries. This is compensated, however,&#13;
    mainly by the shorter time for housekeeping jobs carried out by men in Japan, which is not the case for Japanese women. It is in this&#13;
    sense that Japanese women are overworked. At the same time, it may be useful to point out that Japanese women, on average have the&#13;
    longest life span in the world. As of 1995, life expectancy at birth is 82.9 years for Japanese women and 76.4 years for Japanese men.&#13;
8   Among households in which husbands are employed in the nonagricultural sector, about 43 percent of wives were also employed&#13;
    workers in 1985. The number has been steadily increasing and in 1992 it exceeded 50 percent.&#13;

    An interesting fact is that many wives favor this division of labor, as figure 6 shows (Tokyo&#13;
Metropolitan Government (1992)).&#13;

    Reflecting this social norm in Japan, wives have been expected to take care of the elderly. Table 6&#13;
shows that many Japanese expect daughters-in-law and daughters to take care of them when necessary&#13;
(Management and Coordination Agency (1981, 1994)).&#13;
    Since wives have been expected to take care of family members in Japan, we can say that the positive&#13;
role of the Japanese family has been maintained by this division of labor--in other words, this&#13;
specialization by housewives in housekeeping.&#13;
    The fairly strong division of labor between men and women in Japan can be also seen in the study by&#13;
NHK (1994). Table 7 shows the difference in time use between men and women in various countries. The&#13;
variance shown at the bottom of each column indicates that roles played by men and women are different&#13;
in Japan compared with Western countries examined.&#13;
    Since strong families are useful for governments to maintain social performance at low cost, it is&#13;
natural that the Japanese government has encouraged strong family ties.&#13;
    As Campbell (1992) explains, there have been many tax breaks and housing loans to families that&#13;
support the elderly: "An elderly dependent rates a higher exemption for the national income tax and the&#13;
local residents tax, and older people's own income, particularly pensions, receives advantageous tax&#13;
treatment. Larger government-supported loans and easier terms are provided to families living with a&#13;
parent who are building a new house, and special loan programs, mostly from pension funds, cover adding&#13;
room to an existing house." (p.19)&#13;

    Another famous example is that of favorable tax breaks and a social security system for housewives.&#13;
In the example illustrated in figure 7, a husband is assumed to have an annual pretax income of 6 million&#13;
yen. As his wife starts working, the sum of their after-tax income increases until she earns 1 million yen, at&#13;
which point their after-tax income is suddenly reduced because "spouse allowances" are cut; and the&#13;
second drop of the after-tax income occurs when she earns 1.2 million yen because the wife now has to&#13;
pay her own social insurance.&#13;

     Needless to say, such a policy has created a fairly strong incentive for working wives to avoid earning&#13;
more than 1 million yen a year.9 The division of labor and the social norm shaping it, however, have not&#13;
been immune to recent change, as the comparison of data in 1981 and 1994 in table 6, for example,&#13;
suggests.10 This problem will be discussed later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community Ties in Japan&#13;
&#13;
We showed in the previous section that families had strong ties and were instrumental in improving risk-&#13;
sharing and the social environment. Families, however, are often too small to fully hedge risks and create a&#13;
good social and natural environment. Therefore it is natural to expect that larger units such as communities&#13;
play greater roles in improving social performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Neighborhood Associations as Nonprofit Organizations in Japan&#13;
&#13;
Since feudal times, communities in Japan have featured strong neighborhood associations.11 In September&#13;
1940, to provide channels for transmitting government policies down to the people during the war, Home&#13;
Ministry Ordinance No. 17 called for the political organization of neighborhood associations. In 1947 the&#13;
general headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (referred to as GHQ/SCAP)&#13;
abolished the ordinance and tried to ban the neighborhood associations as well because of their&#13;
"undemocratic" nature.&#13;
     As the ordinance outlawing neighborhood associations became void in October 1952 after the San&#13;
Francisco Peace Treaty, neighborhood associations reemerged out of the underground to play active roles.&#13;
It is said that the government contemplated the revival of a uniform, legalized system of neighborhood&#13;
associations, but it did not take any step toward this reestablishment. Nevertheless, neighborhood&#13;
associations continue to be important institutions in Japan. A study by the Ministry of Home Affairs&#13;
(MOHA) in 1980 (compare Isomura and Hoshino (1990)) reported that there were 274,738 neighborhood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9    This type of discontinuity has recently been removed.&#13;
10   An interesting question is why the norm has survived in Japan. Besides the simple answer to the effect that it is a social norm and&#13;
     therefore should survive as a matter of course, we think that government policy has helped. First, favorable policies toward families&#13;
     that follow the norm provide an incentive. Second, in Garon's terminology (1997), "moral suasion" by the government to maintain the&#13;
     social norm may have helped.&#13;
11   We use the term "neighborhood associations" to mean various types of local community associations, such as Chonaikai (block&#13;
     associations), Jichikai (autonomy associations), Seinenkai (young people's associations), Fujinkai (women's associations),&#13;
     Bohankyokai (crime prevention associations), and so on.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14        Shinji Yamashige&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
associations in Japan, and that among 3,278 districts (cities, towns, and villages), 87 percent had a system&#13;
of neighborhood associations covering every part of the district, and 9.1 percent had a system covering&#13;
nearly every part (more than 90 percent) of the district.&#13;
     There have been many debates on why GHQ/SCAP attempted to abolish neighborhood associations&#13;
and whether this was wise policy.12 A repeatedly discussed view is that GHQ/SCAP might have been able&#13;
to use strong neighborhood associations as an instrument for implementing occupation policies and&#13;
especially as "a force in democratic education." We do not know if that would have been possible. One&#13;
thing that is clear to us, however, is that the GHQ/SCAP policy transformed neighborhood associations&#13;
from administrative units to nonprofit organizations (NPOs).13&#13;
     The MOHA study mentioned above also reports on the budgets and functions of neighborhood&#13;
associations. According to the study, 86.2 percent of neighborhood associations collected contributions&#13;
from inhabitants, and 35.5 percent received some kind of subsidy (consisting of 6.8 percent of the revenue&#13;
for an average neighborhood association). Furthermore, 70.3 percent were asked to carry out certain tasks&#13;
by local governments (in return for subsidies)--that is, to act as agencies. As for the functions of&#13;
neighborhood associations, we can see them in table 8.&#13;

     The table shows us many interesting aspects of these associations. The first two functions suggest a&#13;
close relationship between neighborhood associations and local governments. Other functions show that&#13;
the associations play active roles in improving the social environment of the community and risk-sharing&#13;
(via mutual help).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12   See, for example, Steiner (1965).&#13;
13   Some may find it difficult to call neighborhood associations NPOs because individual participation is often compulsory (automatic).&#13;
     Furthermore, participation is not by individuals but by households, and most neighborhood associations are not legal organizations.&#13;
     Nevertheless, owing to the lack of official enforcement devices, participation is technically voluntary, and as we shall see below the&#13;
     actual functions are indeed those that are expected of NPOs (compare Salamon and Anheier (1996, p. xvii)).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Some activities of neighborhood associations are similar to those of local governments and of&#13;
religious groups (for example, churches) in Western societies.14 Specifically, it would be natural to&#13;
conclude that churches are a counterpart of neighborhood associations because many neighborhood&#13;
associations are often centered around community temples (especially in rural areas). Even though their&#13;
close relationship with community temples are evident, most associations are not officially affiliated with&#13;
them.&#13;
    As the discussion above suggests, many neighborhood associations in Japan are entities whose&#13;
relationship with local governments and community temples are ambiguously delineated. This does not&#13;
seem to be a serious problem for many Japanese who are, in some sense, "pragmatic" in making their&#13;
societies better. According to research by Iwasaki and others (1989), we can see that many people do not&#13;
harbor negative opinions about neighborhood associations (table 9).&#13;

&#13;
    Indeed, the general attitude towards neighborhood associations is positive.15 The questionnaire in table&#13;
10 examines why.&#13;
    For many Japanese, neighborhood associations are valuable for their abilities in improving human&#13;
relationships, safety, and hygiene in their neighborhood. Although participation is somewhat&#13;
compulsory, many feel that the associations are good systems, especially for improving the social&#13;
environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14  Historically, neighborhood associations have played more active roles than the recent studies above suggest. For example, at the end&#13;
    of the last century, many schools, roads, and bridges were built by the efforts of neighborhood associations. See, for instance, Steiner&#13;
    (1965).&#13;
15  Many people show weak support for neighborhood associations probably because these have both positive and negative sides. They&#13;
    help maintain a stable social environment, but on the flip side, people's participation and contributions are semi-mandatory.&#13;

A Case Study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We showed in the last subsection that neighborhood associations in Japan have played many roles that&#13;
local governments would have played in other countries. Japanese local governments have used&#13;
neighborhood associations to complement their tasks at low cost via monetary contributions and volunteer&#13;
work donated by association members.16 In the following paragraphs, we want to discuss a case study&#13;
(Iwasaki and others 1989) on neighborhood associations in Ueda, a mid-size city in Japan.&#13;
    Ueda is a third-largest city in the prefecture of Nagano. The city's population was 116,178 as of 1985.&#13;
The working population is divided into manufacturing (36 percent), retail and wholesale (21 percent),&#13;
services (17 percent), agriculture (9 percent), and others (17 percent). Like many cities of this size in&#13;
Japan, it has experienced a shift from agriculture to manufacturing: the agricultural population dropped by&#13;
30 percent from 1965 to 1985. In Ueda, there are 156 "autonomy associations" (neighborhood&#13;
associations); their membership ranges from 25 households to 1,402 households. (The average is 234). We&#13;
will now summarize some basic facts about them.&#13;
    (1) The characteristics of the chairmen: The characteristics of the chairmen in each autonomous&#13;
association are informative. First, many are chosen from a pool of elderly people. More than 65 percent of&#13;
them are over 60 years old. Second, many of them (32 percent) are retired persons (of which 51 percent&#13;
are retired civil servants), which is considered important in terms of their relationship with the local&#13;
government. The term of a chairman is usually short; 83 percent of the terms last less than three years.&#13;
About 45 percent of these chairmen are chosen by the votes of all members. The rest are chosen by&#13;
indirect voting among executive members, or by recommendations from general members.&#13;
    (2) The inhabitants' participation: It is said that 61 percent of autonomy associations consider the&#13;
participation of each household in the association to be automatic, 22 percent encourage each household to&#13;
participate, and 11 percent think that participation is voluntary. In general, however, most people think that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16  Since such contributions are often half-mandatory, they can be seen as "hidden taxes." Therefore it would be interesting to estimate&#13;
    such hidden taxes; the result may show that if we add these to formal taxes then the actual taxes paid by Japanese may not be as small&#13;
    as the official statistics show. Unfortunately, such a study is not easy owing to a lack of statistical data on neighborhood associations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
participation is a matter of course. It is reported that inhabitants are required to write down the name of&#13;
their own autonomy association when they ask the local government to issue certificates, and city&#13;
newsletters are distributed via autonomy associations, which implies that only members can receive them&#13;
automatically, and nonmembers must get them by themselves.&#13;
    (3) Budgets: The average annual revenue of each autonomy association is 32.7 million yen. Major&#13;
sources are inhabitants' fees and local government subsidies. The average inhabitants' fee is 825 yen per&#13;
month and the average government subsidy (for example, for the circulation of the city newsletter and the&#13;
cleaning of ditches) is 1,310 yen per year (for each average household). Although the expenditure side is&#13;
not clear owing to the difficulty in obtaining financial reports, analysis shows that allowances to executive&#13;
members, costs of cultural and sports events, costs of fire prevention, and donations are major sources of&#13;
expenditure. Autonomy associations pay donations (whose amounts are often assigned to each association&#13;
in various donation campaigns--of the Red Cross, for example) by charging an amount for each&#13;
household (for example, about 100 yen per month). It is said that the goals of donation campaigns are thus&#13;
reached quite easily.&#13;
    (4) Administrative complaints: Among various complaints in the administration of autonomy&#13;
associations, the following are major ones: "too many tasks are commissioned by local governments (77&#13;
percent)," "few want to be executive members (50 percent)," and "members are indifferent to and passive&#13;
in community activities (36 percent)." These indicate that the tasks expected of each association are&#13;
numerous and thus few people actively want to participate.&#13;
    (5) The association's relationship with the local government: The local government's views may be&#13;
seen in its "Long-Term Visions," a document prepared by the government of Ueda. It says that "each&#13;
autonomy association is a tie which connects people and the government. Through active communications&#13;
of inhabitants in each autonomy association, wills of the people shall be reflected in the government policy&#13;
and the improvement in social environments and the welfare of the people shall be pursued. For this&#13;
purpose, the government encourages the sense of autonomy of autonomy associations, their cooperation&#13;
with the government which respects their voluntary actions, and the strength of the organizations," and&#13;
that "the government recognizes that the autonomy associations are voluntary organizations, and it&#13;
supports them so that they can play their roles in the communities." Data reveal that the government&#13;
responds quite positively to the demands of autonomy associations (76 percent resolution rate) in addition&#13;
to paying subsidies to them. The following schema (figure 8) summarizes the interdependence of&#13;
autonomy associations and the government.&#13;

&#13;
Summary&#13;
&#13;
The discussion above shows how communities in Japan (neighborhood associations) have helped to&#13;
improve social performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Functions of Japanese communities are not that different from those of churches or "communities" in&#13;
Western societies. A big difference is that household participation in a neighborhood association is&#13;
mandatory. This prevents the free-rider problem and thus the undersupply of the voluntary provision of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18       Shinji Yamashige&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
public goods. Especially in big cities where socially marginal people are often neglected or tend to commit&#13;
crimes aided by the anonymity there, this system of neighborhood associations seems valuable. The&#13;
division of cities into smaller associations and each household's mandatory participation in one of them&#13;
have prevented negligence toward those who need care and help, and also have prevented crimes, helping&#13;
cities to maintain a good social environment. In short, we believe that this compulsory nature of&#13;
neighborhood associations is a key element in evaluating the successful social performance of Japanese&#13;
communities.&#13;
    In a study of communities in Japan, it is not easy to identify the effects of neighborhood associations&#13;
on social performance because there are few official data on them. Hence, as proxies for community ties,&#13;
we used the ratio of owned houses (ROH) and the number of consultations by welfare commissioners17&#13;
(CWC) in each prefecture and examined their relationship with the crime rate (CR). Since people would&#13;
come to have long-term relationships with and thus strong ties to the community when they owned homes&#13;
in great numbers, and since consultations by welfare commissioners could be seen as evidence that people&#13;
trust neighbors, we expected both to have a positive impact on reducing the crime rate. The result, shown&#13;
in the following equation and mapped out in figure 9, validates our assumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                              (2)&#13;

17  The welfare commissioners are volunteer social workers who work in communities; they are commissioned by the Minister of Health&#13;
    and Welfare and expected to work with local governments. The history of the welfare commissioner system is similar to that of&#13;
    neighborhood associations, which were banned by the SCAP after the war because of their ambiguous relationship with local&#13;
    governments. The Japanese government then changed the name to revive the system probably because of its perceived value in&#13;
    managing the people's welfare at low cost. See also Garon (1995, p. 24) for a brief account.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Although both explanatory variables may not be satisfactory proxies for the strength of community&#13;
ties, the fairly strong relationship with the crime rate seems to suggest that Japanese communities do play&#13;
a role in preventing crimes and thus reducing local governments' expenditures.&#13;
     The mandatory nature of neighborhood associations, however, is also a problem. In this respect, each&#13;
neighborhood association is almost like a government, but without any legal rights. Therefore some people,&#13;
especially those who are accustomed to contract-based human relationships, are opposed to the existence and&#13;
activities of neighborhood associations. It does not seem to be a serious problem, however, for ordinary&#13;
Japanese because of the associations' long tradition--and reaction against these associations is muted&#13;
because local governments are able to use them to maintain the social environment at fairly low cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Japanese-Style Welfare Policy&#13;
&#13;
In the previous two sections, we showed that families and communities in Japan have kept relatively&#13;
strong ties and played active roles in maintaining their social environment. At the same time, we suggested&#13;
that the Japanese government has also played active roles in supporting families and communities in order&#13;
for them to be able to play their roles--for example, by providing various tax breaks and subsidies to&#13;
families and communities.&#13;
     Looking back at the history of government policies in Japan, we recognize that this is exactly what the&#13;
Japanese government has intended to do since the Meiji era when a Western-style modern government was&#13;
established after the shogunal period. For example, Garon (1997) describes the idea of the Meiji&#13;
government as follows: "Tokonami TakejirÃ¿, chief of the Bureau of Local Affairs in 1910 and later an&#13;
influential home minister, emphasized the role of the Japanese family. In Western countries, where&#13;
`individualism' flourished, elaborate welfare programs treated members of families as individuals, but `in&#13;
Japan, the family is the unit of society. A parent must raise a child, and a child must help his parent.&#13;
Brothers must be kind to each other.... This has been the social organization of our country since ancient&#13;
times.' The reliance on the family, asserted Tokonami, explained why there were so few poor people in&#13;
Japan, despite `extremely low expenditures' on charity and relief efforts" (pp. 41Â­42).&#13;
     Garon (1997) also clearly recognizes that although the Japanese government did not provide relief to&#13;
individuals, it is not a "laissez-faire" administration that just hopes families and communities would take&#13;
care of the unfortunate: "Although the imported doctrine of laissez-faire reinforced the Meiji government's&#13;
determination to avoid large expenditures on poor relief, Japanese officials categorically rejected the&#13;
liberal principle that the state should play a minor role in managing the welfare of its people. Whereas&#13;
liberal thinkers hoped that people would aid their unfortunate neighbors out of a sense of moral duty, the&#13;
authorities did their utmost to manage the provision of relief at the local levels so that `mutual fellowship&#13;
among the people' [would] become [a] reality.... `Laissez-faire' would have been the last word to describe&#13;
the many instances in which the state intervened to force families and neighbors to aid the poor" (p.38).&#13;
     Schematically, the Japanese-style welfare policy can be illustrated as in figure 10.18&#13;
     In contrast to what we call "laissez-faire policy" and "Western-style welfare policy,"19 in Japanese-&#13;
style welfare policy the government plays a major role in supporting families and communities (but not&#13;
individuals) in order to manage the welfare of individuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18   Recently, Esping-Andersen (1997) argued that the Japanese welfare state is not a unique system but a hybrid of European and&#13;
     American models of the welfare state. His argument is based on his classification of social systems in the world (Esping-Andersen&#13;
     1990). Since societies are changing over time, however, it does not seem all that meaningful to argue which group Japanese society&#13;
     belongs to or whether Japanese society is unique or a hybrid case. From the viewpoint of the theory of states (social policies), it seems&#13;
     more useful not to classify societies but to develop a simple conceptual framework that allows us to discuss directions in which a&#13;
     society is going. The following argument is an attempt to construct such a framework. As far as government policies are concerned,&#13;
     we believe that the Japanese system is a unique one--as, for example, Japan's lowest-in-the-world GDP ratio of social expenditure&#13;
     suggests (compare table 1).&#13;
19   We are not sure that the term "western-style welfare policy" is appropriate for describing the type of welfare policy here because&#13;
     many welfare policies (for example, family policies) in the West have the structure of what we call Japanese-style. We use the term&#13;
     because from a Japanese viewpoint, the relationship between the government and individuals described here is typically Western.&#13;

    Once we understand how people's welfare can be maintained, the idea above can be translated into the&#13;
following diagram (figure 11) in which three "ideal" types are identified and actual types of policies can&#13;

    After World War II, many policy changes were made. We believe, however, that the idea of a&#13;
Japanese-style welfare state has so far survived in Japan21 just as the system of neighborhood associations&#13;
has endured. Garon (1997) describes the postwar evolution of Japanese welfare policy as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20  Needless to say, most societies including Japan will be located not on the axes but in the interior of the graph because they usually&#13;
    support both individuals and families or communities, but with different degrees of emphasis.&#13;
21  Campbell (1992) is skeptical on this point:&#13;
&#13;
        Has [the notion of Japanese-style welfare society] dominated policy toward the elderly? Perhaps in one negative sense: the&#13;
        assumption that older people should be cared for by their families allowed the government to delay paying livable pension&#13;
        benefits and to provide lower levels of various other services than in other advanced nations. But contrary to popular impression,&#13;
        neither community--voluntary groups in local areas--nor the firms play a very large role in welfare provision for the elderly,&#13;
        certainly nothing like in the United States.... Viewing Japanese toward the elderly as a whole, similarities with the West greatly&#13;
        overshadow the differences. (p. 21)&#13;

                       The Role of Families, Communities, and Governments in Improving Socioeconomic Performance                     21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         During those decades [1950s and 1960s] ... the Japanese government spent a far smaller&#13;
         proportion of its gross domestic product than Western counterparts on social security.... In&#13;
         [the] early 1970s, the government sponsored major expansions in health care, pensions, and&#13;
         various programs for the elderly. No sooner had it done so than the Japanese economy&#13;
         experienced the Oil Shock of 1973Â­1974, and conservative elites proclaimed the new&#13;
         imperative of reining in previous welfare commitments. By 1979, Liberal Democratic&#13;
         governments openly embraced the goal of fashioning a distinctive "Japanese-style welfare&#13;
         society," in which the state need not provide European levels of support because the family&#13;
         system and traditional communal solidarity remain strong. (p. 215)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    More quotes from Garon (1997) follow:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         As in the prewar era, leaders of the Japanese state have sought to limit expenditure on&#13;
         social programs while actively managing and coordinating "private" welfare&#13;
         mechanisms. The government, by widespread agreement, also serves as the provider of&#13;
         last resort to those who lack sufficient familial support. In a 1977 report, the Economic&#13;
         Planning Agency held out hope for the development of individual "independence and&#13;
         spontaneity in the future." But "we do not expect our country to become a Western-style&#13;
         individualistic society. It therefore is necessary to make the best use of our intermediary&#13;
         groups (chÃ¿kan shÃ¿dan), such as families and local communities, and continue to strive&#13;
         for the optimal mix of individualism and groupism." ... The Ministry of Health and&#13;
         Welfare's 1978 white paper heralded the "three-generation family" as Japan's "hidden&#13;
         asset in welfare." ... According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's 1992 survey of&#13;
         bedridden elderly, an astounding 86 percent were being nursed at home by [a] child's&#13;
         spouse (invariably a daughter-in-law), their own child, their own spouse, or another&#13;
         relative. (pp. 224Â­26)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In addition to the family, proponents of Japanese-style welfare extolled two other&#13;
         intermediary organizations--the local community and the business enterprise. As&#13;
         skeptics rightly note, the enterprise's contributions to overall welfare are limited.... The&#13;
         state's mobilization of local communities remains significant in the area of social&#13;
         services. The nearly eighty-year-old system of welfare commissioners is alive and well.&#13;
         They numbered 189,965 nationwide in 1992. Since the 1960's, welfare commissioners&#13;
         have increasingly focused on assisting the elderly. They frequently visit the homes of the&#13;
         elderly and handicapped, arrange for home helpers, and, when necessary, help place&#13;
         [people under family care] in institutions. (pp. 227Â­28)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Although the Japanese people rarely hear the term "Japanese-style welfare society" these days, the&#13;
idea remains alive in the Japanese legal system. The Japanese constitution requires the national&#13;
government to assume responsibility for maintaining a minimum standard of living for the people (Article&#13;
25). The civil code of Japan, however, clearly requires that family members support each other: "The&#13;
lineal relatives by blood and brothers and sisters shall be under duty to furnish support to each other.... If&#13;
there are special circumstances, the Family Court may impose a duty to furnish support as between the&#13;
relatives within the third degree other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph" (Article 877).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We do not agree with this assessment. First, an objection is made only regarding the roles of communities and firms, not on the roles&#13;
    of families. Second, the objection toward the welfare roles of communities is based on visible contributions to charities by U.S.&#13;
    communities, when an important welfare role for communities in Japan is mutual and voluntary assistance among neighbors. Finally,&#13;
    although it may be true that as a whole similarities with the West overshadow the differences, we believe that small differences are&#13;
    significant because they can have a great influence on outcomes.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22       Shinji Yamashige&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, the Daily Life Security Law22 states that support by the family (defined in the civil code&#13;
above) should precede any public assistance (Article 4), and that public assistance shall be determined&#13;
based on, in principle, households and not individuals (Article 10). What we can see here is the fact that&#13;
the idea of Japanese-style social policy has been embedded in the Japanese legal system.&#13;
    We can also see the same spirit, for example, in the annual report of the Ministry of Health and&#13;
Welfare (1997) which is subtitled "Families and Social Security: For the Social Support of Families." The&#13;
tone of the annual report, however, is different from that of the 1978 white paper above, because the report&#13;
now emphasizes the transformation of Japanese families after the war to convince people of the necessity&#13;
of a new social security system for Japan's aging population.&#13;
    As we see in the next section, families and communities are indeed changing in Japan. It may be&#13;
useful, however, to point out that the new welfare system proposed is not the Western-style system, but a&#13;
Japanese-style system with greater support for families and communities. It is in this sense that the idea of&#13;
a "Japanese-style welfare society" lives on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Weakening of Families and Communities in Japan&#13;
&#13;
Families and communities have been losing their strength in Japan for some time now. Let us first&#13;
examine this assertion by looking at average household size and the divorce rate in figure 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As the figure shows, average household size has been decreasing and the divorce rate has been&#13;
increasing since about the 1960s. Furthermore, figure 13 taken from SundstrÃ¶m (1994) shows that the ratio&#13;

of the elderly living with their children is also declining in Japan, just as it declines in almost every other&#13;
country.23&#13;

&#13;
    These data strongly suggest that the nature of families in Japan has been changing drastically in recent&#13;
years.24 In particular, the risk-sharing function taken on by families via a mutual-help system seems to&#13;
have deteriorated a great deal.&#13;
    Similar facts have been observed about community ties. For example, Steiner (1965) had published&#13;
the following observation more than 30 years ago:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          New and improved means of communications and transportation--down to the bicycle--&#13;
          continue to bring the outside world close to the buraku.25 Increasing industrialization&#13;
          means greater mobility for the buraku residents. Even those who continue to reside in the&#13;
          buraku are less attached to it when they continue to work in a nearby city or town, and&#13;
          when farming becomes only a part-time occupation for them. The increasing&#13;
          mechanization of agriculture makes the farmer less dependent on the cooperation of his&#13;
          neighbors. The communal forest, once the main source of fuel, is becoming less&#13;
          important as other fuel becomes available and as electric cooking and heating appliances&#13;
          find their way into farmhouses. Chemical products decrease the importance of communal&#13;
          grassland as a source of fertilizer. As the thatched roof is replaced by other types of&#13;
          roofing, the need for cooperation of the neighbors in rethatching diminishes. The&#13;
          contractor from the nearest town is also hired more frequently for road repairs that were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23  The fact that the ratio is declining almost everywhere suggests that the high ratio of the elderly living with children is not just a&#13;
    cultural preference but something that is strongly affected by other, noncultural factors.&#13;
24  The recent changes in families have been clearly recognized and discussed extensively in Japan. For example, the declining fertility&#13;
    rate and the policies to stop this trend frame one of the most frequently discussed issues in the country now. See, for example, MHW&#13;
    (1997) to witness the recent discussion in Japan.&#13;
25  Buraku is a name for neighborhood associations in rural areas of Japan.&#13;

          previously a community effort. Even the rotating bulletin board, the kairanban, may fall&#13;
          victim of the loudspeaker of the village intercommunication system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          We have noted that most observers agree that the scope of social buraku functions and&#13;
          the degree of participation in them are diminishing. Most buraku inhabitants admit that&#13;
          there is less cohesion than there used to be, and the older generation frequently&#13;
          complaints about the unrest, disobedience, and nonconformist views and practices of the&#13;
          young people. Clearly, the trend of the times is not favorable to the buraku. (p.224)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Although we do not know of any empirical work that traces the histories of a community--and thus&#13;
we are unaware of any data that statistically support our claim that ties of communities are also weakening&#13;
in Japan--Steiner's observations above and one of the administrative complaints in Ueda discussed in a&#13;
previous subsection ["A Case Study"] both suggest a weakening of communities in Japan.&#13;
     The logic expressed in the above passages from Steiner (1965) is the one described in our hypothesis&#13;
(H1), defined earlier, that attributes the weakening of community ties to market expansion. As noted&#13;
earlier, the legal ambiguity of neighborhood associations also seems to have damaged community ties, as&#13;
formal contracts prevail under the market system.&#13;
     As communities get weaker, we should expect more free-rider problems in Japan. Needless to say, a&#13;
solution to free-rider problems is to legalize the system of neighborhood associations as a social contract&#13;
among inhabitants, just as governments are legally instituted to overcome the free-rider problems in the&#13;
supply of public goods. Looking back at the histories of neighborhood associations in Japan, however, it is&#13;
quite doubtful whether such a reform would be accepted. Even if neighborhood associations are legalized,&#13;
it is still questionable whether they can induce the compulsory participation of inhabitants, which is the&#13;
key element for attaining a high level of social performance. As Steiner observed, the trend of the times is&#13;
not favorable to Japanese society.&#13;
     Figure 14, based on Ministry of Justice (1996) shows that the crime rate represented by the number of&#13;
criminal offenses (other than traffic violations) per million persons had been gradually declining in Japan&#13;
after World War II but has been increasing again since the mid-1970s. Based on the discussion on the roles&#13;
of families and communities in Japan and on their recent dissolution, it may not be too far off to suggest&#13;
that the recent criminal trend is a consequence of the weakening of families and communities. Needless to&#13;
say, we need more time and analyses to validate this view.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Concluding Remarks&#13;
&#13;
After World War II, Japan enjoyed strong economic growth in a fairly short period of time. At the same&#13;
time, the country maintained its social performance while keeping social expenditures at one of the lowest&#13;
levels among developed countries. In this paper, we argued that by studying socioeconomic histories of&#13;
Japan, one can identify strong families and communities as having played important roles in attaining high&#13;
levels of social performance--exemplified by good health, quality education, and low crime rates--while&#13;
keeping related expenses to a minimum.&#13;
     An interesting observation found in our study is that the Japanese government made active use of&#13;
these social institutions to achieve maximum performance at minimum cost. Favorable taxes and social&#13;
insurance to housewives, and the use of neighborhood associations as agencies seem to have been&#13;
strategically designed to preserve and use Japan's strong family and community structure.&#13;
     Now, after rapid economic growth, Japanese society is changing. That almost anything can be&#13;
purchased and sold under the market system that has prevailed allows each individual to be independent of&#13;
family and community. The steady increase in the divorce rate and the decrease in household size suggest&#13;

&#13;
that this is indeed the case. The expansion of the market system also has changed the social attitudes of&#13;
Japanese from a norm-based one (groupism) to a contract-based one (individualism). In this respect,&#13;
informal neighborhood associations, which used to provide safety nets, have also lost their importance to a&#13;
great extent.&#13;
    Facing these social changes in Japan, the government has been seeking new ways to cope with them.&#13;
Two recently passed laws can be seen as evidence that the government still tries to deal with the problem&#13;
of weakening families and communities within the framework of the "Japanese-style welfare society" by&#13;
providing greater support for them. First, in the new long-term care insurance system, the government has&#13;
made an effort to provide more help to those who want to take care of elderly relatives at home. Compared&#13;
with a policy to increase nursing homes, for example, this new system (which is a modification of the&#13;
German system) would allow the government to save money. Second, under the newly revised local&#13;
autonomy law, neighborhood associations can now be legal entities, which would allow them to have a&#13;
more sound foundation to play their roles in their communities. Although we do not know whether these&#13;
new policies will succeed in improving social welfare without increasing social expenditure, the attempts&#13;
seem worthy of a follow-up study.&#13;
    Looking back at Japan's socioeconomic history, we are inclined to think that the utilization of&#13;
traditional social systems such as families and communities can be a particularly effective strategy for&#13;
steady and stable socioeconomic growth. As the failure of the GHQ/SCAP policy to abolish neighborhood&#13;
associations shows, it would be nearly impossible to change the social structure in one day. Since families&#13;
and communities have long been institutions that helped improve socioeconomic performance in most&#13;
societies, the government's cooperation--if it is successful--with these institutions would induce positive&#13;
outcomes. Thus it seems useful to design development strategies which first utilize "traditional" social&#13;
systems in each country to guarantee the best possible outcome in the long run. Although nourishing&#13;
families and communities may require certain government expenditures (for example, subsidies) to&#13;
rekindle the mutual-help notion within them (especially when the market system expands), the Japanese&#13;
experience suggests that such expenses are a good risk because they would eventually allow us to reach&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the same level of social performance at a lower cost. It is our hope that our study not only sheds new light&#13;
on the socioeconomic history of Japan but also provides some insights on development strategies for other&#13;
countries in various stages of development.&#13;

            The role of families, communities, and
            governments in Improving socioeconomic performance : The
            Japanese experience
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            By tracing Japan's history, the
            paper argues that families and communities have played
            important roles in the country's successful
            socioeconomic performance. The argument is first made by
            comparing Japan's socioeconomic data with those of
            other OECD countries. Then, the paper presents some case
            studies to gain a better understanding of the roles played
            by Japanese families and communities. This does not imply,
            however, that government had a small role. On the contrary,
            the Japanese government succeeded in attaining high
            socioeconomic levels at relatively low cost by supporting
            and utilizing families &amp; communities. This may be termed
            a Japanese-style welfare policy. Finally, the paper argues
            that along with economic growth in Japan, family and
            community ties have weakened to a point at which the
            government must assume larger roles to maintain
            socioeconomic performance. This paper was prepared for a
            project on Local Government Development in Japan. The
            principal objectives of this Program are to conduct studies
            on Japanese and East Asian development management experience
            and to disseminate the lessons of this experience to
            developing and transition economies.
