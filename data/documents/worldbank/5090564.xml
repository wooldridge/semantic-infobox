                         Release ofthe Third Tranche- FullCompliance&#13;
                                           (NO.3721-RW)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          I.Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The IRC was designed to support the Government o f Rwanda's reform effort in the&#13;
implementation o f its PRSP. The main objectives o f the reform program are in line with the&#13;
PRSP, to help focus the development agenda on poverty reduction, sustain economic growth in&#13;
the range o f 6-7 percent and reduce the incidence o fpoverty from 60 percent in2000 to about 52&#13;
percent in 2004.      The medium-term actions aim to (i)      revitalize agriculture and the rural&#13;
economy, (ii)strengthen the private sector; (iii)       build human resources and (iv) improve&#13;
governance and the effectiveness, efficiency and poverty impact o f public sector actions. These&#13;
areas cover the six thematic priorities identified inthe PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The IRC builds on the progress made inreforms under the preceding Economic Recovery&#13;
Credit (ERC) and consolidates the benefits from those reforms.            The IRC focuses on: (i)&#13;
improving public expenditure management building on an ongoing public expenditure&#13;
management review, and a financial accountability review and action plan (FARAP); (ii)      private&#13;
sector development including privatization and the reform o fthe financial sector, buildingon the&#13;
work done under the ERC to prepare enterprises for privatization, and working closely with the&#13;
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) that i s providing technical&#13;
assistance for the implementation o f reforms; and (iii)    addressing gender and budget related&#13;
institutional issues in the area o f human development.          Reforms in agriculture and rural&#13;
development and other institutional reforms in the social sectors were closely monitored under&#13;
the IRC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 11. RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
3.       Following the release o f the second (fixed) tranche o f the IRC, government continued its&#13;
commitment to reform, with greater attention to measures to generate economic growth. GDP&#13;
growth continues to be maintained at just under 3% per annum. This slow down has resulted&#13;
from lower than expected agricultural output, and the current electricity shortage.             The&#13;
agriculture sector i s highly vulnerable to weather variations.     Inaddition, the manufacturing&#13;
sector has also been subject to the vagaries o f the weather, as a result o f the fall in electricity&#13;
generation power that arose from low water levels following the recent drought. The associated&#13;
electricity shortages have contributed to this development, and has impacted on the performance&#13;
o f the textiles, cement, chemicals and beverages industries. Inflation has increased significantly&#13;
since the final quarter o f 2002. Inflation excluding food prices has increased from 3.6 percent in&#13;
March 2003 to 7.3 percent inMay 2004. Inthe case o f food price inflation, this has exceeded 13&#13;
percent since 2003 and i s now estimated at 17percent. Overall, total inflationwas at 7.7 percent&#13;
at end o f 2003, and reached a high o f 12.4 percent by the end o f May 2004 before dropping to&#13;
12.3 percent at the endJune.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 - L -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.       To address the issue of growth, government has outlined an agriculture development&#13;
strategy, with emphasis on production for the market which the Bank will support through the&#13;
Rural Support Credit. Inaddition, policy and institutional measures to support the soundness o f&#13;
the financial sector (with an emphasis on micro-finance and financial intermediation), as well as&#13;
improvements in the overall business environment are being supported under the upcoming&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit.      Furthermore, an upcoming transport project, and urban&#13;
infrastructure project, and an emergency project to address the shortages inthe energy sector will&#13;
helpto reduce the hightransaction costs to doing business.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Public Finances and Expenditures. The government has made significant progress in&#13;
improving the revenue base which i s now at 13.5 percent o f GDP (compared to the levels o f&#13;
12.2% o f GDP in 2002 and 11.4% o f GDP in 2001). Given that there has already been an&#13;
increase inthe VAT to 18 percent (from 15 percent), and an improvement intax administration&#13;
during 2002-03, any further significant improvements intax revenue will have to come from an&#13;
increase in the tax base through a shift in economic activity from the informal to formal&#13;
economy. To achieve this the government has begun the articulation o f an agriculture strategy to&#13;
promote increased production for the market. In addition, the government continues to work&#13;
toward passing the land law policy which will provide an additional source o f revenue, at the&#13;
local level.&#13;
&#13;
6.       To achieve poverty reduction goals, government expenditure i s likely to increase in2005&#13;
relative to 2004. Government is considering increasing allocations to health, education, energy,&#13;
water, roads, as well as transfers to local governments. New programs to establish an export&#13;
promotion zone and plans to post-pone budget outlays for demobilizationto 2005 will all require&#13;
increased expenditures. This implies that the government's domestic fiscal deficit which i s&#13;
currently at 7.8 percent o f GDP (relative to a level o f 4.2 percent) in 2005 will remain 7.8&#13;
percent, at the minimum, and i s likelyto increase.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Given the above context, the government plans to base extemal financing on a&#13;
combination o f extemal grant and loan resources, to avoid inflationary financing. Furthermore,&#13;
to avoid the inflationary experience o f 2002-03 and ensure that spending remains in line with&#13;
assured fimding, the government has identified contingent expenditures to be reduced in the&#13;
event that additional grants are not mobilized.        To ensure consistency with sustainable&#13;
government finances and extemal debt, the government i s committed to remaining prudent in&#13;
taking on new commitments. Government may also need to re-phase expenditures to the second&#13;
halfo f the year (as it didin2004), ifuncertainties ingrant financing continue to be an issue.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Monetary and exchange rate policy. The growth rate for broadmoney slowed from 15&#13;
percent at end-December 2003 to 6.9 percent in May 2004. This slow down was a result o f a&#13;
decline inprivate sector demand for credit. While net foreign exchange inflows were higher than&#13;
expected, they were offset by movements in other items in bank balance sheets. Given these&#13;
events, coupled with a stronger than expected earnings on coffee and tin exports and the slow&#13;
down o f import demand for industrial inputs and consumer goods, the Rwandan franc/US $&#13;
exchangerate stabilized during2004.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.       Banking and Financial Sector. The problem of non-performing loans persists.&#13;
However, the recent completion o f sale for the Commercial Bank o f Rwanda (BCR) and the&#13;
 Continental Bank o f Rwanda (BACAR), at the beginning o f August 2004 should provide&#13;
 significant improvements inthe level o f soundness o f the sector-   the two banks together have&#13;
heldthe highest share o fnon-performing loans. The plannedrecapitalization o fthe Development&#13;
Bank of Rwanda (BRD) should helpto hrther strengthenfinancial intermediation. An adequate&#13;
regulatory and supervisory framework derived from a credible and focused strategy should form&#13;
part o f the approach to improving the soundness o f the sector. In this regard, the upcoming&#13;
Financial Sector Assessment will aid in the development o f a strategy and identification o f&#13;
specific andmonitorable actions.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Bankingregulationand supervision was strengthenedwith anew set ofregulations at end&#13;
o f 2003. Three new regulations raised the solvency ratio from 8 to 10 percent and improved the&#13;
definition o f credit concentration and asset quality. Furthermore, there hasbeengreater prudence&#13;
in the assessment of loan guarantees as an effort to improve loan recovery. However, loan&#13;
recovery remains a lengthy process and continued reform i s needed, notably with respect to the&#13;
judicial system. Steps have also been taken to improve regulation o f micro-finance and&#13;
cooperative institutions.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Despite the improvements inregulation and supervision, there continues to be a problem&#13;
with compliance with banking regulation. In order to improve compliance by banks on risk&#13;
concentration limits, most banks have elaborated action plans to address the problem. However,&#13;
the bank holding the second largest deposits, appears to be confronting exceptional problems and&#13;
has consistently failed to comply with a large number o f bankingregulations. An actionplan for&#13;
returning to regulatory compliance on its solvency ratio, risk concentration and limits, liquidity&#13;
ratios and net foreign exchange positions has been recently agreed between BNR and BCR&#13;
management and i s beingimplemented.As a result, the situationi s improving.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Balance of Payments and ExternalDebt. There appears to be a modest improvement&#13;
in2004 to 19.6percent (compared to the earlier estimated level of 19.8 percent, in2004). Coffee&#13;
export volumes appeared to have increased substantially, while international market prices have&#13;
recovered from last year's lows, as a result o f poor harvest inBrazil. There was also an increase&#13;
in the world market for tin which doubled the projected level o f exports. However, export&#13;
performance inthe tea andnon-traditional export sectors remainweak.&#13;
&#13;
13.     External debt steadied in 2003. But, preliminary estimates indicate that the net present&#13;
value (NPV) o f debt-to-exports rose to 315 percent as o f end-2003, after the enhanced HIPC&#13;
Initiative relief. This deterioration in the NPV i s mainly due to the impact o f a change in the&#13;
discount and exchange rates-more         so than the weaker-than-expected export performance.&#13;
However, the ratio i s projectedto increase to 340 percent in2004 givenprojectednew borrowing&#13;
(US$ 45 million), and a year-on-year growth rate o f goods and services exports that exceeds 20&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
14.     StructuralReforms. The government continues to adhere to its reforms program. The&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 4 -&#13;
&#13;
Organic Budget Law was approved by the Cabinet in June 2004 and submitted to parliament in&#13;
late-July 2004. The government has also initiated implementation o f financial instructions to&#13;
support the new budget law; and has also begun the process to submit new tax and customs&#13;
legislation, along with a revisedinvestmentcode, to parliamentfor consideration.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Inaddition, the Auditor General's 2002 report was submitted to parliament inFebruary&#13;
2004, and the 2003 report will be submitted in October 2004. There i s also the anticipated&#13;
approval o f the Auditor General's Act which will add to this achievement. Looking forward, the&#13;
proposed increased funding to local governments, and to the overall decentralization process will&#13;
require improvement in financial administration, including establishment o f monthly reporting&#13;
mechanisms. Furthermore, the government will soon introduce the SIBET 2 (end-2004)-an&#13;
updated version o f the SIBET (the government's project finance and expenditure management&#13;
software) which will incorporate all key departments in the Ministry o f Finance along with the&#13;
sector ministries. Steps will also be taken to follow-up on the closing o f dormant government&#13;
accounts, and publication o f monthly reconciliation accounts for government financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The privatization agenda has taken a major step forward with the privatization o f BCR&#13;
and BACAR and the sale o f the Pfunda tea factory. Government had also reached the point of&#13;
sale (see footnote 1, below) with Mulinditea factory. However, government could not reach an&#13;
agreement on terms that it felt would benefit the sector and industry. As a result, the contract&#13;
negotiations were terminated. A new schedule for the sale o f the factory has been established,&#13;
and government i s moving ahead with the scheduled privatization o f the next set o f 4 tea&#13;
factories. Actions to complete privatization o f the tea sector, and inparticular another tea factory&#13;
prior to the HIPC decision point document should proceed promptly. Inaddition, government&#13;
shares inRwandatel, Rwandex, and PrimeHoldings are scheduled to beprivatized quickly.&#13;
&#13;
17.     The authorities are also committed to civil service reform and are receiving technical&#13;
assistance from DFID inthis regard. The Bank i s providing support to capacity buildingthrough&#13;
the Public Sector Capacity Building Project. As the reform could have a substantial impact on&#13;
the government's ability to implement its operations, a prudent course, in consultation with&#13;
partnerswill needto bepursued.&#13;

18.      The macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower is satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, as measured on the basis of indicators agreed between the Borrower and the&#13;
Association.&#13;
&#13;
   0   The Borrower has met this condition. Despite external shocks as noted above to the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
        macro economy, the macro program continues to be on track.&#13;
&#13;
    0   To contain future increases in expenditures, the recently agreed 2004 PRGF program&#13;
        includes a substantial reduction in net credit to government from the banking system,&#13;
        slower reserve money growth, and a fiscal program that incorporates contingent cuts to&#13;
        assure the domestic fiscal balance remains consistent with macro-economic objectives.&#13;
        By January-April 2004, payment orders had been issued to eliminate the stock of&#13;
        domestic arrears that had accumulated at the end o f 2003. As o f April 30, 2004, net&#13;
        central bank credit to government was below projected requirements, reserve money&#13;
        growth was lower and net foreign assets o f the NBR were higher than targeted.     As a&#13;
       result o f this progress, the IMF Board concluded the second and third reviews o f the&#13;
       PRGF, and approved the disbursement of additional interim assistance under the HPC&#13;
       Initiative, on June 9, 2004. Subject to continued satisfactory progress inthe program, the&#13;
       next review is scheduled for November-December 2004. Prior to this, the FundBoard&#13;
       will consider a 2004 Article N consultation in September 2004. It is expected that with&#13;
       continued satisfactory macro-economic performance, following the fourth review under&#13;
       the PRGF arrangement, Rwanda should reach the HPC Completion Point by December&#13;
       2004.&#13;
&#13;
19.      TheBorrower has achievedprogresssatisfactory to theAssociation in the carrying out&#13;
of the Program.&#13;
&#13;
    0  The Borrower has met this condition. The Government has been implementingpolicies to&#13;
       achieve medium-term economic growth and poverty reduction goals and to make&#13;
       progress on institutionalreforms to improve govemance, effectiveness o fthe government,&#13;
       enhance human resource development and promote private sector development.&#13;
       Implementation o f the PRSP started in mid-2002. InJune 2003, a PRS progress report&#13;
       was produced. Budget allocations have been increased in the 2002, 2003 and 2004&#13;
       budgets for priority sectors identified in the PRSP. A more detailed assessment of&#13;
       progress i s outlined inthe Annex.&#13;
&#13;
B. Specific Conditionsfor Releaseof the Third Tranche&#13;
&#13;
20.      The Borrower achieved progress satisfactory to the Association in implementing the&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding, as described inparagraph 54 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
       The Borrower has met this condition. Many steps have been taken by the BNR to&#13;
       improve the health o f the financial sector. Supervisors o f the BNR conducted audits o f&#13;
       three banks in the second half o f 2002. As a result o f these audits, the BNR placed&#13;
       restrictions on the operations o f two commercial banks. Inaddition, BNR's supervision&#13;
       has been extended to micro-finance operations.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Loan recovery performance has also improved. Procedures that accelerate loan recovery&#13;
       (voie paree) were reinstated in December 2001, and many administrative constraints&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  - 6 -&#13;
&#13;
        have beenresolved. The City o f Kigalihas dramatically improved the process o f property&#13;
        registration by creating a special unit dedicated to that job. Banks contributed to the&#13;
         initial funding for this exercise, inorder to improve the availability o f collateral for loans.&#13;
         These measures substantially improved recovery performance in 2002. (See also&#13;
         condition 3 below).&#13;
&#13;
     0   In December 2003, the National Bank of Rwanda published its loans accounting and&#13;
        underwriting standards. Banks were mandated to comply with these conditions as o f&#13;
        January 2004.       In addition, measures to strengthen the Arbitration Center were&#13;
        undertaken. Computer equipment, vehicle and'sofhvare were provided. The Center has&#13;
        identifiedandpublisheda list o f experts on arbitration available for the public. It has also&#13;
        organized seminars to promote public awareness about arbitration and the role o f the&#13;
         Center. A training program for arbitrators and the administrative personnel i s also&#13;
        planned.&#13;
&#13;
     0  Finally, commercial chambers were established, along with the necessary infrastructure&#13;
        and recruitment of new bailiffs and notaries. Promulgation of the judicial reform law&#13;
        occurred on April 25, 2004 (Law No. 07/2004). The law determines the organization,&#13;
        functioning and jurisdiction o f courts in Rwanda, and covers the jurisdiction o f&#13;
        Commercial, Financial and Tax Courts. Three commercial chambers have been created&#13;
        based on guidelines o f the law, andjudges are being trained to beginhearing cases under&#13;
        the new commercial chambers system.&#13;
&#13;
     0  A financial sector assessment is planned for the last quarter of 2004, (to be done jointly&#13;
        between the IMF and the Bank) which will help the government identifj further measures&#13;
        to deepenongoing reforms.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The Borrowerfor thepurpose of restructuring and divestiture of BCR, made adequate&#13;
provision in its budgetfor FY 2003, to the satisfaction of the Association, in accordance with&#13;
paragraph 55 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
     0  The Borrower has met this condition . Following the vote by the Board o f Directors of&#13;
        BCR to increase capital to the bank by FRw 5 Billion, the Govemment allocated FRw 5&#13;
        billion, during the 2003 budget exercise toward the restructuring of BCR. FRwl.3&#13;
        billion was issued in cash; the remaining amount to be paid will be revised soon, given&#13;
        the highprofits realized during the last two years which resulted inthe reduction o f the&#13;
        negative networth of BCR from FRw 7 billion in2002 to about FRw 1billion duringthe&#13;
        second quarter o f 2004. Severance obligations to staffwere met in2002.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The Borrower has caused BNR to: (i) direct all commercial banks that the monthly&#13;
listing report made to BNR shall reflect separately non-performing borrowers; (ii) make&#13;
available to the commercial banks, the listing report within 30 days offiling; (iii) maintain the&#13;
listing report in a centralized database and make it accessible to credit information or rating&#13;
companies and commercial banks; (iv) prohibit commercial banks from making loans or&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                             - 7 -&#13;
&#13;
 advancing any monies to non-performing borrowers, exceptfor the purpose of repayment of&#13;
 loans in default on other banks, all to the satisfaction of the Association and in accordance&#13;
 withparagraph 56 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
          The Borrower has met this condition. BNR has continued to improve bank supervision&#13;
          and it now produces detailed statistical data, both inpaper and in electronic form, on all&#13;
          commercial banks. Since 2002 the Banker's Association has shared the list of all&#13;
          defaulting borrowers, which i s available to all commercial banks.                          Furthermore, in&#13;
          December 2003, to formalize the practice, BNR issued an instruction directing banks to&#13;
          provide a monthly listing report that accounts separately for non-performing borrowers;&#13;
          the listing report i s maintainedina central database and i s made available to commercial&#13;
          bankswithin 30 days o f filing. The same instructionprevents banks from lendingto these&#13;
          defaulters. As planned, BNR has established a supervision department for the micro-&#13;
          finance sector, which currently has four inspectors.&#13;
&#13;
23.       The Borrower brought to the point of sale at least 80percent of its shares in BCR to&#13;
qualified buyers or effected divestiture of BCR through the implementation of a back-upplan,&#13;
satisfactory to theAssociation, in accordancewithparagraph 55 of the LDP'.&#13;
&#13;
     0    The Borrower has met this condition. BCR management took actions to reduce operating&#13;
          costs (as stipulated in the Memorandum o f Understanding with BNR), and improve&#13;
          collections o f non-performing loans which led to small profits beginning end 2002.&#13;
          However, some technicalities led to a delay inthe privatizationprocess, after the decision&#13;
          by the strategic shareholder Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) to terminate operations in&#13;
          Africa. A subsequent arrangement by BBL to sell its shares to a private company was&#13;
          vetoed by the regulator, Banque National du Rwanda (BNR). The privatization process&#13;
          was therefore delayed untilthese issues were settled.&#13;
&#13;
     0    In March 2004, the Government issued invitations to potential investors, to begin due&#13;
          diligence procedures. Four banks expressed interest, with at least one o f the potential&#13;
         bidders seeking to achieve a minimum 30% market share and a minimum level o f&#13;
          profitability, which cannot be achieved through the purchase o f BCR alone.                                 To&#13;
          accommodate bidders who sought to maximize their market share and profits, the&#13;
          government encouraged potential bidders to explore the possibility o f purchasing another&#13;
         bank that was to be privatized (BACAR), in addition to BCR. Negotiations for the sale&#13;
          o f BCR were completed in July 2004, along with the sale o f BACAR. Government has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Note that for the purposes of subparagraph (d) o fparagraph 55, inthe Development Credit Agreement hereto, the&#13;
term "brought to the point o f sale" means: (i) an evaluation o fthe stocks o f BCR, on the basis, inter alia, o f&#13;
                                                 carried&#13;
an evaluation o f its assets and liabilities; (ii)&#13;
                                                prepared a prospectus for distribution to prospective buyers; (iii)&#13;
solicited offers for the purchase o f share capital; (iv) evaluated any such offers and selected successful bidders; and&#13;

&#13;
        Progressin Achieving Measures Specifiedinthe Letter of DevelopmentPolicy&#13;
&#13;
 1.     Overall, progress in targets and policy measures contained inthe Letter o f Development&#13;
Policy has been satisfactory. Progress has been made in various areas-trade           and exchange&#13;
regime, financial sector, agricultural policies, privatization, budget reform, and public&#13;
administration reform. There have also been activities in the areas o f the legal environment for&#13;
enhanced good governance, privatization o f public enterprises, budget and public administration&#13;
reform, and financial restructuring andreform. A Comprehensive Action Planfor the Elimination&#13;
o f all Discrimination Against Women (Legal Action Plan) has been prepared and approved by&#13;
the Cabinet o f Ministers. This complements the anti-discrimination law passed inOctober 2001&#13;
by Rwanda's Transitional Assembly, which punishes "any act, utterance or writing aimed at&#13;
depriving a person or group o f persons, their rights, by reason o f sex, ethnicity, age, race, color,&#13;
opinion, religionnationalityor origin."&#13;
&#13;
2.      A summary ofprogress according to the main broad areas of the Letter of Development&#13;
Policy are outlined below: i)Public Expenditure Management; ii)Public Service Reform; iii)&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development; iv) HumanResource Development/Social Sector Reform;&#13;
and v) Private Sector Development and Employment Creation.&#13;
&#13;
                              1. PublicExpenditureManagement&#13;
&#13;
3.      The policy o f protecting social sector budget allocations from cuts during the course o f&#13;
the fiscal year, adopted in 1999,has continuedto be followed. Inaddition, military expenditures&#13;
have progressively been reduced to release resources for priority development programs. As&#13;
mentioned above an important change that has occurred pertains to budget presentation. Since&#13;
the 2002 budget cycle, all expenditures have been classified according to programs and sub-&#13;
programs, expected outputs, activities and inputs, inall ministries.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The sensitization o f stakeholders and the emphasis on training o f staff in core and line&#13;
ministries has facilitated the introduction o f the MTEF. Districts are now receiving training in&#13;
budget preparation using the MTEF approach. However, more work i s required in defining and&#13;
linking spending ceilings to district development plans, to ensure appropriate costing, given the&#13;
available resources.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Ingeneral, achievements inpublic expendituremanagement includeimprovements to the&#13;
cash management system, computerizationo f the budget andbudgetreporting, the preparation o f&#13;
an organic budget law, further strengtheningo f the Auditor General's Office, and the issuance o f&#13;
guidelines for opening, closing, and monitoring government bank accounts. In 2002, the office&#13;
o f Auditor General conducted audit missions o f 10 ministries, including defense, and 13 projects.&#13;
Professional audit standards were set in place, and a new Auditor General Act was drafted. In&#13;
addition, a new Division o f Public Accounts was set up in the Ministry o f Economic Planning&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 - 10-&#13;
&#13;
and Finance to develop accounting structures and systems in line with the medium term&#13;
expenditureframework (MTEF) andthe budget.&#13;
6.       The next stage o f reforms (to be covered under the PRSC), will continue the&#13;
implementation o f the FARAP, and the strengthening o f reporting and auditing mechanisms at&#13;
district levels, with a focus on integrationo f the development budget and the recurrent budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              2. Agriculture andRuralDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
7.       In general, the sector has experienced declining factor productivity as a result of&#13;
inadequate investment and research into appropriate technology.        The effects o f inadequate&#13;
investment has been particularly apparent in the export crop sector. In addition, for the main&#13;
export crops o f coffee and tea, declining international prices has provided an incentive for&#13;
farmers to move into more high value, horticultural crops such as passion fruit. Coupled with&#13;
these events, during the 2003 growing season, drought affected the level o f production, leadingto&#13;
higher food prices and inflation. These events, coupled with high oil prices have also led to&#13;
higherproductioncosts andtherefore lower returns to farmers.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Giventhe above factors, the government recognizes theneedto redouble effort inthis key&#13;
area o f the PRSP to ensure improved productivity, and increased returns to farmers. To this end,&#13;
the govemment's strategy is focused on: (i)intensification, through increased utilization of&#13;
agricultural inputs and cultural practices, and improved research; (ii)diversification toward high&#13;
value crops and non-traditional export crops, and measures to enhance competitiveness and&#13;
quality o f Rwandan tea and coffee; (iii)improved natural resource management, which has&#13;
increased in importance particularly following the genocide, and has led to complex sequences&#13;
o f landoccupation and competing claims on land.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Proper resolution o f tenure disputes i s key to promoting long-term productive&#13;
investments in agriculture. The draft landpolicy has already been debated by cabinet andwill be&#13;
submitted to Parliament in 2004. In addition, the government will need to elaborate a master&#13;
plan for land utilization and management with a focus on appropriate technologies and practices&#13;
for naturalresources protectionand management. An environmentalagency has been established&#13;
to elaborate policies for protecting the environment, limiting the effect o f weather shocks and&#13;
improving sustainability.      Finally, to improve opportunities for rural non-fann income&#13;
generation, the government will need to provide the enabling environment for identification and&#13;
diffusion o f existing potential in rural areas and empower communities with the resources and&#13;
capacity building support, including cooperatives to diversify their income sources. The Bank i s&#13;
supporting the government inthis effort through the Rural Support Credit, and the PRSC.&#13;
&#13;
10.     In the case of export led growth, the government is emphasizing improved exports for&#13;
coffee and tea. An inter-ministerial Export Promotion Commission has been established, to be&#13;
chaired by the Ministry o f Commerce.        The action plan i s to take an integrated approach&#13;
recognizing the importance o f addressing constraints all along the production, and marketing&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 11-&#13;
&#13;
chain. The government will produce a technical assessment for the Integrated Framework for&#13;
Trade; and the Bankwill support the government inthis process.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     The nationalplans for coffee and tea foresee a four to five fold growthinexport revenues&#13;
from these two sub-sectors by 2010. These are ambitious targets and much depends on world&#13;
market conditions for coffee, how well the privatization o f the tea sub-sector proceeds, and how&#13;
effectively government can implement the institutional and policy reforms necessary to increase&#13;
production. However, even more modest growth inthese two industrieswill make a substantial&#13;
improvement in aggregate and per hectare income to farmers and processing plant workers.&#13;
There i s a similar degree o f optimism about potential income and employment increases from&#13;
pyrethruminthe Ruhengeriarea.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Inaddition to the above measures, the recently launched HIM0 public works program&#13;
will help address the pressingproblemof infrastructure development andrehabilitation, and non-&#13;
farm rural employment and income generation. This intervention i s aimed at both building&#13;
infrastructure inaddition to providing temporary employment, and non-farm income for the rural&#13;
population. In the water and energy sectors, there i s a need to define key priority activities to&#13;
improve access to services while also feeding into improved income generation.        Inparticular,&#13;
issues o f water supply for rural production, sanitation and water for health, and rural&#13;
electrification, development o f alternative energy sources should be among the key components&#13;
o f a comprehensive infrastructure strategy, and will form part o f the policy dialogue under the&#13;
PRSC.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Other upcomingreforms will focus on institutionalizing an export promotion strategy and&#13;
action plan, and establishing the corresponding institutional and regulatory framework. Specific&#13;
reforms for each commodity will continue. In particular, reforms will continue with the&#13;
privatization o f remaining tea factories, building on the lessons learned from privatization o f&#13;
Mulindi and Pfunda tea factories.       In addition, the role of OCIR-thC as regulator will be&#13;
reassessedand tailored to the new policy environment.&#13;
&#13;
                    3. HumanResourcesDevelopment/SocialSector Reform&#13;
&#13;
14.      The GoR has made great strides inthe educationsector interms o f improvedenrollment&#13;
rates which are now estimated at 82%. Government has also decided on the following new policy&#13;
measures: i)free primary education for first 9 years o f basic education; ii)trilingual language&#13;
policy; iii)subsidy o f private schools to promote girls' education. There i s also the additional&#13;
challenge to improve quality . Educationaccounts for 25% o f government's total current budget&#13;
(net o f debt payment). Yet, there i s still a funding gap. The focus under the PRSC will be&#13;
prioritize the areas for reform (with attention to increased quality), and the corresponding policy&#13;
trade-offs, within the sector.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The healthsector is dynamic becauseo f the system o fwell developed NGOs anchored in&#13;
grassroots activities, focused on co-financing with strong community involvement. There i s also&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 - 12-&#13;
&#13;
 a micro-insurance program that serves 500,000 beneficiaries.          Progress has been made in&#13;
 reducing the incidence o f communicable diseases such as malaria and childhood diseases, and&#13;
 the percentage of births attended by qualified health personnel has increased by 3 percentage&#13;
points. In the case o f HIV/AIDS, a multi-sectoral approach has been adopted. The main&#13;
 challenge remaining i s to address the issue o f why malaria i s still the number one cause o f&#13;
morbidity and mortality. Even though community involvement and co-financing i s strong, there&#13;
 i s a need for increased resources to the health sector. The PRSC will also cover key reforms in&#13;
the healthsector.&#13;
&#13;
 16.     In the case of gender and budget related institutional issues, in the area of human&#13;
development, a Gender Action Plan (2001-2005) was adopted by Cabinet in 2000, and i s&#13;
currently under implementation. Inaddition, a Comprehensive Gender Action Plan to eliminate&#13;
gender disparities in the law was also prepared, and adopted in 2003.              Capacity building&#13;
involving the Government and NGOs i s underway for the implementation o f the Legal Action&#13;
Plan. Recent implementation activity has involved the assurance o f gender sensitive reforms o f&#13;
the Constitution, the Landlaw and the anti-discrimination law adopted by the National Assembly&#13;
inOctober 2001outlawingdiscriminationagainst anybody, "whether basedon ethnicity, color of&#13;
the skin, physical features, origin, sex, opinions, religions"(Law No 47/200 1).&#13;
&#13;
                    4. Private Sector Development and Employment Creation&#13;
&#13;
 17.     Considerable progress has beenmade inprivate sector development (PSD) inthe form&#13;
o f privatization and support to medium and small enterprises.          Out o f 77 companies to be&#13;
privatized 50 have already been sold. In addition, a center to cater to the development o f small&#13;
and medium enterprises was restructured into a non-profit and i s now fully operational in 2003.&#13;
There are also ongoing reforms and privatization in the tea sector. The current PSIA o f these&#13;
reforms indicate the potential for high benefits to the sector provided key structural issues&#13;
pertaining to farmers' access to credit and inputs (fertilizer, seeds, pesticides) are improved. The&#13;
PSIA also suggests that the quality o f tea has declined as a result o f the change in OCIR-th6's&#13;
role fiom one o f subsidizing input markes and marketing functions, to one o f regulator. To&#13;
ensure the growth foreseen does occur, government will need to move quickly to redefine the&#13;
role o f OCIR-th6 inits new capacity as regulator.&#13;
&#13;
18.      With the support o f the Bank, the Government prepared and adopted policies and&#13;
strategies for the privatization of Rwandatel (the telephone monopoly), and the nine publicly&#13;
owned tea factories. The legislation for the regulation o f the telecommunication sector was&#13;
passed in 2001. A Multi-sector regulatory agency became operational in October 2002 and the&#13;
call for bids for privatization o f Rwandatel has been launched. A planto restructure Electrogaz,&#13;
the energy/water utility, has been adopted, and the private operator for Electrogaz was selected&#13;
and has been inplace since October 2003.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Inthe financial and bankingsector, as of end September 2003, total loans outstanding&#13;
had increased by 8.5% since year-end 2002, with non-performing loans (NPLs) at 29.9% o f the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 13 -&#13;
&#13;
total loan portfolio, down somewhat from earlier years. An inter-bank commission had&#13;
previously looked into the NPLproblem duringthe second half of 2002, andhadmade a number&#13;
o f concrete recommendations to deal with the existing problems to mitigate future portfolio&#13;
problems. Although progress on these measures have been slow, a number o f measures were&#13;
taken by the banks or Banque Nationale du Rwanda (BNR), which resulted in significant&#13;
improvement inrecoveries. Inthe case of the Union Banque Populaire (a cooperative o f micro-&#13;
finance institutions), non-performing loans have steadily decreased and stand now at 20%&#13;
overall, with 13% at the group bank level and 66% at the Unionlevel. While these figures remain&#13;
high, they represent a significant improvement over past levels. An additional step, recently&#13;
undertaken by government was to initiate the development of a database on micro-finance&#13;
borrowers, and the registrationof micro-finance institutions with the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
20.     The government has also made a commitment to privatize the commercialbank, Banque&#13;
Commerciale Rwandaise (BCR), whose portfolio o f NPLs accounts for 25% o f all NPLs in the&#13;
sector. GoR i s committed to a successful sale to a strong buyer that will not only improve&#13;
operation of the bank, but also contribute toward strengthening the whole sector.      Interested&#13;
bidders have begun their due diligence, and the privatization o f BCR to be completed by end-&#13;
June 2004.&#13;
&#13;
                         5. ImprovingGovernance and Transparency&#13;
&#13;
21.     There has been significant progress inthe area o f political and economic governance.&#13;
The constitution was capped by a referendum in May 2003. Parliamentary and presidential&#13;
elections took place betweenAugust and October 2003, There i s an ongoing review o f all laws,&#13;
and the crime rate has declined by 20% as a result o f community sensitization. Although&#13;
somewhat behind schedule, good progress has been made in the area o f demobilization and re-&#13;
integration into civilian life, o f forces from DRC.       The unity and national reconciliation&#13;
commission continues to progress with its work, while the human rights commission has already&#13;
publishedits annual report, and has opened offices in all the major provinces. The next step,&#13;
following adoption o f the new constitution i s to develop indicators for humanrights monitoring.&#13;
Inline with this, new organigrams of civil servants in central government line ministries are&#13;
being implemented.      Roughly 509 members were redeployed to decentralized units o f&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
22.        Existing institutions for donor harmonization and support will need to be&#13;
strengthened for improved implementation o f the PRSP. Currently, the cluster thematic groups,&#13;
whose objectives have been to facilitate the development and implementation o f sector strategies&#13;
have played a major role in harmonization. These clusters are arranged around the main themes&#13;
contained in the PRSP and meet on a regular basis, with the aim to harmonize donor support&#13;
around government priorities. The rate o f progress has varied across clusters and sector themes.&#13;
There has been significant progress in the education and HIV/AIDS cluster. In the case o f&#13;
education, the existence o f a SWAP has played a major role in promoting participation and&#13;
coordination among donors, in addition to providing a coherent vision o f the sector. A SWAP i s&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 14-&#13;
&#13;
also plannedfor the health sector. Progress has been slower than plannedin other sectors due to&#13;
limitedcapacity insome ministries&#13;
&#13;
23.      In terms of budget support, a Partnership Framework agreement was recently reached&#13;
between key budget support donors and GoR. This agreement on budget support harmonization&#13;
focuses on the key areas o f public financial management, macro economic policy and PRSP&#13;
monitoring. This framework will form the basis for harmonizationo f budget support, ingeneral&#13;
and in the context o f the upcoming PRSC. The main goals of the Framework are to ensure&#13;
flexibility, reliability and timeliness o f budget support, and to streamline donor requirements&#13;
while aligning support to the PRSP review andbudgetcycle.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Institutional Reform Credit Project
            builds on the progress made in reforms under the preceding
            Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), and consolidates the
            benefits from those reforms. Despite de Government's
            continued commitments to reform, GDP growth remains at just
            under 3 percent per annum, a slow down that resulted from
            lower than expected agricultural output, and the current
            electricity shortage. The report outlines problems in public
            finance, and in the monetary policy, affecting the banking
            and financial sector. However, conditions for the release of
            the third tranche have been met, thus, in view of the
            overall performance and progress with the implementation of
            the program supported by the Credit, and in full compliance
            with the specific conditions of release in accordance to the
            Credit Agreement, availability of the third (floating)
            tranche is released.
