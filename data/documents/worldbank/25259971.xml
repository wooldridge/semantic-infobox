Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation&#13;
in the Philippines&#13;
Turning Finance into&#13;
Services for the Future&#13;
&amp;#12;This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, non-&#13;
government organizations and private sector. The core team of the National Economic Development Agency (NEDA) has&#13;
been a key partner with the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank in facilitating the Service Delivery Assessment.&#13;
The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions of all other agencies that participated, specifically the Department&#13;
of Budget and Management, Department of Health, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Public&#13;
Works and Highways, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of&#13;
the Philippines, Local Water Utilities Administration, Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, the National Water&#13;
Resources Board as well as other government agencies, development partners and international and local NGOs active in&#13;
the sector.&#13;
&#13;
The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The&#13;
following World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process&#13;
and report: Rosario Aurora L. Villaluna and U-Primo E. Rodriguez, Edkarl Galing, Aileen Castro, and Almud Weitz. Thanks go&#13;
to World Bank staff Sudipto Sarkar, Sector Leader, and Ousmane Dione, Practice Manager, who peer reviewed the report.&#13;
&#13;
The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WaÂ­    ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This&#13;
                                                                                                                      ed&#13;
regional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conductÂ­&#13;
in more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to asÂ­        sess the&#13;
adequacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service deÂ­    livery pathways.&#13;
SDAâ&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for&#13;
                                                                                                nance is effectively turned into&#13;
infrastructure and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fiÂ­&#13;
accelerated and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Global Practice,&#13;
supporting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
donors include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands,&#13;

&amp;#12;Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data from the UNICEF-WHO Joint Monitoring Programme                             reduce the costs associated with water- and sanitation-&#13;
indicate that the Philippines is on track to meet its                           related illness, malnutrition and losses in productivity.&#13;
Millennium Development Goal targets for water supply&#13;
and sanitation.1 However, with a population of more than                        To achieve government targets for 2025 for water supply,&#13;
94 million in 2011, there are still some 7.5 million Filipinos                  the additional population requiring access is estimated at&#13;
without access to improved water supply facilities and 24                       2.75 million per year with a total investment requirement of&#13;
million without access to improved sanitation. Roughly 8.3                      US$838 million per year. For sanitation to achieve universal&#13;
million people still defecate in the open and just 3% are                       coverage by 2028, the additional population requiring&#13;
connected to centralized sewerage systems.                                      access annually is estimated at 3.0 million with a total&#13;
                                                                                investment requirement of US$619 million per year.&#13;
Sector stakeholders are looking beyond the MDG attainment,&#13;
and sector roadmaps for water supply and sanitation set                         The obstacles to achieving universal, sustainable access&#13;
out a vision of universal coverage by 2025 for water supply2                    to improved water supply and sanitation services are&#13;
and 2028 for sanitation.3 Furthermore, the Department of                        primarily institutional and financial in nature. In particular,&#13;
Health National Sanitation Policy issued in 2009 calls for zero                 the sector has suffered from a lack of leadership and poor&#13;
open defecation in all barangays4 by 2022. Without political                    co-ordination among the many agencies involved in service&#13;
commitment, improved institutional arrangements, increased                      provision. Until recently there has been no designated lead&#13;
funding for the sector and the adoption of viable operational                   agency for the sector, which complicates planning and&#13;
strategies that emphasize sustainable user outcomes and                         operations. Regulation remains fragmented and is generally&#13;
equity, it is unlikely that these ambitious targets will be met.                weak, except in the case of the large concessions in Manila,&#13;
                                                                                government-owned water utilities (districts) and for some&#13;
To achieve the countryâ&#128;&#153;s vision of inclusive growth and                         private utilities/associations that have a license. In particular,&#13;
poverty reduction,5 improved water supply and sanitation                        local governments, who self-regulate their own water&#13;
services are essential. In urban growth centers, reliable                       systems, are not held accountable for meeting performance&#13;
access to adequate water for domestic, commercial and                           targets either in terms of service quality or coverage. The&#13;
other uses is vital to sustain economic activities. For the                     limited capacity of many local service providers contributes&#13;
country as a whole, sustainable access to adequate water                        to the problem to sustain and expand service beyond the&#13;
and sanitation services is needed to protect health and                         urbanised center of municipalities and cities.&#13;

underserved poor. Only the urban water supply sub-sector              sector. It intends to a) clarify leadership and coordination&#13;
enjoys a near-adequate level of funding, but the bulk of the          through appointing a lead department for the water and&#13;

Water and sanitation Service Delivery Assessments (SDAs)                       development, planning new undertakings, budgeting), three&#13;
are being carried out in seven countries in East Asia and the                  actions that relate to developing the service (expenditure of&#13;
Pacific region under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water                    funds, equity in the use of these funds, service output), and&#13;

in more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and                        and is scored from 0 to 3 accordingly. The scorecard uses a&#13;

Coverage: Assessing Past Progress&#13;
&#13;
The 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey                                urban population (84%) compared to rural population (53%).&#13;
(NDHS) of the National Statistics Office (NSO, 2009, JMP,                      Open defecation was close to four times more prevalent in&#13;
2012a and 2012b) found that about 90% of the Philippine                        rural areas (15%) than in urban areas (4%).&#13;
population had access to improved water supply. Based on&#13;
the survey, common sources of improved drinking water                          The JMP (2013) calculated that 74% of the Philippine&#13;
were piped water into dwelling/yard/plot (30%) and tube                        population has access to improved sanitation facilities. As&#13;
wells or boreholes (22%). Access to improved water supply                      with the NDHS, JMP estimates also reflect higher access&#13;
sources in urban areas (94%) was higher compared to rural                      rates to improved facilities in urban areas (79%) compared&#13;
areas (86%). Access to piped water into dwelling/yard/plot                     to rural areas (69%) in 2011.&#13;
among the urban population (38%) was also nearly two&#13;
times higher than their counterparts in rural areas (22%).                     Figure 2.1 shows that based on JMP and government&#13;
                                                                               (NDHS) estimates, access to improved water supply and&#13;
Estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of                         sanitation has increased over time. Owing to different&#13;
the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF are not                         methodologies, the increases in the access rates for water&#13;
very different from the results of the NDHS 2009. The JMP                      supply with the government estimates are smaller than the&#13;
(2013) shows that access to improved water supply for                          JMP estimates. In the case of sanitation, changes in access&#13;
2011 was about 92%. However, it indicates a narrower gap                       rates do not vary too much but government estimates are&#13;
in access to improved water supply between urban (93%)                         higher than JMP estimates due to the treatment of shared&#13;
and rural (92%) areas for the same period.                                     facilities as improved.&#13;
&#13;
The 2008 NDHS also found that about 68% of the Philippine                      The Philippines is on its way to attaining the Millennium&#13;
population had access to improved sanitation facilities.                       Development Goals targets for water supply and sanitation&#13;
This rises to about 86% if one includes shared facilities as                   in 2015.10 However, the target of universal access by 2025,&#13;
improved.9 Pour-flush toilets to septic tanks (68% of the total                which is expressed in the Philippine Water Supply Sector&#13;
population) were the dominant facility and access to sewer                     Roadmap (NEDA, 2010), seems out of reach if present&#13;
facilities remained very low (3%). An estimated 10% of the                     trends continue. The target of universal access by 2028,&#13;
population practiced open defecation. Access to improved                       which is expressed in the Philippine Sanitation Roadmap&#13;
sanitation facilities (including shared facilities) was much                   (DOH, 2009), seems attainable if current trends continue&#13;
higher in urban areas (94%) compared to rural areas (79%).                     and if shared facilities are included in the definition of â&#128;&#152;safe&#13;
Access to septic tanks was also more common among the                          and adequate sanitationâ&#128;&#153;. 	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 The JMP does not count shared toilets as improved facilities.&#13;
10&#13;
  The MDGs for water supply and sanitation state that by 2015, the country would halve the proportion of its 1990 population who did not have sustainable&#13;
access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation facilities, respectively 93% for improved source of water supply and 79% for improved sanitation.&#13;

   The details are provided in succeeding chapters. Also note that planned capital expenditures of Maynilad and Manila Water are tentative. The values are still&#13;
being reviewed and subject to the approval of the regulatory office of the Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).&#13;

   A similar situation could also occur if the MWSS substantially reduces the planned capital expenditures of Maynilad and Manila Water.&#13;

&amp;#12;Figure 2.2 indicates that anticipated investments (excluding&#13;
the contribution of households) for 2012-2014 in water&#13;
supply and sanitation are higher than recent investments&#13;
from 2009-2011. While this is a good sign, anticipated&#13;
investments still fall short of investment requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Current and future infrastructure would also need to&#13;
be supported by an estimated US$342 million/year in&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures (Table 2.2).&#13;
A large proportion (62%) of this amount is for water supply.&#13;
The critical issue here is whether tariffs of the utilities are&#13;
sufficiently high to cover operation and maintenance&#13;
requirements to support the water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities they need to maintain (and on top of that allow for&#13;
depreciation to replace investments and support expansion).&#13;
For facilities that are maintained by households, e.g. toilets&#13;
and hand pumps, the issue is whether such O&amp;M services&#13;
are readily available and affordable for rural households, to&#13;
avoid breakdown and collapse.&#13;

&amp;#12;3.	 Reform Context&#13;
&#13;
Since the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; independence in 1946 until 1955 most                 In 1995, the legal basis for the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest water&#13;
water supply systems were operated by local authorities.                    privatisation was approved through the National Water&#13;
From 1955 to 1971, control of urban water supply was                        Crisis Act. Two years after, two joint venture companies&#13;
passed to the national government.15 In the early years of the              succeeded in each securing for themselves a 25-year&#13;
Marcos Administration, several Presidential Decrees were                    concession agreement under the MWSS. Halfway through&#13;
passed that were designed to organize urban water supply                    this agreement, both companies succeeded in negotiating&#13;
and sanitation service delivery through national agencies                   a 15-year extension to address their urban sanitation&#13;
such as the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System                     performance targets, extending their service provision&#13;
(MWSS), the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA)                     arrangements until 2037.&#13;
and the Rural Waterworks Development Corporation (which&#13;
was eventually absorbed by LWUA). MWSS was a service                        In 2009-2010, the Philippine Water Supply Sector Roadmap&#13;
provider while LWUA and the RWDC were specialized                           and the Philippine Sustainable Sanitation Roadmap was&#13;
lending agencies that also provided organisational and                      prepared using multi-stakeholder dialogues. In 2011, the&#13;
technical assistance. LWUA organized Water Districts                        National Sewerage and Septage Management Program&#13;
in urban areas and the RWDC organized the Rural Water                       were approved for implementation.&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Associations in rural areas. The&#13;
RWDC was eventually absorbed by LWUA after seven years.                     Since 2011, government has introduced a number of&#13;
                                                                            measures designed to resolve the longstanding problems&#13;
With the devolution of responsibilities on basic service                    of fragmented and overlapping institutional mandates and&#13;
provision to the local government units (LGUs) under the                    a lack of direction in the sector. They include the following:&#13;
Local Government Code in 1991, barangays, municipalities,&#13;
cities and provinces were allowed to finance, operate and                   1.	 In 2011, the Department of Public Works and&#13;
maintain their own water supply systems. Since then a                           Highways (DPWH) was charged to act as lead agency&#13;
number of management and private sector partnership                             for the water supply and sanitation sector with the&#13;
models have emerged. The scope for private sector                               aim of improving sector performance. A team was&#13;
participation increased further following a Supreme Court                       subsequently established with World Bank support to&#13;
ruling that Water Districts do not have the exclusive right                     identify an appropriate structure for a lead water and&#13;
to operate public water supplies in cases where they fail to                    sanitation unit, develop an operational plan for water&#13;
provide an acceptable service to the entire population in the                   supply and sanitation and identify targets, investment&#13;
service area. This has opened the door for private sector                       plans and programs for the sector. The report and&#13;
operators (as well as not-for-profit associations) to deliver                   recommendations of the team were published in&#13;
services in areas with high demand.                                             May 2013. Among others, proposals included the&#13;

     Sanitation Unit (proposed within DPWH). As a follow-                     improved sector performance by articulating institutional&#13;
     up action, the government is currently in the process                    responsibilities for service provision, consolidating regulation&#13;
     of an institutional review to identify which department                  functions, and assigning responsibility for the overall&#13;
     and/or agency would be the most suitable for hosting                     planning and management of water supply and sanitation&#13;
     the dedicated â&#128;&#156;lead water and sanitation unitâ&#128;&#157;.                          services unambiguously to a single lead agency. Having&#13;
                                                                              said this, sanitation and hygiene promotion would remain&#13;

The Philippine water and sanitation sector has for years                          small private service providers, while LWUA regulates&#13;
been constrained by institutional fragmentation that                              some Water Districts, but only those in which they have&#13;
impedes progress in service delivery and the protection                           a financial interest. There is no agency regulating service&#13;
of water resources. Until recently there has been no single                       provision by LGUs. The lack of a strong, independent&#13;
agency to oversee the sector, but significant efforts are now                     regulator has impeded the achievement of universal access&#13;
underway to address this as outlined in Section 2.                                to adequate, reliable services and in some cases allowed&#13;
                                                                                  poor performance to continue unchecked.&#13;
Table 4.1 illustrates the complexity of current institutional&#13;
arrangements. Urban water supply services are provided                            While there is no formal clear-cut distinction between&#13;
by a host of agencies including the Metropolitan Water and                        the rural and urban subsectors, most rural piped water&#13;
Sewerage System (MWSS) in Manila and its two private                              schemes are operated by local government units with&#13;
concessionaires,17 the Local Water Utilities Administration                       the support of the Department of Interior and Local&#13;
(LWUA), that provides finance and technical assistance to                         Government (DILG) through the SALINTUBIG Program&#13;
around 600 water districts.18 Moreover, there are numerous                        for so-called â&#128;&#152;waterlessâ&#128;&#153; municipalities.20 The Department&#13;
small private service providers including housing developers                      of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) through the&#13;
and water cooperatives. For a number of large service                             KALAHI CIDDS program21 is a major supporter of rural&#13;
providers, regulation is done by contract.19 At present the                       water supplies usually for point source or communal water&#13;
National Water Resources Board (NWRB) regulates only                              systems. The Department of Agrarian Reform also funds&#13;

   Water Districts are quasi private water service providers, officially categorized as Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCC). Under Philippine&#13;
Laws, waterless municipalities are those where less than 50% of their population have access to potable water. GOCCs are stock or non-stock corporations&#13;
established by a special charter or law for the interest of everyone and subject to the test of economic viability. It is owned or controlled by the government&#13;
directly, or indirectly through a parent corporation or a subsidiary corporation.&#13;
19&#13;
   This means that the contractual agreements of the private provider and government agency provide for a regulator specific for their area of operation. Such&#13;
regulation by contract exists in Metro Manila, Subic, and other LGU-based service contracts.&#13;

water supply and sanitation projects. The recent MDGF Study on Investment Requirements report that DSWD plans to invest up to PhP 1.9 Billion a year from&#13;
2013 to 2019 for rural water supply projects alone.&#13;

 100% of the population in all cities/municipalities with sanitary toilets.&#13;

&amp;#12;The mandates for rural sanitation are not clearly defined, with                            which is a major sector concern given that they serve a very&#13;
two agencies having an operational role. The Department                                    large number of users.&#13;
of Health (DOH) holds lead responsibility and has adopted&#13;
a policy objective22 to achieve open defecation free status                                Following the designation of DPWH as lead agency for the&#13;
for all barangays, and universal access to sanitary toilets in                             sector, the team tasked with the development of a new&#13;
cities and municipalities. This policy has, however, received                              structure and mandate for the â&#128;&#156;lead water and sanitation&#13;
very little attention so far and little or no funding has been                             unitâ&#128;&#157;, and identification of investment plans and programs,&#13;
allocated for its implementation. At the same time, the Local                              proposed responsibilities for this lead sector agency in&#13;
Government Code assigns responsibility for rural sanitation                                its 2013 draft report, as listed in Table 4.2 below.23 It also&#13;
to LGUs, though there are no plans, targets or monitoring                                  proposed that the lead water and sanitation unit would&#13;
systems in place against which LGUs can be held                                            be hosted by DPWH. The report also recommended that&#13;
accountable. Local private sector providers of sanitation                                  a national capacity development program should be&#13;
goods and services are neither organized nor regulated.                                    developed for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
It is clear from the table that many roles and responsibilities                            With comprehensive proposals developed, the priority now&#13;
overlap. For instance, while resource regulation is by                                     is for government to adopt and implement the reforms,&#13;
the NWRB, economic regulation is done by a number of                                       complemented by a clear capacity development strategy&#13;
agencies: NWRB, LWUA, MWSS and a number of other                                           and plan. The government is in the process of an institutional&#13;
smaller regulatory offices created by contract to oversee                                  review to provide clarity as to which agency or department&#13;
special zones, for example Subic Bay. LGU water systems,                                   would be most suitable to host the proposed lead water&#13;
however, are outside the remit of any regulatory agency,                                   and sanitation unit.&#13;

 are difficult to track as there is no lead agency collating                       then develops proposals for the amount allocated. In&#13;
 this information. Some LGUs invest in water enterprises;                          other words, short-term plans are made to fit given annual&#13;
 legislators contribute to water supply projects from the                          budgets, rather than budgets being allocated to support&#13;
 Philippine Development Assistance Fund (more commonly                             phased plans to meet town- or district-wide targets. In fact&#13;
 known as pork barrel funds); and further investments are                          few, if any, cities outside the capital have a comprehensive&#13;

 water districts, some government-owned and controlled                             utilize the funds allocated is in any case compromized by&#13;
 corporations (GOCCs) and a number of NGOs. The                                    the limited capacity of LGUs to meet project requirements&#13;

 Appropriations Act (GAA). Since 2005, this has authorised                         supply sub-projects. This amount plus the SALINTUBIG&#13;
 an annual investment of PhP 1.5 billion (US$36 million) for                       Funds brings to PhP 3.4 billion (US$78 million) the total&#13;

    For 2012, the Salintubig Program was given a budget of PhP 800 million through the DILG and PhP 700 Million through LWUA. An additional PhP 500 million&#13;
 was also received by the DILG in 2012 to finance a number of water projects under the Transition Investment Support Plan (TISP) for ARMM. For 2013, a total&#13;
 of PhP 1.5 billion Salintubig Fund was allocated through the DILG. These budgets are mostly for water infrastructure with DILG allocating 4-5% of project costs&#13;
 for capacity development.&#13;

by LGUs, water districts and the private sector. These                              Private water service providers are generally more assiduous&#13;
remain under-utilized, however, as LGUs are reluctant to                            than their public counterparts in expanding services in urban&#13;
borrow, hoping instead that they can access grant funds                             areas, partly as a result of their contractual obligations. The&#13;

legislators. Moreover, LGUs do not generally prioritise                             in expansion and efficiency improvements for both water&#13;
water and sanitation in local investment plans as they lack                         supply and sewerage.29 Grants established under output-&#13;

supply grants to waterless municipalities were provided to                          National Economic Development Authority Infrastructure&#13;
LGUs and through the water districts either as grants or                            Committee (NEDA INFRACOM) authorized a 40% national&#13;

additional resources from LGUs, the private sector and                              National Sewerage and Septage Management Program&#13;
other actors. In addition, a Philippine Water Revolving Fund                        approved in 2011. To date, however, no projects have&#13;
(PWRF)28 operated from 2008-2013 to encourage private                               been established. Rural sanitation, meanwhile, receives&#13;
banks to lend to water projects. A total of PhP 4.3 billion                         very little funding from government and is generally&#13;

   Executive Order 279 of 2004 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations provided for reforms in the financing policies for the water supply and sewerage&#13;
sector and water service providers and for the rationalization of LWUAâ&#128;&#153;s organizational structure and operations. LWUA Employeeâ&#128;&#153;s Union filed a case in court&#13;
where they were granted a Temporary Restraining Order that prevented the implementation of this policy.&#13;
27&#13;
   LWUA provided soft loans to the water districts operating in waterless municipalities.&#13;
28&#13;
   The PWRF was set up by the Philippine government, American aid agency USAID and JICA to leverage concessional financing for water projects by bringing&#13;
in private financial institutions. USAID supported the capacity-building program, while JICA provided a 40-year soft loan to be lent on to individual projects. The&#13;
fund is administered by the Development Bank of the Philippines.&#13;

   In 2009, Manila Water managed to get Presidential Approval for contract extension until 2037. Maynilad Waterâ&#128;&#153;s contract extension was approved in 2010. The&#13;
longer concession period will allow the concessionaires to implement a higher investment plan while at the same time lowering the scheduled tariff adjustments&#13;
to ensure customer affordability.&#13;

   Manila Water is implementing a Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid funded project under the World Bank since 2007.&#13;

&amp;#12; 6.	 Sector Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
      Priority actions for monitoring and evaluation&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Harmonise data collection systems, standardise the definition of terms and develop a coherent sector monitoring&#13;
         framework&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Establish a collective platform for a multi-stakeholder review process to monitor subsector performance (for&#13;
         example Joint Annual Sector Reviews)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Subsector monitoring is a difficult task in the Philippines given                   Monitoring Programme. For example, government coverage&#13;
 the absence (until recently) of a lead agency to coordinate                         figures do not specify whether water supplies are safe to&#13;
 this important function. Currently, each agency monitors                            drink, pressure in the pipes is adequate or 24-hour supply&#13;
 its own concernsâ&#128;&#148;for instance, LWUA monitors only the                               is available.&#13;
 water districts that have outstanding loan obligations with&#13;
 them, while MWSS monitors exclusively the performance                               The harmonization of definitions and adoption of appropriate&#13;
 of their concessionaires. Furthermore, there is concern                             criteria for assessing the adequacy of hardware and services&#13;
 about the definition of terms, data collection strategies and                       is needed in order for reliable monitoring data that is useful&#13;
 approaches to monitoring and evaluation.                                            in planning and tracking progress in the sector to be&#13;

 There are several sources of population-based coverage                              performance benchmarking systems for LGUs and for a few&#13;
 data including the National Demographic and Health Survey                           water service providers; these need to be scaled up if they&#13;
 (NDHS) and the annual poverty indicators survey undertaken                          are be useful for broader sector monitoring.&#13;
 by the National Statistics Office. The Department of Health&#13;
 conducts its Field Health Services Information System                               The absence of a central regulatory agency contributes to&#13;
 (FHSIS) survey annually and NEDA regularly collects agency                          the lack of information on sector performance. There is no&#13;
 level information that it collates and integrates in national                       national asset registry system in place and while there is a&#13;
 plans and reports. An added complication in tracking                                water permit process under the National Water Resources&#13;
 progress in the sector is that these surveys do not apply                           Board, there is no obligation for those operators without a&#13;
 the same criteria for classifying facilities, and determining                       Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to register any new&#13;
 their adequacy as those used by the UNICEF-WHO Joint                                system that is being built.&#13;

    Compared to the JMP list, no distinction is made in the NSOâ&#128;&#153;s census on whether dug wells or springs are protected or not making them fall in the list of&#13;
 unimproved sources of water. Rain collection is also not in the NSO list. For sanitation, ventilated improved pit latrine and composting toilets are not in the NSO&#13;
 list considering that these types of toilets are not common in the Philippines. Water-sealed toilets with other depository in the NSO list would be similar to the&#13;
 flush or pour-flush to elsewhere category in the JMP list. However, the NDHS and APIS surveys also conducted by NSO use the JMP categories. The FHSIS&#13;
 reports do not have the different categories of sources of water and sanitary toilets in their reporting.&#13;
 32&#13;
    Licensed operators hold a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) and are registered service providers regulated by the National Water Resources Board.&#13;
 Water permits are only for resource extraction.&#13;

&amp;#12;Much of the available data on urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation relate to Metro Manila where the private sector&#13;
concessionaires submit regular reports to MWSS. Outside&#13;
of Metro Manila, water districts generally report to LWUA,&#13;
while for non-water districts, regulated CPC holders of the&#13;
NWRB are only required to report every five years.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibility for monitoring rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation coverage rests with provincial and municipal&#13;
LGUs. The DILG has started to collect this information,&#13;
but mostly for the waterless municipalities under their&#13;
SALINTUBIG Program.&#13;
&#13;
A proposal to set up an inter-agency, multi-stakeholder&#13;
platform for sector monitoring was strongly supported in&#13;
the SDA stakeholder consultation workshops. The approval&#13;
of the proposed National Water Resources Management&#13;
Office provides for the creation of one national, and several&#13;
local level, multi-stakeholder platforms for monitoring&#13;
progress and for knowledge, information sharing and&#13;
collaboration.&#13;

&amp;#12;Strategies are needed to improve the quality and&#13;
sustainability of service delivery and facilitate greater access&#13;
to piped schemes by the poor. One element in achieving&#13;
this would be to encourage water service providers to&#13;
develop operations large enough to achieve economies of&#13;
scale, though the consolidation of small providers and/or by&#13;
enabling access to finance for system expansion via tariffs,&#13;
borrowing or public grants.&#13;
&#13;
At national level, another important initiative would be to&#13;
formalize the management of smaller schemes such as&#13;
those under LGU control and bring them within the remit&#13;
of the sector regulator. It is encouraging that plans for&#13;
this are already underway, with regulatory requirements&#13;
differentiated according to the level of service offered.&#13;
Performance contracts could be a vehicle for regulation,&#13;
helping to drive service quality and reliability and&#13;
incentivising service provision to the poor.&#13;

 For the subsector as a whole, there are some important                                   There are various funding sources that can be tapped&#13;
 gaps in the current institutional framework, not the least                               for urban water supply development. However, there is&#13;
 of which is that there is no lead agency tasked with                                     general concern that while loan funds are available, the&#13;
 coordination, planning and policy development, nor any                                   average utilisation rate has been less than 50% over the&#13;
 platform for sector-wide, multi-stakeholder assessment of                                past three years. Many LGUs or service providers (such as&#13;

 The Philippine Water Supply Sector Roadmap was                                           public disbursement procedures. Similarly, many LGUs lack&#13;

   The Philippine Water Supply Roadmap (NEDA, 2010) provides definitions of Levels 1 to 3 water services that are based on NEDA Board Resoluiation No. 12.&#13;
 These are as follows. Level 1 (point sources) is â&#128;&#152;a protected well or a developed spring with an outlet but without a distribution system as it is generally adaptable&#13;
 for rural areas where the houses are thinly scattered serving average of 15 households with people having to fetch water from up to 250 meters distance.â&#128;&#153; Level&#13;
 2 (communal water faucet system or stand post) is â&#128;&#152;a piped system with communal or public faucets usually serving 4-6 households within 25 meters distance.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
 Level 3 is â&#128;&#152;a fully reticulated system with individual house connections based on a daily water demand of more than 100 liters per person.â&#128;&#153;&#13;

&amp;#12;A difficulty with the approach above is that Villaluna (2013)                        Lifespan represents the projected number of years&#13;
does not provide guidance for a rural-urban analysis. Hence                          before a facility is fully replaced. The values used in the&#13;
the strategy adopted in the analysis was to first apportion                          analysis represent averages of the information provided a&#13;
the shares across the technologies at the national level. This                       consultation workshop at Tagaytay City on March 2013.&#13;
was then allocated across regions by assuming that the ratio&#13;
of the urban to rural users for a particular technology in 2025                      Sector-Specific Technologies: Sanitation 	&#13;
is the same as in 2008. In other words, if there are five times&#13;
as many people in urban areas compared to rural areas had                            Table A2.4 presents information on the expected household&#13;
access to piped facilities in 2008, then there will still be five                    distribution, costs and lifespans of key sanitation&#13;
times as many people in urban regions compared to rural                              technologies. The options included were based on the&#13;
regions that will have access to piped facilities in 2025.                           technologies reported in the 2008 NDHS (NSO, 2009; JMP,&#13;
                                                                                     2012b).&#13;
Unit capital costs represent expenditures for materials and&#13;
labor employed in the construction of the different facilities.                      Similar to water supply technologies, the distribution&#13;
The values used in the analysis were calculated using the                            of sanitation options for 2008 was based on the shares&#13;
raw data on the costs of Levels 1 to 3 systems provided                              indicated in the 2008 NDHS (NSO, 2009; JMP, 2012b). The&#13;

(a) SALINTUBIG project of the DILG, (b) KALAHI-CIDDS                                 which provides the information. The approach used in&#13;

 of sewers for the rural population are half of the costs of                    management for those households that have access&#13;

 the assumption is that sewers in rural areas are likely to be                  incorporated in the plans under the NSSMP and the targets&#13;
 less sophisticated than in urban areas, perhaps consisting                     of the concessionaires in Metro Manila and should therefore&#13;

 Costs of flush toilets to septic tanks and composting toilets                  Investment requirements for septage treatment were&#13;
 were taken from the Water, Agroforestry, Nutrition and                         calculated separately and incorporated in urban CAPEX&#13;

 rural areas.51 In the case of composting toilets, the per capita               concessionaire plans in Metro Manila suggests that 70% of&#13;
 costs used in the analysis (US$ 21/person) are a sixth of the                  the urban population will have access to septage treatment&#13;

    The ESI study (Rodriguez et. al., 2010) reports a CAPEX cost of US$ 144 per person for the sewage treatment. The World Bank and AusAID (2012) indicates&#13;
 CAPEX costs for decentralized sewage treatment systems of US$ 100-300 per person. It also estimates costs of US$ 450-1,300 per person for centralized&#13;
 systems. All values are at 2012 prices.&#13;

 Comparative Explanation of&#13;
 SDA Costing&#13;
 This annex describes the key differences in the assumptions             for example, investment requirements reported for the SDA&#13;
 and estimates of the SDA costing tool used in the current               (US$ 838 million) were about four times higher than the&#13;
 analysis and the Study on Developing the Institutional                  estimates of the De Vera study. The divergence between&#13;
 Framework for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and                the two sets of results can be explained by differences&#13;
 Identifying Investment Plans and Programs (De Vera et al.,              in assumptions. The most obvious difference lies in the&#13;

 Annex Table A3.1 indicates that investment requirements                 target year, (b) the inclusion of Level 1 facilities for the water&#13;
 in the current analysis are substantially higher than those             supply estimates, and (c) the inclusion of the toilets and on-&#13;
 obtained in the De Vera study. In the case of water supply              site facilities for sanitation.&#13;

            the World Bank’s water and sanitation program and local
            partners. The SDA analysis has three main components: a
            review of past water and sanitation coverage, a costing
            model to assess the adequacy of future investments, and a
            scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The SDA analysis relies on an
            intensive, facilitated consultation process, with government
            ownership, and self-assessment at its core. The SDA builds
            other recent assessments, and reform initiatives, currently
            being considered by the Office of the President, such as the
            study on developing the institutional framework for the
            water supply and sanitation sector and identifying
            investment plans and programs.
