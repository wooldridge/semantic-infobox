1. RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   On the whole, rural Chinese live longer and suffer less illness than they did two&#13;
decades ago. Better nutrition and higher immunization rates have contributed to those&#13;
gains; so also have substantial improvements in rural water supply. Between 1985 and&#13;
1993, the number of rural residents with convenient access to safe water more than&#13;
doubled, to some 520 million, or 57 percent of China's 920 million rural people. Of&#13;
these, approximately 400 million people (43 percent) presently drink piped water; about&#13;
half of the 205 million relying on hand pumps can also be considered to have a safe&#13;
supply. The remainder use a variety of sources, including springs, rivers, ponds, and&#13;
rainwater collectors.&#13;
1.2   Despite recent progress, over 400 million rural Chinese continue to suffer from&#13;
unsafe or insufficient water supplies. Problems include water sources with high pathogen&#13;
loads due to fecal or other contamination; water with high levels of naturally occurring&#13;
fluoride, arsenic, or salts; growing industrial and agricultural chemical pollution; and&#13;
seasonal water shortages. In China, as in other countries, the lack of safe water correlates&#13;
highly with poverty. Also positively correlated with poverty are behaviors that worsen&#13;
water-related disease. Examples include failure to protect the wells from contamination,&#13;
boil water before drinking, or wash hands before preparing or eating food. As a result,&#13;
many poor rural people suffer from common diarrheal diseases and helminth infections&#13;
and, more rarely, dysentery, hepatitis, typhoid and cholera.&#13;
1.3   Water Supply. To maintain momentum gained during the United Nations&#13;
"International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade" (1981-90), in 1991 China&#13;
set 1995 rural water supply goals at 35 to 50 percent coverage of drinking water meeting&#13;
international quality standards, including 35 to 40 percent of rural residents receiving&#13;
piped water supplies. Both goals were met and even more ambitious goals established for&#13;
2000, with the government hoping to provide 65 percent safe water and 50 percent piped&#13;
water coverage in rural areas by the turn of the century. The earlier investments were&#13;
targeted at the most easily solved problems. Those now needing help include 50 million&#13;
suffering from long-term water scarcity, and 40 million drinking water with excessive&#13;
levels of fluoride; the remainder drink saline or alkaline water, or water with high&#13;
concentrations of industrial pollutants, bacteria, viruses, and parasites.&#13;
1.4   Of the total rural population that is adequately served, over 75 percent presently&#13;
get their water through piped systems. Although basically all of the piped water supplies&#13;
have been deemed safe, hand pumped and other sources do not always reach that goal.&#13;
Construction and maintenance costs per person for piped systems are often higher than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for hand pumps, rainwater collectors, or similarly simple systems, but they are usually&#13;
preferred when financing can be arranged because their convenience is matched by the&#13;
ease of monitoring water quality. These systems are built at an average cost of Y 150-&#13;
200 per person, excluding household connection costs. Government policy supports&#13;
supplying villages with piped water systems where economically feasible, to capture&#13;
quality benefits.&#13;
1.5   Sanitation. Poor sanitary conditions and unhygienic practices in rural China&#13;
exacerbate health problems created by a lack of clean water. By 1995, some 80 percent&#13;
of rural households had some sort of household latrine. However, most of these facilities&#13;
are rudimentary at best: they provide temporary storage of wastes and are unprotected&#13;
from flies and other insect vectors of disease transmission. A reported 16 percent of the&#13;
rural population use "sanitary" latrines, usually defined as latrines with full walls and&#13;
roof, odorless and insect-free. In practice, this category is loosely defined to include&#13;
everything from fully enclosed pits to well-protected and ventilated structures. An&#13;
additional 18 percent have access to composting latrines that, when properly operated,&#13;
achieve high rates of pathogen destruction.  These composting latrines are quite&#13;
expensive compared with the average income in the poorer rural areas, and their spread&#13;
has been slow. The availability of public and school latrines is low. They rarely meet the&#13;
"sanitary" standard and most have no water available for hand-washing after use. Wastes&#13;
are collected and transported to the fields for use in agriculture, often without further&#13;
treatment. The use of human waste for fertilizer is a traditional practice, and will&#13;
undoubtedly continue. The main objectives of sanitation improvements are therefore to&#13;
improve the standard of latrines and to make reuse practices more hygienic.&#13;
1.6    Health Education. In most rural areas, a network of National Patriotic Health&#13;
Campaign Committee (NPHCC) workers, Women's Federation representatives, local&#13;
epidemic prevention stations (EPSs), and schools have led health education campaigns&#13;
encouraging a wide array of hygienic behaviors. That work, combined with a high&#13;
literacy rate (even in poor areas), has led to widespread knowledge of many basic health&#13;
behaviors, such as the importance of drinking boiled water. However, actual behavioral&#13;
change has been slow to follow, especially in poor areas where fuel may be scarce and&#13;
understanding of the link between raw water or unwashed hands and diarrhea is tenuous.&#13;
Realizing change demands a more effective delivery and content of health messages,&#13;
rather than a greater number of people receiving them.&#13;
1.7   Though widespread, health education in most rural areas provides little concrete&#13;
information to link hygienic behavior to improved health. Programs usually consist only&#13;
of the provision of textbooks to primary school students and some distribution of hygiene&#13;
information through mass media, such as radio programs and health bulletins. Teachers&#13;
receive little training in the delivery of classroom materials. Activities in the provincial&#13;
and recently established district health education institutions are often carried out on an&#13;
ad hoc basis by personnel who are in the majority doctors, not health education&#13;
specialists. To overcome this problem, some provinces have initiated specific programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
for health educators at medical universities, but most provinces still lack such specialized&#13;
training.&#13;
B. SECTOR ORGANIZATION&#13;
1.8   The Chinese government separates the administration of the urban and rural water&#13;
supply sectors. The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), together with the Ministry of&#13;
Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR), take charge of the research and technological&#13;
aspects of water conservancy, including irrigation and flood control, as well as allocating&#13;
surface water (MWR) and groundwater (MGMR) for various uses. MWR also oversees&#13;
the development of larger rural water systems, while the Ministry of Construction&#13;
regulates development of urban systems.&#13;
1.9   The national coordination responsibility for improving rural water supply,&#13;
sanitation and health education lies with the NPHCC under the Ministry of Public Health&#13;
(MOPH). The Committee was established in the 1950s with the objectives of health&#13;
promotion and disease prevention through organized mass participation. Early successes&#13;
included reduction of schistosomiasis and insect-borne diseases.  The NPHCC is&#13;
composed of senior officials from over 40 ministries and central agencies active in&#13;
planning, finance, health, water resources, environment, construction and material&#13;
allocation matters. Day-to-day work of the Committee is delegated to the Executive&#13;
Office of the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (NPHCCO).&#13;
Corresponding committees and offices exist at the provincial, prefectural and county&#13;
levels. Local epidemic prevention stations (EPSs), also under MOPH, monitor drinking&#13;
water quality and provide other health services to rural communities.&#13;
1.10 The China Rural Water Supply Technical Center (CRWSTC), under NPHCC, is&#13;
responsible for designing technical implementation strategies for rural water supply,&#13;
sanitation, and health education, and for coordinating technical personnel training. The&#13;
National Health Education Institute, another arm of NPHCC, designs health education&#13;
materials and trains health education personnel. NPHCC has also identified the All-&#13;
China Women's Federation, local hospitals and EPSs, and primary and secondary schools&#13;
as important sources of information propagation.&#13;
1.11  Planning, development and operation of the sector are generally carried out by&#13;
local offices of NPHCC, under the local health bureaus of MOPH. Expertise and&#13;
resources at the county level and below are both limited. Physical construction is mostly&#13;
carried out by local construction units and communities.&#13;
C. SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.12  Rural Water Supply. Over the past 15 years, rural water supply has become an&#13;
increasingly prominent rural development priority in China. China's total investment in&#13;
the sector during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90) was Y 9.4 billion, rising to&#13;
Y 15.2 billion during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95). Beneficiaries pay&#13;
most of the cost of improvements: while 24 percent of the financing for rural water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
supply has been provided by national and local governments, 26 percent comes from rural&#13;
collectives and 43 percent from individuals, with an additional 7 percent from other&#13;
sources.&#13;
1.13  China's past development efforts in the potable water sector have focused on&#13;
bringing water to urban centers and to the more easily served and wealthier rural areas.&#13;
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) shifts focus to the more remote regions, calling&#13;
for 65 percent access to safe water supply in China's poorest rural areas by 2000. To help&#13;
meet this goal of serving an additional 88 million people, MWR has targeted its&#13;
investments on the most water-scarce areas. In addition, sector planners are aiming for&#13;
50 percent coverage of piped water systems by 2000. Piped water systems will be&#13;
especially emphasized in China's rural towns and townships, but are promoted in all rural&#13;
areas as the safest means of supplying water. These ambitious goals call for a significant&#13;
increase in sector investments for the 1996-2000 period, to over Y 4.7 billion annually, or&#13;
Y 23.5 billion total.&#13;
1.14  Sanitation. Since the 1950s, the NPHCC has worked to expand the use of&#13;
latrines in rural areas. The Committee has also launched a number of pilot sanitation&#13;
projects and surveys, in conjunction with the State Education Committee, to study&#13;
primary school sanitation education and the use and disposal of human waste in rural&#13;
areas.  Until recently, however, efforts in this sector have been scattered and&#13;
uncoordinated, with most improvements left up to individual provinces or townships. In&#13;
some counties and villages, farmers building new houses are required to install sanitary&#13;
latrines, while in Henan Province, initiatives by the provincial government expanded&#13;
rural composting latrine coverage from 1 percent to nearly 30 percent between 1989 and&#13;
1994. However, such rapid improvements are difficult without subsidies from local or&#13;
provincial governments, and affordability is a major barrier to the sustainable&#13;
development of the sector: the cost of a composting latrine can range from Y 300 to&#13;
Y 2,000, more than half of annual household income in poorer areas. The high cost,&#13;
combined with poor understanding of the link between improved sanitation and better&#13;
health, lessens incentive to install the improved models. Recognizing that willingness to&#13;
pay for improved latrines correlates strongly with rising income levels, NPHCC&#13;
sanitation goals for the year 2000 range from 35 percent sanitary latrine coverage in the&#13;
poorest areas to 80 percent in the wealthiest.&#13;
1.15  In December 1996, the central government indicated its desire for more&#13;
comprehensive planning in the sanitation sector by issuing a formal State Planning&#13;
Commission (SPC) "Resolution on sanitation reform and development." The resolution&#13;
does not set out numerical goals for the sector, but emphasizes: (a) having health and&#13;
sanitation expenditures keep pace with the overall growth of the economy;&#13;
(b) strengthening the management capabilities of the organizations responsible for the&#13;
sector, both at central and local levels; and (c) the necessity for cooperative funding and&#13;
management between beneficiaries, work units, and local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.5 -&#13;
1.16  Health Education. In an effort to expand basic health education to even the&#13;
poorest rural areas, the NPHCC has since 1996 cooperated with the Ministries of Public&#13;
Health, Agriculture, and Communication, and the National Health Education Institute to&#13;
promote a "national health education campaign for 900 million farmers." The campaign&#13;
emphasizes the healthful use of clean water and sanitation facilities, and calls for more in-&#13;
depth training of village-level health officials, the establishment of health education&#13;
institutes in 75-80 percent of counties, training of 50 health education workers per million&#13;
population, and hygiene education courses in 80 percent of rural schools. Ultimately, the&#13;
campaign aims at having 50 percent of the rural population practicing safe hygiene habits&#13;
by 2000.&#13;
1.17  International Assistance. In addition to the Bank Group work in the sector&#13;
(para. 1.23), several other multilateral and bilateral institutions have worked with China&#13;
in improving its rural water supply and sanitation sector. In 1994-95 UNICEF, in&#13;
cooperation with NPHCCO and MWR's Rural Water Conservancy Department,&#13;
contributed $1.5 million to expand water supply coverage for 140,000 people in six&#13;
counties. UNICEF's 1996-2000 Water and Environmental Sanitation program focuses on&#13;
improving national policies and on the "three-in-one" integration of supplying safe water,&#13;
sanitary latrines, and health education. This program will invest a total of $12.9 million&#13;
to install primarily deep-well hand pumps in the poorest areas. UNICEF has also worked&#13;
with the National Health Education Institute to develop health education materials (in the&#13;
booklet "Knowledge for Life") targeted at housewives and primary and middle school&#13;
students. All of these activities provide valuable lessons for Bank Group-supported&#13;
work.&#13;
1.18  Building on the UNDP and World Bank partnership in rural water supply, through&#13;
the UNDP/World Bank Rural Water and Sanitation Group (RWSG), several joint UNDP/&#13;
World Bank projects have focused on technology development and capacity building in&#13;
support of the two IDA credits in the sector. The 1988 "Low Cost Water and Sanitation&#13;
Project" (CPR/88/01 1) provided technical assistance for the implementation and&#13;
maintenance of community water systems in two provinces; the 1991 "Capacity Building&#13;
and Investment Preparation for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in Poor and Remote&#13;
Areas" (CPR/91/141) invested $3.7 million in preparatory work for the Rural Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr. 2336-CHA).&#13;
1.19  Other regional and bilateral institutions have also helped finance water supply&#13;
improvements, rural water pollution control studies or health education initiatives&#13;
throughout the country. Most of these efforts have taken place at the village level,&#13;
typically in a single county.&#13;
1.20  Financing. The virtual absence of direct central government financing for the&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation sector distinguishes China from most other developing&#13;
countries. As the numbers make clear (para. 1.12), rural people rely mainly on their own&#13;
contributions to improve water supply. While capital costs for water supply are partially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
provided by local governments, water charges normally cover the cost of operations and&#13;
maintenance, and sometimes depreciation or debt service.&#13;
1.21  Demand for water supply services at the village level is extremely high, but that&#13;
for sanitation and health education is less so. Capital costs for public and communal&#13;
sanitation facilities are met by the local governments. Provincial or local governments&#13;
also occasionally subsidize the construction of household latrines in "model households"&#13;
or "model villages" for demonstration purposes; otherwise, household latrines are&#13;
privately built. Typically, only the wealthier rural households can afford to improve their&#13;
latrines. Expenditures on health and hygiene education are covered by provincial and&#13;
local budgets, but are well below targets recommended by the World Health&#13;
Organization. In many districts, only nominal amounts are made available in their&#13;
budgets and funds are often provided only for personnel expenditures, leaving staff&#13;
unable to conduct mandated training.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.22  The China Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on&#13;
March 18, 1997 highlighted human development as one of the five major themes in Bank&#13;
Group support for China's development. Within that theme, poverty reduction plays a&#13;
major program role. The poverty reduction program seeks to increase the resources&#13;
controlled by the poor, be these income generating (such as improved agricultural land),&#13;
contributing to future productivity (education), or protecting physical well being (health).&#13;
Improving rural water and sanitation meets several of those goals. It typically releases&#13;
labor for other purposes, can itself be a productive input, and, by lowering pollutant and&#13;
pathogen intake by the poor, helps protect their health.&#13;
1.23  The 15-year history of Bank Group involvement in the rural water and sanitation&#13;
sector in China, coupled with a much longer and very rich history elsewhere, provided&#13;
knowledge crucial to the design of the proposed new project. Two earlier IDA projects&#13;
[the 1985 Rural Water Supply Project (Cr. 1578-CHA, $80 million equivalent) and 1992&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr. 2336-CHA, $110 million equivalent)]&#13;
established that Chinese villagers, even in poor areas, would contribute capital and pay&#13;
tariffs sufficient to finance safe and convenient water supply.  Further, despite&#13;
abandoning collective farming, the village collective management structure remains&#13;
sufficiently robust to manage water systems. OED evaluation of the first IDA project&#13;
confirmed that finding, as well as financial and health benefits from water supply&#13;
investments.  The second project will be completed in 1998, and water supply&#13;
investments continue to perform well. Identified weaknesses in both projects include&#13;
occasional excess optimism, hence system overdesign, and the need to improve quality&#13;
through increased project office supervision of design and construction. Despite some&#13;
weaknesses, by international standards the water supply projects are extraordinary in their&#13;
cost recovery and sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.24  Sanitation and health education efforts have fared less well than water supply.&#13;
The first project supported only water supply. The Implementation Completion Report&#13;
from the first project noted that integration of water supply with health education and&#13;
sanitation would substantially increase health impacts. The second therefore added such&#13;
components. The sanitation work sought to replace existing latrines with composting&#13;
latrine models having high pathogen kill rates. Unfortunately, the cost of meeting&#13;
mandated material and construction quality requirements of the approved latrine designs&#13;
placed them out of reach for most of the poor villages targeted by the project. The issue&#13;
of affordability was remedied in part through subsidies; however, these fail to provide&#13;
even a short-run solution for individual poor households.  The proposed project&#13;
recognizes from Chinese and international experience that willingness-to-pay (WTP) for&#13;
improved latrines correlates highly with income. In the poor areas served by this project,&#13;
if individual households with a high WTP can be identified, they will be aided with&#13;
designs and other technical assistance, but the emphasis under the project will be on&#13;
changing water and sanitation-related behavior.&#13;
1.25  As discussed above (para. 1.6), although basic health knowledge is fairly&#13;
widespread, behavior in rural areas often does not match that knowledge. Slow progress&#13;
in changing behavior does not invalidate health education efforts.  International&#13;
experience has demonstrated the importance of careful targeting and very specific health&#13;
messages, rather than general injunctions to behave well. The project would support the&#13;
use of monitoring indicators and knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) studies to help refine&#13;
health messages and their delivery, thereby increasing the efficiency of these efforts.&#13;
1.26  In addition to its focus on poverty alleviation, the CAS stipulates a goal of&#13;
directing resources more generally to China's inland provinces. Those provinces have&#13;
captured a lower proportion of new investment flows than have coastal provinces,&#13;
exacerbating income disparities that threaten to impede long-run growth. The provinces&#13;
participating in the project are all inland, and thus their development helps to address this&#13;
problem.&#13;
1.27  The project thus responds to CAS objectives, while drawing on Bank Group and&#13;
other experience to enhance the efficiency of China's national program. The Bank&#13;
Group's strategy supports China's Ninth Five-Year Plan goals in the rural water and&#13;
sanitation sectors, providing a basis for joint action. The provincial and county focus&#13;
recognizes the effective decentralization of investment authority in China, and draws on&#13;
local political structures and commitment to induce wider use of the solutions&#13;
demonstrated under the project. Building on a tradition of local self-reliance, the project&#13;
identifies opportunities for and finances sustainable, safe water supplies for poor rural&#13;
residents.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
A. PROJECT AREA SELECTION&#13;
2.1   An estimated 4.6 million inhabitants of 40 project counties in Yunnan, Jiangxi,&#13;
Hubei and Hebei Provinces and Nei Mongol Autonomous Region would benefit from the&#13;
project. The proposed project provinces and autonomous region (hereafter referred to as&#13;
the provinces) all contain a large number of poor counties with substantial unmet safe&#13;
water needs. Participating counties were selected according to their: (a) rural poverty, in&#13;
which the poorest counties were given first rights of participation; (b) percentage of rural&#13;
people lacking access to improved water supplies; (c) number of people exposed to&#13;
unsafe water, as evidenced by fluoride or alkali content of drinking water, or by the&#13;
incidence of gastrointestinal illness; (d) existing provincial plans targeting priority areas&#13;
of rural water improvement; (e) demonstrated ability to provide the needed counterpart&#13;
funds; and (f) willingness to form and staff a county project office to agreed standards.&#13;
All participating counties are either among the nationally- or provincially-designated poor&#13;
counties, or have particularly severe health problems resulting from poor water quality.&#13;
2.2   The following paragraphs briefly describe the five project provinces. Further&#13;
details on project provinces and counties, and on their water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
goals, can be found in Annex 1. The map (IBRD 28662) bound into the back of this&#13;
volume shows county locations.&#13;
B. YUNNAN PROVINCE&#13;
2.3   Yunnan Province is located in southwest China and is bordered by the provinces&#13;
of Sichuan, Guizhou and Tibet Autonomous Region to the north, Guangxi Zhuang&#13;
Autonomous Region to the east, the countries of Vietnam and Lao PDR to the south, and&#13;
2&#13;
Myanmar to the west. It has a total land area of about 394,000 km . Mountains and hilly&#13;
land cover 94 percent of the province; six major rivers (5,000 km total) and more than 40&#13;
lakes dot the remainder of the surface. Rainfall is plentiful, averaging annually over&#13;
1,000 mm in most of Yunnan and ranging as high as 2,800 mm in the southwest. The&#13;
average temperature is 8 to 170C in January, 11 to 29°C in July.&#13;
2.4   The province has a population of some 40 million, of which 83 percent, or 33.4&#13;
million, live in rural areas. Yunnan has the largest percentage of minorities in China,&#13;
with Yi, Bai, Hani and 20 other minority nationalities accounting for nearly one-third of&#13;
the total population. It is among the poorest of China's provinces, with 1995 per capita&#13;
rural incomes averaging Y 1,011, and urban incomes Y 3,684. Incomes in the project&#13;
counties range from Y 395 to Y 978. Over 20 percent of the population is illiterate or&#13;
semi-illiterate and only 43 percent have received a full primary school education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
2.5   Fifty-nine percent of Yunnan's rural population, or 19.6 million people, now have&#13;
access to improved water. In the project counties, coverage is presently 31 percent, or&#13;
about half of the national average. Ten percent of the population use composting latrines,&#13;
with virtually zero coverage in the project counties, compared with 18 percent nationally.&#13;
Thirty-five percent of primary schools and 20 percent of middle schools have health&#13;
education classes.  Waterborne diseases and parasites remain common:  intestinal&#13;
infectious diseases affect 6 percent of the rural population; typhoid affects 20/100,000&#13;
people in the province and ranges as high as 125/100,000 in some project counties, as&#13;
compared with 8/100,000 nationally. The child (under age 5) mortality rate was 55/1,000&#13;
in 1995.&#13;
2.6   Yunnan has benefited from the ongoing World Bank Group Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Project (RWSS) and from recent UNICEF projects to increase rural water&#13;
supply coverage. RWSS, due for completion in 1998, will have invested Y 299 million&#13;
to provide clean drinking water to 1.3 million Yunnan rural residents in seven counties.&#13;
2.7   This project would invest a further Y 183 million in six counties to benefit&#13;
637,000 people in 324 villages, of whom an estimated 56 percent are ethnic minorities.&#13;
By the project's completion, 63 percent of the rural population in the project counties&#13;
would have access to improved water supplies.&#13;
C. HEBEI PROVINCE&#13;
2.8   Hebei Province is located in the North China Plain, surrounding the municipalities&#13;
of Beijing and Tianjin. It has an area of 187,000 km2 and is bordered by Liaoning&#13;
Province to the north, Shanxi to the west, Henan and Shandong to the south, and the&#13;
Bohai Sea to the east. The Hai River and its tributaries run through the southern half of&#13;
the province, and the Jingyunhe Canal system flows from north to south near the eastern&#13;
coast. Hebei supports 63.4 million people, or 5 percent of China's total. The average&#13;
temperature is 13.6°C.&#13;
2.9   Fifty-three million, or 84 percent, of Hebei's inhabitants live in rural areas. There&#13;
is a minority population of about 2 million, mainly Hui, Mongolians, and Manchurians,&#13;
concentrated in the northeastern part of the province. Rural incomes averaged Y 1,669&#13;
per capita in 1995, with an average annual income growth above 25 percent for the last&#13;
five years. Urban income for the same year was approximately Y 3,674. Average&#13;
income in the project counties ranges from Y 778 to Y 1,180.&#13;
2.10  Approximately 67 percent of the rural population, somewhat more than the&#13;
national average, have access to improved water supplies; in the project counties,&#13;
coverage is just 36 percent. Many of the remaining rural residents drink water that has&#13;
high concentrations of fluoride; the average incidence of fluorosis in the province is&#13;
167/100,000, affecting as many as 22 percent of the population in some project counties.&#13;
Dysentery affects between 9 and 1,100 per 100,000 people in the project counties, and&#13;
110/100,000 in the province as a whole; viral hepatitis is also prevalent. Fifteen percent&#13;
of household latrines in the province provide pathogen-free treatrnent, but that falls to just&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
5 percent in the project counties. In 1996, UNICEF provided a $1 million grant for three&#13;
counties in Hebei to further improve their water supply and sanitation facilities.&#13;
2.11  The project would invest Y 267 million to supply improved water to 963,000&#13;
people in nine counties and 533 villages, raising total coverage in the project counties to&#13;
66 percent. Two of the project counties are Manchu minority counties, and ethnic&#13;
minorities make up 25 percent of Hebei's project beneficiaries.&#13;
D. HUBEI PROVINCE&#13;
2.12  Hubei Province is located in east-central China, bordered by Jiangxi and Anhui&#13;
Provinces on the east, Henan and Shaanxi to the north, Sichuan to the west, and Hunan to&#13;
the south. The Yangtze River bisects eastern Hubei; most of Hubei's cities are&#13;
concentrated along the banks of the Yangtze and its main tributary, the Han River. The&#13;
eastern two-thirds of the province is a low-lying plain drained by those two rivers; the&#13;
western third is hilly. Hubei covers approximately 186,000 kmi2, and supports about 58&#13;
million people.&#13;
2.13  Seventy-eight percent of the population, or 45 million people, are rural&#13;
inhabitants. Two million (3.7 percent) are ethnic minorities, primarily Tujia, Miao, Hui&#13;
and Dong. Most ethnic minorities live in the Enshui Tujia and Miao Autonomous&#13;
Prefecture and in Yichang City. The average annual per capita rural income in the&#13;
province was Y 1,800 in 1995, compared with Y 4,435 in urban areas; rural income&#13;
growth has slowed in the past two years, but still averaged over 16 percent per year in the&#13;
five years to 1995. Per capita income in the project counties ranges from Y 1,016 to&#13;
Y 1,394.&#13;
2.14  By the end of 1995, 58 percent of the rural population, or 26 million people, were&#13;
served by improved water supply. In the project counties, coverage is just 34 percent, a&#13;
little over half the national average. Fourteen percent of the provincial rural population,&#13;
and 5 percent in the project counties (one-third the national average), use composting&#13;
latrines. Waterborne disease rates remain high, exacerbated by frequent flooding in the&#13;
plains: the average number of rural people contracting dysentery in 1995 was&#13;
105/100,000, typhoid 9.5/100,000, and viral hepatitis 88/100,000; 5.4 percent of the&#13;
population suffers from schistosomiasis, and 0.2 percent from fluorosis. Some 19.1&#13;
million people in Hubei drink unimproved water.&#13;
2.15  The project would provide clean water for 1.2 million rural inhabitants in 10&#13;
counties. Total investment would be Y 284 million to construct piped systems and&#13;
rainwater collectors supplying 721 villages, raising total coverage in the project counties&#13;
from 34 to 47 percent.&#13;
E. NEI MONGOL AUTONOMOUS REGION&#13;
2.16  The Nei Mongol Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) stretches across China's&#13;
northeastern plain, in the southeastern part of the Mongolia Plateau.  It borders&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces to the east, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi to the&#13;
south, Gansu and Ningxia to the west, and Russia and Outer Mongolia to the north. Total&#13;
2&#13;
land area is 1.2 million km  (12.3 percent of China's total), including 86.7 million&#13;
hectares of grassland, the most in the country. The land is extremely dry, with annual&#13;
precipitation ranging from 50-500 mm, and evaporation between 1,000 and 3,000 mm.&#13;
Droughts are common. Winters are very long and harsh; summers are often short and&#13;
mild, with high concentration of rainfall.&#13;
2.17  Of 22.8 million people in Nei Mongol, 14 million, or 62 percent, are rural&#13;
residents. About 20 percent are ethnic minorities, including 3.7 million Mongolians. The&#13;
minority population is concentrated in four counties, and makes up less than 3 percent of&#13;
the population outside of those counties. Average per capita income in rural areas was&#13;
Y 1,208 in 1995, and in urban areas Y 2,863; in the project counties, average rural per&#13;
capita income ranges from Y 720 to Y 960.&#13;
2.18  Sixty-two percent (8.8 million) of Nei Mongol's rural population have access to&#13;
improved water supplies, about equal to the national average. However, coverage is very&#13;
uneven, with only 14 percent of the rural population in the project counties having access.&#13;
Due to the arid climate, waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid are not as&#13;
prevalent as in the south; however, hepatitis is common, affecting between 130 and&#13;
430/100,000 in the project counties, and dysentery between 450 and 580/100,000, as&#13;
compared with 71/100,000 and 35/100,000 in the region as a whole. Fluorosis affects&#13;
between 6 and 17 percent of the population in the project counties, and 9 percent in the&#13;
entire region. Some 300,000 people in the central part of the region suffer from skin and&#13;
dental disease caused by arsenic poisoning. Coverage of composting latrines in the&#13;
region is the lowest of the five project provinces, at 7.5 percent in the region and less than&#13;
0.5 percent in the project counties, compared with 18 percent nationally. Some of the&#13;
project counties participated in the UNICEF "Knowledge for Life" program in 1994-95,&#13;
but unhygienic practice remains common.&#13;
2.19 The region was included in the World Bank Group's RWSS project in 1992,&#13;
which by its completion will have invested Y 211 million to supply safe drinking water to&#13;
1.3 million rural residents in nine counties.&#13;
2.20  The proposed project carries a total investment of Y 167 million, which would&#13;
provide safe piped and hand-pumped drinking water to an additional 640,000 rural&#13;
residents, 20 percent of whom are ethnic minorities. The investment will raise safe water&#13;
coverage in the six project counties and 1,034 villages from 14 to 66 percent&#13;
F. JIANGXI PROVINCE&#13;
2.21  Jiangxi Province is located in southeastern China, with a total land area of&#13;
2&#13;
166,900 km . Bordering it are Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces to the east, Guangdong to&#13;
the south, Hunan to the west, and Hubei and Anhui to the north. Four-fifths of the&#13;
province's area is mountainous or hilly, with plains in the north. Jiangxi is rich in water&#13;
resources, with more than 160 rivers and China's largest freshwater lake, the Poyang.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
2.22  The province has a total population of 41 million, with 32 million living in rural&#13;
areas. Just 0.1 percent of Jiangxi's population are non-Han; of these, the She are the&#13;
largest nationality, concentrated in three minority autonomous townships. Average rural&#13;
per capita income in 1995 was Y 1,537, compared with Y 3,046 in urban areas; over the&#13;
five years to 1995, rural per capita incomes have grown at an average of 25 percent per&#13;
year. Rural per capita income in the project counties ranges from Y 620 to Y 1,320.&#13;
2.23  Fifty-six percent (18 million) of the rural population have access to improved&#13;
water supplies, slightly less than the national average; however, in the project counties&#13;
coverage is just 30 percent. Only 8 percent of the rural population use composting&#13;
latrines, less than half the national average; in the project counties, coverage is below 7&#13;
percent. Waterborne diseases and fluorosis are especially prevalent in Jiangxi, with&#13;
dysentery affecting 112/100,000 people; viral hepatitis and typhoid strike 55 and 10 of&#13;
100,000 respectively. In some project counties, hepatitis and dysentery occur up to twice&#13;
as frequently. Some 8 million people in the province, or 20 percent of the population,&#13;
suffer from fluorosis; in the project counties, incidence rates range as high as 35 percent.&#13;
2.24  The project would provide a total investment of Y 267 million for 161 piped&#13;
water systems in nine counties and 441 villages. It would supply clean drinking water to&#13;
1.1 million rural Jiangxi inhabitants, of which 0.5 percent are ethnic minorities. The&#13;
project would more than double improved water coverage in the project counties to 60&#13;
percent.&#13;
G. FORMULATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
2.25  Previous international experience in this sector suggests that a linked approach,&#13;
combining water supply, sanitation and health education, is needed to maximize the&#13;
health and productivity benefits gained from improved water supply. This project aims to&#13;
complement China's efforts in improving rural water supply and sanitation and build on&#13;
previous Bank Group sector experience, by providing financing to 40 counties in five&#13;
provinces for water supply, sanitation and health education, and project management. An&#13;
IDA credit of $70 million will make up 52 percent of the project's total investment of&#13;
$134 million; the other 48 percent will be provided by provincial and local governments,&#13;
and by the individuals benefiting from the project. Ultimately, the costs of the project&#13;
will be borne by the beneficiaries, in capital contributions and through water tariffs that&#13;
finance loan repayment. The project will contribute to government-led efforts to upgrade&#13;
rural people's water supply and health/hygiene awareness, and will improve standards of&#13;
living and health conditions for the 4.6 million beneficiaries.&#13;

3. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project supports government-led efforts to improve the well-being of rural&#13;
people through better drinking water and sanitation conditions in poor and remote&#13;
villages. The principal objective of the project is to provide access to safe, conveniently&#13;
located water to 4.6 million poor rural people in Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Yunnan&#13;
provinces and Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, and to improve related water and&#13;
sanitation practices. A supporting objective is to provide the water at the lowest possible&#13;
cost and to ensure its sustainability through good maintenance and accounting practices.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The project design links physical investment in safe water supply systems with&#13;
provision of related health and sanitation information and demonstration facilities, in&#13;
order to maximize health and productivity improvements within the beneficiary&#13;
population. A project management and training component supports those investments.&#13;
A detailed project description is given in Annex 2. A summary description of the core&#13;
project components is given below. The indicated costs include physical and price&#13;
contingencies.&#13;
*  Water Supply.  Provision of safe water, sustainably financed, to poor&#13;
communities currently lacking such supplies. Project design maximizes&#13;
community participation in the selection of service alternatives. Users would&#13;
be expected to pay the full cost of the water. Support for water system&#13;
operator and accountant training to ensure low-cost operation and project&#13;
sustainability.                                     $116.4 million&#13;
*  Sanitation and Health Education. Assistance to ongoing village sanitation&#13;
and health education efforts. This component would work with primary&#13;
school teachers, village doctors, Women's Federation representatives, and&#13;
public health systems in their efforts to improve water use and sanitation&#13;
practices in the villages. It would support demonstration programs to increase&#13;
use of composting latrines; the preparation of health education messages&#13;
aimed at expanding the adoption of improved sanitation and hygiene practices&#13;
among the target beneficiaries, primarily housewives, school-aged children&#13;
and decisionmakers in households; and training of health education specialists&#13;
in delivery of those messages.                       $11.5 million&#13;
* Project Management. Support to increase project office capacity to provide&#13;
services to beneficiary villages. This would include surveys and research on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
effective strategies to expand adoption of improved sanitation and convey&#13;
health messages. It would encompass training in project management skills&#13;
such as procurement, water supply technologies, water quality protection, and&#13;
health message delivery.                                  $6.1 million&#13;
TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COST                            $134.0 million&#13;
3.3   The financial, utility management, rural water system development, and health&#13;
and sanitation education policy initiatives would focus on: (a) achieving full recovery of&#13;
system costs through the water charges; (b) setting performance standards for rural water&#13;
utility operations and financial reporting; (c) bringing greater beneficiary participation in&#13;
the choice of village water system selected; and (d) using KAP and baseline surveys to&#13;
develop targeted health and sanitation messages for water supply recipient villages.&#13;
These initiatives, developed in consultation with project provinces, advance current&#13;
practice in the sector. If they demonstrate the expected efficiency increases, they will be&#13;
adopted more broadly through the NPHCC system.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
3.4   The following monitoring indicators will measure project effectiveness in&#13;
providing safe, sustainably financed water in sufficient quantity to people now lacking&#13;
such water and in helping villagers modify their individual health and sanitation&#13;
behaviors to increase health benefits from improved water supplies.&#13;
(a)   For water supply:&#13;
(i)   the number of villagers newly served by project-supplied water&#13;
meeting national rural water quality standards, with the goal of&#13;
serving 4.6 million over five years (annual targets in Annex 9); and&#13;
(ii)   the percentage of project water facilities achieving sufficient&#13;
revenues, not later than the second full fiscal year of operation, to&#13;
cover their operation and maintenance costs, administrative costs,&#13;
taxes, and the greater of (a) interest charges and depreciation or&#13;
(b) debt service payments, with a target of 95 percent success in all&#13;
years.&#13;
(b)   For sanitation and health education:&#13;
(i)   the number of sanitary latrines constructed in villages in the project&#13;
counties in addition to those constructed under the project; and&#13;
(ii)   an average five percentage point improvement compared to the&#13;
baseline period in the key water-related health behavior of washing&#13;
hands before food preparation or eating. A survey of monitoring&#13;
indicators, conducted under the PHRD grant facility prior to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
project effectiveness, will suggest province-specific indicators for&#13;
behavioral changes. Once established, these indicators will be&#13;
added to those listed above.&#13;
3.5   Each indicator will require a baseline against which to measure the effectiveness of&#13;
the project in achieving the design objectives. The baseline data will be obtained from&#13;
village surveys conducted before project investments commence. The terms of reference&#13;
for the baseline survey will be developed from the results of the PHRD-financed monitoring&#13;
indicators study. The baseline sample framework, survey methodologies, and data would&#13;
be reviewed at the Project Launch Workshop. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the provinces would complete the baseline surveys for villages receiving new&#13;
water supplies in 1998 and submit them to the NPO no later than December 1, 1997. The&#13;
NPO shall consolidate and analyze those surveys, submitting them to IDA no later than&#13;
January 1, 1998.&#13;
3.6   Resurveys for monitoring and evaluation would be conducted every two years&#13;
after the investment program begins. Provinces would analyze county information and&#13;
report it to the National Project Office (NPO), which in turn would share it with the&#13;
Association.&#13;
D. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.7   The estimated cost of the project, including contingencies and local duties and&#13;
taxes, is Y 1,191 million ($134 million equivalent). The foreign exchange component is&#13;
estimated at Y 312 million ($35.6 million equivalent), or about 27 percent of project&#13;
costs. Value-added tax (VAT) plus local customs duties and taxes are estimated at Y 184&#13;
million ($21 million). Land acquisition costs are estimated at Y 24 million ($2.7&#13;
million), or 2 percent of project costs. A summary of cost estimates is given in Table 3.1,&#13;
below. Interest during construction is estimated at Y 24 million ($2.7 million) and the&#13;
total financing required would be Y 1,215 million ($136.7 million equivalent). The rural&#13;
water supply component is expected to cost Y 1,037 million ($116.4 million), or 86&#13;
percent of project costs (including contingencies). Civil works, equipment and materials,&#13;
and consulting services and training each comprise 58, 33, and 5 percent of project costs,&#13;
respectively. Land acquisition and project management require the remaining 4 percent.&#13;
Additional cost estimate details are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
3.8   Base cost estimates reflect preliminary engineering designs and price levels&#13;
prevailing in June 1997. The unit prices were derived from the following sources:&#13;
(a) quotations obtained from manufacturers and suppliers; (b) prices of goods and works&#13;
from recent contracts; and (c) construction costs provided by the NPO, all adjusted for&#13;
inflation. Physical contingencies of 15 percent have been applied to base costs for most&#13;
components, except for first-year water supply investment costs, where 10 percent has&#13;
been adopted to reflect the higher confidence level of the final feasibility studies.&#13;

3.9      Price contingencies have been applied to expenditures at projected global foreign&#13;
and local inflation rates. In view of the variation between foreign and local price&#13;
contingency projections, the dollar/yuan exchange rate has been assumed to vary in order&#13;
to maintain purchasing power parity. The inflation rate projections used are as follows:&#13;

/b One half (July to December 1997) of the annual local inflation rate of 6.2 percent.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.10  The credit of $70 million equivalent at standard IDA terms would finance about&#13;
52 percent of total project costs. The remaining 48 percent would be financed by various&#13;
levels of government and the project beneficiaries, with the latter contributing no more&#13;
than 25 percent of initial capital costs. Interest during construction would be paid by the&#13;
county-level government. Financing plans of individual provinces vary in accordance&#13;
with their needs to borrow IDA funds and the local governments' and users' ability to&#13;
contribute. The summary financing plan for the project is shown in Table 3.2 and&#13;
financing plans by province and components are shown in Annex 4. The credit is&#13;
expected to cover 100 percent of foreign costs and 36 percent of local costs.&#13;

3.11  The IDA credit would be made to the People's Republic of China. The IDA&#13;
credit of SDR 51.4 million ($70 million equivalent) would carry a 35-year term,&#13;
including a 10-year grace period on standard Association terms. The proceeds of the&#13;
credit would be made available through MOF to the project provinces on the following&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association: the credit at a 3 percent service&#13;
charge, annually, for a 17-year period, including a 5-year grace period, and a commitment&#13;
charge of 0.50 percent per year on the undisbursed balance of the credit. During&#13;
negotiations, the mission confirmed that during the investment phase, each level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
government would bear any foreign exchange risk in proportion to its originally agreed&#13;
counterpart contribution. The foreign exchange risk with respect to credit repayment&#13;
would be borne solely by the provinces.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.12  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Association have&#13;
been agreed upon with the Government of China. The Association will finance the&#13;
project through the Interim Trust Fund, and hence the ITF rules will guide procurement&#13;
under the project. The borrower will consult the list of eligible source countries when&#13;
preparing and reviewing procurement actions to ensure compliance with eligibility rules.&#13;
All international competitive bidding (ICB) procurement will be organized through the&#13;
China National Chemical Construction Company International Tendering Company&#13;
(CNCCCITC), which has been contracted by the NPO to carry out that work.&#13;
CNCCCITC is an experienced and competent procurement agent with recent and relevant&#13;
experience in international competitive bidding on Bank/IDA-financed projects. All&#13;
other procurement will be conducted by the project offices. Intensive, continuous&#13;
procurement training financed under the project will help these offices maintain their&#13;
quality and expertise. The tender documents to be used in the project will be based on the&#13;
model bid documents prepared by MOF and approved by the World Bank Group. All&#13;
civil works are expected to have a value well below $10 million; therefore no ICB&#13;
procurement of civil works is anticipated. Contracts for equipment and materials shall be&#13;
grouped into packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more each, to&#13;
attract maximum international competition. Table 3.3 summarizes the procurement&#13;
categories and the expected procurement methods. The contract packages and method of&#13;
procurement have been agreed with the NPO.&#13;
3.13  Civil Works. The total value of civil works is estimated at $77.4 million. These&#13;
include water supply facilities (wells, pumphouses, treatment facilities, distribution&#13;
systems, offices, latrines, and storage areas), latrines under the sanitation component, and&#13;
some county warehouses (where suitable rental facilities are not available). Because even&#13;
the largest systems would have total investments below $1 million, with most systems&#13;
below $200,000, and because of their dispersed locations, all civil works would be&#13;
contracted by national competitive bidding (NCB), national shopping or force account.&#13;
Contracts with estimated values above $400,000 would be contracted by the provincial&#13;
project offices (PPOs) following the NCB procedures recently promulgated by the&#13;
government that have been reviewed and approved by the World Bank Group. Interested&#13;
foreign bidders would be allowed to bid for NCB contracts. For contracts with estimated&#13;
values below $400,000, project offices may use national shopping as an alternative to&#13;
NCB. In national shopping, the project office uses clear, uniform written specifications,&#13;
including delivery terms and conditions, to obtain bids from at least three qualified&#13;
contractors. For contracts with estimated values at or above $100,000, the PPO conducts&#13;
the shopping and qualified bidders must be from at least two different counties. For&#13;
contracts with estimated values below $100,000, the county project office (CPO) may&#13;
conduct the procurement. National shopping can be used for contracts up to an aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
value of $60 million. Included in this amount, force account may be used to procure civil&#13;
works valued at or below $20,000 in areas where there is no adequately qualified or&#13;
interested contractor. The aggregate value of force account procurement shall not exceed&#13;
$ 10 million.&#13;

3.14  Equipment and Materials. All project goods and works procurement would be&#13;
conducted in accordance with "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits," January 1995, revised January and August 1996. Procurement of major items of&#13;
equipment and materials-pipes, steel and pumps, along with audiovisual training&#13;
equipment and utility vehicles-amounting to about $44.0 million would be through ICB,&#13;
managed by the NPO on behalf of the project provinces. CNCCCITC would act as the&#13;
procurement agency. Qualified domestic suppliers will be eligible for a preference in bid&#13;
evaluation of 15 percent or the prevailing rate of customs duties and import taxes payable&#13;
by a nonexempt importer, whichever is less. That equipment and materials would be&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
procured through annual procurement actions. Additionally, the project would procure&#13;
printed and audiovisual sanitation and health education materials, with each package&#13;
valued under $100,000. These materials would be procured through national shopping,&#13;
up to a maximum of $500,000. No NCB equipment and materials procurement is&#13;
anticipated. Any needed equipment and materials not procured through ICB or national&#13;
shopping would be procured as part of the appropriate civil works contract.&#13;
3.15  Technical Assistance. An estimated $4.5 million will be devoted to technical&#13;
assistance, training, and the KAP survey. All consultants to be retained under the project&#13;
would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank Group's "Guidelines: Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," dated January 1997. A total&#13;
of about 9 person-months of foreign individual consultant assistance would be needed, as&#13;
well as up to five contracts for overseas training valued at less than $100,000 each.&#13;
3.16  The project requires a baseline survey and resurveys to establish project impacts.&#13;
These surveys have an estimated cost of $0.33 million. The project also relies on an&#13;
extensive training program to ensure efficient implementation, with an estimated cost of&#13;
$3.3 million. The Association has worked with the borrower to establish both total costs&#13;
and unit costs for the survey and training activities. Within the unit costs, the Association&#13;
has identified incremental costs of different types of surveys and training, defined as the&#13;
direct costs of the activity, net of government employee salaries and institutional&#13;
overheads. These incremental costs average 90 percent of total costs. The Association&#13;
would disburse against 100 percent of the eligible incremental costs. Eligibility would be&#13;
established through Association no-objection to the detailed survey and training plans, as&#13;
these are developed and reflected in the annual work program (para. 3.23).&#13;
3.17 Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. All equipment and materials ICB&#13;
packages (about five contracts, 100 percent of equipment and materials) would be subject&#13;
to the Association's prior review, including notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid&#13;
evaluation and contracts. Project civil works will include some 1,500 piped systems with&#13;
an average civil works contract value of about $50,000, 85 deep-well hand pumps with an&#13;
average value of under $1,000, and over 10,000 rainwater collectors, with an average&#13;
value below $100. For civil works contracts, the first piped system contract from each&#13;
project county (40 contracts), and thereafter approximately 10 randomly designated&#13;
contracts per year, would be subject to the Association's prior review. The high cost of&#13;
prior review relative to contract value necessitates the low prior review percentage.&#13;
Aggressive postreview, with all contracts in any given county postreviewed during&#13;
supervision mission visits to the county, will provide a strong incentive for good&#13;
performance. An estimated 20 percent of piped system contracts will be subject to&#13;
postreview.  The threshold for prior review of contracts for consultants would be&#13;
$100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 for individual contracts. For contracts below&#13;
the threshold, prior review will apply to terms of reference, single-source selection,&#13;
assignments of a critical nature, and any amendments that would raise contract value&#13;
above the prior review threshold. Other contracts would be subject to selective postaward&#13;
review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.18 The proposed IDA credit of SDR 51.4 million ($70 million equivalent) would be&#13;
disbursed over a period of about five and a half years, matching the original disbursement&#13;
period under the ongoing RWSS project. This disbursement period is considered&#13;
sufficient because implementation risks are mitigated by (a) 10 percent of the five-year&#13;
investment program being prepared to final design level prior to appraisal; (b) including&#13;
two of the provinces in the ongoing RWSS project in the new project; and (c) planning&#13;
annual ICB procurement, thereby avoiding the bunching problems found in the RWSS&#13;
project. Civil works disbursement rates vary across provinces to reflect the different level&#13;
of equipment and materials procured through ICB. Provinces with high civil works&#13;
disbursement rates have less complex systems and higher rates of contractor-supplied&#13;
materials.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.19  To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$5.0 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be&#13;
established. It would be replenished monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn&#13;
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs), confirmed by the NPO, for: (a) contracts&#13;
for (i) civil works valued at less than $2.5 million; and (ii) equipment and materials&#13;
costing less than $0.5 million equivalent; (b) contracts for consulting services costing less&#13;
than $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and&#13;
(c) training. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by MOF and made&#13;
available for inspection during the course of IDA supervision missions and by external&#13;
auditors. All other disbursements will be made against fully documented expenditures.&#13;
A Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex 5. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by December 31, 2002, and, therefore, the Credit Closing Date would be&#13;
June 30, 2003.&#13;
H. LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
3.20  All investment components-water supply, whether household, village system, or&#13;
larger, and latrines, be they household or school-will require land. Household-specific&#13;
investments, such as hand pumps or household latrines, require no special action for land&#13;
acquisition and are not covered by Chinese law or Bank Group policy. Nor are school&#13;
latrines, when the land used is on the school grounds. The only investments that may&#13;
invoke Chinese law or Bank Group policy are village-specific or multivillage water&#13;
supply schemes. Based on first-year designs, single-village schemes would comprise&#13;
about half of all water supply systems financed. In China, villagers collectively own the&#13;
land in their village. The villagers then assign themselves rights of varying duration for&#13;
the use of the land, with periodic reallocation of those rights. The State does not involve&#13;
itself in the rights allocation, except where concern about the conversion of cultivated&#13;
land to nonagricultural activities has led the State to require registration of such&#13;
conversion and, in some cases, payment of fees.&#13;
3.21  When water supply systems supply more than one village, the water plant requires&#13;
the collective land of one of the villages. In these cases, the land would be acquired by&#13;
the county or township authorities under eminent domain, and both Chinese law and&#13;
Bank Group policy would apply. The typical taking for each treatment plant would be no&#13;
larger than 4-8 mu (4/15 to 8/15 hectare). To ensure that planners minimize land&#13;
acquisition, the Resettlement Policy Framework (para. 3.22) stipulates that where planned&#13;
or actual land acquisition exceeds 3 mu (1/5 of a hectare) for any individual investment,&#13;
the county will be required to obtain PPO no-objection in addition to any local clearances&#13;
needed. Where planned or actual land acquisition exceeds 5 mu (1/3 of a hectare) for any&#13;
investment, or where residential buildings will be acquired, the county will be required to&#13;
obtain NPO no-objection in addition to any local clearances needed. Considerable&#13;
flexibility usually exists in water plant siting, so that housing or other buildings need&#13;
rarely, if ever, be acquired. On the other hand, acquisition of cultivated land may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
difficult to avoid. Where that happens, the current users will be compensated in a fashion&#13;
that maintains or increases their standard of living.&#13;
3.22  Information on land required for each water supply scheme would be known only&#13;
on a year-to-year basis, as feasibility studies for the upcoming years' investments are&#13;
completed. The land required for the first year is 11.7 ha in 131 separate schemes, with&#13;
an average acquisition of 0.09 ha. Most of this land was previously in field crops. The&#13;
total amount of land which would be acquired for all schemes over the five-year period is&#13;
estimated at less than 120 ha. This land would be acquired in approximately 1,500&#13;
different sites over the 40 counties, or an average of about 0.08 ha per scheme.&#13;
Reflecting the modest impact in any affected village (typically no more than two&#13;
households affected), and the expectation that actual impacts will be known only on a&#13;
year-to-year basis, the Bank Group did not seek an overall Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) for the project. Rather, a Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation of Project-Affected Persons (Annex 11) was agreed with the government&#13;
during negotiations.  The Framework requires each CPO  to prepare an annual&#13;
Resettlement Inventory if fewer than 150 people are affected and otherwise to prepare a&#13;
RAP. Each annual Inventory or RAP will be reviewed by the respective PPO and the&#13;
NPO for conformity with the Framework and included in the NPO's Annual Work Plan&#13;
(AWP). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that each province would carry&#13;
out or cause to be carried out the resettlement of persons affected by the project&#13;
according to the agreed Resettlement Policy Framework and in a manner satisfactory to&#13;
the Association.&#13;
I. PROJECT ANNUAL WORK PLAN&#13;
3.23  During every year of project implementation, each project province will prepare&#13;
an AWP, to encompass the work program for the following construction year. The plan&#13;
would include information on the construction of proposed water supply investments and&#13;
latrine facilities, detailed training programs for all project components, financing and&#13;
staffing plans for project office management, planned procurement actions, schedules for&#13;
the development and dissemination of health education materials, and resettlement&#13;
inventories and RAPs. The PPO AWPs will be submitted to the NPO for approval by&#13;
October 15 of each year. Based on these provincial plans, the NPO will prepare a&#13;
comprehensive AWP comprising the same areas, and will submit it to IDA for review and&#13;
prior approval by November 30 of each year. The format and content of the AWP were&#13;
confirmed at negotiations and recorded in the Minutes of Negotiation.&#13;
J. PROJECT REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.24  The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 8. Operational&#13;
and financial monitoring indicators were given in para. 3.4, and the assumptions to the&#13;
investment projections are provided in Annex 12. The format and content of project&#13;
progress reports and project impact monitoring indicators and methodology were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
discussed and confirmed during negotiations, and recorded in the Minutes of&#13;
Negotiation.&#13;
3.25  Supervision missions will consider a broader set of indicators than those for&#13;
project impact monitoring, including:&#13;
(a)   Project Management:&#13;
(i)   the quality of mandatory review by the PPOs and NPO&#13;
(ii)   PPO and NPO supervision intensity&#13;
(iii)   adequacy of project office financing&#13;
(b)   Training:&#13;
(i)   frequency and coverage of training courses&#13;
(ii)   follow-up to training activities&#13;
(c)   Environmental Protection:&#13;
(i)   protection of project water sources&#13;
(ii)   compliance with environmental protection  measures during&#13;
construction&#13;
(d)   Resettlement: compliance with the Resettlement Policy Framework.&#13;
3.26 During negotiations, assurances were obtained that each CPO and PPO would&#13;
prepare semiannual progress reports and submit them to the NPO not later than one&#13;
month following the end of the reporting period The NPO would prepare and submit a&#13;
consolidated semiannual progress report to the Association not later than two and one-&#13;
half months following the end of the reporting period The format and content of the&#13;
reports were agreed and recorded in the Minutes of Negotiation. The first report would&#13;
cover two reporting periods, from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998. An implementation&#13;
completion report, reviewing the planned objectives and the achievements of the project,&#13;
including costs and benefits derived, and performance and contribution of all parties&#13;
associated with project execution, would be prepared by the NPO and submitted to the&#13;
Association within six months of the Closing Date. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that the NPO would (a) prepare, not later than six months after the&#13;
Closing Date, or such later date to be agreed with the Association, a plan for the future&#13;
operation of the project; and (b) afford the Association a reasonable opportunity to&#13;
exchange views on said plan.&#13;
3.27 To facilitate implementation, a Project Launch Workshop would be held in late&#13;
1997. Project supervision would monitor impact with respect to the objectives and focus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
on key sector issues such as beneficiary participation in system design, and water plant&#13;
operator and accountant training. Bank Group experience with supervision of the&#13;
ongoing RWSS project, which like the current project covers a large number of counties,&#13;
suggests that IDA supervision would require about 85 staff-weeks over the life of the&#13;
project, of which about 25 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for the review of&#13;
progress and audit reports, procurement actions and correspondence, etc., and 60 staff-&#13;
weeks would be in the field. The Bank resident mission will provide initial review of&#13;
procurement actions. The resident staff of the UNDP/World Bank Group Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program would also join the supervision team. More intensive supervision&#13;
would be required during the first three years of the project, during which time project&#13;
counties would gain experience with new means of beneficiary participation and national&#13;
and international procurement. Supervision would be provided by financial analysts,&#13;
water systems engineers, health and sanitation education specialists, and other specialists&#13;
as needed. The project supervision plan is shown in Annex 10.&#13;
3.28  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a mid-term review, to be&#13;
undertaken no later than March 15, 2000, would review progress in meeting project&#13;
objectives, as reflected by the monitoring indicators.  The review will identify any&#13;
changes needed to meet those project objectives, including but not limited to allocation of&#13;
unallocated credit funds and commitment of additional counterpart funds. The mid-term&#13;
review would pay particular attention to financial sustainability of the systems,&#13;
appropriateness of system design, effectiveness of health education messages, the demand&#13;
for new latrines, and associated policy issues critical to project and sector success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   Leading Groups. The responsibility for project management and implementation&#13;
is divided among national, provincial and county levels. At each level, Leading Groups&#13;
have been established to provide policy guidance and advice of an intersectoral nature.&#13;
Their responsibilities include: (a) formation and staffing of project offices; (b) oversight&#13;
of project offices; (c) resolving policy issues that arise during project implementation;&#13;
and (d) coordinating project issues across project-related government bureaus.&#13;
4.2   The National Leading Group is headed by the deputy director of NPHCC and the&#13;
director of the NPHCCO. A deputy director of NPHCCO and a director from the Foreign&#13;
Credit Office of the Ministry of Public Health complete the group.&#13;
4.3   At the provincial level, the Leading Groups are headed by Vice-Governors&#13;
responsible for health matters, with at least two bureau directors as members. County-&#13;
level Leading Groups are headed by county magistrates and such bureau directors as the&#13;
magistrate deems important to project execution.&#13;
4.4   Project Offices. Project offices have been established at each level to carry out&#13;
day-to-day project implementation. The project offices will be supported by sector&#13;
institutions, design institutes and international and national consultants. Their general&#13;
responsibilities include: (a) project design, guidance, coordination, supervision and&#13;
evaluation at each administrative level; (b) management of water supply investments;&#13;
(c) designing training programs and conducting national-, provincial- and county-level&#13;
training in health education and project management; (d) organizing and delivering&#13;
procurement of goods and civil works; (e) conducting mandatory reviews of water system&#13;
designs; (f) preparing project progress and financial reports; (g) implementing project&#13;
agreements and regulations; and (h) coordinating IDA mission visits and interaction&#13;
between the Association and domestic agencies supporting the implementation of the&#13;
project. County project offices have the critical responsibility of soliciting village interest&#13;
in improved water supply, helping to design systems responsive to villager needs, and&#13;
facilitating operation and maintenance of completed systems.&#13;
4.5   Project Office Staffing. The National Project Office, which was established to&#13;
manage the ongoing Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, is attached to NPHCCO&#13;
and is part of the China Rural Water Supply Technical Center (CRWSTC). A deputy&#13;
director of NPHCCO is the director of the NPO and the director of the CRWSTC is the&#13;
standing director of the NPO. The NPO has a staff of 15, including one director and one&#13;
office manager, two water supply engineers, four health education and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
specialists, two accountants, two training coordinators, two procurement officers, and a&#13;
translator.&#13;
4.6   Provincial project office staff are drawn from such provincial departments as&#13;
planning, finance, water conservancy and power, agriculture, urban construction, tax, and&#13;
patriotic health campaign committee offices. A director and from 12 to 16 technical,&#13;
financial and operational staff constitute the PPOs. Two of the PPOs, in Yunnan and Nei&#13;
Mongol, were established in 1992 to manage the implementation of RWSS. The other&#13;
three project provinces had established PPOs by November 1996.&#13;
4.7   The county project offices work under the guidance of county-level Leading&#13;
Groups and have 12 to 15 staff drawn from the same range of technical backgrounds as&#13;
the provincial project offices. The CPOs will include qualified construction supervision&#13;
staff and have recourse to county-level quality assurance offices when additional&#13;
supervisors are needed.&#13;
4.8   The NPO and the PPOs were fully staffed by project preappraisal. The CPOs will&#13;
be fully staffed at implementation. Project offices will be financed by counterpart&#13;
funding in participating counties and provinces. As part of the AWP, each project office&#13;
(CPOs, PPOs, NPO) is required to submit a project office budget and financing plan, to&#13;
be reviewed by IDA prior to the commencement of the year's construction.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
4.9   National Project Office. The NPO is responsible for overall project design,&#13;
general project guidance to PPOs and CPOs, and monitoring of project progress and&#13;
quality. Specific responsibilities include:&#13;
(a)   Design Review: Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the NPO&#13;
would appraise, using agreed criteria, all water supply investments with&#13;
an estimated total investment above Y 3.0 million for the quality of their&#13;
engineering and financial preparation and their overall feasibility.&#13;
Procurement of project-related works would not commence prior to&#13;
successful NPO appraisal. In addition, the NPO will be expected to&#13;
conduct site reviews of not fewer than 12 of the largest provincial projects&#13;
in any given year.  NPO prior review of projects during appraisal&#13;
demonstrated their ability to undertake this work to a high standard.&#13;
(b)   Procurement:  The NPO will formulate, lead, and monitor all ICB&#13;
procurement of goods.&#13;
(c)   Agreements: The NPO will execute all agreements related to the project&#13;
and will ensure compliance with regulations applicable to the project.&#13;
(d)   Baseline Survey: The NPO will develop and oversee the carrying out of&#13;
the project baseline survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(e)   Training: The NPO will be responsible for organizing and implementing&#13;
training programs at the national level.&#13;
(f)   Sanitation and Health Education: The NPO will be responsible for&#13;
managing the KAP study (para. 1.25) and the subsequent development of&#13;
health education materials.&#13;
(g)   Project Reporting and AWP: The NPO is responsible for consolidation&#13;
of provincial project reports and for mandatory progress reporting to IDA&#13;
(para. 3.26).   Assurances were obtained at negotiations that a&#13;
comprehensive project A WPfor the following year would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than November 30 of&#13;
each year.&#13;
(h)   Accounts and Audits: The NPO will prepare a national consolidated&#13;
account of project expenditures, to be submitted to IDA no later than&#13;
6 months after the end of the fiscal year. Para. 5.14 details NPO audit&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
4.10  Provincial Project Offices. The PPOs are responsible for organization, direction&#13;
and supervision of the implementation of county-level projects, and for quality of project&#13;
design and management at the provincial level:&#13;
(a)   Design Review: Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the PPOs&#13;
would appraise, using agreed criteria, all investments with an estimated&#13;
total investment above Y 0.5 million and not exceeding Y 3.0 million for&#13;
the quality of their engineering andfinancial preparation and their overall&#13;
feasibility. Within the mandatory review limits, procurement of project-&#13;
related works would not commence prior to successful PPO appraisal. In&#13;
addition, PPOs will be expected to conduct site review of no fewer than 20&#13;
projects per year, including at least two projects below the mandatory&#13;
review limit size.&#13;
(b)   Procurement:  PPOs will arrange for the formulation of annual ICB&#13;
goods procurement lists, and subsequently, for the acceptance and&#13;
distribution of goods received under ICB procurement. They will manage&#13;
procurement of civil works contracts with an estimated value of more than&#13;
$100,000.&#13;
(c)   Training: PPOs will be responsible for planning and execution of the&#13;
provincial-level training program. They will lead the training for the&#13;
county health education programs, and will assist the NPO in the design of&#13;
health education materials.&#13;
(d)   Project Reporting and Annual Work Plans: PPOs will consolidate all&#13;
investment implementation information and prepare monitoring reports to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
be submitted to the NPO, for further consolidation and submission to IDA.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that provincial project annual&#13;
work plans for the following year would be prepared and submitted to the&#13;
NPO for review and approval no later than October 15 of each year.&#13;
(e)   Accounts: PPOs will prepare consolidated accounts of provincial project&#13;
expenditures, to be retained at the Provincial Finance Bureau for mission&#13;
review. They will carry out an annual review of all water system and&#13;
county-level audits (para. 5.14) ensuring that counties act on audit&#13;
findings.&#13;
4.11   County Project Offices. The CPOs are responsible for project planning at the&#13;
county level, including design, construction and supervision of water supply investments&#13;
at the township and village level:&#13;
(a)   Design Review and Supervision: The CPOs have responsibility for&#13;
approval of designs with investment cost less than Y 0.5 million. Designs&#13;
are completed only after feasibility studies in which villages participate.&#13;
The village committee must formally approve the concept to be developed.&#13;
Where CPOs lack sufficient supervisory expertise, they will contract local&#13;
construction quality assurance offices to augment that capacity.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that for all water systems with&#13;
total investment above Y 0.5 million, the county quality assurance office&#13;
would be retained to verify that construction practices and standards have&#13;
met design specifications.&#13;
(b)   Procurement: CPO procurement responsibilities include preparation of&#13;
procurement documents and all aspects of the civil works tendering, bid&#13;
evaluation and award process.&#13;
(c)   Sanitation  and  Health  Education  Program:   CPOs also have&#13;
responsibility for planning, design, construction and management of&#13;
sanitation facilities under the project, as well as for assisting the NPO in&#13;
carrying out the project baseline survey. They will work with the NPO&#13;
and PPOs in designing health education work and will execute the&#13;
resulting work program.&#13;
(d)   Project Evaluation and Reporting:  The CPOs are responsible for&#13;
preparation of quarterly implementation progress reports for submission to&#13;
PPOs, and for ensuring that audit requirements under the project are met.&#13;
(e)   Audit:  CPOs will prepare consolidated accounts of county project&#13;
expenditures, to be retained at the Provincial Finance Bureau for mission&#13;
review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. FINANCE&#13;
A. GOVERNMENT COUNTERPART FINANCING&#13;
5.1   National Finance. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), rural water&#13;
supply expenditures totaled more than Y 15.2 billion. Of this amount, 24 percent was&#13;
financed by national and local governments, 26 percent by collectives and town and&#13;
village enterprises, 43 percent by beneficiaries and 7 percent by other sources. In 1995&#13;
alone, governments (17 percent) and beneficiaries (83 percent) invested more than Y 3&#13;
billion in rural water supply and sanitation. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-&#13;
2000) planned expenditures in the rural water supply sector amount to approximately&#13;
Y 23.5 billion, a 26 percent increase in real terms. Central Government-to-province&#13;
transfers for rural water supply have mainly come from the Small-Scale Water&#13;
Conservancy Project Fund and Drinking Water for Humans and Animals Fund. The&#13;
national government does not directly finance the ongoing RWSS Project, nor is it&#13;
expected to finance the new project, although some of its transfers to regional&#13;
governments are treated as provincial or county government contributions when used for&#13;
this purpose.&#13;
5.2   Provincial Finance. Provincial counterpart funding is expected to average 4&#13;
percent, or $5.3 million, of the $136.7 million total project financing requirements.&#13;
Provincial revenues allocated to fund this project are from several sources: agriculture,&#13;
enterprise and commercial taxes, and special allocations from the Drinking Water for&#13;
Humans and Animals Fund and Small-Scale Water Conservancy Project Fund. Due to&#13;
project financing commitments, on average, rural water supply, health education and&#13;
sanitation expenditures of the participating provincial governments will double during the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project. However, the provincial counterpart funding&#13;
requirement remains less than 1 percent of projected provincial on-budget expenditures,&#13;
and in the event prefectures or counties are unable to meet their counterpart funding&#13;
obligations during implementation, provinces should be able to meet the shortfall.&#13;
5.3   A summary of the five provincial governments' expenditure history in the water&#13;
supply, health education and sanitation sectors is provided in Annex 12. That annex also&#13;
demonstrates provincial ability to provide counterpart financing and undertake debt&#13;
service related to the project. Provinces have provided formal counterpart funding&#13;
commitments by revenue source by year.&#13;
5.4   Prefecture, County and Township Finance.  Prefectures, counties and&#13;
townships contribute the largest share of proposed government financing-21 percent, or&#13;
$28.1 million, of total project financing. These governments, through their finance&#13;
bureaus, provide all funding not met by the IDA credit, beneficiaries and provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
government contributions. In addition to funding CPO costs, their budgets are expected&#13;
to bear a share of the provincial and national project office management fees, and finance&#13;
the non-IDA portion of local health and sanitation training. With the beneficiaries, they&#13;
will finance a portion of water supply and sanitary latrine construction, interest during&#13;
construction, and transport, taxes and duties on goods and equipment.&#13;
5.5   In the past, the project counties have varied in their rural water, health education&#13;
and sanitation spending as a proportion of budgetary expenditures, ranging from 0 to 4&#13;
percent. With the proposed project, annual county-level spending on these sectors will&#13;
range from 0.2 to 10 percent of budgetary expenditures. As a criterion for county&#13;
selection, county budgetary revenues plus transfers had to yield a large enough surplus to&#13;
service the debt on the IDA credit and contribute the agreed amount of county counterpart&#13;
financing. The respective provincial finance bureaus are responsible for independently&#13;
assessing the ability of the prefecture and county governments to provide the required&#13;
counterpart funds from assured sources and identifying to IDA the sources of those funds.&#13;
County counterpart funding commitments by revenue source by year have been obtained&#13;
and placed in the Project Files. During implementation, the pattern of county and&#13;
township financing will vary across years to meet the physical progress needs of&#13;
construction.&#13;
B. BENEFICIARY FINANCING OF INVESTMENT COSTS&#13;
5.6   Benefiting villagers are expected to pay between 75 and 100 percent of the water&#13;
supply capital costs: in-kind labor and materials contributions (typically 10 to 15 percent&#13;
of the water facility investment costs), together with upfront cash payments collected&#13;
prior to construction, make up 25 percent of capital costs.  Through tariffs, the&#13;
beneficiaries repay the county for the 50 percent of the capital costs covered by the IDA&#13;
credit. The local government contribution (25 percent of capital costs) may also be&#13;
recaptured through the water tariff, at the option of the local government.&#13;
5.7   Based on recent costs from the ongoing RWSS Project, beneficiaries will on&#13;
average face the following per capita investment costs: for piped water systems, Y 170;&#13;
for hand pump systems Y 85; and for rainwater collectors, Y 290. Project village&#13;
committees will collect the community and villager cash contributions about 3 to 6&#13;
months in advance of construction to ensure firm commitment from the beneficiaries and&#13;
to cover startup costs.&#13;
5.8   The project will seek to identify villagers willing to construct improved household&#13;
latrines at their own expense, and in such cases provide technical assistance. In villages&#13;
where no such households can be found, but some villagers are able to contribute at least&#13;
half the cost of an improved latrine in labor and materials, the project will make a limited&#13;
amount of funding available to assist in purchasing inputs, for no more than three&#13;
household latrines per village. The latter expenses will be covered either by IDA&#13;
financing or government grants. Health education will be wholly government-financed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
By county option, beneficiaries may bear project office management costs through the&#13;
water tariff.&#13;
C. RECOVERY OF WATER SUPPLY COSTS&#13;
5.9   Rural beneficiaries in China have a long history of paying water supply operation&#13;
and maintenance costs, as well as a large portion of the capital costs. This has been true&#13;
under the first two IDA-financed projects and the practice will be continued under this&#13;
project. In addition to the capital contributions mentioned above, the tariffs will be set&#13;
locally and reviewed annually by the CPOs to ensure that they cover the full costs of&#13;
water supply. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that, commencing not later than&#13;
the second full fiscal year of operations of such investment, water charges will be&#13;
established and collected annually at a level sufficient to cover operations and&#13;
maintenance costs, administrative costs, taxes, and the greater of (a) interest charges and&#13;
depreciation, or (b) debt service requirements (interest plus principle repayment). No&#13;
subsidies from government on water supply credit repayment are anticipated, so tariffs&#13;
will fully cover these expenses. Water charges are expected to total Y 10 to Y 30 per&#13;
person per year (no more than 4 percent of average per capita income) depending on&#13;
location, type of service, and water volume consumed.&#13;
5.10  In many smaller communities with piped water systems, water usage is billed&#13;
according to household size rather than metered usage.  Although this in theory&#13;
discourages conservation, such supplies are often intermittent, limited to morning and&#13;
evening peak demand periods, and the investment and administrative costs of metering&#13;
outweigh any efficiency gains. The few poor communities with strong collective&#13;
enterprises may use those revenues to partially cover the cost of water. Where water&#13;
plants offer 24-hour water supply, the NPO and Association encourage the installation of&#13;
household meters to manage demand.  Rainwater collectors that serve individual&#13;
households involve large upfront costs, but negligible operations and maintenance costs.&#13;
Since these are household systems, debt service costs and capital contribution costs&#13;
cannot be recouped through a tariff. Rather, government has the choice of capturing&#13;
those costs through general revenues or assessing lump-sum charges on beneficiaries.&#13;
Other nonpiped systems, such as public hand pumps, also involve large upfront costs by&#13;
the end-users. Here, debt service on the IDA credit and operations and maintenance costs&#13;
are generally recouped through monthly usage fees based on household size.&#13;
D. WATER SUPPLY FACILITY MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.11  The project is expected to build nearly 1,500 piped water supply systems, all of&#13;
which must be managed on a long-term basis. The facilities will employ more than 6,000&#13;
locally recruited operations, finance and management staff and, collectively, earn more&#13;
than Y 70 million in revenues annually and have assets of almost Y 1.0 billion. It is&#13;
expected that these water supply systems will be managed by the CPO until the fixed&#13;
assets are completed, at which time the ownership and management of the assets will be&#13;
transferred to the village, township or county government depending on the size and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
coverage of the water supply system. Each water supply system is required to maintain&#13;
an independent accounting system (para. 5.12). To ensure the sustainable operation of&#13;
project assets, this project will train water system financial staff in basic bookkeeping&#13;
procedures, preparation of financial statements, establishing and maintaining a reliable&#13;
billings and collections system, and setting appropriate tariff levels. During project&#13;
preparation, grant funds from the Japanese PHRD facility are financing preparation of a&#13;
training program in the financial management of small-scale water systems, designed&#13;
specifically to meet the training requirements of rural water plant staff.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS&#13;
5.12  Water Supply Investment Accounting. A system for recording water supply&#13;
investment accounts during construction and subsequently during system operation has&#13;
been devised and used under the past two rural water supply projects. This accounting&#13;
system will be followed under this project. The simplified system provides for: (a) the&#13;
accounting of local expenditures at the community level and consolidation at county,&#13;
provincial and national levels; (b) the flow of funds from IDA, provinces, prefectures&#13;
(where applicable) and communities; and (c) the allocation of goods and expenditures for&#13;
ICB and NCB items to the respective local level offices and communities. In addition, a&#13;
separate accounting system for the operational water facility has been devised. The&#13;
simplified accounting system will allow preparation of end-of-year financial statements&#13;
(income statement, funds flow statement and balance sheet) to monitor the financial&#13;
performance of water supply systems and their compliance with financial covenants. The&#13;
format and content of water plant end-of-year financial statements were agreed at&#13;
negotiations and recorded in the Minutes of Negotiation.&#13;
5.13  Project Accounts.  Basic project accounts showing expenditures by project&#13;
component during implementation will be maintained at the CPOs. A provincial project&#13;
account consolidating county accounts, provincial component expenditures and the&#13;
province's share of expenditures incurred or administered by the NPO will be maintained&#13;
at each of the five PPOs. A total project account aggregating all provincial accounts will&#13;
be maintained by the NPO. The NPO will also be required to keep records and maintain&#13;
an account for all project funds administered or used by the office. MOF will maintain&#13;
accounts showing amounts expended under SOEs for each year and will maintain the&#13;
Special Account.&#13;
F. AUDITS&#13;
5.14  As with other Bank/IDA-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investment Audit&#13;
Bureau of the China National Auditing Organization (CNAO), established in 1983, would&#13;
have overall responsibility for auditing the project accounts. The actual auditing work will&#13;
be conducted by the respective provincial and county audit departmnents under CNAO's&#13;
supervision. This arrangement is satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the following annual audits would be submitted to the Association no later&#13;
than six months after the end of the fiscal year: (a) the national consolidated account of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
project expenditures prepared by the NPO; and (b) SOEs and Special Account maintained&#13;
by MOF. Additionally, the following annual audits should be carried out and maintained at&#13;
the Provincial Finance Bureau for mission review: (i) provincial consolidated accounts&#13;
prepared by the PPO, and (ii) county accounts of project expenditures carried out by the&#13;
CPOs. To ensure better review of large-scale water supply systems, the Association also&#13;
requires that each water plant facility with total investment greater than Y 5 million be&#13;
audited at the end of its first full fiscal year of operation in accordance with auditing&#13;
principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, such&#13;
audit to be submitted to IDA for review no later than 6 months after the end of the audited&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.1   As described in Chapter 1, the project derives from the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy for China in its support of national efforts to improve the welfare of poor rural&#13;
people. The most recent CAS, presented to the Board on March 18, 1997, stresses the&#13;
centrality of poverty alleviation to the Bank Group lending program. A related goal is to&#13;
direct resources to the inland provinces. The proposed project responds directly to both&#13;
of those concerns by supporting national and local efforts to expand safe water, village&#13;
sanitation and health education in five inland provinces. The IDA credit provides&#13;
financing of sufficient size, matched to the longevity of the asset, to allow an additional&#13;
4.6 million poor villagers access to safe water.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.2  In 1993 a national survey showed that only 57 percent of rural Chinese had access&#13;
to safe water. Using the construction of piped water systems as a proxy for the spread of&#13;
safe water since that time, coverage by the end of 1995 would have been on the order of&#13;
60 percent. Although the national survey did not relate coverage to village income,&#13;
fieldwork shows that poor villages are notably less likely to enjoy safe water supply than&#13;
are wealthier villages. This result is unremarkable in itself, but given the abundant&#13;
evidence of sufficient WTP for improved water in many poor villages, it does reveal a&#13;
role for Association financing.&#13;
6.3   Earlier rural water projects in China demonstrate that many poor villagers will,&#13;
and do, pay water charges adequate to finance improved water supplies. Although WTP&#13;
is adequate to cover operating costs and service a loan supporting water plant&#13;
construction, poor villagers lack the capital needed to finance the construction investment&#13;
up front. Ideally, water plant financing would match the 15-year design life that&#13;
characterizes most village water supply systems. The Chinese financial system itself&#13;
offers no such financing. Existing commercial loans are of much shorter duration, and&#13;
with competing investments offering much higher rates of return, a water company&#13;
serving a poor village is simply not an attractive investment from a commercial bank's&#13;
point of view. Responding to the need, the government has made rural water supply&#13;
eligible for loans through its antipoverty program. Other government financing includes&#13;
special national grant programs, with the largest administered by MWR. However, the&#13;
sums are small compared to the need, leading to the request for continued Association&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
6.4   Para. 1.12 documents villager self-reliance in water supply finance. In recent&#13;
years, 69 percent of investment costs were directly provided by villagers, through&#13;
individual payments or use of their collective's assets. Government grants and loans&#13;
provided 24 percent and international and other grants and loans, 7 percent. While&#13;
maintaining the government share at 25 percent of capital costs, the credit would finance&#13;
an additional 50 percent, dropping initial villager contributions low enough to encourage&#13;
participation by poorer villages. An even higher share of IDA financing would have&#13;
allowed still poorer areas to join, but reduced the total number of beneficiaries. The&#13;
chosen balance allowed targeting on poor areas, while maximizing beneficiary numbers.&#13;
6.5   The project is limited to interventions that require significant external finance.&#13;
Activities to ensure safe water need not require substantial physical investments. For&#13;
example, wells can be provided with low walls, covers, and local drainage to minimize&#13;
contamination, and treated at regular intervals with bleach or other chemicals to reduce&#13;
bacteria. None of those activities require external financial assistance and all are part of&#13;
the ongoing health education activities of NPHCC. While the efficacy of that work can&#13;
doubtless be enhanced, the government saw the comparative advantage of an Association&#13;
contribution to be those areas that demand a combination of behavioral change and&#13;
physical investment.&#13;
6.6   Province, County, and Village Choices. Chapter 2 and Annex 1 describe the&#13;
provinces and counties chosen for project participation. Project provinces were identified&#13;
by NPHCC, SPC, and MOF, guided by the CAS goal of choosing inland provinces and the&#13;
need to choose provinces with relatively large unserved rural populations. Given that both&#13;
wealthy and poor counties can be found in all project provinces, the choice of county&#13;
outweighs that of province in targeting assistance on poor people. Para. 2.1 describes the&#13;
county selection mechanism. The mechanism represents a compromise between the goal of&#13;
serving the poorest and the necessity of investing in areas where beneficiaries can meet their&#13;
share of initial investment costs, as well as afford the financial costs of systems operation&#13;
and loan repayment. This compromise has the effect of selecting those poor counties and&#13;
villages with average incomes well below the Y 3,050 average annual income of the&#13;
international standard poverty line of $1 per capita per day but near the Chinese poverty line&#13;
of Y 530 per year. Chosen counties had 1995 average annual incomes ranging from Y 400&#13;
to Y 1,430.  Counties and villages in even deeper poverty, yet needing substantial&#13;
investments to assure safe water supplies, need to be aided by a mechanism more leavened&#13;
with grant aid.&#13;
6.7   Ideally, participating villages would have been chosen by evaluating net present&#13;
value (NPV) generated by water investments, including any public health and social&#13;
welfare externalities, and choosing the set of investments maximizing NPV across all&#13;
villages. However, generating such information for the nearly 1,500 piped water and&#13;
thousands of nonpiped systems proposed would be excessively costly, if even possible.&#13;
As an alternative, villages are required to pass a test of revealed demand-a willingness&#13;
to supply 25 percent of the capital and levy water tariffs that cover the full operating costs&#13;
of and loans incurred by the system. Participating villages thereafter face these financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
requirements as a credit covenant.  This establishes private demand for the water&#13;
investments sufficient to ensure system financial sustainability and a positive economic&#13;
rate of return (ERR). A very wide array of villages would meet such a test, including&#13;
those that are relatively well off, yet still unserved by safe water. In the project counties,&#13;
an average of 22 percent of the rural population is already served by piped water systems.&#13;
These are typically in the wealthiest villages. Credit funds will therefore be going to&#13;
villages ranged about the average income for the county.&#13;
6.8   Returns to Water Supply. Within the project counties, the actual NPV of&#13;
investments will vary from system to system, depending on actual villager WTP, the&#13;
public health and social welfare externalities, and system economic costs. In none of the&#13;
villages visited by the appraisal mission was water marketed by vendors, nor was such&#13;
marketing reported for other project villages. In the absence of such a market, the use of&#13;
a financial covenant to test WTP on water supply investments does set a lower-bound&#13;
economic rate of return. The covenant (para. 5.9) requires that tariffs cover all operations&#13;
and maintenance costs and the greater of depreciation or debt service.  Chinese&#13;
depreciation schedules lead to an average system depreciation rate of 3.5 percent. The&#13;
onlending rate, as noted in para. 3.11, is 3 percent, with a 17-year maturity and 5 years'&#13;
grace, so debt service will exceed depreciation once repayment begins. Given that the&#13;
standard conversion factor for China is 1.0, major equipment and materials inputs are&#13;
acquired through ICB, VAT is 17 percent, and no major domestic input has an economic&#13;
price above its financial price, a simple calculation shows that if the financial covenant is&#13;
met, it sets a lower bound to the ERR of 3 percent. The actual rate will be higher in all&#13;
cases, as the demand curve for water is well behaved and the lower bound to the ERR&#13;
does not incorporate consumer surplus.  The government choice to direct scarce&#13;
international resources to these villages gives evidence of significant positive public&#13;
health or social welfare externalities additional to the private value of increased water&#13;
supply.&#13;
6.9   The covenanted tariffs yield positive lower-bound ERRs, but do not match the&#13;
established discount rate of 12 percent for Bank Group projects in China. The relative&#13;
contribution of consumer surplus therefore becomes a key issue for economic evaluation.&#13;
The demand curve for the improved supply depends very much on the original supply,&#13;
which typically remains available. Substitution of improved supply for unimproved will&#13;
occur only when the improved supply is cheaper than unimproved. Cost differences arise&#13;
in the time and labor effort needed for each source. Improved supply almost always&#13;
requires less time and effort, with no need to lift or pump well water, or face the long&#13;
trips needed to carry most surface supply. In addition, improved supply is more reliable&#13;
and needs less treatment to make it potable and safe.&#13;
6.10  Despite the advantages to improved supply, when alternative sources are close at&#13;
hand, the relatively low economic value of time in the poorest project villages may induce&#13;
villagers to continue using their original source. Using widely accepted methodology for&#13;
valuing time, households with a per capita income of Y 600 and currently served by shallow&#13;
wells in or near the housing compound can self-supply water for about Y 0.36/m3, well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
below the lowest tariff for improved supply. Where slightly more distant well or surface&#13;
sources are used, requiring 7.5 minutes for each round trip carrying two 20-liter pails, even&#13;
poor households face a time cost of as much as Y 0.90/m3. These costs rise rapidly with&#13;
income so that households at the top end of the project income range, about Y 1,500 per&#13;
capita, face a time cost of Y 0.83/m3 for nearby supply and Y 2.07/m for the more distant.&#13;
In many communities these costs vary with the season. During the rainy season, acceptable&#13;
sources may be nearby, but during the dry season each round trip may lengthen to 20&#13;
minutes or, in the worst cases, an hour.&#13;
6.11   Taking the minimum tariff covenant as a base, and assuming no real income&#13;
increase over the life of the project (hence a stable demand curve), consumer surplus&#13;
would have to equal nearly 40 percent of the income from water sales to realize positive&#13;
private NPV. Income growth, and a consequent shifting of the demand curve, would&#13;
lower that substantially. For example, 3 percent annual real income growth (well within&#13;
the experience of recent years), coupled with an income elasticity of demand for safe&#13;
water of 0.4, would lead to a positive NPV if initial consumer surplus were only 25&#13;
percent of water sales income. Under conservative assumptions about the shape of the&#13;
demand curve, based on empirical evidence in the current project, these rates of consumer&#13;
surplus can be expected, supporting the contention of positive NPVs in the project. See&#13;
Annex 13 for details.&#13;
6.12  Sanitation and Health Education. The economic analysis of the sanitation and&#13;
health education subcomponent presents challenging analytical problems on the benefit&#13;
side. Analysis of health and sanitation education projects worldwide have shown that&#13;
improved health behavior can substantially increase the health impact of a water supply&#13;
project. The decision to devote resources to such work under the project was based on the&#13;
international experience, rather than quantitative analysis of Chinese experience, for which&#13;
data do not exist. The project will include baseline and monitoring survey work to allow&#13;
such analysis in this project. Details are discussed in Annex 13.&#13;
C. BENEFICIARY AFFORDABILITY&#13;
6.13  The beneficiaries under the project are located within some of China's poorest&#13;
communities. Accordingly, offering low-cost water supply options and a means of&#13;
financing the chosen option through the water tariffs are key to the affordability of these&#13;
systems.  Beyond this, communities selected for inclusion in the project must&#13;
demonstrate their ability to pay for improved water supplies by collecting beneficiary&#13;
investment contributions prior to construction. In the selection of project counties, local&#13;
per capita income information was analyzed. The anticipated water tariffs were then&#13;
compared against the average income figures, which range from Y 400 to Y 1,360 per&#13;
capita per year. On average, annualized water fees are expected to represent less than 4&#13;
percent of beneficiary income, and in most cases less than 3 percent. Families with&#13;
below average incomes face a higher burden, or can hold costs down by reserving&#13;
improved water solely for drinking and cooking. The very poorest families can expect&#13;
village assistance in making water payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
6.14  The poorest will also receive village assistance in covering the capital&#13;
contribution. In contrast to incomes, little is known about asset holdings and the burden&#13;
of making the capital contribution is therefore difficult to analyze. Part of the capital cost&#13;
can be covered through in-kind contributions and families can further reduce charges by&#13;
opting out of household connections. In the ongoing rural water project, beneficiaries&#13;
with similar income profiles to those in this project have consistently demonstrated an&#13;
ability to make the needed capital contribution.&#13;
D. POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
6.15  Safe, convenient water and good hygiene practices alone will rarely lift a family&#13;
out of poverty. Yet, drinking contaminated water causes higher morbidity, particularly&#13;
among children, with attendant medical costs and lost production. Families interviewed&#13;
during project preparation report constant bouts of diarrhea among their members. They&#13;
similarly report that medical costs consume a high proportion of their cash income,&#13;
although the reported illnesses range well beyond those which are purely waterborne.&#13;
Time spent carrying water can directly reduce income generation in villages with&#13;
perennially or seasonally long journeys for water. As discussed above, this contributes&#13;
substantially to the WTP for improved supply. The improved water supply from this&#13;
project provides one of the several elements needed in a program to alleviate poverty.&#13;
This self-financing element yields a clear, immediate benefit that makes it appropriate as&#13;
a stand-alone effort.&#13;
6.16 Most rural Chinese communities do not consider carrying water to be "women's&#13;
work." Both men and women share that burden, although the fact that men are more&#13;
likely than women to be working away from home may mean that women will&#13;
disproportionately benefit from the planned water investment. Women do occupy the key&#13;
position in family hygienic practices, through preparing food, educating and caring for&#13;
children, and caring for sick family members. For that reason, the health and sanitation&#13;
education efforts will be targeted on them, using institutions such as the Women's&#13;
Federation that are able to more effectively reach women.  The previous two IDA-&#13;
financed rural water projects have generated village-level reports on benefits to women,&#13;
but no consistent impact evaluation has been undertaken. The monitoring work under the&#13;
proposed project will allow a more concrete evaluation to be done.&#13;
E. BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION&#13;
6.17  The fact that project beneficiaries must bear the entire cost of the water system,&#13;
including a substantial proportion of the upfront investment costs, means that their&#13;
concurrence must be obtained on project scope, key aspects of design such as whether&#13;
standpipes or household connections will be used to deliver water, and the related cost&#13;
issues. That concurrence is obtained through the village committee and therefore the&#13;
performance of that committee determines the nature of the participation.  Not&#13;
surprisingly, perfornance varies across villages. In the most participatory of villages, the&#13;
appraisal mission found that village committees had held all-village meetings in which&#13;
proposed designs and associated costs were discussed.  In more typical cases, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
committee itself had met, then committee members spread the information among&#13;
villagers. To highlight the importance of participation, each feasibility study must&#13;
include formal village committee approval of the preferred design option.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.18  The balance of the environmental impact is substantially positive; however,&#13;
potential adverse impacts from construction or a failure to protect water supply sources&#13;
require the classification of the project as Category B in terms of the Operational&#13;
Directive on Environmental Assessment. Annex 6 details the environmental mitigation&#13;
plan developed for the project. The project relies on a thorough review and supervision&#13;
process to ensure that environmental concerns are answered.&#13;
6.19  Chinese design manuals incorporate guidelines for proper water system&#13;
construction practices (i.e., minimal ground disturbance, source protection). For medium&#13;
and large systems, the county environmental protection bureau certifies that designs&#13;
incorporate environmental safeguards and that those safeguards are implemented.&#13;
County project offices provide supervision for smaller investments, with additional&#13;
oversight provided by the county quality assurance office. The provincial and national&#13;
project offices will also provide prior review and supplementary supervision of all larger&#13;
contracts and selected smaller contracts. The resettlement impact of the project will be&#13;
managed through a Resettlement Policy Framework (para. 3.22 and Annex 11).&#13;
G. ETHNIC MINORITIES&#13;
6.20  China's ethnic minorities make up approximately 6 percent of the country's total&#13;
population. The project covers a beneficiary population of 4.6 million, of whom a&#13;
projected 730,000, or 16 percent, are ethnic minorities. In Hebei and Yunnan Provinces&#13;
and Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, the three project provinces with significant&#13;
minority populations, the proportion of minorities benefiting from the project equals or&#13;
exceeds the proportion of minorities in the province. In Hebei, where the minority&#13;
population in the entire province is 3 percent, some 25 percent of project beneficiaries are&#13;
minorities, primarily Manchu; the project includes two "minority autonomous counties."&#13;
In Nei Mongol, 20 percent of the beneficiaries are Mongolian, approximately equal to&#13;
their proportion in the province as a whole; in Yunnan Province, where ethnic minorities&#13;
make up 32 percent of the provincial population, 56 percent of the project beneficiaries&#13;
are Yi, Bai, Hani and other ethnic minorities. Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces, which both&#13;
have very small minority populations, show proportional representation in the project&#13;
counties.&#13;
6.21  The choice of project provinces, counties, and villages has ensured a&#13;
disproportionately high minority beneficiary population. The project design leaves to&#13;
potential project villages the choice of whether or not to participate.  If they do&#13;
participate, they also have approval power over project designs. In Yunnan Province,&#13;
where the project covers an especially diverse group of ethnic minorities, the PHRD grant&#13;
will provide support for a study of the results of the health education component of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
RWSS, enabling the project office to tailor health education under the proposed project to&#13;
specific minority areas. This participation helps ensure that investments are socially and&#13;
culturally compatible with the development of beneficiary minority populations.&#13;
Therefore, the project design meets the requirements of Bank Group operational&#13;
directives related to minority peoples.&#13;
H. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.22   The proposed project faces and must mitigate a variety of risks. In evaluating the&#13;
magnitude of any particular project risk, the nature of the project must be considered.&#13;
Water, health, and sanitation investments are being made in thousands of villages in 40&#13;
counties over a five-year period.  The very diversity of this investment portfolio&#13;
minimizes overall project risks and provides an opportunity to learn during project&#13;
implementation, avoiding cumulative error. Yet the diversity also ensures that outliers&#13;
will occur-investments that perform very well or very badly compared to the average.&#13;
Another consideration is that this project is the second IDA rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation credit targeted on poor counties, with a basic framework quite similar to the&#13;
first project, so that the risk analysis draws on immediately comparable experience.&#13;
Based on experience under the ongoing project, the Association expects project risks to&#13;
be manageable. Opportunities exist to improve on earlier performance, but the bulk of&#13;
the previous investments have performed well.&#13;
6.23   The major risks are here grouped under three general headings: implementation&#13;
and operational risks, regulatory risks, and risks to long-term sustainability. Each type of&#13;
risk is also discussed in Annex 13. That discussion is summarized below:&#13;
Implementation and operational risks:&#13;
(a)    Project financing presents a risk due to the need for provincial, prefectural,&#13;
county, and beneficiary counterpart funding. The beneficiary funding&#13;
presents little risk, as systems would be allocated to those villages that are&#13;
most successful in fund collection. Here, then, only widespread loss of&#13;
income within a county, as could occur after, for example, a major flood,&#13;
would affect beneficiary financing.&#13;
Among the central, provincial, and local government levels, the local&#13;
governments have committed the highest percentage of counterpart funding,&#13;
averaging 23 percent of the total investment. Under RWSS, some counties&#13;
have caused financing delays through slow counterpart fund disbursement&#13;
and others have generally been unwilling to meet additional project costs&#13;
induced by foreign exchange rate changes. The first problem is endemic to&#13;
the financial system, wherein budget allocations are often made several&#13;
months into the financial year and, for discretionary payments, disbursement&#13;
often even later than that. The project has no answer to this problem, which&#13;
is self-correcting in the sense that the same delay occurs every year, but is&#13;
rarely cumulative. The proposed project disbursement profile reflects this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
experience. The foreign exchange risk problem is being addressed more&#13;
directly. In initial counterpart funding calculations, counties were required&#13;
to factor in Bank Group-estimated purchasing power parity foreign&#13;
exchange rates, hence generated higher counterpart funding estimates in&#13;
Yuan terms. County obligations to meet foreign exchange impacts during&#13;
the investment phase have also been emphasized by SPC and MOF.&#13;
(b)   Related to the large number of investments is the importance of the project&#13;
offices, of which there are 40 at county level, five provincial level and one&#13;
national.  These offices play key roles in project design, contracting,&#13;
supervision, and training. Analysis of the ongoing credit showed that the&#13;
supervision and training functions were generally compromised by lack of&#13;
funding.  The available funds go first to water supply design and&#13;
contracting, often leaving little available for the equally important&#13;
supervision and training. The proposed project remedies this risk through&#13;
explicit project office functions and budgeting, with attendant provision of&#13;
administrative funding. For specific problems, such as ICB procurement&#13;
delays due to staff inexperience with ICB requirements, foreign consultant&#13;
assistance is being provided. Training programs are being designed during&#13;
preparation with international consultant assistance. If these various efforts&#13;
do not live up to expectations, the outcome would be performance similar to&#13;
the current project, where overall design, construction, and operations&#13;
quality could be modestly improved and the health education work&#13;
substantially improved. However, despite some shortcomings, execution of&#13;
the current project is judged satisfactory.&#13;
(c)   The project financing createsforeign exchange and credit risks borne by the&#13;
provincial government. Under the project, once funds have been committed,&#13;
the village and county credit repayment obligations are fixed in Yuan terms&#13;
at the then-prevailing exchange rate. Foreign exchange risks are thereafter&#13;
shifted to provinces. This is important because the investments yield only a&#13;
local currency income stream and villages and counties have no instruments&#13;
available to mitigate the foreign exchange risk (unless they generate foreign&#13;
exchange through other operations-something rare for poor counties).&#13;
Although provinces also lack efficient mechanisms for handling these risks,&#13;
they typically control foreign exchange flows that are large relative to the&#13;
repayment requirements of the credit. Provincial assumption of these risks,&#13;
a necessary condition for participation in the credit, can be seen as a&#13;
provincial contribution to their poverty alleviation efforts. The risk has been&#13;
substantial during RWSS, where the Yuan has depreciated more than 50&#13;
percent since appraisal. The increased convertibility of the Yuan since that&#13;
time will reduce this risk.&#13;
(d)   The piped water systems will maintain independent accounts and generally&#13;
be managed as autonomous enterprises. The systems need efficient financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
and physical operation if water supply goals are to be met. The proposed&#13;
project bolsters training compared to that offered under the ongoing project&#13;
and provides for additional direct project office supervision. For the very&#13;
large projects, design review and audit requirements are also added. While&#13;
institutional innovation remains a project risk, that under the ongoing&#13;
project has been satisfactory, hence these risks are not judged great.&#13;
Regulatory risks:&#13;
(e)   Based on experience under RWSS, the major regulatory risk is that of&#13;
possible resistance to timely implementation of the required tariff structure&#13;
for water. Under RWSS, local price bureaus sometimes intervene to block&#13;
tariffs large enough to sustain water plant operations. Where this happens,&#13;
water company performance incentives are seriously impaired, as is their&#13;
ability to finance maintenance of the system. To mitigate this risk, tariff&#13;
estimates are made as part of the feasibility study. These, and the agreed&#13;
pricing formula as stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement, will be&#13;
reviewed by local price bureaus prior to an investment being made. If the&#13;
price bureau cannot accept the agreed tariff approach, investments will be&#13;
redirected to other villages or counties.&#13;
Risks to long-term sustainability:&#13;
(f)    The major risks to long-term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and&#13;
have been discussed above. Additional risks are environmental and may&#13;
arise from outside of the villages themselves. They center on excessive&#13;
extraction from or polluting inputs to the various surface and groundwater&#13;
sources used by the water systems. Excess pollutant loads could force either&#13;
expensive raw water treatment or a move to alternative sources. Either&#13;
outcome could increase costs sufficiently to exceed benefits. Feasibility&#13;
studies consider environmental risks, and if these are adequately done, and&#13;
needed source protection measures are taken, the risks will be minimized.&#13;
The water supply system feasibility studies under RWSS appear to do a&#13;
good job within at least a five-year horizon. Water sources used in the&#13;
RWSS project have shown no signs of quality deterioration. Despite that, in&#13;
areas of China losing water supply to depletion and pollution problems, the&#13;
rapidity and type of development often were simply not foreseen. Where&#13;
unanticipated development poses the greatest long-run threat, mitigation&#13;
depends more on a growing appreciation of the value of water as a resource&#13;
and of the importance of downstream impacts of water pollution than on&#13;
system-specific solutions. As water scarcity grows and more sources are&#13;
lost to pollution, China appears to be moving in that direction.&#13;
(g)   A more modest risk to long-term sustainability would arise from a failure of&#13;
the health and sanitation program to induce significant change in behavior.&#13;
Clean water supplies complemented by improved health and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
behavior produce the greatest benefits. However, behavioral changes will be&#13;
much more difficult to induce than clean water will be to supply. When&#13;
water systems function properly, water delivered to the household could be&#13;
directly consumed at no health risk and villagers may feel they can cease&#13;
boiling water. However, continued use of traditional water storage vessels is&#13;
likely and they pose the threat of reintroducing pathogens. Health education&#13;
will encourage regular cleaning of storage vessels and continued boiling of&#13;
water to guard against these problems. The health education program will&#13;
also stress water source protection, an issue spoken to in the previous&#13;
paragraph.  The sanitation work tries to reduce a different source of&#13;
pathogen loads, that from the traditional cycle of using human excrement as&#13;
a fertilizer, with transmission through the waste handling. Two means of&#13;
breaking the cycle will be addressed in the project. The first is hand&#13;
washing, itself facilitated by new water supplies. The second is the use of&#13;
composting toilets that destroy pathogens before the excrement is reused.&#13;
The project faces uncertainty over whether the existing Chinese approach to&#13;
health and sanitation work can be significantly improved upon. If not,&#13;
project areas would not realize gains from this component relative to&#13;
nonproject areas. Given the demonstrated difficulty of this work, the risk is&#13;
judged to be high. The project seeks to mitigate the risk through the use of a&#13;
KAP study to launch the work, complemented by monitoring to provide&#13;
feedback during the implementation period, allowing the program to be&#13;
modified throughout implementation.&#13;
&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that:&#13;
(a)   the provinces would complete the baseline surveys for villages receiving&#13;
new water supplies in 1998 and submit them to the NPO no later than&#13;
December 1, 1997. The NPO shall consolidate and analyze those surveys,&#13;
submitting them to IDA no later than January 1, 1998 (para. 3.5);&#13;
(b)   each CPO and PPO would prepare semiannual progress reports and submit&#13;
them to the NPO not later than one month following the end of the&#13;
reporting period. The NPO would prepare and submit a consolidated&#13;
semiannual progress report to the Association not later than two and one-&#13;
half months following the end of the reporting period. The first report&#13;
would cover two reporting periods, from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998&#13;
(para. 3.26);&#13;
(c)   the NPO would (i) prepare, not later than six months after the Closing&#13;
Date, or such later date to be agreed with the Association, a plan for the&#13;
future operation of the project; and (ii) afford the Association a reasonable&#13;
opportunity to exchange views on said plan (para. 3.26);&#13;
(d)   a mid-term review, to be undertaken no later than March 15, 2000, would&#13;
review progress in meeting project objectives, as reflected by the&#13;
monitoring indicators. The review will identify any changes needed to&#13;
meet those project objectives, including but not limited to allocation of&#13;
unallocated credit funds and commitment of additional counterpart funds&#13;
(para. 3.28);&#13;
(e)   the NPO  would appraise, using agreed criteria, all water supply&#13;
investments with an estimated total investment above Y 3.0 million for the&#13;
quality of their engineering and financial preparation and their overall&#13;
feasibility. Procurement of project related works would not commence&#13;
prior to successful NPO appraisal [para. 4.9(a)];&#13;
(f)   a consolidated project AWP for the following year would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than November 30 of&#13;
each year [para. 4.9(g)];&#13;
(g)   the following annual audits would be submitted to the Association no later&#13;
than six months after the end of the fiscal year:  (i) the national&#13;
consolidated account of project expenditures prepared by the NPO; and&#13;
(ii) SOEs and Special Account maintained by MOF. Additionally, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
following annual audits should be carried out and maintained at the&#13;
Provincial Finance Bureau for mission review: (i) provincial consolidated&#13;
accounts prepared by the PPO; and (ii) county accounts of project&#13;
expenditures carried out by the CPOs. To ensure better review of large-&#13;
scale water supply systems, each water plant facility with total investment&#13;
greater than Y 5 million will be audited at the end of its first full fiscal&#13;
year of operation in accordance with auditing principles consistently&#13;
applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, such audit&#13;
to be submitted to IDA for review no later than 6 months after the end of&#13;
the audited fiscal year (para. 5.14).&#13;
7.2    During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Provinces that:&#13;
(a)    during the investment phase, each level of government would bear any&#13;
foreign exchange risk in proportion to its originally agreed counterpart&#13;
contribution. The foreign exchange risk with respect to credit repayment&#13;
would be borne solely by the provinces (para. 3.11);&#13;
(b)   each province would carry out or cause to be carried out the resettlement&#13;
of persons affected by the project according to the agreed Resettlement&#13;
Policy Framework and in a manner satisfactory to the Association (para.&#13;
3.22);&#13;
(c)   the PPOs would appraise, using agreed criteria, all water supply&#13;
investments with an estimated total investment above Y 0.5 million and&#13;
not exceeding Y 3.0 million for the quality of their engineering and&#13;
financial preparation and their overall feasibility. Within the mandatory&#13;
review limits, procurement of project related works will not commence&#13;
prior to successful PPO appraisal [para. 4.1 0(a)];&#13;
(d)   provincial annual work plans for the following year would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the NPO for review and approval no later than October 15 of&#13;
each year [para. 4.10(d)];&#13;
(e)   for all water systems with total investment above Y 0.5 million, the county&#13;
quality assurance office would be retained to verify that construction&#13;
practices and standards have met design specifications [para. 4.1 1(a)]; and&#13;
(f)   commencing not later than the second full fiscal year of operations of such&#13;
investment, water charges will be established and collected annually at a&#13;
level sufficient to cover operations and maintenance costs, administrative&#13;
costs, taxes, and the greater of (i) interest charges and depreciation, or&#13;
(ii) debt service requirements (interest plus principle repayment) (para.&#13;
5.9).&#13;
7.3    With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable for an IDA&#13;
(ITF) Credit of SDR 51.4 million ($70 million equivalent) at standard terms with 35&#13;
years' maturity, to the People's Republic of China.&#13;

- 47 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
ANNEX 1: THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
YUNNAN PROVINCE&#13;
1.    Yunnan Province is located in southwest China and is bordered by the provinces&#13;
of Sichuan, Guizhou and Tibet Autonomous Region to the north, Guangxi Zhuang&#13;
Autonomous Region to the east, the countries of Vietnam and Lao PDR to the south, and&#13;
Myanmar to the west. It has a total land area of about 394,000 km2. Mountains and hilly&#13;
land cover 94 percent of the province; six major rivers (5,000 km total) and more than 40&#13;
lakes dot the remainder of the province's surface. In northwest Yunnan, the southeastem&#13;
Himalayas feed the upper reaches of three great rivers:  the Jingshajiang, which&#13;
discharges to the Yangtze; the Lancangjiang (Mekong); and the Nujiang (Salween). The&#13;
Pearl River also has its source in the northeast of the province. The westem landscape is&#13;
mountainous; central and eastem areas are comprised of plateaus, karst landscape, stone&#13;
forests and elevated lake basins.&#13;
2.    The climate in Yunnan Province ranges from temperate in the mountainous&#13;
northwest to subtropical in the central and eastem areas and monsoonal in the southern&#13;
reaches. Rainfall is plentiful, averaging annually over 1,000 mm in most of Yunnan and&#13;
ranging as high as 2,800 mm in the southwest and as low as 500 mm in the northwest; 60&#13;
percent of the rainfall occurs from June to August. The average temperature is 8 to 170C&#13;
in January, 11 to 290C in July. Underground water resources are abundant in the east,&#13;
west and south, and sparse in the north and central areas of the province.&#13;
3.    Yunnan Province has a population of some 40 million, of which about 83 percent,&#13;
or 33.4 million, live in rural areas. The province has the largest relative minority&#13;
population in China, with Yi, Bai, Hani and 20 other minority nationalities accounting for&#13;
nearly one-third of Yunnan's total population. Yunnan is among the poorest of China's&#13;
provinces, with 1995 rural incomes averaging Y 1,010, and urban per capita incomes&#13;
Y 3,690. Income in the project counties ranges from Y 395 to Y 978; all are nationally or&#13;
provincially designated poor counties. Over 20 percent of the population is illiterate or&#13;
semi-illiterate and only 43 percent have received a full primary school education.&#13;
4.   Improvements in the rural water sector over the last decade have been impressive:&#13;
while only 3.6 percent of Yunnan's rural drinking water, sourced primarily from shallow&#13;
wells and ponds, met quality standards in 1983, government intervention has increased&#13;
coverage by an average of 3.3 percent per year since then. By 1995, 59 percent of&#13;
Yunnan's rural population, or 19.6 million people, had access to improved water, about&#13;
equivalent to the national average. This included 36 percent with piped systems, 1.8&#13;
percent with deep-well hand pumps, and 20.7 percent using rainwater collectors. In the&#13;
project counties, however, improved water coverage is only 31 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
5.    Despite recent progress, water remains scarce in mountainous areas, and 16.2&#13;
million rural residents remain to be covered by improved water systems. Waterbome&#13;
disease rates are high, especially in the eastern part of the province, where shallow wells&#13;
are the main source of drinking water. Dysentery affects 60/100,000 people in the&#13;
province, with rates up to three times as high in some project counties; typhoid strikes&#13;
20/100,000 people in the province and up to 125/100,000 in some project counties, as&#13;
compared with 8/100,000 nationally. Provincial rates of schistosomiasis and fluorosis are&#13;
low overall, but some individual counties are severely affected. The child (under age 5)&#13;
mortality rate was 55/1,000 in 1995.&#13;
6.    Over 54 percent of rural families had household latrines in 1995, far lower than&#13;
the national average; however, only 9 percent of the population in the project area uses&#13;
sanitary latrines, and virtually none have composting models. Some Y 3.16 million has&#13;
been invested in health education to date, with classes primarily provided by local&#13;
hospitals and clinics, work units and schools. Thirty-five percent of primary schools and&#13;
20 percent of middle schools have health education classes.&#13;
7.    The national government has made water supply improvements a priority in&#13;
Yunnan, investing over Y 450 million in the sector since 1991.  The provincial&#13;
government has set aside a very small annual amount for the sector, while the rest of the&#13;
financing for improvements-an additional Y 430 million-has come from rural&#13;
collectives and individuals. Provincial goals for the Ninth Five-Year period are even&#13;
more ambitious, aiming to provide improved water supplies to 80 percent of rural&#13;
households and piped water to 60 percent, and composting latrines to 40 percent, by&#13;
2000. These improvements will require an average of 1.5 million people per year to be&#13;
given new access to clean water, and the same number to have installation of improved&#13;
latrines.&#13;
8.    Yunnan is one of six provinces participating in the World Bank Group's Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) project, implemented in 1992. By its completion,&#13;
the project will have invested Y 299 million to benefit 1.3 million people in seven&#13;
counties, with piped systems, deep-well hand pumps, and rainwater collectors.&#13;
9.    Another World Bank credit, the "Southwest Poverty Reduction Project"&#13;
(Cr. 2744), includes as part of its program a Y 25 million water supply component, which&#13;
will benefit an additional 155,800 people in the province. This project is scheduled for&#13;
completion in December 2001. Other water improvement schemes include a cooperative&#13;
project between the NPHCC, Provincial Conservancy Bureau, and UNICEF in three&#13;
Yunnan counties; this Y 13 million investment will supply 80,000 people with clean&#13;
water from 650 deep-well hand pumps.&#13;
10.   Project. The project would benefit 636,900 rural residents in six counties and&#13;
324 administrative villages, 56 percent of whom are minority nationalities. The total&#13;
investment of Y 183 million would include construction of 148 piped systems, 5 deep-&#13;
well hand pumps, and 9,965 rainwater collectors. The project would also provide funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
for construction of up to three household composting latrines per village and three public/&#13;
school latrines per county, as well as development of health education and training&#13;
programs. The project would raise total coverage in the province to 61 percent of the&#13;
rural population, and in the project counties to 63 percent.&#13;
HEBEI PROVINCE&#13;
11.   Hebei Province is located in the North China Plain, surrounding the municipalities&#13;
of Beijing and Tianjin. It covers an area of 187,000 km2 (2 percent of China's total) and&#13;
is bordered by Liaoning Province to the north, Shanxi to the west, Henan and Shandong&#13;
to the south, and the Bohai Sea to the east. The Hai River and its tributaries run through&#13;
the southern half of the province, and the Great Wall of China through the north. The&#13;
Jingyunhe Canal system flows from north to south near the eastern coast. Hebei supports&#13;
63.4 million people, or 5 percent of China's total. Thirty-five percent of the land is&#13;
arable; of the rest, 48 percent is mountainous or hilly, 15 percent forest, and 2 percent&#13;
rivers and lakes.&#13;
12.   Hebei has a continental monsoon climate, with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy&#13;
summers. The average temperature is 13.6°C, and there are between 120 and 200 frost-&#13;
free days per year. The average rainfall is 541 mm, concentrated in the summer months.&#13;
A combination of lakes, rivers, canals and reservoirs provide some 12 billion m3 of fresh&#13;
water per year, 9 billion of which are located in the central plain.&#13;
13.   Fifty-three million, or 84 percent, of Hebei's inhabitants are located in rural areas.&#13;
There is a minority population of about 2 million, mainly Hui, Mongolians, and&#13;
Manchurians, concentrated in the northeastern part of the province. Two of the proposed&#13;
project counties are Manchu minority counties. Agriculture, mostly cotton and wheat&#13;
production, is the main source of revenue. Rural per capita incomes averaged Y 1,669 in&#13;
1995, with an average annual income growth well above 25 percent for the five years up&#13;
to 1995. Urban income for the same year was approximately Y 3,674. The project&#13;
counties have average per capita rural incomes of Y 778 to Y 1,180; all are nationally-&#13;
designated poor counties.&#13;
14.   Hebei derives most of its drinking water from  groundwater sources.&#13;
Approximately 67 percent of the rural population have access to improved water, 32&#13;
percent (17 million) via piped systems and another 18 percent (9.6 million) via hand&#13;
pumps. An additional 17 percent (9 million) uses rainwater collectors. Villages with&#13;
piped systems are for the most part supplied by small, single-village plants, which&#13;
provide water for a limited number of hours each day. In 1996, UNICEF provided a $1&#13;
million grant for three counties in Hebei to further improve water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities.&#13;
15.   Some 26.6 million people in Hebei drink unimproved or marginally improved&#13;
water, while those villagers supplied by hand pumps and rainwater collectors continue to&#13;
suffer from frequent water shortages in the dry winter months. In the project counties,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
coverage is just 36 percent. The water in many areas carries high concentrations of&#13;
fluoride, with fluorosis affecting 167/100,000 in the province, and as many as 22 percent&#13;
of villagers in some project counties. Dysentery ranges from 9/100,000 in some project&#13;
counties to nearly 1,100/100,000 in others, compared with a provincial average of&#13;
110/100,000; viral hepatitis affects 92/100,000 rural residents in the province and ranges&#13;
up to 140/100,000 in some project counties.&#13;
16.   Fifteen percent of household latrines in rural Hebei provide composting treatment,&#13;
but just 5 percent in the project counties, or less than a third of the national average. In&#13;
recent years, the provincial government has promoted the improvement of sanitary&#13;
facilities; by the first half of 1996, some 6,000 households and 6,000 schools had&#13;
received sanitary latrines, with a total investment of Y 143 million (70 percent from the&#13;
beneficiaries). However, only 300 of the new facilities provided composting capabilities;&#13;
the rest range from the simplest unsealed pit variety to more sophisticated models.&#13;
17.   The NPHCC has been active in setting up provincial, prefectural and county-level&#13;
health education centers; however, the annual investment in health education still&#13;
averages less than Y 0.005 per capita. Most villages have at least one and usually two&#13;
public health officials, but little by way of formal health education.&#13;
18.   As part of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the provincial government hopes to raise&#13;
piped water coverage in the project counties to 45 percent of households by the year&#13;
2000. To cover these costs, villages have been encouraged to set aside 5 percent of their&#13;
net annual income for water plant construction costs and service fees. Provincial targets&#13;
for 2000 also include the provision of health education to all primary school students, and&#13;
to 80 percent of housewives, village leaders, and village doctors.&#13;
19.   Project. The project would provide Y 267 million to supply improved water&#13;
piped systems to 962,800 people in nine counties and 533 villages. This will nearly&#13;
double coverage in the project counties, to 66 percent, and raise the total provincial&#13;
coverage to 69 percent. The project would also fund the construction of no more than&#13;
three household latrines per village, and three school/public latrines per county, with the&#13;
development of complementary health education programs. Two of the project counties&#13;
are Manchu minority counties, and ethnic minorities make up 25 percent of provincial&#13;
project beneficiaries.&#13;
HUBEI PROVINCE&#13;
20.   Hubei Province is located in east-central China, bordered by Jiangxi and Anhui&#13;
Provinces to the east, Henan to the north, Sichuan and Shaanxi to the west, and Hunan to&#13;
the south. The Yangtze River bisects the eastern quarter of the province, curving east-&#13;
west to north-south; most of Hubei's cities are concentrated along the banks of the&#13;
Yangtze and its main tributary, the Han River. The eastern two-thirds of the province is a&#13;
low-lying plain (the Jianghan) drained by the two rivers. The western third is highlands&#13;
with valleys and basins dividing Hubei from neighboring Sichuan. Hubei covers&#13;
approximately 186,000 km2, and supports 58 million people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51-                       ANNEX 1&#13;
21.   Twenty-four percent of Hubei's land area is mountainous and dry, in the far west,&#13;
north and east; the rest of the province has a subtropical, monsoonal climate. There are&#13;
great variations in temperature, with cold, dry winters dropping as low as -10°C, and hot&#13;
rainy summers ranging as high as 430C. Average annual rainfall varies from 800 mm in&#13;
the north to 1,600 mm in the south. The area is abundant in water resources, with 1,190&#13;
rivers total, and 41.6 billion m3 of groundwater deposited annually.&#13;
22.   Seventy-eight percent of the population, or 45 million people, are rural&#13;
inhabitants. Some 3.7 percent (2 million) are ethnic minorities, primarily Tujia, Miao,&#13;
Hui and Dong.  Most minority nationalities live in the Enshui Tujia and Miao&#13;
Autonomous Prefecture and in Yichang City. The average annual per capita rural income&#13;
in the province was Y 1,800 in 1995, compared with Y 4,435 in urban areas; rural income&#13;
growth has slowed in the past two years, but still averaged over 16 percent in the five&#13;
years to 1995. In the project counties, average per capita incomes range from Y 1,016 to&#13;
Y 1,394; all are nationally or provincially designated poor counties.&#13;
23.   By the end of 1995, 58 percent of the total rural population, or 26.1 million&#13;
people, were served by improved water supplies, including 18 million (40 percent) with&#13;
piped systems and 8 million (18 percent) with shallow-well hand pumps. In the project&#13;
counties, coverage is just 34 percent, far lower than the national average. Rural residents&#13;
tend to limit their use of improved water supplies to drinking water; for washing and&#13;
feeding animals, they continue to draw water from local rivers or canals, or from&#13;
unprotected wells.&#13;
24.   Over 19 million people remain unserved by improved water supplies, and the&#13;
water they drink is visibly filthy. Furthermore, local water plants often do not have the&#13;
means to treat soluble substances, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and&#13;
fluoride. High disease rates are exacerbated by frequent flooding on the Jianghan Plain:&#13;
the average rate in rural areas of dysentery in 1995 was 1,045/100,000; typhoid&#13;
9.5/100,000; and viral hepatitis 88/100,000. About 5.4 percent of the rural population&#13;
suffers from schistosomiasis, and 0.2 percent from fluorosis. Incidence rates in some&#13;
project counties are much higher.&#13;
25.   The province has invested approximately Y 150 million in improved latrines and&#13;
nightsoil treatment since 1991, of which 10 percent was financed by local governments,&#13;
26 percent by collective units and 64 percent by individuals. While nearly 95 percent of&#13;
Hubei rural households have latrines, only 20 percent have "sanitary" coverage and 14&#13;
percent use composting latrines. Coverage of composting latrines in the project counties&#13;
is just 5 percent. Many rural latrines empty directly into the local river or canal, further&#13;
polluting the water. The use of nightsoil for fertilizer is widespread, but the waste is&#13;
rarely treated before use.&#13;
26.   Hubei is one of several provinces to participate in the 1994-95 and 1996-2000&#13;
China UNICEF Health Education Cooperation Projects, which provide health education&#13;
and training for housewives, school children and health professionals. The provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
government provides approximately Y 420,000 a year to the provincial health education&#13;
institute for the further development of health education, training and materials.&#13;
27.   The province has invested Y 1.3 billion in water supply improvements to date,&#13;
with about 25 percent coming from the local governments and 75 percent from&#13;
agricultural collectives and individuals. The provincial PHCC's "Ninth Five-Year Plan&#13;
and 2010 Long-Range Plan" sets the following targets: water improvement coverage in&#13;
rural areas would reach 85 percent by 2000, including piped system coverage of 45&#13;
percent by 2000 and over 70 percent by 2010. This suggests an annual coverage increase&#13;
of at least 1 to 2 percent per year.&#13;
28.   The provincial government has also set the ambitious target of 100 percent&#13;
sanitary latrine coverage in rural areas by the year 2000; of these, 50 percent are to be&#13;
composting latrines. The targets also aim for 100 percent health education in primary and&#13;
middle schools, as well as the establishment of health education institutes in 90 percent of&#13;
county towns, resulting in measurable behavioral changes by 2000.&#13;
29.   Project. This project would provide clean water for 1.23 million rural inhabitants&#13;
in 10 counties and 721 villages, raising total improved water coverage in the province to&#13;
59 percent and in the project counties to 47 percent. Of the investments, 171 would be&#13;
piped systems, serving 1.23 million people; 400 rainwater collectors would serve an&#13;
additional 2,000. The total investment for the province would be Y 284 million. The&#13;
project would also provide up to three demonstration household latrines per village and&#13;
three public or school latrines per county, as well as aiding in the development and&#13;
promotion of health education programs.&#13;
NEI MONGOL AUTONOMOUS REGION&#13;
30.   The Nei Mongol Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) stretches across China's&#13;
northeastern plain, in the southeastern part of the Mongolia Plateau. The region spans&#13;
2,000 km east-west and 1,700 km north-south. It borders Heilongjiang, Jilin, and&#13;
Liaoning Provinces to the east, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi to the south, Gansu and&#13;
Ningxia to the west, and Russia and Outer Mongolia to the north. Nei Mongol's total&#13;
land area is 1.2 million km2 (12.3 percent of China's total), including 4.9 million ha of&#13;
cultivated land and 86.7 million ha of grassland, the most in the country. More than half&#13;
the land area is over 1,000 m above sea level.&#13;
31.   Most areas of Nei Mongol suffer from very little and unevenly distributed rainfall.&#13;
Annual precipitation ranges from about 500 mm in the east to only 50 mm in the west,&#13;
while evaporation increases from 1,000 mm in the east to 3,000 mm to the west. Sunlight&#13;
is abundant, averaging 3,400 hours per year. Droughts are common and temperatures&#13;
extreme, ranging from -30°C to 39°C. In most areas, the frost-free period ranges from 80&#13;
to 150 days per year. Winters are very long and harsh; summers are often short and mild,&#13;
with a high concentration of rainfall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
32.   Of 22.8 million people in Nei Mongol, 14.1 million, or 62 percent, live in rural&#13;
areas. Despite its status as a minority autonomous region, only 4.6 million people (20&#13;
percent) are ethnic minorities, of which 3.7 million are Mongolian. The minority&#13;
population is concentrated in four counties, and makes up less than 3 percent of the&#13;
population outside of those counties. Average rural per capita income in the region in&#13;
1995 was Y 1,208, with urban per capita incomes averaging Y 2,860. Rural incomes&#13;
have grown slowly compared with China's coastal regions, at 4.4 percent per year. The&#13;
project counties are considerably poorer, with average rural per capita incomes between&#13;
Y 720 and Y 960. All project counties but one are nationally or provincially designated&#13;
poor counties; the last has extraordinarily high rates of disease due to chemical&#13;
contaminants in the water.&#13;
33.   As of 1995, 62 percent (8.8 million) of the rural population had access to&#13;
improved water supply, about equal to the national average. This included 24 percent&#13;
(3.4 million people) with piped systems, 34 percent (4.8 million) served by hand pumps,&#13;
and 4 percent (627,000) through rainwater collectors. However, coverage is very uneven,&#13;
standing at just 14 percent in the project counties. For much of the population, water is&#13;
quite scarce, with many households spending several hours per day fetching water, and&#13;
high in chemical concentrations; the average pH of the water in project counties was&#13;
around 8.1, and many village water supplies contain dangerously high levels of fluoride&#13;
and arsenic.&#13;
34.   Due to the arid climate, waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid are not&#13;
as prevalent in Nei Mongol as in the south. However, hepatitis is quite common,&#13;
affecting 71/100,000 in the region, and as many as 430/100,000 in the project counties;&#13;
dysentery strikes between 450 and 580/100,000 in the project counties, as compared with&#13;
35/100,000 in the region as a whole. Nine percent of Nei Mongol's rural residents suffer&#13;
from fluorosis; in the project counties, between 6 and 17 percent of the population is&#13;
affected. Arsenic poisoning is prevalent in nine counties, with some 300,000 people in&#13;
Nei Mongol suffering from visible skin cancer and "speckled tooth" disease. In some of&#13;
the project villages visited, the rate of arsenic poisoning was as high as one-third,&#13;
afflicting villagers of all ages. Drainage systems in the project counties are almost&#13;
nonexistent, and as a result the soil is highly and visibly saline. Chemical fertilizers&#13;
further pollute the water.&#13;
35.   Sanitation practices in Nei Mongol are the least sophisticated of the project&#13;
provinces; nearly 34 percent of the population do not have household latrines at all, and&#13;
those latrines that are built tend to be very simple, often just an enclosed area without&#13;
even a pit. Some villages have as low as 10 percent latrine coverage, and there are&#13;
virtually no sanitary (0.6 percent) or composting (2.8 percent) latrines.  The low&#13;
population density means that nightsoil is not generally collected for fertilizer. Under&#13;
RWSS, Y 3.42 million was invested in building a number of household and public&#13;
latrines in Nei Mongol project counties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
36.   Most counties provide basic health education through the primary and secondary&#13;
schools; several counties also participated in the UNICEF "Knowledge for Life" program&#13;
in 1994-95. The materials used are generated at the provincial/regional level and&#13;
standardized throughout the region. Some Y 406 million was invested in health care and&#13;
education in 1995.&#13;
37.   From 1990 to 1995, the regional government invested over Y 183 million in water&#13;
supply improvement. This effort is expected to be modestly expanded as part of the&#13;
region's Ninth Five-Year Plan, in which the regional government proposes a total&#13;
investment of Y 1.1 billion, including World Bank Group loans and individual&#13;
contributions, to supply water to 5.2 million additional beneficiaries by the year 2000.&#13;
38.   Under this plan, 70 percent of the rural population will benefit from improved&#13;
water supply by 2000, including 52 percent (7.3 million people) with access to piped&#13;
water supply. In sanitation, targets include 10 percent composting latrine coverage by&#13;
2000; in health education, 80 percent of primary school students and 70-80 percent of&#13;
housewives are to receive training.&#13;
39.   This regional strategy takes into account three major projects: First, Nei Mongol&#13;
was one of six provinces included in the World Bank RWSS Project. This project, which&#13;
carries a total investment in Nei Mongol of Y 211 million, will have provided 548 water&#13;
systems to 1.3 million villagers by the its completion in 1998. Second, the region's "380&#13;
Engineering Plan," with a total investment of Y 836 million between 1996 and 2000, will&#13;
provide improved water systems for 3.8 million villagers and livestock, at an average per&#13;
capita cost of Y 300-350. The proposed project is the third element of this strategy.&#13;
40.   Project. This project would carry a total investment in Nei Mongol of Y 167&#13;
million. It would benefit 640,300 rural residents in 1,060 villages and six counties,&#13;
including 20 percent ethnic minorities. This involves construction of 743 small-scale&#13;
piped water systems to supply 621,700 people, and 80 deep-well hand pumps for the&#13;
remaining 18,600. The project would also support the construction of up to three&#13;
household latrines in each of the project villages, and the further development of health&#13;
education and training.&#13;
JIANGXI PROVINCE&#13;
41.   Jiangxi Province is located in southeastern China, stretching 620 km north to&#13;
2&#13;
south and 490 km east to west, with a total land area of 166,900 km . Bordering it are&#13;
Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces to the east, Guangdong to the south, Hunan to the west,&#13;
and Hubei and Anhui to the north. Four-fifths of the province's area is mountainous or&#13;
hilly, with plains in the north. Jiangxi is rich in water resources, with more than 160&#13;
year-round rivers and nearly 2,400 periodic ones, with a total length of some 18,400 km&#13;
and flow of 138 billion cm3. The largest river, the Ganjiang, has a flow almost as great as&#13;
that of the Yellow River. These rivers flow into China's largest freshwater lake, the&#13;
Poyang, which then discharges to the Yangtze. The province is warm and wet, with an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                      ANNEX I&#13;
average rainfall between 1,340 and 1,930 mm annually and mean temperatures ranging&#13;
from 16.2 to 19.7°C.&#13;
42.   The province has a total population of 41 million, with 32 million (74 percent)&#13;
living in rural areas. Just 0.1 percent of Jiangxi's population is non-Han; of these, the&#13;
She are the largest nationality, concentrated in three minority autonomous townships.&#13;
Average rural per capita income in 1995 was Y 1,537, as compared with Y 3,046 in urban&#13;
areas; in the five years to 1995, rural per capita incomes have grown at an average of 25&#13;
percent per year. Per capita income in the project counties ranges from Y 620 to Y 1,320;&#13;
all are nationally or provincially designated poor counties. The provincial government&#13;
has been active in promoting water supply improvements, investing Y 330 million during&#13;
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period to cover 56 percent of the population by 1995. Of&#13;
these, 9.4 million people (29 percent) have access to piped water, and another 8.5 million&#13;
(27 percent) use hand pumps. The remaining 14 million rural residents draw most of&#13;
their water from large-mouth wells and streams, which are often polluted.&#13;
43.   Waterborne diseases are especially prevalent in Jiangxi, with dysentery afflicting&#13;
approximately 112/100,000 people; viral hepatitis and typhoid strike 55/100,000 and&#13;
10/100,000, respectively. In the project counties, hepatitis and dysentery occur up to&#13;
twice as frequently in some areas. Schistosomiasis was extremely prevalent in the past,&#13;
reaching epidemic proportions in 1995; while health campaigns have decreased the&#13;
numbers substantially, 12 counties still report high incidence rates of the disease. Eight&#13;
million people in the province, or 20 percent of the population, suffer from fluorosis;&#13;
rates in some project counties are as high as 35 percent.&#13;
44.   A sample conducted in 1995 of latrine use and waste disposal in the province&#13;
indicated that while most households have simple latrines, only 32 percent, mostly in&#13;
county towns, have sanitary latrines, and only 6.6 percent use composting models. This&#13;
is a substantial improvement over a survey conducted two years earlier, but treatment of&#13;
nightsoil before use remains uncommon. Jiangxi has set up 15 independent "health&#13;
education units" in the province, and each township EPS has its own health education&#13;
section.&#13;
45.   The provincial government plans to provide 95 percent of the rural population&#13;
with access to improved water supplies, and 50 percent with piped water, by 2001. To&#13;
assist in this effort, the Provincial Planning Commission, local water, construction, health&#13;
and financial departments, and county water companies plan to invest over Y 50 million&#13;
in the next five years, to be matched 3:1 by the beneficiaries. The total beneficiaries from&#13;
these efforts would be 11 million: 5.4 million previously unserved will be provided&#13;
access to piped, pumped or rainwater collector water, and another 5.6 million well-water&#13;
drinkers will upgrade their service to piped water.&#13;
46.   In addition, Ninth Five-Year planning calls for 50 percent improvement of&#13;
latrines, with 21.5 million household and public sanitary latrines to be built. The&#13;
construction of latrines will be especially emphasized in villages along major state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
highways, the Jing-jiu railway line, and epidemic areas of schistosomiasis. Sixty percent&#13;
of women and 80 percent of primary school students are to receive at least 0.5 hours/&#13;
week of basic health education.&#13;
47.   Project. The IDA credit would be used to provide clean drinking water to 1.14&#13;
million rural inhabitants of Jiangxi in nine counties and 441 villages, with a total&#13;
investment of Y 207 million; 0.5 percent of the beneficiaries are ethnic minorities. All&#13;
161 water supply investments would be piped water systems, generally medium-size&#13;
(under Y 2 million). In addition, the project would provide financing for up to three&#13;
demonstration latrines in each village and three public or school latrines per county.&#13;
Health education and training programs will also be developed.&#13;

ANNEX 2: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    On the whole, rural Chinese live longer and suffer less illness than they did two&#13;
decades ago. Better nutrition and higher immunization rates have contributed to those&#13;
gains; so also have substantial improvements in rural water supply. Between 1985 and&#13;
1995, the number of rural residents with convenient access to safe water more than&#13;
doubled, to some 520 million, or 57 percent of China's 920 million rural people. Of&#13;
these, approximately 400 million people (43 percent) presently drink piped water; about&#13;
half of the 205 million relying on hand pumps and rainwater collectors can also be&#13;
considered to have a safe supply. The remainder use a variety of sources, including&#13;
springs, rivers, and ponds.&#13;
2.    Despite recent progress, over 400 million rural Chinese continue to suffer from&#13;
unsafe or insufficient water supplies. Problems include water sources with high pathogen&#13;
loads due to fecal or other contamination; water with high levels of fluoride, arsenic, or&#13;
salts; and seasonal water shortages. In China, as in other countries, the lack of safe water&#13;
correlates highly with poverty. Also positively correlated with poverty are behaviors that&#13;
worsen water-related disease. Examples include failure to protect the wells from&#13;
contamination, boil water before drinking, or wash hands before preparing or eating food.&#13;
As a result, many poor rural people suffer from common diarrheal diseases and helminth&#13;
infections and, more rarely, dysentery, hepatitis, typhoid and cholera.&#13;
3.    Water Supply. To maintain momentum gained during the United Nations&#13;
"International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade" (1981-90), China set 1995&#13;
rural water supply goals at 35 to 50 percent coverage of drinking water meeting&#13;
international quality standards, including 35 to 40 percent of rural residents receiving&#13;
piped water supplies. Both goals were met and even more ambitious goals established for&#13;
2000, with the government hoping to provide 65 percent safe water and 50 percent piped&#13;
water coverage in rural areas by the turn of the century. This plan will necessitate&#13;
improving water supplies at over 1.5 percent, or more than 12 million people per year.&#13;
The earlier investments were targeted at the most easily solved problems. Those now&#13;
needing help include 50 million suffering from long-term water scarcity, and 40 million&#13;
drinking water with excessive levels of fluoride; the remainder drink saline or alkaline&#13;
water, or water with high concentrations of bacteria, viruses, and parasites.&#13;
4.    Of the total rural population that is adequately served, over 75 percent presently&#13;
get their water through piped systems. Although basically all of the piped water supplies&#13;
have been deemed safe, hand pumps and other sources do not always reach that goal.&#13;
Construction and maintenance costs per person for piped systems are often higher than&#13;
&#13;

convenient and easy to operate and maintain, as well as being superior in quality. These&#13;
systems are built at an average cost of Y 150-200 per person. In the future, the&#13;
government plans to move many of the rural people presently supplied by point sources&#13;
to piped water systems.&#13;
5.    Sanitation and Health Education. Poor sanitary conditions and unhygienic&#13;
practices in rural China exacerbate health problems created by a lack of clean water. By&#13;
1995, some 80 percent of rural households had some sort of household latrine. However,&#13;
most of these facilities are rudimentary at best: they provide temporary storage of wastes&#13;
and are unprotected from flies and other insect vectors of disease transmission. Sixteen&#13;
percent of the rural population uses "sanitary" latrines, usually defined as latrines with&#13;
full walls and roof, odorless and insect-free; an additional 18 percent has access to&#13;
composting latrines that promise high rates of pathogen destruction. These composting&#13;
latrines are quite expensive compared with the average income in the poorer rural areas,&#13;
and their spread has been slow. The availability of public and school latrines is low.&#13;
They rarely meet the "sanitary" standard and most have no water available for hand-&#13;
washing after use.  Wastes are collected and transported to the fields for use in&#13;
agriculture, often without further treatment. The use of human waste for fertilizer is a&#13;
traditional practice, and will undoubtedly continue. The main objectives of sanitation&#13;
improvements are therefore to improve the standard of latrines and to make reuse&#13;
practices more hygienic.&#13;
6.    In most rural areas, a network of National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee&#13;
workers, Women's Federation representatives, local epidemic prevention stations (EPSs),&#13;
and schools have led health education campaigns encouraging a wide array of hygienic&#13;
behaviors. That work, combined with a high literacy rate (even in poor areas), has led to&#13;
widespread knowledge of many basic health behaviors, such as the importance of&#13;
drinking boiled water. However, actual behavioral change has been slow to follow,&#13;
especially in poor areas where fuel may be scarce and understanding of the link between&#13;
raw water or unwashed hands and diarrhea is tenuous at best. Thus, what is needed is&#13;
more effective delivery and content of health messages, rather than a greater number of&#13;
people receiving them.&#13;
7.    Though widespread, health education in most rural areas provides little concrete&#13;
information to link hygienic behavior to improved health. Programs usually consist only&#13;
of the provision of textbooks to primary school students and some distribution of hygiene&#13;
information through mass media, such as radio programs and health bulletins. Teachers&#13;
receive little training in the delivery of classroom materials. Activities in the provincial&#13;
and recently established district health education institutions are often carried out on an&#13;
ad hoc basis by personnel who are in the majority doctors, not health education&#13;
specialists. To overcome this problem, some provinces have initiated specific programs&#13;
for health educators at medical universities, but most provinces still lack such specialized&#13;
training.&#13;

PROJECT AREA SELECTION&#13;
8.    An estimated 4.6 million inhabitants of 40 project counties in Yunnan, Jiangxi,&#13;
Hubei and Hebei Provinces and Nei Mongol Autonomous Region would benefit from the&#13;
project. The proposed project provinces and autonomous region (hereafter referred to as&#13;
the provinces) all contain a large number of poor counties with substantial unmet safe&#13;
water needs. Participating counties were selected according to their: (a) rural poverty, in&#13;
which the poorest counties were given first rights of participation; (b) percentage of rural&#13;
people lacking access to improved water supplies; (c) number of people exposed to&#13;
unsafe water, as evidenced by fluoride or alkali content, or by the incidence of&#13;
gastrointestinal illness; (d) existing provincial plans targeting priority areas of rural water&#13;
improvement; (e) demonstrated ability to provide the needed counterpart funds; and&#13;
(f) willingness to form and staff a county project office to agreed standards.  All&#13;
participating counties are either among the nationally- or provincially-designated poor&#13;
counties, or have particularly severe health problems resulting from poor water quality.&#13;
9.    Further details on project provinces and counties, and on their water supply and&#13;
sanitation sector goals, can be found in Annex 1.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
10.   The project design links physical investment in safe water supply systems with&#13;
provision of related health education messages and access to sanitation information and&#13;
demonstration facilities, in order to maximize health and productivity improvements&#13;
within the beneficiary population.  The project also supports training in project&#13;
management and water system operations to ensure sustainability. Although related in&#13;
impact, each of the three components will be described separately below:&#13;
The Water Supply Component ($116.4 million)&#13;
11.   The water supply component will give villagers in all 40 counties the opportunity&#13;
to invest in improved water supplies. No constraints are set on the type of system chosen,&#13;
which can range from the household-specific solutions of rainwater collectors or shallow&#13;
or deep-well hand pumps, to single- or multivillage community piped systems.&#13;
Households can choose whether to invest in individual household connections or to rely&#13;
on community standposts.&#13;
12.   Piped Water Supply Systems. Piped water supply systems will serve 98 percent&#13;
of the approximately 4.6 million project beneficiaries. Over 1,450 water facilities will be&#13;
constructed, all of which are planned to provide direct household connections. The&#13;
continuing shift from hand pumps to piped systems with household connections that has&#13;
been occurring since the first rural water supply project reflects both consumer demand&#13;
for the convenience and status afforded by individual household water taps and their&#13;
willingness to pay up front the additional costs. Of the 1,457 proposed systems, 1,202&#13;
will use groundwater sources, and only 255 will be surface water systems. Spring water&#13;
sources are the most cost-effective because the water is usually of good quality and no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
treatment, apart from disinfection, is necessary. Often, spring systems can be gravity-fed,&#13;
removing the need for storage tanks and pumps. Surface water systems are usually the&#13;
most costly because water treatment is required, as is pumping to storage tanks to&#13;
maintain system pressure. Nearly three-quarters of the systems are small-scale (less than&#13;
Y 0.5 million investment), about 400 are medium-scale (Y 0.5 million to Y 3 million) and&#13;
only 29 are large-scale (over Y 3 million).&#13;
13.  In the first-year program, 131 piped systems (108 groundwater and 23 surface&#13;
water) are proposed for construction, after which 533,600 rural residents would have&#13;
access to safe drinking water. First-year systems are mostly small-scale.&#13;
14.   Nonpiped Water Supply Systems. The proposed project also contains several&#13;
alternative low-cost water supply technologies (point sources) to serve communities&#13;
where population is sparse and/or ground and surface water is scarce. The proposed&#13;
project would construct 10,365 household rainwater collectors and 85 deep-well hand&#13;
pumps.  These systems would collectively serve 71,400 beneficiaries.  Rainwater&#13;
collectors are primarily used in the mountainous regions of Hubei and Yunnan, where&#13;
rainfall is plentiful, but access to surface water is difficult. Jiangxi and Hebei provinces&#13;
do not plan to construct any nonpiped systems.&#13;
15.  In the first-year program 450 rain collectors will be constructed, serving 2,300&#13;
people.&#13;
16.   Planning and Design Criteria. The piped water supply systems proposed in the&#13;
project have been selected as the least-cost solutions. The criteria used in the design of&#13;
the piped systems are based on the China Rural Water Supply Engineering and&#13;
Construction Technical Manual prepared by NPHCCO. Per capita domestic water&#13;
consumption is assumed to range between 40 to 80 liters per day depending on the&#13;
sufficiency of the water sources and the climatic conditions. For animals and other uses,&#13;
a consumption allowance of 10 liters per day is used. For nonpiped systems 30 to 40&#13;
liters per capita per day are considered adequate design demands. A design period of 15&#13;
years is selected (10 for some of the smallest plants) and the annual population growth is&#13;
taken as 1.2 percent. A factor of 1.5 is used for maximum day demand and the peak hour&#13;
demand factor applied varies from 2.5 to 4.0. The minimum system design pressure in&#13;
the pipe network must be not less than 5 meters. Nonpiped water supply systems use the&#13;
design criteria specified in the China Rural Water Supply Construction Manual.&#13;
The Sanitation and Health Education Component ($11.5 million)&#13;
17.   Benefits of improved water supply and better sanitation can only be maximized if&#13;
they are supported by an adequate level of education and training to promote a better&#13;
understanding of the importance of health and hygiene. Because of the high cost of many&#13;
composting latrine models, and the lack of perceived link between sanitation and&#13;
improved health conditions, many villagers opt not to improve their latrines despite&#13;
campaigns encouraging them to invest in improved models. Poor sanitation coverage is&#13;
exacerbated by lack of hygienic behavior; although national and local campaigns have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
raised rural awareness of basic health/hygienic practices, rural people continue to drink&#13;
unboiled water, do not wash their hands before eating, and rarely clean water storage&#13;
containers. This component focuses on the need to change attitudes toward and practice&#13;
of water- and waste-related practices, rather than simply educating a target number of&#13;
people.&#13;
18.  In the five project provinces, only in Hubei is sanitary latrine coverage higher than&#13;
national average, and in all five, composting latrine coverage is lower (see Table 1). The&#13;
high cost of composting latrines discourages many poorer rural households from&#13;
installing them.&#13;

Component Objectives&#13;
19.   The component seeks to help maximize the opportunities for reducing the&#13;
incidence of waterborne disease in three ways: (a) make available information on&#13;
improved latrine designs, their investment costs and economic and health benefits by&#13;
sponsoring village information sessions about water supply, improved latrines, and&#13;
related hygiene practices; (b) finance improved latrine facilities on a demonstration basis&#13;
in project village schools and in one to three households in each project village; and&#13;
(c) identify specific types of behavioral change that will improve health conditions,&#13;
finance the preparation of health education materials and finance support to local health&#13;
networks to expand and upgrade existing health education information programs in the&#13;
project areas, increase local media coverage of health issues, make health educational&#13;
materials accessible to more rural people, and train additional local health experts.&#13;
Proposed Activities&#13;
20.   The component would comprise:&#13;
(a)   Monitoring Indicators Study. Through the PHRD grant, the NPO will&#13;
employ consultants to assist in identifying 5 to 10 monitoring indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
for the improvement of hygiene-related behavior, through field surveys in&#13;
sample project villages.&#13;
(b)   KAP (Knowledge-Attitude-Practice) Study. The NPO will develop and&#13;
carry out a study to provide better understanding of the hygienic practices&#13;
of villagers in project areas; the results will be used to develop new health&#13;
and sanitation messages and materials for dissemination in all project&#13;
villages.&#13;
(c)   Training. The NPO and CPOs will provide health education training to&#13;
local leaders, including primary school teachers, village doctors, and&#13;
Women's Federation representatives.&#13;
(d)   Health Education. The NPO will develop, and provincial and county&#13;
project offices and local leaders will implement, an education information&#13;
program that will emphasize the importance of behavioral change and the&#13;
link between hygienic practice and improved health primarily to&#13;
housewives, young women and school children.  Development of&#13;
education materials will be done with the assistance of the China Health&#13;
Education Institute. The information program will be implemented in four&#13;
phases: Phase I-awareness of project objectives; Phase II-awareness of&#13;
environmental protection and sanitation promotion; Phase III-water&#13;
utilization; and Phase IV-hygienic behavior. Phases I and II of the health&#13;
information program would be implemented in project villages prior to the&#13;
construction of water supply schemes in each village, and Phases III and&#13;
IV during and after the construction period.&#13;
(e)   Construction of Three Household Composting Latrines. For those&#13;
villagers willing and able to construct improved household latrines at their&#13;
own expense, CPOs and county/municipal sanitary and epidemic&#13;
prevention stations will provide technical assistance. Where villagers are&#13;
able to contribute at least half the cost of an improved latrine in labor and&#13;
materials, but not the full capital cost, the project will make a limited&#13;
amount of funding available to each village to assist in purchasing inputs,&#13;
for no more than three household latrines per village. The latter expenses&#13;
will be covered either by beneficiaries, IDA financing or government&#13;
grants. Only those households that are able to pay part of the cost of the&#13;
latrine will be supported under this component, to avoid providing models&#13;
that cannot be followed without subsidies. Construction in model villages&#13;
would be supported under this project only as long as the investment&#13;
would cover only additional village school latrines and household&#13;
composting latrines, under the same criteria as above, and the total&#13;
expenditures on model villages would not be at the expense of health and&#13;
sanitation education in any other project villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
(f)   Construction of Three to Five Village School Composting Latrines. In&#13;
each project county, the CPO will select three to five villages to receive&#13;
public school composting latrines.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
21.   Technical assistance would be provided through the PHRD grant and through&#13;
project funds for international and local consultants to assist the NPO and PPOs in&#13;
carrying out the monitoring indicators study, KAP and baseline surveys. The consultants&#13;
for the monitoring indicators study would be employed by May 30, 1997, and the study&#13;
completed by August 31, 1997. The consultants for the KAP study would be employed&#13;
by November 1, 1997.&#13;
Schedule&#13;
22.   The PHRD study of project monitoring indicators would be carried out from&#13;
June 1 through August 31, 1997. Starting at the same time, the Yunnan PPO will carry&#13;
out an evaluation of the sanitation and health education components of RWSS ethnic&#13;
minority areas. The results of this study will be provided to the PHRD consultants no&#13;
later than July 31, 1997, to enable the consultants to take any ethnic differences into&#13;
account in their work.&#13;
23.   The terms of reference for the baseline survey and KAP study would be included&#13;
in the final recommendations of the project monitoring indicator study. The field work&#13;
for the baseline survey would be carried out by CPO staff, beginning no later than&#13;
October 1, 1997. The final report for the baseline survey would be prepared by the NPO&#13;
and submitted to IDA for review by December 31, 1997.&#13;
24.   The consultants for the KAP study will be selected and employed by November 1,&#13;
1997. The field work would be carried out during December 1997-March 1998, and the&#13;
final report prepared by the NPO and submitted to IDA for review no later than April 30,&#13;
1998.&#13;
25.   The NPO would prepare materials for the first two phases of the health education&#13;
component on the basis of existing information, in order to begin training-of-trainers for&#13;
the first-year program no later than January 1, 1998. The health education information&#13;
program for Phases I and II would be carried out in all first-year villages by the beginning&#13;
of the construction season in March/April, 1998. The NPO would use the findings of the&#13;
KAP study to develop targeted, specific health education messages, and would prepare&#13;
materials and begin to implement training for Phases III and IV of the health education&#13;
information program by September 1998.&#13;
The Project Management Component ($6.1 million)&#13;
26.   The project management component comprises (a) the establishment and&#13;
maintenance of the county, province and national project offices; (b) technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
and training for project office personnel; (c) financing of project management and&#13;
supervision activities; and (d) development and implementation of baseline surveys.&#13;
Establishment and Maintenance of Project Offices&#13;
27.   The existing National Project Office, five provincial project offices, and 40&#13;
county project offices will operate during the implementation period of the project to&#13;
carry out day-to-day project activities. The following physical assets will be required to&#13;
support this work:&#13;
(a)   Office Space. At the provincial and county levels, if new facilities are&#13;
required, space will be rented, or provided free of charge if the project will&#13;
be operating out of a government building; no dormitories will be funded&#13;
under this project.&#13;
(b)   Warehouses. At the county level, warehouses will be rented, or, if&#13;
suitable facilities are not available, construction of adequate warehouses&#13;
will be funded through the project. If credit proceeds are to be used to&#13;
construct warehouses, IDA review is required.&#13;
(c)   Vehicles and Office Equipment. These items will be procured through&#13;
the project if such equipment is not already available.&#13;
(d)   Operating Expenses. These include communication, transportation and&#13;
stationary costs to be funded by the project.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training for Project Management Office Staff&#13;
28.   The national, provincial and county project offices with a full complement of staff&#13;
will employ approximately 750 persons to implement this project. To maximize their&#13;
participation, training and technical assistance will be provided in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Procurement. Annual assistance by qualified procurement personnel will&#13;
be provided to the NPO to improve preparation of ICB bidding&#13;
documents. The CPOs and PPOs will receive ongoing procurement&#13;
training from the NPO, particularly on procuring civil works contracts and&#13;
on preparation of ICB bidding documents. There are approximately 79&#13;
procurement staff who will require this training.&#13;
(b)   Project Management. Provincial and county project office directors and&#13;
deputies will be trained by the NPO in human resource management,&#13;
project scheduling, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, supervision,&#13;
budgeting, and funds management. PPOs will have additional follow-up&#13;
training sessions for the CPOs. Approximately 107 management staff will&#13;
participate in these sessions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
(c)   Finance and Accounting. The NPO will train all PPO and CPO financial&#13;
project staff on the accounting system used to track project expenditures,&#13;
maintenance of supporting documentation, preparation of financial reports,&#13;
and processing of disbursement and Special Account reimbursement&#13;
requests. PPOs and CPOs will also be trained in financial management&#13;
aspects of water utilities and financial analysis of water supply system&#13;
options.  There are approximately 200 financial staff requiring this&#13;
training.&#13;
(d)   Water Plant Engineering and Operations. Approximately 141 project&#13;
office engineering staff will require training in water plant site selection,&#13;
hydrogeological surveying, construction management, water plant&#13;
operations management and water quality monitoring. The NPO will&#13;
design all training programs and carry out initial training, with follow-up&#13;
training provided by the PPOs. Technical assistance from county and&#13;
provincial design institutes to review and prepare some water facility&#13;
engineering designs, as well as from construction supervision bureaus to&#13;
supervise construction works will be required.&#13;
(e)   Sanitation and Health Education. Approximately 132 personnel will&#13;
require training in the design of health education programs, composting&#13;
latrine designs, costs and benefits, latrine construction supervision, and&#13;
knowledge-attitude-practice and surveying techniques. The NPO will&#13;
conduct the initial training, with follow-up training to be provided by the&#13;
PPos.&#13;
29.   The costs include technical assistance and training-related organizational and&#13;
administration costs incurred at the national, provincial and county levels.&#13;
Project Management and Supervision&#13;
30.   Over 1,400 piped and 11,000 nonpiped water facilities will be constructed, and&#13;
the project beneficiaries will receive training to improve their health and hygiene and&#13;
sanitation practices. To oversee the successful implementation of these investments, the&#13;
national, provincial and county project offices will need to spend the majority of their&#13;
resources on design review, supervision of project implementation, and project&#13;
monitoring, evaluation and reporting. These activities are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Design Review. To facilitate PPO assessment of CPO engineering and&#13;
financial capabilities, each PPO is expected to conduct site review of each&#13;
of the first three water supply system designs in each county, or the full&#13;
county first-year work program, whichever is greater. In each subsequent&#13;
year, the PPO will conduct site review of no fewer than 20 water supply&#13;
systems per year, including all systems with estimated total costs above&#13;
Y 500,000 and at least two systems below the mandatory review limit size.&#13;
The reviews will include all engineering factors, as well as the financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
analysis and counterpart funding plans. All mandatory reviews are&#13;
expected to be carried out in the field. The NPO will conduct mandatory&#13;
review of all systems with estimated total investment costs above Y 3&#13;
million and not fewer than 12 of the largest provincial systems in any&#13;
given year, such review to occur in association with site visits and to be&#13;
conducted by teams of financial analysts and engineers. Design review,&#13;
travel and subsistence costs will be funded by the project.&#13;
(b)   Supervision.  This is comprised of on-site inspection of water plant&#13;
construction and operation, latrine construction and health education&#13;
training programs. PPOs should plan to visit all project villages at least&#13;
once every year to review the status of project implementation, and CPOs&#13;
will need to make frequent village visits depending on each village's stage&#13;
of development. Where water plant size and complexity is beyond the&#13;
scope of the CPO's experience, provincial construction supervisors should&#13;
be engaged to perform that function. Supervision travel and subsistence&#13;
costs will be funded by the project.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting.  These activities include&#13;
conducting baseline surveys, monitoring performance indicators, and&#13;
preparing quarterly performance reports and biannual project financial&#13;
statements. Related travel and subsistence costs will be funded by the&#13;
project.&#13;
(d)   Development and Implementation of Baseline Surveys. The NPO will&#13;
oversee, and CPOs will conduct, baseline surveys in project villages, to&#13;
provide a basis for future monitoring and evaluation. The baseline survey&#13;
will cover five villages in each of the 40 project counties; in each village,&#13;
30 households will be surveyed. The survey will cover basic information&#13;
on population, gross income level and sources, coverage of different water&#13;
systems and latrine types, time and distance traveled to collect water, the&#13;
incidence of water-related diseases, health education activities and&#13;
coverage of villagers and school children, and percentage of rural residents&#13;
washing their hands before meals and after using the toilet, using soap,&#13;
and drinking boiled water. Resurveys will be conducted after the second&#13;
year of the project, or more frequently as needed.&#13;
Project Staffing Plans&#13;
31.   The NPO staff numbers 15 and is comprised of one director and one office&#13;
manager, two water supply engineers, four health education and sanitation specialists,&#13;
two accountants, two training coordinators, two procurement officers, and one translator.&#13;
Provincial and county project offices are similarly staffed, each having on average 12 to&#13;
15 employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
Financing Arrangements for Project Management Costs&#13;
32.   The project office budgets would include the costs of leasing office and storage&#13;
space (storage space may be constructed at the county level if suitable space is not&#13;
available for rent), supervision expenses, office staff training expenses, transportation to&#13;
project sites, and contracting for construction supervision or other outside services; office&#13;
staff salaries are not included in the budgets. The five-year NPO budget is Y 6.39 million&#13;
($719,000) and the combined province and county project office five-year budgets are&#13;
Y 12.0 million ($1.3 million). The IDA credit would be used to fund a portion of the&#13;
civil works costs, vehicles and office equipment, and technical assistance and training&#13;
costs. Transportation, travel expenses, and office operating expenses would be funded by&#13;
county governments. The NPO, PPO and CPO costs would be borne by county-level&#13;
counterpart funding annually in amounts proportional to each county's project investment&#13;
costs. It is the responsibility of the county government to repay any credit proceeds used&#13;
to finance project office assets. Some counties pass on all or part of these costs to&#13;
beneficiaries through the local water tariffs.&#13;

ANNEX 6: ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.    The provision of a safe and reliable water supply, improved environmental&#13;
sanitation facilities, and the health and sanitation education program are expected to&#13;
result in a marked improvement in environmental quality and the quality of life in&#13;
beneficiary villages. However modest, environmental risks are also faced in the project.&#13;
Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
2.    Several organizations share responsibility for recognizing and mitigating&#13;
environmental problems. The most important work is completed during the design stage.&#13;
Designers must recognize potential problems and design to avoid them. This includes&#13;
attention to the quality and nature of water sources, the engineering and construction&#13;
practices dictated in bidding documents, the provision for chlorination or other water&#13;
treatment, and, in health education, inclusion of the key health practices. The design&#13;
responsibilities vary by water supply system size and complexity, with county project&#13;
offices undertaking the easier work themselves and commissioning the more difficult.&#13;
Design review is provided by the provincial or national project offices for larger projects.&#13;
At each review stage, good environmental practice will be one evaluation criterion.&#13;
County construction quality assurance offices must certify that designs are adhered to for&#13;
projects valued at more than Y 0.5 million. Below that amount, CPOs provide that&#13;
service. Finally, for piped water systems, the county environmental protection bureau&#13;
must certify that the project complies with government regulations that require the&#13;
designs to contain appropriate environmental protection, and ensure that construction and&#13;
operations observe those regulations.  Thus, standard engineering reviews are&#13;
supplemented by professional environmental oversight for the systems most likely to&#13;
have environmental impacts.&#13;
Potential Impacts&#13;
3.    Potential environmental problems must be evaluated against the type of water&#13;
supply system anticipated. The bulk of the beneficiaries would use water from piped&#13;
systems supplied by wells. Wellheads are in small compounds, protected from surface&#13;
pollution. Simple chlorination systems are prAvided in case the regular water quality&#13;
testing shows problems with bacteria. If the latter occur, they are most likely to enter the&#13;
system from the pipe network, due to the intermittent operation that characterizes the&#13;
smallest systems. Villagers will be encouraged to continue boiling water as an additional&#13;
protection. Other piped systems use surface water supplies, which face a higher risk of&#13;
bacterial contamination. Many sources are springs, for which special source protection&#13;
measures, including villager education and physical protection from animal intrusion,&#13;
will be taken. In the few cases where river water supplies the plant, raw water quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                       ANNEX6&#13;
testing intervals will be shorter and continuous chlorination very likely. Such water&#13;
plants will have personnel trained in water quality testing, equipped with standard test&#13;
kits. These are employed successfully under RWSS.&#13;
4.    Where the improved water supply relies on hand pumps, wells are typically&#13;
scattered through the villages. Such wells are more vulnerable to contamination from&#13;
surface water, livestock, or latrines. Consequently, well aprons are designed to prevent&#13;
surface water contamination, wells are cased, and latrines and animal pens are separated&#13;
from the wells by minimum adequate distances. Well designs and setback distances are&#13;
specified by standard design manuals.&#13;
5.    A third type of water supply is rainwater collectors. These channel rainfall runoff,&#13;
generally from the roofs of houses, into holding tanks. To minimize pollution from&#13;
runoff, the systems are manually operated, with householders instructed to permit the first&#13;
flush to drain to the ground before directing further runoff into the holding tanks.&#13;
Householders are further trained to periodically add bleach to their tanks to minimize risk&#13;
from bacteria, and to continue boiling water. Tanks themselves are impermeable, with&#13;
the mouth elevated, covered when not in use, and surrounded by an apron to minimize&#13;
pollutant ingress at the extraction point. The county epidemic prevention station provides&#13;
semiannual water quality testing for these tanks.&#13;
6.    For any of the well systems, water quality can be a problem due to saline/alkaline&#13;
water intrusion into permeable aquifers or to high concentrations of fluorides, arsenic,&#13;
and other potentially toxic materials. These problems draw particular attention in this&#13;
project, for many of the investments would provide new water sources to escape precisely&#13;
those problems in current drinking water supplies. Water quality testing would be carried&#13;
out for all water sources, and where fluoride and arsenic are problems, that testing will&#13;
extend to careful assessment of the geology of the area, to identify sources unaffected by&#13;
toxins and unlikely to be affected by them through aquifer recharge. Periodic water&#13;
testing would then continue to look for evidence of these problems.&#13;
7.    Water extraction in the size plant envisioned here is too small to affect&#13;
groundwater resources other than in the immediate surrounds of the well, where the&#13;
pumping capacity may exceed the aquifer yield. That might result in damage to the&#13;
pump, but not to the environment. All new wells would be subject to standard yield tests,&#13;
the protocol for which was judged adequate by Association engineers. Similarly,&#13;
springfed and surface water supplies may not provide sustainable supplies through both&#13;
wet and dry seasons and in drought periods. However, these local sources are well&#13;
known, with the larger having documented flow histories often over hundreds of years.&#13;
Where needed, such as in one county where several plants will draw from the same river,&#13;
a formal hydraulic study would be made to assess the sustainability of the supply and&#13;
potential impact on downstream users. Where mitigating actions are necessary, they will&#13;
be taken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
Environmental Sanitation&#13;
8.    The project includes the provision of household and school composting latrines.&#13;
These latrines, designed to retain fecal material at a sufficiently high temperature for a&#13;
sufficiently long time to kill most pathogens, clearly improve on the current latrines.&#13;
They are sealed, hence prevent any passage of pathogens directly into the soil, and when&#13;
the compost is used on fields it does not threaten surface or groundwater supplies.&#13;
Furthermore, the latrines are designed to reduce insect access, virtually eliminating that&#13;
pathogen vector. For all these reasons, and the fact that construction of these latrines&#13;
should itself have no significant environmental impact, this component presents no&#13;
environmental risks.&#13;
Health and Sanitation Education&#13;
9.    The health and sanitation education component focuses on modifying behavior to&#13;
secure the safe use of water or otherwise improve hygiene. Any success in this effort will&#13;
lead to unambiguous environmental improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7: PROCUREMENT PACKAGING&#13;
Equipment and Materials&#13;
1.    With the exception of health education materials, all equipment and materials will&#13;
be procured either through annual ICB packages managed by the NPO or as part of the&#13;
appropriate civil works contract. The content of each annual ICB procurement will be&#13;
determined by the water system design work completed in each province. The provinces&#13;
consolidate the equipment and materials requirements and report them to the NPO prior&#13;
to July 15 each year, for the following year's needs. First-year design work, extrapolated&#13;
over the anticipated five-year construction program, yields an estimated ex-works or CIF&#13;
value of approximately $35.2 million for ICB procurement, with a total cost of&#13;
approximately $44 million. The NPO will consolidate provincial requests, packaging&#13;
equipment and materials in like groupings for procurement.  It will process the&#13;
procurement action in conjunction with the selected tendering company, the China&#13;
National Chemical Construction Company International Tendering Company&#13;
(CNCCCITC). All such procurements will be subject to Association prior review. A&#13;
step-by-step timeline for such a procurement action can be found in Attachment 1 to this&#13;
annex.&#13;
2.    The project would also need to produce health education materials, either as&#13;
printed material or as videocassettes. The content would be designed through the project,&#13;
with contracts awarded for production of the health education materials. The materials&#13;
will be varied in content and produced in quantities with estimated values below&#13;
$100,000 for each contract. For this reason, the materials would be procured through&#13;
several national shopping contracts over the five years, up to a maximum of $500,000.&#13;
Such contracts would be subject to Association postreview.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
3.    Civil works with an estimated total contract value of $77.4 million would be&#13;
constructed under the project. Because the largest systems would have total investments&#13;
below $1 million, with most systems below $200,000, procured over five years and 40&#13;
counties, all civil works would be contracted by National Competitive Bidding (NCB),&#13;
national shopping or force account. Contracts with estimated values above $400,000&#13;
would be contracted by the PPOs following the NCB procedures recently promulgated by&#13;
the government and reviewed and approved by the World Bank Group. Interested foreign&#13;
bidders would be allowed to bid for NCB contracts. For contracts with estimated values&#13;
below $400,000, project offices may use shopping as an alternative to NCB. In shopping,&#13;
the project office uses clear, uniform written specifications, including delivery terms and&#13;
conditions, to obtains bids from at least three qualified contractors from at least two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
counties. For contracts with estimated values at or above $100,000, the PPO conducts the&#13;
shopping. For contracts with estimated values below $100,000, the CPO may conduct&#13;
the procurement. Shopping can be used for contracts up to an aggregate value of $60&#13;
million. Included in this amount, force account may be used to procure civil works&#13;
valued at or below $20,000 in areas where there is no adequately qualified or interested&#13;
contractor. The aggregate value of force account procurement shall not exceed $10&#13;
million. A step-by-step timeline for typical civil works procurement actions with and&#13;
without Association prior review can be found in Attachment 2 to this annex.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
4.    An estimated $4.2 million will be devoted to technical assistance and training. A&#13;
total of about 9 person-months of foreign individual consultant assistance would be&#13;
needed for ICB bidding document preparation and preparation and analysis of the KAP&#13;
study. These consultants would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank Group's&#13;
"Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers,"&#13;
dated January 1997. Accordingly, the terms of reference and conditions of employment&#13;
for individual consultants would be subject to Association prior review. The borrower&#13;
intends to finance domestic individual consultants entirely through counterpart funds.&#13;
These consultants would therefore not be subject to Association prior review, although&#13;
Association supervision missions will assess whether such consultants are significantly&#13;
affecting project implementation.&#13;
5.    Project training plans include management and procurement training, water&#13;
supply and treatment financial and physical operations training, and sanitation and health&#13;
education training. The bulk of the training will be domestic, but up to five rounds of&#13;
overseas training would also be financed. All training will be financed on an incremental&#13;
cost basis, with the Association and project offices agreeing on unit training costs and the&#13;
portion of those costs considered incremental, as reflected in the minutes of negotiation.&#13;
Annual training plans will be an integral part of the annual work plan (AWP) submitted&#13;
for Association review and no-objection.&#13;
Surveys and Monitoring&#13;
6.    Survey and monitoring work would be financed by the project. The expenses are&#13;
primarily those connected with work in the villages-travel to and from villages, lodging,&#13;
food, and salaries. As with training, the baseline and follow-up studies and the KAP&#13;
study have defined total and incremental costs, with incremental costs eligible for&#13;
financing from the credit.&#13;

ANNEX 8: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
1.    Project implementation involves repeated iterations of village consultations,&#13;
design, tendering, construction, and operations process for the over 12,000 planned water&#13;
systems. The process is constrained at two points: first, to have determined equipment&#13;
and materials procurement requirements for a new plant by July 15 of each year, for&#13;
incorporation in the annual nationally-led ICB. Second, to have completed final designs&#13;
and civil works contracting for the plant in order to undertake construction during the 8-&#13;
month period from March to November that characterizes most project counties. A&#13;
typical water system would therefore follow this schedule:&#13;
YEAR                                   1998                    1999&#13;

Trial operation&#13;
Full operation&#13;
2.    Given the limited design and management resources, in most counties feasibility&#13;
studies and final design work will continue throughout the year, against the deadline&#13;
imposed by the equipment procurement. Missing the equipment procurement deadline&#13;
would force a one-year delay in the project, except for simple works that could be&#13;
procured wholly through a civil works contract.&#13;
3.    Annex 5, Schedule of Disbursements, reflects the intensity of the water supply&#13;
component investment over the project period. On an annual basis, the percentage of the&#13;
total water supply program expected to be completed is: 1998, 15; 1999, 20; 2000, 25;&#13;
2001, 25; and 2002, 15.&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
4.    The sanitation component standard designs are all well-tested and need no formal&#13;
adaptation for use in the villages. All procurement will be local and most work&#13;
completed within a week under force account. The only constraint is that the ground not&#13;
be frozen, so construction will occur during the same seasons as water supply. The&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                    ANNEX8&#13;
sanitation program will proceed in tandem with water supply, hence follow the pattern&#13;
given in para. 3, above.&#13;
Health Education&#13;
5.    The health education work will commence with a KAP study, scheduled to be&#13;
completed in early 1998. Based on that study, a training program will be devised and&#13;
submitted for Association review. Training of trainers is expected to start in summer,&#13;
1998, and village-level work shortly thereafter. The village work will be linked with the&#13;
water investments (village health education will likely begin at the water system&#13;
feasibility study stage and continue through the construction and implementation&#13;
periods). Therefore, this work, too, will follow the overall pattern of water supply&#13;
investment.&#13;

ANNEX 9: MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of solving the water supply&#13;
problems and improving sanitary use of that water for people in 40 poor counties will be&#13;
measured by reference to a number of monitoring indicators. The proposed specific project&#13;
objectives and the associated monitoring indicators are listed below. The monitoring&#13;
indicators study, to be conducted and completed by August 31, 1997, would identify&#13;
additional health behaviors, perhaps more significant than those listed below. If so, those&#13;
would be substituted for the proposed indicators.&#13;
Objective        Monitoring Indicator&#13;
Water Supply     *  Number of persons newly served with safe water;&#13;
1998: 0.4 million&#13;
1999: 1.5 million&#13;
2000: 3.0 million&#13;
2001: 4.0 million&#13;
2002: 4.6 million&#13;
Sustainability of supply: 95% of water systems meeting the tariff&#13;
covenant by the second full fiscal year of operation&#13;
Sanitation       *  Demonstration effect&#13;
The demonstration effect of project-financed sanitary latrines&#13;
would be shown by villagers using their own resources to&#13;
construct additional sanitary latrines. The number of such&#13;
latrines would measure the demonstration effect. Aggregated&#13;
at the county level, if the voluntary sanitary latrines equaled&#13;
or exceeded the project-financed latrines in number, a strong&#13;
effect would have been shown.&#13;
Health Education   *  Behavioral change&#13;
Within a year of health education program commencement in a&#13;
village, an average 5 percentage point improvement in the key&#13;
water-related behavior of washing hands before food prepara-&#13;
tion or eating, compared to the baseline period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                     ANNEX9&#13;
2.    Establishment of Baseline Conditions. Sanitation and health education indicators&#13;
will require a baseline level against which to measure project effectiveness. The baseline&#13;
data will be collected in baseline surveys and the KAP study, scheduled for completion by&#13;
November 30, 1997 and March 31, 1998, respectively.&#13;
3.    Additional Monitoring. Supervision missions will consider a broader set of&#13;
indicators than those for project impact monitoring, including:&#13;
(a)   Project Management:&#13;
(i)   the quality of mandatory review by the PPOs and NPO&#13;
(ii)   PPO and NPO supervision intensity&#13;
(iii)   adequacy of project office financing&#13;
(b)   Training:&#13;
(i)   frequency and coverage of training courses&#13;
(ii)   follow-up to training activities&#13;
(c)   Environmental Protection:&#13;
(i)   protection of project water sources&#13;
(ii)   compliance with environmental protection  measures during&#13;
construction&#13;
(d)   Resettlement: compliance with the Resettlement Policy Framework.&#13;
Evaluation of project performance against these indicators will play an important role in&#13;
the regular, and especially mid-term, evaluation of project performance.&#13;

-92 -                      ANNEX 11&#13;
ANNEX 11: LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
1.    All investment components-water supply, whether household, village system, or&#13;
larger, and latrines, be they household or school-will require land. Household-specific&#13;
investments, such as hand pumps or household latrines, require no special action for land&#13;
acquisition and are not covered by Chinese law or Bank Group policy. Nor are school&#13;
latrines, when the land used is on the school grounds. The only investments that may&#13;
invoke Chinese law or Bank Group policy are village-specific or multivillage water&#13;
supply schemes. Based on first-year designs, single-village schemes would comprise&#13;
about half of all water supply systems financed. In China, villagers collectively own the&#13;
land in their village. The villagers then assign themselves rights of varying duration for&#13;
the use of the land, with periodic reallocation of those rights. The State does not involve&#13;
itself in the rights allocation, except where concern about the conversion of cultivated&#13;
land to nonagricultural activities has led the State to require registration of such&#13;
conversion and, in some cases, payment of fees.&#13;
2.    When piped water supply systems supply more than one village, the water plant&#13;
requires the collective land of one of the villages. In these cases, the land would be&#13;
acquired by the county or township authorities under eminent domain, and both Chinese&#13;
law and Bank Group policy would apply. Typical taking for each treatment plant would&#13;
be no larger than 4-8 mu (4/15 to 8/15 hectares). To ensure that land acquisition is&#13;
minimized, the Resettlement Policy Framework (para. 3.22) stipulates that where planned&#13;
or actual land acquisition exceeds 3 mu (1/5 of a hectare) for any water supply scheme,&#13;
the county will be required to obtain PPO no-objection in addition to any local clearances&#13;
needed. Where planned or actual land acquisition exceeds 5 mu (1/3 of a hectare) for any&#13;
investment, or where residential buildings will be acquired, the county will be required to&#13;
obtain NPO no-objection in addition to any local clearances needed. Considerable&#13;
flexibility usually exists in water plant siting, so that housing or other buildings need&#13;
rarely, if ever, be acquired. On the other hand, acquisition of cultivated land may be&#13;
difficult to avoid. Where that happens, the current users will be compensated in a fashion&#13;
that maintains or improves their standard of living.&#13;
3.   Information on land required for each piped water supply system would be known&#13;
only on a year-to-year basis, as feasibility studies for the upcoming years' investments are&#13;
completed. The land required for the first year is 11.7 ha in 131 separate schemes, with&#13;
an average acquisition of 0.09 ha (see Attachment 1). Most of this land was previously in&#13;
field crops. The total amount of land which would be acquired for all schemes over the&#13;
five-year period is estimated at less than 120 ha. This land would be acquired in nearly&#13;
1,500 different sites over the 40 counties, or an average of about 0.08 ha per scheme.&#13;
Reflecting the modest impact in any affected village (typically no more than two&#13;
households affected), and the expectation that actual impacts will be known only on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                    ANNEX 11&#13;
year-to-year basis, the Bank Group did not seek an overall Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) for the project. Rather, a Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons (Attachment 2) was agreed with the&#13;
government during negotiations. The Framework requires each CPO to prepare an&#13;
annual Resettlement Inventory if fewer than 150 people are affected and otherwise to&#13;
prepare a RAP. Each annual Inventory or RAP will be reviewed by the respective PPO&#13;
and the NPO for conformity with the Framework, and submitted to IDA as part of the&#13;
AWP.&#13;

ATTACHMENT 2: POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR COMPENSATION, RESETTLEMENT AND&#13;
REHABILITATION OF PROJECT-AFFECTED PERSONS&#13;
SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. The Project&#13;
1.   The China National Rural Water Supply Project includes the provision of rural&#13;
water supply, health education and sanitation to five provinces and 40 counties. Land&#13;
acquisition relates to the land needed for water treatment plants in the water supply&#13;
component. Most of this land is small in size (less than 4 mu, or 4/15 hectare, per water&#13;
supply scheme) and is located within the village or nearby farm or vacant land. In most&#13;
of the schemes, the land is taken by the village for use in its own water supply scheme.&#13;
In some of the counties, the water supply scheme crosses village administrative&#13;
boundaries and the land is acquired through the local Land Administration Bureau.&#13;
B. Policy Framework&#13;
2.    Every effort will be made to minimize land acquisition and resettlement for land&#13;
acquired for water plants or any related structures.  In exceptional circumstances,&#13;
acquisition of additional land, houses and other assets, and the resettlement of people&#13;
losing the totality of their land and/or houses or a significant part thereof, may be&#13;
unavoidable. However, the number of people and magnitude of adverse effects would&#13;
only be known once the final alignment of the schemes is finalized during the detailed&#13;
design stage of the project.&#13;
3.    The principle objective of the Policy Framework is to ensure that all project-&#13;
affected persons (PAPs) will be compensated for their losses and provided with&#13;
rehabilitation measures to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their preproject&#13;
living standards and income earning capacity.&#13;
4.    The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria&#13;
of PAPs, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation, people's participation features and grievances procedures that will guide&#13;
the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs.&#13;
5.    Two types of documents will be required, depending on the number of PAPs for a&#13;
given county. If less than 150 PAPs are affected by the sum of water supply schemes in&#13;
the AWP of an individual county, the County Project Office will need to prepare an&#13;
Inventory (see below). If more than 150 PAPs are affected, a Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) will be required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                       ANNEX 11&#13;
C. Project Affected People (PAPs)&#13;
6.    The PAPs include the following persons to be identified for each of the&#13;
Inventories and Resettlement Action Plans as specified in Sections F and G and Section 5&#13;
of this Policy Framework:&#13;
(a)    Persons whose residence, place of business and/or agricultural land is in&#13;
part or in toto affected (permanently or temporarily) by the project;&#13;
(b)    Persons whose houses are in part or in toto affected by the project;&#13;
(c)    Persons whose businesses or agricultural livelihood are affected in part or&#13;
in toto (temporarily or permanently) by the Project; and&#13;
(d)    Persons whose crops and trees (annual and perennial) are affected in part&#13;
or in toto by the Project.&#13;
D. Principles and Objectives&#13;
7.    The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have&#13;
been adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard, the following principles&#13;
and objectives would be applied:&#13;
(a)    Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people, will be&#13;
minimized as much as possible.&#13;
(b)    All PAPs residing, working, doing business or cultivating land required&#13;
for the project as of the date of the baseline surveys (see Section 5) are&#13;
entitled to be provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist&#13;
them to improve or at least maintain their preproject living standards,&#13;
income-earning capacity and production levels. Lack of legal rights to the&#13;
assets lost will not bar the PAP from entitlement to such rehabilitation&#13;
measures.&#13;
(c)    The rehabilitation measures to be provided are:  (i) compensation at&#13;
replacement cost for houses and other structures; (ii) agricultural land for&#13;
land of equal productive capacity acceptable to the PAP or compensation&#13;
for land acquisition and resettlement subsidy for the farmers affected by&#13;
land acquisition; (iii) replacement of residence or place of business of&#13;
equal size acceptable to the PAP; and (iv) transfer and subsistence&#13;
allowances.&#13;
(d)    Replacement houseplots, place of business and agricultural land will be as&#13;
close as possible to the land that was lost, acceptable to the PAP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                    ANNEX 11&#13;
(e)   The resettlement transition period will be minimized and the rehabilitation&#13;
means will be provided to the PAPs prior to the expected startup date of&#13;
works in the respective project site.&#13;
(f)   PAPs will not be relocated until the Inventories or RAPs have been&#13;
completed and approved by the respective authority.&#13;
(g)   Plans for acquisition of land and other assets and provision of&#13;
rehabilitation measures will be carried out in consultation with the PAPs.&#13;
(h)   The previous level of community services and resources will be&#13;
maintained or improved.&#13;
(i)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be&#13;
made available as and when required.&#13;
(j)   Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design,&#13;
planning, consultation and implementation of the Inventories and RAPs.&#13;
(k)   Effective and timely supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the&#13;
implementation of the Inventories and RAPs will be carried out.&#13;
(1)   To ensure that land acquisition is minimized, where planned or actual land&#13;
acquisition exceeds 3 mu (1/5 of a hectare) for any water supply scheme,&#13;
the county will be required to obtain provincial no-objection in addition to&#13;
any local clearances needed. Where planned or actual land acquisition&#13;
exceeds 5 mu (1/3 of a hectare) for any water supply scheme, or where&#13;
residential buildings will be acquired, the county will be required to obtain&#13;
an NPO no-objection in addition to any local clearances needed.&#13;
E. AWPs and Reporting&#13;
8.    The individual Inventories and RAPs for each project province will be provided as&#13;
an annex to the province's AWP, and a summary will be provided in the AWP, to be&#13;
furnished to the NPO. The NPO will include the annex and summary in its project AWP,&#13;
to be submitted to IDA prior to the beginning of works for each year.&#13;
9.    The summary will include the following information:&#13;
(a)   Number of water supply schemes by county/province that will require an&#13;
Inventory or RAP&#13;
(b)   Total number of PAPs per county/province&#13;
(c)   Total amount of agricultural land to be acquired&#13;
(d)   Total amount of residential/commercial land to be acquired&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                    ANNEX 11&#13;
(e)   Total number of private structures to be acquired&#13;
(f)   Total number of public structures to be acquired&#13;
(g)   Total amount of funds required for compensations and/or resettlement&#13;
subsidies&#13;
F. Inventories&#13;
10.  In case less than 150 people are affected by the sum of the water supply schemes&#13;
in any AWP in an individual county, an Inventory for each scheme will be prepared by&#13;
the respective County Project Office (CPO).&#13;
11.   Each Inventory will be prepared in accordance with the guidelines provided below&#13;
and will include: (a) the baseline information as described in Section 5 of this Policy&#13;
Framework; (b) detailed compensation and other rehabilitation entitlements for PAPs;&#13;
(c) location, area and category of the replacement residential, business and agricultural&#13;
land to be provided, if that be the case; (d) a time-bound action plan for implementation;&#13;
and (e) a detailed budget and source of funding for the various compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation measures.&#13;
12.   Each Inventory will be furnished to the PPO and NPO for review prior to the&#13;
submission to IDA as part of the AWP. IDA would approve the inventories as part of the&#13;
approval of the project AWP for the following year. Compensation, resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation activities will only commence after the PPO has found acceptable the&#13;
respective Inventory and the NPO and IDA have approved it. The compensation,&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be completed before the beginning of works.&#13;
G. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)&#13;
13.  In case more than 150 people are affected by the sum of the water supply schemes&#13;
in any AWP in an individual county, a Resettlement Action Plan for each such scheme&#13;
will be prepared by the respective CPO in accordance with the provisions of this Policy&#13;
Framework. The RAP will be furnished by the CPO to the PPO and the NPO for review&#13;
prior to its submission to IDA as part of the AWP.&#13;
14.   Each RAP, in addition to the information to be provided under an Inventory, will&#13;
include: (a) a detailed socioeconomic survey of PAPs in accordance with Section 5&#13;
herein; and (b) arrangements for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
15.   Each RAP will be furnished to IDA as part of the project AWP for the following&#13;
year. Compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will only commence after&#13;
IDA has found acceptable the respective RAP and the NPO has approved it. The&#13;
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be completed before the&#13;
beginning of works for each scheme.&#13;
&#13;

SECTION 2: INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
A. Institutional Framework&#13;
16.   The responsibility for implementing the Policy Framework, Inventories and RAPs&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
(a)   The overall responsibility for enforcement of the Policy Framework and&#13;
for planning and implementing the Inventories and RAPs rests with the&#13;
NPO. In coordination with the respective county governments, each CPO&#13;
is responsible for preparing Inventories and RAPs and for the day-to-day&#13;
implementation thereof within their respective jurisdiction. The PPO will&#13;
ensure the active and effective participation of the PAPs in the preparation&#13;
and implementation of the Inventories and RAPs.&#13;
(b)   Funds for implementing the Inventories and RAPs will be incorporated&#13;
into the project budgets and will be provided by the respective local&#13;
governments in consultation with the PAPs and affected villages.&#13;
B. Legal Framework&#13;
17.   The following laws and regulations, in addition to the Bank's Operational&#13;
Directive 4.30, constitute the legal framework governing the implementation of this&#13;
Policy Framework and the Inventories and RAPs: At the national level, the State Land&#13;
Law (passed by the sixteenth session of the Sixth National Congress in June 1986, and&#13;
revised by the fifth session of the Seventh National Congress in December 1988); and the&#13;
Implementation Regulations of Land Law. At the provincial level:&#13;
*  "Land Management Laws and Regulations" (Yunnan Province Land&#13;
Administration Bureau, 1993)&#13;
*  "Hubei Province Land Management Implementation Strategies" (Twenty-&#13;

SECTION 3: ENTITLEMENT POLICY&#13;
18.   PAPs will be entitled to the following types of compensation and rehabilitation&#13;
measures:&#13;
(a)    PAPs losing agricultural land&#13;
(i)    For the majority of schemes, the land will be reallocated within the&#13;
village by the village authorities. Where there is a gap between the&#13;
loss of land and the reallocation within the village, the PAP will be&#13;
provided with a transition compensation sufficient to ensure that&#13;
their living standard is restored.  In situations where land&#13;
reallocation is not possible, the PAP will be paid compensation and&#13;
a resettlement subsidy sufficient to at least restore their living&#13;
standard.&#13;
(ii)    For schemes where  the  land  is acquired  by  the  Land&#13;
Administration Bureau, the general mechanism for compensation&#13;
of lost agricultural land will be through provision of payment of&#13;
land compensation and resettlement subsidy sufficient to restore&#13;
their living standard.&#13;
(iii)    These amounts will be paid to the village/PAPs whose land is&#13;
affected and may be used for, among other things: (1) increasing&#13;
land areas under cultivation if land is available; (2) intensification&#13;
of agriculture through provision of irrigation, improved&#13;
agricultural practices, etc.; (3) development of nonagriculture-&#13;
based income-generation activities. PAPs will be compensated for&#13;
the loss of standing crops and fruit or trees used for industrial&#13;
purposes at market price.&#13;
(iv)    PAPs whose land is temporarily taken by the works under the&#13;
Project will be compensated for their loss of income, standing&#13;
crops and for the cost of soil restoration and permanently damaged&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
(b)   PAPs losing residential land and structures&#13;
(i)    The mechanism for compensating loss of residential land and&#13;
structures will be: (1) the provision of replacement residential land&#13;
(house site and courtyard) of equivalent size, satisfactory to the&#13;
PAP; and (2) cash compensation reflecting full replacement cost of&#13;
the structures, without depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                       ANNEX 11&#13;
(ii)   If a partially affected structure is no longer viable, the entire&#13;
structure will be acquired and full replacement cost, without&#13;
depreciation, paid.&#13;
(c)   PAPs losing business&#13;
(i)    The mechanism for compensating loss of business will be: (1) the&#13;
provision of alternative business site of equal size and accessibility&#13;
to customers, satisfactory to the PAP; (2) cash compensation to the&#13;
owner for lost business structure reflecting full replacement cost of&#13;
the structures, without depreciation and the cost of transfer; and&#13;
(3) cash compensation for the loss of income during the transition&#13;
period.&#13;
19.   PAPs will also be provided compensation at full replacement cost, without&#13;
depreciation for any other fixed assets affected in part or in toto by the project, such as&#13;
tombs and water wells.&#13;
20.   In cases where community infrastructure such as schools, factories, water sources,&#13;
roads, sewage systems or electrical supply is damaged, the CPO will ensure that these&#13;
would be restored or repaired as the case may be, at no cost to the community.&#13;
SECTION 4: PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION&#13;
21.   The PAPs will participate throughout the various stages of the planning and&#13;
implementation of the Inventories and RAPs. For these purposes and prior to the&#13;
preparation of the Inventories and RAPs, the PAPs will be informed of the provisions of&#13;
this Policy Framework at public meetings held by the respective CPO, township and&#13;
village agencies.&#13;
22.   Each household PAP will be fully informed by the relevant township and village&#13;
governments of their entitlements and rehabilitation choices under the respective&#13;
Inventory or RAP.&#13;
SECTION 5: BASELINE INFORMATION&#13;
A. Inventories&#13;
23.   The baseline information for the Inventory for each water supply scheme will&#13;
include for each affected village/PAP:&#13;
(a)   number of persons and main occupation and level of income;&#13;
(b)   number, type, and area of the houses lost;&#13;
(c)   number and area of all the residential plots lost;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

socioeconomic survey of all PAPs describing their occupation, sources of income,&#13;
educational level and opportunities for income restoration.&#13;
SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Implementation Schedule&#13;
25.   A detailed implementation schedule of the various activities to be undertaken will&#13;
be included in each Inventory and RAP.&#13;
26.   Payment of compensation and furnishing of other rehabilitation entitlements (in&#13;
cash or in-kind), and relocation if that be the case, will be completed prior to the&#13;
scheduled startup date of works in the respective project site.&#13;
B. Complaints and Grievances&#13;
27.   Complaints and grievances related to any aspect of the Inventories and RAPs,&#13;
including the determined area and price of the lost assets, will be handled as follows:&#13;
(a)   As a first stage, PAPs will present their complaints and grievances to the&#13;
CPO authorities. If the PAP is not satisfied with the decision of the CPO&#13;
authority, the PAP may present the case to the PPO. If the PAP is not&#13;
satisfied with the decision of the PPO authorities, the PAP may present the&#13;
case to the NPO.&#13;
(b)   If the PAP is not satisfied with the decision of the NPO, the case may be&#13;
submitted for consideration by the People's Court.&#13;
(c)   The mechanism for complaints and grievances should be made known to&#13;
all PAPs prior to the preparation of the Inventory or RAP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                     ANNEX 11&#13;
C. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
28.  Implementation of the Inventories and RAPs will be regularly supervised and&#13;
monitored by the respective PPO in coordination with the respective county government.&#13;
The findings will be recorded in semi-annual reports to be furnished to the NPO.&#13;
29.   Monitoring and supervision will:&#13;
(a)   Verify that the baseline information of all PAPs has been obtained and that&#13;
the valuation of assets lost or damaged, and the provision of&#13;
compensation, resettlement and other rehabilitation entitlements has been&#13;
carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Policy Framework&#13;
and the respective Inventory and RAP.&#13;
(b)   Oversee that the Inventories and RAPs are implemented as designed and&#13;
approved.&#13;
(c)   Verify that funds for implementing the Inventories and RAPs are provided&#13;
in a timely manner and in amounts sufficient for their purposes, and that&#13;
such funds are used by the township or village government in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of the Inventory or RAP.&#13;
SECTION 7: COSTS AND BUDGET&#13;
30.   Each Inventory and RAP will include detailed cost of compensation and other&#13;
rehabilitation entitlements and relocation of PAPs, if that be the case, with a breakdown&#13;
by agricultural land, residential land, business land, houses, businesses and other assets.&#13;
The cost estimates will make adequate provision for contingencies.&#13;

ANNEX 13: ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
1.    The most recent CAS, presented to the Board in March 1997, stresses the&#13;
centrality of poverty alleviation to the Bank lending program. A related goal is the&#13;
direction of resources to the inland provinces. The proposed project responds directly to&#13;
both of those concerns by supporting the national and local efforts to expand safe water,&#13;
village sanitation and health education in five inland provinces. The IDA credit provides&#13;
financing of sufficient size, matched to the longevity of the asset, to allow poor villagers&#13;
access to safe water.&#13;
2.    The provision of village water supplies has long been either a private or village&#13;
collective responsibility in China. The state has played a very minor role in financing,&#13;
constructing, or managing such supplies. In the period 1991-95, of the estimated total&#13;
investment of Y 15.3 billion in rural water supply, only 24 percent came from township&#13;
or higher government sources. Another 7 percent came from external financing, but&#13;
villagers or their collectives provided 69 percent of the capital needed to construct&#13;
improved water systems. This financing strategy has had the very positive consequence&#13;
of strong villager commitment to maintaining systems once built. Effective collective&#13;
organization at the village level has also facilitated water system construction where&#13;
physical and economic conditions were ripe.&#13;
3.    As noted in the previous paragraph, external resources covered 7 percent of&#13;
investment costs during 1991-95.  Technical assistance and modest investment&#13;
contributions have come through the United Nations system, particularly UNICEF and&#13;
UNDP. The latter have financed research and pilot project work in both water supply and&#13;
sanitation, with a focus on hand pumps for water supply. Bilateral agencies have&#13;
supported small-scale water supply work through grant and loan programs, such as the&#13;
British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) grant studying township and&#13;
village enterprise pollution of water sources. The village programs of some international&#13;
nongovernmental organizations have also included sanitation and water supply. Finally,&#13;
the Association has already financed two related projects, with the equivalent of about&#13;
$190 million forming a substantial proportion of the external financing in the five-year&#13;
period.&#13;
4.    Despite those investments, in 1993 (the year of the last national survey of this&#13;
issue), only 57 percent of rural Chinese had access to safe water. Using the construction&#13;
of piped water systems as a proxy for the spread of safe water since that time, coverage&#13;
by the end of 1995 may have been on the order of 60 percent. Although the national&#13;
survey did not relate coverage to village income, fieldwork shows that poor villages are&#13;
notably less likely to enjoy safe water supply than are wealthier villages. This result is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
unremarkable in itself, but given the abundant evidence of sufficient village willingness-&#13;
to-pay (WTP) for improved water in many poor villages, it does reveal a role for&#13;
Association financing.&#13;
5.    The environment is one of substantial revealed demand for a good that has&#13;
significant positive externalities in terms of health status and national poverty alleviation&#13;
goals. However, the poor population demanding the good lacks access to suitable&#13;
financing instruments. In this environment, the provision of public financing meets a&#13;
social goal unmet by the market. IDA funds are therefore appropriately used in this&#13;
project and are particularly appropriate because the loan duration matches the asset life of&#13;
the investment. The one misfit between IDA funds and beneficiary needs arises in the&#13;
fact that project income streams are in local currency and beneficiary villages have no&#13;
effective means of hedging the resulting foreign exchange risk. The ideal onlending&#13;
instrument would be denominated in local currency.&#13;
6.    The Chinese financial system itself provides no local currency instrument that&#13;
could be effectively used for the rural water investments. Commercial local currency&#13;
loans have a much shorter duration than IDA and are unavailable to local governments&#13;
under Chinese law. In theory, a village could form a water company eligible for&#13;
commercial loans, but such a company based in a poor village would face competing&#13;
borrowers with investments offering much higher financial rates of return.&#13;
7.    Province and County Choices. Chapter 2 and Annex 1 describe the provinces and&#13;
counties chosen for project participation. Project provinces were identified by NPHCC,&#13;
SPC, and MOF, guided by the CAS goal of choosing inland provinces and the need to&#13;
choose provinces with relatively large unserved rural populations. Given that both wealthy&#13;
and poor counties can be found in all project provinces, the choice of county outweighs that&#13;
of province in targeting assistance on poor people. Participating counties were selected&#13;
according to their: (a) rural poverty, in which the poorest counties were given first rights&#13;
of participation; (b) percentage of rural people lacking access to improved water supplies;&#13;
(c) number of people exposed to unsafe water, as evidenced by fluoride or alkali content,&#13;
or by the incidence of gastrointestinal illness; (d) existing provincial plans targeting&#13;
priority areas of rural water improvement; (e) demonstrated ability to provide the needed&#13;
counterpart funds; and (f) willingness to form and staff a county project office to agreed&#13;
standards. All participating counties are either among the nationally- or provincially-&#13;
designated poor counties, or, in the one exception, have particularly severe health&#13;
problems resulting from poor water quality. The selection mechanism represents a&#13;
compromise between the goal of serving the poorest and the necessity of investing in areas&#13;
where beneficiaries can meet their share of initial investment costs, as well as afford the&#13;
financial costs of systems operation and loan repayment. This compromise has the effect of&#13;
selecting those poor counties and villages with incomes well below the Y 3,050 average&#13;
annual income of the international standard purchasing power parity poverty line of $1 per&#13;
capita per day, but near the 1995 Chinese poverty line of Y 530 per year. Counties and&#13;
villages in even deeper poverty, yet needing substantial investments to assure safe water&#13;
supplies, need to be aided by a mechanism more leavened with grant aid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                       ANNEX 13&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
8.    The project will benefit an estimated 4.6 million rural people in 40 poor counties.&#13;
Ideally, participating villages would have been chosen by evaluating net present value&#13;
(NPV) generated by water investments, including public health, social welfare, or other&#13;
externalities, and choosing that set of investments that maximized the surplus value across&#13;
all villages. However, generating such information over the nearly 1,500 piped water and&#13;
thousands of nonpiped systems proposed would be excessively costly, if even possible to an&#13;
acceptable level of uncertainty. As an alternative, villages are required to past a test of&#13;
revealed demand-a willingness to supply capital and levy water tariffs that cover the full&#13;
operating costs of and loans incurred by the system. Thus, the water investments are&#13;
justified in terms of private demand. A very wide array of villages would meet such a test,&#13;
including those that are relatively well off, yet still unserved by safe water. In practice,&#13;
counties select villages based on an initial assessment of the cost of supplying water and&#13;
whether the likely village demand would meet those costs. If they feel a particular village&#13;
might be eligible to participate, they offer the opportunity and the village makes its own&#13;
assessment of services, costs, and willingness to pay. When a village elects to participate,&#13;
a feasibility study is done that more carefully fixes service levels and costs, and villagers&#13;
have a second opportunity to opt out of, or attempt to modify the terms of, participation.&#13;
The village selection technique biases selection toward better-off villages in the county.&#13;
However, given that the highest income villages already have met their safe water needs&#13;
(on average, 22 percent of the villages already have such service), and that the credit will&#13;
provide an additional 40 to 60 percent additional coverage, the benefiting villages will be&#13;
widely grouped around the county mean income level.&#13;
9.    The actual NPV of the investment will vary from system to system, depending on&#13;
actual villager WTP, public health and social welfare externalities, and system economic&#13;
costs. In none of the villages visited was water marketed by private vendors, nor was such&#13;
marketing reported for other villages. This comparator for direct valuation of water is&#13;
therefore unavailable. In the absence of such a market, the use of a financial covenant for&#13;
the water supply investment does set a base economic rate of return (ERR). The covenant&#13;
(para. 5.9) requires that tariffs cover all operations and maintenance costs and the greater of&#13;
depreciation or debt service. Chinese regulations require a depreciation rate of 3.5 percent.&#13;
The onlending rate, as noted in para. 3.11, is 3 percent, with a 17-year maturity, so debt&#13;
service will exceed depreciation for those years. Given that the standard conversion factor&#13;
for China is 1.0, major equipment and materials inputs are acquired through ICB, and no&#13;
major domestic input has an economic price above its financial price, a simple calculation&#13;
shows that if the covenant is met, the lower-bound ERR will be at least 3 percent. The&#13;
actual rate will be higher in all cases as the calculation does not incorporate consumer&#13;
surplus, nor does it reflect the fact that the actual tariff will be set on a cost structure that&#13;
includes the VAT and other taxes and duties, as well as incorporating a return to&#13;
government capital contributions in many counties. The government choice to direct scarce&#13;
international resources to these villages gives evidence of significant positive public health&#13;
or social welfare externalties additional to the private value of increased water supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
10.   The covenanted tariffs yield positive lower-bound ERRs, but do not match the&#13;
established discount rate of 12 percent for Bank Group projects in China. The relative&#13;
contribution of consumer surplus therefore becomes a key issue for economic evaluation.&#13;
The demand curve for the improved supply depends very much on the original supply,&#13;
which typically remains available. In almost all cases, some substitution of sources is&#13;
possible. Even when the original source contains toxic levels of arsenic, as in some&#13;
villages in Nei Mongol, that water can still be used for washing. However, for human&#13;
and some animal consumption, no effective household treatment exists to remove arsenic,&#13;
fluoride, or salt, and for drinking and cooking, water from the new source will be highly&#13;
preferred to the old. For the more common bacterial and viral contamination, boiling for&#13;
sufficiently long periods can negate the problem and the trade-off between old supply and&#13;
new becomes one of the cost of fuel and time. These issues are stressed here because in&#13;
some very low-income villages under RWSS, demand for improved water has not met&#13;
expectations, with consequent reductions in economic returns.  Those cases are&#13;
characterized by convenient, if unsafe, existing supply. There, villagers have maintained&#13;
or even increased overall consumption of water, but used the high-quality source only for&#13;
drinking and cooking. In those cases, at water tariffs above Y 1.0/m3, the new source&#13;
may supply only 20 to 30 liters/capita/day (lcd) of a total consumption exceeding 60 lcd.&#13;
11.   The above discussion referred to substitution based on quality. A second source&#13;
of difference is water source location. Here, circumstances vary greatly across project&#13;
counties. In Hubei counties, for example, surface or shallow well-water sources tend to&#13;
be convenient for all households, with no more than a five-minute walk to a source in all&#13;
seasons of the year. There, the problems are mainly those of water quality. In other&#13;
project provinces, however, access to raw water, even with existing wells, can be highly&#13;
seasonal. During the rainy season, water, often of good quality, will be conveniently&#13;
located. But during the dry season, and particularly in drought years, 40 minute or longer&#13;
round trips for water are not uncommon. In these locations, then, the demand for&#13;
improved water varies with the season. Demand for improved supplies will be highly&#13;
inelastic during the dry season, but very elastic during the rainy season. Economic&#13;
returns to new supply likewise vary across seasons.&#13;
12.   The substitution possibilities lead to a uniformly inelastic demand for the first&#13;
20 lcd of safe water consumption, with demand for additional quantities varying with the&#13;
conditions cited above. Where alternative sources are readily available and per capita&#13;
incomes are below about Y 600, demand for improved sources remains inelastic due to&#13;
the low time value of using the alternatives. At higher income levels and where&#13;
alternative sources are less convenient, demand is more elastic.&#13;
13.   Because convenience-the time required to obtain water from a particular source&#13;
-is a major determinant of demand for improved supply, and because the impact on&#13;
private demand is much more readily analyzed than are other contributors to that demand,&#13;
this analysis will focus on the time variable. The methodology for calculating the cost of&#13;
time is well developed and that used here is based on the discussion in "The Value of&#13;
Time In Economic Evaluation of Transport Projects: Lessons from Recent Research"&#13;
(World Bank, Infrastructure Notes, OT-5, 1997). In this formulation, household income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109 -                     ANNEX 13&#13;
is used to calculate the value of time used in pursuits that do not yield monetary income.&#13;
For illustrative purposes, three Jiangxi province project counties are used to show the&#13;
implications of income levels for the cost of water collected from unimproved sources&#13;
(Table 1). The table has been constructed assuming very conservative values whenever a&#13;
choice needed to be made. For water gathering time, only 7.5 minutes per round trip is&#13;
assumed for surface sources. With household wells, that is reduced to 4 minutes per&#13;
round trip. Note that collection time from an improved yard tap will not differ much&#13;
from a household well, the difference coming in the time needed to lift out a pail of water&#13;
from a well, or pump out the same volume using a hand pump. One important factor not&#13;
reflected in the table is the effort connected with the time spent. Clearly, the effort of&#13;
filling a pail by turning a spigot is much less than lifting water from a well, even if the&#13;
time needed for both is approximately the same. Any adjustment to the cost for the effort&#13;
of gathering water from the unimproved source would serve to increase that cost.&#13;

14.   The conclusion from the table is straightforward: a family currently served by a&#13;
household well supplying water that will be safe after boiling will have little financial&#13;
incentive to use improved water supplies if time is the only factor. Even at the higher&#13;
income range (recalling that these families remain under the poverty line), household&#13;
wells supply water as cheaply as piped supply. Either source is likely to be boiled, given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-110 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
the Chinese preference for taking drinking water in the form of tea. However, the cost of&#13;
collecting water quickly exceeds the tariff for piped supply once the family must rely on&#13;
sources outside their own compound. Even with a round trip of 7.5 minutes, families at&#13;
the average income of the lowest income county are indifferent between purchased and&#13;
collected supply. For Shangyou and Xiajiang county income levels, improved supply&#13;
becomes a very attractive alternative to gathering water outside of the household&#13;
compound. Where raw water sources cannot be easily treated to yield drinking water,&#13;
families will readily carry drinking water over 20-minute round trips, indicating a value&#13;
for that water of at least Y 2.0/m3, even for the poorer families.&#13;
15.   The analysis accords well with observed behavior in RWSS. There, as related&#13;
above, use of improved supplies drops to about 20 lcd at prices above Y 1.0/m 3 for the&#13;
very poorest villages. However, the higher-income households among project villages&#13;
supply almost all of their demand from improved supply. This information allows us to&#13;
say something about the relative contribution of consumer surplus to the total private&#13;
value of improved supply, hence respond to the question of the size of the ERR and NPV.&#13;
First, recall that when villagers choose whether to participate in the project, they know&#13;
the approximate tariff levels. Villagers choosing to participate thus face costs for at least&#13;
part of their supply that are as great as the projected tariff. Projected tariffs for the bulk&#13;
of the villages in the first year (the only year for which projections have been done)&#13;
3&#13;
almost all fall in the range of Y 0.70 to Y 1.0/m , with a few systems facing fluoride or&#13;
distant safe sources running as high as Y 1.40. These tariffs often include recapture of&#13;
government capital contributions, hence yield ERRs above the 3 percent covenant level.&#13;
However, assuming the worst case, that the tariff represents only a 3 percent lower bound&#13;
for the ERR and that no real income increases are expected over the project life, the&#13;
consumer surplus would have to increase total value by 38 percent over that captured in&#13;
the tariff for the project to enjoy a positive NPV for the private demand (any positive&#13;
externalities to, say, public health, would further increase NPV). With a 3 percent per&#13;
year increase in real incomes (lower than the actual figure over the past five years), the&#13;
consumer surplus would have to increase total value by 25 percent to realize a positive&#13;
NPV. The consumer surplus will depend importantly on the assumed Y-axis intercept of&#13;
the demand curve and the shape of the curve. But for a tariff of Y 1.0 and a straight line&#13;
from the consumption point to the Y-axis, the intercept would need to be only Y 1.76 to&#13;
have positive private NPV with no income growth. With 3 percent income growth, a&#13;
Y 1.50 intercept would provide a positive net private NPV. Based on the water collection&#13;
time cost in the above table, the intercept can reasonably be expected to exceed Y 1.76&#13;
when either convenient supply cannot be treated or supply must be collected from a&#13;
distance exceeding a 20-minute round trip. For the higher-income poor counties, even a&#13;
7.5-minute round trip justifies the higher intercept. Those systems with higher tariffs also&#13;
have consumers facing privately untreatable quality problems or very distant safe sources.&#13;
In both of those cases, the private cost of alternatives is also very high, hence the demand&#13;
intercepts will themselves be higher.&#13;
16.   Sensitivity Analysis.  Given that nearly 1,500 piped systems would be&#13;
constructed under the project, a wide array of actual ERRs is anticipated. The economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 111 -                    ANNEX 13&#13;
test is to realize a positive NPV, not maximize that NPV over the project. As the time&#13;
value chart shows, maximizing private NPV would generally involve selecting higher-&#13;
income villages in preference to lower-income as project beneficiaries. This selection&#13;
bias against serving the poor occurs in any project in which time value plays a crucial role&#13;
in determining returns. Indeed, to overcome this problem in transport projects, the&#13;
"Infrastructure Note" cited above recommends using average national time values, rather&#13;
than location-specific values, to avoid biasing road investments toward wealthier areas.&#13;
That works as a political selection mechanism, but is not defensible in terms of ERR or&#13;
NPV calculations. In this project, the tariff provides a self-selection mechanism that&#13;
guards against projects with negative NPVs. As the time value calculations show,&#13;
economic returns from projects meeting the tariff covenant have a very high probability&#13;
of yielding a positive NPV. Indeed, where existing water sources are distant or&#13;
untreatable to safe standards, the ERR will be well above 12 percent and the NPV well&#13;
above zero.&#13;
17.   The argument in the foregoing paragraph relies on accurate forecasting of demand&#13;
at each village, so that the consumers use, and pay for, sufficient water to actually cover&#13;
the enumerated costs. Experience in the ongoing RWSS project makes it clear that&#13;
designers usually correctly estimate use rates. However, some counties have shown a&#13;
tendency to design for and construct excess supply, on the theory that economic growth,&#13;
hence incomes and commercial and industrial demand, will proceed at a rapid pace. This&#13;
issue therefore was the subject of considerable scrutiny during the appraisal process. The&#13;
appraisal mission deemed the best proxy for system demand to be demand for similar&#13;
systems in adjoining areas within a county. Where such evidence could not be found, or&#13;
comparable systems had markedly lower tariffs, CPOs have been asked to undertake&#13;
additional analysis to justify their choices.&#13;
Sanitation and Health Education&#13;
18.   The value of safe water supplies can be negated by a failure to follow good health&#13;
and sanitation practices. For example, food preparers who have not washed their hands&#13;
can easily contaminate the water after it leaves the tap. Unfortunately, while affordable&#13;
physical investments can solve many of the water quality problems, the behavioral&#13;
change needed for good health and sanitation practices is much harder to induce. For&#13;
decades, the Chinese National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (NPHCC) has run&#13;
health education and action campaigns targeting a broad array of rural health problems.&#13;
They achieved early successes that included reduction of schistosomiasis and insect-&#13;
borne diseases, both cases where disease vectors were easy for rural people to identify.&#13;
NPHCC has also worked on a number of important sanitation interventions, including&#13;
boiling water; latrine use, particularly composting latrines that promise high rates of&#13;
pathogen destruction; and hand washing. They report success in spreading knowledge of&#13;
good practice, and Bank preparation and supervision missions have rarely met an adult&#13;
who hadn't heard of the importance of boiling water. However, in many poor villages&#13;
those same adults report frequent consumption of unboiled water, especially in the&#13;
summer and by young children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112-                       ANNEX13&#13;
19.   Latrine use rates are high, at over 90 percent, reflecting an ancient concern with&#13;
capturing fecal material to fertilize crops. However, only 10 percent of rural households&#13;
have composting latrines and their coverage has grown very slowly. Not surprisingly,&#13;
Chinese surveys have consistently shown a high correlation between handling untreated&#13;
fecal material and intestinal and other illness. For the last three decades, government has&#13;
worked to identify treatment methods that substantially reduce pathogen transmission. A&#13;
number of latrine designs, when properly used, have been shown to massively reduce the&#13;
number of pathogens. However, compared to the simple traditional designs, such latrines&#13;
require purchased inputs and unfamiliar construction techniques. Cost, which can easily&#13;
amount to a year's per capita income in poor villages, and the lack of a proven health&#13;
benefit have slowed adoption.&#13;
20.   Unlike water supply under the RWSS project, the WTP for improved sanitation&#13;
under RWSS has been well below the private cost of latrine construction. Even in&#13;
villages with high subsidies for the construction of private composting latrines, uptake&#13;
rates have been low. This correlates with national and international experience with&#13;
improved sanitation-everywhere the private demand for sanitation substantially lags that&#13;
for improved water supply. Were this project to seek rapid advance in installing&#13;
improved latrines, project design would need to be bimodal, in the sense of working with&#13;
relatively wealthy counties on the sanitation issue, for that is where sanitation WTP will&#13;
be highest. However, experience under RWSS suggests that such an approach would&#13;
over stretch the administrative capacity of provincial project offices and the disconnect&#13;
between the water and sanitation issues would hinder overall implementation. Instead,&#13;
the project will have lower expectations of sanitation than of water supply, proceeding in&#13;
a cautious and experimental manner toward expanded use.&#13;
21.   In the context of preparing this project, a viable benefit estimation procedure for&#13;
the sanitation and health education components has not been identified.  The&#13;
methodology is certainly known, but involves sophisticated epidemiological work for&#13;
which the needed data are not at hand and for which the cost cannot be justified. In the&#13;
absence of such a test, the project seeks to lower the cost of improved sanitation through&#13;
the provision of technical assistance in design and to increase private demand through&#13;
demonstrating the technology to villagers. Even in the absence of an adequate rationale&#13;
for subsidizing private sanitation facilities, such a rationale does exist for improved&#13;
school latrines. School health education courses, which have demonstrated a substantial&#13;
positive impact on health, lose effectiveness if taught in an environment where students&#13;
cannot practice the skills they are being taught. Quite apart from the project concerns,&#13;
inadequate sanitary facilities are also known to discourage school attendance by girls of&#13;
some age groups or ethnicity.&#13;
22.   The project will begin to overcome, however modestly, the gap in NPHCC's&#13;
knowledge of the impact of their work. The baseline and KAP studies financed by the&#13;
project will, for the first time, permit direct and systematic estimation of project impacts.&#13;
The studies provide the basis for adapting program content to results over and past the&#13;
life of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113-                       ANNEX13&#13;
C. TYPICAL COSTS&#13;
23.   Water supply costs vary depending on the available sources of raw water, their&#13;
location relative to the served village(s), and treatment levels needed to assure safe&#13;
supply. Those costs are village-specific. But costs also vary with the choice of delivery&#13;
level (standpipes, household connections, continuous or intermittent supply). Those costs&#13;
are household-specific. Where villages elect to build systems allowing household&#13;
connections, households have the option of seeking household connections or not. Those&#13;
that elect such connections in the first year of project construction will have those costs&#13;
eligible for reimbursement under the credit. Households electing to connect in later years&#13;
will bear the full cost of such connections.&#13;
24.   The feasibility studies on first-year proposed systems yielded estimated operations&#13;
costs and projected tariffs. The system cost estimates for the first-year construction&#13;
program are based on accurate bills of quantity. The inputs are all locally available,&#13;
hence prices are reliably known. Furthernore, the projections can be validated against&#13;
costs experienced in the ongoing RWSS project. Based on the feasibility studies, the&#13;
project shows the following range of costs per cubic meter of delivered water:&#13;
Province          Nonpiped supply        Piped supply&#13;
(yiM3) /a            (Yim)&#13;
Yunnan                 0.75               0.55-1.00&#13;
Hebei                  N/A                0.45-1.45&#13;
Hlubei                 N/A                0.80-1.20&#13;
Nei Mongol              0.60              0.84-1.43&#13;
Jiangxi                 N/A               0.54-1.30&#13;
/a Nonpiped supply costs were estimated in yuan/family served&#13;
terms in the feasibility studies. To derive an estimate that could&#13;
be compared to the piped systems, water use of [30 liters/day/&#13;
capita] was assumed.&#13;
25.   These figures are comparable to those under RWSS. Urban residents typically&#13;
pay much less for a more reliable water supply, with rates ranging from about Y 0.4/m3 to&#13;
Y 0.8/m3. Lower urban prices have two main causes. First, their water pricing is based&#13;
on the depreciated, historical value of capital and many of the systems are at least a&#13;
decade old. Second, urban governments have traditionally subsidized many of the&#13;
investment costs, which were then not used in the price basis for the system.&#13;
D. POVERTY ANALYSIS&#13;
26.   The beneficiaries under the project are located within some of China's poorest&#13;
communities. Accordingly, offering low-cost water supply options and a means of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-114-                        ANNEX13&#13;
financing them through the water tariffs are key to the affordability of these systems.&#13;
Beyond this, communities selected for inclusion in the project must demonstrate the&#13;
willingness and ability to pay for safe and convenient water supplies by collecting&#13;
beneficiary investment contributions prior to commencement of construction. In the&#13;
selection of project counties, local per capita income information was analyzed. The&#13;
anticipated water tariffs were then compared against the average income figures, which&#13;
range from Y 400 to Y 1,430 per capita per year. In the highest case, annualized water fees&#13;
are expected to represent 4.2 percent of beneficiary income, and in most cases less than 3&#13;
percent. Asset holdings are unknown and the burden of making the capital contribution&#13;
difficult to analyze. Here, though, the willingness to contribute is immediately tested and&#13;
found to be high. In the ongoing RWSS project, beneficiaries have continually shown a&#13;
willingness to pay the cost of their water supply.&#13;
27.   Preliminary estimates suggest the following levels of tariff as a percentage of&#13;
villager income:&#13;
Province                       Estimated percentage of villager income needed&#13;
to purchase water at estimated use levels of the new system&#13;
(lowest and highest county)&#13;
Yunnan                                           2.0-4.2&#13;
Hebei                                            2.5-3.9&#13;
HIubei                                           2.2-3.5&#13;
Nei Mongol                                       3.0-4.1&#13;
Jiangxi                                          1.4-4.0&#13;
28.   A critical affordability issue is not average affordability, but rather affordability&#13;
by the poorer members of the village population. The poorest villagers will have&#13;
insufficient cash income to contribute capital during the construction phase or pay tariffs&#13;
during implementation. Some substitution of labor and materials for capital is possible,&#13;
but studies show that the poorest are often so because they are too incapacitated to join&#13;
fully in the working life of the village. In every village interview addressing this issue,&#13;
village leaders noted the existence of such households (indeed, the formal rural social&#13;
welfare system is structured around identified poor households). These households are&#13;
termed "five guarantee households," are primarily found among the childless elderly, and&#13;
consistently numbered no more than 1 percent of the population in villages visited by the&#13;
preappraisal mission. Fellow villagers are legally obliged to provide these households&#13;
with a stipulated array of subsistence support, and village leaders consistently reported&#13;
that the village would ensure access to safe water on behalf of the poorest village&#13;
members. In some cases, the village welfare fund will cover the costs of the poorest. In&#13;
others, common use, unmetered standpipes will be part of the system and accessible to all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115-                       ANNEX13&#13;
village members.  While such households are unlikely to be offered household&#13;
connections at communal expense, basic availability of safe water will be ensured.&#13;
29.   Perhaps those at greatest risk will be those households that have incomes just&#13;
above the level needed for special village poverty status. Such households will be able to&#13;
control their own metered consumption, whether at household tap or standpipe, but most&#13;
villages plan to assess the capital contribution on a per capita basis rather than an&#13;
estimated use basis. Families with low per capita use will therefore effectively subsidize&#13;
those with higher use levels. However, as with other project issues, experience under the&#13;
RWSS project provides good guidance on this issue. Under that project, access by the&#13;
poorer villagers has not been a serious problem, so it is unlikely to be so under this one.&#13;
E. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
30.   The major risks are here grouped under three general headings: implementation&#13;
and operational risks, regulatory risks, and risks to long-term sustainability.&#13;
Implementation and operational risks:&#13;
(a)   Project financing presents a risk due to the need for provincial, prefectural,&#13;
county, and beneficiary counterpart funding. The beneficiary funding&#13;
presents little risk, as systems would be allocated to those villages that are&#13;
most successful in fund collection. Here, then, only widespread loss of&#13;
income within a county, as could occur after, for example, a major flood,&#13;
would affect beneficiary financing.&#13;
Among the central, provincial, and local government levels, the local&#13;
governments have committed the highest percentage of counterpart funding,&#13;
averaging 23 percent of the total investment. Under RWSS, some counties&#13;
have caused financing delays through slow disbursement and others have&#13;
generally been unwilling to meet additional project costs induced by foreign&#13;
exchange rate changes. The first problem is endemic to the financial system,&#13;
wherein budget allocations are often made several months into the financial&#13;
year and, for discretionary payments, disbursement often even later than&#13;
that. The project has no answer to this problem, which is self-correcting in&#13;
the sense that the same delay occurs every year, but is rarely cumulative.&#13;
The proposed project disbursement profile reflects this experience. The&#13;
foreign exchange risk problem is being addressed more directly. In initial&#13;
counterpart funding calculations, counties were required to factor in Bank&#13;
Group-estimated purchasing power parity foreign exchange rates, hence&#13;
generated higher counterpart funding estimates in Yuan terms. County&#13;
obligations to meet foreign exchange impacts during the investment phase&#13;
have also been emphasized by SPC and MOF.&#13;
(b)   Related to the large number of water supply investments is the importance&#13;
of the project offices, of which there are 40 at county level, five provincial&#13;
level and one national. These offices play key roles in project design,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-                        ANNEX13&#13;
contracting, supervision, and training.  Analysis of the ongoing credit&#13;
showed that the supervision and training functions were generally&#13;
compromised by lack of funding. The available funds go first to water&#13;
supply design and contracting, often leaving little available for the equally&#13;
important supervision and training. The proposed project remedies this risk&#13;
through explicit project office functions and budgeting, with attendant&#13;
provision of administrative funding. For specific problems, such as ICB&#13;
procurement delays due to staff inexperience with ICB requirements, foreign&#13;
consultant assistance is being provided.  Training programs are being&#13;
designed during preparation with international consultant assistance. If&#13;
these various efforts do not live up to expectations, the outcome would be&#13;
performance similar to the current project, where overall design,&#13;
construction, and operations quality could be modestly improved and the&#13;
health education work substantially improved. However, despite some&#13;
shortcomings, execution of the current project is judged satisfactory.&#13;
(c)    The project financing createsforeign exchange and credit risks borne by the&#13;
provincial government. Under the project, once funds have been committed,&#13;
the village and county credit repayment obligations are fixed in Yuan terms&#13;
at the then-prevailing exchange rate. Foreign exchange risks are thereafter&#13;
shifted to provinces. This is important because the investments yield only a&#13;
local currency income stream and villages and counties have no instruments&#13;
available to mitigate the foreign exchange risk (unless they generate foreign&#13;
exchange through other operations-something rare for poor counties).&#13;
Although provinces also lack efficient mechanisms for handling these risks,&#13;
they typically control foreign exchange flows that are large relative to the&#13;
repayment requirements of the credit. Provincial assumption of these risks,&#13;
a necessary condition for participation in the credit, can be seen as a&#13;
provincial contribution to their poverty alleviation efforts. The risk has been&#13;
substantial during RWSS, where the Yuan has depreciated more than 50&#13;
percent since appraisal. The increased convertibility of the Yuan since that&#13;
time will reduce this risk.&#13;
(d)    The piped water systems will maintain independent accounts and generally&#13;
be managed as autonomous enterprises. The systems need efficient financial&#13;
and physical operation if water supply goals are to be met. The proposed&#13;
project bolsters training compared to that offered under the ongoing project&#13;
and provides for additional direct project office supervision. For the very&#13;
large projects, design review and audit requirements are also added. While&#13;
institutional innovation remains a project risk, that under the ongoing&#13;
project has been satisfactory, hence these risks are not judged great.&#13;
Regulatory risks:&#13;
(e)    Based on experience under RWSS, the major regulatory risk is that of&#13;
possible resistance to timely implementation of the required tariff structure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117-                       ANNEX13&#13;
for water. Under RWSS, local price bureaus sometimes intervene to block&#13;
tariffs large enough to sustain water plant operations. Where this happens,&#13;
water company performance incentives are seriously impaired, as is their&#13;
ability to finance maintenance of the system. To mitigate this risk, tariff&#13;
estimates are made as part of the feasibility study. These, and the agreed&#13;
pricing formula as stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement, will be&#13;
reviewed by local price bureaus prior to an investment being made. If the&#13;
price bureau cannot accept the agreed tariff approach, investments will be&#13;
redirected to other villages or counties.&#13;
Risks to long-term sustainability:&#13;
(f)    The major risks to long-term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and&#13;
have been discussed above. Additional risks are environmental and may&#13;
arise from outside of the villages themselves. They center on excessive&#13;
extraction from or polluting inputs to the various surface and groundwater&#13;
sources used by the water systems. Excess pollutant loads could force either&#13;
expensive raw water treatment or a move to alternative sources. Either&#13;
outcome could increase costs sufficiently to exceed benefits. Feasibility&#13;
studies consider environmental risks, and if these are adequately done, and&#13;
needed source protection measures are taken, the risks will be minimized.&#13;
The water supply system feasibility studies under RWSS appear to do a&#13;
good job within at least a five-year horizon. Water sources used in RWSS&#13;
project have shown no signs of quality deterioration. Despite that, in areas&#13;
of China losing water supply to depletion and pollution problems, the&#13;
rapidity and type of development often were simply not foreseen. Where&#13;
unanticipated development poses the greatest long-run threat, mitigation&#13;
depends more on a growing appreciation of the value of water as a resource&#13;
and of the importance of downstream impacts of water pollution than on&#13;
system-specific solutions. As water scarcity grows and more sources are&#13;
lost to pollution, China appears to be moving in that direction.&#13;
(g)   A more modest risk to long-term sustainability would arise from a failure of&#13;
the health education and sanitation program to induce significant change in&#13;
behavior. Clean water supplies complemented by improved health and&#13;
sanitation behavior produce the greatest benefits. However, behavioral&#13;
changes will be much more difficult to induce than clean water will be to&#13;
supply. When water systems function properly, water delivered to the&#13;
household could be directly consumed at no health risk and villagers may&#13;
feel they can cease boiling water. However, continued use of traditional&#13;
water storage vessels is likely and they pose the threat of reintroducing&#13;
pathogens. Health education will encourage regular cleaning of storage&#13;
vessels and continued boiling of water to guard against these problems. The&#13;
health education program will also stress water source protection, an issue&#13;
spoken to in the previous paragraph. The sanitation work tries to reduce a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
different source of pathogen loads, that from the traditional cycle of using&#13;
human excrement as a fertilizer, with transmission through the waste&#13;
handling. Two means of breaking the cycle will be addressed in the project.&#13;
The first is hand washing, itself facilitated by new water supplies. The&#13;
second is the use of composting toilets that destroy pathogens before the&#13;
excrement is reused. The project faces uncertainty over whether the existing&#13;
Chinese approach to health and sanitation work can be significantly&#13;
improved upon. If not, project areas would not realize gains from this&#13;
component relative to nonproject areas. Given the demonstrated difficulty&#13;
of this work, the risk is judged to be high. The project seeks to mitigate the&#13;
risk through the use of a KAP study to launch the work, complemented by&#13;
monitoring to provide feedback during the implementation period, allowing&#13;
the program to be modified throughout implementation.&#13;

            China - National Rural Water Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objective of the National
            Rural Water Supply Project is to provide access to safe,
            conveniently located water to 4.6 million poor rural people
            in Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces and Nei
            Mongol Autonomous Region, and to improve the water at the
            lowest possible cost and to ensure its sustainability
            through good maintenance and accounting practices. The core
            components are three: (1) Water supply -providing safe water
            to poor communities currently lacking such supplies, by
            maximizing community participation in selecting service
            alternatives, and supporting water system operator and
            accounting training to keep costs low and ensure project
            sustainability; (2) Sanitation and health education,
            involving working with primary school teachers, village
            doctors, Women's Federation representatives, and public
            health systems in their efforts to improve water use and
            sanitation practices in the villages by supporting
            demonstration programs to increase use of composting
            latrines, preparing health education messages aimed at
            expanding adopting improved sanitation and hygiene
            practices, primarily among housewives, school-aged children,
            and household decisionmakers, and training health education
            specialists; and (3) Project management, supporting
            increased project office capacity to service villages,
            including surveys and research, and training in procurement,
            water supply technologies, water quality protection, and
            health message delivery.
