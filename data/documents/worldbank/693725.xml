Project Description&#13;
Rural Works Program&#13;
I.    This component would enhance the participation of rural communities in the&#13;
maintenance of rural infrastructure, and during emergencies provide employment income.&#13;
The current drought has caused smalholders to rapidly use up savings and coffee sales&#13;
income in order to buy food. Seedstocks of the staple foodcrops (sweet potato, potato,&#13;
taro, maize etc.) are limited, and there is little margin of safety remaining to prevent&#13;
widespread food scarcity. The situation is particularly difficult in the socially unstable&#13;
Highlands region. In this context, international experience demonstrates that labor-&#13;
intensive rural public works projects are able to reach and protect the living standards of&#13;
vulnerable groups threatened by rnatural disasters, as well as to create and maintain rural&#13;
infrastructure'. The menu of eligible works would include, but not be restricted to,&#13;
maintenance of access roads, drains, erodible sites, schools, health facilities, sewerage&#13;
systems, airstrips, foot bridges and construction of gabion baskets. Criteria for micro-&#13;
project selection and the development of technical specifications for rural works were&#13;
agreed at negotiations. In addition, an understanding was reached at negotiations that an&#13;
acceptable format for project completion and hand-over would be used as a sign-off on&#13;
micro-projects. During emergencies, and to the extent possible, the project would ensure&#13;
that only one worker would come from each household, but not necessarily be the head of&#13;
household nor necessarily be male. In order to spread the benefits, great flexibility would&#13;
be allowed in approaches. For example, some districts could operate a two-week&#13;
rotational system in areas where labor supply is greater than demand.&#13;
2.    Key design features would incorporate lessons learned with similar programs&#13;
elsewhere, namely: (a) means tested transfers are rarely feasible in rural areas of&#13;
developing countries; (b) aim for wide coverage (reduces corruption by limiting&#13;
managerial discretion in selecting beneficiary households); (c) low wage rates which are&#13;
only attractive to the poor: as a maximum, the wage rate for casual agricultural labor is&#13;
often used, e.g. in PNG, a wage sufficient to purchase the basic food ration for a rural&#13;
family, i.e. monthly per capita minima of 8kg enriched rice, 2kg wholemeal flour and 1&#13;
liter of oil); (d) consistency with the long-term budget; (e) wage rates should be gender&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
neutral; (f) average share of unskilled wages in variable operating costs of works should&#13;
ensure balance between sufficient levels of transfer benefits to workers and maintenance&#13;
of technical standards (about two thirds is common in South Asia).&#13;
3.    To the extent possible, the project would encourage the community to provide at&#13;
least one worker from each household, but not necessarily the head of the household nor&#13;
necessarily male. In order to spread the benefits, a two-week rotational system could be&#13;
established in areas with a larger supply than demand for labor under the program. An&#13;
important benefit would be to empower communities to handle their own responses to&#13;
future disasters without direct handouts from Government, whose budgetary and&#13;
logistical capacities are, and likely will continue to be, limited.&#13;
4.    This component would not only enhance household food security during&#13;
emergencies but could also have an important income stabilizing effect between harvests&#13;
and "normal" years. Generation of employment would also help mitigate potentially&#13;
serious law and order situations in the Highlands2. The role of NGOs, churches, and the&#13;
private sector (CBOs) would be critical to effective implementation and monitoring of the&#13;
various practical delivery systems to be tested by districts and provinces under the&#13;
project. Community labor provided during emergencies would be treated differently than&#13;
under non-emergency situations as shown in Table 1. During emergencies, labor would&#13;
be paid for according to procedures similar to those outlined in paragraph 2. However, in&#13;
non-emergencies, and for community-specific public works (e.g. maintenance of schools,&#13;
village halls, health facilities and erosion control), labor would be provided free as a&#13;
community contribution. This would avoid creating a dependency syndrome and increase&#13;
commitment to the fundamental responsibilities of communities for such routine&#13;
maintenance. In contrast, works with a wider public good (e.g. maintenance of access&#13;
roads, airstrips, minor roads and foot bridges), which would normally be the&#13;
responsibility of local government councils, would be eligible for payment of labor&#13;
provided. The aim would be to enhance a system of community group contracting to&#13;
help mitigate the existing inadequate levels of Government maintenance. The additional&#13;
important benefit would be to raise the awareness of the need for quality maintenance by&#13;
local ward councils.&#13;
5.    A small provincial management team (3-5 people maximum)(PMT) would be set&#13;
up in each province comprising officers seconded from key Provincial Departments the&#13;
Provincial Administration and an observer from the Office of the Governor. The PMT&#13;
would be responsible for developing work programs, setting equitable criteria for labor&#13;
selection, approving requisitions, disbursing funds from the Provincial Account, and&#13;
being accountable for all project funds and reporting. A network of works supervisors&#13;
would be established at the local Government Council level to identify laborers with the&#13;
assistance of church pastors, village elders and NGOs. The latter groups would target the&#13;
neediest families and identify one to two members to work on the projects selected by the&#13;
communities themselves. A critical component of the entire program would be a major&#13;
2  Several examples exist of hiring youth groups to maintain community infrastructure, e.g. in the&#13;
National Capital District, Fanina and St. Charles Lwanga Catholic Youth Groups; in Central&#13;
Province, Avaroro Tapini, Obega, Fanau Dua, Kabuna and St. Stephen's Moregvina Catholic Youth&#13;
Groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
public awareness campaign beforehand to explain the details (fairness, equity and gender&#13;
neutrality) aspects of the program (Appendix 1). This component would be launched in&#13;
Simbu Province but would expand to other provinces once basic procedures have been&#13;
developed in Simbu. This "rolling" procedure would allow lessons learned to be&#13;
internalized before increasing the scale of the program. Eligibility criteria and procedures&#13;
for provinces were discussed at negotiations and included in the Minutes (Appendix 2 to&#13;
this Annex).&#13;
Rural Water Supply&#13;
6.    Background: Concerns about reliability, quality and shortages of water supplies&#13;
are significant issues in many rural areas of PNG, despite the high rainfall patterns in&#13;
"normal" years. It has been estimated that only 25 percent of the rural population has&#13;
access to safe water supply and appropriate levels of sanitation. A draft Sector Strategy&#13;
Note was prepared in December 1995 and a follow-up proposal for donor assistance in&#13;
November 19973. The latter document identifies several aspects of the rural water&#13;
dilemma which the current drought has brought into sharp focus, namely:&#13;
(a)   permanent, clean potable water systems are needed in key population centers;&#13;
(b)   success will depend on an extensive community consultation process;&#13;
(c)   provincial authorities do have a role to play in developing schemes; however,&#13;
mechanisms need to be found to engage end users and community organizations&#13;
in the construction and more importantly the maintenance of systems. In this&#13;
respect, particular importance  must be given  to  long-term  community&#13;
maintenance of systems since Provincial authorities are unlikely to be able to&#13;
meet these expenses, and community experience to date has not been good;&#13;
(d)   collection of data and statistics on rainfall and river flow has been allowed to&#13;
seriously run down in the past three years, complicating response strategies;&#13;
(e)   different delivery options need to be tested, the results of which may vary between&#13;
provinces;&#13;
(f)   the NGO community, churches, and the private sector have a critical role to play&#13;
in making an overall improvement in rural service delivery;&#13;
(g)   on the mainland, the current drought indicates the problem is more one of quality&#13;
than quantity unlike in the smaller islands where an absolute lack of rural water&#13;
supplies is a key constraint;&#13;

(h)    service delivery is relatively easier along the coast where more people live in&#13;
villages than in the Highlands where people are more dispersed, live in tiny&#13;
hamlets and are not linked by a road network, which complicate administrative&#13;
processes; and,&#13;
(i)   the current drought emergency offers opportunity to experiment with different&#13;
implementation schemes in different provinces.&#13;
7.    The proposed water supply component's main objectives therefore are:&#13;
(a)   to provide sustainable water supply facilities to the most needy parts of the&#13;
targeted provinces;&#13;
(b)   the construction and/or rehabilitation of sustainable water supply sources at&#13;
strategic centers, e.g. schools, hospitals, or provincial/district centers which could&#13;
be a focal point for water supply during a drought;&#13;
(c)   to develop an effective methodology for integrating rural water supply with&#13;
community mobilization including village level maintenance of all facilities;&#13;
(d)   to improve/upgrade the technical skills of personnel involved in developing rural&#13;
water supply schemes;&#13;
(e)   to strengthen institutions in the rural water supply sector at provincial levels; and&#13;
(f)   to improve the information feedback from the provinces to national institutions.&#13;
8.     The project would provide sustainable, safe, clean water supply to the most needy&#13;
areas in five targeted provinces of the eight not currently covered/inactive under the EU's&#13;
Rural Water Supply Program (Manus, Western, Gulf, Enga, Southern Highlands, Oro,&#13;
Morobe, and also Simbu if it remains inactive). The EU program is currently under&#13;
review for possible reorientation since it focuses primarily on rainfed catchment tanks&#13;
operated through Provincial Departments of Health. The proposed Bank project would&#13;
aim to rehabilitate and or construct new groundwater supply sources at strategic locations&#13;
including schools, hospitals, health posts, and district centers. Excess capacity would be&#13;
provided at these locations to allow them to service overall community demands during&#13;
periods of acute water shortage. Drought-proof water supplies   would include&#13;
boreholes/wells and gravity systems from reservoirs'.&#13;
9.    It would improve/upgrade the technical skills of personnel involved in developing&#13;
rural water supply schemes, institutional capacity and logistical support at the provincial&#13;
level, improved feedback from provinces to national institutions. A priority listing of&#13;
4   The cost of developing a successful borehole (handpump, manual drilling equipment, bore liners and&#13;
labor) has been estimated by the Geological Survey of PNG at about K. 20,000 to deliver at least&#13;
5,000 I/day to 250 people @ normal consumption rates (20 I/pers.) or up to 1,000 people during&#13;
droughts (5 Vpers.). A tentative assessment of successful boring rate is 60%, i.e. 10 of every 25&#13;
boreholes would not locate water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
strategic sites would be developed by provincial authorities with the assistance of local&#13;
church organizations, NGOs and district-level authorities who would also play an&#13;
important role in identifying labor to construct the simple/easily maintained systems.&#13;
UNICEF and WHO would be invited to participate in important complementary&#13;
activities: health education, hygiene and social mobilization (UNICEF), and in sanitation&#13;
(WHO). In the latter context, an important emphasis would be given to assist women's&#13;
groups in health awareness, education, and management of village water systems&#13;
including maintenance of water pumps, etc.&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
10.  Implementation Arrangements.   Project management would be heavily&#13;
decentralized to the district level, and approaches would vary depending on the prevailing&#13;
conditions in each province. It would also be flexible enough to allow some provinces to&#13;
use NGOs, CBOs, and church organizations to implement progress.  A mix of&#13;
government, NGO, CBO, church and other relevant structures would be tested. However,&#13;
an element of overall coordination will be required for administrative purposes. A small&#13;
Project Coordination and Facilitation Unit (PCFU) would be set up in the Ministry of&#13;
Provincial and Local Government Affairs to handle the day-to-day management of the&#13;
project, liaison with the provinces and NARI, and overall project monitoring and&#13;
reporting. The successful experience of the ongoing Gazelle Restoration Program&#13;
exemplifies the level of administrative management and autonomy which needs to be&#13;
vested in the PCFU.  The Project Manager would report directly to the Secretary of&#13;
Provincial and Local Government Affairs but would have complete authority/autonomy&#13;
to act directly with the provinces on implementation of the water supply and rural works&#13;
components. The Minister could convene an informal task force comprising&#13;
representatives of participating agencies and other relevant Government agencies,&#13;
including the Prime Minister's Department, to resolve intractable major issues of a&#13;
multisectoral or cross-provincial nature and to review progress and action plans. The&#13;
PCFU would be headed by an individual with recognized levels of professional integrity&#13;
and management experience (preferably in emergency programs in PNG). The PCFU&#13;
would comprise the Project Manager,  two administrative personnel (one with&#13;
professional accounting skills) and two support staff.&#13;
11.   An attempt will be made to ensure gender balance in the PCFU.  An&#13;
organizational flow chart is shown in Appendix 3, and draft terms of reference for the&#13;
Project Manager in Appendix 4. The estimated annual costs to operate the PCFU are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Project Manager                  K 85,000&#13;
Accountant                         50,000&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
Public Awareness Campaigns'&#13;
As part of the overall strategy to promote the community works and water supply&#13;
programns in the villages, it will be necessary to prepare the population in this&#13;
development initiative. A first action will be to conduct awareness campaigns to educate&#13;
and inform the public. A three-stage campaign will be conducted and targeted at different&#13;
categories of audience, all of whom may be affected and/or involved to varying degrees.&#13;
Strategy of Campaign: Bridge the Crucial Link&#13;
The crucial link between the Provincial and the Local Level Governments (LLG)&#13;
is critical. The Governor of the Province is elected by people of the province and the&#13;
Deputy is elected head of the LLGs in the province. Since the projects are village/&#13;
council/ward-based, these separate levels of government must be adequately informed in&#13;
order to receive their fullest cooperation and participation. This awareness processes will&#13;
be rolling and iterative.&#13;
The Campaign&#13;
Target Groups&#13;
The campaign will be targeted at various groups in the province who will be&#13;
affected in one way or another by the community-based development projects. First are&#13;
the various levels of political and local level governments. Secondly the civil service&#13;
which will be the vehicle of service delivery must be thoroughly informed. Thirdly the&#13;
masses of rural people for whom and with whom the projects will be developed must be&#13;
adequately informed to the stage where they will reciprocate in willing participation.&#13;
Others in the community who will be indirectly affected are churches, NGOs, traders and&#13;
the business community.&#13;
Issues&#13;
The following issues will form the core of the campaign message:&#13;
objectives, scope and characteristics of the project;&#13;
assistance to emergency areas rated Category 4-5;&#13;
-     project ownership and sustainability concerns and issues;&#13;
-     community participation;&#13;
-     labor supply; and,&#13;
-     land, materials, etc., sweat equity contribution by the beneficiaries.&#13;
5  Developed by provincial representatives during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
stage I&#13;
The awareness campaign vvill be conducted in three stages:&#13;
The first crucial step in the awareness process will be to have the Manager of the&#13;
PCFU join the Governor and his Deputy in a joint press release, announcing the program&#13;
in the province. The message would be general in scope targeted at setting in motion the&#13;
public service machinery and the LLGs to diffuse the message through the various levels&#13;
of the community.&#13;
Stage 2&#13;
T1he announcement by the political head of the province sets in motion the&#13;
provincial administrative machinery for forward planning and action. This will require a&#13;
focused and in-depth awareness aimed at clarifying roles of civil servants and&#13;
mobilization and deployment of resources. The awareness is conducted in formal&#13;
meetings which aims at defining purpose, objectives, scope and characteristics of&#13;
projects. Represented in this meeting will be senior public servants of divisions of health,&#13;
agriculture, provincial affairs, provincial works, water board, council executive officer&#13;
and district managers. The meeting is chaired by the Provincial Administrator. At this&#13;
stage selected NGOs, church representatives, community groups, and other potential&#13;
players are invited to participate. Department of Planning should participate at this stage&#13;
of the campaign. Relevant training would be carried out at this stage.&#13;
Stage 3&#13;
The stage 2 meeting sets in motion a process of awareness at the district/council/&#13;
ward levels. District Managers whose districts will be beneficiaries of such projects will&#13;
intensively conduct the campaign. The awareness here will involve inforning the&#13;
councillors and their ward citizens of their role in the development process. Local&#13;
churches, NGOs and other potential players will participate.&#13;
TIMING OF STAGES&#13;
Stage 1: Before the sub-project actually commences in the districts, immediately&#13;
after the joint news conference.&#13;
Stage 2: The provincial administrator and his staff should be given time to set out&#13;
a strategy and action plan, have it checked by relevant national government departments,&#13;
and discussed with Governor. Only after this background work is completed, and a&#13;
strategy firmly established, should the Stage 2 awareness be conducted. This may take&#13;
from 2 to 4 weeks before beginning Stage 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Stage 3: This is conducted at selected districts at those sub-project sites,&#13;
preferably 1 to 2 weeks before commencement of project. But this awareness process is&#13;
iterative and continuous. The actual sub-project implementation should not commence in&#13;
a specific district until there is a perceived judgment of a thorough and complete&#13;
understanding and acceptance of the message, and adherence to the terms of reference of&#13;
the communities' participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
APPENDIX 2&#13;
Community Project Selection Criteria and Procedures&#13;
The community activities (contracts) would cover four different classes of sub-projects&#13;
(see Table 1):&#13;
A. community water supply development;&#13;
B. maintenance of civil works which have benefits for the community and a&#13;
wider group;&#13;
C. maintenance of communal civil works in an emergency situation;6 and,&#13;
D. maintenance of communal civil works in a non-emergency environment.&#13;
Principles:&#13;
* Works would be undertaken through contracts between village communities&#13;
and District Administrator (Provincial and Local Government Affairs&#13;
Department).&#13;
*  Each sub-project would respond to the expressed needs and wishes of the&#13;
community.&#13;
*  Community participation and contribution to the sub-project would be&#13;
maximized.&#13;
*  Sub-projects would lbe assessed as technically feasible and water supply sub-&#13;
projects would be of a scale and cost appropriate for the number of&#13;
beneficiaries and the benefits to be obtained.&#13;
*  The participation of women and youth groups would be actively promoted.&#13;
*  Project works would not cause involuntary land acquisition nor involuntary&#13;
displacement of people.&#13;
*  Routine maintenance of roads and roadside drains would ensure due attention&#13;
to erosion control.&#13;
*  Boreholes and wells would be designed with adequate covers to avoid&#13;
pollution of the water source, and drainage would be provided at outlets to&#13;
avoid the creation oif environments conducive to mosquito breeding.&#13;
*  No sub-project would be financed which would lead to an adverse&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
6 "Emergency" situation as classified by the Departmnent of Provincial and Local Government Affairs&#13;
as Categories 4 or 5 for Food Supply (Annex 2, paragraph 29).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
* In development of water supplies, the sustainable operation of the system&#13;
(especially mechanical components) and the permanence of the water source&#13;
would be of paramount importance.&#13;
*  In designing permanent water supply at strategic sits in a community, the&#13;
capacity of the delivery system or systems should be geared to the&#13;
exceptional demand situation in the wider community who would have to&#13;
depend on this source during periods of drought.&#13;
* Land mediators may be used to resolve disputes; however, if they are&#13;
unsuccessful, the sub-project would not be eligible for financing under the&#13;
project.&#13;
Outline of Procedures in Selection Process:&#13;
* In each of the participating provinces, provincial, district and ward&#13;
(community) officials would be made aware of the program objectives and&#13;
characteristics (see Appendix 2 and 3).&#13;
* Communities would express interest in participation via their Ward&#13;
Councillor and District Administrator to the provincial project committee.&#13;
*  District Administrator's technical staff would visit communities, in order to&#13;
(i) explain the programs and stress the community-participation requirements&#13;
(with payment for community labor being made only in exceptional&#13;
emergency circumstances - Type (C) - or for Type (B) activity; (ii) facilitate,&#13;
with assistance of relevant church representatives and/or NGOs whenever&#13;
possible, the community process of defining sub-projects that meet their&#13;
needs and in which they would participate if the projects proved to be&#13;
technically feasible.&#13;
* Provincial technical staff would assess feasibility and prepare specifications&#13;
and costs, which would be checked and approved (or otherwise) at the&#13;
provincial level by expert staff. Additional technical support in system&#13;
design would be hired or contracted as necessary.&#13;
* For suitable sub-projects, contracts between a participating community would&#13;
be drawn up specifying responsibilities of all parties, and signed by the Ward&#13;
Councillor, the chairman of the village community, a local church and/or&#13;
reputable NGO, and by District Administrator (or his nominee) on behalf of&#13;
the project. For the initial 10 sub-projects from each participating province,&#13;
the manager of the PCFU in Port Moresby would sign off on each project to&#13;
ensure compliance with project requirements.&#13;
* Action officers would raw up detailed implementation plans for each sub-&#13;
project; ensure any necessary procurement of inputs at the provincial level;&#13;
and organize technical assistance during implementation, supervision and&#13;
monitoring of work progress, and eventual certification of completion (by the&#13;
community, the project, and an independent authority such as a local church&#13;
representative).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* To facilitate the review process and enable effective monitoring, a series of&#13;
forms would be designed by the PCFU to describe the characteristics of each&#13;
sub-project and to record its compliance with project requirements. For the&#13;
water development sub-projects, which represent new investment or major&#13;
reconstruction as opposed to maintenance activities under the rural works&#13;
program, the forms would indicate, inter alia:&#13;
=&gt;  agreement on satisfactory labor arrangements by the community, and&#13;
their provision of local materials and free accommodation and meals for&#13;
project staff during implementation;&#13;
=&gt;  agreement on future maintenance arrangements and verification that a&#13;
Maintenance Fund (along the lines used by the Government Rural&#13;
Water Supply Program supported by the EU) had been initiated;&#13;
=&gt;  requirements of land and a permnanent water source for development of&#13;
the supply would be available free of encumbrances and disputes,&#13;
verified by a local church official;&#13;
=&gt;  a record that the development will not have any significant negative&#13;
environmental impact, and will not have a detrimental impact on social&#13;
harmony or equity considerations in the community;&#13;
a description of the project, key technical specifications and costs, and&#13;
timeframe for implementation; contributions of each entity -&#13;
community, local and provincial government entities (broken down by&#13;
the development budget supported by the Bank loan and from the&#13;
recurrent budget of government agencies) - would be identified;&#13;
=   a record of the type of participation in the total process by any church&#13;
officials or NGOs;&#13;
=&gt;  eventually, a completion certificate which verifies the satisfactory&#13;
installment (or otherwise) of the facility, and records the status of&#13;
maintenance arrangements (including the maintenance fund); the&#13;
community representative, project staff, the District Administrator and&#13;
the local church representative would be signatories to this certificate;&#13;
=&gt;  the status of the investment during a follow-up visit carried out between&#13;
6 to 12 months after completion.&#13;
For the rural works component a less comprehensive set of forms would be&#13;
developed, but these would record the key features by type of investment and&#13;
costs, contribution by each party, type of beneficiaries and overall benefits.&#13;

Government of Papua New Guinea&#13;
Ministry of Provincial and Local Government Affairs&#13;
Position of Project Manager&#13;
Background and Objectives&#13;
The Government of Papua New Guinea, with financial support from the World&#13;
Bank, proposes to implement an El Nino Drought Emergency Project, which would aim&#13;
to help rural people cope better with drought and other natural disasters. The project&#13;
would apply decentralized approaches to deliver basic rural services to eligible local&#13;
communities. Churches, NGOs, and the private sector would facilitate this process.&#13;
Project components would include improving rural potable water supplies, developing&#13;
community rural works programs, and agricultural research studies. An additional goal&#13;
would be to improve the capacity of village groups to more effectively handle future&#13;
crises themselves.&#13;
Job Description&#13;
Project management would be heavily decentralized to the local level. A Project&#13;
Coordination and Facilitation Unit (PCFU) would be set up in the Ministry of Provincial&#13;
and Local Govemment Affairs to handle the day-to-day management of the project, liaise&#13;
with the provinces and the National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), and carry out&#13;
overall project monitoring and reporting. It would also oversee the promotion and&#13;
implementation of a public awareness program, facilitate the flow of funds and approve&#13;
procurement processes (except NARI studies). The Project Manager would report&#13;
directly to the Secretary for Provincial and Local Government Affairs and would have&#13;
authority to act directly with the provinces, districts and community level organizations&#13;
on implementation of the rural water supply and rural works components. The PCFU&#13;
would comprise the Project Manager, two administrative personnel (one with&#13;
professional accounting skills) and two support staff.&#13;
Qualifications&#13;
-     Highest levels of professional and personal integrity&#13;
-     Project management experience in Papua New Guinea, preferably with emergency&#13;
programs&#13;
-     Thorough knowledge of PNG national and provincial institutions&#13;
-     Proven ability to work with community organizations, church groups and NGOs&#13;
-     Strong negotiation and conflict resolution skills&#13;
-     Ability to travel extensively in rural areas.&#13;

PAPUA NEW GUINEA&#13;
EL NiNo DROUGHTRESPONSE PROJECT&#13;
Background to 1997/98 El Nino Event&#13;
1.    Backgroundj  El Niflo is an abnormal tropical Pacific Ocean weather pattern&#13;
occurring at irregular intervals, which results in an elevation of surface water&#13;
temperatures in the Ocean and causes significant rainfall and floods in some areas and&#13;
droughts in others. In Latin America, its effects were first observed around Christmas,&#13;
leading local fishermen a long timne ago to call it El Ninio, or Spanish for the Christ child.&#13;
Climate scientists now link this oceanographic phenomenon with a related atmospheric&#13;
event known as the "Southern Oscillation", hence the term El Ni-no-Southem Oscillation&#13;
(ENSO). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that this ENSO phenomenon&#13;
contributes to, or is responsible for, anomalous weather patterns throughout the world,&#13;
sometimes of disastrous proportions. The 1982-83 El Nifio has been the strongest such&#13;
event of this century, with widespread incidence of drought, flooding and severe storms&#13;
in five continents, and economic losses estimated by some to be in excess of US$14&#13;
billion. The magnitude of the surface water temperature anomalies observed in the&#13;
evolution of the current El Niino, in conjunction with modem forecasting techniques, have&#13;
led some climatologists to predict that its impact could exceed that of the 1982-83 event.&#13;
2.    Papua New Guinea is the most populous nation in the South Pacific with a&#13;
population of 4.0 million and annual growth rate of 2.3 percent. In normal years, rainfall&#13;
exceeds 2,500 mm in most parts of the country, ranging from about 1,000 mm in Port&#13;
Moresby to over 10,000 mm in areas of the highlands. Despite seemingly plentiful&#13;
rainfall, the country has been affected by a series of droughts over the last 30 years, in&#13;
1972/3, 1982/3, 1987/8, 1991/2, and currently 1997/8. It is now accepted that these&#13;
droughts are linked to an El Nifno effect.&#13;
3.   In Papua New Guinea in 1997, the effects of these changes in Pacific circulation&#13;
systems were felt almost immediately.' First, rain across almost the whole country was&#13;
significantly reduced from "normal" falls. For example, in one of the wettest places in&#13;
the country, Tabubil, only 68 mm of rain fell in July, compared to a normal average of&#13;
614 mm for that month. In August, only 32 mm was received compared to the average of&#13;
870 mm. No rain fell in the first two weeks of September. Anecdotal accounts from&#13;
many parts of the country suggest rainfall all but ceased in May-June, but there has been&#13;
considerable variation in the actual pattern.&#13;
4.    The outcome has been a severe reduction in crop yields. Local springs and small&#13;
streams which provided drinking water to hundreds of small communities have dried up,&#13;
forcing people to travel further to larger streams for drinking water. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
widespread fires have occurred in grasslands and forests, from the coast to the tops of the&#13;
highest mountain ranges. Fires have destroyed many existing gardens, stands of sago&#13;
palm and in some cases, houses and property.&#13;
5.    Second, at altitudes of more than 2,200 m above sea level, cloudless night skies&#13;
allow heat to radiate from the ground surface such that ground level temperatures may&#13;
fall to below 0°C. At Tambul in the Western Highlands, temperatures fell to below&#13;
freezing in June and July. In the second week of August, temperatures were below zero&#13;
four nights in a row and in September for eight nights in succession. The coldest night in&#13;
September was -2.3°C. There were a further three frosts in mid-October. This was&#13;
reflected throughout the high altitude mountain basins. The recurrence, duration and&#13;
coldness of these temperatures killed all top growth in sweet potato in the fields and&#13;
destroyed all attempts to replant and re-establish gardens. The very low temperatures on&#13;
some nights also appears to have damaged tubers in the ground and rendered them unfit&#13;
for consumption. Natural vegetation including grasses, pandanus groves and even forest&#13;
trees were killed by these frosts. In many places, the drying dead vegetation was later&#13;
burned.&#13;
Food Supply&#13;
6.    To fully understand the potential impact of the present crisis in PNG, a basic&#13;
knowledge of the food supply system is needed. The Australian National University in&#13;
collaboration with GOPNG's Department of Agriculture and livestock (DAL), has&#13;
recently completed a seven-year research project, funded partly by AusAID, which&#13;
describes and maps agricultural systems throughout Papua New Guinea. This exceptional&#13;
information source is linked to a database containing detailed information on natural&#13;
resources. The mapping scale is 1:500,000.&#13;
7.    Approximately 65 percent of the population depend on sweet potato as a staple&#13;
food and a further 15 percent depend upon sago palm as a staple. Sago is not grown in&#13;
gardens, but is harvested from planted and wild stands, which take 12-15 years to mature&#13;
and require large amounts of water to process starch from its trunk. The next most&#13;
important crop is banana, which is increasingly cultivated for five to ten years, before&#13;
land is left in fallow.2&#13;
Highlands Sweet Potato Systems&#13;
8.    The large highlands populations depend heavily on the continuous cultivation of&#13;
sweet potato. Since planting and harvesting occurs continuously, any disruptions to&#13;
planting causes important reductions in the food supply. At altitudes up to 1,500 m, the&#13;
sweet potato growing cycle is about 5-6 months, thereafter the cycle extends to about 9-&#13;
12 months up to its limit of about 2,700 m.&#13;
9.    An important feature of the highlands sweet potato systems are the number of pigs&#13;
which are supported. For the entire region, the human to pig ratio is about 1:1, with&#13;
about half of all sweet potato production normally being fed to pigs, usually the smallest&#13;
tubers. A good indication of food scarcity is people beginning to eat tubers normally&#13;
reserved for pigs. This situation began in September 1997 in many highlands areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
10.   Sweet potato, an introduced crop enabled people to colonize the high altitude&#13;
areas, which have been occupied only for the last 300 years. The effect of a single frost&#13;
on sweet potato plants depends on the stage of development of the plant. If a frost occurs&#13;
within one to two months after planting, the plant becomes dormant for up to a month but&#13;
does begin to grow again. If frosted 5 to 6 months after planting, the dormancy is longer&#13;
and the plant may die and the tubers in the ground will immediately rot. In plants frosted&#13;
9-12 months after planting, the top growth may die, but tubers in the ground may remain&#13;
edible for up to two months.&#13;
11.   A sweet potato food production system can therefore easily handle single frost&#13;
events. However, a series of frosts, especially if they occur a number of weeks apart (like&#13;
this year) and which repeatedly kills top growth and damages tubers in the ground, will&#13;
effectively stop all food production for up to 12 months. A series of frosts also destroys&#13;
all green planting material. Following the frosts, tubers remaining in the ground can be&#13;
eaten, to the point where either the supply is finished or insect damage and rotting makes&#13;
them inedible. Thus for some time, after a series of frosts, there is food available but&#13;
inevitably a period of absolute lack of food follows, as is happening at present. The&#13;
earlier historical response to this situation was migration to lower areas, and the gradual&#13;
re-establishment of gardens with new planting materials in lower areas.  Today,&#13;
population pressures make this movement difficult.&#13;
12.   Sweet potato is a hardy and drought-resistant plant. Lack of rain for a time does&#13;
not kill sweet potato vines, but tuber yields become increasingly depressed, vine growth&#13;
ceases and the plant becomes almost dormant. When rain returns, there is a period of up&#13;
to four months during which vines are not suitable for planting. Once again, food&#13;
remains available until all edible tubers in the ground are consumed, but an inevitable&#13;
period of no food production approaches, the length of which is determined by the time it&#13;
takes the vines to grow to a viable length plus the normal crop cycle.&#13;
Lowlands Shij?ing Cultivation Systems&#13;
13.   Shifting cultivation systems involve the annual clearing of land from fallow which&#13;
may be covered in tall grasses, scrub or tall forest, depending on the length of the fallow&#13;
period and environmental conditions in the area. Fallow vegetation is typically cut down,&#13;
allowed to dry and burned. Planting material from last year's garden is carried to the new&#13;
garden and planted. Most families will have two gardens in operation at any time, and&#13;
many will have more than two. Gardens are commonly cleared towards the end of the&#13;
drier season (July to September in many parts of PNG but not all - in some places the&#13;
seasons are reversed) and are planted in advance of rains in November and December.&#13;
The drought in 1997 has significantly decreased production from gardens planted in&#13;
1996, to the extent that it appears many families have been forced to consume at least part&#13;
of their planting stock, or their planting stock is significantly reduced. Some of the fires&#13;
that have swept the countryside were set to clear land for planting in 1997. Unfortunately,&#13;
many of these escaped into dry vegetation surrounding the new garden sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
Other Food Sources&#13;
14.   A wide range of trees are grown in PNG for their leaves, fruits and nuts. In the&#13;
past, the nuts in particular have been critical seasonal components in the food supply&#13;
system especially in areas with strong dry seasons. In the highlands, this includes three&#13;
species of pandanus. In the lowlands, coconut is the most important followed by a range&#13;
of plants including Polynesian chestnut, breadfruit, sea almond, galip nut (Canarium&#13;
indicum), okari nut (Terminalia kaernbachii), Pometia pinnata and Castanopsis&#13;
accuminatissima. Little is known about productive performance of these trees under&#13;
severe drought conditions, but in previous food shortages, they have proved critical to&#13;
survival until garden foods returned to production.&#13;
Famine Foods&#13;
15.   Many PNG communities have foods that are not normally eaten, but can be eaten&#13;
during times of famine. They include Pueraria lobata, varieties of "wild" yams&#13;
(Dioscorea spp), non-planted taro-like species, green pawpaw fruit, leaves and fruit of&#13;
various figs (Ficus spp), stems of Chinese taro (Xanthosoma), various green leaves, ferns&#13;
and other unidentified plants. People also commonly talk about eating the basal portion&#13;
of banana stems. During the September 1997 drought assessment, these plants and others&#13;
were recorded as being eaten by some villagers.&#13;
16.   Many of these foods are unpalatable and cause mild to severe indigestion and&#13;
diarrhea. Where people are eating these foods, other sources of food have already been&#13;
depleted.&#13;
Water&#13;
17.   Under normal circumstances, most rural communities in PNG collect drinking&#13;
water from numerous very localized sources. Very few communities use larger streams&#13;
or rivers as sources of drinking water. People are acutely aware that larger streams and&#13;
rivers are contaminated by human and animal wastes, and importantly by commercial&#13;
pollution. In some areas, drinking water is restricted and of poor quality even in normal&#13;
times. On small islands and atolls and in limestone areas there may be little surface&#13;
water. Some coastal communities draw water from freshwater outflows which appear on&#13;
fringing reefs at low tide. This water is often contaminated and brackish.&#13;
18.  Introduced water supply schemes are not well developed in rural areas and many&#13;
which do exist are poorly maintained. Often, disputes over clan ownership of water, if&#13;
not resolved quickly, may result in sabotage. Technical problems also plague many&#13;
schemes, in particular pump breakage, problems with intakes and lack of capacity.&#13;
19.   A drought of the dimension of 1997 has forced people to fall back on larger&#13;
streams and rivers and to carry water for considerable distances. There is little doubt&#13;
many of the present sources of drinking water are contaminated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Assessment of Current Drought&#13;
20.   Two rapid, country-wide assessments have been carried out in September and&#13;
December 1997.  Individual communities have been mapped using the following&#13;
categories:&#13;
Food Supply Categories&#13;
I.    Unusually dry, but no real food supply problems.&#13;
2.    Some inconvenience. Staple food is short but other food is available and&#13;
health is okay.&#13;
3.    Difficult with food short and some famine food being eaten. Some babies&#13;
and old people may be unwell. No lives at risk.&#13;
4.    Very little food in gardens and it will not last for more than 3 weeks.&#13;
Famine food being eaten by many people. There is said to be increasing&#13;
sickness and there are signs of poor nutrition. The lives of small children&#13;
and old people are at risk.&#13;
5.   No food left in gardens. Only famine food available. An extreme&#13;
situation with many people not eating and small children and old people&#13;
dying.&#13;
Water Supply Categories&#13;
1.    No local drinking water problems.&#13;
2.    Local water sources dry. Good alternative sources available elsewhere.&#13;
3.    Local water sources dry. Alternative sources available, possibly slightly&#13;
polluted, and at some distance.&#13;
4.    Either small amounts of poor quality water available locally or better&#13;
quality water available only at very long distances.&#13;
5.    Water supply extremely limited, of very poor quality, salty, or dirty, and&#13;
probably contaminated, possibly available only at long distances.&#13;

Impact of Drought and Frosts in Papua New Guinea&#13;
(UpdatedAssessment - December 1997)&#13;
1.    There has been good rainfall, but still below average, in late-November to mid-&#13;
December in much of the Islands, Highlands and Mamose (New Guinea north coast)&#13;
Regions and in the mountains of the Southern Region. The coastal and lowlands parts of&#13;
the Southern Region have received very little rain in November-December and have been&#13;
in drought conditions since early 1997. This includes the southem part of Western&#13;
Province, coastal Gulf and Central provinces and parts of mainland Milne Bay. Very&#13;
little rainfall has been received in the catchment of Sirinumu Darn which provides water&#13;
for electricity generation and for Port Moresby City. Climatologists are still predicting&#13;
low average rainfall until March-May 1998, and then a resumption of normal patterns&#13;
with the conclusion of the El Niflo event.&#13;
2.    The village food situation continues to deteriorate in a more-or-less predictable&#13;
manner. The worst affected regions are the central highlands and the inland locations.&#13;
However, other locations are now experiencing very severe or extreme food supply&#13;
problems, for example, parts of inland New Britain and remote parts of New Ireland.&#13;
Final numbers of affected people are still not available, but for the Highland Region&#13;
alone, there are now 628,000 people in Category 4 or 5 (severe or extreme situation).&#13;
This is about four times the number of people in these categories in mid-October&#13;
(162,000 people). We anticipate that the food situation will continue to deteriorate with&#13;
the worst period being January-April. This is because of the current food supply; the&#13;
impact of rain on sprouting of tubers in the soil; and the depletion of cash reserves in&#13;
coffee growing locations about 1200 metres. Then food supply should improve rapidly&#13;
from May-June onwards in much of Papua New Guinea.&#13;
3.    The water supply situation has improved considerably in much of Papua New&#13;
Guinea with the recent rain. Provided that some rain continues over the coming four&#13;
months, this improved situation should continue. In parts of the Southern Region and on&#13;
certain islands, water supply is critical and is deteriorating. For example, villagers have&#13;
abandoned certain coastal locations in the western part of Gulf Province because of the&#13;
lack of drinking water.&#13;
4.    Reliable information on the impact of the drought and frosts on health of rural&#13;
villages is scarce. However, there are many reports by villagers and health professions in&#13;
Health Centres and Health Sub-centres of increases in a number of common illnesses&#13;
including diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, malaria, skin diseases and typhoid. There are&#13;
many unconfirmed reports of deaths amongst adults associated with the drought and&#13;
frosts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
5.    Rural villagers in many parts of Papua New Guinea have migrated to urban&#13;
centres, including Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Goroka and Mt. Hagen seeking food and&#13;
water from urban-based relatives who have access to cash income. There is no reliable&#13;
estimate of the number of people, but we estimate that many thousands of people have&#13;
moved to urban locations. There is some anecdotal evidence that this is associated with&#13;
an increase in crime in these centres.&#13;
6.    Food aid is being provided by AusAID to villagers in locations where the impact&#13;
has been assessed as extreme (Category 5) and where access is via aircraft only. In&#13;
practice, food aid is being delivered to some 60,000 people in parts of five provinces,&#13;
mainly in the Southern Region. The Papua New Guinea govermment, through the&#13;
National Disaster and Emergency Service, has now purchased food for the first round of&#13;
food aid. This is to be delivered to provincial capitals and from there it will be the&#13;
responsibility of provincial authorities to deliver the food. Small quantities of food were&#13;
provided by provincial authorities and politicians from funds released in September.&#13;
There are indications that distribution of food was very uneven; that many needy people&#13;
received very little or no food; and that it was often not distributed beyond the road&#13;
network.&#13;

APPENDIX 2&#13;
A Note on Subsistence Cycles in PNG&#13;
1.    Definite planting cycles have been observed in the subsistence food production&#13;
system in the highlands., These are similar to the well-known "hog cycle" in western&#13;
economies, also described as the cobweb theorem. The cycles cause some of the food&#13;
shortages that occur in the highlands. When the staple sweet potato is scarce for&#13;
whatever reason, women increase the planting rate. Also men increase the rate of land&#13;
clearance from fallow. The combination of an increased planting rate and the use of&#13;
more fertile land results in a surplus food supply about 8-12 months after the initial phase&#13;
of food shortage is over. Thereafter, with food especially abundant, women reduce the&#13;
planting rate greatly, for example, from 120m2 per woman per week to 20 m2 per woman&#13;
per week. The men also reduce or stop clearing land from fallow and the vegetation. The&#13;
combination of these two sets of actions results in a large drop in the subsistence food&#13;
supply about 20-24 months after the commencement of the first event.&#13;
2.    It appears therefore that food shortages in PNG tend to occur as paired events.&#13;
Typically, the first is caused by a climatic extreme, such as excessive rainfall or drought&#13;
or frost, or quite commonly a combination of these climatic extremes. The second food&#13;
shortage does not necessarily follow a climatic event. An example of these paired events&#13;
can be given for the Kainantu area of the Eastern Highlands. Food supply is not&#13;
particularly vulnerable in this region and there have been only seven recorded subsistence&#13;
food shortages over the 50 year period: 1935 to 1984. Six of the seven recorded events&#13;
occurred about two years apart. This pattern was common in 10 similar data sets from&#13;
other locations in the highlands.&#13;

The Rural Context'&#13;
A Diverse Agroecology and Population&#13;
1.    Total arable land in PNG is about 12.5 million ha (27 percent of total land area),&#13;
most of which is scattered over widely spread areas dissected by rugged topography.&#13;
However, only about 3 percent of arable lands (about 400,000 ha) are considered to have&#13;
high agricultural potential. The remaining arable lands, while generally suitable for&#13;
agriculture, have difficult topographic and bio-physical limitations and remain unused or&#13;
lightly used. Currently about 6.0 million ha are under cultivation (including land under&#13;
traditional bush fallow systems). Nearly 45 percent of the rural population live on&#13;
lowlands (altitude &lt;600 m), 7 percent on the mid-altitude/highland fringes (600-1,200 m),&#13;
and the remaining 48 percent on the highlands (altitude 1,200-2,800 m). The wide range&#13;
of agroecological conditions (elevations ranging from sea level to 2,800 m above sea&#13;
level, and rainfall from 1,000 mm to over 4,500 mm) make it possible to produce a wide&#13;
range of tropical, semi-tropical and temperate climate crops and livestock.&#13;
2.    Historically, PNG's rural population has grown at about 1.8 percent per annum,&#13;
with an end-1995 rural population at about 3.3 million. Apart from linguistic and ethnic&#13;
diversities (there are some 700 clans and tribes with multitudes of language groups), the&#13;
population is also culturally diverse, reflecting differing values and beliefs on virtually all&#13;
aspects of life (e.g., the role of women, bride price, compensation (pay-back) principles,&#13;
pig management, traditional exchanges, etc.) as well as differing levels of social and&#13;
economic development, reflecting their respective exposures to outside (western and&#13;
Asian) influences, and access to markets and social services. These agro-ecological and&#13;
socio-cultural diversities have given rise to extremely diverse farming systems.&#13;
A Traditional Land Tenure System&#13;
3.    Ownership of virtually all rural lands are vested in some 700 clans and tribal&#13;
groups under customary land tenure systems that are complex and impose rigidities on&#13;
free transfer, lease or use of land as collateral. Customary land rights are accorded by the&#13;
clans to the families and individual members of the clan. None of the customary lands&#13;
have been properly surveyed, demarcated and registered. Yet, most rural families have&#13;

Operations Division, Country Dept. III, East Asia and Pacific Region, World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
access to land to produce annual and perennial crops for subsistence and for cash sales.&#13;
The traditional system has provided remarkable tenurial security, social stability and&#13;
equity. On the other hand, land mobilization for development purposes (large-scale&#13;
commercial agriculture, infrastructure development, etc.) and for voluntary relocation of&#13;
rural population is complicated under the system.&#13;
Women In The Rural Economy&#13;
4.    Women's labor input into agricultural activities varies considerably from region to&#13;
region. On an average, women provide between 45-70 percent of agricultural labor and&#13;
produce food, tree and horticultural crops; market surplus food crops, poultry and marine&#13;
catch; and rear small livestock and poultry. Contrary to popular belief that women work&#13;
primarily on food gardens, they provide between 40-50 percent of total workdays for&#13;
smallholder coffee and cocoa, and 25-30 percent on copra and rubber. About 4045&#13;
percent of the catch-weight of fish and mollusks are also believed to be contributed by&#13;
women. Given this role of women in agriculture, it is imperative that delivery of public&#13;
sector agricultural support services are geared to ensure their full participation and&#13;
coverage.&#13;
Rural Infrastructure and Produce Marketing&#13;
5.    PNG compares favorably with other developing countries in terms of meters of&#13;
road per square kilometer and meters of road per person. But, more than 85 percent of&#13;
main roads and most feeder roads are earth-surfaced, poorly maintained, and&#13;
inaccessible/impassable during and after rains. All-weather road links are also often&#13;
disrupted because of poor maintenance, particularly of the bridges and culverts. These,&#13;
together with the high capital and operating costs of transport equipment, and poor&#13;
integration among the different modes and nodes of the transportation network, have&#13;
resulted in high domestic costs of transportation, which have increased in real terms since&#13;
the 1980s.&#13;
An Impoverished Rural Population&#13;
6.    As a result of years of sluggish and uneven agriculture sector growth, rural per&#13;
capita income stands at only about US$300-350 equivalent, compared to an average&#13;
urban income of about US$3,500. Between 30 and 50 percent of rural children are&#13;
malnourished; average life expectancy is less than fifty years; infant mortality rates range&#13;
from 50-110 deaths per 1,000 live births; and nearly 75 percent of the rural population&#13;
has no formal schooling. There is a high incidence of malnutrition among children, and&#13;
pregnant and lactating women; emerging pockets of severe malnutrition in the remote&#13;
areas; and prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) among most of the rural&#13;
population, because diets consist mostly of starchy roots.&#13;
7.     Clearly, the key social indicators, standard of living and incomes of the vast&#13;
majority of PNG's population resemble those of low income poor countries, and not of a&#13;
middle income country with a per capita income of about US$1,100, which PNG is by&#13;
statistical average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
8.    The economic development of PNG has been characterized by the emergence of a&#13;
small modem (enclave) sector, based on mineral resources extraction, commercial&#13;
logging operations and tree crop plantations, which co-exist with a vast traditional rural&#13;
sector consisting of subsistence and semi-subsistence agricultural producers.&#13;
9.    Agriculture provides income, employment and livelihood for over 85 percent of&#13;
PNG's population, and contributed 27 percent to PNG's gross domestic product (GDP),&#13;
35 percent to its export revenues and about 40 percent to the formal private sector&#13;
employment during 1980-90. Its importance is likely to remain undiminished during the&#13;
coming years, and may even increase, given the likelihood of the mineral and oil sector&#13;
resources tapering off by the turn of the century. This will require a move towards&#13;
institutional andfiscal reforms to improve the delivery of services in the rural areas. The&#13;
projectedfavorable world market prices for PNG's major export crops, provide a window&#13;
of opportunity to lay the foundation for growth during the next few years.&#13;
10.   Agricultural development in PNG faces formidable constraints:&#13;
a geographic location and topography (long distances to export markets; close&#13;
proximity to other long-established producers of many of the tradable&#13;
produced in PNG; rugged terrain and widely scattered arable lands);&#13;
. demographic peculiarities (widely dispersed population centers with&#13;
linguistic, cultural and ethnic diversities);&#13;
*  small, spatiallyfragmented, andpoorly integrated domestic markets;&#13;
&#149; cultural and institutional rigidities in the land and labor markets; and&#13;
* poor rural infrastructure and communication facilities.&#13;
11.   These physical and socio-cultural difficulties represent an extraordinary set of&#13;
impediments to monetization of subsistence and semi-subsistence farmers, integration&#13;
into the domestic economy, and modernization and commercial development of&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
12.   Organizational responsibilities for delivering smallholder agricultural support&#13;
services are spread across a large number of public sector institutions, including national&#13;
and provincial departmnents of the Government, parastatals, statutory boards, and publicly&#13;
owned commercial companies. There is no comprehensive national policy setting out the&#13;
objectives and priorities for delivering agricultural support services, guidelines for&#13;
operational and technical linkages between them, and a mechanism for coordinating&#13;
among this diverse set of institutions. There is very little, if any, interaction between the&#13;
public sector entities and the small but potentially important private sector comprising&#13;
companies, church-based development services, and individuals offering extension and&#13;
other advisory services to smallholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27 -&#13;
13.   Key aspects of a Rural Action Plan relevant to the proposed project include:&#13;
(a)   Rural Infrastructure Development:   substantially  increase public&#13;
investments to support the provincial and district authorities to expand, improve and&#13;
maintain:&#13;
* rural transport systems (construction and maintenance of farm-to-market and&#13;
feeder roads, local wharves, jetties, etc.); and&#13;
* physical infrastructure in primary and secondary markets.&#13;
(b)   Decentralized Local Development: public investments to create Local&#13;
Development Funds at the provinces to support:&#13;
* participatory and community-based local development initiatives, such as&#13;
construction of small village infrastructure, post-harvest handling facilities,&#13;
pasture improvements, social forestry plantations, establishing village&#13;
seed/seedling nurseries, etc.&#13;
a consolidation and expansion of a number of potentially worthwhile&#13;
smallholder development initiatives by the DAL and some Provincial&#13;
Departments.&#13;
(c)   Improve Effectiveness of Agricultural Support Services:&#13;
* public sector support services should focus on smallholders, balanced&#13;
development of the sub-sectors of agriculture, and sustainable natural resource&#13;
management;&#13;
* the National Agricultural Research institute (NARI) should be developed;&#13;
* ongoing efforts to decentralize delivery agricultural support services to front-&#13;
line (provincial and district) agencies should be strengthened, and better&#13;
focused on smallholders;&#13;
* operational linkages between public and private agencies should be&#13;
strengthened, and increased private sector delivery of agricultural support&#13;
services fostered.&#13;

Economic Setting&#13;
1.    PNG is endowed with a rich natural resource base, including major gold and&#13;
copper deposits, large oil and natural gas reserves, extensive forests and maritime&#13;
fisheries. Although PNG is classified as a middle-income country (per capita income&#13;
approximately US$1,100 p.a.), it has a dualistic economy in which capital-intensive&#13;
enclave oil, mineral, and forestry sectors dominate, but about 85 percent of the population&#13;
derive their livelihood from agriculture, mainly low-productivity, labor-intensive farming&#13;
and tree crops, and have barely been affected by developments in the rest of the economy.&#13;
Economic growth has been uneven over the past two decades, driven by fluctuations in&#13;
primary exports.&#13;
2.    Public expenditure levels in the recent past have been high, especially on public&#13;
sector wages and salaries. At the same time, social and physical capital has been&#13;
seriously neglected. Not only has public expenditure been directed away from capital&#13;
investment but, within recurrent expenditure, allocations to preserve valuable assets (i.e.,&#13;
maintenance) have decreased. This neglect has been acute for basic rural infrastructure,&#13;
e.g. road maintenance. The result - poor road conditions that increase internal transport&#13;
costs, reduce international competitiveness and viable exports, increase demand for&#13;
foreign exchange, curtail domestic income, and weaken accessibility to domestic markets&#13;
and services.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.    The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was endorsed by the&#13;
Bank's Board in August 1995, called for Bank assistance to PNG to support Goverrnent&#13;
policies designed to:  (a) maintain macro-economic stability and restore growth;&#13;
(b) restore business confidence and enhance competitiveness in the private sector and&#13;
improve the sustainability of natural resources management; and (c) improve the delivery&#13;
of services through restructuring of public expenditures, with an emphasis on basic&#13;
services and increasing public investment. A revised CAS is currently under preparation,&#13;
which adds special emphasis to: improving response time to natural disasters; promoting&#13;
sustainable and broad-based economic growth using the rural population's most abundant&#13;
asset, labor; introducing targeted programs to increase rural incomes, inter alia, through&#13;
job creation; broadening modes of service delivery by enhancing partnerships with&#13;
churches, NGOs, CBOs and in the process, harnessing the capacity of women and youth&#13;
groups to deliver basic services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.   In support of these objectives, the Bank has taken a leadership role in shaping an&#13;
Economic Recovery Program supported by all key donors and for which a Structural&#13;
Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3934-PNG) was implemented in 1996. The Government has&#13;
succeeded in broadly stabilizing the economy and has made good progress in upgrading&#13;
public expenditure management. Incentives for private investment have been streamlined&#13;
and transparency enhanced, resulting in increased private activity, particularly in non-&#13;
mining and manufacturing.  Continued progress will depend critically on macro-&#13;
economic management and structural reforms, a more effective response by the non-&#13;
mining private sector, improved public service delivery and project implementation and&#13;
commitment to sustainable natural resources management, particularly in forestry.&#13;
Estimated Declines in Agricultural Revenue due to the Drought&#13;
5.    The Rural Industries Cotmcil (RIC) estimate of total revenue losses for the key&#13;
agricultural industries due to the drought (if it continued into early 1998) at K164 million&#13;
(about 25 percent of 1997 forecasts). In summary, the estimates were as follows for 1997&#13;
actuals and 1998 predictions respectively; coffee (K70 million and K75 million); cocoa&#13;
(K38 million and K36 million); copra (K1O million and K14 million); sugar&#13;
(K5.2 million and K 6.6 million); rubber (K4 million and K3 million). Oil Palm and tea&#13;
revenue decline estimates for 1998 were Kl9 million and KI0 million, respectively.&#13;

Background&#13;
1.    The National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI)' is working closely with the&#13;
Agricultural Research Division (ARD) of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock&#13;
(DAL) in organizing the multiplication of planting materials of the major staple food&#13;
crops, for distribution to the farmers in the drought/frost affected areas. Sufficient&#13;
planting materials should be made available for distribution to farmers at the onset of rain&#13;
or when the situation returns to normal. In the meantime, high priority needs to be given&#13;
to the selection of drought and frost resistance or tolerant varieties from the National&#13;
Germplasm Collections. These varieties will be multiplied and distributed to farners&#13;
before the other planting materials. This would be a short- to medium-term approach in&#13;
order to address the current food production problem. However, it is also important to&#13;
look at medium- to long-term strategies that address issues of sustainable food crop&#13;
production in PNG (food security via diversification of varieties). In addition, soil and&#13;
water management and conservation are important areas for investigation, as is&#13;
supplementary irrigation.&#13;
A.    Food  Crops:   Selection, Multiplication, Distribution  of Drought/Frost&#13;
Resistant Varieties&#13;
2.    Activities: The major staple crops in PNG are sweet potato, sago, taro, banana,&#13;
cassava and yam. The important and popular leafy vegetable is aibika. Sufficient&#13;
varieties or landraces of these crop species are maintained in field collections at various&#13;
Agricultural Research Stations around the country. The purpose of this study is to screen&#13;
these collections and select varieties with resistance or tolerance to drought or frost. The&#13;
selected varieties would then be multiplied and distributed to farmers for planting and&#13;
extension centers and NGOs for further multiplication for farmers.&#13;
3.    Another important aspect of the study are field collections in areas that are badly&#13;
hit by drought and frost to collect varieties that have survived and show some resistance&#13;
to the harsh conditions. These genetic materials would then be multiplied and distributed&#13;
to farmers in other similar areas.&#13;

management research with specific focus on water conservation technologies for the dry&#13;
regions of the country. However, currently there is no effective research in this area&#13;
because of inadequate trained scientists. Other related problems include lack of detail&#13;
agro-climate data on which prediction of water use efficiency and crop yield&#13;
performances can be made.&#13;
9.    Objective. In order to initiate a medium- to long-term research program on water&#13;
conservation for the dry regions, it will be necessary to:&#13;
*  design and develop a research program on land and water conservation with&#13;
specific focus on dry lowlands;&#13;
*   adapt and develop water retention and harvesting techniques for smallholder&#13;
farmers;&#13;
* assess the effectiveness and durability of small-scale irrigation equipment at&#13;
the farm level in conjunction with NGO-sponsored trials (e.g. in the&#13;
Markham Valley with the Adventist Development Relief Agency and in the&#13;
Western Highlands with the Fresh Produce Development Co. Pty Ltd.); and,&#13;
* investigate sources of simple and appropriate irrigation equipment for&#13;
adaption to the specific conditions in PNG with the view to having local&#13;
artisans make and maintain these equipment in country. Coordination with&#13;
NGOs would be essential.&#13;
10.   Activities.  The following activities would be carried out in appropriate dry&#13;
lowland areas and also in the Bena Bena Valley which is badly affected by the drought:&#13;
* recruit an expert with background in soil water conservation research to&#13;
design, develop and start-up a fully costed 3-5 year program (draft terms of&#13;
reference in Appendix);&#13;
* recruit a junior scientist to work with the program leader;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
*  review recent literature on water harvesting and water retention technologies&#13;
in order to select appropriate technology for adaption at farm level;&#13;
*  purchase directly or get donor support to import equipment; thereafter assess&#13;
effectiveness of irrigation equipment vis-A-vis wateruse efficiency by crops;&#13;
*  procure the basic equipment necessary to collect, analyze and monitor trends&#13;
in climatic parameters such as temperatures, wind speed, solar radiation,&#13;
relative humidity and soil moisture monitoring at 10 specific field sites.&#13;

The Needfor Water Research&#13;
The recent complex changes in the water patterns associated with the El Nino/&#13;
southern Oscillation weather perturbations has highlighted one important deficiency in&#13;
the country's capacity to harness and manage limited water resources available,&#13;
particularly to people in the dry areas of the country. This need has emerged an&#13;
opportunity for the National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) to conduct&#13;
appropriate research into sustainable land-crop-water management with specific focus on&#13;
water management. One of the aims of the Institute is to generate, adapt and promote the&#13;
use of appropriate and improved agricultural technologies to maintain and enhance the&#13;
farmer's capability for sustainable management of his resources including land and water.&#13;
The Water Management Specialist&#13;
Since the Institute lacks the specific expertise for such work, a Crop-Water&#13;
Management Specialist (CWMS) is required. The ideal candidate would be an agro-&#13;
physiologist or an agricultural engineer with extensive practical experience in irrigation&#13;
and crop-water management, preferably in a semi-arid region. He should also possess&#13;
skills in crop-water use modeling, a tool which will be useful in planning.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
Consistent with and in conformity with the Institute's overall research agenda for&#13;
soil and water management, the CWMS will be required to plan, initiate and undertake&#13;
specific activities to meet the following objectives:&#13;
* develop a medium- to long-term NARI research programme for water&#13;
conservation and management for the dry regions of the country;&#13;
*  design and develop a program for soil and water conservation research with&#13;
specific focus on the dry lowland and highland areas;&#13;
*  develop a strategy for water harvesting, retention and conservation techniques&#13;
using simple and readily available materials for smallholder farmers. An&#13;
adjunct to this activity will include investigations and identification of simple&#13;
and appropriate irrigation equipment for adaptation to the specific conditions&#13;
Drafted by NARI during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35 -&#13;
in PNG with the view to having local artisans make and maintain these&#13;
equipments in-country;&#13;
* develop appropriate research tools for crop-water use modeling, soil-organic&#13;
matter management for water and nutrient conservation;&#13;
* develop standard criteria to assess and test the effectiveness and durability of&#13;
small-scale irrigation equipment at the farm level in conjunction with NGOs,&#13;
AusAID irrigation and water specialists and other organizations such as&#13;
mission (e.g. SDA), and development institutions such as FPDC.&#13;

Procurement, Disbursement, Special Account, Accounts andAudit&#13;
A.   Procurement&#13;
1.    Water Supply. Goods and equipment will be procured through international and&#13;
national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. Works under the water supply&#13;
program would not be financed under the Loan and would be procured under existing&#13;
arrangements between the local governments and beneficiaries.&#13;
2.    Rural Works Program.  This portion of the loan would reimburse the&#13;
Government for the cost of labor paid to qualified beneficiaries of this community&#13;
program upon submission of acceptable output completion certificates, and for materials&#13;
provided through local prudent shopping procedures.&#13;
(a)   For procurement of small routine maintenance works.  Direct&#13;
contracting with a village group, rather than with individual villagers,&#13;
based on community participation procedures acceptable to the Bank, for&#13;
vegetation control, drains and culvert cleaning and simple maintenance of&#13;
the road sections fronting their respective villages, schools, health posts&#13;
and hospitals. Village level contracts are labor intensive with both men&#13;
and women participating, in the range of US$3,000-13,000 per year and&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million under the proposed project.&#13;
(b)   Goods/equipment. Goods and equipment will be procured through&#13;
international and national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.    Consultants. The PCFU Manager and Water Management Research Scientist&#13;
will be selected in accordance with paras. 5.1-5.3, and consultant services under the rural&#13;
water supply program will be selected in accordance with paras. 3.1 or 5.1-5.3 of the&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers," dated January 1997 and revised September 1997.&#13;
4.    Prior review by the Bank will include the following:&#13;
(a)   the first five contracts for rural works to be procured under&#13;
community procedures in each province; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -&#13;
(b)   each contract for the employment of individual consultant services&#13;
to be awarded in accordance with paras. 5.1-5.3, and each contract for the&#13;
employment of consultant services to be awarded in accordance with&#13;
para. 3.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
B. Disbursements&#13;
4.    The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed on the following basis:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works: 80% of rural works.&#13;
(b)   Goods and Equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures for directly&#13;
imported items; 100% of ex-factory costs; and 90% of local expenditures&#13;
for other locally procured items.&#13;
(c)   Consultants, Technical Supervision and Training:  100%  of&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
(d)   Incremental Operating Expenses: 100% of incremental operating&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
5.    Disbursements under the project will be made against full documentation of&#13;
expenditures, except for the following items for which disbursement from the Special&#13;
Account would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs): (a) civil&#13;
works contracts under the rural works; (b) contracts for supply of goods; and&#13;
(c) incremental operational costs. SOE records would be made available for inspection to&#13;
Bank staff, as required during supervision.&#13;
6.    The project has been designed for implementation in 2 1/2 years and the loan can&#13;
be expected to be fully disbursed in 3 years.&#13;
C. SpecialAccount&#13;
7.   In order to expedite and facilitate disbursements, a Special Account (SA) with an&#13;
initial deposit of US$0.5 million equivalent (equivalent to maximum projected&#13;
disbursements within a 3-month period), would be established in the Papua New Guinea&#13;
Banking Corporation in Kina.&#13;
8.    The Ministry of Finance would submit replenishment applications for the Special&#13;
Account on a monthly basis, or whenever 20% of the authorized allocation has been used,&#13;
whichever occurs first. The replenishment applications will be supported by the&#13;
necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
bank statement of the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account would follow Bank procedures.&#13;
D. Accounts andAudits&#13;
9.    The Project Coordination and Facilitation Unit (PCFU) will have overall&#13;
responsibility for establishing, maintaining and monitoring a project accounting system&#13;
similar to that operating under the ongoing Gazelle Restoration Program that has been&#13;
reviewed by the Bank as satisfactory. Participating provincial governments will maintain&#13;
individual project accounts relating to their operations under the project. The PCFU will&#13;
act on GoPNG's behalf in maintaining consolidated project accounts for quarterly&#13;
monitoring and for preparation of annual financial project accounts for audit purposes.&#13;
Both provincial and consolidated accounts will be audited. The responsible staff member&#13;
in the PCFU will be trained on Bank procurement and disbursement policies and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
10.   The following agreements and understandings were reached at negotiations:&#13;
(a)   maintain satisfactory internal control arrangements including&#13;
documented procedures for authorizations, etc., procurement contract&#13;
management, and project financial management arrangements that are&#13;
based on appropriate accounting standards and reporting formats and will&#13;
include a project chart of accounts that classifies expenditures by project&#13;
component/activities, disbursement categories and sources of funds;&#13;
(b)   conduct annual audits of the project's accounts, including the&#13;
SOEs and the Special Account in a timely fashion by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; and,&#13;
(c)   submit to the Bank certified copies of the auditor's report on the&#13;
consolidated project accounts no later than six months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year to which it relates.&#13;
11.   The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review and&#13;
approval within six months of the end of the fiscal year. In the case of SOEs, the audit&#13;
report will contain a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs submitted during each fiscal&#13;
year, together with procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
12.   Project accounts and finauncial reporting would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
standards acceptable to the Bank. The PCFU would establish a control environment of&#13;
appropriate accounting and reporting systems according to the requirements of&#13;
OP/BP 10.02. A professional accountant (or a reputable accounting firm) will be hired to&#13;
set up and handle the accounting and financial management of the project.&#13;

1. Summnary&#13;
This report covcrs a second assessment (Phase 2) of the impact of a major drought&#13;
in Papua Ncw Guinea (}TNG). The Phase 2 assessment was carricd out between 25&#13;
Novemnber and 12 December 1997. A previous asscssment (Phase 1) was conducted&#13;
beTween 25 September and 1 1 October 1997. Thc Phase 2 assessment achieved a better&#13;
coverage of the country than the Phase 1 report The Pha-se 2 assessmert again used&#13;
populaion figures from the 1990 census, which is known to have been an under&#13;
cnumeraion of the actual population in 1990, sevcn years ago. No attempL has been made&#13;
in this report to adjust thcsc figurcs for under cnunieratiotn o gowth sixicz 1990.&#13;
Food&#13;
As predicted in thc;Phase 1 report, the numbers of people who now find&#13;
themsclvcs with no food olher than what they can collect from the bush around their&#13;
villages (Catcgory 5) has grown by a factzr of 2-5 to be around 260,000.&#13;
*ltLuoa who Lnvu utly  s*±ziill aal ixladequatc ailnuuitz of foud stil available from&#13;
gardens, sago, coconuts or fish (Category 4) has grown by more than 3 times to be an&#13;
estimated 980,000.&#13;
I?hus around 1.2 million people or 40 pcrccnt of an estimated 3.15 million rural&#13;
dwcllcrs in PNG are suffering a severe, and to some a life threatening, food shortage.&#13;
All provinces are affected to some degree. However, provinces with the largest&#13;
numbers of penple affected by a critical shortage of food (Category 5) are Western&#13;
(27,160), Milne Bay (26,200), Southem Highlands (28,300), Chimbu (54,720), Western&#13;
HI&amp;L;.ukd  (28.390) Th.steri Hioilaads (30,300), and Ccutrdl (21,170) (summary tables&#13;
and maps arc presented in Appendix 1).&#13;
EvCn with rcsonablc amounts of rain from now onwards, the numbers of people&#13;
without adequate food will continue to incre=se with fhe worst period yet to occur, around&#13;
February and March 1998. From April 1998 conditions will improve reasonably quickly,&#13;
so that by May 1998, probably only those people who live in the high altitude areas, will&#13;
remain with no Incal mean.s of slrpTort. Some: nFihbs prnpk. will he ahlr tn sippnrt&#13;
themselves in the places they have migraTcd to, the customary response to frosts.&#13;

Water&#13;
The Phase 2 asscssmcnt asscssed water supplX scparately. Il fh,ds 47,000 pcople&#13;
have only cxtremely limited amounTs of contaminated water for drinking and another&#13;
363,000 are carrying water of questionable quality ibr excessive distances. Despite rain,&#13;
local water sources have not yet recovered, but can be expcctcd to do so if rain continues.&#13;
Provinces with the largest numbers of people affecced by a cliti.al shortage of&#13;
drinking watxr (Category 5) are Milne Bay (20,200) and Fast Sepik (25,900). Other&#13;
provinces severcly affccted are Gulf, New Ireland and West New Britain.&#13;
Health&#13;
The Phase 2 assessment reccived many reports of pcople dying from what appears&#13;
to be the oomplioationu oftating 'bush' foods, in pmticulzr bush leaves, ik,nc UIG l vt; uf&#13;
almost anything else. The ihcidence of cases of severe malaria appears to have increased&#13;
in at least thrc provinces. However, dcspire many reports of diarrhoea caused by eating&#13;
bush food, an epidemic of dysenicric disease which might have been expected from the&#13;
drinking of polluted wuater has not occurred.&#13;
Rehabilitation&#13;
Tle sooner people can rcplant, the sooner they will be able to support themsclves.&#13;
Whilc rain has brought about a major effort in replwiting in soume parLs urPNG, in many&#13;
places therc rcmains a crtical lack of planting material. The Departmcnt of Agriculture&#13;
and Livestock, with AusAID assistance, obtaincd 17 tonnes of irish potato sccd from&#13;
Australia and distributed them to highlands provinces in November 1997. The Austalian&#13;
Government has announced an agricultural rehabilitation project which will ship over 400&#13;
tonnes of seed potato and 14 tonnes of com seed to PNG as soon as possiblc.&#13;
Accessibility&#13;
An attcmpt has bccn mrade to investigatc the acczibility vf *- ,us Llivisions&#13;
includcd in the drought impact asscssmcut. None of the 21,225 pc, svia iiu arcus uf&#13;
Category 5 food and watcr supply are accessible by road; 2,920 are accessible by sea&#13;
transport only (or helicopters capable oFlong over water flights or ship based&#13;
helicopters); 13,250 arc accessible by fixed wing aircrafh or a combination of fixed wing&#13;
aircraft and helicoptcrs flying from the fixed wing airstrip.&#13;
Of the 45,100 persons in areas of Category S fuud supply and CatLgory 4 water&#13;
supply, 12,460 arr, arnrsvisihir. hy .sirfiai nmral road. Those acccssible only by some&#13;
combination of fixed wing aircraft and helicoptcr number 25,390.&#13;
Anothcr way of approaching the problem of accessibility is to look at the numbcrs&#13;
ol people living in all census divisions falling into categories 5 and 4 for food supply.&#13;
FiRy-six pcr cent, (149,970 of Ihe 263,000 pcrsons in food supply Category 5) and 52&#13;
percent (517,220) of those in category 4, arc accessible by road, but of those, 8 and 12&#13;
percent respecdvely are accessible by dirt road only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Around 27 percent (71,760) of Category 5 populations are accessiblc only by&#13;
fixed wing aircraft, helicopter or somc combination of both and only 14 percnt&#13;
(1 32,592) of Category 4 populations.&#13;
T he balance of catcgory 5 populations (41,680) and Category 4 populations&#13;
(326,750) are accessiblc by river, by sea, or by some combination of road, river, sea and&#13;
air transport&#13;
Differences in accessibility between provinces suggests that an across-the-board&#13;
rate for transport calculated as a percentagc of the purchase cost of the food aid, applicd&#13;
equally to all provinces in the country, is not an appropriate way of calculating the&#13;
transport costs of delivering food aid.&#13;
2, Frost and DrouLghfin Papiia Ncw   iunint'a&#13;
A drought, probably the, most seyere in the last I Q years, cnntinues To impact&#13;
upon food and water supply in PNG. The drought is associated with a major El Niio-&#13;
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in the Pacific. Clear night skies associated with this&#13;
cveni caused repeated frosts in many areas above 2,200 m above sea level from May until&#13;
NoYCv htr 1997 The: drninghl Ihr.gn in many parts of PNG =round April and May 1997.&#13;
It rcduccd food and water supplics in different parts of the country in different ways.&#13;
About 1 million people in the lowlands eat sago as a staple. Sago is manufactured&#13;
from a 10 to 15 ycar old palm, by pounding the pith of the palm into fine chips. The chips&#13;
are soaked in water to leach out the sago starch. As a result of the drought local water&#13;
sources used to makc sago dried up. In addition the starch content of the palms is said to&#13;
have been reduced. Many people have been forced to scatter to placcs distant from their&#13;
villages where enough water is available. Siomc sago stands have bccn damaged by fire.&#13;
With rain, the problem of waLer for sago making will be sharply reduced.&#13;
Tn many coastal areas coconuts providc a supplementry food, a source of&#13;
drinking water and as copra, a source of cash with which to buy food such as rice. In the&#13;
most severely droughted areas, coconuts have either stopped producing or are producing&#13;
at much reduced levcls. Pull production will not be restored for up to 2 years afler normal&#13;
rainfall paterns arc resumned&#13;
In the lowlands production from gardens planted in late-1996 and carly- 1997 was&#13;
reduced by as much as 80 perccnt in many areas. Aficr the much reduced 1997&#13;
production from these gardens had bccn consumed, villagers were Forced to fall back&#13;
upon coconuts, sago and so-called 'famine' foods, uncultivatcd tubers, seeds and leaves,&#13;
gathered in forest fllows surrounding the gardens. Food production in these areas will&#13;
noL recover until gardens planted in latc- 1997 begin to yield in 1998. fn many areas, a&#13;
considerable proportion of planting stocks were lost in the droughted 1997 gardens&#13;
(planLing materials are trarnsferred from old garden to new gardcn every year). In coastal&#13;
areas in the eastern part of PNG, carly in the new year a number ot important nut bearing&#13;
trets should come into production and provide an imnportant supplcmentary rood sourcc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
In thc highlands, betwccn 1400 metres and 1800 metres above sea level, whcre 40&#13;
percent of The population livc, food production from gardens is commonly continuous,&#13;
with planting occuring throughout the year. The most important crop is sweet potato.&#13;
Swcet pQatto produccs cdible tuhers in aholt 6 months at around 1500 m above sea level,&#13;
but first harvest takes up to 8 months at 2500 m. Thus food being harvested at any&#13;
particular timc was planted between 6 and 12 months ago. The drought caused sweet&#13;
pAlatn to censc production, and killed nov plantingL. Peoplu grudually consumcd tubers&#13;
that were mature or near mature when the drought began, and many were within a lew&#13;
weeks of having no more food lcft in their gardens at thc lime of the Phase 1 assessment&#13;
In the high altitude areas, above 2200 m, repeated frosts killed most sweet potato&#13;
top growth and any replanting that was attempted. (.Areas as low as 1400m expericnced at&#13;
least one frost during 1997? amost unusual occurrence). At the time of the Phase I&#13;
assessment, people in the fr4sted arcas had either run out of food from gardens or were&#13;
consuming the last Lubes from gardens planted prior to the frosts.&#13;
Thc pandanus nut, an important seasonal food source in the highlands, is coming&#13;
into production now. In many locations produrtion is said to be very poor a.s a re-slli nf&#13;
the drought. Fires have also damaged stands of pandanus. Many peopie statc they are&#13;
eating the centre of the nut bcaring part of the plant as a famine food.&#13;
MxIy parts of PNG roocived rain during Deccmber, and as a r6sult a gocat dca.l uf&#13;
garden replanting is presently underway. 14lowever, even if rain sufficient to satisfactorily&#13;
mnaintain the newly planted gaTdens continues to lall (see Appendix 3). lood supplics will&#13;
not return to adequate lcvels until April or latcr in many areas. Whcrc planting stocks&#13;
have bccn lost, the rate at which food supplies recovcr in areas will depend to some&#13;
extent on thc rate at which planting materials such as sweet potato vines, Irish potato,&#13;
maizc and bean seeds can be supplied. Irish potato will produce edible tubcrs within 100&#13;
days In most highlands areas, compared to 1 ?SU to 2Uu days lor sweet potato.&#13;
3. Methods of Assessment&#13;
The Phase 2 asscssment was undertakcn by 18 tcamns comprising a Icader and one&#13;
or two members (Appcndix 2). Telm 1cdeaza W  i. az;b1eJ it) di/Tlrcnt pruvin=:s f*n&#13;
thome in which they worked in tho Phano I use3ncnt in order to providz asex cn,&#13;
independent vicw of the impact of the drought and frosts on food, water and hcalth&#13;
couditions.&#13;
A two day workshup was organiscd at the Malalo Resort HoEel north of Madang&#13;
ror team leaders on 26 and 27 November. The workshop was chaired by the Director of&#13;
Research for the Department of Agriculture and T.ivestock, Mr B. Wayi. It was attcnded&#13;
by representativcs from Red Cross P14G, CARE Australia and Community Aid&#13;
Abroad/Oxfarn, who provided valuable comparative experiences from asscsSmcnts in&#13;
other parts of the world. The workshop wws addressed by Mr Peter Barter on the national&#13;
and intermational coordination and management of the rclief program and fund raising.&#13;
This proved to bc very useful, becausc duTing the Phasc I assessment teams had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
asked rcpcatedly by provincial authorities what form of narional coordination was in&#13;
place.&#13;
The wOrTkhop critically examined the first assessment. The major points covered&#13;
in this discussion included how to work with provincial government officials; the&#13;
importance of consultation with provincial health and water supply workers; the need to&#13;
make diTect observations of food and water supply situations; the nced to verify local&#13;
assessmnents; logistical problems; the nccd to carefully plan thc use of fixed wing aircrafl&#13;
versus helicopters ror travel to isolatcd areas; how to deal with villagers angry about&#13;
receiving no belp from govcrnmcnt; and what to do in the case of huldups.&#13;
The second session of the workshop discutmued changes in the Phase 2 assessmcnt.&#13;
These included: the separation of drought impact ratings into food supply and water&#13;
supply assessments; thc nee(for a predicted rating for food and watcr supply in two&#13;
months Limc and the problem associated with doing this; the reasons why the new&#13;
Council Wards and Electorates could not be used as a basis for the assessment (no maps&#13;
nor census information at the national Icvel); rnethods that could be used lo achieve a&#13;
provincial coverage; the need for provincial auLhoities to participate in the assessmcnt&#13;
and to agrcc with the ratings given to Census Divisions within the Province.&#13;
The third session of the work.shop was uscd to allocate teams to provinces, to pay&#13;
cash advances and to allow team leaders to brief each other on the previous asscssments&#13;
of particular provinces.&#13;
Notes und in the workshop =rc presenmed in Appendix 4.&#13;

* lhe introduction of an additional category 'f' for areas receiving food aid. This&#13;
category proved impractical in use and has not. been taken into account further in&#13;
the asscssment&#13;

Coverage&#13;
The Phase 2 assessmcnrt achieved a better coverage than Lhe Phase I assessment.&#13;
Of the 3.15 million peoplc ccnsuscd in 1990 and living in rural PN,T, the Phase 1&#13;
assessmenm had no information from areas in which 1.33 million lived. Jn comparison, the&#13;
Phase 2 assessrnent lacks infornation from an arca where only 107,000 persons live.&#13;
Most of these people are located in thc lowlands of West Sepik, because the Phase 2&#13;
assessment team assigncd to this province was unable io get into the field. The high&#13;
altitude parts of the West Sepik Province were covered from Wester Province.&#13;
Information from the teams working in Morobe Province, except for that from the&#13;
Huon Peninsula has not been received at the time of wviting. The Iluon Peninsula was not&#13;
assessed in Phase 1, but the-Phase I assessment of the rest of the province was&#13;
comprehensive. The PhaseW2,Aorohe asses.sment is hased on the Phase 1 reports and&#13;
knowledgc of the province agricultural systems. It will be adjusted when the Phase 2&#13;
reports are received.&#13;
4. Findings&#13;
Food&#13;
As predicted in the Phase 1 report, the numbers of people who have noved into a&#13;
situation of having no food availablc from gardens, and who, are surviving on a wide&#13;
variety of 'famine' foods. increased substantially bctwccn the two asscssments. Almost&#13;
1.24 million people. or 40 percent of a rural population of 3.15 mil1ion survcycd, now&#13;
either have no food from gardens or have only very small amounts of garden food&#13;
available (See tables and maps, Appendix 1).&#13;
From 98,000 people judged to be in Category 5 in the Phase I assessment, the&#13;
Phnsc 2 assessment incrcascd by 163,300 pcrsons, or 2.5 timcs to 261,300. Catcgory 4&#13;
numb=s more Than trebled from 292,000 in October to 978.000 in December.&#13;
Provinces conwibuding most to the Increase In Category 5 nunbers were western&#13;
(14,400), Minc Bay (21,790), Southcrn Highlands (1 5,400), Western Highlands&#13;
(28.900), Chimbu (54,721) and Eastan Highlands (30,300). Tn F.nga Province, the&#13;
numbcrs in catcgory 5 fe1l by 9,150 people.&#13;
Thece 261,000 people, other thnn approximatoly 60,000 in Weetorn, Contrel, Weut&#13;
Scpikc Gulf and Milnc Bay who have been provided with relief supplics by AusAID and&#13;
the PJlNGDl/ADF, have been eating a wide range of-bush leaves, the heart of various&#13;
palms including pandanus and black palm, 'wild' yams, boiled unripe eating banana,&#13;
boiled taro lenvoo and taro ctozna.&#13;
The largest incrcascs in Category 4 occurred in Morobe (1 19,000), where the&#13;
Phase I assessment was not carried out on the HAuon Peninsula, and in Fastem Highlands&#13;
(120,000), Chimbu (121,000).&#13;
Category 4 areas still have very small hut inadequate amounts of food availablc&#13;
from gardcns, mainly sweeL potaLo, tanan   4 "&gt;@yp, p)qqndi1ng on thqjr 1QVglgQf&#13;

thcy may also be eating 'famine' foods, or sago, coconuts, or fish or with small amounts&#13;
of rice purchased from savings or cash eamed in widc varicty of ways. None of these&#13;
foods are suficient to providt adtequaLe normal nutritional requirements.&#13;
Water&#13;
The Phasc I asscssmcnt found at lcast 100,000 people were experiencing critical&#13;
problems with drinking water, but could not be more specific bccausc water supply and&#13;
food supply were assessed together (See tables and maps, Appendix 1).&#13;
'[be Phasc 2 assessment finds 47,000 people have only extremely limited amounts&#13;
of contaminated water for drinking and another 363,000 are carrying water of variabic&#13;
quality for cxcessive distances. Despite rain during November and December, most local&#13;
(and usual) sources of watet remainr d inadequate.&#13;
Approximately 67 percent of the population of Mine Bay (99,000) do not havc&#13;
acrcss to good drinking water. In Gulf Province more than half of the population (33,400)&#13;
is in a similar situations. Elscwhere, in New Ireland (35,000) and West New Britain&#13;
(32,000) l1-3cnufnbcrs of people do not have access to good quality drinking waler.&#13;
Drinking watcr is also in critically short supply in parts of Madang and East Sepik. Only&#13;
in Eastern Highlands, Westem iighlands and Bougainville can it bo said that thc&#13;
drinking water situation is acceptable.&#13;
If rain continues to be received, even in below average amounls, the drinking&#13;
water sinmaton will continuc to improve. Considerable improvment has coccurred in&#13;
Chimbu nd ;nga, with rain rccived rince in November and December. Many te2ms&#13;
predict that water supplies wiU improvc ovcr the next nwo months, provided rain&#13;
continues.&#13;
Food and Water&#13;
A limited number of areas are presently suffering from critical food shortages and&#13;
critical shortages of drinking water. AbouL 21,225 peopls-ere-4ocated in arcas which havc&#13;
bccn placed in Category 5 for food and drinking water. They are all in Milne Bay except&#13;
for 1.000 people in the West Sepik- (Table 1).&#13;

l he location of-these census divisions are shown on naps in Appendix 1.&#13;
Provinces will bc informcd dircctly of the location and numbers of people involved, but&#13;
given their prcscnt implmcntation difficultims, it is suggested that at least the 67,000 odd&#13;
people in thc critical cstegories of 5 for food and 4 or 5 for watcr bc monitorcd closcly by&#13;
a national or intmnational organisation.&#13;
Health&#13;
No antcmpt was madc to undcrtakc a formal survcy of hcalth. Ncvcrtheless it is&#13;
fair to suggest that in many parts of the country the physiological stress of lack of&#13;
adequate food is beginning to be expressed in increased sickness and deaths. The Phase 2&#13;
assessment team report more people dying of unexplained symptoms than the Phase I&#13;
tcams. There arc inreased reports of young to mid-agc adults dying, in comparison to a&#13;
normal pattcm of dcaths in which the vcry young and the vcry old prcdominatc. Most&#13;
health workers report an increase in the incidence of severe malaria.&#13;
On the other hand there does not appear to have been n substantial increase in&#13;
dysentcric diseswes. Many people, adults and children, are said to have diarrhoea caused&#13;
by eating 'bush' leaves, but there are no reports of large numbers of people suffering&#13;
diarrhoea or dysentery from drinking contaminated water.&#13;
Troubling rcports wer received of people suffering stomach pain and severe&#13;
vomiting, which sometimes progresses to the vomiting of blood and death. Village people&#13;
blamc the consumption of 'bush' leaves with no other food, and it is possible some&#13;
pcoplc arc suffcring a toxic reaction to 'faminc' foods, or thcy arc cxperimenting eating&#13;
parcs of wild plants with unfortunate results. In some places pcople say they have caten&#13;
all the bener known edible wild plants and are now trying some they know little about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Other reports that suggcst ihat nuLritonal stress is bcginning to be telt across the&#13;
lareer popii larinn arc thosc nf children and adults fainting as they go about their everyday&#13;
acTivities. Thosc who faint are said to recover afitr a rcst. Many children have been&#13;
withdrawn from those schools which are still opcn, because the Leachers ask the parcnts&#13;
to remove the children after they have fallcn frrm Lheir seats in a fiint. Women and older&#13;
men are said to be fainting after working without eating anything substantial for a number&#13;
of days.&#13;
Rehabilitation&#13;
Rain throughout the highlands has resulted in significant garden planting. A&#13;
similar but lcss widespread response to rain in Septcmber resulted in losses of everyting&#13;
planted, when follow up ramnr did not occur. Planting material continueo to be in vary&#13;
short supply in many areas,n particular in those areas frosted badly. Some pcople have&#13;
kept small amounts of planting matcrial alive by lhajid waL ri , and iL is this maitnal&#13;
which is being planted at present If this materal is lost because of lack of rain during&#13;
December and January, the lack of planting material will become critical ovcr a much&#13;
wider area than just the frost zones.&#13;
Migration&#13;
The larg,e movements of peoplc reported in lhe Phase 1 assessmcnt appears to&#13;
have, pnaknd DTring thr. Phas. 2 a.sr.se.nt thexe were many fewer reports of people&#13;
moving. It seems those who could move have moved already.&#13;
In contrast, the Phase 2 asscsmcnt finds many wage 6aL1,uh c   uUyy±l i1id&#13;

5. Accessibility&#13;
An artempt has been made to provide a crude measure of access to particular&#13;
cenas4 diyiSiQns, A4es ha bvc;n vIscd into seven transport types nther than walking&#13;
(three classes of road - highway, surfaccd rural road, unsurfaced rural road), rivcr, sea,&#13;
fixed wing aircraft and helicopter. Many census units in many census divisions can only&#13;
bc rcachcd by a combination of Irdnsport types.&#13;
The. tahlrn. whic.h fnolnw arr. nnt intended to indicate the 'best' or most co5t.&#13;
efEective way of gcting io a location. While in theory it is possible to reach all census&#13;
units by helicopter, the information in Table 5 lists the qhegpq5t folm of trasnpo  fut. It&#13;
also assunes thal '`reachin-" a census division means to get to within two to threc hours&#13;
walk from all census units within iL Thus the combination of 'River - Fixed wing&#13;
alrcra.f' Indicatcs that It Is possible to reach the census division by river Ltansport, but to&#13;
get to within 2 to 3 hours walk from all of the census units, a flxcd wing aircraft must&#13;
also be used. However, in such a casc, it may be cheaper and more efficicnt to just use the&#13;
aircratL )r in the case of a combination of 'Sca' and aiTcrft, to no)t use sea transport at&#13;
all. However River or 'Sea' or any form of transport listed alonc, indicatcs that that is&#13;
thc only means of reaching Lhe census division.&#13;

Another way of approaching this problem is to look at the accessiinlity of the&#13;
numbers of people living in all census divisions Ialling into categories 5 and 4 for food&#13;
supply (Table 7).&#13;
Fifty-six per cent, or 149,970 of the 263,000 pcisons in food supply Citegory 5&#13;
and 52 pcrcent (517,220) of those in category 4, are acccssible by road, but oF those, 8&#13;
and 12 percent respectively art: accessible by dir road only.&#13;

T1he balance of category 5 populations (41.680) and Category 4 populations&#13;
(326,750) are accessible by nrver, by sea, or by some combination of road, rivcr, sea and&#13;
air transporL-&#13;
A full analysis of accessibility by province is not presented here, but some&#13;
provinccs arc particularly disadvantaged. For example in Milne Bay, none of the 26,200&#13;
Category 5 population is acccssiblc by road and nor is a majority of the Category 4&#13;
populaluon. In othcr provinces the majority of the Catcgory 5 populations are accessible&#13;
by road, but a minority of people are not. ln the Eastern highlands for example, 20,700&#13;
Catcgory 5 pcrsons arc acccssiblc by road, but 9,600 or 30 pcrccnt are accessible only by&#13;
fixed wing aircraftL 'Ihe cost of transporting food aid to this 30 pcrccnt is several timcs&#13;
more than one-third orf.he total costs of transport.&#13;
'l'his sug-ests that an across-the-board rate for transport calculated as a perccntage&#13;
of the purchase cost of the food aid, applied equally to all provinces in the country is not&#13;
xi appropriatc way of czculmring thc trmspon costs.&#13;

villagers have started to plant food gardens again. This is not true everywhere - in some&#13;
placoo it is still too dny to plant and many pcoplk arc vcry w:ak- fi;... ]auk vEffvvd iuxd&#13;
discei5,K3 v    wiLlt d=- JiuuL Tlvugltuut nost or th Highlands, Ivfarosc and&#13;
Islands Regions, people are planring, but there is only vcry limited replanting in coastal&#13;
parts of Western Province, Gulf Province, Ccntral Province and parts of tainland Milne&#13;
Bay Province.&#13;
One of the most urgcnt needs now is to get planting materal of fast growing crops&#13;
to villagers. The seed that is needed most urgently is com (maize), English potato and&#13;
common bean. Com will gaw in aU environments in Papua New Guinea up to an&#13;
altitudc of about 2500 m; p6lato will do well at ovcr 1600 m (and as high as the limiLs of&#13;
agriculture at 2800 m); and beams will grow wcll abovc about 400 m altitude. Com and&#13;
potato will producc a crop in 90-100 days, dcpcnding on altitude. Beans can bc catcn 45-&#13;
60 days after planating. This is fister than staples such as sweet potato, taro and bananas.&#13;
For examplc, sweet potato tubers can bc harvested 4-6 months after planting, depending&#13;
on altitudc. Over 2,500rn as] sweet potato can be harvested only 9 to 12 months after&#13;
planting-&#13;
Provision of large quantitics orplantng, material of fast growing crops will&#13;
rapidly irnprove villagers' food supply and reduce the need for provision of expensive&#13;
and inefficient food aiL&#13;
The quantities of seed nceded are large - but they arc only a fraction of the food&#13;
presently being importcd Hito Papua New Guiun. Tou  rice imports for mrail sale alone&#13;
are currently about 5000 tonnes per week&#13;
An indication of the quantitics of seed required follows:&#13;
*  1000 Tonnes of seed potato will supply sbout 30 per cent of the calorie neood of&#13;
100,000 pcople for 100 days'&#13;
*  150 tonnes of corn seed will supply about 30 per enut of dir calorie nccd- of 100,000&#13;
people for 1 00 days2&#13;
Seed needs to be supplied to villagers only once as they can replant somc of the&#13;
material from the first planting.&#13;
There is one othcr issue with planting matcrial. Corn will only yield wcll whcrc&#13;
the soil is relatively fertile. tJsually in Papua New Guinea, corn is planted in gardens&#13;
cleared from fallow land or in fertile site only. Tro maximize the yield of corn and thus to&#13;
rclicve the curTrnt food supply crisis, it would he best if villagcrs fertilized cum with&#13;
organic or inorganic fertilizcr. Organic manure includes coffee pulp and animal waste,&#13;
applied at 10-20 tonnes/ha (1 -2kg/n9). The most suitable inorganic fertilizcr is urea&#13;
Th is is based on a multiplication ratc of 10 tonnes of warm potato for cvcry I tonne of seed potato.&#13;
2 Tnis is based on a planting rAte of 17 kg per ha and a yicld ol'4000 kg per ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
applied at 100 kg urea per ha (10 g/ m2 or 1 fish tin full pcr 40 in). ApplicaLion of&#13;
inorganic or organic fcrtlizcr is not usua] prdctice in Papua New Guinca Effective&#13;
extension campaigns arc nccded to convince villagers lo fertilize corn.&#13;

Drought Assessment Phase 2 Workshop Notes&#13;
The Form has been reduced to one page to make faxing easicr and to reduce the&#13;
amount of information that has to be dealt with in Port Moresby. Please fax the form aF&#13;
soon as possible afteryou have compLeted it. Do not wait urtlyo u have done the&#13;
whole provincial assessment&#13;
Fax numbers - In order to avoid the power outages in Port Moresby we art usinig&#13;
World Bank or UNDP faxes. Use 323 1526 (the World Bank office in the Islander) if you&#13;
can. Use 321 1224 in th4UNDP office if you cannot get through on the other number&#13;
after thre or four attempts. These machines should be operational 24 hours a day.&#13;
Names, Date, Phone Number - Your names, the date of your assessment, A&#13;
reliable contact number in case more information is needed.&#13;
Province, District, Census Division - These are the 1990 Census definitions. Do&#13;
not use new Wart or Local Govemment Area numbers. There are no officia definitions of&#13;
them, nor any maps showing where they are located. You have been given a map of the&#13;
1990 Census Divisions, with their codes. Please use them. If you don't know the Distaid&#13;
code it does not matter. People who are entering your informanon mto the co:puter will&#13;
know where your information refers to, only if you use the province and census divisions&#13;
codes and names&#13;
Please print lgibly. Use simple English. Your form has to come through a fAx&#13;
machine and still be to be read and understood by others.&#13;
The Assessment&#13;
It is possible some village people will be annoyed at having received no help from&#13;
the gOvernmenL. Explain to them that you are not responsible for providing help to theax.&#13;
Do not promise assistance. You can promise people that their information aDout the&#13;
situation in their area Will be reported directly to Port Moresby and to the provincial&#13;
headquarters. Stress that you need to see for yourself that what they are saying is tue. Bf&#13;
compassionately scepticaL&#13;
Try and get a represenrative from the provincial Drought Relief Coordination&#13;
Office to come with you in the province and to participate in the assessment It is&#13;
iuportanlt that lle povinces accept Lhe fidings of dhe aSses t. If tEheir ltpreseiltAt'VS&#13;
participate in thc &amp;ssczsment they will bs more likely to accept the findings.&#13;
The assessment is at a Census Division scale. In the case of large Census Divisions&#13;
this will present some problems, but you will have to ty and deal with them as best ypu&#13;
can in the notes. Whert you believe one part of a Division is clearly different to another&#13;
part, flag this clearly in the notes and enter the Categories for the worst part in the&#13;
Category boxes.&#13;
As you travel about in a Census Division take notes in a notebook about patddtiti&#13;
places, villages or census units. Use the notes about all these places in your notebook to&#13;
draft a summary for the whole CD. Finally fill out the fornm and send it in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76 -&#13;
You will not be able to go to every Census Division in a province, but you may&#13;
still be able to report on then.L Use the map and the knowledge of local administrators to&#13;
determine which ones you should visit, which you need not visit, and which can be&#13;
estimated from other information available. E.g. if a number of reports say there an no&#13;
problems in an area, then use the form to report that information and state clearly that you&#13;
have not been there.&#13;
-oooOooo-&#13;
Food Supply Category. this is the l to 5 (there is now a 6') rating of the severity&#13;
of the drought and frost impacts -(see box-below). You are asked to make an two&#13;
assessments 'Now' (asIi 1 Deceber 1997) and in 2 months time- (as at 1 February&#13;
1998). The second assessment will be based on trends in food supply that you can&#13;
observe. If you cannot comfortably make a prediction with the information available to&#13;
you. entcr a 'O' in this box. Use the guidelnes over the page in the bOA o lIelp yuu assirn&#13;
a Category to a Census Division. Do not refer to the rating given in the first assessmenL&#13;
Do this assessment independently from the first one.&#13;
Food Supply Categories.&#13;
1. Unusually dry, but no real food supply problems.&#13;
2. Some inconvenience. Staple food is short but other food is available&#13;
and health is okay.&#13;
3. Difficult, with food short and some famine food being eaten. Some&#13;
babies and old people may be unwell No lives at risk-&#13;
4. Very litIe food in gardens and it will not last for more than 3&#13;
weeks. Famine food being eaten by many people. Their is said to be&#13;
increasing siclness and there are signs of poor nutri on. The lives of&#13;
small childrrn and old people are at rist&#13;
5. No food left in gardens. Only famine food available. An extreme&#13;
situation with many penple, not eafing, and small r.hildrmn and old&#13;
people dying.&#13;
6. No food left in gardens. People eating food supplied by famine&#13;
relief effort.&#13;
Establish whether an adequate supply offood is available in the area Note that&#13;
"adequate amount" is not a "normal" or a 'usual- amount An "adequate aimount" is&#13;
enough to keep people alive without risk of sickness or starvation. 'Food' includes&#13;
coconuts, sago, pandanus nuts or other important seasonal tree crops, even if they are not&#13;
normally eaten as a main food, as long as they are providing an 'adequatm' food supply.&#13;
'Food' does not include bush leaves, banana stems, and other 'famine foods'.&#13;
To assess whether an adequate supply is avaiable will require discussions with&#13;
people about wbat they are eating now, visits to some gardens (be aware of where you are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
in relation to villages and roads), looldng in women's bilums and talking to school&#13;
teachers, missionaries and other people living in the area who can be expected to have a&#13;
good sense of what is happening there. Be wary of political leaders or local area&#13;
administators who may want to be seen to be succesfully bring relief to an area that does&#13;
not need it ye.&#13;
If there is food available, whz is its source? Is it from gardens, from sago, or&#13;
from cash purchases?&#13;
If sago is normally eaten everyday or as a seasonal supplementary food and it is&#13;
not being eac  now, explnin.why nOL If sago ig available but is not being eaten explain&#13;
why not.&#13;
How long do you estimate the food, sago or cash being used to buy food, will&#13;
last?&#13;
If you think it will last for at least 2 months, you can rank the area 1. unless there is&#13;
some other reason not to.&#13;
If it willast for a shorter period you w   need to rank the area higher, perhaps a 4&#13;
for 2 weeks more food , a 3 for 4 weeks and a 2 for 6 weeks.&#13;
If there is no food available then the area is Category 5.&#13;
If the food being eaten is coming from relief supplies (delivered by any&#13;
organisation, provincial government, RAAF, missions etc), hen assign the area Category&#13;
6. Try and estimate how long the food supplied will last, whether everyone who needs it&#13;
has received it and whether enough has been provided to satisfy the numbers of people in&#13;
the area Give details of who is providing the food, its type and methods of delivery and&#13;
disuibutioa&#13;
If you believe that an area is receiving relief food when food is still available from&#13;
gardens or sago or tee crops, then assign a 1-5 rating and flag the fact that food aid has&#13;
been delivered with details of source, amount (if 'own) and when it was delivered-&#13;
Use other indicators of food supply that can be used to confir, or cause you to&#13;
question, what people are saying:&#13;
- check local markets, what food is in the market, where does it come from?;&#13;
* are people feeding pigs and what are they using?;&#13;
*  is there access to a regular source of cash e.g. wages, gold mining, copra, royalties&#13;
*  are children absent from school because of food problems&#13;
-ooQoo-&#13;
Water Supply Cate,ory - In the fist assessment, water was not given a separate&#13;
rating from food. In this assessmcnt you are required to rate the water supply on a scale of&#13;
I to 5. The water ratings are listed in the box below. This is a drinking water raring. Do&#13;
not rate water supply on water for washing or making sago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
Water Supply Categories.&#13;
1. NVo local drinking water problems.&#13;
2. Local water sources dry. Good alternmative sources available&#13;
elsewhere.                                       1&#13;
3. Local water sources dry. Alternative sources available, possibly&#13;
slightly polluted, and at some distance.&#13;
4. Either small amnouts of poor quality water available locally or&#13;
better quality water available only at very long distances-&#13;
5. Water suppy ecxtrenely lidted, of very poor quality, salty or dirry,&#13;
and probably contaminarted possibly available only at long&#13;
distances.&#13;
Humans without water die within 36 hours. The fact that people are talking to you&#13;
means they must have water. Ask where it is coming from. ispect and taste the water&#13;
people are drinking. How long does it take to get it? Are coconuts providing a satisfactory&#13;
spurce of liquid&amp; Have people dug for water. How much water is being brought into&#13;
reprsepttive households each day, per person.&#13;
Ehalth&#13;
This is the most difficult condition to assess without expert medical opinion.&#13;
Pepple die a,ll the time and at times lice this, many deaths are blamed on drought or frosL&#13;
The ages and genders of people who have died recently (the last 4 weeks) may indicate a&#13;
chan&amp;e in the normal pattern of deaths. Wherever possible, ask local doctors, health cntre&#13;
wprkgrs, aid post orderlies, MCH clinic nurses whether they believe there is a general&#13;
ct4 pration in health and whether children arm become poorly nourished.&#13;
Replanting&#13;
The. sooner ir.planting can ooccir, thz. faster wil be. the. rcove.ry of food stupplies.&#13;
Ask whether people believe sufficient rain has fallen to start replanting? Is planting&#13;
material available? Are people buying replanting material from elsewhere. If it is not, what&#13;
is re-qired,&#13;
Migration&#13;
If fpQd J to be provided to communities it is important thaE movements of people are&#13;
known. However it is difficult to estimae how many people have moved when you cannot&#13;
see tten Try counting the number of empty houses as a proportion of the total houses.&#13;
,Asc for the names of the heads of families who have gone. Where place names are used&#13;
fto yT 0 onniko  v masur  you gct 'offiil' names znd not just loCal names. A census&#13;
diw"pn name would be ideal. Or the name of a town.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The El Nino Drought Response Project
            aims to help Papua New Guineans to cope better with drought
            and other natural disasters. The project applies innovative,
            decentralized approaches to deliver basic rural services
            involving churches, nongovernmental organizations, and local
            communities. To achieve the project's objectives, there
            are three components. The first enhances the participation
            of rural communities in maintaining rural infrastructure
            during emergenciesand provides them employment income.
            Eligible works include maintenance of access roads, drains,
            erodable sites, schools, health facilities, sewerage
            systems, airstrips, foot bridges, and construction of gabion
            baskets. The second component provides a sustainable,
            potable water supply to the most needy areas in targeted
            provinces by building new groundwater and other permanent
            supply sources and/or rehabilitates existing systems at
            strategic locations including schools, hospitals, health
            posts, and district centers. This component also tests
            methodologies to integrate rural water supply, hygiene
            education and social mobilization, and village level
            maintenance of all facilities. The third component supports
            Agricultural Research into 1) the selection and
            multiplication of drought and frost tolerant varieties of
            PNG's major staple foodcrops (sweet potato, taro,
            banana, cassava, yam, sago palm) and aibika (a popular leafy
            vegetable); and 2) soil moisture management and
            supplementary irrigation.
