ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper suggests an approach for analysis of distributional and&#13;
other change in incomes in fast growing cities in the developing world. It&#13;
notes that between 1973 and 1978 there appeared to be a tendency toward some&#13;
improvement in the distribution of income in the two Colombian cities of&#13;
Bogota and Cali. However, the level of inequality in the two cities remained&#13;
very high, possible among the highest in the world.&#13;
Among the distinguishing features of this study is the utilisation&#13;
of primary data from different household surveys, of comparable quality spread&#13;
over six years. Hence there is a high degree of confidence in the results&#13;
obtained. The paper uses different samples, inequality indices, income&#13;
concepts and ranking procedures in its analysis. It is found that, overall,&#13;
there is a higher level of inequality in Bogota than in Cali. Particular&#13;
attention is paid to the existence of spatial inequality among different parts&#13;
of the two cities by using an index of spatial income segregation (ISIS).&#13;
ISIS is found to be very high when the cities are disaggregated spatially into&#13;
radical sectors rather than into concentric rings. The main disquieting&#13;
feature of the findings is that ISIS appears to be increasing over time while&#13;
inequality within the sectors is declining; this suggests that the cities are&#13;
becoming more spatially segregated over time.&#13;
The inequality in labor earnings is also calculated and&#13;
decomposed. The paper finds that the industry of activity and the size of the&#13;
firm of the worker contribute very little to overall inequality in earnings,&#13;
in contrast to much of the labor segmentation literature. Instead, education,&#13;
occupation and the location of residence (or background) of the worker&#13;
contributed most to inequality in earnings. The results of the study suggest&#13;
that increases in spatial inequality in household as well as labour earnings&#13;
could have deleterious effects on the distribution of income in the future.&#13;
Finally, in addition to sixteen tables and eight appendices, the&#13;
paper carries a special computer program call EQUALISE which can compute&#13;
income distribution indices directly from household data and decompose income&#13;
inequality accordng to any characteristics.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En el presente documento se propone un metodo para el andlisis de los&#13;
cambios en la distribuci6n y otros aspectos de los ingresos en las ciudades del&#13;
mundo en desarrollo en proceso de rapido crecimiento. Se observa en 41 que,&#13;
entre 1973 y 1978, parecia haber una tendencia hacia una mejor distribuci6n de&#13;
los ingresos en las ciudades colombianas de Bogota y Cali. Sin embargo, el&#13;
nivel de desigualdad en las dos ciudades sigui6 siendo muy grande, y&#13;
posiblemente se cuenta entre los mAs altos del mundo.&#13;
Una de las caracterfsticas distintivas de este estudio es la utilizaci6n de&#13;
datos primarios de diversas encuestas de unidades familiares de calidad&#13;
comparable esparcidas en el curso de seis affos. De allf que haya un alto grado&#13;
de confianza en los resultados obtenidos. El documento usa en su anAlisis&#13;
diferentes muestras, indices de desigualdad, conceptos de ingresos y&#13;
procedimientos de jerarquizaci6n. Llega a la conclusi6n de que, en general, hay&#13;
un mayor nivel de desigualdad en Bogota que en Cali. Dedica atenci6n preferente&#13;
a la existencia de una desigualdad espacial entre diversas partes de las dos&#13;
ciudades al utilizar un fndice de desagregaci6n espacial de los ingresos. Halla&#13;
que este fndice es muy alto cuando las ciudades se desglosan espacialmente en&#13;
sectores radiales y no en anillos concentricos. La principal caracterfstica&#13;
perturbadora de las conclusiones es que el fndice de desagregaci6n espacial de&#13;
los ingresos parece aumentar con el tiempo en tanto que la desigualdad dentro de&#13;
los sectores esta disminuyendo; esto indica que con el correr del tiempo las&#13;
ciudades se estan volviendo mgs segregadas espacialmente.&#13;
Tambidn se calcula y desglosa en el documento la desigualdad de los&#13;
ingresos de los trabajadores. Se llega a la conclusi6n de que el tipo de&#13;
industria de la actividad y el tamaflo de la empresa a que pertenece el&#13;
trabajador contribuyen muy poco a la desigualdad general de los ingresos,&#13;
contrariamente a lo que se sostiene en gran parte del material escrito sobre el&#13;
desglose de la mano de obra. En cambio la educaci6n, la ocupaci6n y el lugar de&#13;
residencia (o los antecedentes) del trabajador son elementos que han contribuido&#13;
mas a la desigualdad de lo ingresos. Los resultados del estudio indican que&#13;
los aumentos de la desigualdad espacial de los ingresos tanto de las unidades&#13;
familiares como de los trabajadores podrfan tener efectos perjudiciales sobre la&#13;
distribuci6n de los ingresos en el futuro.&#13;
Finalmente, ademas de 16 cuadros y 8 apendices, el documento presenta un&#13;
programa especial de computadora llamado EQUALISE con el que pueden calcularse&#13;
indices de distribuci6n de los ingresos directamente a partir de los datos de&#13;
las unidades familiares y descomponer la desigualdad de los ingresos de acuerdo&#13;
con cualquier caracterfsticas.&#13;

importantes et pourraient meme etre parmi les plus fortes du monde.&#13;
La presente etude se caracterise, entre autres, par l'utilisa-&#13;

obtenus sont donc juges tres fiables. L'auteur utilise differents 6chan-&#13;
tillons, indices d'in6galite, concepts de revenu et procedures de classe-&#13;
ment dans le cadre de son analyse. Selon lui, les inegalites sont, dans&#13;
l'ensemble, plus prononcees a Bogota qu'a Cali. Il accorde une attention&#13;
particuliere aux inegalites qui existent entre differents quartiers des&#13;
deux villes et, a cette fin, utilise un indice de segr6gation spatiale des&#13;
revenus. Cet indice prend une valeur tres elev6e lorsque les villes sont&#13;
decoup6es en secteurs radiaux plutot qu'en cercles concentriques. Le&#13;
resultat le plus inquietant est que cet indice parait augmenter dans le&#13;
temps alors meme que les inegalites au sein de chacun des secteurs&#13;
diminuent; la segregation g6ographique semblerait donc s'intensifier avec&#13;
les annees.&#13;

main-d'oeuvre.   Ce sont le niveau d'education, le type d'emploi et le lieu&#13;
de residence (ou l'environnement) de l'employe qui contribuent le plus a&#13;
l'inegalite des revenus salariaux. L'6tude suggere que tout accroissement&#13;
des inegalites g6ographiques enregistrees au niveau des revenus des&#13;
menages ainsi que des salaires pourrait avoir un effet d6favorable sur la&#13;
repartition des revenus dans les annees a venir.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper is part of the City Study research program (RPO 671-47) which&#13;
has been carried out in Bogota and Cali, Colombia by the World Bank in&#13;
collaboration with the Corporacion Centro Regional de Poblacion of Bogota.&#13;
The goal of the City Study is to increase the understanding of the workings of&#13;
five major urban sectors - housing, transport, employment location, labor&#13;
markets, and public finance - in order that the impact of policies and&#13;
projects can be assessed more accurately.&#13;
A rather large amount of data handling, documentation, and preparation&#13;
has gone into the work leading to this paper. I would like to thank Alan&#13;
Carroll for the original cleaning and documentation of the 1975 and 1977&#13;
Household Surveys; Nelson Valverde for making the 1973 Population Census&#13;
Sample ready for use; Nancy Hartline for wrestling with the 1977 Household&#13;
Survey, preparing its final documentation, and putting the income imputing&#13;
method into effect; Sungyong Kang and M.Wilhelm Wagner for making the 1978&#13;
sample ready for use.&#13;
The computations appearing in this paper have been prepared by Sungyong&#13;
Kang and Robert Marshall. A word of special thanks goes to them.&#13;
My intellectual debt to Sudhir Anand is obvious from the text of the&#13;
paper. Original programming of parts of the program EQUALISE appearing as&#13;
appendix III was done by Sudhir Anand and Sherman Robinson. I am grateful to&#13;
them for making available their programs. I have also benefited from&#13;
discussions with and the pioneering works on income distribution in Colombia&#13;
of Miguel Urrutia and R. Albert Berry.&#13;
A special word of appreciation goes to the staff of DANE (the Colombian&#13;
Statistical Office) for having painstakingly conducted all the surveys in&#13;
Colombia and for making them available in almost raw form so readily. The&#13;
high quality of the 1978 City Study DANE Household Survey owes much to the&#13;
diligence of Roberto Pinilla and Maria Cristina Jimenez of DANE and Gary Losee&#13;
Alfredo Aliaga, Alvaro Pachon and Jairo Arias for CCRP-World Bank.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1       Objectives&#13;
This paper is part of the program of research on urban labour&#13;
markets and income distribution in the cities of Bogota and Cali that has&#13;
been conducted under the rubric of the City Study. Earlier papersll have&#13;
developed a profile of the distribution of income as well as the labour&#13;
market somewhat descriptively. One of the striking results was the&#13;
appearance of significant differences between different areas of the city&#13;
in terms of income and occupation. The existence of these spatial&#13;
differences was also utilized as an additional variable analysing the&#13;
determinants of income in Mohan (1981). This paper attempts to measure&#13;
the distribution of income somewhat more systematically and provides a&#13;
spatial decomposition of the inequality indices estimated. In so doing a&#13;
measure of the spatial inequality of income within cities suggests itself.&#13;
The availability of micro data sets for 4 different years from&#13;
1973 to 1978 permits the estimation of inequality indices for this whole&#13;
period. It is unusual to have access to such micro data and to be able to&#13;
make such estimations across data sets consistently. The comparisons&#13;
between different years give a sense of the robustness (or otherwise) of&#13;
the estimates derived. They also suggest caution in the over-&#13;
interpretation of small changes in such indices between different&#13;
surveys. Nonetheless the estimates for these years are compared with&#13;
those available for earlier years.&#13;
Mohan (1981) examined in detail the determinants of personal&#13;
earnings. Those findings are supplemented here by the decomposition of&#13;
the earnings distribution according to various characteristics of the&#13;
1/ See Mohan (1980) and Mohan and Hartline (1980)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
labour force. The results are largely similar but the decompositions do&#13;
give further insight into the distribution of labour earnings.&#13;
Most income distribution studies use grouped data to calculate&#13;
the inequality indices. Sometimes, only published data are available&#13;
which give data for the distribution of the population by specific income&#13;
groups:  there is then no choice but to use such grouped data.    Even when&#13;
micro data are available, computation is usually done after the data are&#13;
grouped because of the expense involved in making direct calculations from&#13;
the micro data.   A similar procedure is used here but Appendix III lists&#13;
EQUALISE, the computer program used, which takes micro data directly as&#13;
input and permits any level of dissagregation desired for the computation&#13;
of inequality indices. An extension of the same program is used to do the&#13;
decomposition of inequality.i/&#13;
The objective of this paper is therefore to document the&#13;
distribution of income in Bogota and Cali and to give some indications of&#13;
the pattern of change that may have occurred in the recent past. A novel&#13;
feature of this paper is the computation of spatial inequality within a&#13;
city. This has been done particularly because spatial inequality was&#13;
found to be quite marked in the cities under investigation.&#13;
The computation of inequality indices has been done for both&#13;
household income as well as household income per capita (henceforth&#13;
referred to as HINCAP) and later for earned incomes. The concepts and&#13;
1/ Parts of the program were originally developed by&#13;
Sherman Robinson and Sudhir Anand in earlier studies of&#13;
income distribution for the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

methodology used are laid out in the next parts of this introduction. The&#13;
sections following present the results that have been obtained.&#13;
1.2       Income Concepts Used&#13;
Appendix II gives a brief description of the sources of data&#13;
used in this study. The incomes used are all monthly incomes - derived in&#13;
the different surveys as detailed in the appendix. All the incomes&#13;
measured are current incomes and therefore some caution needs to be&#13;
exercised in interpreting them as measures of welfare.      Household&#13;
consumption expenditures are, in general, regarded as a better proxy of&#13;
permanent income and hence of welfare levels of households and&#13;
individuals. There is little choice, here, since there have been no&#13;
recent surveys of consumption in Colombia. The computation of inequality&#13;
by using current household income or household income per capita (HINCAP)&#13;
also suffers from yet another problem.     It fails to take into account the&#13;
differential tax incidence on different incomes according to the&#13;
prevailing tax structure in the country. Similarly, no adjustsment is&#13;
made of the differential accrual to different income groups of the&#13;
benefits due to public expenditure on public services such as health,&#13;
education, sanitation, water, etc L/.&#13;
Although, as is detailed in Appendix II, somewhat different&#13;
income questions were asked in the four sources used - the 1973 Census,&#13;
1/ See Selowsky (1979) for explicit consideration of these in the&#13;
computation of inequality in Colombia.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
the 1975 and 1977 DANEi' household surveys and in the 1978 DANE-World Bank&#13;
City Study Household Survey, the basic income concepts used here have been&#13;
the Monthly Household Income (HHY) and the Monthly Household Income per&#13;
Capita (HINCAP). HINCAP is merely the HHY divided by the household size&#13;
(HHSIZE). In principle, HHY includes the labour earnings of all members&#13;
of the household, including earnings in kind, as well as non-labour&#13;
income. Earnings in kind are not taken to include imputed earnings for&#13;
household work. The coverage of labour earnings in all the surveys is&#13;
much better than the coverage of non-labor income. The 1978 survey&#13;
included detailed questions on non-labour income which were addressed&#13;
specifically according to types of non-labour income. However, it is&#13;
suspected that the coverage was still less than desirable.    HHY does not&#13;
include imputed income from housing for owner occupying households.&#13;
Section IV of the paper analyses the distribution of labour&#13;
earnings of individuals. Here, naturally, only individual labour earnings&#13;
are used in the computation. Non-labour earnings are completely ignored.&#13;
One important point worthy of note is that all households with&#13;
zero incomes have been excluded in the computation of income inequality.&#13;
Similarly, other households with miscoded location were also excluded.&#13;
For the workers, the definition included those individuals who gave their&#13;
primary activity as working and others who worked at least 15 hours a&#13;
week. The households with zero incomes were essentially those whose&#13;
members happened to be unemployed. As is mentioned in the Appendix II on&#13;

National Statistical Agency, Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
data, income was systematically imputed to those workers who were employed&#13;
but who did not give information on their incomes.&#13;
Studies on inequality have to choose the population unit as well&#13;
as the income concept by which they should be ranked in order to derive&#13;
income distributions. The most common distribution used has been that of&#13;
households ranked by household income. This distribution has come under&#13;
attack increasingly in recent works (e.g. Anand, 1982; Datta and Meerman,&#13;
1980) as not providing a good indication of differences in the level of&#13;
living in the population. As argued by Anand, our general concern is with&#13;
the welfare of individuals rather than households. Secondly, households&#13;
vary by size as well as by composition in terms of age and sex. Hence,&#13;
for true cross household comparisons, adjustments should be made to&#13;
account for these variations. In some of the literature concerning the&#13;
measurement of poverty based on nutrition levels, adjustments have been&#13;
attempted by deriving "adult equivalent" measures of consumption. While&#13;
some norms may be found for deriving adult equivalents based on age and&#13;
sex for food consumption purposes, it is difficult to do so for&#13;
consumption as a whole. For example, it may well be that, while a child&#13;
may require less nutrition than an adult, expenditures on his/her&#13;
education and health might well exceed those for adults. It is therefore&#13;
difficult to estimate adult equivalents for total consumption purposes.&#13;
The next best strategy is followed therefore and HINCAP (household income&#13;
adjusted for household size) is used to rank households and individuals&#13;
for welfare comparisons. This is certainly better than the use of HHY&#13;
even though economies of scale in consumption are also ignored in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
computation of HINCAP.    It is assumed implicitly that distribution within&#13;
the household is even - though some might argue that this is usually not&#13;
the case.   In any case, there is no information which could be used to&#13;
make any other assumption.&#13;
Although it is being argued that it is individual welfare that&#13;
we are interested in, the basic income concept from which HINCAP is&#13;
derived is HHY. There is really no other choice since the household is&#13;
the basic consumption unit where consumption allocations are typically&#13;
made. Furthermore, non-labour income usually accrues to the household&#13;
rather than the individual.&#13;
The distributions that are analyzed then in sections 11 and III&#13;
are:&#13;
i) The distribution of households ranked by household income.&#13;
ii)  The distribution of households ranked by household income&#13;
per capita.&#13;
iii)  The distribution of individuals ranked by household income&#13;
capita.&#13;
Section IV gives the analysis of the distribution of workers&#13;
ranked by labour income, which includes income in kind.&#13;
1.3. Measures of Income Inequality&#13;
Various inequality measures have been utilized in this study and&#13;
then two used for decomposition purposes.     The measures displayed in the&#13;
tables are:&#13;
i) Gini coefficient&#13;
ii) Theil inequality index&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
iii) The standard deviation of logarithims&#13;
iv) Atkinson index&#13;
v) Coefficient of variation&#13;
The Gini coefficient, the standard deviation of logs and the&#13;
coefficient of variation need no explanation since they are the most&#13;
commonly used and well known measures. Although TheiLL/ and&#13;
Atkinson2/ are now well known, their use in the computation of inequality&#13;
is still not common. Anand (1982) gives a comprehensive theoretical&#13;
introduction to all these measures so only a brief explanation of Theil&#13;
and Atkinson is offered here..!&#13;
Two important properties of inequality measures that are&#13;
regarded as desirable are:&#13;
i)    They be mean-independent (i.e. their value remain unchanged&#13;
if everyone's income is increased by the same proportion).&#13;
ti)    They satisfy the "Pigon-Dalton" condition which&#13;
requires that any transfer from a richer person to a poorer&#13;
person (which does not change their relative ranks) be&#13;
reflected in a reduction of the inequality index. Simply&#13;
put, a transfer from a richer to a poorer person without&#13;
changing their ranks should imply higher equality as&#13;
measured by the index.&#13;
The Gini coefficient satisfies these two conditions, as does the&#13;
coefficient of variation (the square root of variance divided by the mean).&#13;
1/ First proposed in Theil (1967) and applied in Theil (1972).&#13;
2/ Atkinson (1970).&#13;
3/ The following is taken from Anand (1982) (Annex A) and Theil (1972).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The variance of incomes, which would be an obvious measure of the&#13;
inequality in a distribution, does satisfy the Pigon-Dalton condition but&#13;
is obviously not mean independent. The log variance of income, (or the&#13;
variance of the logarithm of incomes) does, however, satisfy both these&#13;
conditions:&#13;
1    n2&#13;
Var (y)   - n  i    (y.  -     &#13;
hence       Var (Xy) = X2   Var (y)&#13;
but         Var (log X y) = Var (log y)&#13;
where yi is income of unit i,&#13;
p is the mean&#13;
and X is the a proportionate change in all incomes. The log variance of&#13;
incomes is therefore a convenient measure to use-LI The main problem in&#13;
its use is that the measure is not defined when there are zero incomes in&#13;
the sample. This is the main reason for the exclusion of all zero incomes&#13;
in the sample. It is also an attractive measure to use because of its&#13;
decomposition properties - as will be detailed below.&#13;
1.31 An Introduction to the Theil Index&#13;
The Theil index is based on the concept of expected information&#13;
in a distribution. Essentially, when the probability of an event&#13;
1 The Pigon-Dalton condition is satisfied for log variance for all incomes&#13;
except those over P e where p is the geometric mean income and e is the&#13;
base of natural logarithms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
occurring is low, the information contained in a message stating that it&#13;
has occurred is high. Intuitively, then, information can be regarded as&#13;
the converse of probability. As a precise measure of information&#13;
contained in a message that states that an event with prior probability p&#13;
has occurred, the function suggested is:&#13;
h (p) = log -                                       (1)&#13;
p&#13;
which ranges from      (when p is small, the event is unlikely and hence&#13;
when it does occur, information in the message stating that it has&#13;
occurred is high) to zero (when p=l, the event is certain). For a&#13;
distribution of events, each with probability pi (i = 1, ...n) and&#13;
i-li Pi1&#13;
The expected information of the message on the occurrence of one of these&#13;
events is&#13;
H1=  in     pi  log -                               (2)&#13;
i.e. the weighted average of the information contained in each message.&#13;
The minimum of this distribution is when&#13;
p. = 1 and all&#13;
Pi = 0 (i 3 j)&#13;
i.e. H = log 1 =0&#13;
and the maximum is when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
p. = P. = n   for all i    j&#13;
p   1- ~n&#13;
Then H=          -   log&#13;
i=1        n    n&#13;
= log n.&#13;
H is also known as entropy. In its application to the&#13;
measurement of income distribution, it can be interpreted as a measure of&#13;
uncertainty. Higher the uncertainty in a distribution, greater the&#13;
expected information in the message stating that an event has occurred&#13;
from the distribution of possible events, hence the entropy of a&#13;
distributton may be said to measure the "amount of uncertainty" in it. It&#13;
is similar to variance which is the more common measure used to measure&#13;
uncertainty.&#13;
Now consider an income distribution,&#13;
z1, z2. .zn&#13;
i.e. n individuals with income zi.&#13;
Let Z = n. z&#13;
i=1 i&#13;
z.&#13;
Then     nZ 11     =1.&#13;
=1- Z&#13;
The entropy of the income distribution can then be defined&#13;
zi&#13;
Let   qi    Z&#13;
hence    Eq= 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and all    q. &gt; 0&#13;
n           11&#13;
Then         H(q)        l   q. logq&#13;
q.&#13;
as for any distribution of probabilities&#13;
Hr (q) = Z -Z   log   -      (all summations are from 1 to n)&#13;
i/&#13;
z.&#13;
but Z = n z&#13;
where    z is the mean of the distribution&#13;
Then   H(q) = Z       log&#13;
nz          z./nz&#13;
n&#13;
=- 1  ,.      log   n;\&#13;
n           z AI zi/&#13;
Iz             z.&#13;
n   E  ¢- log n +       log&#13;
Z         i/Z/&#13;
I.   z&#13;
-  n   z  log n     +  E          log     I&#13;
Z. ~     Zi/&#13;
=   log n +     E         log     1  )                   (3)&#13;
Now if,      zi = Z;   for all i = j&#13;
11&#13;
z = z&#13;
and H(q) = log n.&#13;
and if all income is earned by one individual j,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
z      Z  = nz&#13;
1   nz&#13;
H(q)  =   log n +          -    log&#13;
n/&#13;
;z        nz/z&#13;
=  log n +-      n log-&#13;
n       ~~n&#13;
= log n - log n&#13;
= 0.&#13;
Hence entropy is high with low inequality while it is low with&#13;
high inequality. Intuitively then, if we want an index which is low for&#13;
low inequality and high for high inequality we can arbitrarily define&#13;
T = log n - H(q)                                               (4)&#13;
to measure the departure of an income distribution from an even&#13;
distribution.&#13;
In fact the Theil Index (T) of income inequality is defined as&#13;
"The expected information of the message which transforms population&#13;
shares into income shares." Consider again an event E with prior&#13;
probability p. If a message is now received that the probability of this&#13;
event has changed to q, what is the information contained in this&#13;
message? The prior probability of the event occurring is p and the&#13;
posterior probability is q. Now when the event does occur, the&#13;
information provided by that message would be h(q). Hence, if the&#13;
information content of the intermediary message changing the probability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to q, is I,&#13;
I + h(q) = h(p)&#13;
or I  = h(p)   -  h(q)  =  log   q&#13;
p&#13;
Again, this can be applied to a distribution of probabilities&#13;
1    P2 .Pn)    being changed to&#13;
(q,' q2' .* qn)-&#13;
The expected information or entropy of the message changing the&#13;
probabilities is then&#13;
n              q.&#13;
I (q:p) =   il   q.  log   Pi&#13;
i.e. weighted average of the information for each event - the weighting&#13;
being done by the posterior probability.    "I" may be regarded as a measure&#13;
of the "differentness" of the second distribution     (qi)  from the first&#13;
(p.).&#13;
Note that if   Pi=       i.e.&#13;
n&#13;
the case of equiprobability,&#13;
n        ~~~q.&#13;
I (q:p)  =     l q   log    n&#13;
= log n - Zqi   log 1&#13;
qi&#13;
which is the same form as T, in equation (4). The interpretation is that&#13;
T is a measure of the departure from complete equality. Since an&#13;
individual's share in a population of n is     1,    the distribution of&#13;
n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
population shares ( pi, P2    ...P)   is an even distribution.   When we are&#13;
then provided with their income distribution, their share of income may be&#13;
regarded as the posterior distribution and we arrive at the original&#13;
definition of the Theil index as "The expected information of the message&#13;
which transforms population shares into income shares."&#13;
Methodology Used in EQUALISE&#13;
It is clear then that the value of the Theil index varies from&#13;
zero for perfect equality to log n for the extreme case where one&#13;
individual gets all the income and the other (n-1) individuals earn&#13;
nothing. This raises a problem of comparability of the Theil index&#13;
between different populations since it is dependent on the magnitude of&#13;
n. One method of normalization is to compute T as a proportion of log n,&#13;
its feasible maximum value for the population at hand. This has not been&#13;
utilized in this paper since all the calculations have been done on the&#13;
basis of 20 quantiles drawn from each sample. The procedure adopted in&#13;
EQUALISE is to compute each inequality index on the basis of the income&#13;
share received by each quantile of population. As mentioned earlier, the&#13;
program makes it possible to use ail the observations available or to&#13;
aggregate them into quantiles. Experiments were done using different&#13;
numbers of quantiles and 20 was chosen as a convenient number large enough&#13;
to give reasonable accuracy in the computation.      As evident from&#13;
equations (3) and (4) the only information needed for the calculation of&#13;
the Theil index is&#13;
i) income shares and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
ii)  population shares&#13;
for a defined number of population groups. in the case of 20 quantiles,&#13;
n = 20&#13;
and, in principle, the index is calculated as if there were 29 individuals&#13;
in the population. The magnitudes of the Theil indices for the different&#13;
years and different sized samples are therefore directly comparable in&#13;
this study.&#13;
1.32   The Atkinson Index-/&#13;
Atkinson's index was originally suggested by Atkinson (1970) and&#13;
is different in that it is based on a social welfare function evaluating&#13;
alternative income distributions. The principle is to measure the&#13;
departure from the existing per capita income from that "equally&#13;
distributed income" which would achieve the same level of social welfare&#13;
as the given distribution. The definition is independent of the social&#13;
welfare function chosen but Atkinson restricts his set of welfare&#13;
functions to additively separable and symmetric functions. The "equally&#13;
distributed income" zE   is defined by&#13;
n U(ZE)        nE   U (Z                                      (5)&#13;
E     ~i-i    (i)&#13;
where the right hand side U is the social welfare function chosen. Then&#13;
the Atkinson index&#13;
zE&#13;
A = 1 -   -                                                   (6)&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
where z is the mean income of the distribution of incomes&#13;
(z1 z2 ... Zn)&#13;
as before.&#13;
For the function to satisfy the first condition, i.e. be mean-&#13;
independent, U(z) must be of the constant marginal utility form i.e.&#13;
U (z)       I  z1-        E&#144;1&#13;
(log z               1.&#13;
For values of   c &gt; ,0,  U(z) is concave&#13;
and              ZE    Z.&#13;
e mesures"inequality aversion": the greater that e is more weight is&#13;
attached to income transfers to the poor. As reported by Anand (1982)&#13;
thre seems to be general agreement at placing the value of       £ between 1.5&#13;
and 2.5: EQUALISE uses    e = 2.0&#13;
Now  A = 1 _   E&#13;
z&#13;
Hence, the lower the   zE E  or greater the departure of   ZE   from&#13;
z, greater is the implied welfare loss from inequality.&#13;
1.4 Decomposition of Inequality&#13;
A special interest in this study is the measurement of spatial&#13;
inequality. But the problem is a general one where one wants to measure&#13;
the inequality between groups as opposed to interpersonal inequality. The&#13;
traditional method of doing this has been the measurement of differences&#13;
1/  The Atkinson index cannot be computed for values e 7, of 41 if there are&#13;
zero incomes in the sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
between the means of incomes between the groups. This naturally ignores&#13;
the distribution of incomes within the groups and does not give a sense of&#13;
the contribution of between group inequality to total inequality. It is&#13;
quite possible, for example, for within group inequality to be so large&#13;
for each group that even with widely differing means between the groups,&#13;
the contribution of between group inequality to total inequality would be&#13;
small. This was found to be the case, for example, for inter-regional&#13;
inequality in Colombia,by Fields and Schultz (1977). Obviously the more&#13;
homogeneous each group is higher the contribution of between group&#13;
inequality. The decomposition of inequality between and within groups can&#13;
therefore also be used as a test for the degree of homogeneity within a&#13;
group. The decomposition of labour earnings, for example, as has been&#13;
done in Section IV, between occupations and other personal characteristics&#13;
is useful in analysing the homogeneity of earnings within occupations.&#13;
Essentially, the between group component of inequality is the&#13;
value of the inequality index when the within group inequality is&#13;
suppressed.   In the methodology for the Theil index outlined above as used&#13;
in EQUALISE, for example, the index is calculated by dividing the&#13;
population into quantiles. The index calculated is essentially the&#13;
between group inequalit:y between quantiles assuming that everyone in the&#13;
quantile earns the mean of the quantile. Overall inequality is therefore&#13;
somewhat understated - the larger the number of quantiles, the smaller&#13;
would be the error. Similarly, the within group component is then the&#13;
inequality assuming that there is no between group inequality - for a mean&#13;
independent index it is merely a weighted average of the within group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
inequalities. The weighting in the Theil index is by the income shares of&#13;
each group while the weighting in the log-variance is by population&#13;
shares. Both the log-variance and Theil indices are additive decomposable&#13;
i.e. the sum of the between group and within group inequalities gives the&#13;
overall inequality. This is not true for the Gini coefficient.&#13;
Decomposition of the Theil Index&#13;
To understand the decomposition of the Theil index, it is useful&#13;
to recall the derivation of the Theil index as an information&#13;
expectation.11 Consider n events    E1, E2 ...En   and G sets of events&#13;
SIP S2' ..   SG  such that each set   S  has  kg   events where&#13;
n =  Gg k&#13;
g=1 g&#13;
The probability of the set Sg occurring is&#13;
g     i£ pi                                                   (7)&#13;
g&#13;
and the entropy at the level of sets is&#13;
Ho  =  GE   P   log  1                                         (8)&#13;
o     g=1 Pg   lo   9&#13;
This is "between group entropy n - analogous to between group inequality.&#13;
Now "total" entropy at the level of events is&#13;
H  =     n   P   log   p&#13;

hence the expected information of a message transforming prior&#13;

analogous manner as the entropy for groups.&#13;
We can now return to income inequality where the       pi   are&#13;
population shares and    qi   are income shares with    Pi   now being&#13;
aggregated into groups of individuals with population shares         P    and&#13;

Hence,&#13;
Q    is the income share of group    Sg, and P    is the&#13;
population share of group   S   .&#13;
Thus the overall Theil index is the sum of the between group&#13;
Theil index (or contribution to inequality) and a weighted average of the&#13;
within group Theil indices - the weights used being the income shares&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
Q .    Income shares are used because they are regarded as the posterior&#13;
probabilities. When the groups used are quantiles, it is easily seen that&#13;
the within group inequality is suppressed and regarded as zero because&#13;
everyone is taken to receive the mean income within the quantile.&#13;
The decomposition of log variance may be done just like the&#13;
decomposition of any variance into between group and within group&#13;
components.L/   It may be noted, however, that the weighting of the within&#13;
group components, unlike for the Theil decomposition, is by the population&#13;
shares of each group. Log variance is also additively decomposable such&#13;
that total inequality is the sum of between group and within group&#13;
inequality.    The log variance is very sensitive to small changes at low&#13;
income levels - hence the inclusion of one or a few very low incomes in a&#13;
sample would tend to heighten inequality as measured by log variance. One&#13;
advantage of using log variance is that the ratio of between - group and&#13;
within group variance follows an F-Distribution. Hence the ratio can be&#13;
tested for statistical significance. The measures described here are&#13;
essentially descriptive - they have normative content. It is difficult to&#13;
find any means of evaluating the comparative magnitudes of the percentage&#13;
between group contributions to total inequality as measured by the Theil&#13;
index and the log variance. Hence both measures are given in this&#13;
study: the closeness of results between the two then gives greater&#13;
confidence in the results and the converse.&#13;

decomposition.&#13;

II. OVERALL TRENDS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME&#13;
2.1 Trends in Colombia as a Whole&#13;
Good data on the distribution of income in Colombia&#13;
have become available only in the last 15 years or so. The 1973&#13;
census was the first census in the country to include a question&#13;
on income. The first household surveys were conducted by CEDE-/&#13;
in the mid to the late sixties but these were largely confined&#13;
to urban areas. DANE conducted a nationwide household survey in&#13;
1970 which probably gave the first real nationwide estimates of&#13;
income distribution. It is therefore difficult to make compari-&#13;
sons of the current distribution of income with historical trends.&#13;
However, in a pioneering book on the subject, Berry and Urrutia&#13;
(1976) pieced together information from a multitude of sources&#13;
in an attempt to reach conclusions on trends since the late&#13;
nineteen thirties.&#13;
They used 1964 as the bench mark year and derived the&#13;
distribution of income for the economically active population.&#13;
The 1964 census provided a generally accurate distribution of&#13;
occupations and activities. They used the 1967-1969 CEDE unemploy-&#13;
ment survey to derive income estimates for urban areas and applied&#13;
the 1964 occupational distribution to obtain a notional distribution&#13;
of earnings :Ln urban areas. For rural areas they used the&#13;
agricultural census of 1960 and various later sources for the&#13;

Statistical Agency, Colombia.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
distribution of land and of agricultural production. Table 1&#13;
summarizes their findings for rural areas, urban areas and the&#13;
country as a whole. Their results were somewhat surprising in&#13;
that they revealed a distribution of income in the country which&#13;
was among the most unequal in the world. The top 5 percent of&#13;
income earners earned as much as 30 - 40 percent of total income&#13;
and the Gini coefficient ranged from 0.55 to 0.57. Inequality&#13;
was somewhat higher in rural areas than in urban areas due to a&#13;
highly skewed pattern of land holdings. In an international&#13;
comparison reported by Berry and Urrutia themselves, only one&#13;
estimate for Brazil reported an income distribution more unequal&#13;
than that in Colombia.&#13;
Selowsky (1979) conducted a nationwide survey in 1974&#13;
and his results on income distribution for the population as a&#13;
whole ranked by    HINCAP    are also reported in&#13;
Table 1.     The distribution derived by him was substantially&#13;
better for rural areas than for urban areas: a finding contrary&#13;
to the Berry-Urrutia estimates for 1964. Few conclusions can be&#13;
drawn about trends from these two studies, however, because the&#13;
Berry-Urrutia data were estimates pieced together from diverse&#13;
set of sources while the Selowsky estimates come from one survey.&#13;
His sample size was small and questions have also been raised about&#13;
the quality of responses to the sole income question in his survey.-V&#13;
1/ 4,000 thousand households were sampled in which rural areas were&#13;
somewhat underrepresented. (Selowsky 1979, p. 15).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
The two estimations are agreed on one point: The degree of income&#13;
inequality in Colombia is high and has been for some time with&#13;
Gini coefficients ranging between 0.50 and 0.57 for the country&#13;
as a whole. For purposes of comparison, Table 1 also gives&#13;
estimates for Malaysia in 1970. In comparison, the distribution for&#13;
Colombia is significantly worse for 1964 but only marginally so for 1974.&#13;
Berry and Urrutia also examined the available data&#13;
going back up to the 1930s. They essentially compiled wage series&#13;
for various groups of workers and then attempted to derive the&#13;
income distribution for the population. Their main conclusions&#13;
were&#13;
"(1) That income distribution in agriculture has&#13;
worsened throughout the period since the mid-1930s.&#13;
(2) That the non-agricultural income distribution&#13;
probably worsened from the mid 1930s until some&#13;
time in the early 1950s, then improved till some&#13;
time in the mid 1960s, and then tended to level off." -/&#13;
They speculate that the distribution of income generally&#13;
tends to worsen during periods of rapid growth while it improves&#13;
during periods of slow growth. The late1940s and the early 1950s&#13;
were a period of rapid industrialization and creation of new&#13;
industries under conditions of substantial protection. If these&#13;
protected industries can be assumed to be relatively highly capital&#13;
intensive such a pattern of industrialization could be expected to&#13;
1/ Berry and Urrutia (1976) p. 89.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
lead to a lower labor share of total earnings. Protected industries&#13;
would, moreover, tend to generate monopoly profits. With the ownership&#13;
of capital being highly skewed, such industrialization can therefore&#13;
expected to lead a worsening of income distribution. Rural-urban&#13;
migr,tiLion wis a lsn verv highl during this period (Mohan, 1980)&#13;
and particularly in the late forties up to the mid fifties during&#13;
the period of the "violencia". Thus unskilled, blue collar wages&#13;
may have been kept down during this period because of this&#13;
unlimited supply of labor into the cities. The burst of indus-&#13;
trialization also created a sudden demand for highly skilled and&#13;
educated workers and consequently their real earnings rose at&#13;
very high rates between 1945 and 1953. The whole period from the&#13;
1930s to the mid 1950s can then be characterized as one involving&#13;
major structural changes in the Colombian economy, in particular&#13;
in the shift from a predominantly agricultural rural economy to&#13;
an urban based increaLsingly industrial and service economy. These&#13;
structural changes continued apace until the mid 1960s but the&#13;
later period witnessed dramatic increases in blue collar wages.&#13;
Berry-Urrutia hypothesize that during the later period the degree&#13;
of protected import substitution may have decreased and that small&#13;
scale competitive enterprises may have become more successful.&#13;
The rapid expansion of primary education in the 1950s may have&#13;
also contributed to higher average worker skill levels. The later&#13;
period between the mid 1950s and mid 1960s was one of slower&#13;
economic growth and may be regarded as a period of consolidation.&#13;
That lower skilled workers' incomes rose at high rates is surpris-&#13;
ing since rural-urban migration continued at high rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
Since the mid 1960s Colombia has had a relatively high&#13;
and sustained real rate of growth of g.n.p. (about 5.5. percent&#13;
a year) but it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the&#13;
trend of the distribution of income from the available data. With&#13;
declines in rates of trtility and the progressively smaller proportion&#13;
of people left in the rural areas, the rate of rural-urban migration&#13;
and the rate of urbanization have slowed down. With the coffee boom&#13;
and the "success" of the drug trade, it may be that incomes of rural&#13;
unskilled workers have been rising -- and consequently those of urban&#13;
workers as well. As has been shown elsewhere,-/ it is clear that&#13;
between 1973 and 1978 the earnings of the most unskilled categories of&#13;
the urban labor force have indeed been increasing at relatively high&#13;
rates. It is possible that a slow down in urbanization rates has begun&#13;
to improve the overall distribution of income.&#13;
2.2  The Distribution of Income in Bogota and Cali 1973 - 1978&#13;
Unlike most other studies of income distribution which usually take&#13;
a country as the unit of observation this study is mainly concerned with&#13;
the urban income distribution as evidenced from data available from&#13;
Bogota and Cali in Colombia. Table 2(A) gives shares of income for&#13;
Bogota households ranked by household income for different years. The&#13;
evidence is mixed but there is some indication that the distribution of&#13;
income may have improved during this period. As has been documented&#13;
1/ Mohan, Wagner and Garcia (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
elsewhere I/ the key problem in comparing estimates from different&#13;
years is that the overall coverage of income is different in different&#13;
surveys. The 1973 census seemed to have covered only about 50 percent&#13;
of total personal income while the 1978 survey may have covered as&#13;
much as 90 percent. It is, however, difficult to find out whether the&#13;
undercoverage is consistent across income groups or if it is skewed&#13;
towards particular groups.   The evidence is conflicting.   An examination-/&#13;
of the labour earningys of the lowest skilled occupational categories&#13;
suggests that the census may have covered the earnings of poor male&#13;
workers well.   It does appear, however, that many working females were&#13;
not captured by the census. The participation rates of women in the&#13;
census are substantially lower in 1973 than in other years. If it is&#13;
the case that this under-coverage is greater for women in the lower&#13;
income households then the income coverage of these households would&#13;
be lower as compared with the richer groups. Since we know that&#13;
there is substantial undercoverage over all, it is probably the case&#13;
that the under coverage at the low end because of the neglect of some&#13;
female workers does not cause atypical under-coverage of income among&#13;
those households. Moreover, participation rates at the low income end&#13;
are low anyway.&#13;
Table 2 shows the shares of income received by selected&#13;
decile groups. It reflects the striking inequality that exists in&#13;
Colombia.    The income share of the bottom 40 percent of households&#13;
1/ See Mohan, Wagner and Garcia (1981)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
is less than half of the share received by the top 5 percent.&#13;
Even in 1978, when the income coverage is estimated to over 90&#13;
percent, it appeared that there was substantial under-coverage&#13;
of income from capital. This income is likely to accrue to the&#13;
richer households. Consequently, the actual distribution might be&#13;
even worse than that apparent from Table 2.    The poor have, however,&#13;
gained from economic growth at least proportionately if not at somewhat&#13;
higher rates than the rich. The picture is quite similar for Cali.&#13;
There appears to be a slight worsening between 1977 and 1978 but&#13;
it is difficult to distinguish changes due to sample errors from&#13;
real changes. -That there may have been real changes would be supported&#13;
by the fact that the worsening seems to be very similar for both cities.&#13;
Table 2(B) gives similar results but here individuals are ranked&#13;
by household income per capita (HINCAP). As shown by Datta and&#13;
Meerman (1980) the rankings of particular individuals change substantially&#13;
when ranked by HINCAP as opposed to household income (HHY), but the overall&#13;
result does not. The particular rankings are clearly important when the&#13;
aim is to find out the characteristics of the poor-/ or of the rich in&#13;
order to design any policies aimed at poverty alleviation. The distri-&#13;
bution itself does not appear to be different. There seems to be overall&#13;
improvement between 1973 and 1978 but, again, there is a suggestion of&#13;
worsening after 1977.&#13;

Tables 3 and 4 present various inequality indices for all the&#13;
years for Bogota and Cali respectively. The results are surprisingly&#13;
consistent over different income concepts, different ranking procedures&#13;
and over the two cities. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0.57 to 0.50&#13;
and Theil index from 0.68 to 0.44. The distribution of households&#13;
appears to be worse if ranked by household income per capita rather than&#13;
household income it itself. A similar result was obtained by Anand (1982)&#13;
for Malaysia as a whole but he had found that the plotted Lorenz&#13;
curves for the two distributions (Households by HHY and Households by&#13;
HINCAP) intersected each other. He therefore concluded that the HINCAP&#13;
distribution could not be said to be unambiguously worse and that the&#13;
use of different indices could produce different results. Here it&#13;
may be noted that all the indices used yield higher inequality of households&#13;
when ranked by HINCAP. This implies that even though households&#13;
with higher incomes tend to be of larger size, the large size is not&#13;
compensating enough and the distribution of HINCAP becomes worse than HHY&#13;
because of the reordering of households. Since HINCAP is a better&#13;
measure of welfare than HHY (as argued by Anand (1980), among others)&#13;
the inequality in HINCAP is the more relevant indicator of disparities&#13;
in welfare. If we are concerned with the welfare of individuals, rather&#13;
than households, then the ranking of individuals by HINCAP is the one of&#13;
greater interest. The results in Table 3b are as might be expected.&#13;
The inequality is somewhat less than for households ranked by HINCAP&#13;
but it is worse than hoseholds ranked by HHY. As was shown in Mohan (1980),&#13;
household income increases with household size but HINCAP decreases.&#13;

The increase in income earners does not compensate adequately for the&#13;
increase in dependents -- on average. Nonetheless, these results are&#13;
reassuring from a methodological point of view. The level of inequality&#13;
deduced from either of these income concepts and ranking criteria gives&#13;
somewhat similar results. Moreover, the changes over different years&#13;
and different income concepts are also consistent for the different&#13;
indices. Allshow an improvement between 1973 and 1977 and slight&#13;
worsening between 1977 and 1978.&#13;
Table 4 gives the comparable results for Cali but reports&#13;
the Gini and Theil indices only. The conclusions are the same as&#13;
for Bogota but note that there is less overall inequality in Cali.&#13;
One would expect that a larger city has more higher paid specialized&#13;
professionals as well as a larger number of people with high non-labour&#13;
income residing in it. As mentioned earlier, the coverage of non-labour&#13;
income is not good in all the sources of data considered, hence the&#13;
former reason is regarded as the more likely explanation. This is&#13;
corroborated by the analysis of the distribution of labour earnings in&#13;
Section IV.&#13;
One technical detail about the computation of inequality indices&#13;
is worth a mention here. The usual method for calculating inequality&#13;
indices is to group the population in quantiles and then to use the&#13;
resulting piecewise linear Lorenz curve for calculating the relevant&#13;
indices. Usually data on income distribution are available in one of&#13;
two formats: either income shares of different quantile groups or&#13;

population (or household) group falling within specified income ranges.&#13;
An approximation of the Lorenz curve is obtained from either of these&#13;
two kinds of data. The essential point is that data are usually&#13;
available in a form such that only a small number (10 to 20) of&#13;
observations can be plotted on the Lorenz curve. A novel feature&#13;
of this study is that income data were available for individual&#13;
households from as many as four different surveys, with one of them&#13;
being a census sample. It is therefore of interest to find out the&#13;
nature of error involved when as many as 3000 available observations&#13;
on income are grouped into 10 to 20 quantile groups.    The program&#13;
EQUALISE (described in Appendix III) provides for flexibility in&#13;
the number of observations used on the Lorenz curve.&#13;
It is expensive to utilize all the information available&#13;
from a sample survey: all observations need to be ranked for an index&#13;
to be computed. Typically, then, quantile averages are taken and the&#13;
relevant indices calculated.    Table 5 gives some idea of the error&#13;
involved in using 20 quantiles rather than all observations.    As would&#13;
be expected, inequality is slightly understated by the use of quantiles.&#13;
The Gini coefficient and the standard deviation of logarithms appear&#13;
to be relatively insensitive to the number of observations used.&#13;
Clearly, the coefficient of variation is affected significantly by&#13;
outliers. The Theil index and the Atkinson index are also affected&#13;
but not as much. It is difficult to find the optimal level of aggregation&#13;
but Table 5 indicates that the errors caused by the use of 20 quantiles&#13;
are probably tolerable for most purposes.&#13;

In summary, the levels of overall inequality found in Bogota and&#13;
Cali are not substantially different from earlier estimates reported&#13;
in the last section. There is no striking move towards greater&#13;
equality though there do appear to be some tendencies toward slight&#13;
improvement. The distribution of income in Cali is somewhat better&#13;
than in Bogota. The use of different indices, nor of different income&#13;
concepts and nor of different rankings causes any changes in these&#13;
broad conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME&#13;
The last section demonstrated the great degree of inequality&#13;
that exists in Bogota and Cali. The issue being addressed now is: how&#13;
are these incomes distributed across space within these cities and are&#13;
there any discernible trends in spatial inequality? The earlier papers-/&#13;
have established descriptively that both Bogota and Cali exhibit very&#13;
distinct patterns of income segregation by space. It was shown that&#13;
the ratio between mean incomes in different zones of the city could be&#13;
as much as 1 to 6: means being taken over relatively large zones. This&#13;
kind of spatial disparity in incomes is even unusual between the different&#13;
regions of a country (though it exists in Colombia itself as documented&#13;
by Fields and Schultz (1977)). There is very little information of this&#13;
type for other cities so it is difficult to say if such a pattern of&#13;
income differentiation within a city is unusual. Merely observing&#13;
differences between means of different populations can be misleading,&#13;
however, and it is therefore necessary to examine the full distributions.&#13;
Discussing the extent of spatial inequality within a city is&#13;
difficult because there are no natural units for analysis. Unlike the&#13;
world, which can be divided into countries, or a country which can be&#13;
divided into states, there are no natural divisions within a city. In&#13;
the U.S. much discussion is conducted by contrasting the characteristics&#13;
of central cities with suburbs - but even in this case, there is no natural&#13;
definition of what constitutes a central city. It is clear then that&#13;
1/ Mohan (1980, 1981), Mohan and Hartline (1980), Mohan, Wagner and&#13;
Garcia (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

any division of a city would be arbitrary but we need to find a&#13;
zonification system which is convenient for analysis.&#13;
Two geometric patterns suggests themselves as possible&#13;
methods of zonification. For a circular city, we can either have rings,&#13;
or radial sectors. In the U.S., for example, suburbs are often&#13;
considered to be quite distinct from the central city. Urban economic&#13;
theory-/ also suggests that under certain assumptions the poorest&#13;
would be expected to locate themselves in the centre and incomes&#13;
would increase as one proceeds outwards from the centre. In such a&#13;
case it would be useful to divide the city into rings and to study&#13;
the spatial distribution of income in terms of these rings. The&#13;
other obvious pattern, that of radial sectors was suggested by Homer Hoyt&#13;
(1939, 1966) among others. The city can be divided into pie slices&#13;
and the distribution of income studied in terms of these divisions.&#13;
He had traced the historical development of a large number of North&#13;
American cities         and concluded that income groups tended to&#13;
locate themselves ne!ar like groups. Hence, if the rich historically&#13;
located themselves in one section of the city, the development of the&#13;
city took place such that the rich continued to locate themselves in&#13;
the same direction as the city continued to expand. Such a historical&#13;
process resulted in different pie slices or radial sectors emerging&#13;
with different characteristics. Peter Amato (1968) focused on the&#13;
elite of Bogota and showed how they have tended to locate predominantly&#13;
in the North of Bogota and have continued to move in that direction.&#13;

Maps (1) and (2)illustrate the geography of Bogota and&#13;
Cali and the spatial disaggregation system is described in Appendix&#13;
(ii ). Both the cities can be divided conveniently into semi-circular&#13;
rings and radial sectors. There is no good reason why Bogota has been&#13;
divided into eight radial sectors and six rings except that the DANE&#13;
geo-coding system makes these numbers the obvious choices. The rings&#13;
and sectors are constituted from smaller units - comunas - of which there&#13;
are 38 in Bogota and 25 in Cali. The discussion of spatial inequality&#13;
is then conducted in terms of these geographical divisions which are&#13;
particular to these cities but the principle can be generalized to other&#13;
cities.&#13;
Tables 6a and 6b describe the distribution of mean incomes and&#13;
of the population in Bogota and Cali by radial sectors from 1973 to 1978.&#13;
That the proportions of population in each sector are similar in all the&#13;
years gives confidence in the sample distribution of the household surveys.&#13;
The sample frame of the 1978 sample was updated and the distribution&#13;
indicates that sector 8 may have gained in terms of population over the period&#13;
1973 to 1978. The 1975 and 1977 surveys were samples drawn from the same&#13;
basic sample frame so no conclusions can be drawn from them on any change&#13;
in the spatial distribution of population. The mean household income per&#13;
capita is given in terms of the overall mean. The multiples remain broadly&#13;
similar over the whole time period. HINCAP of the poorest sector - sector&#13;
2 in the south of the city - is about a fifth or sixth of the richest -&#13;
sector 8 in the north of the city. With the exception of sector 6, mean&#13;
incomes increase as one moves clockwise from the South of Bogota toward&#13;

the north. (Sector 1 is the city center). The poor sectors 2, 3, and 6&#13;
account for almost 65 percent of the total population. There is no notice-&#13;
able trend toward a narrowing of the differences in mean income between&#13;
the sectors. In Cali, the data indicate that some changes might be taking&#13;
place in that city. First, the division there seems to be more between the&#13;
Eastern and Western parts of the city: the Eastern sectors, 3, 4 and 5&#13;
being relatively poorer than the Western sectors 2, 6, 7. Mean HINCAP&#13;
in the poorest sector is about a sixth as much as the richest in 1973&#13;
and about a quarter in 1974. The multiples are not as stable across time&#13;
as in Bogota: this may be because of smaller sample sizes and hence larger&#13;
sample errors. It does appear, though, that sector 2 is becoming relatively&#13;
less rich. If the changes in sector 1 results are not caused by sampling&#13;
errors, they indicate that the city center may be gaining higher income&#13;
people.&#13;
These patterns had been established in Mohan (1980) for Bogota.&#13;
The question then is how much is being hidden behind the means. Are there&#13;
large variances around these means or do the means capture the essence of&#13;
the differing characteristics of these sectors.    Section 1  has laid out the&#13;
decomposition method followed in this study to investigate the spatial&#13;
distribution of income. To recapitulate, the variance in incomes is being&#13;
decomposed into two parts. Households or people are being grouped by&#13;
sectors or rings. Overall inequality in the city is then decomposed into&#13;
within group and between group contributions. The within group contribution&#13;
is essentially a weighted average of the indices of inequality within each&#13;
group and the between group contribution is a measure of the differences in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the means appropriately weighted by the group population for log variance&#13;
ana group snares in income for tne TLheil index.&#13;
In both Bogota and Cali, the radial sectors are more distinct&#13;
in terms of income patterns than the rings. This is confirmed in Table 7.&#13;
Households are ranked by both household income as well as household income&#13;
per capita. Two inequality indices are decomposed: the Theil index-&#13;
and log variance. For Bogota more than a quarter of overall inequality as&#13;
measured by the Theil index may be attributed to space; and about 20&#13;
percent as measured by log variance. The spatial contributions are somewhat&#13;
lower for Cali. The between group contribution is very small when house-&#13;
holds are grouped by rings. This finding confirms systematically earlier&#13;
conjectures that the sectors are far more distinct in characteristics&#13;
than rings in Bogota and Cali. Note that the between group contribution&#13;
of rings increases substantially when households are ranked by HINCAP:&#13;
this is due to the fact that the average household size is larger in the&#13;
periphery than in the center (Mohan,1980 ) and hence the household income&#13;
per capita differences are greater between the rings than total household&#13;
income. The between group contribution can be regarded as an index of&#13;
spatial inequality in incomes: it may be termed an index of spatial income&#13;
segregation (ISIS). Table 7 also shows ISIS for individuals ranked by&#13;
HINCAP as well as workers ranked by labor earnings. The ISIS for workers&#13;
is substantially lower than for households and for individuals. This finding&#13;
indicates that some of the spatial differences are due to locational differ-&#13;
ences arising from differences in household characteristics rather than&#13;
spatial differences in the labor market.&#13;

Tables 8a and 8b give the pattern of income inequality across&#13;
and within radial sectors in Bogota and Cali respectively. The Theil&#13;
index- /is shown for each sector as well as for the city as a whole. The&#13;
two tables reveal quite interesting trends. First, the level of inequality&#13;
within each sector is less than overall inequality. Second, the city&#13;
center (sector 1) is the most heterogeneous in both the cities. Third,&#13;
the poorest sectors (sector 2 in Bogota and sector 4 in Cali) show low&#13;
indexes of inequality. Fourth, the richest sectors, sector 8 in Bogota&#13;
and sector 2 in Cali are also tending to show low indexes of inequality.&#13;
In Bogota there is a clear indication that ISIS is increasing over time&#13;
from about 22 percent in 1973 to 27 percent in 1978 (with lower figures in&#13;
intervening years). The last line in both the tables shows the ISIS&#13;
if comunas are used as the spatial division. The between group contribution&#13;
rises to 35 to 40 percent indicating that comunas are relatively homogeneous&#13;
units: between comuna differences account for almost 40 percent of the&#13;
overall inequality. ISIS for these also increases over time.&#13;
These results indicate strongly that the pattern of income&#13;
segregation in Bogota is tending to get worse with time: there is&#13;
certainly no evidence of the spatial disparities reducing. The last section&#13;
showed that overall there is little evidence of increasing inequality,&#13;
however. If spatial segregation of income groups has long term deleterious&#13;
effects on the chances of the poor in the labor market as suggested in&#13;
Mohan (1981), then it is a cause for concern that Bogota is being&#13;

log variance as the inequality index.&#13;

increasingly segregated by income. To the extent that policy-makers&#13;
are relatively richer, increasing segregation can have the longer term&#13;
effect of making them oblivious to the conditions of the poor in the city.&#13;
Job opportunities are generally greater in the richer areas than in poorer&#13;
areas. Increasing segregation might then also mean increasing average&#13;
commutes for the poor who work in the richer areas of town. If such trends&#13;
continue dualism will become a reality.&#13;
The methods employed in analyzing the spatial distribution of&#13;
income can be extended to other cities in order to find out if Bogota and&#13;
Cali are atypical in their degree of income segregation. If such studies&#13;
are carried out in many cities it may also be possible to get at the&#13;
reasons behind higher and lower levels of spatial differentiation between&#13;
cities.&#13;

IV. THE DECOMPOSITION OF LABOUR EARNINGS&#13;
The previous sections have traced the inequality in incomes in&#13;
Bogota and Cali using households as units of observation. It has been&#13;
argued that of the income concepts used, the household income per capita&#13;
(HINCAP) is the best measure of welfare for the household and for the&#13;
individual.    Indices of inequality have been computed for different income&#13;
concepts and different criteria of ranking. These calculations are&#13;
essentially of a descriptive nature: they are meant to give an idea of the&#13;
extent of inequality prevailing among households and individuals but they&#13;
are not useful in gaining insights into the causes of inequality. The only&#13;
decompositions attempted of the inequality measures were by location of&#13;
residence: the between group contribution varied between 20 to 25 percent&#13;
of the total inequality. In other words, spatial inequality contributed&#13;
about a quarter of the total inequality in Bogota and Cali.&#13;
This section takes the worker as the unit of observation and&#13;
investigates the distribution of labor earnings. The greater part of the&#13;
earnings of households comes from labor earnings. Hence the decomposition of&#13;
labor earnings is useful in providing insights into the sources of inequality&#13;
in incomes across households and individuals. The other sources of inequality&#13;
between households is the difference in participation rates and in differences&#13;
in household size. Thus, if participation rates are correlated with the&#13;
different groups of people being considered for decompsition analysis, it&#13;
is likely that the between group contribution to inequality in labour earnings&#13;
would be less than for household income per capita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
The work presented in this section complements the analysis of&#13;
earnings functions in Mohan (1981).    There, the determinants of labor&#13;
earnings are investigated systematically and education and years of&#13;
experience are found to be the key determinants of the variance in earnings.&#13;
The results in this section confirm those findings, but in addition, give&#13;
further insights into the distribution of earnings within and between groups.&#13;
4.1 The Spatial Distribution of Personal Earnings&#13;
Tables 9a and 9b present the within sector and between sector&#13;
indices of inequality in labor earnings in Bogota and Cali respectively.&#13;
As might be expected the pattern is broadly similar to the distribution of&#13;
household income and of HINCAP but with some differences. By and large, in&#13;
Bogota the poorer sectors (1, 2 and 3) have lower levels of inequality than the&#13;
richer sectors (7 and 8). Another way of describing the same phenomenon is to say&#13;
that the richer sectors have poor people as well as many rich people while&#13;
the poorer sectors have few rich people living there. There is about a&#13;
1 to 4 ratio between the mean earnings in the poorest sector (2) and in the&#13;
richest sector (8). The ratio was about 1 to 5 for HINCAP. Thus the spatial&#13;
disparities are less pronounced for labor earnings than for HINCAP as&#13;
measured by the differesnces between means. The between-group contribution&#13;
to the Theil index is also lower for labor earnings than for HINCAP. It is&#13;
clear then that the extent of spatial disparity in incomes in Bogota is not&#13;
caused solely by the maldistribution of labor earnings by location of&#13;
residence. The results from the earnings functions analysis in Mohan (1981)&#13;
indicated that the location of residence (acting as a proxy for other&#13;
unmeasured characterisAtics) was a significant determinant of labor earnings&#13;
but did not contribute much in magnitude to the explanation of log variance,&#13;
after controlling for other factors. Appendix Tables A.3 and A.4 give the&#13;

analysis information as in Table 9 but using log variance as the index: the&#13;
spatial contribution is smaller than for the Theil index since the log&#13;
variance is more sensitive to low incomes. These results are naturally con-&#13;
sistent with the earnings function estimates.&#13;
That the between sector contribution to inequality is lower for&#13;
labor earnings indicates that dependency ratios are higher among the house-&#13;
holds in the poorer sectors. The spatial maldistribution of earnings is&#13;
then compounded by either larger families or lower participation rates or&#13;
higher unemployment rates. Any of these would produce higher dependency&#13;
ratios. Cause and effect here is not easy to disentangle: do the presence&#13;
of children inhibit poorer women from working because of child care&#13;
responsibilities? Are they out of the labor force or are they unemployed&#13;
because they can only take part time jobs with less rigid work patterns?&#13;
The spatial concern is important in this respect. If it is the case, as is&#13;
being demonstrated in Bogota, that large areas of the city -- the South --&#13;
have predominantly low income people, then it is likely that those areas&#13;
have comparatively fewer jobs per resident population than the richer areas.&#13;
The purchasing power in these areas is simply much lower. It is certainly&#13;
a fact (as demonstrated in Mohan (1980)    that there is a great amount of&#13;
out commuting from the poorer sectors to the richer sectors but very little&#13;
in reverse. It is also true, however, that unemployment rates as well as&#13;
participation rates do not differ too much between sectors -- though there&#13;
are differences whose significance is difficult to assess statistically.&#13;
That large differences do not exist does not mean that the poorer people&#13;
would not have higher participation rates and therefore bg better off&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

were these large spatial disparities not there. These questions&#13;
cannot be answered by the evidence at hand: only suggestive implications&#13;
can be drawn.&#13;
The Theil index decreased between 1973 and 1978 from 0.38&#13;
to 0.27 in Sector 2 and 0.68 to 0.45 in Sector 8. Thus both the&#13;
poorest and richest sectors are getting more homogeneous and therefore&#13;
more distinct from each other over time. Indeed, declines in in-&#13;
equality are observed in all the sectors although the overall index&#13;
of inequality increased between 1975 and 1978. In earlier years&#13;
the Theil index was greater for some sectors than the overall index:&#13;
in 1978 within sector inequality in all sectors is lower than overall&#13;
inequality in the city. Similar trends are observed in Cali though&#13;
the spatial disparity is somewhat less pronounced there. The ratio&#13;
of mean earnings in the poorest sector (4) to those in the richest&#13;
sector (2) is less than 1 to 3 in Cali.   There is   clearer indication&#13;
that overall inequality has been declining in that city.&#13;
One must therefore conclude from these data that the spatial&#13;
disparities are getting more pronounced in both these cities in terms&#13;
of both labour earnings distributions as well as household income&#13;
and household income per capita. If the spatial separation of income&#13;
groups can be seen aLs harmful for the opportunities in the future for&#13;
the poor as well as for social cohesion in the present, then these&#13;
findings are truly a cause for concern.&#13;
4.2 The Decomposition of Labour Earnings According to Various&#13;
Personal Characteristics&#13;
The distribution of labour earnings is dissected further&#13;
according to conventional classifications. Between group and within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
group contributions are computed by age, education, employment status,&#13;
occupation, industry of activity and size of firm. These calculations&#13;
merely complement the earnings functions work but also give a better&#13;
sense of the distributions within these various categories.&#13;
Table 10 summarizes the decomposition of the distribution&#13;
of labour earnings according to the various classifications utilized&#13;
The succeeding pages give the details of the classifications and of&#13;
the individual distributions. It is clear at a glance that the&#13;
between group contributions are lower for Cali than for Bogota for&#13;
all the classifications. A smaller city has a somewhat less variegated&#13;
or heterogeneous labour market. Occupations are, perhaps, less&#13;
specialized at the top end. The highest financial and governmental&#13;
functions are typically in the political capital of a country or in&#13;
the key business center: Bogota serving as both in the case of&#13;
Colombia. It has been observed earlier that overall inequality is&#13;
also lower in Cali.&#13;
Age and Education&#13;
It is somewhat surprising that age group differences contribute&#13;
only about 9 to 11 percent to total inequality in labour earnings.&#13;
The implication is that for the majority of workers, their age-earnings&#13;
profiles are pretty flat.   As was shown in Mohan (1980)    the age&#13;
earnings profiles are very steep for higher educated people but&#13;
much less for the less educated. Table 12 shows that almost half&#13;
of the labour force in Bogota still has only primary education or less.&#13;
Moreover, Table 11   shows that after     age 25 the overall age-&#13;
earnings profile is rather flat. At the same time, inequality within&#13;

age groups increases consistently along with age except for the over 65s.&#13;
This is true for both Bogota and Cali. Note that earnings are very&#13;
egalitarian in the young age group 15-24: The disparities increase&#13;
with age as those with more education increase their earnings - along&#13;
with others who are successful as well - while the rest have to live&#13;
with almost the same earnings for most of their lives. This is&#13;
of great importance for the study of life-cycle effects on poverty&#13;
as has been shown in Mohan and Hartline (1980) and Mohan, Garcia&#13;
and Wagner (1981).  Those who have relatively flat age-earnings&#13;
profiles experience decreases in their real household income per&#13;
capita as the process of family formation takes place and there are&#13;
more mouths to feed. Many studies show a relatively higher incidence&#13;
of malnutrition among children: flat age earnings profiles would be&#13;
one of the key causes for such a phenomenon.&#13;
The differences in educational achievements account for 32&#13;
to 38 percent of the civerall inequality in Bogota and about 22 to 27&#13;
percent in Cali. Only 4 groups are utilized: those with no education,&#13;
any primary, any secondary and any higher education. The information&#13;
in Table 12 is of great interest. First, clearly Bogota has a much&#13;
larger proportion of the labour force with higher education. The&#13;
capital aity presumably attracts - has jobs for - the more highly&#13;
educated. This partly accounts for the relatively higher level of&#13;
inequality in Bogota. Second, the highest level of inequality is&#13;
found among the secondary level educated group. Clearly, those who&#13;

receive higher education have uniformly high incomes and those with&#13;
only primary, uniformly low incomes. Much of the unexplained&#13;
variance in earnings must be among the secondary level educated&#13;
workers. They have the potential for higher earnings: some make&#13;
it but many do not. Third, because of the presence of more&#13;
higher educated workers the mean earnings in Bogota are rather higher&#13;
than those in Cali aLnd even the mean of the secondary educated is&#13;
less than the overall mean. The between group contribution enumerated&#13;
above is rather large and attests to the importance of education in&#13;
determining earnings and earnings potential.&#13;
Employment Status&#13;
Table 13 gives the decomposition of labour earnings according&#13;
to groups of workers by employment status. Two classifications&#13;
were attempted. The first with Qnly 3 groups merely distinguished&#13;
between all employees, owners or bosses and the self-employed.&#13;
The second classification broke down the employees category into blue&#13;
collar workers, white collar workers, domestic workers and "non-&#13;
remunerated". The greatest extent of inequality is found among the&#13;
self-employed. Skills in entrepreneurship, the exercise of initiative&#13;
and other unmeasured characteristics are likely to be important within&#13;
this group: some are quite poor while others can be very well off.&#13;
The Theil index for inequality within this group is higher than the&#13;
index for all the workers taken together. It is also of interest&#13;
that the lower skilled group - blue collar workers and domestic&#13;
1/&#13;
workers - have the lowest within group index./ The labour market&#13;
1/  Ignore "unremunerated workers" as a misclassified and small category.&#13;

for these categories must be homogeneous as well as competitive. These&#13;
low paid groups comprise almost 30 percent of the labour force.&#13;
Owners and bosses eanaings are also distributed in a relatively&#13;
egalitarian fashion: The Theil index is only about 0.34 to 0.35. This&#13;
is a bit surprising since one would expect that there would be many small&#13;
relatively poor owners as well as rich ones. The between group contribution&#13;
for the first classification is only about 10 percent while for the second&#13;
it is about 20 percent: the latter would therefore suggest that an&#13;
expansion of categoriess is worth examination.&#13;
Occupational Status&#13;
Occupational differences account for about 33 to 40 percent&#13;
in the inequality in earnings in Bogota and 17 to 25 in Cali.&#13;
The between group contribution does not increase much if one changes&#13;
the classification from the 1 digit level (7 categories) to more&#13;
using 13 categories. The one-digit level is therefore a fairly&#13;
adequate level of disaggregation for occupations. Ignoring&#13;
agricultural workers, the level of inequality within occupations&#13;
is substantially lower than the overall inequality except for sales&#13;
workers, as shown in Table 14. Appendix Table A.5 gives the&#13;
analogous information for the more dissaggregated classification&#13;
scheme. Even when sales workers are separated into sales managers&#13;
and others the indiex of inequality does not decrease appreciably.&#13;
There is clearly a high variance of earnings among sales establish-&#13;
ments and among the people who work in these establishments - a&#13;

finding consistent with the high level of inequality found among&#13;
the self-employed since many of the latter are likely to be engaged&#13;
in trade. It is quite surprising to find that the large category&#13;
comprising productiorL workers (35 to 40 percent of the labour&#13;
force) is quite homogeneous with a Theil index of only about 0.2&#13;
in Bogota, and somewhLat higher in Cali. Within white collar&#13;
occupations also - clerks and typists and the administrators and&#13;
managers - the earnings distribution seems to be in a relatively&#13;
narrow band. Almost all the within occupation contributions to&#13;
inequality are higher for Cali. The evidence from these data is&#13;
clearly that exdept for sales, choice of occupation is very&#13;
important as a predictor of potential earnings: indeed, the&#13;
between group contribution of occupational categories to income&#13;
inequality is of the same order of magnitude as that of education.&#13;
Industry of Activity&#13;
Tne industry of activity is a far less interesting classification&#13;
of workers from the viewpoint of income inequality. The one digit level of&#13;
classification yields only a 4 to 5 percent between group contribution to&#13;
inequality: essential.Ly negligible. When the manufacturing industries&#13;
are disaggregated and 20 industrial categories are used the between&#13;
group contribution increases to 11 to 15 percent. Nonetheless, as&#13;
shown iil Table 15 every iladustridl category ubv'iuOuly has a ra-iier&#13;
heterogeneous composition of workers. It is the only relatively&#13;
small category of utilities which has a low Theil index of between&#13;

0.2   and 0.25.      Construction     and transport&#13;
and communication are the other two industrial categories which&#13;
are somewhat homogeneous. Appendix Table A.6. gives the same&#13;
information for the expanded number of industrial categories - (20).&#13;
Essentially, the menufacturing categories have been dissggregated&#13;
As might be expectetd, the within group contributions to inequality&#13;
decrease and the between group contribution rises. These results&#13;
suggest that, overall, industrial categories cannot be regarded&#13;
as a very useful classification in the study of inequality in&#13;
labour earnings. Occupational categories are more distinct.&#13;
Segmentation is often sought in the labour market between industries:&#13;
it would appear that in Bogota and Cali all industries are quite&#13;
heterogeneous in that within industry inequality is almost as great&#13;
the overall inequality for most industries.&#13;
Size of Firm&#13;
The last decomposition attempted was by categories of firm&#13;
size since it is often suggested that the labour market is segmented&#13;
according to firm size. It is argued that the protected sector consists&#13;
of the larger firms and, because they pay considerably higher wages,&#13;
much of the inequality observed in urban areas is due to the&#13;
existence of this protected sector. Six categories of firm size are&#13;
distinguished in Table 16: 1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-25, 25 to 100 and 100+.&#13;
The between group contribution to inequality is only about 7 to&#13;
12 percent -- a proportion lower than that gound for spatial&#13;
disparity in earnings. As many as 45 to 50 percent of the workers&#13;

in Bogota and Cali work in firms of less than 5 people. The mean&#13;
earnings of workers in single employee establishments -- presumably&#13;
mostly self-employed service and trade activities -- are considerably&#13;
lower than the other categories. There is not much difference between&#13;
the means beyond the size of 10. Moreover, within category levels&#13;
of inequality are not very different from the largest category: firms&#13;
employing over 100 people. The Theil index for them is about 0.34 to 0.38.&#13;
The mean level of earnings is somewhat higher and they are distributed&#13;
within a relatively narrower band. But the overall evidence, consistent&#13;
with the results from the earnings functions, is that firm size is&#13;
not an important feature of the labour market in Bogota and Cali.&#13;
The mean levels are not very different between categories, the&#13;
between group contribution is low, and the within group contributions&#13;
are not very different from the overall level of inequality.&#13;

4.3. Summary&#13;
This section has probed the distribution of labour earnings in a&#13;
detailed manner. An analysis of the determinants of labour earnings has been&#13;
reported elsewhere (Mohan, 1981) and the decomposition of earnings is merely&#13;
another method of looking at the labour market. Not surprisingly, the results&#13;
are consistent with those found in the earlier paper.&#13;
The overall spatial inequality in labour earnings was found to be&#13;
less than that for HINCAP. This is probably because of higher dependency&#13;
rates for the households in the poorer parts of the city. The spatial&#13;
maldistribution of earnings is then compounded by the existence of either&#13;
larger families, lower participation rates or higher unemployment rates - to&#13;
produce a worse distribution of HINCAP. It was also found that the inequality&#13;
in earnings within sectors has been decreasing consistently over time while&#13;
that between sectors has been increasing. Thus the different sectors are&#13;
tending to become relatively more homogeneous. Large areas of Bogota - mainly&#13;
the South - are inhabited predominantly by poor people. Because of the&#13;
resulting low purchasing power of the area as a whole, there is therefore also&#13;
lower demand for labour. There are comparatively fewer jobs per resident&#13;
labour as compared with the richer sectors.&#13;
The other types of categories which were found to exhibit the most&#13;
between group inequality were education groups and occupation groups. Within&#13;
group inequality was low for both higher educated people as well as lower&#13;
educated people.    The secondary educated group exhibited the greatest -&#13;
within group inequality which, moreover, was greater than the overall&#13;
inequality. The fact that between group inequality was low confirms the&#13;
relatively flat age-earnings profile that exists in Bogota as a whole because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
of the majority of people still being educated up to the primary level or&#13;
less. Naturally, since the higher educated people have relatively steep age-&#13;
earnings profile the clegree of inequality increases within age groups along&#13;
with age. Interestingly, there is very low inequality within the young age&#13;
group of 15 to 24 years.&#13;
Among occupations, production workers were the most homogeneous&#13;
while sales workers exhibited the most within group inequality. Overall, the&#13;
between group contribution was as high as about 40 percent for occupational&#13;
categories. It is somewhat surprising that production workers exhibit low&#13;
inequality as a group since one would have expected a wide variety of skill&#13;
levels within the group. Significantly, the industry of activity, as well as&#13;
the size of firm show very low between group contributions to inequality. The&#13;
labor market segmentation literature has most often focused on these two types&#13;
of categorization for identifying segmentation in the labour market. These&#13;
results would indicate that the labour market in Bogota cannot be said to be&#13;
segmented by either size of firm or by industry of activity.&#13;
The level of education and choice of occupation are clearly the most&#13;
important factors in the determination of labour earnings in Bogota and Cali&#13;
on the basis of these results. To the extent that poor education as well as&#13;
low aspirations (e.g. in the choice of education) result at least partially&#13;
from living in a poor part of the city, the increasing spatial segregation&#13;
measured by increases in the ISIS is truly a cause for concern.&#13;
The last result of interest is that the between group contribution&#13;
to inequality was consistently lower for Cali as compared with Bogota, as was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
the overall level of inequality. Clearly, a smaller city is expected to have&#13;
a much less heterogeneous and variegated labour market, and particularly at&#13;
the highest skill levels. This is evidenced by the fact that Bogota has a&#13;
higher proportion of people with higher education.&#13;

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLlUSIONS&#13;
This paper hLas attempted to document the distribution of income and&#13;
the changes therein in two fast growing cities in the developing world as part&#13;
of a larger study that seeks to explain the economic structure of cities in&#13;
poor countries. Earlier papers have given some of the same information in a&#13;
more descriptive fashion. Conjectures offerred in these papers concerning the&#13;
distribution of income and the pattern of labour earnings have been confirmed&#13;
in this paper.&#13;
Overall, there appears to be a tendency toward some improvement in&#13;
the distribution of income between 1973 and 1978 in Bogota and Cali. The&#13;
quality of the data is not robust enough to be able to state this conclusively&#13;
but such a tendency would be consistent with overall changes in the national&#13;
economy over this period. With over 60 percent of the population now already&#13;
in urban areas theres is a natural slow down in the rate of urbanization.&#13;
This has been reflected in the growth of Bogota and Cali as well.       To the&#13;
extent that such a slow down in the growth of the cities also implies a&#13;
tightening of the labour market, pushing up unskilled wages, an improvement in&#13;
the distribution of income may also be expected. Further, although over half&#13;
of the population in these cities is still educated upto only the primary&#13;
level or less there has been a continuing deepening of the educational level&#13;
of the labour force. As the inequality in educational levels declines so&#13;
should it in the distr:Lbution of earned income. The one major caveat in all&#13;
these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
observations is that if the coverage of non-labour income in all the surveys&#13;
is bad, as is suspected, some of the improvement in the distribution of income&#13;
could be illusory.&#13;
Despite any improvement in the distribution that may have occurred,&#13;
the level of inequality in the two cities remains very high and which may&#13;
possibly be among the more unequal in the world. Measured in any way - the&#13;
distribution of households ranked according to household income or by&#13;
household income per capita, or individuals by household income per capita,&#13;
earners by labour earnings, the Gini coefficient comes to be between about&#13;
0.55 and 0.50 with a tendency towards improvement over the 1973 to 1978 time&#13;
period for which data were analyzed. There is a high degree of confidence in&#13;
these results since they are robust over the different samples, different&#13;
indices, different income concepts and different ranking procedures. Overall,&#13;
there is a higher level of inequality in Bogota, as might be expected, than&#13;
the smaller city, Cali.&#13;
A special feature of this study is the calculation of ISIS - the&#13;
Index of the Spatial Income Segregation defined as the percentage between&#13;
-group contribution of spatial zones to overall inequality in a city. As had&#13;
been suggested in earlier papers, Bogota and Cali both have more distinct&#13;
radial sectors in terms of income patterns rather than rings as is the case&#13;
with North American cities. The between-group contribution is very low when&#13;
the grouping is done by rings. The ISIS in both the cities is substantially&#13;
lower for labour earnings as compared with household income per capita,&#13;
implying tht some of the inequality is due to the locational differences in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
the composition of households. The main disqueiting feature of these findings&#13;
is that ISIS appears to be increasing over time while inequality within&#13;
sectors is declining. Thus each sector is becoming more homogeneous - the&#13;
rich sectors as well as the poor ones. The city is therefore becoming more&#13;
spatially segregated by income over time.&#13;
If, as may be suspected, greater segregation by income has&#13;
deleterious effects on social welfare mainly through the operation of labour&#13;
markets the increasing spatial disparities in Bogota are truly a case for&#13;
concern. Mohan (1981) had established the location of residence as a&#13;
significant factor in the determinants of labour earnings within the city.&#13;
The between group contribution of sectors to the overall inequality in labour&#13;
earnings supports that finding. The interpretation of the location of&#13;
residence variable was as a proxy for family background, educational quality&#13;
and other similar determinants of earnings.    If the poor environmental factors&#13;
faced by a poor child are reinforced by higher segregation, then the increase&#13;
in ISIS gives major cause for concern for the distribution of earnings in the&#13;
future. It is typically the case in most cities that richer areas are much&#13;
better served by public utilities than poorer areas. If the richer and poorer&#13;
areas are mixed - as they are in many cities - then the poorer areas also&#13;
benefit from the pressures brought by the rich for good sanitation, water&#13;
supply, roads, etc. It is then likely that if very large areas, such as the&#13;
South of Bogota and East of Cali, have very few better off people then the&#13;
likelihood of neglect by public authorities increases. The quality of&#13;
schooling can be very seriously affected by such segregation since it may be&#13;
expected that both the quality of teachers as well as average quality of&#13;
students would be low.    Self-reinforcing and long term effects would then&#13;
result in terms of spatial disadvantage being suffered by the children living&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-&#13;
in these areas which would manifest itself later on in the labour market.&#13;
Although the problem of consistent zonification remains for comparisons to be&#13;
made across cities, ISIS can be used as a measure of income segregation and&#13;
could easily be applied to different cities. If the same number of quantiles&#13;
as well as the same number of zones were used the results would be quite&#13;
comparable across cities.&#13;
The decomposition of labour earnings has lent support to the earlier&#13;
work on the determinants of labour earnings. The industry of activity and the&#13;
size of firm - the variables that are often used as segmenting variables in&#13;
labour market segmentation literature - were found to contribute very little&#13;
to the overall inequality in earnings. The main variables contributing to&#13;
inequality were found to be education and occupation - which could be taken as&#13;
a proxy of skill.&#13;
Overall, Bogota was found to exhibit higher inequality than Cali as&#13;
well as higher ISIS. These are very suggestive results on the characteristics&#13;
and role of large cities as compared with smaller cities. It would seem that&#13;
a larger city can be expected to have a much more variegated and heterogeneous&#13;
labour market leading to higher inequality. It is only in the largest cities&#13;
that the highest professional and other skills can be utilized and therefore&#13;
the highest professional incomes would be found only in the larger cities.&#13;
There would then also be greater pressures, particularly in a high overall&#13;
inequality situation, for higher spatial segregation. The relatively rich&#13;
would want to live near others of like qualities and in a larger city there&#13;
would be a critical mass for them to be able to do so.&#13;

APPENDIX II&#13;
THE DATA&#13;
The City Study has assembled a data bank of existing&#13;
sources of data in Bogota and Cali, Colombia in the form of copies&#13;
of the original com':uter tapes prepared by the respective originators&#13;
of the data. All have been documented in detail by Nelson Valverde&#13;
(1978) and Y.J. Lee (1978). This study utilizes 4 of these data&#13;
sets; all originally collected by DANE.-/   The 1978 survey was&#13;
conducted jointly by the City Study and DANE.&#13;
1973 Population Census&#13;
The lasit census undertaken was in 1973 and the one&#13;
immediately preceding was in 1964. UTnfortunately the 1964 census&#13;
does not report incomes nor does it have intra-city spatial detail.&#13;
There has been wide skepticism concerning the coverage of the 1973&#13;
census -/ but Potter and OrdoRez (1976) concluded after a careful&#13;
demographic analysis that the information they analyzed from the&#13;
advance sample appeared to be of good quality, at least in&#13;
relation to previous censuses. They estimated that the overall under-&#13;
enumeration for Colombia as a whole was probably about 7 percent.&#13;
1/  DANE:  Departamento Adminsitrativo Nacional de Estadistica&#13;
(National Statistical Agency, Colombia).&#13;
2/  One example of such skepticism is Lubell and McCallum (1978)&#13;
(p. 126) who regard the Bogota 1973 results as "simply not&#13;
useable" and therefore place no reliance on the census. For&#13;
their calculations and projections they prefer the 1972 Urban&#13;
Development Study Household Survey covering 4675 households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-&#13;
The public use tape provided by DANE is a 4% sample of households. However,&#13;
for Bogota the tape contains all households living in the buildings&#13;
which happen to have the households in the 4% sample. We have used the&#13;
whole sample for tabulations in this paper but the sample has been&#13;
expanded to reflect the size of the city accounting for estimated under-&#13;
numeration    Since this study is particularly concerned with the spatial&#13;
distributions within the city, the sample was expanded appropriately to&#13;
be representative of the city. Details of this methodology have been given&#13;
in Appendix (3) of Mohan (1980).&#13;
The census contains information on dwelling characteristics,&#13;
household characteristics, demographic information on all individuals,&#13;
labor force information for workers and fertility information on&#13;
females. While I cannot comment on its coverage the overall quality of&#13;
the information in the sample appears to be good and I am therefore in&#13;
agreement with Potter and OrdoEez (1976). Non-responses appear to be&#13;
distributed randomly; the only obvious bias is that single member&#13;
households predominate in the no information categories in income and&#13;
labor force information. One of the distinguishing features of this&#13;
data set which makes it very useful for us is that the location of&#13;
respondents is coded down to the block (manzana) of residence in the&#13;
city. The following section will describe the consistent geo-coding&#13;
system used by DANE in all of its work. The income was obtained from&#13;
only one question "what was your income from all sources last month?"&#13;
Only about 12 percent of the sample did not report income information--&#13;
a proportion which compares well with non-responses in the U.S. census.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91 -&#13;
Appendix (2) of Mohan (1980) reported the results of an estimation&#13;
of the income coverage of the 1973 census as well as the 1977 Household&#13;
Survey (see below).  A summary of the method is given in Table A.a.    It&#13;
appears that an aggregation of all incomes reported in the census amounted&#13;
to no more than 50 percent of the estimated total personal income for&#13;
Bogota. Various factors respcnsible for this under-reporting can be&#13;
enumerated:&#13;
*    12% of the people gave no income information.&#13;
*    When only one question is asked, much of the non-labor earnings&#13;
are probably not reported.&#13;
*    Income in kind, e.g. as received by domestic servants, is&#13;
probably not: reported.&#13;
*    Many earners; receive end.of the year bonuses: these are&#13;
characteristically not covered in one shot cross-section&#13;
surveys such as the census unless the question is asked&#13;
specifically.&#13;
Keeping these factors in mind it is then not surprising that the income&#13;
coverage of the census was only about 50%.-&#13;
Household Surveys&#13;
DANE has conducted a regular program of household surveys from&#13;
1970 with the main objective of collecting information on the labor force.&#13;
Since 1975 these surveys have been quarterly and are conducted alternatingly&#13;
in the four largest cities and in the seven largest cities 2/ along with&#13;
1/ This may be compared with a recent estimate of under-coverage in the&#13;
Brazil 1960 and 1970 censuses where Pfefferman and Webb (1978) estimate&#13;
that the censuses cover about 57 - 58 percent of the income. (p. 16).&#13;

an occasional national survey. We have obtained the computer tapes for&#13;
1972 (Encuesta de Hogares - Fuerza de Trabajo: EH 6-FT), 1975 (EH8E),&#13;
and 1977 (EH15). The 1972 survey was a national one and covered 6371&#13;
households of whom 1348 were in Bogota. It contains information on&#13;
housing as well as demographic and labor force characteristics. This&#13;
survey does not provide the intra-city location of the respondents.&#13;
The 1975 survey was a special one for the city of Bogota and sampled&#13;
3953 households and contains information on demographic and labor force&#13;
characteristics only. The 1977 survey was conducted in the four largest&#13;
cities and sampled 6082 households of whom 3161 households, were in&#13;
Bogota. Starting with this survey DANE has begun to use "rotational&#13;
sampling" such that 67% of dwelling units sampled remain in the next&#13;
survey and 33% are new. Both the 1975 and 1977 surveys contain the&#13;
location of residence of the respondents. The 1972 and 1975 surveys also&#13;
have firm size information on the number of employees working in each&#13;
respondents' work place. This question was not included in the 1977&#13;
sample. In carrying out these samples DANE classifies neighborhoods&#13;
into 6 socio-economic strata: 1 low-low, 2 low, 3 medium low, 4 medium,&#13;
5 medium high and 6 high. At the conclusion of a survey weights are&#13;
assigned to each of these strata which are then applied to the members&#13;
of these strata for all expansions of the sample. These "expansion&#13;
factors" are supposed to account for over and under sampling that might&#13;
occur over the course of the survey. The expanded sample should then be&#13;
correctly representative of the city as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
The 1977 survey is unusual in that as many as 20 percent of&#13;
the working respondents did not report their inocomes: a proportion&#13;
which compares very unfavorably with the census. Because of this high&#13;
proportion a method was devised to impute incomes to the non-respondents.&#13;
Appendix (1) of Mohan (1980) described the calculation of incomes for&#13;
all respondents and imputation method for non-respondents.&#13;
The coverage of income in this survey is not much better than&#13;
that in the census despite the more detailed questions asked. Labor&#13;
income and non-labor income data are taken separately and income in kind&#13;
is estimated as well. Even when the imputed incomes are included the&#13;
survey covers only albout 61 percent of estimated total personal income&#13;
of Bogota. It also appears that the highest incomes are either under-&#13;
reported or undersampled. If the incomes reported in the 1977 sample&#13;
are converted to 197:3 pesos it is found that, on average, there is&#13;
little real growth in incomes, while those in the highest categories&#13;
actually decline.&#13;
The 1978 City Study -- DANE Survey&#13;
The World Bank City Study and DANE jointly conducted a survey&#13;
of about 3000 households in Bogota and 1000 households in Cali. This&#13;
was an expanded as well as more carefully conducted survey than previous&#13;
ones. The survey had 5 main parts: i) Household and dwellings&#13;
characteristics. .ii) Demographic characteristics of all individuals.&#13;
iii) Worker characteristics including information on their place of&#13;
work. iv) Information on the unemployed. v) Information on vehicle&#13;
ownership as well as journey to work characteristics for the workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
A few points are worth noting with regard to this survey.&#13;
A partial recount of dwelling units was done to account for the expansion&#13;
of Bogota since the 1973 census (earlier surveys were all based on a 1972&#13;
sample frame). Information on income was elicited more carefully. In&#13;
earlier surveys, earnings of all workers in a household were usually&#13;
obtained from any adult respondent available in the household. In this&#13;
survey, all worker information was obtained from each worker directly even&#13;
if it required re-visits to the household. Furthermore, income questions&#13;
were asked of all members of the household even if they did not work.&#13;
Two questions were asked to obtain labour income: the wage and&#13;
periodicity of wage payments and also total earnings in the previous month.&#13;
Income in kind was imputed. Various non-labour sources of income were&#13;
specifically mentioned to obtain non-labour income. As a result, the&#13;
income coverage of this survey is about 90 percent (as shown in Table A.a&#13;
below) which is a great improvement over previous surveys.&#13;
The percentage of no information on income was only&#13;
and these have been imputed by the same method as for the 1977 Household&#13;
Survey referred to earlier. All regressions have been conducted after&#13;
weighting each observation with expansion factors similar to the procedure&#13;
for 1973 described above. These expansion factors account for ex-post&#13;
over and under sampling as compared with the sample frame.&#13;
Household Survey Samples and the Spatial Disaggregation of 'Bogota&#13;
Map 1 (in Section III) shows a representation of the map of&#13;
Bogota. The basic socio-economic spatial unit in Bogota is a "barrio"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95-&#13;
or neighborhood of which there were about 500 in 1973 and about 700 now&#13;
as a result of rapid growth of the city. DANE geo-codes this unit&#13;
in a 4 digit number of which the first 2 digits identify a comuna -&#13;
a collection of barrios. The last 2 digits then identify barrios within&#13;
a comuna. These were then further aggregated into "rings" and "sectors."&#13;
The boundaries of the comunas shown in the map are principal streets in&#13;
Bogota. The city is bounded in the East by mountains and therefore&#13;
has an approximately semi-circular shape, although it is longer&#13;
going North to South as is evident from the map. As an aid to under-&#13;
standing the numbering system, note that the first digit goes from 1&#13;
to 9 and roughly rotates (increasing) from South to North by sectors&#13;
(or pie slices). The second digit ranges from 1 to 6 and corresponds&#13;
roughly to rings centered in comunas 31 and 81 and increasing from&#13;
South to North.&#13;
DANE along with the Ministry of Health compiled an inventory&#13;
of blocks ("manzanas") and of dwelling units within the city before&#13;
the census in 1973 and that inventory has continued to form the sample&#13;
frame of all subsequent surveys in Bogota. Thus none of these surveys&#13;
had sampled the new neighborhoods that have developed in the past 5&#13;
years. The sampling is designed to make it equi-probable that any&#13;
dwelling unit in the city according to the 1972 inventory may be selected.&#13;
The basic unit of sampling (unidad primaria de muestra) is a block within&#13;
which all households in all dwelling units are interviewed. Provision&#13;
is made for different sizes of blocks. Since all the sampling was&#13;
based on the 1972 sample frame it was difficult to trace time trends&#13;
in the changes within the city. Moreover, any conclusions that are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-&#13;
drawn about the changing character of neighborhoods must be cautious. If&#13;
different regions of the city differ from one another systematically&#13;
and if one region changes character over time the later samples would no&#13;
longer be representative. Sampling is based on the classification of&#13;
neighborhoods into the 6 socio-economic strata. If neighborhoods&#13;
change character i.e., filter up or down in the socio-economic&#13;
scale, the resulting sample would then no longer be representative.&#13;
Hence, drawing conclusions about fine changes in come distribution from&#13;
two household surveys at two points of time is a hazardous business&#13;
without detailed knowledge of the sampling procedures used. If, however,&#13;
rates of change are not high, such difficulties are minimal: but even&#13;
one would have less interest in tracing time trends anyway! These&#13;
remarks may be extended to the coverage of national surveys where the&#13;
heterogeneity of regions is perhaps typically more pronounced than&#13;
within a city.&#13;
These details have been offered here since they are seldom&#13;
given by users of household.survey data. They became particularly&#13;
important when comparisons are made between surveys of different&#13;
years and information on each data source is necessary in order to be&#13;
aware of biases that may arise from differences in survey design and&#13;
coverage.&#13;

There is considerable skepticism concerning the coverage of&#13;
income in household surveys. Detailed estimates of the coverage of&#13;
Bogota have been made by comparing the total personal income from regional&#13;
accounts, national income accounts and incomes as revealed in surveys. 1/&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
This document is intended as a user's guide to the program&#13;
EQUALISE. The program is intended as an aid for income distribution&#13;
studies that are increasingly being done using large cross sectional&#13;
micro data sets. Its special feature is that it can use as input the&#13;
micro data directly rather than grouped data as has been necessary for&#13;
other existing programs computing various inequality indices.&#13;
The program performs three tasks. It has a subroutine&#13;
CROST which essentially performs cross-tabulations. For example,&#13;
tables can be produced for the distribution of income by any desired&#13;
number of quantilies for different subgroups of the population like&#13;
different regions. Cumulative frequencies are also available. Second,&#13;
subroutine MEADIS computes seven selected measures of income distribution&#13;
from any desired number of observations on the Lorenz curve. Thus the&#13;
micro data can either be used directly to compute these indices or&#13;
first grouped into quantiles by CROST and fed subsequently into MEADIS.&#13;
This is accomplished internally in the program obviating the need for&#13;
tedious punching of data for the computation of income distribution&#13;
statistics. Lastly, subroutines ANANDT and ANANDL decompose the Theil&#13;
inequality index and the log variance of incomes for different sub-&#13;
groups of the population. These indices are computed for each sub-grQup&#13;
desired and measures provided for the inter-group and intra-group&#13;
contribution to total inequality. EQUALISE is flexible so that any or&#13;
all of the above operations can be performed in one single run. MEADIS&#13;
was originally written by Sherman Robinson and ANANDT and ANANDL by Sudhir&#13;
Anand.-/&#13;

The rest: of the document is organized as follows; section 2&#13;
describes the general structural outline of the program; section 3&#13;
describes the input: requirements; section 4 points out the changes&#13;
needed in the main routine for different runs; section 5 lists the&#13;
data and the results of a sample run; and section 6 lists the program&#13;
for the sample run.&#13;
2. Structure of EQUALISE&#13;
The program consists of a MAIN program and four subroutines.&#13;
Only the main program contains parts that need to be changed by the&#13;
user. This point will be elaborated further in section 4. Also, all&#13;
inputs are read in the main program and subroutines are called only&#13;
in the main program. Following is the list of subroutines called by&#13;
the main program.&#13;
Group 1:       CROST with Entry Point MEAN&#13;
Group 2:       MEADIS&#13;
ANANDT&#13;
ANANDL&#13;
The cross-sectional micro data (containing socio-economic&#13;
variables including income) are read in the MAIN program and then fed&#13;
into the subroutine CROST where they are cross-tabulated. When all the&#13;
records are accounted for, the subroutine CROST is entered at the Entry&#13;
MEAN where the mean of each category of column variable (income) is&#13;
calculated. Also, the frequency table of the column variable is printed&#13;
along with the mean of each category.&#13;
Subroutines in Group 2 are the routines that calculate the&#13;
income distribution measures and the decomposition statistics. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
routines use the results from Group 1 as their inputs. Subroutine MEADIS&#13;
produces 7 selected income distribution measures: relative mean deviation,&#13;
variance of income, coefficient of variation, standard deviation of logs,&#13;
the Theil index, the Atkinson measure and the Gine coefficient.&#13;
Subroutines ANANDT and ANANDL produce decomposition statistics&#13;
for the Theil and Log-variance indices respectively.&#13;
The user has an option of producing either the income distribution&#13;
measures frbm MEADIS only or the decomposition statistics from ANANDT&#13;
and ANANDL or both simultaneously.&#13;
3. Input Requirements&#13;
There are two types of input that are needed for this program.&#13;
The first is a card deck or file containing control parameters, input&#13;
file name, variable names and the definition of categories for row and&#13;
column variables. The second input is a data file containing socio-&#13;
economic variables including an income variable. The second input requires&#13;
the correct format statement and data transformations, if necessary, to&#13;
be specified in the MAIN program. The rest of this section will elaborate&#13;
on the first input that has to be prepared by the user.&#13;
The input data for each job to be prepared by the user are&#13;
summarized in the following table, followed by a detailed discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Input Data for Each Job&#13;
Card Type        No. of Cards             Variable           Format&#13;
1                  1              Input file name        10A6&#13;
2                  1              NOUT1, NOUT2, N         3I2&#13;
3                  1              ICOR1, NI, NAME1,&#13;
ICOR2, NJ, NAME2       2(2I3, A6)&#13;
4               NI/5                    Cl               5F8.0&#13;
5               NJ/5                    C2               5F8.0&#13;
Multiple jobs may be done in the same run by simply repeating&#13;
card types 3, 4 and 5 for each additional job. The variable N in card&#13;
type 2 should reflect the number of jobs (or matrices) to be tabulated.&#13;
Explanation of the above variables are as follows:&#13;
1)  Input File Name:   the name of the input file containing socio-economic&#13;
variables. This will be printed as part of the&#13;
output heading.&#13;
2)  NOUT1:             Combination of output desired.&#13;
1 = MEADIS     income distribution measures only.&#13;
2 = Decomposition statistics only.&#13;
3 = 1 and 2 both.&#13;
3)  NOUT2:             output desired.&#13;
0 = frequency table of income classes not printed.&#13;
1 = frequency table printed.&#13;
4)  N:                 number of jobs or matrices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
5)  ICOR1:            position of the row variable in the array named "DATA".&#13;
(i.e. if the row variable is the second variable in the&#13;
array called "DATA", then ICORl - 2). Variables from the&#13;
socio-economic data file are read into the DATA array in&#13;
the MAIN program. (See below).&#13;
6) NI:                number of categories in the row variable.&#13;
7) NAMEl:             name of the row variable.   Must be six characters&#13;
or less.&#13;
8)  ICOR2:            position of the column variable in the DATA array.&#13;
The column variable must always be the income variable.&#13;
9) NJ:                number of categories in the column variable.&#13;
10)  NAME2:            name of the column variable.&#13;
11)  Cl:               maximum value of each category for the row variable.&#13;
The number of values in these cards should equal the&#13;
the number of categories NI. The value zero is&#13;
included in the first category unless specifically&#13;
excluded in the MAIN program.&#13;
All observations exceeding the maximum value of the last&#13;
category are excluded and not tabulated.&#13;
12)  C2:               maximum value of each category for the column variable.&#13;
The number of values in these cards should equal the&#13;
number of categories NJ.&#13;
As noted before, the above input data can be in the form of either&#13;
a card deck or a file. If it is a file, the file number 5 should be&#13;
assigned to it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. Changes Needed :Ln the MAIN Program&#13;
The program is designed in such a way that the users must&#13;
change some parts oif the MAIN program. This is rather unfortunate but&#13;
couldn't be avoided since the input file containing socio-economic&#13;
data is read in the MAIN program.    In other words, since these input&#13;
files will be different depending on the user, each user must supply&#13;
the necessary format statement and any other input file specific&#13;
information.&#13;
Basically, there are only two parts of the program that need to&#13;
be changed. The first part is the cluster of dimension statements&#13;
at the beginning of the main program. These should be dimensioned in the&#13;
following way:&#13;
(1)   Arrays needed iFor initializing data&#13;
FILE(10)&#13;
ICORl (N),  ICOR2 (N), NI(N), NJ(N)&#13;
NAME1 (N), NAME2 (N), Cl (N, Ml), C2 (N, M2)&#13;
(2) Arrays needed for subroutines CROST and MEADIS&#13;
MAT (N, Ml, M2), MCT (N,M2), SUM (N, M2)&#13;
MATS (Ml, M2), MCTS (M2), SUMS (M2), AVGS (M2)&#13;
3)  Arrays needed for subroutines ANANDT and ANANDL&#13;
ANL (M2), ANT (Ml), S (Ml), T (Ml)&#13;
ANY (Ml), YBAR (Ml), P (Ml)&#13;
PP (Ml, M2), SS (Ml, M2)&#13;
4) Arrays needed for reading input file&#13;
DATA (NVAR)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
Where:&#13;
N = number of jobs (matrices)&#13;
Ml = maximum number of categories among all the row variables&#13;
M2 = maximum number of categories among all the column&#13;
(income) variables.&#13;
NVAR = number of variables to be read from the input file&#13;
containing socio-economic data.&#13;
The second set of changes start at the statement labelled&#13;
21, and end with the definition of the expansion factor, EXP. The&#13;
statement 21 is a READ statement for the socio-economic data file.&#13;
The user must supply correct READ and FORMAT statement appropriate&#13;
for his file. These statements should be followed (if necessary) by&#13;
transformations of the data. The last statement of this part defines&#13;
the expansion factor.   If the input data is   sample data as most survey&#13;
data are, then the user must define the expansion factor for each record.&#13;
If the data represent the universe, the expansion factor (EXP) must be&#13;
set to unity.&#13;
These changes in the MAIN program mean that the user must&#13;
recompile the program each time a different file is used as input. This might&#13;
be cumbersome, but the cost involved is rather negligible since the&#13;
processing time is less than 3 seconds in most cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. Sample Run: Input Data and Output&#13;
A Sample job was run using the 1978 Bogota Household Survey&#13;
Data. Each record represents one household. The income variable&#13;
used was HINCAP - the household income per capita. Since the&#13;
calculation of inequality is done over individuals (rather than&#13;
households) the expansion factor associated with the household record&#13;
is multiplied by the household size.&#13;
Two row variables are used in this job. First, the sample&#13;
is divided into comunas (38) and then into radial sectors (8) (see&#13;
Appendix 1 for defEinitions). Thus the program produces the 7 indices&#13;
of inequality for the whole sample from MEADIS; a cross-tabulation&#13;
is provided by CRoST by the 20 income groups specified and overall&#13;
inequality is decomposed by ANANDT and ANANDL first by comunas and&#13;
then by radial sectors. All possible outputs are produced except&#13;
that the repeated printing of the frequency table is suppressed.&#13;
The following page reproduces the input data    fed    -&#13;
except for the household survey file itself, followed by a listing&#13;
of a sample of output that can be produced by EQUALISE. A program&#13;
listing follows the sample output.&#13;

            An anatomy of the distribution of urban
            income : a tale of two cities in Colombia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This approach for analysis of
            distributional and other change in incomes in fast growing
            cities in the developing world is based on data from Bogota
            and Cali. Among the distinguishing features is the
            utilization of primary data from different household
            surveys, of comparable quality spread over six years. The
            paper uses different samples, inequality indices, income
            concepts, and ranking procedures in its analysis. Particular
            attention is paid to the existence of spatial inequality
            among different parts of the two cities by using an index of
            spatial income segregation. This is found to be very high
            when the cities are disaggregated spatially into radical
            sectors rather than into concentric rings. The inequality in
            labor earnings is also calculated and decomposed. The paper
            finds that the industry of activity and the size of the firm
            of the worker contribute little to overall inequality in
            earnings. Instead, education, occupation, and residence
            location of the worker contributed most to inequality in
            earnings. The results suggest that increases in spatial
            inequality in household as well as labor earnings could have
            deleterious effects on income distribution in the future. A
            special computer program EQUALISE which can compute income
            distribution indices is included.
