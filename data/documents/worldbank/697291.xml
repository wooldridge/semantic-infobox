CHAPTER 1. THE WATER &amp; SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A.    Country Context&#13;
1.1    Malawi is a relatively small country with a surface area of 119,140 square kilometers, of which&#13;
Lake Malawi occupies about 20%. The topography varies from the Rift Valley floor at almost sea&#13;
level to high escarpments rising to 3,000 meters above sea level. Related to this are wide ranges in&#13;
climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 15°C in the north to 27°C in the south. The&#13;
average rainfall is about 1100mm per year with variations from 700mm to about 2000mm depending on&#13;
topography. The 1992 population of Malawi was 9.0 million, including about 1.0 million Mozambican&#13;
refugees, with 88% living in the rural areas. The average population growth rate is 3.3% per annum,&#13;
the average population density is about 85 persons per km2.&#13;
1.2    Malawi, one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, has recently completed a peaceful&#13;
political transition from nearly 30 years under a single party system, to a multi-party democracy.&#13;
Subsequent events have, however, continued to demonstrate the vulnerability of its primarily&#13;
agricultural economy. A drought nearly as severe in its effects as the one in 1992 has drastically cut&#13;
the production of food and export commodities, and has caused power outages in urban areas and water&#13;
shortages throughout the country. As a result of these developments, the gross domestic product&#13;
contracted by about 9% in 1994. Excessive government expenditures and borrowing in the first few&#13;
months of the fiscal year and a sharply depreciating exchange rate significantly increased inflationary&#13;
pressures and annual inflation rates at the end of 1994 increased to 34.7% which contributed to further&#13;
difficulties in sustaining essential services. Although the new Government (GOM) has continued its&#13;
commitment to the economic stabilization process and its attack on the country's pervasive poverty&#13;
problem, its credibility will be tested by its response to the drought in terms of the maintenance of food&#13;
supplies, and its ability to show progress in the alleviation of poverty, including the provision of more&#13;
widespread and assured access to safe water supplies.&#13;
B.    Sector Background&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
1.3    The availability of surface water resources in Malawi, apart from Lake Malawi, varies greatly&#13;
between the wet and dry seasons, and from year to year.  The marked seasonality and annual&#13;
variability seriously limit the potential of many streams and rivers as reliable raw water sources unless&#13;
storage is provided. There are no major storage reservoirs, but there are a number of medium and&#13;
small structures, primarily in the estate sector.&#13;
1.4    With an area of 28,800 km2, Lake Malawi is the third largest freshwater lake in Africa. It is&#13;
used for a wide range of purposes including water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, fishing&#13;
and recreation. Its levels fluctuate widely creating problems for a number of these uses. Malawi is&#13;
divided into 17 Water Resources Areas, each of which consists of a river basin and with most of them&#13;
subdivided into Water Resource Units. Most surface waters can be classified as soft to moderately soft&#13;
and with high suspended solids content (and thus with accompanying problems of sediment deposition&#13;
and higher treatment costs, etc.) especially during the wet season. The problem is aggravated by&#13;
inadequate environmental watershed protection resulting in soil erosion and decreasing microbiological&#13;
water quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5    Groundwater resources are widespread throughout the country. Their presence is associated&#13;
with two types of aquifers: the extensive, but relatively low yielding (typically 1 - 21/s) weathered&#13;
Precambrian basement complex which underlies approximately 85% of Malawi, and the higher&#13;
yielding, up to 15 t/s, quaternary alluvial deposits in the lakeshore plains and the Shire Valley. The&#13;
quality of groundwater in the weathered basement complex aquifer is generally acceptable although&#13;
localized groundwater quality problems do occur due to high concentrations of some elements present&#13;
in the basement complex rocks.  In the alluvial aquifer, groundwater is more mineralized.&#13;
Groundwater is presently exploited by 9,700 boreholes and 5,600 shallow wells equipped with&#13;
handpumps.&#13;
1.6    A 1986 National Water Resources Master Plan (NWRMP) estimated a mean annual runoff of&#13;
51 million m3/d. Thus, on average, there appears to be ample water resources available. However,&#13;
their geographical distribution, current status of their development and use, and adverse effects on&#13;
water quality resulting from inappropriate land use, indicate that Malawi's water resources are coming&#13;
under serious pressure in some areas.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
1.7    The main statute dealing with the use and management of water resources is the Water&#13;
Resources Act, 1969. This Act sets guidelines for the allocation of water for various uses and the&#13;
monitoring of its quality. It gives the President authority over all water resources in the country. The&#13;
duty to oversee the application of the legislation rests with the Minister responsible for water (now the&#13;
Minister of Irrigation and Water Development) through the Water Resources Board (WRB) appointed&#13;
by him. The Water Resources Act, 1969, was amended in 1990 through the Water Resources&#13;
(Amendment) Act, 1990. Complementary statutes are the Blantyre Waterworks Act, 1971, and the&#13;
Lilongwe Waterworks Act, 1986, which give legal status to the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards.&#13;
Local Government Acts and public health and environmental legislation touch on sanitation and&#13;
environmental aspects. The legal framework has limitations that result from it having been developed&#13;
in a somewhat piecemeal manner to respond to concerns as they have emerged.&#13;
Sector Institutions&#13;
1.8    Although there is some private sector capability in consulting engineering for the design of&#13;
water infrastructure and for supervising construction, and in small scale construction contracting, the&#13;
main players in the sector are government ministries, departments and statutory bodies.&#13;
Water Services to the two Cities&#13;
1.9    The Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) and the Blantyre Water Board (BWB) are statutory bodies&#13;
responsible for water supply services to the two cities.  They operate commercially, receive no&#13;
recurrent funding from the Government of Malawi (GOM), and within the constraints imposed on&#13;
them, are competently managed. They are empowered to operate their own internal commercial&#13;
financial management, employment (to a large extent) and procurement arrangements and appear to do&#13;
so well, contributing substantially to their effectiveness. Many day-to-day decisions which should be&#13;
the sole prerogative of the Boards are subject to Ministerial approval, and their geographical coverage,&#13;
higher level staffing and tariffs are subject to approval by the Ministry of Statutory Corporations&#13;
(MSC). These constraints have at times placed their continuing effectiveness at risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Water Services to Towns and Rural Areas&#13;
1.10   These services are provided by the Water Department (WD) of the Ministry of Irrigation and&#13;
Water Development (MIWD). The Department's services include: a) Policy preparation, planning and&#13;
monitoring of water supply; b) Control and monitoring of the quality of water supply; c) Provision of&#13;
water supply systems to all of Malawi except the declared water areas of the LWB and BWB.&#13;
consisting of three types of supply:   urban type piped; gravity piped community managed;&#13;
boreholes/shallow wells with handpumps, and protected springs; and d) Technical assistance to&#13;
institutions in planning and design of sewerage and effluent treatment.&#13;
1.11   The WD has a broad range of responsibilities including policy development and advice, water&#13;
resource management and enforcement, central services to the sector, and water supply operations.&#13;
There are conflicts of interest between some of these roles, handicapping their effective performance.&#13;
Lower and middle level staff are much in need of incentives and skills development, and key positions&#13;
remain unfilled for long periods. There is thus a significant need for skills development. Most water&#13;
supply assets for which the WD has operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility are inadequately&#13;
maintained, and many become inoperative after a time. Capital expenditure decisions have been ad hoc&#13;
rather than based on articulated sector priorities, and capital expenditure has been favored over O&amp;M.&#13;
The WD operates a Treasury Fund which permits income from its customers to be retained to help&#13;
finance operations and maintenance, but policy and practice have not resulted in sufficient income to&#13;
cover the full costs of service provision.  Tariff levels are currently set too low, and neither the&#13;
financial management skills in the WD, nor the current financial systems, are adequate to provide the&#13;
information necessary to manage the business. Nevertheless, there are several strengths which can be&#13;
built on: (a) data gathering capability; (b) an adequate revenue collecting capability; (c) levels of&#13;
service which are at least sufficient, where systems are operable, to motivate most customers to pay&#13;
their water bills in good time; and (d) LWB and BWB have well developed skills in most essential areas&#13;
- these boards are good models from which the rest of the sector can learn, and they can provide some&#13;
on-the-job teaching capability.&#13;
Water Resources Management&#13;
1.12   The WRB is responsible for the granting of water abstraction rights, and licenses to discharge&#13;
effluent and wastewater. It monitors abstractions and controls wastewater discharges. Its effectiveness&#13;
in water resources management has been handicapped by lack of non-GOM stakeholder representation,&#13;
lack of appropriate authority, and terms of reference that result in very little effective participation on&#13;
the part of interested Departments. The Water Resources Act. 1969, which is intended to provide the&#13;
legislative backing for water resources management, and which is being reviewed, is weak and&#13;
provides neither the Minister nor the WRB with adequate powers. Thus, although most problems of&#13;
water resource deterioration have multi-sectoral causes and effects, there are no mechanisms or powers&#13;
either to mobilize multisectoral diagnosis of the serious water resource problems that Malawi now&#13;
faces, or to take concerted action to solve them.&#13;
1.13   Environmental management at national level and covering all sectors is the province of the&#13;
Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs (MOREA). National environmental management was&#13;
inactive in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
1.14   Local government bodies are responsible for water-borne sanitation, septic tank emptying and&#13;
sludge disposal, and dissemination of pit latrines. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural&#13;
Development (MLGRD) provides technical advice on sewerage and on-site sanitation to local&#13;
government bodies. The relevant local government bodies in Lilongwe and Blantyre operate the two&#13;
largest water-borne sanitation systems, which, however, serve only 15% of the population of the two&#13;
cities, and are poorly run.&#13;
Relevant Line Ministries and Agencies&#13;
1.15   Other Ministries and Agencies with close interests in water issues include the Irrigation&#13;
Department within the MIWD, the Ministries of Works and Supplies, Health and Population, Natural&#13;
Resources, Agriculture and Livestock Development, and Women and Children Affairs and Community&#13;
Services, the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi (ESCOM) and the Sugar Corporation of&#13;
Malawi (Sucoma).&#13;
Existing Facilities, Levels of Service and Coverage&#13;
1.16   BWB and LWB managed water supplies in the two cities serve about 600,000 people. District&#13;
water supplies consist of 53 schemes including 14 supplying institutions (schools, hospitals, etc.) and 39&#13;
supplying communities. Some of the schemes supplying communities are small town water supplies&#13;
while others are of a rural character. The estimated population served by these 53 schemes is 350,000.&#13;
All 53 schemes are managed by the WD through the District Water Supply Fund (DWSF), a treasury&#13;
fund set up by GOM. DWSF is required, legally, to be operated commercially and be financially self-&#13;
supporting. In practice this requirement has been difficult to meet, although considerable progress in&#13;
the financial performance of DWSF was achieved under the Bank-assisted Infrastructure Project (Cr.&#13;
2069-MAI). However, much more needs to be done to redress the poor condition of the assets,&#13;
increase coverage to those who are inadequately served, and sustain a suitable level of service to those&#13;
with access to the systems. The existing facilities of the cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe, and a number&#13;
of the town water supply systems which use surface water as the raw water source, include various&#13;
combinations of dams, intake structures, transmission mains, treatment comprising flocculation&#13;
sedimentation, filtration and disinfection, storage facilities and distribution networks. Water-borne&#13;
sanitation services, currently provided by local government, are operated poorly and reach only about&#13;
15% of the urban population. Inadequately treated wastewater flows into surface and groundwater are&#13;
creating serious health risks.&#13;
1.17   For the rural areas, the facilities include 9700 boreholes and 5600 shallow wells equipped with&#13;
handpumps serving groundwater to an estimated 3 million plus people and 56 rural piped gravity water&#13;
schemes abstracting water from mostly protected catchments, with no additional treatment, and serving&#13;
approximately 1.45 million people. Thus, only about 60% of the total population have access to water&#13;
supply services (69% urban and 58% rural). The water is supplied through communal water points&#13;
only. Some of the DWSF schemes and rural piped gravity supplies, and a large number of boreholes&#13;
and wells, are not functioning adequately or at all. The estimates given are consequently, of the&#13;
number served if all facilities were fully operational, and many included in these estimates do not&#13;
currently have convenient access to safe water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C.    Sector Issues&#13;
Environmental Issues&#13;
1.18   The quality of some of the nation's more important water resources, and the aquatic and&#13;
riparian environments with which they are associated, are increasingly at risk. This is due to three&#13;
main causes. First, a rapidly increasing population is resulting in increases in the intensity of land use.&#13;
Subsistence farming is encroaching onto more steeply sloping and less suitable land, and deforestation&#13;
is occurring due to the demand for land for agriculture, and for wood, particularly for fuel. As a&#13;
result, the sediment load and turbidity of surface runoff is increasing, accompanied by increased&#13;
transport of microbiological contaminants and greater risk to human health, as well as threats to the&#13;
aquatic iota of some resources. Second, contamination of water resources arising from unplanned&#13;
settlements and associated poor sanitary conditions and improper disposal of wastes is increasing in&#13;
many parts of the country. In urban areas poor maintenance often results in sewer overflows, leading&#13;
to severe pollution of surface water resources. Third, chemical contamination of water resources is&#13;
increasing, due to the improper application of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, the discharge of&#13;
hazardous wastes from hospitals and other institutions and, in perturbing areas in particular, the&#13;
improper disposal of chemical wastes from industries.&#13;
1.19   Environmental problems arising from major structures such as dams is not an issue in Malawi,&#13;
which has no large dams.&#13;
Sector Weaknesses and Constraints&#13;
1.20   The above discussion leads to the conclusion that the water sector in Malawi is characterized by&#13;
a number of weaknesses. From the point of view of results on the ground as seen by the community&#13;
the three main weaknesses are: most of the water supply and water-borne sanitation infrastructure&#13;
manifests a lack of sustainability; service coverage is poor; and the quality of key water resources is&#13;
declining and in some cases already poor. These weaknesses are due in turn to:&#13;
a)     Until recently, the absence of a formal policy framework for the sector, as a result of&#13;
which there has been a failure to determine effectively, and to fulfill in a sustainable&#13;
manner, community needs for water services, and decisions have been made which defeat&#13;
such essential objectives as maintaining rational pricing policies, and allocating available&#13;
financial resources appropriately between O&amp;M and capital development; and&#13;
b)     A set of institutional arrangements which are inadequately matched to the tasks with&#13;
which the institutions are faced, particularly in the institutional arrangements for the&#13;
delivery of all water services (other than water supply services in Lilongwe and Blantyre)&#13;
and for the management of water resources. At central government level, weaknesses in&#13;
the institutional arrangements and policy framework for multi-sectoral environmental&#13;
management have resulted in little being done to address the problems of deteriorating&#13;
water quality.&#13;
D.    Priorities&#13;
1.21   In early 1994, GOM recognized that its priorities in the sector should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)    To prepare an integrated policy framework to provide a new and consistent basis for all&#13;
decision making affecting the sector.&#13;
(b)    To put in place institutional arrangements which would provide for the setting and&#13;
maintenance of policy and policy implementation, and for ensuring community&#13;
participation in determining service standards having regard to the pricing options. These&#13;
arrangements would depend on the incorporation of transparent accountability measures&#13;
for performance both in water services and resources management, and a framework of&#13;
incentives to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the GOM and the community for&#13;
the sector.&#13;
(c)    To develop a set of strategies and actions to implement the new  institutional&#13;
arrangements, and to put the new policy framework into action.&#13;
(d)    To secure funding for investments in rehabilitation and extended coverage which would&#13;
match the improving capacity of sector institutions, and which would be integral to its&#13;
strategy to build and sustain capacity, financial self-sufficiency and self-reliance.&#13;
E.    The Policy Framework and Strategies&#13;
1.22   Recognizing sector weaknesses, GOM prepared a draft document which seeks to meet these&#13;
requirements. In doing so, it involved a wide range of interests in the public sector. The document,&#13;
which was completed in May 1994, contains a statement of policy, an analysis of the status of water&#13;
resources and services, a package of strategies, and a set of proposed actions to implement the&#13;
strategies. It was further considered and amended at a workshop held following the election and&#13;
involving all concerned Ministries and Departments. GOM then approved the document and arranged&#13;
for it to be printed for wide distribution. The approved Water Resources Management Policy and&#13;
Strategies (WRMPS) document, including an Executive Summary (Annex 1.1), is available in the&#13;
Project File. The policies and strategies it provides are briefly described in the following.&#13;
1.23   Policies. The intent of the policy framework is to guide the sustainable management of water&#13;
resources and the provision of services. It consists of a set of seven statements covering:&#13;
a)     aspects of the management and use of water for conservation and environmental&#13;
protection, and the provision of water services; and&#13;
b)    important principles and processes in planning  and  decision-making, including&#13;
stakeholder involvement, the allocation of water, the investment of public funds, and&#13;
pricing and cost recovery.&#13;
1.24   Strategies. The strategies seek to ensure that the policy framework is applied so as to achieve&#13;
the sector objectives. They cover institutional development, capacity building, and the achievement of&#13;
sustainable resource management and investment, as described in the following:&#13;
1.25   Institutional Development and Capacity Building. Other than the existing water supply services&#13;
of the Lilongwe and Blantyre Water Boards, most water supply and water-borne sanitation services are&#13;
being performed poorly, while some are not allocated to any organization and are not being performed&#13;
at all. The proposal is that these services be clearly defined, allocated to appropriate organizations, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the organization reformed, upgraded or otherwise made fully ready to assume responsibility for&#13;
performing the service. The WRMPS document articulates the following reforms and strengthening:&#13;
a)    separation of policy making and monitoring from operational functions;&#13;
b)    restructuring the institutions of the sector to better achieve a) above, and provision of&#13;
legislative and capacity building support for this;&#13;
c)     broadening participation in policy-making by reconstituting the WRB, assigning to it the&#13;
water resources and environmental policy and strategic functions and authority, and&#13;
developing the approach to water resources management to one that involves all affected&#13;
community groups and other stakeholders, and all the necessary expertise from other&#13;
relevant sectors;&#13;
d)     creating three Regional Water Boards (RWBs), to assume responsibility for all urban&#13;
water services except those of the LWB and BWB, and to develop and operate these&#13;
services in a commercial customer-focused manner;&#13;
e)    introducing new legislation, which in addition to establishing the three RWBs, provides&#13;
for them, the LWB and BWB, and the responsible Minister, a set of powers and&#13;
obligations that will best enable all five boards to achieve GOM objectives of commercial,&#13;
effective and sustainable performance, and provides increased decision-making autonomy,&#13;
balanced by increased accountability through the setting of performance targets,&#13;
monitoring and reporting;&#13;
f)    transforming the organization and processes of the WD for planning, implementing and&#13;
operating rural water supplies, from a relatively centralized tradition, to a process that is&#13;
driven by the rural and small town communities themselves, is decentralized and&#13;
responsive, provides scope for the development and management of water resources for&#13;
multiple objectives, and results in better husbandry of limited government resources;&#13;
g)    transferring the responsibility for water-bome sanitation services from MLGRD to the&#13;
respective Water Boards to improve service performance and substantially reduce water&#13;
related pollution; and&#13;
h)     enabling effective planning and the measurement of performance in the range of&#13;
disciplines necessary for a more effective sector, by strengthening the key central services&#13;
of hydrology, hydrogeology, scientific and laboratory services, and planning and design,&#13;
and establishing new capabilities in investment analysis and sector performance.&#13;
Strategies for implementing these institutional restructuring, reform and capacity building initiatives are&#13;
provided in the WRMPS document.&#13;
1.26   Reducing Dependence. GOM is conscious that one factor contributing to lack of sustainability&#13;
of resource management and water services is a continuing dependency on foreign technical assistance&#13;
not just for the more technically advanced or demanding projects, but for all projects, irrespective of&#13;
the technology to be used. GOM will seek to participate in donor supported projects in such a way as&#13;
to reduce this dependency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.27   Achieving Sustainable Resource Management and Investment. The WRMPS document features&#13;
a new more integrated approach to sustainable resource management and investment. Complementary&#13;
strategies are developed for stakeholder involvement, the allocation of water, allocation of investment,&#13;
and pricing and cost recovery. These strategies are knitted together through the adoption by GOM of a&#13;
few key principles: (a) much more attention will be given in decision process to the economic value of&#13;
water, both at the source and in its various uses to complement the long-standing awareness of its social&#13;
value; (b) both water and investment resources would be allocated through mechanisms which&#13;
encourage the achievement of positive net benefits to Malawi, (c) the mechanisms required to increase&#13;
the probability of positive net benefits are to base allocations of both water and investment resources on&#13;
tangible evidence of demand at prices which reflect the cost of service provision and, (d) since the&#13;
users of water and sanitation services are the best judges of their demand for services at various prices,&#13;
stakeholder involvement is a necessary input to investment choices.  These principles will be&#13;
implemented through further amendments to the Water Resources Act, the strengthening and&#13;
reconstitution of the WRB, the establishment of RWBs for urban and town schemes and the&#13;
establishment of a new approach to rural schemes. The RWBs will be established in a way that will&#13;
provide positive incentives to be demand-oriented in their choice of investments and in the operation of&#13;
the schemes. The rural program will provide improved services in response to local proposals after&#13;
negotiation of agreements regarding the type of system demanded by the local area and cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements for the building and operation of the demanded system. The principle to be applied for&#13;
cost-sharing will be to restrict GOM financial support to a level equal to the per capita capital costs of a&#13;
basic minimum service level. All other costs will be borne by the users of the proposed improvement,&#13;
including capital and O&amp;M in excess of GOM support. These mechanisms will help ensure that&#13;
demand drives the choice of levels of service and that the scheme is perceived as sufficiently valuable&#13;
to the users for them to be willing to incur the essential recurrent costs, or the additional capital costs of&#13;
more elaborate supply schemes than the minimum national standard.&#13;
F.    Investment&#13;
1.28   The policy framework and strategies outlined above provide the basis for:&#13;
a)    the management of water resources and protection of the environment;&#13;
b)    the O&amp;M of existing water supply infrastructure so that it is low cost but sustainable; and&#13;
c)    the rehabilitation of run-down supply systems and the planning and implementation of&#13;
new ones, in ways that should ensure efficiency and sustainability.&#13;
1.29  If the sector is to achieve the effectiveness and sustainability that have been so lacking, it will&#13;
be important that all investment in new services and in the rehabilitation of run-down facilities, be&#13;
implemented in a way which does not outpace the establishment of the new institutional arrangements,&#13;
and the development of institutional and human capacity through training and human resources&#13;
development. If investment and capacity building are to be well matched, close year to year control&#13;
should be exercised over the scale of the investment program, and the process for the selection of&#13;
individual projects should be one that ensures that they are commercially oriented, customer-driven,&#13;
and of high net benefit. This can best be achieved through a sectoral approach to the allocation of&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;

G.    Previous Bank Involvement and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.30   There have been four prior International Development Association (IDA) operations in the&#13;
sector, one with the BWB (1977), two with the LWB (1982 and 1987) and one with the WD (1989).&#13;
These operations helped to build up the capacity of the two city water boards with some success in&#13;
terms of reliable service delivery, self-sufficiency and human resource and capacity development,&#13;
leading to indigenization of all senior management positions, and initiated IDA's involvement in rural&#13;
water supply. They also demonstrated the difficulties of achieving broader sustainability without a&#13;
comprehensive approach to the sector. Such an approach would need to include a framework of&#13;
policies to guide all decision-making, and a complementary set of strategies which should include&#13;
reform of the institutional arrangements to provide a more appropriate environment for effective&#13;
managerial, technical and financial performance. Prior experience also indicates that commercial&#13;
orientation of operations and judicious use of technical assistance coupled with intensive human&#13;
resource development and appropriate incentives are significant contributory factors to the relatively&#13;
good success of BWB and LWB. The proposed project would draw on these experiences by providing&#13;
mostly short-term TA implemented over a longer time frame to provide opportunity for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and reduce the continuing dependency on TA. Investments would be sequenced to match&#13;
implementation capacity to the pace of institutional reform and provision made for annual review and&#13;
adjustment as necessary. The project would also seek to improve the legislative relationship between&#13;
the minister as the strategic directing authority and the water boards.&#13;

CHAPTER 2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
2.1    The primary objective of the proposed National Water Development Project (NWDP) project is&#13;
to support the implementation of GOM's WRMPS by reforming and upgrading the management of&#13;
water resources and the provision of water-related services to:&#13;
a)     ensure convenient access to safe water for domestic use, for a progressively larger&#13;
proportion of the community;&#13;
b)     provide water infrastructure capable of underpinning economic development; and&#13;
c)     assure the protection and management of water resources and of aquatic and riparian&#13;
environments.&#13;
2.2   Improved sector susustainability and upgraded physical and financial performance are&#13;
subordinate objectives vital to the attainment of the primary objective and will be achieved, within the&#13;
project, through:&#13;
a)    institutional restructuring;&#13;
b)    the development and utilization of both the public and private sectors;&#13;
c)     active involvement of stakeholders;&#13;
d)    implementation of a policy framework and strategies guiding new investment in the&#13;
sector, water resource allocation, pricing and cost recovery; and&#13;
e)    implementation of a coherent program of investment in rehabilitation and in new services&#13;
consistent with these principles, and managed by the restructured sector institutions.&#13;
B.    Project Outcomes&#13;
2.3    The outcomes of the project will be:&#13;
a) A new WRB, with membership, terms of reference, support and methodology such as to&#13;
enable GOM to address sector-wide policy issues and water resources management and&#13;
related environmental problems more effectively;&#13;
b) Three commercially oriented RWBs serving all urban areas other than Lilongwe and&#13;
Blantyre;&#13;
c) A modern and consistent legislative environment for the resulting five water boards,&#13;
providing a performance-based relationship between GOM and each board;&#13;
d) Achievement by the five water boards of levels of financial performance such that income&#13;
covers full costs, and of physical performance including acceptable levels of coverage, supply&#13;
continuity, and microbiological quality;&#13;
e) Transfer of water-borne sanitation to the water boards;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
f) Planning, implementation and sustained operation of rural water supply facilities through the&#13;
consistent use of community driven processes;&#13;
g) An estimated increase of 1.5 million people in urban, peri-urban and rural communities with&#13;
convenient access to safe water for domestic purposes, on a sustained basis, through a&#13;
combination of institutional and process reform, and investment in new water supply&#13;
infrastructure and rehabilitation of existing works;&#13;
h) Improvements in the quality of streamflow from catchments designated for catchment&#13;
protection programs;&#13;
i) Provision of a basis to assess threats to key water resources, particularly Lake Malawi and the&#13;
Shire River, and to plan appropriate responses from the results of the water resources and&#13;
environmental studies.&#13;
C.    Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.4   IDA's previous assistance has supported important strides in the sector, in particular in&#13;
introducing in the cities of Lilongwe and Blantyre institutional arrangements, policies and human&#13;
resources development that have resulted in the adoption of sustainable commercial and technical&#13;
practices. If this success is to be consolidated and extended to water resources management and water&#13;
service delivery throughout Malawi, a sector-wide policy-based approach is necessary.   The&#13;
involvement of IDA in the implementation of this approach is appropriate because: (i) IDA has had a&#13;
long prior involvement in, knowledge of and experience with the sector in Malawi; (ii) IDA played a&#13;
central role in assisting GOM to develop the framework of policy and strategies, and the action plan for&#13;
implementation; (iii) successful implementation will require that all initiatives in the sector, whether&#13;
investment or sectoral reform in nature, be coordinated and integrated, and IDA is best placed to assist&#13;
GOM in this; (iv) the proposed Malawi Social Action Project (MASAP) will have important links with&#13;
this project, and close coordination of the two is best achieved if IDA is involved in both; and (v) there&#13;
is a high degree of congruence between this project and the primary objectives of the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS).&#13;
D.    Project Strategy&#13;
2.5    To ensure that investment is properly sequenced with institutional restructuring and capacity&#13;
development and that individual investments are chosen to maximize net benefits within this sequence,&#13;
a sectoral approach to the provision of credit and to the selection and scheduling of investments is&#13;
proposed. Under this approach, the program would comprise: (a) a carefully modulated program of&#13;
institutional restructuring and legislative reform within the sector; (b) all public investments in the&#13;
sector over the five-year period of the project, (other than the provision of new boreholes and wells,&#13;
the provision of which would be closely coordinated with the Malawi Social Action Project (MASAP).&#13;
It is expected that the bulk of the funding for boreholes would be provided under the MASAP, with&#13;
some being provided under this project. However, implementation arrangements for the two projects&#13;
will be carefully integrated); (c) the coordination of all donor financing in the sector according to the&#13;
WRMPS framework, including common implementation arrangements; and (d) criteria and procedures&#13;
for determining investments on an annual basis (or for small rural water supply facilities, on a shorter&#13;
cycle) according to a rolling investment program over the five year period, that takes account of&#13;
institutional, financial and physical considerations, and the true needs of the communities served. The&#13;
program will thus be developed in part through involvement of user communities in determining their&#13;
own needs and contributing to the implementation, O&amp;M of the facilities that serve them, and in part&#13;
through the participation of institutions that are more commercially oriented, empowered and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
accountable. The WRMPS would provide a suitable framework of policy and strategies for the&#13;
proposed sectoral approach. The WRMPS has been adopted by GOM. Formal confirmation of this to&#13;
IDA was a condition of Board presentation (para 5.1).&#13;
2.6    Consequently, the program  is designed to develop the sector in an integrated way, in&#13;
accordance with GOM's recently adopted set of policies and strategies, and with flexibility built in to&#13;
pace the level of investments with institutional and financial reforms, so that the capacity to implement&#13;
and sustain them is consistent with the level of investment in any given year. To achieve this, the&#13;
investment program comprises, in the initial two years, relatively modest capital development targets,&#13;
primarily rehabilitation and maintenance oriented, and of high priority. Investments in the ensuing&#13;
three years of the five-year program are indicative, still emphasizing rehabilitation and maintenance,&#13;
but with a greater share of new developments included.&#13;
2.7    The flexibility required to implement the phased approach is reflected in the review procedures.&#13;
A detailed mid-term review of progress with the initial two years would be undertaken no later than&#13;
October 1997. The review will assess physical, institutional and financial progress of the program to&#13;
date, paying particular attention to performance as measured against targets to be agreed at&#13;
negotiations. Based on the assessment, all aspects of the program will be recalibrated to be consistent&#13;
with the targets as revised according to experience gained by the time of the mid-term review.&#13;
Disbursement of IDA funds for the indicative part of the program will be conditioned on achieving key&#13;
benchmark institutional, financial and implementation targets established at the mid-term review. For&#13;
the indicative phase, the program will be maintained on a two year rolling basis, with annual reviews&#13;
confirning or amending investments arising from the commercial, user-driven processes proposed, and&#13;
taking account of progress made against the revised targets, including the results of environmental&#13;
analyses, agreed at the mid-term review.&#13;
2.8    Technical Assistance (TA! Strategy. The TA strategy is aimed at ensuring that skills in the&#13;
service delivery organizations of the sector cover the spectrum of disciplines required, at a sufficient&#13;
level that they can meet challenging performance targets sustainably, and in a self sufficient manner.&#13;
To achieve this all TA assignments will be short term, and TA will be provided at its most intense level&#13;
in the first year, and continue intermittently and at a lower level over the following three years to&#13;
ensure skill consolidation and adequate depth in each organization. To ensure effectiveness, TA will be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with TOR covering each assignment. The TOR will include the detailed&#13;
goals of each assignment and will provide for identification of counterparts, indicators of task and skill&#13;
transfer performance, and reporting and reviewing of achievement in terms of the indicators and the&#13;
objectives both quarterly and at the end of each assignment. The LWB and BWB found that the&#13;
provision of TA through twinning arrangements with foreign water authorities with experience in&#13;
Southern Africa gave excellent results, and this option will be available to the RWBs. TA in most&#13;
skills and tasks for the RWBs will deal with systems and processes (for example, accounting and&#13;
billing) that will be identical for all the RWBs. These will be sourced from one provider to ensure&#13;
consistency and efficiency. TA tasks vary from those suitable for small groups working in teams or&#13;
closely coordinated manner, to specialized tasks without close relationships of expertise or execution&#13;
with other tasks. Tasks performed by teams will be undertaken through contracts with firms able to&#13;
source all the TA required for that task. For those less closely related, GOM will have the option of&#13;
sourcing by stand-alone contract with individuals. The categories of TA and sourcing options are&#13;
shown in Table 2.1. Contracts shown below may be amalgamated, subject to timing, but no contract&#13;
may be divided. Contracts shown as with consulting firms may not be awarded partially or wholly to&#13;
individuals. At negotiations, agreement was reached on TOR for all TA (para 5.4).&#13;

2.9    Environmental Strategy.  The environmental strategy comprises two aspects:  first, water&#13;
resources and catchment management aimed at maintaining and improving water quality, and at&#13;
protection and enhancement of aquatic and associated terrestrial environments; and second, minimizing&#13;
adverse environmental impacts of construction and operation of the physical works which comprise the&#13;
investment program. Water resources and catchment management will be the focus of (i) the water&#13;
resources works component of the project, which aim at controlling erosion in a number of catchments,&#13;
and (ii) the proposed program of studies of water resources and environmental management, which will&#13;
address opportunities for monitoring and management of Lake Malawi and the Shire and Songwe&#13;
Rivers.  Adverse environmental impacts of construction and operation of physical works will be&#13;
minimized in accordance with the strategy for environmental protection incorporated in the GOM's&#13;
WRMPS. This requires that appropriate environmental analyses be conducted for all physical works&#13;
comprising the investment program. The annual reviews and mid-term review will include processes&#13;
for the selection and scheduling of investments and these processes will take into account the results of&#13;
environmental analyses for each investment.&#13;
E.    Summary Project Description&#13;
2.10   For the full five years, the project would include: a) Institutional Reform and Studies (about&#13;
US$13.8 million or 20% of base costs), comprising: (i) institutional restructuring, and capacity building&#13;
(US$3.5 million or 5% of base costs), (ii) consultancy services for project preparation and&#13;
implementation support (US$ 8.4 million or 12% of base costs), and (iii) studies of water resources and&#13;
environmental management (US$1.9 million or 3% of base costs); (b) Physical Works (about US$49.7&#13;
million or 68% of base costs) including rehabilitation of water supply schemes, water resources&#13;
protection and management including catchment revegetation (US$8.0 million or 11% of base costs),&#13;
extensions (US$ 30.8 million or 42% of base costs) and new schemes for water supply and sewerage&#13;
and sludge disposal sites (US$ 10.9 million or 15% of base costs); and (c) Goods and Equipment (about&#13;
US$9.0 million or 12% of base costs) including stores, workshops, spares, mechanical and electrical&#13;
plant for the Lilongwe water treatment plant, laboratories and offices, laboratory, office, field testing&#13;
and telecommunication equipment, meters, meter testing and repair equipment, together with tools,&#13;
vehicles, and GIS required for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.11   The initial two-year investment program, selected on the basis of consistency with sector&#13;
priorities, includes rehabilitation of 5 urban and 2 gravity-fed rural schemes and 2200 boreholes; the&#13;
provision of 300 new boreholes; expansion of 10 urban schemes and augmentation of the transmission&#13;
system for LWB; soil conservation measures for five unprotected catchments; facilities and equipment&#13;
including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for water resources management and planning and TA&#13;
for capacity development and project implementation support and studies. The proposed five-year&#13;
program is described below and detailed in Annex 2. 1.&#13;
F.    Institutional Reform and Studies&#13;
Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building&#13;
2.12   Water Resources Board. Reconstituting the WRB involves administrative directives functions&#13;
and objectives specifying new authority, responsibility and functions, appointment of a high level&#13;
multidisciplinary membership at Permanent Secretary and Head of Agency level, with representation&#13;
from the private sector, and appropriate skills support. It will also involve the enactment of new water&#13;
resources management legislation, replacing or substantially amending the Water Resources Act. The&#13;
legislation will (a) give legal status to the establishment of the new high level WRB, with functions and&#13;
objectives in water resources management, and with a secretariat and budgetary support both provided&#13;
through the WD; (b) provide guidelines for water resources management achieved through the&#13;
involvement of all stakeholders, and bringing to bear all appropriate Ministries and disciplines; (c)&#13;
empower the Minister and the WRB to use economic and financial measures to promote more effective&#13;
water resources management (eg. charging to discourage waste discharge into waters or to encourage&#13;
efficient use of water withdrawn); and (d) empower the Minister and the WRB to take effective action&#13;
in the courts when other approaches have failed. The adoption by GOM of the WRMPS, with its&#13;
emphasis on stakeholder involvement as the methodology to be used for water resources management&#13;
where communities affect or are affected by water resources problems, provides the WRB with both&#13;
the opportunity and the obligation to ensure that this effective and sustainable approach is implemented.&#13;
Implementation of the WRMPS would remove the WD's potential conflict of interest in both&#13;
performing operational functions, and being required to advise GOM on the regulation of its own&#13;
activities. These measures would be aimed at establishing the WRB (i) as a more effective policy&#13;
advisory entity to GOM; (ii) as a body more representative of the key stakeholders concerned with the&#13;
management of water resources and their utilization; and (iii) as appropriately structured and supported&#13;
to deal with water resource protection, allocation, pricing and other key policy issues.&#13;
2.13   The project supports this component through (a) support of studies and TA in restructuring and&#13;
strengthening the WD which will provide the secretariat, and scientific and technical services to the&#13;
WRB; and (b) encouraging timely action through conditionalities regarding the set of actions to be&#13;
taken.  First, completion of the initial administrative actions to reconstitute the WRB, namely,&#13;
specifying new authority, responsibility, and functions for the WRB establishing it as the peak body&#13;
responsible for water resources management and sector policy advice, and appointing to it, new high&#13;
level multi-disciplinary membership, was a condition of Board presentation (para 5.1).  Second,&#13;
completion of the necessary steps for the reform of the water resources management legislation, and&#13;
provision of a secretariat and technical and budgetary support, satisfactory to IDA, for the WRB, was a&#13;
condition of disbursement for the catchment revegetation sub-project (para 5.3).&#13;

2.14   The WD will be restructured and downsized. Its water supply services to country towns and&#13;
institutions known as the District Water Supply Fund Schemes (DWSF schemes) will be split off and&#13;
allocated to three new Regional Water Boards as described in para. 2.20 below. Its water supply&#13;
services to rural areas, which include the provision and rehabilitation of boreholes and wells, and the&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance of gravity piped rural water supply schemes, will be&#13;
decentralized and reformed. The remainder of the WD will be restructured to provide a defined set of&#13;
central support functions, some of which will also be strengthened. The reform of central support&#13;
services and of the provision of rural water supplies will be achieved as described in the following.&#13;
2.15   Water Department Central Services. The principal functions of the WD's central services units&#13;
will be to: (i) perform the review and negotiation process of the rural water supply program, and&#13;
monitor and assess the performance of the program on an on-going basis; (ii) provide technical support&#13;
to the WRB and the three RWBs, including assessment of the quality and quantity of surface and&#13;
groundwater resources; (iii) monitor progress with the implementation of policy; (iv) assist GOM to&#13;
set standards and performance targets; (v) monitor compliance with standards and performance targets&#13;
and (vi) provide project coordination services. The WD would therefore incorporate central service&#13;
units performing the following: (a) rural water supply support; (b) hydrogeology; (c) hydrology; (d)&#13;
scientific services (water laboratory and scientific advice); (e) water resources management and&#13;
secretariat of the WRB; (f) planning and design; (g) investment evaluation and sector performance; and&#13;
(h) project unit (PU).&#13;
2.16   The project supports this component through (a) TA in leading and organizing processes,&#13;
customer-driven service provision, and in institutional reform and restructuring including support for&#13;
the downsizing and restructuring, and for the strengthening of some of the central services of the WD;&#13;
(b) staff training, development in the range of central services including field services in hydrology,&#13;
hydrogeology, and appropriate procedures and methods for sampling and testing water quality; (c) a&#13;
share to be agreed of the funding of initial working capital requirements including materials, plant and&#13;
equipment including appropriate water testing equipment and systems; and (d) conditionalities&#13;
regarding the leadership of the WD. The restructuring of the WD will affect what virtually every staff&#13;
member will do each day, and accordingly will require continued strong leadership within the&#13;
Department. GOM will ensure that the three most senior positions of the WD shall be occupied by&#13;
persons with appropriate qualifications, experience and achievements.&#13;
2.17   Rural Water Supply Program.  Responsibility for services in small areas and villages will&#13;
continue to be based in the WD in the near term, rather than being transferred immediately to the&#13;
RWBs. GOM has adopted, however, two major changes in the way this responsibility will be&#13;
exercised. First, as cities and towns served by the DWSF schemes develop and expand, it is expected&#13;
that the RWBs will expand their service areas to include existing peri-urban and nearby rural areas,&#13;
currently considered part of the rural water program. Second, the WD will restructure all existing&#13;
rural water supply programs into a consolidated rural program (see more detailed discussion in&#13;
Annex 2.2), based on a set of widely promulgated rules, which will be developed with stakeholder&#13;
involvement through a consultative council, and which will emphasize local demand for services. In&#13;
the program, improvement schemes will be undertaken in response to locally initiated proposals and&#13;
only after satisfactory negotiations have established the relative responsibilities of the local area and&#13;
GOM for payment of capital and O&amp;M costs. GOM's share in the costs of improved service will be&#13;
restricted to no more than the costs of a minimum service level provided through a hand pump together&#13;
with a concrete apron, drainage and a wash slab. The proposing local area will provide for O&amp;M costs&#13;
in all cases and any capital costs in excess of this minimum. Completion of rules and guidelines,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

satisfactory to IDA, for the community-led processes of rural water supplies was a condition of Board&#13;
presentation (para. 5.1).&#13;
2.18   These same principles of community driven provision of local infrastructure have been&#13;
incorporated into the proposed Bank-assisted MASAP. Many rural communities that do not have&#13;
convenient access to safe water supplies are likely to place the provision of new safe water supplies&#13;
high on their list of priorities for facilities to be provided under MASAP arrangements. The provision&#13;
of small rural water supplies will therefore be an essential part of the MASAP's menu of options for&#13;
these communities. Accordingly, the proposed MASAP will incorporate a large proportion of the&#13;
program for the provision of new boreholes, together with a range of associated options for small local&#13;
water supplies.&#13;
2.19   The project supports the Rural Water Supply Program through (a) TA in developing and&#13;
organizing community-driven approaches to the provision of water services, (b) funding a prioritized&#13;
program of hydrogeological and hydrological assessment and mapping to provide an information base&#13;
available to communities, and (c) funding of the construction of new rural water supply facilities&#13;
including new boreholes, and gravity-fed schemes, and the rehabilitation of existing boreholes and&#13;
gravity-fed schemes, developed through similar community-driven processes.&#13;
Urban Water and Sewerage Services&#13;
2.20   Regional Water Boards. The RWBs will be set up on a commercial basis to improve the&#13;
demand focus of water supply programs, and to strengthen the sustainability of water services through&#13;
a shift to commercial practices by the RWBs. The assets of the DWSF schemes will be divided between&#13;
the RWBs, the market areas of which will initially consist of the medium sized cities, small towns and&#13;
institutions currently being served by the DWSF schemes. This component comprises: (a) legislation&#13;
that: (i) establishes the RWBs; and (ii) assigns functions, powers and obligations to the RWBs&#13;
(providing at the same time an improved set of these for the LWB and BWB); (b) identification and&#13;
valuation of assets and liabilities, determination of financial structure, and assessment of requirements&#13;
for materials, plant and equipment; (c) preparation of business plans by each of the RWBs; (d)&#13;
preparation of charters, to include performance agreements between GOM and the RWBs; (e)&#13;
preparation and implementation of organization and staffing plans that clarify internal responsibilities&#13;
and include: (i) downsizing and/or rationalization of staffing arrangements; and (ii) detailed training&#13;
programs; (f) design and implementation of improved financial management, including: (i) satisfactory&#13;
financial and accounting systems and procedures; (ii) tariff-setting and cost-recovery practices; (g)&#13;
adopting performance targets; and (h) preparation of indicative five and detailed rolling two-year&#13;
investment programs, including detailed design of annual plans.&#13;
2.21   The project supports this component through (a) the provision of TA in institutional reform and&#13;
restructuring; (b) the funding of studies to determine business and human resource plans and other&#13;
requirements of the RWBs (see Para. 3.8b); (c) the provision of the initial working capital requirements&#13;
of each RWB; and (d) the provision of business and technical information systems (including&#13;
accounting, billing, customer inquiry and a common GIS system for asset management and planning).&#13;
2.22   Lilongwe Water Board. LWB's capacity to expand and operate its water treatment and&#13;
distribution system will be increased. LWB and BWB are to have their corporate relationships with&#13;
GOM changed from the present one in which the legislation provides very close and detailed oversight&#13;
by the Minister and the MSC, to relationships more appropriate to well-performed commercial entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Less detailed oversight needs to be balanced by arrangements for performance target-setting,&#13;
monitoring and reporting, enabling the Minister to exercise the strategic oversight appropriate to his or&#13;
her responsibility as principal shareholder. This component consists of support for (i) the development&#13;
of the proposals for the legislation which will establish the RWBs and put in place a consistent and&#13;
performance based relationship between GOM and each of the five water boards, drawing upon the&#13;
experience of the LWB and the BWB; (ii) for the establishment of business planning and performance&#13;
monitoring and reporting; and (iii) staff training and development.&#13;
2.23   The project supports this component through (a) TA in institutional reform and restructuring,&#13;
and in business planning and implementation support, and (b) staff training and development in&#13;
financial management and technical aspects of water supply infrastructure services.&#13;
2.24   Water-Borne Sanitation Services. This component comprises (a) the administrative measures of&#13;
transferring responsibility for all aspects of water-borne sanitation services from local authorities under&#13;
the responsibility of MLGRD to MIWD; (b) studies to prepare for the transfers including studies of&#13;
assets and liabilities associated with existing services, essential rehabilitation works, including measures&#13;
to reduce to acceptable levels pollution resulting from untreated discharges and overflows, the&#13;
preparation of business plans, human resources plans, and initial requirements for facilities, plant and&#13;
equipment, and the scheduling of transfer events and activities; (c) agreement on performance targets,&#13;
monitoring and reporting; and (d) the transfer events and activities themselves. The timing of the&#13;
transfer will be included in the recommendations of the studies but should not be later than two years&#13;
after credit effectiveness.&#13;
2.25   The project supports this component through (a) TA in institutional reform and restructuring,&#13;
accounting and associated business systems, and in appropriate technology for the treatment of sewage&#13;
and the disposal of treated effluent; (b) staff training and development in environmental, technical and&#13;
business aspects of wastewater services; and (c) a share to be agreed of initial working capital&#13;
requirements for this service including initial requirement for materials, plant and equipment, and&#13;
business and technical information systems.&#13;
Studies&#13;
2.26   There are two important water resource issues in Malawi which warrant substantial study&#13;
programs. First, both surface water and groundwater sources are, and will continue to be, important&#13;
for the provision of piped water supply systems and boreholes providing water for domestic and&#13;
industrial purposes. Both types of source will also be important for the development of irrigation.&#13;
However, both are relatively undeveloped in most areas, and future development will be handicapped&#13;
unless the current sketchy knowledge of the occurrence and likely yield and quality of both surface and&#13;
groundwater resources is substantially increased. Second, the most important and valuable water&#13;
resource in Malawi is clearly Lake Malawi, and its effluent, the Shire River. Yet little is known about&#13;
Lake's basic hydrological and meteorological indicators, and measures of biological productivity,&#13;
which will be important for its future management and protection. Lake levels are lower than they&#13;
have been in the last 65 years and there is a risk that, if the drier than average climatic sequence&#13;
continues, and Lake levels remain unregulated, then flow in the Shire River towards the end of the dry&#13;
season may drop to unprecedented low levels, with potentially disastrous effects. Further, the Lake's&#13;
main tributaries are important to its future health, and need to be managed so that the most serious&#13;
problems of sediment inflow are minimized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.27   The proposed program of studies is designed to address these issues, and will consist of the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)    investigation of alternate sources of water to enhance reliability of supply for some of&#13;
the urban schemes;&#13;
(b)    hydrogeological and hydrological assessment and mapping to provide an information&#13;
base;&#13;
(c)    seawatch for Lake Malawi: - installation of appropriate equipment and systems for the&#13;
automatic collection, transmission and recording of data on water currents, surface&#13;
waves, windspeed and direction, air pressure, relative humidity, algae concentrations&#13;
and other water quality parameters for use in navigation, environmental monitoring,&#13;
fisheries development and maritime research;&#13;
(d)    Lake Malawi level control: - to regulate the water levels of the Lake in order to&#13;
minimize the likelihood of extremely low levels and no-flow conditions in the Shire&#13;
River so as to sustain socio-economic growth through the development and maintenance&#13;
of hydropower generation, navigation on Lake Malawi and water supplies for use in&#13;
municipal, industrial, irrigation and recreational developments;&#13;
(e)    flood forecasting for the Lower Shire Valley:- to improve the forecasting and issuing of&#13;
warnings of impending floods in good time to allow timely evacuation and safeguard&#13;
against loss of life and reduce damage to property; and&#13;
(f)    Songwe River Training:- a prefeasibility study aimed at stabilizing the course of the&#13;
Songwe River to reduce sediment loads and local flooding and develop agriculture and&#13;
fisheries, and generate hydropower.&#13;
2.28   The project supports this component through the provision of credit, to finance the studies, the&#13;
strengthening of the central services of the WD, and the institutional restructuring initiative re-&#13;
establishing and strengthening the WRB as the entity responsible for water resources management and&#13;
the provision of policy advice to GOM in relation to the water sector.&#13;
I.     Investment Components&#13;
2.29   The investment program (set out in detail in Annex 2.1) would consist of:&#13;
(a)    rehabilitation of existing systems. (i) the initial two years: to restore existing schemes to&#13;
their design capacity and performance. This would involve repair and/or replacement of&#13;
intake structures, treatment units, broken or inadequately sized pipes and storage tanks&#13;
and defective meters and other instrumentation and control systems, replacement of&#13;
defunct boreholes including screens and casings and pumps together with the construction&#13;
of aprons, washing slabs and soakaways. This would encompass 5 urban water schemes,&#13;
2 gravity-fed piped rural schemes and 2,200 boreholes (1,100 per year (600 for partial&#13;
and 500 for full rehabilitation)). It would also include works for the protection of&#13;
catchment areas, consisting of soil conservation measures involving restricting&#13;
cultivation on steep river banks and other unsuitable locations, revegetation and farmer&#13;
education to alleviate soil degradation and preserve the quality of water in 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
unprotected catchments used as sources of raw potable water; and (ii) years three to&#13;
five: an indicative program comprising rehabilitation of 3 urban and 3 gravity-fed piped&#13;
rural water schemes, and 3,300 boreholes; protection of 10 catchment areas, and&#13;
stabilizing the watercourse of the Songwe River.&#13;
(b)    new schemes: (i) the initial two years: the construction of 2 gravity-fed piped rural&#13;
schemes (intake structure, transmission mains, slow sand filters) and 300 boreholes;&#13;
and (ii) years three to five: 7 urban and 4 gravity-fed piped rural water schemes, 450&#13;
boreholes, 2 sewerage systems comprising collection systems, lift stations and oxidation&#13;
ponds for the treatment and stabilization of domestic wastewater, and 9 septage and&#13;
sludge disposal sites consisting of shallow basins excavated in the ground with sealed&#13;
bottoms to minimize seepage and soil and groundwater contamination and operated as&#13;
anaerobic ponds for settling and stabilizing sludge.&#13;
(c)    extension:  (i) the initial two years: to increase the existing production and supply&#13;
capacity of the LWB system as well as those of 12 other urban centers. For the 12&#13;
towns, the works would include augmentation of intake systems, treatment facilities&#13;
including sedimentation, filtration, final clarification and sterilization, and upgrading of&#13;
transmission mains and reticulation networks together with pumps and storage tanks to&#13;
meet projected future demands to the year 2005; and for LWB, the provision of&#13;
electrical and mechanical plant for filters and clarifiers, and supply and installation of&#13;
transmission mains; and (ii) years three to five: 17 urban water schemes, and the&#13;
Zomba water supply system including the Zomba dam, - a 47m high rock-fill dam with&#13;
a sealing core zone of selected earthfill and impounding a reservoir with a capacity of&#13;
3.4 million m3 on the Lower Mulunguzi River. The dam will abut the downstream face&#13;
of the existing dam, with the same effect as raising the existing dam, providing the&#13;
storage capacity and yield necessary to supply Zomba and adjacent rural areas. The&#13;
water will be released into the stream in a controlled manner to augment the existing&#13;
reservoir downstream, from which the water will be abstracted, treated and distributed&#13;
through several service reservoirs. Treatment works for the other urban schemes&#13;
comprise intake systems, sedimentation with coagulation, filtration and chlorination;&#13;
transmission and reticulation systems upgrading together with facilities and equipment,&#13;
including meters and recorders, pumps, instrumentation and controls, tools and GIS.&#13;
(d)    Goods and equipment: including stores, workshops, spares, laboratories, laboratory&#13;
and office equipment, telecommunication equipment, water meters, meter testing and&#13;
repair equipment, leakage detection and water quality testing equipment, tools, vehicles&#13;
and GIS for water resources management and planning.&#13;
2.30   The investments for years three to five are indicative only. The annual and mid-term reviews&#13;
will determine: (a) the progress of implementation with regard to agreed performance indicators&#13;
including the institutional, physical and capacity development aspects of the NWDP; and (b) revisions&#13;
as necessary of investment priorities and programs.&#13;
G.    Project Costs&#13;
2.31   The total cost of the proposed five-year program including physical and price contingencies but&#13;
net of duties and taxes (US$5. lmillion) is estimated at US$94.1 million equivalent with a foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
exchange component of US$62.8 million or 67 percent of the total. A summary of the estimated cost&#13;
of the program is presented in Table 2.2 and a detailed cost table in Annex 2.3.&#13;

2.32    The estimated costs of rehabilitating selected urban water schemes are based on physical&#13;
inspection of the systems, replacement for components with an estimated useful life of three years or&#13;
less and refurbishment of the remaining components of the systems. A similar but less extensive&#13;
evaluation has been done for the rural systems. The cost estimates for extension and new civil works,&#13;
equipment and materials are based on preliminary designs of the facilities and local and regional&#13;
construction experience and recent quotations for equipment and vehicles.&#13;
2.33    Base costs are expressed in December 1994 prices.  Physical contingencies are estimated at&#13;
10% of the base costs for all items except engineering and goods (5%). Physical contingencies are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
estimated at US$6.5 million or about 9 percent of base costs. Price contingencies are based on the&#13;
following annual percentage of inflation for local costs 15% for 1995 and 1996; 10% for 1997 and 5%&#13;
from 1998 through 2000, for foreign costs, 2.2% from 1995 through 2000.&#13;
2.34   Price contingencies are estimated at US$15.2 million or about 21% of baseline costs plus&#13;
physical contingencies.&#13;
H.    Project Financing&#13;
2.35   The total program cost of US$94.1 million equivalent would be financed as summarized in&#13;
Table 2.3. The IDA Credit of US$79.2 million would finance 84% of the total cost net of taxes or the&#13;
equivalent of 92% (US$57.5 million) of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project with the&#13;
NDF providing about US$5.3 million equivalent, or about 8% of the foreign exchange cost or 6% of&#13;
the total project cost to finance the hydrological and hydrogeological studies for water resources&#13;
management, development and use. GOM's contribution to project financing would be limited to&#13;
about 10% of the costs (US$9.6 million equivalent) excluding taxes and duties estimated at&#13;
US$5. Imillion equivalent.&#13;

Flow of Funds and On-Lending Terms&#13;
2.36   The IDA Credit of US$79.2 million would be made to GOM at the standard IDA terms with a&#13;
maturity of 40 years including a 10-year grace period. US$59.0 million of the proceeds of the credit&#13;
would be passed on by GOM to the newly established RWBs and LWB in a mixture of loans and equity&#13;
(grant contribution), comprising: NWB, US$7.3 million; CWB, US$7.5 million; SWB, US$34.5&#13;
million; and LWB, US$9.7 million. Of these amounts, 60% will be made available as loans, and 40%&#13;
as grants. The ratio of loans to grants will be reviewed annually, and adjusted to ensure that the debt to&#13;
equity ratios of the RWBs and LWB are not higher than 60:40. The interest on the loans from GOM&#13;
would be at a rate 2% above the prevailing rate of inflation, as measured by the National Composite&#13;
Retail Price Index, and the loan is repayable over 25 years including a 5 year grace period.&#13;
2.37   GOM would bear the foreign exchange risk of the IDA Credit. Funds made available through&#13;
cofinancing would be under the terns and conditions of the donors. The execution of a financing&#13;
agreement between the GOM and each WB, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, is a&#13;
condition of disbursement for each WB (para 5.3).  Assurances were given by GOM  during&#13;
negotiations that it would: (i) allocate and disburse its own share of agreed funds for the project; (ii)&#13;
exempt goods imported under the project from import duties and taxes; (iii) exempt foreign consulting&#13;
contracts from all taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.38   Of the IDA Credit, an advance of US$1.5 million has been extended to GOM from the Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF). The advance covered (a) consulting services for a water services sector&#13;
study to (i) rationalize institutional arrangements and sector responsibilities; (ii) help avoid costly&#13;
investment mistakes by improving integrated development of the sector; and (iii) promote efficient&#13;
nationwide management and use of water; (b) project coordinator (8 months) and program leader (19&#13;
months) positions and support; additional preparatory work required in the period between appraisal&#13;
and credit effectiveness; and (c) goods and services for institutional support.&#13;

CHAPTER 3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Implementation Program&#13;
Project Management&#13;
3.1    The NWDP will be coordinated by the MIWD. The GOM will maintain a Program Leader,&#13;
with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA and operating under TORs which were agreed at&#13;
appraisal and confirmed at negotiations (Para. 5.4), to coordinate the NWDP and directly manage&#13;
substantial parts of it. A Program Leader meeting these requirements has been appointed. He reports&#13;
directly to the Controller of Water Services, who is the head of the WD, and will be supported by the&#13;
PU within the WD. The key senior personnel of the PU will include an Advisor, Business and&#13;
Financial Planning, a Manager, Rural Water Supply Program, and a Project Accountant.  The&#13;
proposed organization and composition of the PU and TOR for each of these three positions reporting&#13;
to the Program Leader were agreed at negotiations (para 5.4). Appointment to the PU of an Advisor&#13;
Business and Financial Planning, with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA is a condition&#13;
of credit effectiveness (para 5.2).  A Manager, Rural Water Supply Program, and a Project&#13;
Accountant, each with experience and qualifications acceptable to IDA, will be appointed to the PU as&#13;
a condition of disbursement to the WD for rural water supply works (para 5.3). The Program Leader&#13;
will be responsible for (i) institutional restructuring, process change and those aspects of capacity&#13;
building associated with the WD; (ii) managing the studies program including the studies on water&#13;
resources and environrnental management; (iii) coordinating the implementation of the physical works&#13;
for WD, LWB and RWBs, and the acquisition of facilities and equipment; and (iv) maintaining project&#13;
accounts. The three RWBs and LWB will manage their own capacity building, the urban physical&#13;
works, acquisition of the facilities and equipment designated for them, and the studies of urban water&#13;
sources.  The WD, through existing line units, will manage the rural physical works, and the&#13;
acquisition of facilities and equipment designated for its use.&#13;
3.2    Owing to the sectoral nature of the project, the dominant tasks of the PU will change as the&#13;
project progresses. The initial phase of 18 months will be the most intensive and will be particularly&#13;
concerned with institutional restructuring, process reform, and capacity building. The emphasis in the&#13;
second phase, which will extend over 12 months, will shift to continuing capacity building, increasing&#13;
the pace of investment, and preparing for and servicing the mid-term review. For the remainder of the&#13;
term of the project the main issues will be management of investment, and ensuring continuing&#13;
improvements in the performance of sector institutions. PU staffing will change in skills mix and&#13;
reduce in numbers as the project requirements change. As indicated in para. 2.15 above, there is a&#13;
long term requirement for a PU as a line function of the WD. However, after the first two of the&#13;
above phases it will be staffed at a lower level and with some different skills. Staff allocated to the PU&#13;
(including the Program Leader) who will be required only for the first one or two phases, are and will&#13;
be engaged either on fixed term contracts, or on secondment with fixed termination dates.  All&#13;
termination dates will align with the timing of the phases of the project, and will be extendable only&#13;
with a no objection from IDA.&#13;
3.3    The Advisor, Business and Financial Planning, who will have a background in the development&#13;
of commercially oriented utility organizations will assist the Program Leader for a period not exceeding&#13;
12 months. For the program of institutional restructuring and capacity building, paras. 2.12 to 2.25&#13;
above, the Program Leader will be supported by short term consultants and others under contractual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
arrangements providing TA, and staff seconded from time to time for specific tasks. The Rural Water&#13;
Supply Program, paras. 2.17 to 2.19 above, will be run by a Manager, Rural Water Supply Program,&#13;
who will report to the Program Leader, and who will bring to the project skills in the development of&#13;
community driven approaches to the provision of services. The investment components, para 2.29&#13;
above, will be managed by the RWBs, the LWB, and the WD as line functions. The performance&#13;
monitoring unit of the WD, to be established as a line unit within the WD as part of the restructuring of&#13;
WD central services (para. 2.15), will provide to the Program Leader management information on the&#13;
performance of investments and processes implemented under the project. GOM will establish and&#13;
maintain a performance monitoring unit within the Water Department, will ensure that it obtains,&#13;
maintains, and provides timely information measuring both the investment performance and the&#13;
business and service performance of each of the institutions and agencies of the sector. The PU would&#13;
be provided with the necessary support staff, office equipment and vehicles, and would operate with&#13;
annual recurrent funding contributed by GOM, together with funding for senior staff, TA and certain&#13;
equipment and services made available through the proposed credit&#13;
Sector Policy and Strategies&#13;
3.4    Water Resources Management Policies and Strategies. The WRMPS document sets the policy&#13;
and strategic framework for this project. Accordingly, it has been approved in full by GOM. Formal&#13;
confirmation of the approval of the WRMPS by GOM in a letter of sector policy satisfactory to IDA&#13;
was a condition of Board presentation (para 5.1).&#13;
Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building&#13;
3.5    Water Resources Board. GOM is close to completing the reconstitution of the WRB as the&#13;
peak body responsible for managing the water resources of Malawi, and for providing policy advice to&#13;
the Minister, MIWD, on water resources management and all aspects of management of the sector.&#13;
The conditionalities given in para 2.13 above support the satisfactory and timely completion of this&#13;
process.&#13;
Water Department&#13;
3.6    Water Department Central Services. A study will be undertaken of the resources required by&#13;
the WD to provide central services (Para 2.15) to the sector. At negotiations, TOR were agreed for a&#13;
study of the scope, level and timing of the strengthening and restructuring required for these services to&#13;
fulfill the needs of the restructured water sector, and to determine sources of funding (para. 5.4). A&#13;
study of the strengthening, restructuring and funding of the WD will be under way as a condition of&#13;
disbursement (para. 5.3). The strengthening, restructuring and revised funding arrangements of the&#13;
WD will be completed before the mid-term review.&#13;
3.7    Rural Water Supply Program. The procedures and processes used within the WD to initiate&#13;
and implement the provision of rural water infrastructure will be changed to ensure that communities&#13;
exercise choice and gain as much as possible a sense of ownership of what is provided. This change&#13;
process will be initiated and managed by a Manager, Rural Water Supply Program responsible to the&#13;
Program Leader. This will commence with the development of capacity to support the provision of&#13;
small scale community water supply facilities, primarily new boreholes, using identical community&#13;
driven processes whether the particular facilities are constructed with funding support from the&#13;
proposed IDA-supported Malawi Social Action Project (MASAP), the NWDP or any other donor. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
processes proposed to apply to small-scale water supplies are summarized in Annex 2.2. The steps and&#13;
processes to be implemented include the calling and letting of "rates" type tenders so that wells are&#13;
primarily constructed by contractors, thus seeking to avoid the higher costs typical of construction by&#13;
departmental crews, and of contract construction of wells one by one. They also include processes for&#13;
the community preparation of proposals, and the steps for appraisal, decision making and&#13;
implementation. Implementation steps include quality control, and the requirement that implementation&#13;
is not complete until community representatives have been trained in maintenance and provided with&#13;
tools and spare parts. GOM will arrange for the further development of these procedures to ensure that&#13;
rural communities can acquire water supplies of the categories included in the Rural Water Supply&#13;
Program (paras 2.17 to 2.19), in a way that is community driven. These procedures and rules will be&#13;
compatible with the processes of the MASAP, and will be developed in consultation with&#13;
representatives of rural communities. At negotiations, agreement was reached on procedures to assist&#13;
rural communities to acquire water supplies of the categories included in the Rural Water Supply&#13;
Program, in a way that is community driven and consistent with the rules for the entitlement and&#13;
participation of rural communities (para. 5.4).&#13;
Urban Water and Sewerage Services&#13;
3.8    The Regional Water Boards. The activities required to establish the three RWBs, to bring them&#13;
into action in a way that will enhance effective operation and sustainability, and to provide a modern&#13;
legislative environment for all five water boards, consist of six categories: (i) gearing up, (ii)&#13;
legislation, (iii) business planning, (iv) leadership and staffing, (v) consultation and education, and (vi)&#13;
support consisting of technical assistance, and operational expenses relating to the rental of office,&#13;
laboratory and workshop space, and the maintenance of vehicles and equipment, as the RWBs become&#13;
operational. The critical path management chart "National Urban Water Supply Program", Annex 3.1,&#13;
shows these categories, their constituent activities, and their linkages and dependencies. Those of the&#13;
categories which will require close project management and support are described below.&#13;
(a)    Legislation The powers and obligations of the three RWBs and the LWB and BWB, and&#13;
their relationship with GOM, will be defined in accordance with the principles stated in&#13;
the approved WRMPS document. GOM will incorporate in the draft legislation to&#13;
establish the three RWBs, provisions regarding the powers and obligations of the five&#13;
WBs that are consistent with the WRMPS (para. 5.4). Completion of all necessary steps&#13;
to enable the legal establishment of the RWBs, providing powers and obligations for the&#13;
five WBs consistent with WRMPS and acceptable to IDA, is a condition of effectiveness&#13;
(para. 5.2). The proposals for these reforms will be based on the Minister, MIWD,&#13;
being the strategic directing authority for all five boards. The present role of the MSC,&#13;
which can exercise powers to make decisions on such matters as tariff levels, or can&#13;
prevent such decisions from being made in a timely way, can be an impediment to the&#13;
proper exercise by the Minister of his strategic role, and to the ability of a board to&#13;
achieve the performance targets set by the Minister. It is also inconsistent with the&#13;
WRMPS document, which provides, among other things, that the water boards will&#13;
have "an accountability link to the community served, with a substantial degree of&#13;
independence to set prices", and will be required to meet performance targets.&#13;
(b)    Business Plannin, Business Planning studies will be undertaken to provide for the three&#13;
new RWBs: (i) updating of the previous work on valuation of assets and liabilities; (ii)&#13;
proposed financial structure; (iii) human resources management plans; (iv)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
identification of needs for facilities, plant and equipment (also updating previous work);&#13;
(v) proposed business plans including working capital requirements, initial subventions,&#13;
and pricing scenarios; and (vi) the proposed charter for each RWB. Key products of&#13;
the business planning process are financial and physical performance targets. These&#13;
are required to support Parliament in its consideration of the Bill, and to assist GOM in&#13;
its strategic decision-making on what targets it will want the water boards to achieve&#13;
and the tariff and borrowing outlook necessary to enable the targets to be achieved. At&#13;
negotiations, GOM provided assurances that the performance agreements to be entered&#13;
into with the RWBs will include physical and financial performance targets, relating to&#13;
agreed performance indicators, aimed at ensuring sustainability of water infrastructure&#13;
services including new pricing and cost recovery policies (para 5.4). Also agreed at&#13;
negotiations, were TOR for the Business Planning studies, and the engagement of&#13;
consultants to conduct them (para 5.4). As a condition of effectiveness GOM will have&#13;
recruited consultants to undertake business planning studies for the five WBs (para&#13;
5.2). Completion and adoption of business plans, satisfactory to IDA, for each WB,&#13;
including physical and financial performance agreements, share of DWSF funds, and&#13;
additional initial working capital requirements, is a condition of disbursement to each&#13;
WB (para 5.3). It is proposed that the charters of the five Water Boards each contain:&#13;
(a) the mission and role of the board, (b) a succinct presentation of the key information&#13;
from the business plan with a three to five year focus, including the business strategy,&#13;
the communities to be served and the services to be provided, notable new initiatives to&#13;
be taken, and the financial outlook which will include the outlook for borrowing,&#13;
investment, profit or loss, pricing and subventions, and (c) the proposed (and after&#13;
approval, the agreed) performance agreement between GOM and each RWB, including&#13;
both financial and physical measures of performance. TA will be engaged to provide&#13;
guidance in the business planning process on the following specialist tasks:&#13;
(i)    Preliminary business plan: financial planning specialist;&#13;
(ii)    Business plan, preparatory phase: technical specialists in water utility assets,&#13;
recurrent activities and recurrent financing, investment planning, human&#13;
resources planning, and business strategy development; and&#13;
(iii)    Business plan and charter development: specialists in commercially oriented&#13;
strategic business planning for the sector, and financial planning.&#13;
A total of one person year of expert TA will be available to assist in these activities.&#13;
(c)    Leadership and Staffing. The Chairmen and Chief Executives of the water boards are&#13;
important to the success of the business planning process, as their participation with the&#13;
authority to decide on business directions will ensure that decisions are made in the best&#13;
interests of their future customers and the achievement of the performance targets to be&#13;
set by the Minister. Participation in the business planning process is also important to&#13;
the preparation of the Chairmen and Chief Executives for their future responsibilities.&#13;
Selection and nomination of Chairmen and Chief Executives, with experience and&#13;
qualifications and according to TOR acceptable to IDA, for the three RWBs is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.2). The appointment of a Financial Controller, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
experience and qualifications and according to TOR acceptable to IDA, is a condition&#13;
of disbursement to each RWB (para. 5.3)&#13;
(d)    Bringing the Boards into Operation. As a condition of disbursement to each RWB,&#13;
GOM will vest it with the physical assets, and transfer to it the funds and staff,&#13;
necessary and desirable for the effective operation of all aspects of the business of the&#13;
RWB within its area of operation (para 5.3). This condition does not imply that GOM&#13;
may not apply IDA credit to the preparatory activities for each WB described above.&#13;
The estimated funding for defined operational expenses of each RWB in the first three&#13;
years of operation are given in paragraph 4.9 Both prior to and following vesting day,&#13;
TA will be provided to:&#13;
(i)    guide the design/selection of the key systems and procedures required for the&#13;
effective and efficient operation of the new RWBs and their installation,&#13;
including systems for billing, accounting and stock control;&#13;
(ii)    manage the up-loading of data and testing prior to the commencement of&#13;
operations;&#13;
(iii)    oversee the training of personnel in the operation of the installed systems; and&#13;
(iv)    advise on the on-going improvement, adaptation and amendment of systems&#13;
and procedures that will be required during the first few months after the&#13;
commencement of operations.&#13;
A total of 6 person years of TA will be made available for this support.&#13;
3.9    Water-Borne Sanitation Services.  The transfer of responsibility for water-borne sanitation&#13;
services from local government to LWB and BWB and the three RWBs will require studies of assets&#13;
and liabilities, a brief business planning exercise, and a human resources management plan. Planning&#13;
for the transition, including these studies, will be undertaken by a small team of officers of the WBs&#13;
and of Local Government. TOR for the studies, satisfactory to IDA, will be developed by, and the&#13;
study team will report to, the PU. During the mid-term review, a satisfactory action plan will be&#13;
provided, based on the recommendations of the team, for transferring water-borne sanitation services to&#13;
the WBs.&#13;
Investnents&#13;
3.10   Urban and Rural. The investment components will be managed by the RWBs, the LWB and&#13;
the WD as line functions. This project finances part of the LWB's Third Lilongwe Water Supply&#13;
Project, the largest part being the purchase of pipes and other supplies and materials. The timing of the&#13;
manufacturing and delivery of these supplies should be linked with the timing of construction activities.&#13;
It is therefore a condition of disbursement of IDA credit funds to the LWB, that a loan from the&#13;
European Investment Bank or other donor for the parts of the Third Lilongwe Water Supply Project not&#13;
assisted under the NWDP, be declared effective (para 5.3).&#13;
3.11   Environmental and Water Resources Management.  This project includes a number of&#13;
investments in the management and enhancement of water resources and aquatic and riparian&#13;
environments. Two of these, the Protection of Catchment Areas and the Songwe River Training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Project (feasibility studies) are particularly relevant to the responsibilities of the WRB. In regard to the&#13;
former, both the WRMPS document and the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) refer to the&#13;
problems of degradation of water quality and soil erosion caused by the increasing use of steep slopes&#13;
and the banks of streams for agricultural purposes in catchment areas. NEAP contains a proposal to&#13;
shift agriculture from this land to other unused land, and to rehabilitate degraded land, particularly by&#13;
revegetation, using where applicable, productive tree species. The proposed NWDP thus includes&#13;
investment in rehabilitating and revegetating such degraded areas in catchments. GOM has agreed that&#13;
this will be undertaken without the compulsory resettlement of farmers, and that the processes and&#13;
practices will be planned, developed and implemented with the full involvement of the stakeholders,&#13;
including the farmers themselves. Any resettlement, or relocation of agricultural activity will be based&#13;
on plans and procedures satisfactory to the farmers affected, and to IDA. At negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached on the procedures to be used to achieve effective stakeholder involvement and sustainable&#13;
land restoration, and resettlement principles including compensation (para 5.4). Both initiatives will be&#13;
undertaken under the broad direction of the WRB, reconstituted as specified in the WRMPS. Planning&#13;
and supervision of these investments will be undertaken by specialists of the WD, other participating&#13;
Departments and Ministries, and consultants.&#13;
3.12   Environmental Impact of other Physical Work. The program of rehabilitation and construction&#13;
of boreholes will increase the withdrawal of groundwater and the proposed hydrogeological studies will&#13;
assess the effects of this program  on water tables and groundwater quality.  The location and&#13;
scheduling of future borehole construction will take into account the results of the environmental&#13;
analyses. The WRMPS states that "like water projects, sanitation projects should be preceded by&#13;
adequate environmental impact assessments in order to avoid damaging the quality of water resources&#13;
and air". Accordingly, the selection, design and construction of sludge disposal sites and wastewater&#13;
treatment and disposal systems will be undertaken on this basis. An environmental report for the&#13;
proposed Zomba Dam (to expand water supply to Zomba and its environs) has been completed,&#13;
reviewed and accepted by the Bank. In order to meet the major environmental concern raised during&#13;
the review, the proposed dam site has been relocated to the site of the existing dam. This has resulted&#13;
in a much higher and bigger structure which is considerably more expensive than a dam at the initial&#13;
site on the Upper Mulunguzi. However, no resettlement would be required at this site and a valuable&#13;
wetland would be preserved. GOM is in the process of constituting a panel of experts in the fields of&#13;
hydrology, geotechnical investigations, dam engineering and environment to ensure that the proposed&#13;
dam continues to meet the Bank's guidelines on environmental impact and safety aspects of dams.&#13;
Criteria and procedures for assessing the environrnental aspects of prospective investments and for&#13;
mitigating possible adverse impacts were agreed at negotiations (para 5.4).&#13;
3.13   Monitoring. Reporting. and Review.  At negotiations agreement was reached on:&#13;
(i) criteria and procedures for annual reviews of progress with implementation, and of the proposed&#13;
rolling two-year investment program, and agreement that the annual reviews will take place no later&#13;
than October each year; and (ii) based on the schedule of performance targets and criteria for annual&#13;
investment reviews, procedures for undertaking the mid-term review which shall be not later than&#13;
October 31, 1997, and for resetting targets and investment  programs (para. 5.4).  Reporting&#13;
procedures will include reporting on, progress on, and results of, environmental impact assessments,&#13;
and on progress in implementing measures to mitigate adverse environmental effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
B.       Systematic Client Consultation&#13;
3.14     The  objectives,  policy   framework,  strategies,  and   detailed   proposals  for  investmnent,&#13;
institutional, legislative and process reform, and training and human resources development, were&#13;
prepared by the then Ministry of Works, Supplies and Water Development, under the oversight of a&#13;
Project Steering Committee (PSC) representing all concerned Ministries and Authorities. The PSC was&#13;
consulted at each stage of development of the project proposals, and it and its members made&#13;
significant contributions. With the advent in October 1994 of a new MIWD, the PSC will be&#13;
maintained but under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary, MIWD, to continue the role of on-&#13;
going inter-sectoral coordination, and of consultation between GOM and IDA and other participating&#13;
donors. The monitoring, reporting and review arrangements referred to in 3.13 above will include the&#13;
systematic performance monitoring to be undertaken by the Performance Monitoring Unit which will&#13;
be established as a part of the restructured WD. Information produced by this unit will be important to&#13;
the relevance and success of these consultations. The arrangements for stakeholder involvement, to be&#13;
implemented in fulfillment of the policies laid down in the WRMPS document, including the&#13;
community driven arrangements for the planning and delivery of rural water supplies, will constitute&#13;
systematic  client consultation  on  GOM's  part.   This  will result in  enhanced  dialogue  with  the&#13;
communities served, and will also contribute to useful dialogue between GOM and the donors.&#13;

C.    Technical Assistance&#13;
3.15   Role of Technical Assistance. TA will be required on institutional restructuring, commercial&#13;
financial management and accounting, operations and maintenance, and central services. The proposal&#13;
includes the provision of funding for up to thirteen person-years of TA, and for the Program Leader for&#13;
30 months, and the Project Accountant for the duration of the project as set out in Table 3.1 above.&#13;
The provision of TA is consistent with the TA strategy (para. 2.8).&#13;
3.16   The responsibilities of project staff in each implementing agency and of the TA staff providing&#13;
support for project implementation will be specified in a project implementation manual. GOM gave&#13;
assurances at negotiations that the project will be carried out in accordance with the implementation&#13;
manual and an outline of the manual was agreed (para. 5.4). Completion of a project implementation&#13;
manual satisfactory to IDA, is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 5.2).&#13;
D.    Status of Preparation&#13;
3.17   A water sector services (WSS) study financed by IDA through a PPF (P-763-0-MAI) and&#13;
valuation of the assets of the DWSF financed under the on-going Infrastructure Project (Cr. 2069-MAI)&#13;
have been completed. The WSS study aimed at rationalizing institutional arrangements and sector&#13;
responsibilities and strengthening the regulatory and executive framework for efficient nationwide&#13;
management and use of water resources and prepared the ground for the WRMPS document which has&#13;
been endorsed by Cabinet and promulgated. The asset valuation study determined the gross and net&#13;
replacement value for all DWSF assets; also an inventory and status report of boreholes has been&#13;
prepared. These preparatory efforts have provided the basis for, and guided the selection of, the&#13;
priority elements of the proposed program. GOM has received a second PPF to (i) provide the PU&#13;
with TA support and equipment required for institutional development and capacity building, which are&#13;
so critical to implementation and (ii) engage consultants to finalize further preparatory work on the&#13;
investments component of the proposed project. Detailed design of the Zomba water supply system&#13;
including the dam is in progress as is the work on augmentation of the treatment facilities and&#13;
upgrading of the transmission and reticulation system in Lilongwe.&#13;
E.    Procurement&#13;
3.18   Procurement Experience of Implementing Agencies. The WD and the LWB have executed&#13;
IDA-assisted projects and have some familiarity and understanding of the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines and procedures. Procurement experience within the RWBs would, most likely, be very&#13;
limited. It was agreed during project preparation that this deficiency would be addressed through a&#13;
program of intensive training to be initiated as soon as the RWBs are operational and that the&#13;
procurement capabilities within LWB and the WD would, as much as possible, be made available to the&#13;
PU and the Program Leader especially during the early implementation period to ensure effective&#13;
planning, management and execution of the project. Experience with Procurement involving the WD&#13;
and LWB has in general been satisfactory.&#13;

3.20    During  negotiations assurances were  obtained  that procurement under the  project will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the arrangements summarized in Table 3.2 above.  It was agreed during&#13;
project preparation, that the Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for all procurement for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
civil works and goods whether subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) or nationally&#13;
advertised competitive bidding (NCB). NCB procedures for civil works were reviewed during project&#13;
preparation and found acceptable to IDA. Items (works, goods, consultancies) financed by other&#13;
cofinanciers will be procured in accordance with their procurement procedures and processes.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
3.21   Extension of existing urban water supply systems, including large individual or smaller DWSF&#13;
schemes that can be packaged together (US$38.9 million), and construction of new sewerage systems&#13;
(US$2.6 million), and new (US$3.1 million) and rehabilitated (US$1.9 million) gravity fed rural&#13;
schemes, would be executed under competitive bidding advertised internationally (ICB). Contracts for&#13;
borehole rehabilitation (US$4.7 million), and new boreholes (US$5.8 million), would to the extent&#13;
practicable be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost US$500,000 equivalent or more each, and&#13;
executed under unit price contracts awarded through ICB. Contracts costing up to US$500,000 each&#13;
for extension, rehabilitation of existing and construction of new urban water systems (US$5.7 million),&#13;
representing a number of small contract packages with an average value below US$0.15 million that&#13;
cannot be packaged together, including boreholes in isolated groups, may be awarded through national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB), as would contracts for the protection of catchments (US$0.5 million),&#13;
septage and sludge disposal sites (US$0.3 million), and gravity-fed rural schemes (US$1.3 million).&#13;
Goods and Equipment&#13;
3.22   Goods and equipment, including pipes, fittings and ancillary items, and electrical and&#13;
mechanical plant, US$7.4 million, would be procured through ICB. Vehicles, laboratory equipment,&#13;
computers, spare parts and tools for maintenance would be bulked up to over US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
and procured by ICB. Laboratory and office buildings construction and refurbishment and equipment&#13;
costing US$100,000 equivalent or less per contract (US$0.4 million) would be procured under NCB.&#13;
Items costing the equivalent of US$30,000 or less (US$0.2 million) would be procured through national&#13;
shopping by seeking at least three quotations from eligible suppliers.&#13;
Consultants&#13;
3.23   Technical assistance and training encompassing institutional development and capacity building&#13;
and consultancies for studies, project preparation and implementation support (US$16.4 million), would&#13;
be carried out by consulting firms or individual consultants and/or experts, employed under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. For consultancies financed by IDA, the selection will be in accordance&#13;
with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency", August 1981.&#13;
Prior IDA Review&#13;
3.24   Threshold and prior review procedures for IDA financed contracts would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Contracts for works estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more, and&#13;
contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more, representing&#13;
most IDA-financed goods and civil works would be subject to IDA's prior review in&#13;
accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Selective post review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would be carried&#13;
out during IDA supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(b)     Contracts for consulting services exceeding US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms&#13;
and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals would be subject to IDA's prior review, as&#13;
would (i) contracts awarded on sole source basis; (ii) all TOR regardless of the value&#13;
of the contract; (iii) assignments of a critical nature; and (iv) amendments to contracts&#13;
with consulting firms or individuals resulting in a total contract value equal to or&#13;
greater than US$100,000 or US$50,000, respectively.&#13;
Procurement information will be collected and recorded in quarterly progress reports.&#13;
F.      Disbursement&#13;
3.25   The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed in accordance with the allocation by&#13;
category shown in Table 3.3 over a period of about 7 years although implementation is expected to be&#13;
completed in five years. The longer disbursement period is in line with Bank experience with&#13;
comparable projects previously implemented in the sector in Africa and takes into account the PPF&#13;
advance which will be disbursed at effectiveness.&#13;
3.26   All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented, except for (a)&#13;
expenditures of contracts with a value of US$200,000 or less for civil works, and (b) US$100,000 or&#13;
less for goods, consulting firms, training and field allowances, and (c) for contracts with a value of&#13;
US$50,00 or less for individual consultants which reimbursement may be made against certified&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOE). Supporting documentation for these expenditures would be retained&#13;
by the implementing agencies and made available for review as requested by IDA supervision missions&#13;
and annual audits.&#13;

3.27   To expedite disbursements, five special accounts, one for each of the WBs and  for the WD&#13;
with a deposit initially of US$0.25 million, rising later to US$0.5 million (an amount roughly&#13;
equivalent to four month's estimated expenditures in terms of US dollars ) will be established and&#13;
maintained by each agency in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The special account will be&#13;
replenished by IDA in accordance with agreed procedures. A detailed disbursement schedule is&#13;
provided in Annex 3.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
G.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.28   The three RWBs, LWB and the WD would each prepare annual financial statements and report&#13;
monthly on progress on receipts, financial commitments and expenditure on each investment&#13;
component to the Accountant of the PU in accordance with uniform guidelines agreed between the&#13;
Boards and the Accountant. While it is not required for the audit of the IDA credit, the annual&#13;
financial statements will be audited and the audit reports, together with the auditors' opinions on project&#13;
accounts, special accounts and statement of expenditures (SOEs) will be submitted to the PU. They&#13;
will be submitted to IDA as part of the periodic progress reporting undertaken by the PU. SOEs will&#13;
be reviewed periodically and during supervision missions.&#13;
3.29   A consolidated project account will be prepared by the PU for the overall project and separate&#13;
project accounts by each of the executing agencies, the three RWBs, LWB and the WD, for their&#13;
respective project components. In previous Bank Group projects involving GOM Ministries, accounts&#13;
have been audited by the Auditor General. Accounts for parastatals like BWB and LWB, on the other&#13;
hand, have been audited by private sector external auditors.  These arrangements have proven&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The project accounts will be audited by the Auditor General or by private sector&#13;
external auditors satisfactory to IDA. Under the on-going Infrastructure project, a measure of success&#13;
has been achieved with compliance with the accounting and auditing covenants for the DWSF.&#13;
3.30   The project accounts would identify all sources and uses of funds utilized to carry out project&#13;
activities, including a detailed account of the use of the proceeds of the IDA credit. Agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that reports of the procedures for preparation and audit of annual financial&#13;
statements including project accounts, special accounts and SOEs would be submitted to IDA within&#13;
six months of the close of the fiscal year (para. 5.4). For the on- going Infrastructure Project, the&#13;
required audit reports have been submitted in a generally satisfactory fashion with only a few delays.&#13;
H.    Bank Supervision and Reporting Requirements&#13;
3.31   The project will require close supervision particularly in the first two years of implementation.&#13;
A schedule of supervision missions and indication of expertise required for each mission is provided in&#13;
Annex 3.3. An estimated 10 staff weeks per annum would be required for field missions in FY96/97&#13;
and FY97/98 including 7.5 staff weeks for the mid-term review planned for October 1997. In addition&#13;
to field supervision, about 4 staff weeks per annum would be required for review of procurement&#13;
documents during the early implementation years. A further 3 staff weeks would be required per&#13;
annum over the course of project execution for review of progress reports and financial reports and for&#13;
IDA support for project implementation.&#13;
3.32   Reports detailing the progress of project implementation will be submitted to IDA quarterly,&#13;
and the reporting formats were agreed during negotiations (Para 5.4).  Assurances given during&#13;
negotiations that reporting, auditing and monitoring would be carried out using procedures acceptable&#13;
to IDA and that the reports, quarterly as well as those due within six months of the end of the fiscal&#13;
year, are prepared in a timely manner to ensure their receipt within the agreed time period.&#13;
3.33   GOM would complete and submit a project implementation completion report, in a form&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, not later than six months after the closing date.&#13;

CHAPTER 4. JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Project Benefits and Justification&#13;
4.1    The justification for this credit derives from the economic, social and environmental benefits&#13;
which will accrue to the economy, the people of Malawi, and the natural resource base of the country.&#13;
These benefits include: (i) the provision of infrastructure that will underpin private sector development&#13;
and economic diversification, accompanied by measures aimed at achieving sustainability, efficiency,&#13;
and responsiveness to demand; (ii) increasing the proportion of people with convenient access to safe&#13;
water for domestic use, in a manner that supports community choice, promotes a sense of ownership&#13;
and conserves scarce fiscal resources, thus conferring benefits by improving the lot of women and the&#13;
health status of the community, and alleviating one of the factors contributing to the pervasiveness of&#13;
poverty; and (iii) protecting and enhancing the quality of water resources and associated aquatic and&#13;
terrestrial environments.&#13;
B.    Environmental Impact&#13;
4.2    The proposed environmental classification for the project is B. The environmental effects of&#13;
the project are expected to be positive and beneficial.  Substantially improved water resource&#13;
management to arrest the degradation in water quality and of aquatic environments is an important&#13;
aspect of the project. It is expected also that combining responsibility for water supply and water-borne&#13;
sewerage within the water boards will contribute to more effective prevention of pollution of water&#13;

C.    Riparian Rights&#13;
4.3    The proposed Zomba dam is to be constructed on the Mulunguzi River which empties into&#13;
Lake Chilwa bordered by Malawi and Mozambique. The dam was originally included in the&#13;
Infrastructure Project (Cr. 2069-MAI) and, the Government of Mozambique, after having been duly&#13;
notified by Malawi, gave its no objection to the project. The withdrawal of financial support by a&#13;
number of external support agencies for Malawi in the early 1990s caused the dam not to be&#13;
constructed. The dam is now included in the proposed NWDP and GOM has again notified&#13;
Mozambique of its intent to dam the Mulunguzi River. Besides the Zomba dam, some of the other&#13;
water supplies proposed in the NWDP would abstract raw water from international waterways that&#13;
Malawi shares with Mozambique and Tanzania. GOM has accordingly notified these riparians of the&#13;
project providing relevant hydrological and water quality data to assure them that their interests would&#13;
not be adverse and requesting a positive response on the subject.  Compliance with the Bank's&#13;
guidelines on riparian rights was a condition of Board presentation (para. 5.1).&#13;
D.    Poverty Impact&#13;
4.4   It is expected that the project will have a substantial impact on alleviating poverty in both urban&#13;
and rural areas. The sector has not been able to increase coverage as rapidly as would be desirable&#13;
because of financial and human resource capacity constraints resulting from inappropriate pricing and&#13;
cost-sharing policies, the poor management and incentive structures implicit in the present institutional&#13;
arrangements, and the inadequate orientation of investments to effective demand. The proposed cost-&#13;
sharing policies in the rural program will permit the limited financial resources in the sector to benefit&#13;
the poorest in the communities, as well as those who, although poor by almost any measure, can at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
least afford a small contribution towards the maintenance of the water supply facility of their&#13;
community. The poor in urban and perturbing communities will benefit from the much increased&#13;
incentives and capabilities that the commercially-oriented RWBs will have to provide services of cost&#13;
and technology well matched to the needs and expressed willingness-to-pay of each urban or perturbing&#13;
neighborhood. It is expected that about 1.5 million of those inadequately served currently, most of&#13;
them poor, will get access to improved services as a result of the project.&#13;

In 1993/4 LWB was profitable whereas BWB made a net loss of some 8%. LWB's performance has&#13;
improved over the past ten years partly as a result of the impact of the recently completed Second&#13;
Lilongwe Water Supply Project (Cr. 1742-MAI). The improvements in financial performance which&#13;
have been achieved by LWB and until 1991/2 by BWB, are due to efficiency measures such as&#13;
contracting out some services and reducing staffing levels. BWB's average tariff is higher than LWB's,&#13;
reflecting the high costs of pumping from the Shire River. Thus the key reason why BWB makes&#13;
losses is the high depreciation charges based on the most recent revaluation of assets. LWB has also&#13;
revalued its assets but it has a smaller overall asset base. The performance of DWSF shown above has&#13;
been recalculated based on the asset revaluation recently completed. DWSF has not yet taken the&#13;
decision to incorporate this revaluation into its accounts. Thus, at present, the depreciation charge in&#13;
its income statement is understated and the accounts present an artificially favorable position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
4.6    Financial management.   There are currently 61 accounts staff within DWSF whose&#13;
responsibility is restricted to transaction processing and bookkeeping.  There are no qualified&#13;
accountants amongst these staff. Management information is limited to ad hoc reporting. The existing&#13;
financial management skills within DWSF are not adequate for the operation of a fully commercial&#13;
entity. The major skill gaps are in the areas of management accounting, project management and&#13;
financial and economic analysis. Development of these skills will require a systematic process of&#13;
training and recruitment based on a detailed human resources plan and a training needs analysis.&#13;
Improvement in the capacity for financial management must be supported by the development of new&#13;
systems and procedures.  The current financial systems within DWSF are not adequate for the&#13;
provision of financial information. The systems to be established for the new RWBs will need to be&#13;
capable of both financial and management accounting in an integrated scheme to ensure the stewardship&#13;
of their assets, monitor and record the transactions, and provide management with sufficient&#13;
information with which to manage the business. In spite of these deficiencies, there are several positive&#13;
factors which give good reason for confidence that the RWBs can be successful in financial terms.&#13;
These include: (i) the existence of data gathering capability, (ii) the on-going systematic and reliable&#13;
collection of revenue from a high proportion of customers at tariff levels within range of the levels&#13;
which apply in Lilongwe and Blantyre, (iii) the presence nearby of proven skills in LWB and BWB in&#13;
developing successful water supply services to communities with similar socioeconomic characteristics,&#13;
and (iv) a real rate of return on assets that, while far from satisfactory taking account of under-valued&#13;
assets, indicates a business that can be brought under control. The human resources planning, training&#13;
needs analysis, recruitment and training, and the development, installation and testing of new systems&#13;
and procedures, would be carried out under the guidance of the incoming chairmen and chief&#13;
executives of the RWBs under the National Urban Water Supply Program activity categories entitled&#13;
"Business Planning", "Leadership and Staffing", and "Support as the Boards Come into Operation", as&#13;
described in Chapter 3 above.&#13;
Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.7    Lilongwe and Blantyre Water Boards. The corporate plans for both LWB and BWB show an&#13;
increasing profit trend over the next five years. The major extension of the water supply facilities of&#13;
the LWB, part funded under this project, will have a significant effect on the finances of LWB, as&#13;
shown in Table 4.2 below. The only other impact of this project on LWB and BWB will be the&#13;
proposed transfer to them of responsibility for sewerage services. The tariff for sewerage services will&#13;
be set at a level which is designed to recover the operating costs and no major investment in new&#13;
sewerage assets is anticipated in these cities under this project. The impact of the transfer of sewerage&#13;
services on the financial performance of the LWB and BWB will be therefore negligible. During the&#13;
next five years, both boards may carry out asset revaluation studies which may alter the high&#13;
depreciation charges currently being borne by Blantyre.&#13;
4.8    Regional Boarqds. Key indicators for the future performance of the three new RWBs and LWB&#13;
are given in Annex 4.1 and summarized in the Table 4.2 below. The most important parameters used&#13;
in preparing the financial scenarios are as follows: (i) the agreed performance targets of revenue as a&#13;
percentage of full costs, defined as the cost of operations plus depreciation plus debt servicing, shall be,&#13;
at the end of year 2, 60%; year 3, 80%; year 4, 100%; and (ii) the assumption that by the end of year&#13;
2, operating costs will be reduced by 10% below present operating costs through efficiency&#13;
improvements. Initial tariffs are based on existing levels or increases already approved. In the initial&#13;
years after establishment, the RWBs will not generate a net profit. However, all three RWBs would&#13;
generate an operating profit (before depreciation, interest and tax) by 1997/8 (the third year of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
operation). By the year 1999/2000 (the fifth year of operation) all three RWBs will produce a net&#13;
profit. The institution of improved financial management as discussed above is critical to each RWB's&#13;
ability to manage its own financial performance.&#13;

4.9     Financing.  As far as possible, the new  RWBs will be obliged to operate in a commercial&#13;
environment. To this end, they should bear the full financing costs of the investments in their region&#13;
at commercial rates of interest. However, in many of the schemes, the existing facilities are not&#13;
operationally viable due to a backlog of maintenance work. In addition, some schemes do not currently&#13;
cover populations of adequate size to be commercially viable but require extension. The envisaged&#13;
investments in rehabilitation and extension of the DWSF schemes would remedy the more serious of&#13;
these deficiencies over the investment period. It is also necessary that the RWBs achieve a reasonable&#13;
debt/ equity ratio if they are to operate on a fully commercial basis with the potential, ultimately, to be&#13;
privatized. Thus the finance required for the investment program, 90% of which will be provided to&#13;
GOM by IDA and other donors, will be on-lent to the RWBs using a combination of commercial debt&#13;
and grant funding. The grant funding would become part of the RWB's equity and would not be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
repayable. In the financial forecasts for the RWBs the balance of grant to loan financing has been set&#13;
such that the debt to equity ratio is not worse than 60:40. The loan funding would be at commercial&#13;
terms, in line with market interest rates, and both interest and principal would be paid to GOM in&#13;
accordance with the agreement reached. The interest rate will be set at 2% above the prevailing rate of&#13;
inflation, using the National Composite Retail Price Index published by GOM as the inflation indicator.&#13;
The repayment period is proposed to be 25 years, which is somewhat less than the expected average&#13;
life of the assets created, thus minimizing intergenerational inequity. There will be an initial repayment&#13;
holiday of five years. The repayments adequately cover GOM's commitments for repayment of that&#13;
portion of the IDA credit used for these purposes. These on-lending arrangements would not apply&#13;
either to the share of the DWSF assets provided to each RWB on vesting day, or to the sums made&#13;
available interest free, to each RWB to provide sufficient funds for operating expenses for its first&#13;
three years of operation. The amounts of the DWSF share and requirements for additional funds for&#13;
operating expenses will be calculated in the business planning process and specified in the charter for&#13;
each RWB. The additional funds to be made available by IDA to the RWBs for operating expenses in&#13;
the first three years of operations are estimated to be: NWB, US$200,000; CWB, US$300,000; and&#13;
SWB, US$500,000. The value of the DWSF assets transferred to each RWB will be considered as the&#13;
GOM's initial equity contribution.&#13;
4.10   The Effects of Investments on Tariffs. Table 4.2, Summary of Expected Future Performance,&#13;
shows Rate of Return on Net Assets as an indicator of the increasing financial viability of each Board.&#13;
The information in the table is based on the constant cost financial models for each organization shown&#13;
in Annex 4.1. The average tariff figures show a rising trend due to two factors. First, tariffs are&#13;
currently too low and need to rise some 10% to achieve full cost recovery. Second, although some of&#13;
the proposed investment is desirable in order to increase the customer base of each RWB, the total&#13;
effect of the investment programs on depreciation and debt service cost will be a further increase in&#13;
tariffs of some 10% to 40%. The small reductions in average tariff which occur towards the end of the&#13;
project are due to the increasing proportion of supplies to kiosk and handpump users in low-income&#13;
peri-urban areas. Users of these services are charged at low rates. The single investment with greatest&#13;
impact on a RWB is the Southern RWB's Zomba Dam and Treatment Works. This sub-project has&#13;
increased in costs as expressed in Malawi Kwacha, due to moving the dam site downstream to a more&#13;
expensive site to prevent adverse environmental impacts, and to the devaluation of the currency.&#13;
Earlier studies showed the project to be economically and financially justified but this now needs&#13;
review. Prior to the mid-term review, the economic and financial justification of the sub-project will&#13;
be revisited and it will be re-optimized if necessary, by reviewing its scale and the treatment options.&#13;
In accordance with the policies of the GOM stated in the WRMPS, the project will only be proceeded&#13;
with if economically and financially justified.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
4.11   Fiscal impact. The GOM  is committed to providing 10% of the funding required for the&#13;
proposed investment program as counterpart funds. This commitment is likely to amount to some&#13;
US$9.6 million equivalent over the term of the project. The objective of the project is to establish the&#13;
RWBs in such a way that they do not require GOM subventions to meet operating costs. In addition,&#13;
the RWBs will be expected to make interest payments to GOM and repay the loans thus providing&#13;
funds with which GOM can meet its obligations to the lending agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
F.    Economic Analysis&#13;
4.12   A primary institutional aim of this project is to restructure both urban and rural programs to&#13;
give primary responsibility for assets and investment selection to the Water Boards in urban areas and&#13;
the selection of service technologies and levels to locally proposed projects in rural areas.&#13;
Consequently, only an indicative economic analysis of investment components is feasible at this time.&#13;
The specific investments in the urban and town schemes must be selected by the yet-to-be established&#13;
RWBs as part of their business plans if the desired level of managerial autonomy and demand-&#13;
orientation is to be achieved. Similarly, the investments in the rural program will be determined by the&#13;
users' proposals approved by GOM, rather than predetermined by GOM.&#13;
4.13   There is strong evidence of considerable excess demand in Malawi for increased coverage of&#13;
the population and improved services for those currently served. It is expected that this will continue&#13;
to be the case even at tariffs required to meet financial objectives of the RWBs in urban and town&#13;
schemes. Moreover, there is sufficient excess demand to permit negotiated cost-sharing in rural areas&#13;
to cover O&amp;M costs in all cases and to also cover capital cost in excess of minimum service level costs&#13;
in cases where higher service levels are proposed by specific rural areas. To the extent that this is true,&#13;
there is prima facie evidence that economic benefits exceed costs and are economically justified.&#13;
4.14   These judgments are supported by consultant reports and internal GOM economic analyses on&#13;
the candidate investment packages for the rehabilitation of existing DWSF schemes and typical rural&#13;
gravity-fed system. For the candidate urban investments, primarily rehabilitation, the user benefits&#13;
estimated are of two types: (1) arresting the deterioration of service levels and coverage due to system&#13;
malfunctions and (2) additional service coverage attributable to improvements in production and&#13;
distribution capacity. The incremental service provided is valued at the prices expected as shown in&#13;
Table 4.2. The average IRR for these schemes is estimated to be about 25%. The relative rates of&#13;
return, calculated by the consultants and staff of GOM for the three new RWB service areas are: North&#13;
27%; Central 42%; and South 26%. In rural areas the primary benefits are increased coverage of the&#13;
population which will provide for additional consumption; more convenient access (resulting in time&#13;
savings); and safer water (resulting in health improvement). The average IRR for these rural schemes&#13;
is estimated at about 16%. Moreover, both the financial and economic impacts of investments actually&#13;
chosen by the RWBs and the rural villages will be estimated prior to investment and reviewed annually&#13;
during the implementation of the project. The rates of return estimated by the WD were on average&#13;
16% for candidate Rural Gravity-fed Schemes.&#13;
G.    Risks&#13;
4.15   The proposals for institutional restructuring and the changes in legislation, processes and&#13;
practice, when implemented, are intended to provide an environment in which each organizational unit&#13;
and their managers and employees are surrounded by a consistent set of incentives to achieve their&#13;
performance targets. The GOM is expected to set demanding targets requiring the five WBs and the&#13;
WD to achieve increased coverage, levels of operations and maintenance that result in long lived assets,&#13;
and improved levels of water quality in water resources and supplies. The five WBs are likely to be&#13;
required to cover full costs with income while keeping tariffs to acceptable levels in real terms.&#13;
Achievement of such targets is clearly important to Malawi's social, political and economic progress.&#13;
Yet some of the changes require new attitudes and processes that will be at odds with present&#13;
organizational cultures and long standing practice. Whether the proposed new ways of doing things&#13;
that will be the greatest departure from present norms will be accepted and frlly or pervasively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
implemented, is the major challenge and risk of this program. The issues that are likely to present the&#13;
greatest tests of will and persistence are the following.&#13;
(i)    In the past, water resources management has been administered by enforcement, as is&#13;
common throughout the world. However, this approach is quite unsuited to water&#13;
resources problems where the cause is the inappropriate use of land by significant&#13;
numbers of people, and the best solution is one in which the users of land understand the&#13;
causes of the water and land degradation, and have incentives to find and adopt&#13;
sustainable solutions.   This certainly applies to Malawi's problems of resource&#13;
degradation due to the cultivation of unsuitable land in key catchment areas. Many of the&#13;
subsistence farmers who are now in this situation have been forced into their present&#13;
farming methods and locations by the pressure of population and the scarcity of land for&#13;
traditional farming. Widespread and lasting support for a solution can only be secured&#13;
from these farmers if they themselves have close involvement in the development and&#13;
implementation of the solution. This in turn requires, first, involvement of all the sectors&#13;
within GOM who can assist, and second, a commitment on the part of all concerned&#13;
public sector participants to the practice of stakeholder involvement. Neither of these&#13;
have been the practice in the past, and even with training programs and projects with&#13;
which to put the concept into practice, experience suggests that it is likely to take some&#13;
years for stakeholder involvement to become the normal, habitual way in which new&#13;
initiatives are planned and implemented.&#13;
(ii)    The financial viability and the physical assets of the LWB and BWB have in the past been&#13;
put at risk by inappropriate decisions by the person holding the office of Minister of their&#13;
parent ministry, and by the MSC. Both are empowered and required by the legislation&#13;
which established these agencies to give approval to, or vary, the recommendations of the&#13;
boards on matters of detail such as extensions of mains and appointments of senior staff,&#13;
and matters of importance such as the change in tariff required to increase income in&#13;
response to price inflation. Neither have had the contextual understanding to make such&#13;
decisions, nor could this have been expected of them. These provisions of the legislation&#13;
are inappropriate. It is proposed instead to use new legislation, which will apply to all&#13;
five WBs, to seek to focus the Minister, the WBs and the MSC on roles more consistent&#13;
with the GOM's intentions to ensure the achievement of its objectives. The proposed&#13;
legislation will confer upon the Minister the powers and obligations not to abrogate the&#13;
roles of the WBs, but to set performance targets (after consulting with the WB), to&#13;
monitor progress towards their achievement (with the assistance of the MSC), and to give&#13;
strategic and policy directions regarding their achievement. It now remains to be seen&#13;
whether Parliament will indeed be willing to endorse such a change. This step has not&#13;
frequently been achieved in southern Africa as governments and Parliaments have&#13;
sometimes been unwilling to devolve powers.&#13;
(iii)   The WD, when implementing the proposed new community-driven approach to the&#13;
provision of rural water supplies, will need to institute a number of steps that will involve&#13;
its employees, and the communities with which they deal, in unfamiliar activities&#13;
requiring new attitudes and approaches. The steps in implementing small water supply&#13;
facilities for rural communities will include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(a)    developing a set of rules and procedures, with the aid of a Consultative Council&#13;
consisting of some representatives of conmnunities that will potentially be&#13;
recipients of these services;&#13;
(b)    mobilizing conununities to identify their priorities and make choices;&#13;
(c)    pioviding technical and costing advice to communities, and coordinating this with&#13;
assistance and advice from other agencies like education and health;&#13;
(d)    calling and awarding bulked-up contracts to well construction contractors to give&#13;
communities access to relatively inexpensive implementation options;&#13;
(e)    ensuring that contracts for construction and for the training of members of the&#13;
communities in maintenance, are successfully completed; and&#13;
(f)    making payment to contractors promptly.&#13;
This change from the present approach to one of closer consultation with the communities will be a&#13;
challenge not only for the WD but also for many of the rural comnmunities of Malawi. The social and&#13;
political hierarchy in Malawi was characterized by an authoritarian structure down to and including village&#13;
level and more democratic structures and processes will take time to permeate society.  Gaining&#13;
acceptance of stakeholder involvement as the normal mode of implementing small-scale rural water&#13;
supplies will require consistent effort and support both by the WD and GOM itself, and in some areas will&#13;
be a controversial and laborious process.&#13;
4.16   The investment components, with the exception of the Zomba Dam, are well tested and&#13;
frequently used in Malawi and pose no significant technical or environmental risks. The Zomba Dam&#13;
has separately undergone an envir-onnmental assessment, that has been already accepted by the Bank,&#13;
and does not pose any major environmental or technical risks.&#13;

NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Executive Summary of Water Resources Management Policy and Strategies&#13;
1.    The need for a Water Resources Management Policy and Strategies.  The water&#13;
resources of Malawi are relatively abundant. They are, however, coming under increasing&#13;
pressure. Land use is intensifying, causing increased demand and a range of actual and&#13;
potential threats to the quality and availability of water. At the same time, water supply and&#13;
water-borne sanitation services are proving difficult not only to extend to meet the needs of&#13;
communities in a number of areas, but also to sustain in good operating condition.&#13;
2.    The water sector is at a turning point. Unless new and pro-active approaches to water&#13;
resources management and the provision of water services are developed and adopted, the&#13;
water sector will increasingly be characterized by water services which fail to provide&#13;
effectively and efficiently for an increasing proportion of the population, and by water&#13;
resources that in a number of areas will be degraded in quality.&#13;
3.    A coherent set of policies guiding the management of water resources and the efficient&#13;
and responsive provision of water services, supported by strategies and proposals for change to&#13;
ensure their implementation can provide a route to a new and positive future for the water&#13;
sector in Malawi, and for all those who benefit from it.&#13;
Policy Framework&#13;
4.    A set of statements of policy are proposed, to guide the sustainable management of&#13;
water resources and the provision of services. They cover:&#13;
(a)   the management, and use of water for conservation and environmental&#13;
protection and for the benefit of the community:&#13;
(b)   stakeholder involvement;&#13;
(c)   the allocation of water;&#13;
(d)   the investment of public funds; and&#13;
(e)    pricing.&#13;
5.    They prescribe how decisions should be made on the management of water resources&#13;
and the planning and provision of services, to secure maximum benefit for all those who may&#13;
be affected, and to ensure that water resources are well managed and protected.&#13;

Overview of the Water and Sanitation Sector&#13;
6.    It is only from an understanding of the status and condition of the water resources of&#13;
Malawi, and of water and water-borne sanitation services to its communities, that a true&#13;
assessment can be made of the problems that resources and services face and of the&#13;
opportunities for the solution.  The geographical distribution of surface and groundwater&#13;
resources, the current status of their development and use, and adverse effects on water quality&#13;
resulting from inappropriate land use, indicate that Malawi's water resources although&#13;
relatively abundant, are coming under pressure in some areas.&#13;
7.     Malawi infrastructure providing water supply and water-borne sanitation services is&#13;
characterized by rapidly growing demand and difficulty in ensuring the financial and physical&#13;
sustainability of existing schemes.&#13;
8.     The legal and regulatory structure for water resources management, the institutional&#13;
and organizational arrangements under which the water sector operate, the pricing and tariff&#13;
arrangements, the practice for most water supply systems of providing funding from central&#13;
government sources rather than from those benefiting directly from the service, are all&#13;
arrangements and practices which, though no doubt appropriate in days gone by, act today&#13;
often to discourage effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness to the needs of the community.&#13;
9.     Degradation of water quality is resulting from increased suspended solids and turbidity,&#13;
caused by deforestation and inappropriate land use. Inadequate sanitation and waste disposal&#13;
arrangements in many settlements are resulting in increasing of contamination of water&#13;
resources, with potential risks to human health. Improper application of agricultural and&#13;
hazardous chemicals in industrial wastes, also present risks of contamination of receiving&#13;
waters. The legal and institutional arrangements for national environmental, management have&#13;
been recognized as needing to be upgraded to enable more effective management of&#13;
multi-sectoral environmental issues.&#13;
Strategies&#13;
10.    Ojectives. The status and condition of water resources and water services clearly&#13;
indicate the need for a set of strategies that provide new directions to the water sector, guiding&#13;
all investment and management initiatives. The challenges which the water sector face are a&#13;
result of many factors which make it difficult to exercise good husbandry of water resources&#13;
and to provide efficient, responsive water services. The challenges can be overcome by&#13;
developing and following a complementary set of strategies which ensure that all investment&#13;
and management decisions act in concert towards the development of a stronger, more efficient&#13;
and self-reliant sector.&#13;
11.   It will be helpful in formulating the strategies and consequent actions to have in mind a&#13;
set of objectives for the water sector which reflect values widely shared by the community and&#13;
accepted by the government. these can be briefly stated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
(a)    Community Services. To ensure that all citizens of Malawi have and will&#13;
continue to have convenient access to water in sufficient quantity and of&#13;
adequate quality for basic domestic needs, and to have available adequate&#13;
sanitation;&#13;
(b)    Economic Development. To provide water infrastructure and services that will&#13;
underpin the economic development of all sectors of the economy and to do so&#13;
in the most economically efficient manner; and&#13;
(c)    EnirQnmone. To preserve and enhance aquatic and riparian environment.&#13;
Institutional Development and Capacity Building&#13;
12.   The opportunity now exists to implement a number of institutional adjustments and a&#13;
determined program of capacity building over the next few years. The institutions of the sector&#13;
should be structured to create a consistent environment of incentives which encourages all the&#13;
organizations to achieve good performance, and ensures accountability to the government and&#13;
to the recipients of services. A strategy for capacity development is also required, leading the&#13;
organizations to carry out their tasks in accordance with their charters, to develop and maintain&#13;
the skills of their people and to deploy them to undertake those tasks efficiently and effectively.&#13;
13.   The strategy for institutional development and capacity building accordingly consists of&#13;
a set of initiatives which establishes an appropriate act of organizations, each growing in&#13;
capacity and contributing to an evolving self-sufficiency and confidence to achieve quality,&#13;
sustainable services. The initiatives proposed are the following:&#13;
(a)    The Water Resources Board to be strengthened as a high level body responsible&#13;
for the management of the water resources of the nation and constituting the&#13;
prime source of policy advice to the Government on water resource&#13;
management issues. The results are a desirable separation of policy resources&#13;
management from operations:&#13;
(i)    Decentralizing the water service activities of the Water Department,&#13;
and moving towards establishing them as commercially oriented&#13;
government-owned water boards, responsive to the needs of the&#13;
communities served.&#13;
(ii)    Developing a sustainable capacity by adopting and working towards&#13;
targets of self-sufficiency in the planning and execution of a significant&#13;
proportion of water projects.&#13;
(iii)    Strengthening the central services such as hydrology, hydrogeology,&#13;
scientific and laboratory services and planning and design. An&#13;
important strength to be established is the evaluation of investment&#13;
proposals and the assessment of sector performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Strategy for Environmental Management&#13;
14.   The institutional arrangements for environmental management for the nation generally,&#13;
but particularly to coordinate and provide strategies direction for all sectors that affect the&#13;
water environment,. need to be strengthened. It is proposed that a national environmental&#13;
regulatory authority be established, to take charge of research in environmental affairs and be&#13;
provided with adequate legislative support. This will provide the capacity to assess the status of&#13;
the environment, propose and coordinate environmental management, environment impact&#13;
assessment process independent of the operational organizations within the various sectors of&#13;
the economy, which at times may be seen to have wasted interests in proposals or operations&#13;
which may adversely affect the environment.&#13;
The Value of Water&#13;
15.    The development of strategies for the efficient allocation of water, for investment to&#13;
create new assets to provide water services, and for pricing, all require a common approach to&#13;
the value of water. It should be recognized that water has not only a social value, but also an&#13;
economic value, both at the point of use, and at its source.&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
16.   Water-borne sanitation services require substantial upgrading and extension.  The&#13;
responsibility for water-borne sanitation should be integrated into the water sector. This will&#13;
provide consistent policy direction and enable the development of a strategy for upgrading and&#13;
further extending these services. Existing water-borne sanitation services which are provided&#13;
by local government should be taken over by the Water Boards for greater efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Allocation of Investment&#13;
17.    A strategy for the allocation of investment is provided. This provides on approach to&#13;
ensuring that scarce financial resources available for investment, are deployed so as to achieve&#13;
maximum sustainable benefit for the community.&#13;
Stakeholder Involvement&#13;
18.    A strategy for stakeholder involvement in the development of all proposals for water&#13;
services and facilities will be aimed at better matching services with community needs and&#13;
willingness to pay.&#13;
Water Allocation&#13;
19.   A strategy for water allocation is one which seeks to maximize benefits through a&#13;
"market" approach to ensuring that water allocation assigned to uses that have economic benefit&#13;
as the primary objective, can be made available through market mechanisms for the most&#13;
beneficial uses. The strategy also ensures that allocations are determined and reserved for&#13;
purposes such as for environmental protection that is difficult to ensure through market forces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
Pricing&#13;
20.   A pricing strategy will be to provide an incentive framework for ensuring financial&#13;
sustainability of sector institutions and of the capital base of the industry and a mechanism to&#13;
ensure efficiency in operations and the matching of service with willingness to pay.&#13;
Required Changes&#13;
21.   In conclusion a set of change required to implement the policies and strategies are&#13;
proposed as described below:&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
22.   Change are required in four areas regarding institutional arrangements of the water and&#13;
sanitation sectors.&#13;
(a)    The prime role of policy advice on water resources management should be&#13;
undertaken by a central policy making body, established by reconstructing and&#13;
upgrading the functions of the Water Resources Board. Membership of the&#13;
Water Resources Board will include stakeholder representation as well as the&#13;
highest level representation from other ministries in order to facilitate in the&#13;
spot decision making.&#13;
(b)    In order to increase efficiency and promote user satisfaction, decentralization of&#13;
implementation and operational functions of the Water Department will be put&#13;
in place as soon as is practical by forming three government owned regional&#13;
water boards.&#13;
(c)    The responsibility for water-borne sanitation will be integrated into the water&#13;
sector. Sanitation activities will be undertaken by the local water boards in&#13;
order to address current operational deficiencies .&#13;
(d)    It is proposed that a national environmental regulatory authority be established&#13;
to look into research on enviromnental affairs and be provided with adequate&#13;
legislative support, that all policies and activities affecting water supplies,&#13;
sanitation and aquatic life are coordinated and integrated.&#13;
Capacity Building&#13;
23.   Capacity building is an area requiring major emphasis in order to achieve the following&#13;
targets and objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
(a)    To ensure sustainable development of water services undertakings in the area of&#13;
the planning and implementation of schemes and in operation and maintenance,&#13;
targets have been set such that by the year 1999-2000 greater than 50% of all&#13;
projects to implement new water and sanitation schemes or rehabilitate existing&#13;
systems should be, carried out by Malawian human resources, without the need&#13;
for foreign-sourced technical assistance.&#13;
(b)   In the area of human resources development every effort should be made to&#13;
ensure a continued upgrading of the skills and expertise of all staff in water and&#13;
sanitation agencies.&#13;
(c)    There is need to strengthen the existing capabilities in the Water Department in&#13;
order to provide a full set of key central services to the water industry.&#13;
Stakeholder Involvement&#13;
24.   The involvement of stakeholders will become the normal procedure in the development&#13;
of the sector. This will ensure maximum participation and a sense of ownership which will in&#13;
turn contribute to the efficiency, sustainability and success of projects, as local stakeholders&#13;
often have more detailed knowledge of the local areas which may not be available to the&#13;
agencies implementing or financing the projects.&#13;
Water Management&#13;
25.   In the area of water management there is need to develop an integrated approach that&#13;
will guide the allocation of water the allocation of investment and the pricing of water services.&#13;
These strategies aim at achieving maximum net benefit to Malawi from its water resources&#13;
while recognizing both the social and economic value of water. The overall result will be that,&#13;
except in unusual cases of need, users will be expected to pay the full cost of the services in&#13;
cash or in kind.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
26.   It is important therefore that all those concerned with the financing and implementation&#13;
of water and sanitation projects be made aware of the policy framework and strategies&#13;
promulgated in this document and play a part in putting them into effect.&#13;
27.   Adherence to these strategies will result in very substantial improvements in the&#13;
coverage, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of water services throughout the nation&#13;
and in the conservation and management of its water resources for the benefit of the present&#13;
and future generations.&#13;

MALAWI&#13;
NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
A.    Institutional Reform and Studies&#13;
1.    This component comprises (i) the reconstitution of the WRB; (ii) the establishment of three&#13;
conumercially-oriented RWBs serving all urban areas other than Lilongwe and Blantyre; (iii)&#13;
restructuring of the WD and strengthening of some of its central services; (iv) transfer of water-borne&#13;
sanitation from MLG to the water boards; (v) rural water supply program; and (vi) water resources and&#13;
environmental studies.&#13;
Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building&#13;
2.    Water Resources Board. Reconstituting the WRB involves administrative directives specifying&#13;
new TOR, appointment of a high level multidisciplinary membership at Permanent Secretary and Head&#13;
of Agency level, with representation from the private sector, and appropriate skills support. The&#13;
adoption by GOM of the WRMPS, with its emphasis on stakeholder involvement as the methodology to&#13;
be used for water resources management where communities affect or are affected by water resources&#13;
problems, provides the WRB with both the opportunity and the obligation to ensure that this effective&#13;
and sustainable approach is implemented. Implementation of the WRMPS would remove the WD's&#13;
potential conflict of interest in both performing operational functions, and being required to advise&#13;
GOM on the regulation of its own activities. Measures within the WRMPS would be aimed at&#13;
establishing the WRB (i) as a more effective policy advisory entity to GOM; (ii) as a body more&#13;
representative of the key stakeholders concemed with the management of water resources and their&#13;
utilization; and (iii) as appropriately structured and supported to deal with water resource protection,&#13;
allocation, pricing and other key policy issues&#13;
3.    The project supports this component through the provision of (i) TA in institutional reform and&#13;
restructuring supporting the establishment of the new institutional arrangements, and the strengthening&#13;
of the central service roles of the WD, which will provide technical and scientific support services to&#13;
the WRB; (ii) support for the procurement and installation of a GIS system, a function of which will be&#13;
the support of water resources management and infrastructure planners; (iii) materials and equipment&#13;
supporting the strengthening of central services; and (iv) staff training and development in resource&#13;
management and central services.&#13;
4.    Regional Water Roards. Responsibility for all urban water services (other than those provided&#13;
by the LWB and the BWB) will be transferred from the WD to three newly created RWBs. They will&#13;
be. set up on a commercial basis to improve the demand focus of water supply programs, and to&#13;
strengthen the sustainability of water services through a shift to conunercial practices by the RWBs.&#13;
The RWBs will share the assets of the DWSF schemes, and their market areas will initially consist of&#13;
the medium sized cities, small towns and institutions currently being served by the DWSF schemes.&#13;
This component comprises: (a) legislation that: (i) establishes the RWBs; and (ii) assigns functions,&#13;
powers and obligations to the RWBs (providing at the same time an improved set of these for the LWB&#13;
and BWB); (b) identification and valuation of assets and liabilities, determination of financial structure,&#13;
and assessment of requirements for materials, plant and equipment; (c) preparation of business plans by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-                                  Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
each of the RWBs; (d) preparation of charters, to include performance agreements between GOM and&#13;
the RWBs; (e) preparation and implementation of organization and staffing plans that clarify internal&#13;
responsibilities and include: (i) downsizing and/or rationalization of staffing arrangements; and (ii)&#13;
detailed training programs; (f) design and implementation of improved financial management,&#13;
including: (i) satisfactory financial and accounting systems and procedures; (ii) tariff-setting and cost-&#13;
recovery practices; (g) adopting performance targets; and (h) preparation of indicative five and detailed&#13;
rolling two-year investment programs, including detailed design of annual plans.&#13;
5.     The project supports this component through (a) the provision of TA in institutional reform and&#13;
restructuring; (b) the funding of studies to determine business and human resource plans and other&#13;
requirements of the RWBs; (c) the funding of training and staff development programs in the&#13;
managerial, technical and financial skills of operation of commercially oriented water entities; (d) the&#13;
provision of the initial working capital requirements of each RWB; and (e) the provision of business&#13;
and technical information systems (including accounting, billing, customer inquiry and a common GIS&#13;
system for asset management and planning).&#13;
6.     Water Department Central Services. The operational responsibilities of the WD - primarily,&#13;
under the proposed institutional arrangements, the implementation of the Rural Water Supply Program&#13;
-- will be decentralized to regional offices of the department and down-sized. The remainder of the&#13;
WD will be restructured to provide a defined set of central support functions, most of which will be&#13;
strengthened also by this project. The principal functions of the WD's central services units will be to:&#13;
(i) perform the proposal review and negotiation process of local rural proposals and to monitor and&#13;
assess the performance of the program on an on-going basis; (ii) provide technical support to the WRB&#13;
and the three RWBs, including assessment of the quality and quantity of surface and groundwater&#13;
resources; (iii) monitor progress with the implementation of policy; (iv) assist GOM to set standards&#13;
and performance targets; (v) monitor compliance with standards and performance targets.&#13;
7.     The project supports this component through (a) TA in leading and organizing processes,&#13;
community-driven service provision, and in institutional reform and restructuring including support for&#13;
the downsizing and restructuring, and for the strengthening of some of the central services of the WD;&#13;
(b) staff training, development in the range of central services including field services in hydrology,&#13;
hydrogeology, and appropriate procedures and methods for sampling and testing water quality; and (c)&#13;
a share to be agreed of the finding of initial working capital requirements including materials, plant&#13;
and equipment including appropriate water testing equipment and systems.&#13;
8.     Lilongwe and Rlantyre Water Boards. LWB and BWB are to have their corporate relationships&#13;
with GOM changed from the present one in which the legislation provides very close and detailed&#13;
oversight by the Minister and the DSB, to relationships more appropriate to well-performed&#13;
commercial entities. Less detailed oversight needs to be balanced by arrangements for performance&#13;
target-setting, monitoring and reporting, enabling the Minister to exercise the strategic oversight&#13;
appropriate to his or her responsibility as principal shareholder. This component, therefore, consists of&#13;
support for (i) the development of the proposals for the legislation which will establish the RWBs and&#13;
put in place a consistent and performance based relationship between GOM and each of the five water&#13;
boards, drawing upon the experience to date of the LWB and the BWB; and (ii) for the establishment of&#13;
business planning and performance monitoring and reporting arrangements for all five-boards.&#13;
9.     The project supports this component through (a) TA in institutional reform and restructuring,&#13;
and in business planning, and (b) staff training and development in financial management and technical&#13;
aspects of water supply infrastructure services.&#13;

10.    Water-Borne Sanitation Services. This component comprises (a) the administrative measures of&#13;
transferring responsibility for all aspects of water-borne sanitation services from MLG to MIWD; (b)&#13;
studies to prepare for the transfers including studies of assets and liabilities associated with existing&#13;
services, essential rehabilitation works, including measures to reduce to acceptable levels pollution&#13;
resulting from untreated discharges and overflows, the preparation of business plans, human resources&#13;
plans, and initial requirements for facilities, plant and equipment, and the scheduling of transfer events&#13;
and activities; (d) agreement on performance targets, monitoring and reporting; and (e) the transfer&#13;
events and activities themselves. The transfer will take place within two years of credit effectiveness.&#13;
I.    The project supports this component through (a) TA in institutional reform and restructuring,&#13;
accounting and associated business systems, and in appropriate technology for the treatment of sewage&#13;
and the disposal of treated effluent; (b) staff training and development in environmental, technical and&#13;
business aspects of wastewater services; and (c) a share to be agreed of initial working capital&#13;
requirements for this service including initial requirement for materials, plant and equipment, and&#13;
business and technical information systems.&#13;
Rural Water Supply Reform&#13;
12.    Rural Water Program. Responsibility for services in small areas and villages will continue to&#13;
be based in the WD in the near termn, rather than being transferred immediately to the RWBs. GOM&#13;
has adopted, however, two major changes in the way this responsibility will be exercised. First, as&#13;
cities and towns served by the DWSF schemes develop and expand, it is expected that the RWBs will&#13;
expand their service areas to include existing peri-urban and nearby rural areas, currently considered&#13;
part of the rural water program. Second, the WD will restructure all existing rural water supply&#13;
programs into a consolidated rural program (see more detailed discussion in Annex 2.2), based on a set&#13;
of widely promulgated rules, which will be developed with stakeholder involvement through a&#13;
consultative council, and which will emphasize local demand for services.  In the program,&#13;
improvement schemes will be undertaken in response to locally initiated proposals and only after&#13;
satisfactory negotiations have established the relative responsibilities of the local area and GOM for&#13;
payment of capital and O&amp;M costs. GOM's share in the costs of improved service will be restricted to&#13;
no more than the national average per capita costs of a minimum service level provided through a hand&#13;
pump. The proposing local area will provide for O&amp;M costs in all cases and any capital costs in excess&#13;
of this minimum.&#13;
13.    These same principles of community driven provision of local infrastructure have been&#13;
incorporated into the proposed Barnk-assisted MASAP. Many rural communities that do not have&#13;
convenient access to safe water supplies are likely to place the provision of new safe water supplies&#13;
high on their list of priorities for facilities to be provided under MASAP arrangements. The provision&#13;
of small rural water supplies will therefore be an essential part of the MASAP's menu of options for&#13;
these communities. Accordingly, the proposed MASAP will incorporate a large proportion of the&#13;
program for the provision of new boreholes, together with a range of associated options for small local&#13;
water supplies.&#13;
14.    The project supports the Rural Water Supply Program through (a) TA  in developing and&#13;
organizing community-driven approaches to the provision of water services, (b) funding a prioritized&#13;
program of hydrogeological and hydrological assessment and mapping to provide an information base&#13;
available to communities, and (c) funding of the construction of new rural water supply facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

including new boreholes, and gravity-fed schemes, and the rehabilitation of existing boreholes and&#13;
gravity-fed schemes, developed through similar community-driven processes.&#13;
Studies&#13;
15.    This component comprises the following studies:&#13;
(a)    Lake Malawi Level Control: The fluctuations in levels and flows in the Lake Malawi&#13;
and Shire River system are of major concern and of extreme importance to the&#13;
Malawian economy. The system provides water resources for:&#13;
(i)    power generation;&#13;
(ii)    irrigated agriculture;&#13;
(iii)    water supplies to lakeshore towns and settlements;&#13;
(iv)    navigation;&#13;
(v)    coastal bio-habitat;&#13;
(vi)    recreational (tourism) infrastructure; and&#13;
(vii)    fishery development.&#13;
It is proposed under this component to carry out a study to develop a coordinated plan&#13;
for the efficient regulation and management of the Lake Malawi and Shire River&#13;
System balancing regional and multi-sectoral interests. To achieve this objective, the&#13;
following will be undertaken: (i) review regional interests and individual sector&#13;
objectives and assess the natural resources; (ii) develop models capable of determining&#13;
physical impacts and risks of proposed control measures; (iii) examine available&#13;
measures for regulation and identify alternative regulation plans reflecting different&#13;
objectives, given natural constraints;(iv) develop a multi-objective planning model, to&#13;
assess at pre-feasibility level, cost, benefit and impacts; (v) compare and discuss the full&#13;
implications of alternative regulation plans; (vi) examine and suggest an adequate&#13;
institutional framework for future management and monitoring; and (vii) train&#13;
counterpart staff to manage and update the regulation plan.&#13;
(b)    Seawatch for Lake Malawi - This component involves the installation of an&#13;
automatic data collection and transmission system for use in environmental monitoring,&#13;
water resources assessment, navigation (Lake transportation system), fishery&#13;
development and maritime research. The transportation system will benefit from&#13;
reliable data on wind speeds and directions, currents and wave height; temperatures,&#13;
currents, temperature profiles, oxygen and algae concentrations are important elements&#13;
of the fish habitat. Knowledge of these;parameters is essential to promote fishery&#13;
development; and hydrological parameters such as direct rainfall at and evaporation&#13;
from the lake surface are indispensable for proper water balance calculations, and thus&#13;
improved water level forecasting and control.&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 8&#13;
(c)    Flood Forecasting for Lower Shire Valley - Phase 11: - Under this component it is&#13;
intended to follow up the UNDP/WMO project, "Flood Forecasting and Warning&#13;
System for the Lower Shire Valley" in order to improve the forecasting and issue of&#13;
warning of impending floods in good time to allow timely evacuation of the population&#13;
and implementation of other precautionary measures. It will consolidate the Water&#13;
Department's capacity to develop national expertise to efficiently operate and maintain&#13;
the system. It will also provide improvement to the existing system installed during&#13;
Phase 1. At present, the flood forecasting model and warming procedures have not yet&#13;
been commissioned. The following will be carried out under this project:  (i)&#13;
completion and commissioning of Phase I; (ii) improved quality of rainfall and water&#13;
level data to be achieved through improvement of the existing telemetry system; (iii)&#13;
acquisition of data from un-gauged parts of the Upper Shire catchment; and (iv)&#13;
detailed mapping of flood-prone areas.&#13;
(d)    Feasibility Studies for Songwe River Training: This involves a pre-feasibility study to&#13;
solve the problems of underutilization of land and water resources due to the&#13;
continuously changing course of the Songwe River, which forms the border between&#13;
Malawi and Tanzania, and of flooding. The study aims at a multipurpose basin-wide&#13;
development including hydropower generation and agricultural and fishery&#13;
development once the river course has been stabilized and the water resources&#13;
controlled.&#13;
16.   The project supports this component through the provision of credit, the strengthening of the&#13;
central services of the WD, and the institutional restructuring initiative re-establishing and&#13;
strengthening the WRB as the entity responsible for water resources management and the provision of&#13;
policy advice to GOM in relation to the water sector.&#13;
B.    Investment Components&#13;
17.   The proposed five year investment program consists of (a) physical works and (b) goods and&#13;
equipment. Physical works comprise rehabilitation and extension of existing and provision of new&#13;
water supply and sewerage systems. Specifically:&#13;
(a)    Physical Works&#13;
Rehabilitation&#13;
(i)    The objective of rehabilitation is to restore existing schemes to&#13;
their design capacity and performance and arrest further deterioration brought&#13;
about by inadequate maintenance. This would comprise 8 urban water schemes&#13;
requiring improvement to intake structures, repair and/or replacement of&#13;
treatment units, transmission mains and distribution pipes and defective meters&#13;
and identification of alternative sources of supply where the existing sources&#13;
are inadequate or unreliable. For the rural schemes, partial rehabilitation of&#13;
3,000 boreholes comprising replacement of old pumps with standardized&#13;
VLOM-type pumps and necessary repairs or new construction of aprons,&#13;
washing slabs and soakaways; full rehabilitation of 2,500 boreholes comprising&#13;
desilting, replacement of screens and casings with uPVC ones where necessary,&#13;
replacement of existing handpumps with standardized VLOM-type pumps and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-                                  Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
repairs or construction of new aprons, washing slabs and soakaways.&#13;
Communities will be mobilized to take over maintenance responsibilities for the&#13;
boreholes (selected villagers will be trained), hygiene education and sanitation&#13;
promotion programs carried out; and repairs or replacement of transmission&#13;
mains and distribution systems and storage tanks will be carried out for 5&#13;
gravity-fed piped rural schemes.&#13;
(ii)    Water resources works would include soil conservation and slope stabilization&#13;
measures in selected catchments (Lunyangwa River, Chifuga/Chitete Rivers,&#13;
Mpamadzi/Mariku Rivers, Mwanza River and Mzimba River).   These&#13;
measures will comprise restricting cultivation on steep river banks and other&#13;
unsuitable locations, revegetation and farmer education in 15 catchrnent basins&#13;
to alleviate soil degradation, and preserve the quality of water in unprotected&#13;
basins used as sources of raw potable water.&#13;
Extension&#13;
(iii)    The objective of extension is to increase the capacity of existing urban water&#13;
supply systems.  In the project, production and distribution facilities of 29&#13;
urban water schemes, in addition to Zomba and Lilongwe, will be augmented&#13;
to meet increasing water demand projected to the year 2005 and to serve areas&#13;
within townships that are presently not served. For schemes with ground water&#13;
source, site investigations to locate suitable aquifers will be carried out and a&#13;
required number of boreholes to meet projected demand drilled. The boreholes&#13;
will be equipped with electrosubmersible pumps and additional reinforced&#13;
concrete storage tanks will be constructed together with chlorination facilities.&#13;
For schemes with surface water sources, additional sedimentation and rapid&#13;
gravity filter units with pumping and chlorination facilities will be constructed&#13;
to meet increasing demand. Improved intake works will be provided at most of&#13;
the lakeshore schemes.&#13;
(iv)    Zomba Water Supply including the Dam: The objectives of this component of&#13;
the project include:&#13;
*  improving the intake system mainly through the construction of a new dam;&#13;
*  improving and expanding the treatment capacity;&#13;
*  augmentation and expansion of the main pipeline;&#13;
*  rehabilitation and extension of the distribution system; and&#13;
*  installation of new fire hydrants and new booster stations.&#13;
The project goals are to install, maintain and operate a reliable water supply&#13;
system in the Municipality of Zomba to serve both the existing customers and&#13;
potential customers within the planned municipal boundaries. The project will&#13;
involve the construction of: (i) a new dam on the Mulunguzi River,.The Zomba&#13;
dam -- a 47m high rock-fill dam with a conventional sealing core zone of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-                                  Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
selected earthfill and impounding a reservoir with a gross capacity of 3.4&#13;
million m3 on the Lower Mulunguzi River about 70m downstream  of the&#13;
existing small dam. The dam will have a full concrete side-channel spillway&#13;
with 357m3 per sec. discharge capacity. The water will be released into the&#13;
existing natural stream in a controlled manner to augment the existing reservoir&#13;
downstream from which the water will be abstracted, treated and distributed&#13;
through several service reservoirs; and construction and/or rehabilitation of: (ii)&#13;
two steel tanks each of 250m3 capacity; (iii) 11 reinforced concrete tanks with&#13;
capacity varying from 250m3 to 1,500rm3; (iv) two flat-bottomed sedimentation&#13;
tanks; (v) four rapide gravity sand filters; (vi) one clear water collecting tank&#13;
(774m3 storage capacity); (vii) one treatment works building; (viii) access&#13;
road to the existing treatment plant; (ix) existing mechanical and electrical&#13;
equipment in the treatment plant; (x) new main pipeline totaling 41.4km; (xi)&#13;
138km of primary and secondary pipeline system of which 108.4km will serve&#13;
the hydraulic network pipeline; (xii) 83 new fire hydrants; (xiii) 3 kw booster&#13;
pumps; and (xiv) three settling ponds.&#13;
New Schemes&#13;
(v)    The objective of new schemes is to provide service to presently unserved or&#13;
inadequately served areas. This component of the project would include 7&#13;
urban and 6 gravity-fed piped rural systems, 750 boreholes, sewerage systems&#13;
for two urban areas and construction at 9 suitably located sites for controlled&#13;
disposal of septage and sludge. New Boreholes: 165 mm in diameter with&#13;
depths varying from 30 to 50 m will be drilled.  110 mmn diameter uPVC&#13;
lining/screens will be installed and the annulus around them filled with selected&#13;
gravel-pack, followed by development and testing to determine yields. Village&#13;
Level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM) - type Afridev pumps will then be&#13;
installed on properly-constructed plinths and drainage and soakaway provided&#13;
together with twin-level washing slabs. For each new borehole site, the&#13;
benefiting community will be mobilized for establishment of VLOM system and&#13;
selection and training of caretakers. Health education and sanitation promotion&#13;
will also be instituted as part of the VLOM system and will be executed with&#13;
assistance from the Ministry of Health.&#13;
(vi)   New Gravity-Fed Rural Water Supply Schemes:-Under this&#13;
component, gravity-fed water supply schemes will be established at six rural&#13;
sites where the topography is suitable for water supplies by gravity from&#13;
protected catchments. Feasibility studies to determine minimum flows,&#13;
bacteriological and chemical quality of the water, treatment requirements and&#13;
other details will be carried out to confirmn the results of preliminary surveys&#13;
and pre-feasibility studies prior to detailed design and implementation. For all&#13;
schemes, river intakes in the form of weirs to divert water will be constructed&#13;
in protected catchment areas. Reinforced concrete storage tanks will be&#13;
constructed at strategic locations for night-flow storage and a pipe distribution&#13;
network provided.&#13;
(vii)    Sludge Disposal Sites: This component encompasses the construction of nine&#13;
sludge disposal sites, comprising anaerobic ponds for settling and stabilization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-                                Annex 2.1&#13;

of sludge to reduce environmental degradation. The sites will be strategically&#13;
located to serve a number of urban and semi-urban centers and maintained and&#13;
operated to make increasing use of private contractors for emptying of septic&#13;
tanks and pit latrines.&#13;
(b)    Goods and Equipment&#13;
18.   Goods and equipment would include electrical and mechanical plant for treatment works, pipes&#13;
for transmission and reticulation systems, plant and equipment for stores, workshops and laboratories;&#13;
office equipment, telecommunication equipment, computers, water meters, meter testing and repair&#13;
equipment, leakage detection and water quality testing equipment, vehicles and motor bikes and&#13;

MALAWI&#13;
NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Rural Water Supply Reform&#13;
Community Driven Provision of Village-Scale Water Infrastructure&#13;
Implementation Processes&#13;
1.    EIcitinzg. au . Communities will be notified by the GOM, in accordance with&#13;
procedures established under the Social Action Fund, that the opportunity will be available to&#13;
them to determine their priorities for infrastructure or other investment, and that if the&#13;
commnunity is able to show that eligibility requirements are met, the GOM will ensure that their&#13;
highest priority need is met. Eligibility criteria that will apply to all types of infrastructure,&#13;
will include: (i) funds will only be provided where there is a demonstrated and sustainable&#13;
poverty alleviation effect; (ii) funding provided will be limited, not substantially above the&#13;
average cost of the provision of the facility throughout Malawi; (iii) the community can&#13;
demonstrate that it is in a position to continue to operate and maintain the facility, and pay for&#13;
any extras additional to those for which funding will be provided. The following processes for&#13;
preparations to ensure that the facilities are provided efficiently, and for providing the facilities,&#13;
apply both to requests to the govermnent's Social Action Fund agents for water supply&#13;
infrastructure, and to requests direct to the Water Department (such as replacement of a failed&#13;
well).&#13;
2.     Preparing an Environment for Efficient Provision of Water Facilities consistent with&#13;
SAE. Provision for low-cost, bulked-up boreholes or other small-scale water facilities such as&#13;
minor reticulation from large-yield boreholes, will be arranged through calling tenders for&#13;
"rates" contracts. Tenders will be called by the Water Department for contractors to submit&#13;
unit rates for the provision of the following, in quantities of say 250:&#13;
(a)    drilling, casing and fitting the screen for a borehole at a site specified by a&#13;
village Water Committee;&#13;
(b)    equipping the borehole with a pump (Afridev or other options to be specified);&#13;
(c)    constructing the concrete surround/apron, washing slab, and optionally, a&#13;
drainage line, animal drinking trough, and/or limited pipework if required;&#13;
(d)    providing a set of tools and a few basic spares;&#13;
(e)    providing training in maintenance; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(f)    all of this to be in compliance with standards of materials and workmanship,&#13;
and within time limits, as specified in the contract documents.&#13;
3.    The successful contractors will enter into: (i) for SAF-initiated water proposals, a three-&#13;
party contractual agreement between the Social Action Fund (SAF), the Water Department, and&#13;
the contractor, and (ii) for proposals which are independent of the SAF and thus have been&#13;
transmitted direct to the Water Department, a normal two-party contract between the Water&#13;
Department and the contractor. The contracts will oblige the SAF and Water Department to&#13;
ensure that the contractor is provided with the opportunity to construct say 250 installations&#13;
within a specified time. The contractor will be obliged to construct and provide the facilities&#13;
and training to a village within a maximum number of weeks of being requested, and to do so&#13;
in accordance with the standards specified. The SAF (for case (i) above), or the Water&#13;
Department (for case (ii)), will be obliged to pay the contractor when it receives a satisfactory&#13;
certificate of completion. The contract will give community Water Committees the option of&#13;
negotiating extras with the contractor or others (and to pay accordingly) if they wish.&#13;
4.     Mobilization and Initiation. Communities are advised at a very early stage of the&#13;
preconditions a community must satisfy if any proposal it wishes to put for the provision of&#13;
village scale water infrastructure is to be eligible for further consideration. The preconditions&#13;
will include:&#13;
(a)    the community must form a Water Committee, and elect or appoint a President&#13;
and Secretary;&#13;
(b)    it must agree to establish a maintenance fund, to carrying out all the&#13;
maintenance that may be necessary or expedient to maintain the water facility&#13;
in operating condition and to ensure that funds earmarked for maintenance are&#13;
used for no other purpose; and&#13;
(c)    implementation of a water supply facility may not commence until the Water&#13;
Committee has deposited in its maintenance fund sufficient to ensure that all&#13;
maintenance required over the ensuing 12 months can be undertaken.&#13;
5.    Villaae Water Committee prares and submits prpsal. The community, led by its&#13;
Water Committee and with other support if it wishes, decides what facilities it will seek.. This&#13;
may involve any of a number of sectors.  If water supply facilities are a part of what the&#13;
community seeks, the information on the process and prerequisites for eligibility will advise&#13;
that it should seek the advice of the Water Department, although it may seek advice from any&#13;
other source. Information on availability of water, (both surface and underground) for the&#13;
locality will be provided to the extent that this is known. The village submits its proposal to the&#13;
SAF (case(i)), or the Water Department (case (ii)).&#13;
6.     Appraisal and deceinn. The SAF or the Water Departrnent ensure that an office&#13;
technical evaluation and a field appraisal are done. The Water Department will try to determine&#13;
whether or not water will be available in adequate quantity and quality, and whether local water&#13;
&#13;

resources will be overtaxed. It will provide advice to the village on the sites that will give best&#13;
results in terns of water yield, quality and drainage. It will provide a cost estimate, using&#13;
established contractor rates, or other sources of cost information if the proposal is not fully&#13;
within the scope of the 'rates' contracts. The appraisal will involve all concerned sectors, for&#13;
example health, education and irrigation if the proposal involves those components. If the&#13;
proposal is appraised as acceptable, the SAF or if appropriate the Water Department notifies&#13;
the Water Committee, the contractor and where appropriate the Water Department.&#13;
7.    Implecmaein.   The contractor notifies the Water Committee and the Water&#13;
Department the date he will begin work on the site. The Water Committee, the Water&#13;
Department and the contractor will provide the SAF with a certificate of completion, checking&#13;
off all items required, including standard of work, and advising the amount payable. The SAF&#13;
pays the contractor.&#13;
8.     Transitin. The National Water Development Program (NWDP) will incorporate a&#13;
small investment the provision of new borehole supplies at village scale. It may be necessary&#13;
to employ existing drilling skills in the Water Department by pernitting its drilling units to&#13;
respond to the tender call and allocating it some work on a limited period basis, using separate&#13;
profit center accounting, in a move to commercialize and ultimately downsize or privatize this&#13;
aspect of the Water Department's operations. The contributions of the staff and facilities of the&#13;
Water Department to SAF activities will be provided from  SAF funds, as unlike other&#13;
Departments where all staff salaries are funded from the government's recurrent account, this&#13;
expenditure is (appropriately) charged to the cost of the capital projects on which they are&#13;
employed. This will be arranged as part of the three way contracts between the Water&#13;
Department, the SAP, and the contractors.&#13;

2.    In addition to field supervision as specified below, IDA staff would spend an estimated&#13;
4 staff-weeks per annum at headquarters during the early implementation years reviewing and&#13;
commenting on procurement documents and disbursement requests, and a further 3 staff-weeks&#13;
per annum over the course of project execution for reviewing reports and audited accounts and&#13;
for IDA support for project implementation.&#13;
3.    A mid-term review of GOM and IDA would be undertaken in September 1997. The&#13;
TOR would be prepared by IDA and agreed with GOM prior to the review date. The review&#13;
will assess physical, institutional and financial progress of the two-year program as measured&#13;
against targets to be agreed at negotiations. Based on the reviews, the program will be adjusted&#13;
to be consistent with the targets as revised according to experience gained by the time of the&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;

NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Forecast Financial Performance of RWBs and LWB&#13;
Financial forecasts for the three regional water boards&#13;
1.           The financial forecasts for fiscal years 1995/1996 to 2010/2011 and the assumptions on which&#13;
they are based are shown in the pages which follow.&#13;
2.            Assum=tions. The forecasts are prepared in constant March 1995 prices in Malawi Kwacha.&#13;
The figures used are derived from December 1993 figures corrected for inflation and exchange rate change&#13;
during the interim period up to March 1995. The opening balance sheet for each board is assumed to be a&#13;
proportion of DWSF's existing balance sheet based on the ratio of the value of fixed assets corresponding to&#13;
each region.&#13;
3.            Population. The forecasts assume a base population served by the urban water systems in each&#13;
region of equal to that currently being served by DWSF in that region. Population growth is then assumed at&#13;
6. 1 % being the 1977-87 intercensal rates. The coverage rates used in the forecast are taken from the&#13;
consultants report'. Average consumption in liters per capita per day is assumed at 90 for piped water and 27&#13;
for water kiosk supply.&#13;
4.            uariff. Opening tariffs are set at March 1995 levels and increased so as to meet the cost&#13;
coverage targets defined in conditionality (paragraph 4.8).&#13;
5.            Collections. The forecasts assume that 90% of the value of water sold is successfully collected&#13;
as income.&#13;
6.            Fixed Assets. Opening values for fixed assets are taken from the Asset Valuation study&#13;
recently completed for DWSF2. Sewerage asset values are taken from the consultant's report'. Capital&#13;
expenditure for the subsequent years reflects the investment profile prepared as part of the National Water&#13;
Sector Development Project except for the investment in Zomba Damn for which the investment is considered to&#13;
be in proportion to the urban consumers to be served, i.e. 35% of the total investment cost. Depreciation is&#13;
calculated on the basis of 3.3% of net book value each year.&#13;
7.            Eina-ncing. Where possible internal financing of investments is encouraged. Where external&#13;
financing is required this is assumed to come direct from Government in a mixture of equity (grant) and debt&#13;
funding such that the debt to equity ratio is not worse than 60:40. Loans are repaid assuming a 20 year term&#13;
and five years grace.&#13;

Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 2 of 19&#13;
8.           lnventories. Stock levels are assumed to reflect 7% of the operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
Operations and maintenance costs are assumed at an average cost per capita served per year as specified in the&#13;
consultants report'. After discussion with the MOW and the WD, a 10% cost saving after the establishment of&#13;
the new Boards has been assumed.&#13;
9.            Salaries. Salaries reflect a reduction in the current overstaffing in the water department and an&#13;
increase in the average salary paid as the staff move from Government to parastatal employ-ment. Amounts of&#13;
salary costs for each region are set out in the consultant's report'. Again, a 10% cost saving has been assumed&#13;
after the establishment of the new Boards.&#13;
10.           Admini1tr2tioln. Cost of administration is set at 10% of operations, maintenance and salary&#13;
costs.&#13;
Financial forecasts for Liongwe Water Board&#13;
I1.          The forecasts presented for LWB are based on the samne assumptions as listed above for the&#13;
regional water boards, except for the opening balance sheet and capital investment which are taken from the&#13;
LWB corporate plan. Capital investment has been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of the Third Lilongwe Water&#13;
Supply project.&#13;
Key indicators for Blantyre Water Board&#13;
12.           Key indicators are presented for Blantyre Water Board by way of comparison. No investment&#13;
in BWB is assumed within this project. The assumptions used to calculate these indicators are the same as for&#13;
the RWB's except for the opening balance sheet and the capital investmnent which are taken from the&#13;
consultant's report'&#13;

NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Summary&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
Zomba - Upper Mulunguzi Dam&#13;
I.    Introduction. An environmental study, entitled EIA Zomba Upper Mulunguzi Dam, was&#13;
undertaken from November 1989 to November 1990. A report and extensive Executive&#13;
Summary were provided by the consultants, Lahmeyer International Consulting Engineers, and&#13;
are held in the Project Files. This Annex summarizes this information.&#13;
2.    Initial results from technical studies. Raw water for the city of Zomba is drawn from the&#13;
Mulunguzi River on the Zomba Plateau. The yield from the existing dam and reservoir,&#13;
constructed in 1950, has not been adequate to meet demand for some years, and is far short of&#13;
projected future needs. Based on the results of feasibility studies, a staged development was&#13;
indicated. This consisted first of a new dam at an upper site not far below the river's head, and,&#13;
later, a higher dam downstream of the existing dam, which would inundate the existing structure&#13;
in a new and larger reservoir. The feasibility studies, which included three alternative dam sites&#13;
and four alternative operational schemes, found that this staged approach, incorporating the dam&#13;
at the upper site as the first stage, would cost much less than any of the other alternatives&#13;
considered.&#13;
3.    The Upper Mulunguzi Marsh. The new reservoir proposed at the upper site would cover&#13;
about 85% of the Upper Mulunguzi Marsh, a flat marshy, grassy depression. The Marsh covers&#13;
an area of about 26.5 hectares, at altitudes from 1,721 m.a.s.l. in the center to 1740 m.a.s.l. at the&#13;
edges, surrounded by an area of fringe natural forest and shrub of 13.9 hectares. The marsh&#13;
consists of a thick layer of organic material covered by a floating carpet of grass vegetation. It is&#13;
of great ecological importance as a natural reservoir which minimizes discharge variations in the&#13;
upper course of the Mulunguzi River, and is a habitat for a diverse vegetation, not particularly&#13;
rich in species, but with a very high percentage (over 40%) of rare species, as well as a number&#13;
of species not yet found elsewhere in Malawi. The invertebrate fauna is different and in many&#13;
instances distinct from other marshy locations on the Zomba Plateau, and may be a unique&#13;
biotope in Malawi and neighboring countries.&#13;
4.    Effects of impoundment. The marsh in its present state ( i.e. its biotic conditions and&#13;
characteristic plant communities) will die as a result of impoundment, with loss of its existing&#13;
biota, including the populations of species that are rare and possibly unique. The areas that&#13;
would not be inundated are in fact connected hydraulically to the large area that would be, and&#13;
the existing biota of these areas would be lost also. Under the characteristic marsh nitrogen/&#13;
phosphorous/ oxygen regime, a large organic load has been preserved in the marsh area. It is&#13;
highly likely that this will be released on impoundment, resulting in a subsequent eutrophication&#13;
of the reservoir. The oxygen balance, both in the reservoir and in the river downstream, will&#13;
remain negative for an extended period as a result of the decomposition processes, with changes&#13;
in oxygen content that may be lethal for higher animals such as fish and Crustacea. Both the&#13;
nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations will increase substantially. The band of evergreen&#13;
&#13;

forest lining the banks of the Mulunguzi River is a result of long-tenn interactions of several&#13;
ecological and environmental factors and processes dependent on the availability of abundant&#13;
moisture both in soil and air. Several species will not be able to adapt to the altered conditions,&#13;
and will be competed out or otherwise eliminated.&#13;
5.   BRcmmendations, It is recommended to erect a new dam downstream of the existing&#13;
dam able to provide sufficient water for Zomba City and the rural areas. This new location&#13;
implies the following advantages:&#13;
*  The water quality will not be effected.&#13;
* The population of Zomba City and the rural area will not experience water shortages.&#13;
*  The Upper Mulunguzi Marsh will not be destroyed.&#13;
*  The water flow in the 7 km long river bed on the Zomba Plateau will not be changed.&#13;
* No additional investigation for the environmental aspects will be required. For&#13;
necessary future statements in the Design Report for the lower dam site, all field data&#13;
and criteria are already available.&#13;
*  There are no restrictions expected from the ecological and environmental point of&#13;
view for the construction of the dam at the lower site.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The National Water Development Project
            will support the implementation of the Government of Malawi
            Water Resources Management Policy and Strategies by
            reforming and upgrading the management of water resources
            and the provision of water related services to: (a) ensure
            convenient access to safe water for domestic use, for a
            progressively larger proportion of the community; (b)
            provide water infrastructure capable of underpinning
            economic development; and (c) assure the protection and
            management of water resources and of aquatic and riparian
            environments. Improve sector sustainability and upgraded
            physical and financial performance are subordinate
            objectives vital to the attainment of the primary objective
            and will be achieved, within the project, through: (a)
            institutional restructuring; (b) the development and
            utilization of both the public and private sectors; (c)
            active involvement of stakeholders; (d) implementation of a
            policy framework and strategies guiding new investment in
            the sector, water resources allocation, pricing and cost
            recovery; and (e) implementation of a coherent program of
            investment in rehabilitation and in new services consistent
            with these principles, and managed by the restructured
            sector institutions.
