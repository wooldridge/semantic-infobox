Abstract: The Pacific island countries (PICs) are some of the most exposed to frequent natural&#13;
disasters and climate shocks, and their vulnerability is increasing due to mounting effects of&#13;
climate change as well as demographic and economic forces. Natural disasters hit the poorest&#13;
hardest and have long-term consequences for human development. Social protection&#13;
programs and systems have an important role in helping poor and vulnerable populations&#13;
cope with the impacts of shocks as well as build long-term resilience. This paper discusses the&#13;
potential role of social protection for disaster and climate risk reduction and management in&#13;
PICs. It presents evidence and lessons from other regions, providing examples of tools and&#13;
entry points for the development of climate- and disaster- responsive social protection&#13;
interventions and context-specific recommendations for PICs.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                    Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
The Pacific island countries (PICs) are some of the most exposed to frequent natural&#13;
disasters and climate shocks, and their vulnerability is increasing due to mounting effects of&#13;
climate change as well as demographic and economic forces (World Bank, 2012a). These&#13;
shocks result in high economic and social costs for the region and represent a threat to&#13;
development and poverty reduction. In the past 60 years, PICs have experienced losses due&#13;
to natural disasters and climate shocks averaging US$ 284 million a year, and affecting, in&#13;
total, over 9 million people and causing 9,811 reported deaths. In Samoa, 2011 cyclone Evan&#13;
caused an estimated infrastructure and production loss of US$ 204 million, which represents&#13;
28 percent of the value of all goods and services produced in the country that year&#13;
(Government of Samoa, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Natural disasters and climate shocks often hit the poorest and vulnerable harder and sink&#13;
them deeper into poverty. Natural disasters cause economic damage, death and injuries, but&#13;
also other, less evident, losses, such as illness, missed school and work days, loss of&#13;
subsistence crops, etc. (World Bank, 2012a). These impacts can become permanent and have&#13;
long-term consequences for human development, with families pulling children out of school,&#13;
reducing health clinic visits, etc. (World Bank, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
The poor and those who experience chronic hardship are often more exposed to natural&#13;
hazards because their livelihoods and, often, their locations are highly sensitive to shocks,&#13;
and they often have little access to information, lack savings and depend on informal safety&#13;
nets that are unable to function after major covariate shocks. Thus, when disaster hits, those&#13;
that already vulnerable are usually the most affected. In addition, people who are at risk of&#13;
falling into poverty and hardship â&#128;&#147; people just above poverty line and vulnerable populations&#13;
â&#128;&#147; can be pushed into transient poverty when a disaster hits as their livelihoods become&#13;
destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
It is expected that natural disasters will become more frequent and unpredictable in the&#13;
region as the effects of climate change intensify. Their impacts may worsen as they combine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                2&#13;
&amp;#12;with other forces such as rapid, unplanned urbanization, poor natural resource management&#13;
and the erosion of traditional social networks that drive up exposure of great numbers of&#13;
population. Without appropriate policies and initiatives in place, the impacts of climate&#13;
change are likely to be significant and pervasive and fall disproportionately on the poor&#13;
(World Bank, 2012a).&#13;
&#13;
Social protection programs and systems have an important role in helping poor and&#13;
vulnerable populations cope with the impacts of shocks and build long-term resilience.&#13;
From providing timely, opportune safety net interventions in time of crises to offering long-&#13;
term tools for increasing assets, skills and livelihoods, social protection has a role in the&#13;
management of risk for poor people. In the context of high climate and disaster risk, which&#13;
the Pacific region is subject to, it becomes even more critical to think of ways social protection&#13;
interventions can address these risks.&#13;
&#13;
This paper discusses the potential role of social protection for disaster and climate risk&#13;
reduction and management in the PICs and intends to serve as a primer for World Bank&#13;
engagement in social protection in the region. The study presents evidence and lessons from&#13;
other countries and regions with the goal of providing examples of tools and entry points for&#13;
the development of climate- and disaster- responsive social protection interventions.&#13;
However, given the Pacific region specific context and the characteristics of each countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
social protection (SP), climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk management (DRM)&#13;
sector, it is important to keep in mind that some of these lessons will need to be extrapolated&#13;
to other settings with due caution.&#13;
&#13;
The reference to PICs in this paper embraces the ten World Bank member countries in the&#13;
Pacific: Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Palau, Samoa, Solomon&#13;
Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Although not considered part of Pacific Islands, Papua&#13;
New Guinea and Timor-Leste are also included here as important players in the region. In&#13;
total, these countries have a population of over 10 million people (with PNG accounting for 7&#13;
million) spread across hundreds of islands in the area equivalent to 15 percent of the globeâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
surface.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;Pacific island countries (PICs) experience a dangerous combination of high exposure to&#13;
natural hazards and high vulnerability that makes them particularly prone to disaster risk.&#13;
According to the 2012 World Risk Report (BÃ¼ndnis, Entwicklung, Hilft, 2012) which measures&#13;
disaster risk based on hazard exposure, susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of&#13;
adaptive capacities, six out of the 15 countries most at risk to disasters in the world are Pacific&#13;
island countries2, with Vanuatu and Tonga in first and second place, respectively. In terms of&#13;
exposure, some of the most common hazards are tropical cyclones, earthquakes and&#13;
tsunamis. Moreover, there is strong evidence in the region of an increase in the observed&#13;
frequency and intensity of weather and climate-related events, and the climate also appears&#13;
to be changing (World Bank, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
PICs also have a set of economic and social characteristics that make them vulnerable to&#13;
disasters, including: (i) small economies, with very limited natural resources and reliance on&#13;
coastal areas, which are extremely fragile and vulnerable to change; (ii) high dependence on&#13;
the rural economy and agriculture, which are very sensitive to climate shocks; (iii)&#13;
dependence on global markets (open economies importing foodstuff and essential items, and&#13;
exporting agricultural products and tourism), which makes them highly exposed to global&#13;
economic shocks; (iv) rapid unplanned urbanization (often driven by outer-to-main island&#13;
migration), which gives rise to poor housing or slums lacking the services provided by local&#13;
and central government and being at high exposure to shocks.&#13;
&#13;
The economic and social losses caused by natural disasters and climate shocks, their&#13;
relationship with poverty and the increasing nature of these threats all point out to the&#13;
need of protecting the poor, but also helping them reduce their exposure and increase their&#13;
capacity to deal with and recover from those impacts. Social protection interventions have&#13;
been recognized as an important instrument in this task. In several countries, experience has&#13;
shown that when a disaster hits, the provision or temporary expansion of social protection&#13;
mechanisms such as cash and asset transfers, subsidies, emergency public works, etc., can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
    This list includes Timor-Leste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;help the affected and vulnerable populations cope with the effect of disasters. Social&#13;
protection programs can also help increase opportunities, by promoting human capital&#13;
development, access to sustainable livelihoods, and employment. In this way, they can&#13;
contribute to long-term resilience and climate change adaptation.&#13;
&#13;
For the positive links between social protection systems, disaster risk management and&#13;
climate change to materialize, social protection programs ideally need to be in place before&#13;
disasters hit, and need to be endowed with sound design and effective implementation and&#13;
coordination mechanisms. By being prepared in advance, social protection systems might be&#13;
able to respond to natural disasters and climate-related shocks more effectively and help&#13;
decrease the impacts of the shock on the most vulnerable. As traditional practices lose&#13;
effectiveness, the need for formal and contextualized risk management and adaptation&#13;
measures becomes more pressing.&#13;
&#13;
Although formal social protection systems are in their infancy in the Pacific, there is a&#13;
growing recognition that traditional and informal safety net mechanisms in PICs are not&#13;
sufficient to respond to the challenges of covariate shocks (World Bank, 2014). For this&#13;
reason, it becomes important to not only incorporate disaster risk reduction and climate&#13;
change adaptation objectives into existing social protection programs, but also develop new&#13;
programs aimed at addressing these risks. This paper examines the core set of SP/DRM/CCA&#13;
issues across PICs, and offers recommendations and entry points to move this agenda&#13;
forward.&#13;
&#13;
The institutional frameworks of SP, DRM and CCA systems have some common&#13;
characteristics across all PICs, and are faced with several challenges. Traditionally, most of&#13;
the focus in the region seems to have been placed on more reactive disaster response,&#13;
providing short-term relief based on in-kind commodities such as food, relief kits, shelter, etc.&#13;
Some of these activities have sometimes been followed by recovery efforts, such as housing&#13;
reconstruction, small shelter solutions, etc. In general, PICs have limited financial and&#13;
institutional capacity for large-scale disaster response, and thus rely on international donors&#13;
for relief after major disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;There are also some other key constraints which impede increasing the effectiveness in&#13;
these sectors, including: (i) DRM and CCA frameworks are not fully incorporated into national&#13;
budgets, sectors and programs; (ii) often, the DRM and CCA teams/departments/ministries&#13;
are separate entities with their own agendas; (iii) limited human resources and institutional&#13;
capacity at the national level for disaster response, which relies on very few people with&#13;
limited resources; (iv) limited data availability and weak hazard and climate monitoring and&#13;
information management systems; (v) a top-down approach and limited community&#13;
involvement in formal risk reduction activities.&#13;
&#13;
Although a few countries in the region already have some formal social protection&#13;
programs in place, these programs tend to be small in comparison with those in many other&#13;
countries. The predominant form of social protection seems to be social insurance programs&#13;
for formal workers and the elderly, which, given the existing levels of informality, means that&#13;
most social insurance programs reach only a small proportion of the population. The most&#13;
common types of non-contributory social protection are universal pensions and relatively&#13;
small cash transfers schemes. Many PICs provide free basic education and health services to&#13;
the general population. A few governments, with the support from donors, have established&#13;
one-off public works programs, although often their goal has been to build infrastructure,&#13;
with the employment objective as a secondary consideration (AusAID, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
There are very few experiences using formal social protection mechanisms for disaster&#13;
response or risk reduction in PICs, and they seem to have been reactive and small-scale. As&#13;
the PICs expand and reform their social protection systems, it is crucial that disaster and&#13;
climate risks are taken into account given the regionâ&#128;&#153;s exposure and vulnerability to these&#13;
shocks. A climate and disaster responsive social protection system would need to take into&#13;
account the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
Climate- and Disaster-aware Planning, which implies building the necessary contingency and&#13;
information mechanisms (e.g. early warning systems, risk mapping) and climate- and disaster-&#13;
sensitive targeting into the intervention. Traditionally, targeting of formal social protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;interventions in the Pacific Island countries has been limited given low capacity and scarce&#13;
data, with a few exceptions (e.g., the targeted Poverty Benefit Scheme in Fiji).&#13;
&#13;
Interventions Centered on Livelihoods and Assets, with the goal of strengthening social,&#13;
physical and natural community assets in a way that increases resilience to shocks and&#13;
supports viable livelihoods for households. There is also a need to develop a knowledge base&#13;
about what can work in urban areas to support and enhance social protection as a platform&#13;
for CCA and DRM agendas.&#13;
&#13;
Building Adaptive and Response Capacity at System Level to deal with large systemic shocks,&#13;
which will require developing: (i) appropriate institutional capacity and coordination with&#13;
DRM and climate change agencies to tap into combined expertise and institutional capacity;&#13;
and, (ii) scalable and flexible mechanisms that can quickly react to protect populations during&#13;
or after a disaster (e.g. targeting, registry, and payment systems). Moving forward on this&#13;
agenda in PICs might first require the development of country-specific diagnostics and&#13;
assessments to identify entry points.&#13;
&#13;
In spite of these general principles, the choice of an appropriate social protection&#13;
instrument is always highly contextual, and must be based on a careful assessment of the&#13;
objectives that are to be achieved by the intervention, as well as the capacity and resources&#13;
for implementation. Some of the key SP instruments and related factors for consideration&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
In-kind vs. cash benefits: Although many agencies that have traditionally used in-kind&#13;
assistance are now more widely promoting the use of cash-based interventions, food aid&#13;
continues to be the key in many contexts, for instance, when markets are disrupted, are not&#13;
developed or when there is no cash-based local economy, such as is the case in many remote&#13;
island locations in the Pacific. Cash transfers, on the other hand, are versatile instruments&#13;
that can be used to meet a range of needs. In PICs, it appears that immediate disaster&#13;
response tends to be mostly in-kind as formal cash transfer mechanisms are very limited, and&#13;
have seldom been used for responding to natural disasters, largely due to the cultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;aversion to cash transfers in many PICs (e.g., Vanuatu, Samoa). However, as these countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
economies quickly monetize, options for accessing cash become important in the wake of&#13;
disasters.&#13;
&#13;
Conditional or Unconditional Cash Transfers: In general, the use of cash transfers after&#13;
emergencies has been limited to unconditional transfers, since conditions might be too&#13;
onerous for affected families immediately after a disaster, due to disruptions in services, etc.&#13;
Although the experience with either conditional or unconditional cash transfers in the Pacific&#13;
Island countries is limited, demand for these types of interventions might increase together&#13;
with a higher degree of monetization.&#13;
&#13;
Public Works Programs: In addition to reaching individual households in need, public works&#13;
programs (PWPs) also bring additional tangible and immediate benefits to the community by&#13;
helping build or rehabilitate infrastructure, assets, or natural resources that are much needed&#13;
in the aftermath of disasters. Before a disaster occurs, ex-ante public works can focus on&#13;
activities with risk reduction and adaptation benefits (e.g. environmental conservation and&#13;
rehabilitation works, soil and water management, etc.). In PICs, there is tremendous potential&#13;
to use PWPs as a mechanism to provide cash transfers and employment to poor and&#13;
vulnerable populations, while at the same time helping build or rehabilitate infrastructure,&#13;
assets and resources that help communities increase their resilience. Public works could also&#13;
be used as an instrument to support urban development agenda. Focusing public works on&#13;
young adults in the Pacific would be particularly valuable given the large numbers of&#13;
unemployed youth. Disaster resilience elements could be potentially integrated into existing&#13;
PWPs, such as Rapid Employment Project (REP) in Solomon Islands and the Urban Youth&#13;
Employment Project (UYEP) in PNG.&#13;
&#13;
Index-based insurance: In general, index-based micro insurance focuses on insuring livestock&#13;
or crop losses by small farmers. SP programs can provide an effective and, likely, cost-efficient&#13;
means of making disaster insurance accessible to the chronically poor. The security provided&#13;
by the insurance, combined with regular cash transfers and/or other forms of asset&#13;
protection against climate-related impacts, may further create an enabling environment for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;prudent risk-taking by poor households to increase and diversify their asset/income base. At&#13;
the sovereign level, several PICs already share climate/disaster risk through the Pacific&#13;
Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment&#13;
and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), with Tonga being the first country to receive a payout in&#13;
January 2014 following Cyclone Ian.&#13;
&#13;
In conclusion, although each PICâ&#128;&#153;s social, economic and cultural context is unique and varies&#13;
substantially from country to country, they all face some similar challenges as they become&#13;
more integrated in the global economy, but also more exposed to forces that modify their&#13;
traditional societies. PICsâ&#128;&#153; high exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and climate&#13;
change compounds these problems. These vulnerabilities not only point to the need for more&#13;
comprehensive formal social protection systems, but also make it essential that, as SP&#13;
systems start to emerge and evolve, they include disaster and climate risk considerations, in&#13;
order to provide prevention, protection and promotion functions around these risks.&#13;

&amp;#12;   I. Motivation and Context&#13;
           a. Introduction&#13;
As natural disasters and climate shocks become increasingly important threats to economic&#13;
growth and development, it is essential to find ways to systematically protect and build&#13;
resilience of vulnerable and poor populations. Social protection can play a key role, as it aims&#13;
to help those in need cope with the impacts of shocks and build their long-term resilience. In&#13;
general, social protection programs have been used as a vehicle to respond to economic and&#13;
financial crises, and, recently, have expanded quickly across the developing world. For&#13;
instance, in 2008, safety nets interventions were increased exponentially to address the&#13;
effects of the triple food, fuel, and financial crises (Marzo and Mori, 2012). Although the use&#13;
of social protection interventions for disaster and climate risk management has not been&#13;
systematic, they are increasingly seen as a potential mechanism to help individuals cope with&#13;
shocks arising from natural hazards, helping them reduce risk ex-ante and offering protection&#13;
when disasters hit. In the context of high climate and disaster risk, as well as high poverty and&#13;
vulnerability, such as that experienced in Pacific island countries (PICs), social protection&#13;
interventions can become an important mechanism to address these risks.&#13;
This paper explores the potential of SP interventions as a mechanism for disaster response&#13;
and long-term resilience in the Pacific island countries.&#13;
It offers a preliminary review of the potential role social protection interventions can play in&#13;
disaster and climate risk management in the Pacific Islands and intends to serve as a primer&#13;
for World Bank engagement in the region. This study recognizes that social protection is a&#13;
nascent sector in the region and that programs, systems, and institutions are, in many cases,&#13;
being just established or developed. The paper presents evidence and lessons from other&#13;
regions with the goal of providing options and entry points for the development of climate&#13;
and disaster responsive social protection interventions and systems in PICs. However, given&#13;
the regionâ&#128;&#153;s peculiarities , it is important to keep in mind that some of these lessons need to&#13;
be extrapolated carefully and interventions that aim to address the social impacts of climate&#13;
change and disasters must be developed with particular regard to each countryâ&#128;&#153;s context and&#13;
through an iterative and collaborative process with relevant national and local stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;In spite of these important caveats, experiences from other regions can offer lessons, tools&#13;
and options that kick-start the dialogue around climate and disaster responsive social&#13;
protection in the PICs. As peopleâ&#128;&#153;s food security, livelihoods, and well-being continue to be&#13;
threatened by natural hazards, it is necessary to think of comprehensive interventions that&#13;
focus not only on the physical impacts of disasters but also on their social implications. Social&#13;
protection interventions offer a way to tackle the risk and effects these shocks have on the&#13;
poor and destitute.&#13;
           b. Motivation: Why integrate DRM and CCA with SP?&#13;
Natural disasters and climate-related shocks have important consequences for economic&#13;
growth, prosperity and development.&#13;

Natural disasters and climate shocks have high economic and social costs and represent a&#13;
threat to development and poverty reduction. Globally, over the past 30 years, disasters have&#13;
caused an estimated US$ 3.5 trillion in losses, with 2011 - the costliest year on record -&#13;
estimated at US$ 380 billion (World Bank, 2012b). In the past 60 years, PICs have experienced&#13;
losses due to natural disasters and climate shocks averaging US$ 284 million a year. Since&#13;
1950, natural disasters have affected approximately 9.2 million people in the Pacific region,&#13;
causing 9,811 reported deaths (World Bank, 2009b).&#13;
For smaller countries, disasters are often more costly - they can represent a significant&#13;
portion of GDP - while often affecting the poor and vulnerable disproportionately. In Samoa,&#13;
2011 cyclone Evan caused an estimated infrastructure and production loss of US$204 million,&#13;
which represents 28 percent of the value of all goods and services produced in the country&#13;
that year (Government of Samoa, 2013). The 2004 floods in Navua, Fiji resulted in an average&#13;
loss to farming households of FJ$ 4,815 per household compared to an average household&#13;
income of FJ$ 3,500 a year. In this region, 60 percent of the population is dependent on&#13;
primary industries (agriculture, forestry, and fishing) that are highly vulnerable to disasters&#13;
(SOPAC, 2009).&#13;
Natural disasters cause deaths and injuries, but also other, less evident, losses, such as illness,&#13;
missed school and work days, loss of subsistence crops, and opportunity costs (World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                11&#13;
&amp;#12;2012a). These impacts, which are seldom documented, can sometimes become permanent&#13;
and have long-term consequences for human development, with families pulling children out&#13;
of school, decreased health clinic visits, stunting and even decreased cognitive abilities&#13;
(World Bank, 2010). In a cross-country study, Cuaresma (2009) measures secondary school&#13;
enrolment as a proxy for human capital accumulation and finds that those more exposed to&#13;
earthquakes between 1980 and 2000 have lower secondary school enrollment rates that&#13;
those with lower exposure.&#13;
PICs are some of the most exposed to frequent natural hazards, and their vulnerability is&#13;
increasing due to the mounting effects of climate change as well as demographic and&#13;
economic forces (World Bank, 2012a). Of the 20 countries with the highest average annual&#13;
disaster losses relative to GDP, eight are PICs (World Bank, 2012a). Each of these countries&#13;
face threats that might cause them severe human, economic, physical and environmental&#13;
losses, and some are facing risks of economic loss that would represent over half of their GDP.&#13;
For instance, cyclone modeling in the region shows that in the capital cities of Fiji, Solomon&#13;
Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga, a cyclone with a 100-year recurrence interval â&#128;&#148; which&#13;
has a 50 percent chance of occurring within the current generation â&#128;&#148; could inflict damage&#13;
equivalent to 60 percent of GDP (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
                   ii. The costs of disasters fall disproportionately on the poor and create&#13;
                      more poverty&#13;
Disasters and climate change threaten economic growth and poverty reduction, causing loss&#13;
of life, as well as destroying livelihoods and infrastructure. These impacts often&#13;
disproportionately affect the poor and most vulnerable. However, natural disasters and&#13;
climate shocks not only hit the poorest and vulnerable harder, but they also induce and&#13;
exacerbate poverty.&#13;
The 2014 World Development Report on Risk and Opportunity (World Bank, 2013b) suggests&#13;
that a strong risk management strategy would include four components, interacting and&#13;
reinforcing each other: accessing knowledge, building protection, obtaining insurance (in the&#13;
broader sense) and, once the event has occurred, using all three tools for actually coping with&#13;
the shock. The poor and vulnerable are at a disadvantage on all these fronts. The poor are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;often more exposed to, or less protected from, natural hazards because their livelihoods and&#13;
assets are highly sensitive to shocks. They are also more vulnerable to these hazards due to&#13;
a lack of timely information, lack of access to financial instruments such as savings, credit and&#13;
insurance, and dependence on informal safety nets that often break down after major&#13;
covariate shocks. Thus, when disaster hits, they are usually the most affected as they have&#13;
little capacity to anticipate, cope and recover from the impacts. In Fiji, a national level analysis&#13;
of the relationship between poverty and disasters found that the level of poverty negatively&#13;
affects the impacts of the disaster (SOPAC, 2009). The UNâ&#128;&#153;s Rapid Environmental Assessment&#13;
of the impact of the December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean noted that,&#13;
disproportionately, many of the victims of this disaster were poor people who depended on&#13;
eco-system services and natural resources for their livelihoods (IRIN, 2005).&#13;
Additionally, people who are at risk of falling into poverty and hardship â&#128;&#147; people just above&#13;
poverty line and vulnerable populations (children, women, elderly) â&#128;&#147; can be pushed into&#13;
transient poverty when a disaster hits as their livelihoods become destroyed. Although results&#13;
might be context-specific, a study on the links between poverty and disasters (Shepherd et&#13;
al., 2013) found that in areas of Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India where drought is a&#13;
major risk, this type of shock is also the single most important factor in impoverishment â&#128;&#147;&#13;
outstripping, for example, ill health or dowry payments. The study also shows that disaster-&#13;
related impoverishment appears to have a distinct within-country geography, being largely&#13;
rural rather than urban.&#13;
Finally, poverty also increases disaster risks by intensifying the over-utilization of resources -&#13;
for instance, cutting trees for firewood, thus increasing erosion and risk of flooding.&#13;
&#13;
As both the chronic and transient poor are faced with more frequent disasters and climate&#13;
shocks (for instance, low-intensity, high-probability shocks such as frequent storms, floods,&#13;
or droughts), they have even less chances to rebuild their livelihoods and invest in human&#13;
capital, thus becoming trapped in a cycle that sinks them further down into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
                   iii. Natural disasters will become more variable and unpredictable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;Globally, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and unpredictable as the effects of&#13;
climate change intensify and combine with other forces such as rapid, unplanned&#13;
urbanization, poor natural resource management and the erosion of traditional social&#13;
networks that increases the exposure of the population at large. In the Pacific, the climate is&#13;
already changing and the rate of change is likely to intensify in the future (World Bank,&#13;
2012a). Without appropriate policies and initiatives in place, the impacts of climate change&#13;
are likely to be significant and pervasive and fall disproportionately on the poor (World Bank,&#13;
2012a).&#13;
PICs are highly exposed to natural hazards and climate change and the effects will be most&#13;
dire for the poor and vulnerable. Although social protection systems are in their infancy in&#13;
PICs, there is growing recognition that traditional and informal mechanisms are not sufficient&#13;
to respond to the challenges of big covariate shocks. Social protection policies and programs&#13;
must then carefully consider addressing disaster risk reduction and climate change&#13;
adaptation as part of their objectives.&#13;
&#13;
           c. How can social protection systems address climate and disaster challenges?&#13;
The economic and social losses caused by natural disasters and climate shocks, their&#13;
relationship with poverty and the increasing nature of these threats all point out to the need&#13;
for protecting the poor, help reduce their exposure and increase their capacity to deal with&#13;
these shocks as key to development. Social protection interventions are an important&#13;
instrument and experience from around the world have shown that when a disaster hits,&#13;
having in place or establishing social protection interventions can help speed up recovery and&#13;
prevent people from falling into poverty. As noted by an IEG assessment (2006), â&#128;&#156;getting cash&#13;
support to victims quickly has positively affected peopleâ&#128;&#153;s sense of safety and security [and]&#13;
has been a prominent first sign of government supportâ&#128;&#157; (See Box 1).&#13;
  Box 1: Pakistan Citizen Damage Compensation Program&#13;
  In July and August 2010, during the monsoon season, Pakistan experienced the worst&#13;
  floods in its history (IRIN, 2010). To respond to the floods, the Government put in place a&#13;
  temporary nationwide social safety net (SSN) program that successfully reached an&#13;
  estimated eight million flood-affected people. The program also led to the development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;  of a SSN disaster preparedness action plan by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) for future&#13;
  disasters and crises.&#13;
  The Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s Damage Compensation Program (CDCP) is a rapid response cash grant&#13;
  program. Phase I of this program ran from September 2010 to June 2011 with the goal to&#13;
  provide quick assistance to families who lost their homes or faced a serious threat to their&#13;
  wellbeing as a result of the flood. Eligible households located in the affected areas were&#13;
  given a one-off cash grant of PRK 20,000 (or approximately US$ 213). The funds helped&#13;
  households cover urgent needs at a crucial time (PDAM, 2011), as shown by an evaluation&#13;
  of Phase I, which found that families had used the grants mostly for food, health needs,&#13;
  housing repair, and debt re-payment (Hunt et al., 2011). However, the amount was&#13;
  insufficient for the flood-affected households to recapitalize their damaged or lost assets.&#13;
  Phase II of the CDCP started in 2011 with the goal to support the recovery of affected&#13;
  households. Flood-affected households, including many of those from Phase I, were&#13;
  provided with cash payments which could be used to meet any of their recovery needs,&#13;
  such as reconstructing their houses, restoring their livelihoods or paying back accumulated&#13;
  debt. With additional donor support available, the GOP was able to double the size of the&#13;
  grant to eligible households to PRK 40,000 (around US$ 426), a more suitable amount to&#13;
  support recovery.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In addition, evidence from around the world shows that social protection can not only help&#13;
protect the chronic poor from falling deeper into poverty after disasters, but also speed up&#13;
the recovery process for the transient poor by offering longer-term risk management&#13;
strategies. For instance, in Ethiopia, impact evaluations of the Productive Safety Nets&#13;
Program (PSNP) show that predictable, seasonal assistance from the program has enabled&#13;
households to manage risk more effectively and avoid adopting negative coping strategies&#13;
when hit by a shock (e.g. droughts), such as selling livelihood assets; and protect against food&#13;
insecurity (World Bank, 2013a) .&#13;
The World Bank Social Protection and Labor Strategy (World Bank, 2012c) recognizes three&#13;
risk management functions for Social Protection â&#128;&#148; prevention, protection and promotion â&#128;&#148;&#13;
and they all can play a role in disaster and climate risk management (see Figure 1).&#13;

                      i. Prevention&#13;
Social protection interventions can help prevent or reduce, ex-ante, the impacts of disasters&#13;
and climate-related shocks. By putting in place risk mitigation mechanisms and increasing the&#13;
availability of coping strategies for vulnerable populations before a disaster hits, social&#13;
protection interventions can help reduce their vulnerability.&#13;
Examples of these interventions are social or index-based insurance and public works to&#13;
conserve soil and water, or develop hazard-resistant infrastructure (see Box 2).&#13;
  Box 2: Reducing impacts of disaster through weather index insurance&#13;
  In Ethiopia, the Rural Resilience (R4/HARITA) Program gives poor farmers the option to pay&#13;
  for index-based insurance by working on small community projects that build climate&#13;
  resilience and agricultural productivity, such as improved irrigation or soil management.&#13;
  In the event of a seasonal drought, automatic insurance payouts to the farmers are&#13;
  triggered if rainfall drops below a predetermined threshold. This enables farmers to afford&#13;
&#13;

   having to sell off productive assets to survive.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                    ii.   Protection&#13;
Social protection contributes to equity by offering protection against destitution in the face&#13;
of disasters and climate-related shocks. Thus, these interventions can be used to help&#13;
affected and vulnerable populations cope with the effect of disasters and prevent them from&#13;
falling deeper into poverty through the provision or temporary expansion of cash and asset&#13;
transfers and/or subsidies, emergency public works, etc. (see Box 3)&#13;
   Box 3: Coping with disasters through scaling-up public works&#13;
   Besides promoting long-term risk reduction through its regular programming, the&#13;
   Bangladesh Chars Livelihoods Project (CLP) has helped protect those affected by floods in&#13;
   the aftermath of these shocks. In 2007, when severe flooding struck several regions of&#13;
   Bangladesh, causing losses of cash and food crops, and temporarily diminishing&#13;
   employment opportunities, it raised concerns regarding potential income and asset&#13;
   erosion of CLPâ&#128;&#153;s beneficiaries. To avert the use of negative coping strategies (e.g. distress&#13;
   sales of livestock, taking out private loans at exorbitant rates, etc.), and in response to a&#13;
   request from the Government of Bangladesh, the CLP expanded its public works activities&#13;
   by one million person days and into three further districts.&#13;
   Source: World Bank, 2013a.&#13;
&#13;
                    iii. Promotion&#13;
Social protection programs can be used to increase opportunities, by promoting human&#13;
capital development, access to sustainable livelihoods, and employment. In this way, they&#13;
can contribute to long-term resilience and climate change adaptation by helping households&#13;
diversify and/or enhance income and assets and by building institutional capacity to reduce&#13;
vulnerability to natural hazard and climate change impacts. Examples of this are: introducing&#13;
hazard-resilient crops into drought/flood prone communities; strengthening coordination&#13;
between social protection, disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation&#13;
agencies (CCA); raising awareness of DRM/CCA skills amongst social protection practitioners;&#13;
etc. (see Box 4).&#13;

&amp;#12;  Box 4: Providing opportunities for poor households through integrated risk management&#13;
  Recent evaluations of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s HARITA Program show that insurance mechanisms for&#13;
  subsistence farmers might allow them to transfer risk and free them to make higher-risk&#13;
  investments with higher returns. In 2010, in some of the villages where the program had&#13;
  rolled out, farmers who bought insurance planted more seeds and seemed to be switching&#13;
  to high-yielding-variety seeds at higher rates than did farmers who did not buy insurance.&#13;
  In addition, farmers who bought insurance tended to invest less family labor in agriculture&#13;
  and to diversify their sources of income relative to farmers who did not purchase&#13;
  insurance. They also experienced smaller losses of livestock than did farmers who did not&#13;
  buy insurance. More farmers who bought insurance for the second time reported that they&#13;
  expect to plant different crops, use more fertilizer, and obtain loans (Oxfam America,&#13;
  2011).&#13;

&amp;#12;Despite the fact that the positive links between social protection systems, DRM and CCA are&#13;
well established and understood, effective and systematic experiences of building those links&#13;
are few. In most cases, the use of these mechanisms to respond to natural disasters has been&#13;
ad hoc and ex-post, and although most times they have been relatively successful, they have&#13;
faced challenges at the design, implementation and coordination levels.&#13;
In terms of design, social protection programs are rarely prepared to address the risks and&#13;
impacts of natural hazards ahead of time. For instance, social protection targeting&#13;
mechanisms often fail to take into account climate and disaster vulnerability in advance,&#13;
meaning that many victims of relatively predictable shocks are missed when they occur.&#13;
Moreover, in some cases, the instruments and tools utilized in disaster response are limited&#13;
to short-term relief measures such as food, blankets and essential items. These short-term&#13;
responses miss the medium term recovery needs, and the importance of building long-term&#13;
risk management strategies. Finally, coordination between social protection agencies and&#13;
relevant agencies such as disaster risk management, meteorology and climate change&#13;
adaptation is often limited, meaning that responses are uncoordinated, sometimes&#13;
overlapping or leaving ostensible gaps.&#13;
By being prepared in advance, social protection systems might be able to respond to natural&#13;
disasters and climate-related shocks more effectively. Moreover, by focusing on reducing risk&#13;
and building resilience before shocks occur, they can help decrease the impacts of the shock&#13;
on those most vulnerable. A recent World Bank toolkit (http://preventionweb.net/go/42486)&#13;
on this particular topic suggests a series of aspects and principles to focus on when preparing&#13;
SP interventions to address disaster and climate risk upfront (World Bank, 2013a):&#13;
   a. Climate- and disaster-aware planning:&#13;
           â&#128;¢   acknowledging and hedging against uncertainty and planning for the greater&#13;
               frequency and severity of disasters;&#13;
           â&#128;¢   feedback loops with early warning systems and coordination with agencies&#13;
               responsible for meteorology and climate change; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              19&#13;
&amp;#12;              â&#128;¢     risk mapping to determine the impact of events on geographic areas and&#13;
                    physical, natural, and institutional assets.&#13;
   b. Interventions centered on livelihoods and assets: planning that reflects understanding&#13;
        of livelihood sources and economic decision making at the community and household&#13;
        level&#13;
   c. Building adaptive and response capacity at the system level: budgeting of adequate&#13;
        financing, human resources, and administrative systems.&#13;
A description of some of the country social protection programs that integrate the principles&#13;
of disaster- and climate- responsive SP is provided in Table 2. These principles will be explored&#13;
more in-depth in the context of PICs in Section 4.&#13;

            d. Context: Pacific island countries, risk and vulnerability&#13;
The Pacific Island region is extensive and diverse. This paper focuses on the ten World Bank&#13;
member countries, including Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,&#13;
Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Although not considered part of&#13;
Pacific Islands, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste are also considered here as important&#13;
players in the region. These countries have a population of over 10 million people, spread&#13;
across hundreds of islands, and scattered over an area equivalent to 15 percent of the globeâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
surface.&#13;
The region is extremely diverse, both in geographical and cultural terms. On one hand,&#13;
topography makes these countries very different, with some being part of what is called&#13;
â&#128;&#152;continental islandsâ&#128;&#153; which tend to be larger and prone to geological hazards, others being&#13;
â&#128;&#152;oceanic islandsâ&#128;&#153; (mainly volcanic islands), others being atolls with very small, low-lying land&#13;
areas and others â&#128;&#152;raised limestone islandsâ&#128;&#153;. Culturally, islands are generally divided between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   22&#13;
&amp;#12;Melanesia (PNG, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu)&#13;
and Micronesia (FSM, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and Palau). Although some of these tend to&#13;
be more homogenous (Polynesia), some islands are quite culturally diverse. For instance, in&#13;
Vanuatu, with only 250 thousand people, over 100 languages are spoken (Campbell, 2006).&#13;
In spite of this diversity, these countries are all greatly exposed to natural hazards given their&#13;
geographic and physical characteristics. Moreover, some of them are extremely vulnerable&#13;
to the effects of these hazards given their particular socioeconomic and environmental&#13;
context. The risks and particular vulnerabilities these countries face are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
                        i. Risks and vulnerability in the Pacific island countries&#13;
Pacific island countries experience a dangerous combination of natural hazards, high&#13;
exposure and high vulnerability that makes them particularly prone to disaster risk. According&#13;
to the 2012 World Risk Report (BÃ¼ndnis, Entwicklung and Hilft, 2012) five out of the 15&#13;
countries most at risk of disasters in the world are Pacific Island Countries3, with Vanuatu and&#13;
Tonga in first and second place, respectively (see Table 3) 4 . The World Risk Index (WRI)&#13;
measures risk based on the principle that frequency and strength of natural hazards do not&#13;
per se determine how likely a country is to experience disasters. Although natural hazards&#13;
themselves (earthquakes, cyclones, extreme rainfall, etc.) are largely outside human control,&#13;
disasters are not (World Bank, 2010), as they are the result of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s exposure and&#13;
vulnerability to those hazards. 5 The World Risk Index is based on the core understanding that&#13;
a societyâ&#128;&#153;s disaster risk is influenced by its structure, processes and framework conditions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
  Six countries out of 15 if Timor-Leste is taken into account.&#13;
4&#13;
  Vanuatu is the country with the largest disaster risk worldwide, followed by Tonga, the Philippines, Guatemala&#13;
and Bangladesh. Since the index is the product of exposure and vulnerability, it shows that these countries bear&#13;
the disastrous combination of extreme exposure and high vulnerability.&#13;
5 There are several indices that look at disaster and climate risks (Germanwatch Climate Risk Index, Global&#13;
Assessment Report by UNISDR, etc.). The WRI is discussed here because, in addition to exposure analysis, this&#13;
report focuses strongly on the vulnerability of the population, i.e. its susceptibility, its capacity to cope with and&#13;
to adapt to future natural events as well as the consequences of climate change. Disaster risk is seen as a&#13;
function of exposure and vulnerability. The World Risk Index is calculated by combining four individually&#13;
calculated components of exposure, susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptive capacities, with&#13;
these last three yielding the vulnerability index, which indicates whether a disaster may actually ensue should&#13;
an extreme natural event occur. The vulnerability index multiplied by the exposure index yields the World Risk&#13;
Index (BÃ¼ndnis Entwicklung Hilft, 2012).&#13;
&#13;

                                                         23&#13;
&amp;#12;which in turn may be affected by natural events and the effects of climate change. Besides&#13;
having high levels of exposure to hazards, PICs are highly vulnerable (see Table 3), due to a&#13;
combination of factors that drive up disaster and climate risk. An analysis of these factors&#13;
follows below.&#13;

    â&#128;¢     Hazards and Geographic Exposure&#13;
The Pacific is one of the regions most exposed to natural hazards; although the hazards vary&#13;
by sub-regions. For instance, although tropical cyclones are the most common hazard, many&#13;
countries lie along active fault lines, and as part of the â&#128;&#156;Pacific Ring of Fireâ&#128;&#157;, several of these&#13;
countries are exposed to a serious threat from earthquakes and tsunamis 6 . In addition,&#13;
although droughts are less common, they tend to affect the highest number of people per&#13;
event, as evidenced by data between 1950 and 2004 (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 Pacific island countries located in the southwestern region â&#128;&#147; primarily PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and&#13;
Tonga - are particularly at risk (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      24&#13;
&amp;#12;Different countries face specific risks. For instance, in the Solomon Islands, an earthquake&#13;
loss exceeding US$ 270 million (40 percent of GDP) is to be expected on average, once every&#13;
100 years, with earthquake risk being more prominent than cyclones. In Samoa, however, a&#13;
tropical cyclone loss exceeding US$ 134 million, which is equivalent to about 24 percent of&#13;
Samoaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP, is to be expected on average once every 100 years. In Samoa, tropical cyclone&#13;
losses are expected to be substantially more frequent and severe than losses due to&#13;
earthquake ground shaking and tsunamis (World Bank et al., 2011).&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Climate Change&#13;
According to IPCC (IPCC, 2012), a change in climate will lead to variations in the frequency,&#13;
intensity, extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events. According to&#13;
a study by the World Bank (2006), there is a strong evidence in the Pacific of an increase in&#13;
the observed frequency and intensity of weather and climate-related events. According to&#13;
this study, ten of the 15 most extreme events reported in the region in half a century have&#13;
occurred in the past 15 years.&#13;
Moreover, the climate also appears to be changing. A study that looked at climate trends,&#13;
between 1950 and 2004 shows that, while the southern Pacific seems to be experiencing a&#13;
significantly drier and warmer climate (by 15 percent and 0.8Ë&#154;C, respectively), the Central&#13;
Equatorial Pacific, by contrast, is experiencing more intense rain (representing a change of&#13;
about 30 percent) and a similarly hotter climate (0.6Ë&#154;C). Sea surface temperatures in both&#13;
areas have increased by about 0.4Ë&#154;C (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
The rate of climate change is likely to intensify in the future, in terms of both average and&#13;
extreme conditions. As average temperatures increase, sea level is expected to rise by&#13;
between 9 and 90 centimeters by the end of the century, with the eastern Pacific&#13;
experiencing the largest rise. Cyclones are expected to increase in intensity by about 5â&#128;&#147;20&#13;
percent. Storm frequency is likely to increase in the equatorial and northern Pacific. And in&#13;
general, the future climate is expected to see more droughts in the southern Pacific and more&#13;
rain and floods in the equatorial Pacific (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             25&#13;
&amp;#12;Climate change will exacerbate current risks from natural hazards. The climatic changes will&#13;
affect every aspect of life: freshwater supplies for natural systems, communities and&#13;
businesses; food security, threatened both through impacts on agriculture and fisheries;&#13;
infrastructure, as the risk from coastal flooding and erosion increases as sea levels rise.&#13;
Overall, in the coming decades, impacts are expected to become more widespread and more&#13;
severe (PIRCA).&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢     Other Factors that Contribute to PICâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to natural disasters&#13;
Besides being exposed to a high number of hydro-meteorological and geological hazards, PICs&#13;
as a whole have a set of other common economic and social characteristics that make them&#13;
vulnerable to disasters, such as:&#13;
   â&#128;¢     Small island states and limited natural resources&#13;
Small island developing states (SIDS) together with land-locked countries comprise about two&#13;
thirds of the countries with very high economic vulnerability to disasters (World Bank, 2010).&#13;
There are multiple reasons this is the case. First, as small landmasses in the middle of a vast&#13;
ocean, they are more exposed to weather inclemency and potentially high levels of losses. In&#13;
the case of small islands, economic development may be set back by decades due to disaster&#13;
impacts (SOPAC). Many of the 25 countries with natural disaster damages in a range of more&#13;
than 1 percent of GDP (in a sample of 175 countries) are small island economies (World Bank,&#13;
2010).&#13;
In addition, PICs have very limited natural resources and rely, for livelihoods, mostly on&#13;
coastal areas, where most of the populations and resources are located. Although the coastal&#13;
areas are the most highly diverse of the ecosystems, they are also extremely fragile and&#13;
vulnerable to change (SPREP). As these areas become more developed and over-utilized, an&#13;
increasing degradation of habitats, soils, forests, coastal and inland waters, reefs occurs, as&#13;
well as overexploitation of resources and growing conflicts in resource use and access.&#13;
   â&#128;¢     Narrowly based economies, import dependency and large distances to major&#13;
         markets, weak financial management and preparedness to deal with shocks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               26&#13;
&amp;#12;Most of the population in PICs (except Marshall Islands, Palau and Tuvalu) live in rural areas&#13;
and depends on the rural economy for their livelihoods. For instance, Solomon Islands and&#13;
Vanuatu are agrarian societies in which agriculture provides the overwhelming main source&#13;
of employment and livelihoods. The Fijian economy is more diversified, with a higher&#13;
percentage of the population living in urban areas. Yet agriculture employs 70 percent of the&#13;
labor force (World Bank, 2011a). Agriculture and subsistence activities (fishing) are very&#13;
sensitive to natural disasters and climate extremes.&#13;
Moreover, economic growth has been slow and the islandsâ&#128;&#153; links to global markets (open&#13;
economies importing food and essential items, and exporting agricultural products and&#13;
tourism) makes them highly exposed to global economic shocks (AusAID, 2012b). This&#13;
becomes a negative spiral, as the PICs have limited options for trade and economic&#13;
diversification, making them even more dependent on outside actors â&#128;&#147; both for aid and&#13;
remittances â&#128;&#147; when shocks hit.&#13;
Financial management and preparedness to deal with shocks in PICs is generally very small&#13;
due to their limited fiscal reserves and contingency budgets. There recently have been new&#13;
initiatives to pool risk at a sovereign level for a numbers of PICs, such as the PCRAFI risk&#13;
insurance pilot. However, the current payouts are very low (usually around 1-2 US$ million)&#13;
even in case of a major natural disaster. These insurance mechanisms need to be further&#13;
developed and their funding enhanced for them to play a bigger role in the disaster response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Urbanization and the breakup of traditional safety nets 7&#13;
In spite of the narrowly developed economies, approximately 36 percent of the Pacific&#13;
population (excluding PNG) lives in urban areas. Although by international standards the&#13;
absolute numbers of population may be small, the reduced land areas have given rise to&#13;
population densities comparable to highly populated countries in Asia (Wilkinson, 2011;&#13;
Haberkorn, 2008). Expansion is occurring in PICs small urban centers and is expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
    This section is largely based on Wilkinson, 2011.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        27&#13;
&amp;#12;continue over the next few decades, as they become centers of opportunity. This will also&#13;
make them hubs of social and environmental risk at the same time.&#13;
Significant proportions of urban areas in the Pacific are made up of poor housing or slums,&#13;
sometimes known as squatter or informal communities. These areas are usually beyond the&#13;
reach and services provided by local and central government. In addition, a large proportion&#13;
of young people in urban areas means that urban population growth will continue for several&#13;
years, creating further pressures. Poor land use planning also exacerbates risk.&#13;
Particularly relevant for disaster and climate change risks is the fact that, while the density of&#13;
urban life can be seen on the one hand to have relieved pressure on natural habitats and&#13;
biodiversity in rural areas, the impact on sensitive coastal ecosystems is intensifying in areas&#13;
of urban growth, placing urban populations at increasing risk of disease, coastal erosion, and&#13;
flooding. Much urban growth in the capital cities of the Melanesian countries (Fiji, Papua New&#13;
Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) is taking place in low lying and flood prone areas&#13;
not only placing these populations at risk of flooding, including tidal surges and tsunamis, but&#13;
also resulting in high levels of&#13;
environmental pollution through&#13;
lack of waste controls.&#13;
The World Bank (2004) noted that â&#128;&#156;growing urbanization and squatter settlements,&#13;
degradation of coastal ecosystems, and rapidly developing infrastructure on coastal areas are&#13;
intensifying the [Pacific] islandsâ&#128;&#153; exposure to extreme weather events.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Although in the past Pacific people have built traditional practices for resilience to natural&#13;
disasters, these adaptation mechanisms are being lost as people migrate to the cities and to&#13;
fragile coastal areas. Moreover, the breakup of families due to urban migration is resulting in&#13;
the weakening of traditional safety nets and community coping mechanisms. At the same&#13;
time, urban safety nets are non-existent and people lack coping mechanisms in the face of&#13;
shocks. The lack of institutional capacity is another factor in vulnerability, including capacity&#13;
to forecast and disseminate early warning messages to scattered population.&#13;
&#13;
                   ii. Poverty and hardship in Pacific island countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               28&#13;
&amp;#12;In PICs, traditionally the idea that the community, clan or family would support those in need&#13;
meant that nobody was supposed to fall into poverty. Until recently, most countries in the&#13;
region considered poverty as a foreign concept, and indeed many still do. However, this&#13;
concept around the non-existence of absolute poverty is gradually changing as economic&#13;
forces, systemic shocks and urbanization erode traditional safety nets and more governments&#13;
recognize that a significant proportion of the population may face difficulties meeting basic&#13;
needs.&#13;
Nevertheless, extreme poverty, defined as the proportion of the population living below US$&#13;
1.25 a day, is largely considered an irrelevant concept in the Pacific context due to the high&#13;
dependence on subsistence living and traditional social safety nets (Pacific Islands Forum&#13;
Secretariat, 2011). In general, hunger and destitution are still rare in the region and many&#13;
prefer to use the term â&#128;&#152;hardshipâ&#128;&#153; or poverty of opportunity, which has been defined as a lack&#13;
of basic services, a lack of opportunities to participate in the economy and a lack of adequate&#13;
resources to meet the basic needs of the household or customary social obligations (Abbott&#13;
and Pollard, 2004).&#13;
Thus, while food poverty in these&#13;
countries is relatively low â&#128;&#147; 2 to 5 percent in Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu,&#13;
and 9 to 13 percent in FSM and Solomon Islands, the population living below the (national)&#13;
Basic Needs Poverty Lines is significantly higher, with most countries ranging from 25 to 30&#13;
percent (see Table 4).&#13;

&#13;
In addition, income and expenditure distribution curves in Pacific island countries are&#13;
generally quite flat around the poverty line, which points to a high level of vulnerability to&#13;
poverty in the region (ADB, 2010b). Since much of the population lives just above the poverty&#13;
line, even small events can push many into poverty. This fact, combined with other socio-&#13;
economic factors, increases peopleâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to climate and natural hazard risks.&#13;
Some of the factors that increase hardship and vulnerability are 8:&#13;
       â&#128;¢   An increased demand for cash and monetization of the economy, as the population&#13;
           becomes more urbanized and less reliant on subsistence agriculture. This, combined&#13;
           with reliance on expensive imported food (due to long distances), and social&#13;
           obligations (church, community) means households might be cashâ&#128;&#147;strapped and&#13;
           resort to harmful coping mechanism (e.g. reducing consumption of nutritious food);&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Inadequate health and education services, low literacy rates, limited opportunities for&#13;
           secondary schooling (due to fees/quality) and the rise of life-style diseases (diabetes,&#13;
           hypertension) which put pressure on already inadequate health services;&#13;

&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   High unemployment, especially among young people, which often forces people to&#13;
       migrate for jobs;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Exposure to political and economic shocks, as was demonstrated by the impact of the&#13;
       triple fuel, food and financial crisis in 2008;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Limited financial services and very low levels of savings and access to credit that allow&#13;
       households to cope in the face of shocks;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Large dependency ratios, translating into households with children and elderly being&#13;
       the poorest; very low levels of social security and pensions; and&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Weakening forms of traditional support and unequal distribution of it.&#13;
&#13;
Groups most at risk are children, the elderly, women and the disabled. In particular, the ADB&#13;
study (ADB, 2010a) identified the following population groups as being vulnerable through a&#13;
lack of access to economic resources, education and health services, employment and credit,&#13;
and infrastructure and markets: (i) rural communities, particularly rural children; (ii) rural&#13;
women involved in both subsidence and wage activities; (iii) out-of-school and unemployed&#13;
youth; (iv) landless peopleâ&#128;&#148;outer island and inland migrants to coastal towns and cities; (v)&#13;
low-paid wage workersâ&#128;&#148;the formal and informal sector working poor; (vi) disabled people&#13;
for whom facilities for education, training, and rehabilitation, including opportunities for&#13;
employment, are limited; (vii) the destitute, comprising deserted wives, widows, single&#13;
parents, the chronically ill, the severely disabled, and the aged; and (viii) children of the poor.&#13;
Some evidence suggests that in the absence of formal risk coping mechanisms or informal&#13;
support, during times of hardship, vulnerable groups will increasingly be forced into poverty-&#13;
entrenching support mechanisms (ADB, 2010a). For example, in Samoa, children have been&#13;
taken out of school either because their parents have been unable to afford to pay school&#13;
fees or so that children could earn income for their families in the absence of other sources&#13;
of livelihood (Chibber, 2009).&#13;

&amp;#12;   II. Analysis of Social Protection and Disaster and Climate Risk Management in the&#13;
       Pacific&#13;
           a. Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation in the Pacific&#13;
                 Islands â&#128;&#147; current situation and constraints&#13;
Informal, community-based measures to reduce the risks and impacts of natural disasters in&#13;
the Pacific Islands have a strong tradition. Communities have long carried out disaster risk&#13;
management activities by themselves, usually focusing on intra and inter community&#13;
cooperation, food security, traditional knowledge and settlements (Campbell, 2006). For&#13;
instance, food surplus has usually been stored and preserved for times of hardship, and&#13;
houses built on mounds to reduce the risk of flooding. However, some of the more recent&#13;
economic and social changes have undermined many of these practices. For instance, as&#13;
populations become more urbanized, they move into highly vulnerable areas, while&#13;
abandoning traditional food security mechanisms.&#13;
As traditional practices loose effectiveness â&#128;&#147; not only due to socio-economic and cultural&#13;
changes, but also due to increasing frequency and unpredictability of climate shocks â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
need for formal, holistic, contextualized disaster risk management and climate change&#13;
adaptation measures becomes increasingly evident.&#13;
Although funding for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation has increased&#13;
in the last decade (World Bank, 2006b), most of the focus seems to traditionally have been&#13;
placed on more reactive disaster response. Disaster response has usually been focused on&#13;
providing short-term relief in the form of in-kind commodities such as food, relief kits, shelter,&#13;
etc. Some of these activities have sometimes been followed by limited-scale recovery efforts,&#13;
such as housing reconstruction, small shelter solutions, etc. In general, PICs have limited&#13;
financial and institutional capacity for large-scale disaster response, and thus rely on&#13;
international donors (Australia, New Zealand, Red Cross, the UN system and large&#13;
international NGOs) for relief after major disasters.&#13;
In addition, the actions taken so far for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation&#13;
seem to not have been sufficient for sustained and systematic progress on-the ground (World&#13;
Bank, 2009a). There is a need for stronger commitments and action by governments at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               32&#13;
&amp;#12;several levels, including political, regulatory and sectoral actions (World Bank, 2009a). Several&#13;
constraints impede increasing the effectiveness of activity in this sector, including9:&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Disaster response and risk reduction are mostly financed by external donors and&#13;
         remain outside of the national budget&#13;
A great proportion of the activities destined to reduce risks of or help cope with the impacts&#13;
of natural disasters and shocks are financed by international donors, and funds are not&#13;
provided through national budgets. This leads to uncoordinated action and fragmentation, as&#13;
well as a short-term project focus that impedes sustained action and ownership. Moreover,&#13;
some have pointed out that this situation incentivizes activities in disaster response at the&#13;
expense of risk reduction; while disaster response has high visibility and can be funded off-&#13;
budget, preparedness and risk reduction require day-to-day commitment. Thus, while donors&#13;
continue to contribute to response generously, governments have little incentive to invest in&#13;
risk reduction (World Bank, 2006b).&#13;
As a result, PIC governments tend to consider the need for climate change adaptation and&#13;
much of disaster risk reduction as being externally driven and thus expect that activities will&#13;
be externally funded (World Bank, 2009a). A study of external assistance for DRM and CCA&#13;
(Gero et al., 2011) found that while there was ongoing support from both donors and PIC&#13;
national budgets for these interventions with a view to build adaptive capacity, the bulk of&#13;
the support was donor funded.&#13;
As the strong reliance on external assistance threatens to undermine the building of a&#13;
national system for disaster and climate risk reduction, this has led regional organizations,&#13;
donors and international partners to consider ways to assist PICs to build internal capacity to&#13;
respond to their own needs. Moreover, some countries in the region have taken the lead in&#13;
building a coordinated national response and risk reduction system. For instance, Vanuatu&#13;
has recognized this problem and requires that any external technical assistance be aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 Only those constraints and characteristics that are relevant to the topic of this note are presented here. Many&#13;
others can be described that are particular to the DRM sector in the Pacific. Literature on this is included in the&#13;

  in Vanuatu and the UNâ&#128;&#153;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Pacific&#13;
  (OCHA). It was established based on the recognition that humanitarian stakeholders with&#13;
  a presence in the country could strengthen the preparedness and response capacity in&#13;
  certain sectors or clusters, as well as the NDMOâ&#128;&#153;s capacity, through providing consistent&#13;
  on-ground support and access to personnel and other resources. Here, Government&#13;
  ministries lead clusters in agriculture and food security, emergency education, health,&#13;
  logistics and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene). Members of the VHT support the&#13;
  Government ministries as cluster co-leads.&#13;
  Since its establishment, the VHT has assisted with the response to Tropical Cyclone (TC)&#13;
  Jasmine and TC Pam in March 2015. The VHT is included as an integral component in the&#13;
  NDMOâ&#128;&#153;s tsunami-and-cyclone response preparedness plans, as well as Standard Operating&#13;
  Procedures (SOPs). The VHT is also extending disaster preparedness support at the&#13;
  provincial level within Vanuatu as well as assisting the NDMO to develop SOPs to&#13;
  strengthen coordination between Port Vila and the provinces.&#13;

   â&#128;¢   DRM and CCA are not fully mainstreamed into national budgets, sectors and&#13;
       programs&#13;
A regional study (World Bank, 2009a) found that across the region, there are universally weak&#13;
institutional frameworks at national level for defining roles, accountabilities, and linkages&#13;
across sectors and between levels of government, in ways that would effectively&#13;
operationalize existing or emerging national hazard risk management policies. This includes&#13;
links between disaster risk management and climate change adaptation themselves, but also&#13;
with other sectors that are relevant for development, such as social protection.&#13;
Recently, some governments have increased their commitment to institutionalizing DRM and&#13;
CCA, including preparing national DRM/CCA strategies and actions plans. For example, Samoa&#13;
has a National Action plan for DRM 2011-2016. In Timor-Leste, the National Disaster&#13;
Management Office (NDMO) is part of the Ministry of Social Affairs, which would make it easy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             34&#13;
&amp;#12;to coordinate DRM and SP agendas. 10&#13;
Nevertheless, governments and development partners should increase efforts to ensure&#13;
sustainable financing and institutionalization of DRM and CCA. As suggested by the World&#13;
Bank (2012a), improved coordination between DRM and CCA institutions and greater&#13;
involvement by relevant ministries would increase PICs governmentsâ&#128;&#153; ability to carry out&#13;
integrated and intersectoral approaches that are needed for climate resilient development,&#13;
while also reducing inefficiencies in the use of scarce resources.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Limited human resources and institutional capacity at the national level&#13;
A recurrent theme across PICs is the lack of adequate human resources and institutional&#13;
capacity, and the disaster risk management and climate change adaptation sectors are not&#13;
an exception. Disaster response relies on very few people with limited resources (Gero et al.,&#13;
2011), which increases the vulnerability of these countries to disaster risk. On the other hand,&#13;
there are a multitude of donors active in the disaster risk reduction and climate change&#13;
adaptation sectors, but often they provide more technical assistance than these countries are&#13;
able to absorb (World Bank, 2009a).&#13;
According to a regional study (World Bank, 2009a), significant barriers to effective risk&#13;
reduction are the relatively low-level availability and utilization of relevant knowledge, skills,&#13;
wider understanding, and decision-support tools; and shortfalls in data management and&#13;
information-sharing mechanisms. It is important that human resource capacity is improved&#13;
in terms of the numbers, skills, competencies, deployment and co-ordination required to&#13;
respond to natural disasters. Moreover, it is important to find synergies and collaboration&#13;
between disaster risk management and climate change adaptation sector, but also with other&#13;
sectors, to ensure resources, knowledge and skills are used as efficiently as possible.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Limited data availability&#13;
A cross-country study of seven countries in the region (World Bank, 2009a) found that in the&#13;
previous 10-15 years there had been a widespread degradation of hazard and climate&#13;
monitoring and information management systems, which impeded the identification of&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                35&#13;
&amp;#12;areas, assets, operations, and communities at risk as well as their vulnerabilities. Due to&#13;
scarce resources, lack of knowledge or technical capacity, etc., governments and donors often&#13;
prefer not to fund long-term data collection activities even if essential for supporting&#13;
informed decision-making.&#13;
Moreover, even in those countries where data is reasonably adequate, there is little cross-&#13;
sector coordination that allows other agencies to access and utilize that data effectively. The&#13;
capacity to share and access data across sectors is crucial.&#13;
Finally, there is also an extreme urgency to update both the need for and current capabilities&#13;
of appropriate early warning systems (World Bank, 2009a), as most of these countries rely on&#13;
other countriesâ&#128;&#153; EWS systems.&#13;
Some efforts have taken place in past years to improve this situation. The Pacific Catastrophe&#13;
Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) aims to provide 15 countries in the region&#13;
with disaster risk assessment tools to help them better understand, model, and assess their&#13;
exposure to natural disasters, as part of the broader agenda on disaster risk management&#13;
and climate change adaptation in the Pacific region (World Bank, n.d.). 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Limited community involvement in formal risk reduction activities&#13;
Implementation of risk-reducing measures has largely been through a top-down approach,&#13;
and for many countries there is a sizable gap between the village or community level and the&#13;
provincial or national level at which scientific knowledge, mainstreaming, and capacity&#13;
building are usually directed (World Bank, 2009a). Often this reflects the manner in which&#13;
information or assistance is provided, frequently inappropriate in the native cultural or&#13;
organizational context.&#13;
&#13;

  The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) is a joint initiative of SOPAC/SPC,&#13;
World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank with the financial support of the Government of Japan, the Global&#13;
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction&#13;
Programme, and technical support from AIR Worldwide, New Zealand GNS Science, Geoscience Australia, Pacific&#13;

&amp;#12;Recently, however, some organizations have recognized that tangible benefits need to be&#13;
delivered at the local level, where needs are the greatest, and are starting to increase the&#13;
emphasis on community-based adaptation, management or natural resources and&#13;
community-based disaster risk management (World Bank, 2009a).&#13;
&#13;
For instance, the World Bank has recently approved the Community Resilience to Climate and&#13;
Disaster Risk Project for Solomon Islands (CRISP), which aims to increase the capacity of&#13;
selected rural communities to manage natural hazards and climate change risks. The project&#13;
will support both structural and non-structural disaster risk and adaptation investments at&#13;
the community and provincial level, including, among other activities, risk analysis, design,&#13;
development and implementation of community-led rural investments (World Bank, 2014).&#13;
&#13;
             b. Social protection in the Pacific island countries&#13;
Social Protection is a relatively new, but growing area of government intervention in PICs. As&#13;
traditional informal safety nets weaken and community and faith-based groups are only able&#13;
to offer a limited range of services (e.g., to orphans and disabled people) to make up for the&#13;
failing of those traditional mechanisms, governments are recognizing the need to establish&#13;
more formal mechanisms.&#13;
Although some countries in the region already have some formal social protection programs&#13;
in place, they tend to be small. The low scores of most PICs in the Asian Development Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Social Protection Index 12 seem to confirm that these systems are weak (ADB, 2010a). Some&#13;
of the most developed interventions are in Fiji and Kiribati, which have complex cash&#13;
transfers. 13 Other countries like Vanuatu are just beginning to consider the Stateâ&#128;&#153;s role in the&#13;
provision of social risk management interventions. In most countries, there are concerns&#13;
about welfare dependency and the role of the State in re-distribution. However, with growing&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
   ADB has developed a social protection index that includes four quantitative indicators to measure and&#13;
compare the adequacy of social protection in its member countries. The indicators include (1) expenditure on&#13;
social protection (as a percentage of gross domestic product), (2) coverage of social protection programs in&#13;
terms of the extent to which they reach their target populations, (3) poverty targeting in terms of the proportion&#13;
of poor who receive social protection transfers, and (4) impact of social protection expenditures measured as&#13;
the average expenditure on social protection per person living below the poverty line (ADB, 2010a).&#13;

                                                       37&#13;
&amp;#12;poverty and hardship, there is also a recognition that government intervention might be&#13;
needed to close the gap. 14 In any case, overall social protection coverage ratios are low -&#13;
ranging from 30 percent of target population receiving some form of formal social protection&#13;
in Nauru to only 1 percent of target groups in PNG (ADB, 2010a).&#13;
The predominant form of social protection seems to be social insurance programs for formal&#13;
workers and the elderly. Most PICs have established provident funds or superannuation&#13;
schemes that provide pensions for formal sector workers, particularly retired civil servants&#13;
(ADB, 2010a; AusAID, 2010). However, most social insurance programs reach only a small part&#13;
of the workforce and elderly people.&#13;
Universal old age pensions are the most common type of non-contributory social protection&#13;
(AusAID, 2010). Some countries, such as Fiji, Kiribati and Samoa, have introduced universal&#13;
income support for the elderly. In Samoa, the cost of the scheme represents 1 percent of GDP&#13;
(AusAID, 2010).&#13;
Some cash transfer schemes exist, although they are also limited. The Poverty Benefit Scheme&#13;
(PBS) in Fiji, which replaced Family Assistance Program (FAP) in2013, is the largest cash&#13;
transfer in the region, aimed to reach the poorest 10 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population. The&#13;
design elements of PBS are intended to move from categorical targeting of elderly, disabled&#13;
and chronically ill (under FAP), to poverty targeting through standardized household welfare&#13;
assessments. It is expected that the reform will significantly contribute to focusing the benefit&#13;
on reducing poverty incidence in the country.&#13;
Many PICs provide free basic education and health services to the general population.&#13;
Recently, in response to the hardship faced by vulnerable groups in Samoa, Solomon Islands,&#13;
and Vanuatu, â&#128;&#156;fee-freeâ&#128;&#157; primary education schemes were introduced with substantial&#13;
support from donors. However, the quality of service remains poor in many countries, and&#13;
access is generally limited outside of urban areas, particularly in larger, more populous&#13;
countries such as Solomon Islands (ADB, 2010a).&#13;

                                               38&#13;
&amp;#12;A few countries, with the support from donors, have established one-off public works&#13;
programs, although often their goal has been to build infrastructure, with the employment&#13;
objective as secondary (AusAID, 2010). For instance, in the Solomon Islands, the Cash for&#13;
Work pilot program provided wages and tools to target communities for the clean-up and&#13;
repair of public areas and infrastructure (common gardens, halls and churches, schools, wells,&#13;
drains and paths) that were damaged by flash floods in 2014. A study by AusAID (2010) found&#13;
that, in some previous projects, wage rates had been established well above market wage,&#13;
with the potential of distorting labor markets.&#13;
In the region, Government capacity to design, implement, and monitor social protection&#13;
programs remains limited. The data on vulnerable groups is poor and is not often collected&#13;
on a regular basis, which makes identifying and monitoring vulnerable groups difficult. This&#13;
may be a reason why some PICs governments have opted for a universal benefit (ADB, 2010a).&#13;
Finally, involving community and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in the delivery of&#13;
basic social services, particularly to vulnerable groups, is common across the Pacific. Such&#13;
groups are normally decentralized and well integrated into existing social structures. In many&#13;
Pacific countries, governments and community organizations such as churches have&#13;
established partnerships, particularly in the health and education sectors. Community&#13;
delivery of basic social services not only builds on the strong tradition of community support&#13;
networks in the region, but also assists in overcoming capacity and financial resource&#13;
constraints that limit the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to provide broad basic service coverage to the&#13;
entire population, particularly in rural areas (ABD, 2010a).&#13;
&#13;
             c. How do social protection interventions currently address the risks from&#13;
                 disasters and climate volatility in the Pacific?&#13;
There is little evidence that formal social protection mechanisms to date have been used&#13;
either for disaster response 15 or for reducing risks arising from climatic and natural hazards,&#13;
with the exception of ex-post cash-for-work (CFW) programs, such as the one developed in&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
  A study by Naidu, V. and Moharty, M. (2009) â&#128;&#156;Situational Analysis of Social Protection Policies, Services and&#13;
Delivery Mechanisms in the Pacificâ&#128;&#157; mentions that at least Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu&#13;
have a mechanism called â&#128;&#156;Disaster victim assistanceâ&#128;&#157; but no details have been found.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      39&#13;
&amp;#12;Tonga by UNDP. Given the level of institutional development and coordination of both the&#13;
social protection and the disaster risk management sectors, their limited budgets and human&#13;
resources, this situation is not unexpected.&#13;
A recent Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) found evidence that, after cyclone Evan in&#13;
December 2012, the government of Fiji was using Provident Funds as an ad hoc one-off&#13;
mechanism for disaster response (Government of Fiji, 2013). Similarly, 5,000 workers under&#13;
the Vanuatu National Provident Fund have applied to withdraw 20% of their retirement funds&#13;
post-TC Pam that hit Vanuatu in March 2015. The government opened access to the&#13;
provident funds for a set amount of money as a means of providing people access to funds&#13;
for recovery. Thus, people who chose to take this option would be accessing funds from their&#13;
retirement savings to cover the needs arising after the disaster.&#13;
This type of intervention may be problematic at several levels. First, and more importantly,&#13;
this measure is not sustainable in the long term, as it implies extracting funds from old-age&#13;
savings, which run the risk of becoming depleted before reaching their intended use period.&#13;
Second, since there is a very small formal sector that contributes to these funds, and there is&#13;
very low coverage of poor or vulnerable households in these schemes, the intervention might&#13;
not have reached those most in need for response after the disaster. Finally, this seems to&#13;
have been an ad hoc mechanism that is not part of a systematic plan for disaster response,&#13;
and it is unsustainable in the long run.&#13;
Another mechanism that may help have an effect for small-scale farmersâ&#128;&#153; resilience to shocks&#13;
might be the Copra Subsidy Schemeâ&#128;&#148;Kiribatiâ&#128;&#153;s largest social protection programâ&#128;&#148;which&#13;
helps farmers cope with fluctuations in copra prices by guaranteeing a minimum purchase&#13;
price from government. This maintains copra production in the outer islands and protects&#13;
famersâ&#128;&#153; assets when prices are low. However, the program might not be sustainable because&#13;
it maintains an artificially high price for copra, while providing inequitable support to&#13;
households, as those with less labor capacity receive smaller subsidies even though they are&#13;
vulnerable. Moreover the scheme is quite expensive and runs at a significant fiscal loss to the&#13;
Government. Core social protection instrumentsâ&#128;&#148;such as cash transfers or cash for workâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
may tackle underlying risks more cost effectively and equitably (AusAID, 2012b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               40&#13;
&amp;#12;In terms of informal social protection mechanisms, it is well known that one of the risk&#13;
management strategies utilized by Pacific islanders involves migration, both domestic and&#13;
international. Migration not only allows migrants to send remittances home, but it is also part&#13;
of a risk management strategy to escape environmental pressures and risks in some areas.&#13;
Mohanty (2011) notes that people are migrating from low-lying, smaller and outer islands to&#13;
larger islands in search of secured land with hopes of minimizing the impact of environmental&#13;
and climatic change. However, migration opportunities might be limited for some of the&#13;
poorest and most vulnerable households, often located in the most remote communities&#13;
(AusAID, 2012a).&#13;
Through migration, however, remittances become important forms of risk management for&#13;
those who are left behind. For instance, a study on disaster remittances following a cyclone&#13;
in Samoa found that amounts remitted rose steeply in response to the cyclone, achieving&#13;
about 25 per cent of the total value of the losses incurred by recipient families (Macpherson&#13;
1994 in AusAID, 2012a). More recently, in December 2009, a remarkable upsurge in&#13;
remittances to Samoa occurred after the tsunami (Gibson 2010 in AusAID, 2012a).&#13;
Other types of informal coping mechanism might revolve around informal lending and&#13;
borrowing from family and friends. While the latter might not be very effective in the case of&#13;
systemic shocks, the former has the potential of being harmful if interest rates are high and&#13;
conditions are onerous meaning those households might sink further down in poverty.&#13;
Finally, Mohanty (2011) points out that the credit union systems also work for those who are&#13;
not covered by formal social insurance schemes. Credit unions provide a sense of support to&#13;
those without regular employment. In Fiji, for instance, there are several community-,&#13;
profession- or company-based credit unions that act as â&#128;&#156;safety netsâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
           d. How should social protection integrate disaster response and climate&#13;
               resilience in the Pacific Island Countries?&#13;
As highlighted earlier in this note, the Pacific Island Countries are highly exposed to natural&#13;
disaster risk. Climate change will contribute to further compounding those risks, exerting&#13;
renewed pressure on these countriesâ&#128;&#153; disaster risk management systems and impacting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;poorest and most vulnerable. As the countries in this region consider expanding and&#13;
reforming their social protection systems, it is crucial that they consider disaster and climate&#13;
considerations as key risk factors for their target populations.&#13;
If designed well, social protection programs play a key role in helping households cope with&#13;
the short-term impacts of shocks, as has been demonstrated by several studies. For instance,&#13;
evaluations of the cash and voucher programs used in humanitarian emergencies, such as in&#13;
response to the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 (e.g., in Thailand, Indonesia, India&#13;
and Sri Lanka) and the South Asia earthquake in 2005 (e.g., in Pakistan) found evidence that&#13;
beneficiaries largely spent the cash on necessities such as food, clothing and school fees,&#13;
which helped them cope with the shock (Parks et al., 2009). Moreover, if provided&#13;
systematically and predictably, social protection transfers can reduce long term risk by&#13;
helping poor households build savings, an asset-base or human capital.&#13;
In general, based on the international evidence, a social protection system in the Pacific that&#13;
takes climate and disaster risks into account will need to have the following characteristics 16:&#13;
                       i. Climate and Disaster aware Planning&#13;
Whether designing a new social protection intervention or adapting an existing one,&#13;
policymakers and practitioners in countries at risk for natural disasters need to be mindful of&#13;
the particular nature of the risks and how they might affect vulnerable populations. This&#13;
requires:&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢   Acknowledging uncertainty and building the necessary contingency and&#13;
              information mechanisms, such as information from early warning systems, into&#13;
              social protection interventions to deal with disaster risk;&#13;
          â&#128;¢   Risk mapping to determine how different hazards might affect a geographic area&#13;
              and which human, physical, natural, or institutional assets need to be supported&#13;
              or strengthened;&#13;

&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Incorporating climate- and disaster considerations into the targeting system by&#13;
           using area- and household-level data on hazard exposure to inform targeting,&#13;
           distinguishing the chronic poor from those at risk of falling into transitory poverty,&#13;
           etc. Climate and disaster targeting can be done as part of regular SP programs in&#13;
           areas at high risk or for particularly vulnerable populations. Alternatively, targeting&#13;
           methods can be adapted post-disaster to reach those affected (see Box 6).&#13;
  Box 6: Climate and disaster responsive targeting&#13;
  In Bangladesh, the Char Livelihoods Project (CLP) targets only poor communities living on&#13;
  fluvial islands (chars), which are highly vulnerable to flooding and climate change impacts.&#13;
  In Ethiopia, the PSNP covers geographic regions and districts that are famine-prone (i.e.,&#13;
  highly climate-vulnerable, usually due to droughts). The PSNP further includes a household&#13;
  level criterion focused on severe asset loss over time, which is sensitive to the cumulative&#13;
  effect of both disaster and economic shocks.&#13;
  In addition, the PSNP has a scalability feature, which allows it to increase coverage in&#13;
  response to extreme weather events â&#128;&#147; supporting transitorily food-insecure populations&#13;
  that have been affected by shocks. The program relies on a contingency budget and a risk&#13;
  financing mechanisms to scale up effectively and reach chronic and transitory food-&#13;
  insecure populations.&#13;

&#13;
Traditionally, targeting of formal social protection interventions in the Pacific Island countries&#13;
has been limited given low capacity and scarce data. The World Bank and other development&#13;
partners (e.g., DFAT) are currently collaborating to increase the availability of data and to&#13;
improve targeting mechanisms in selected PICs. For instance, as part of this effort, the World&#13;
Bank has worked with the government of Fiji to incorporate a module on householdsâ&#128;&#153; shocks&#13;
and coping mechanisms as part of the 2013/14 Household Income and Expenditure Survey&#13;
(HIES). This will allow collecting data to understand the shocks households are exposed to&#13;
and their risk management strategies.&#13;
Given the data constraints that exist for the disaster risk management sector as signaled&#13;
above, as well as limitations that exist in the setup of early warning systems, a potential entry&#13;
point for agencies working on social protection would be to collaborate with disaster&#13;
management and meteorology agencies on building effective databases on vulnerability. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;would allow coordination among agencies, a more effective use of resources and&#13;
supplementing some of the data needs of the disaster management system.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, some PICs are currently in the process of reviewing and reforming targeting&#13;
mechanisms for their SP programs, which will increase their efficiency in reaching the poorest&#13;
and most vulnerable. Throughout the review of these mechanisms, it is critical to consider&#13;
climate and natural hazard risks as important factors of vulnerability and hardship, especially&#13;
as they play a role in creating and perpetuating poverty. Finally, as these mechanisms are&#13;
reformed or created, it would be important to assess ways in which they can be rolled out to&#13;
address the needs of disaster victims when shocks hit.&#13;
&#13;
                   ii. Interventions centered on livelihoods and assets&#13;
&#13;
When designing SP interventions to address disaster risk and response, it is important to take&#13;
into account how livelihoods and assets might be impacted by different risks and what&#13;
economic decisions households and communities make to sustain livelihoods in face of these&#13;
pressures. This might help identify the right level and mix of instruments to encourage&#13;
healthy risk-taking behavior and livelihoods diversification. For instance, in some cases, cash&#13;
transfers can help build savings and an asset base, but in others, community assets for&#13;
disaster risk reduction (e.g. planting mangroves in coastal zones) might be more relevant.&#13;
Likewise, in some cases, where there are no other viable alternatives, resettlement might be&#13;
the only option, but this should be carefully considered given the inherent challenges it faces.&#13;
It is important to keep in mind that the goals should be:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Strengthening social, physical and natural community assets in a way that&#13;
           increases resilience to shocks; and&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Supporting viable livelihoods to ensure long-term sustainability (see Box 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 7: Working with communities to strengthen livelihoods and community assets&#13;
  HARITA/R4 Initiative, an 'insurance-for-work' scheme implemented in Ethiopia, gives poor&#13;
  farmers the option to pay for insurance by working on small-scale community-identified&#13;
  projects that build climate resilience and agricultural productivity, such as improved&#13;
&#13;

  payouts to the client farmers are triggered if rainfall drops below a predetermined&#13;

  In order for the insurance mechanism to work in poor communities, HARITA/R4 has&#13;
  focused on educating poor and largely illiterate farmers about the benefits of insurance,&#13;
  as well as on ensuring that the insurance product meets their needs, while building trust&#13;
  between the insurance providers and farmers. Communities have actively participated in&#13;
  the development of the products, resulting in what many consider to be an attractive&#13;
  micro-insurance package (Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2011). Farmer design teams are&#13;
  formed in each village; they work with program implementers to develop product options&#13;
  that are identified as meeting their needs. These teams also play a key role in the design,&#13;
  monitoring, and evaluation of HARITA/R4's climate resilience-building public works.&#13;

&#13;
In PICs, it seems that formal social protection mechanisms have not traditionally focused on&#13;
strengthening community assets or supporting livelihoods for individuals. New data&#13;
collection initiatives, such as the one described in the previous sub-section, will most likely&#13;
allow PICs governments understand better what shocks householdsâ&#128;&#153; livelihoods and&#13;
community assets are exposed to and how they manage those shocks. A better&#13;
understanding of peopleâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to shocks and coping mechanisms might provide an&#13;
opportunity to increase the role of SP interventions along the promotion function, especially&#13;
those that aim to enhance human capital (conditional cash transfer, but also skills and training&#13;
programs) as well as community and individual assets (asset transfers, public works).&#13;
&#13;
In addition, traditional social protection mechanisms need to be better understood and&#13;
strengthened where possible (Parks et al., 2009). In this direction, another entry point for&#13;
social protection agencies might be to promote the use of community-based and civil society&#13;
mechanisms for identifying both households and community vulnerability to climate shocks&#13;
and natural disasters, and assessing the appropriate interventions based on communitiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
inputs.&#13;
                  iii. Building Adaptive and Response Capacity at System Level&#13;
&#13;
Traditional, informal safety nets become inadequate when faced with the disproportionate&#13;
increases of covariate risk brought about by natural disasters and climate change. As shocks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              45&#13;
&amp;#12;from natural disasters become systemic, they affect those in the community who cannot rely&#13;
on their family and neighbors for support. This type of risk requires social protection&#13;
programs that are responsive and adaptive in the face of large systemic shocks. Building&#13;
adaptive and responsive SP systems will require:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    Developing appropriate institutional capacity and coordination with DRM and climate&#13;
     change agencies to tap into combined expertise and institutional capacity. This is&#13;
     challenging because DRM/CCA and SP agencies often work in isolation from each other&#13;
     and have different approaches and focus. Social protection agencies often lack skills,&#13;
     knowledge and experience on how to integrate DRM/CCA into programs and systems,&#13;
     etc. For these reasons, it is important to promote inter-agency collaboration and working&#13;
     across disciplines; coordination and collaboration with the international humanitarian&#13;
     response system in post-disaster context; and undertaking capacity development&#13;
     activities (See Box 8).&#13;
    Box 8: Institutional coordination in Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Temporary Employment Program (PET)&#13;
    The PET is an inter-agency program overseen by the Ministry of Social Welfare (SEDESOL)&#13;
    and implemented by several sector ministries and agencies, including the Transport and&#13;
    Communications Ministry, the Agriculture and Natural Resources Ministry and the&#13;
    Ministry of Labor. A PET Technical Commission has the role of strengthening institutional&#13;
    coordination in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the program,&#13;
    as well as coordinating resources to obtain maximum socioeconomic impact.&#13;
    Moreover, SEDESOL is co-signatory to a Parliamentary Act with the Ministry of Interiorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    department in charge of the Government of Mexico's emergency and recovery response&#13;
    to natural disasters. The Ministry of the Interior is tasked with the oversight of a&#13;
    coordinated institutional response to natural disasters, and the management of a major&#13;
    national disaster response contingency fund, the Natural Disasters Fund (FONDEN).&#13;
    Emergency response, including some contingency financing, is coordinated by SEGOB with&#13;
    line ministries implementing previously defined functions.&#13;
    Source: World Bank, 2013a.&#13;
&#13;
     The collaboration between social protection, disaster management and climate change&#13;
     actors in PICs currently remains weak, for various reasons. First, social protection&#13;
     requires strong policy coordination and coherence across several sectors to avoid&#13;
     piecemeal and reactive responses, including strengthening ministries that are&#13;
     responsible for a range of benefit programs and services (Parks et al., 2009). Moreover,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              46&#13;
&amp;#12;     as new social protection programs are designed and adapted with disaster response and&#13;
     resilience goals in the PICs, it becomes essential that the relevant agencies establish&#13;
     partnerships with disaster risk management, meteorology and climate change&#13;
     adaptation actors at the national level, especially for coordinating around hazard and risk&#13;
     mapping and early warning systems ahead of disasters, as well as for rapid response&#13;
     when a disaster hits.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    Developing scalable and flexible mechanisms that can quickly react to protect&#13;
     populations during or after a disaster. These mechanisms include targeting, registry, and&#13;
     payment systems that can identify, enroll, and make transfers to additional eligible&#13;
     participants, as well as funding arrangements that can mobilize adequate resources on&#13;
     short notice (See Box 9).&#13;
    Box 9: Scaling-up cash-transfers after disasters&#13;
    Following the January 2011 floods in Brazil, the Bolsa Familia was able to extend in kind&#13;
    and cash benefits to 162,000 affected families in 279 municipalities within 10 days. The&#13;
    rapid response was made possible by using the Bolsa Familia registry (Cadastro Unico) and&#13;
    ID cards to identify and verify the affected families and disbursing payments through&#13;
    program banking arrangements with the Caixa Economica Federal branches.&#13;
    In Pakistan, the Citizen Damage Compensation Program in response to 2011 floods&#13;
    benefitted greatly from the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) which&#13;
    maintains a database of civil registration data of over 96 million citizens in Pakistan and&#13;
    abroad, and also from a database of the beneficiaries of an ongoing national SSN program.&#13;
    The CDCP made use of both of these databases to identify its beneficiary household pool.&#13;
    NADRA also helped CDCP refine its eligibility criteria by triangulating household data with&#13;
    other disaster specific eligibility criteria to verify beneficiary eligibility and produced lists&#13;
    of over 2million beneficiaries. The Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program in the&#13;
    Philippines was utilized to top-up payments to beneficiaries in the areas affected by&#13;
    typhoon Yolanda in November 2013.&#13;

&#13;
Building responsive social protection systems is challenging in countries such as PICs where&#13;
social protection agencies have relatively low capacity and have not yet developed&#13;
technology and systems that allow them to scale up. As these features require capacity to&#13;
quickly adjust benefits and payment systems based on the post-disaster context and needs,&#13;
it is important to plan and enhance capacity and coordination before disaster hits. For this,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 47&#13;
&amp;#12;contingency budgets and plans, emergency response teams, and partnerships with the&#13;
private sector and civil society are vital.&#13;
&#13;
Assessing options for building scalable and responsive programs in some of these countries&#13;
might first require the development of country-specific diagnostics and assessments to&#13;
identify entry points. In particular these diagnostics could look at existing systems, assess&#13;
linkages and capacity and provide suggestions to increase collaboration and reduce&#13;
fragmentation of programs and actors.             17   Specific assessments to identify potential&#13;
mechanisms for the scale up of social protection systems in the face of disasters and shocks&#13;
might also be needed (See Box 10).&#13;
Box 10: Mexico Temporary Employment Program&#13;
The Temporary Employment Program (PET) in Mexico is a cash-for-work program providing&#13;
temporary transfers in exchange for labor in community projects to eligible households in&#13;
marginalized municipalities or whose livelihoods have been affected by natural disasters or&#13;
other crises. PET aims to reach the poor with labor-intensive public work programs that build&#13;
infrastructure as well as environmental or sustainable agricultural improvements.&#13;
Incremental funds are usually made available for additional beneficiaries in places that have&#13;
been affected by systemic shocks such as natural disasters. This way, the PET provides&#13;
resources both for ex-post (disaster recovery/reconstruction) and ex-ante (disaster risk&#13;
reduction) community-based public works. In the last decade, the program has invested&#13;
approximately US$ 420 million in public works projects. Different ministries share&#13;
responsibility for implementation, in accordance with their specializations and comparative&#13;
advantages.&#13;
Some of the types of interventions supported by the public works have a goal to build climate&#13;
resilience, such as building flood channels and reinforced terrace borders to protect against&#13;
rain storms/hurricanes; planting of coastal areas to protect from storm surge/high winds;&#13;
water collection and preservation in arid/drought-prone areas, etc. Disaster preparedness&#13;
and risk reduction information and outreach activities are also carried out.&#13;
In 2003, a subcomponent of the PET was established as the Emergency PET (PETi), and&#13;
assigned the task of emergency response. In 2006, an annual contingency fund became&#13;
mandatory for each agency involved in the implementation of the program (of up to 20&#13;
percent) to be used in case of emergency. PETi is activated when a state of emergency is&#13;
declared with the goal of supporting households that have been affected by a disaster&#13;
through relief and recovery activities, with the goal of providing them with a source of income&#13;
while helping them avoid negative coping strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
  In 2014/15, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s SP&amp;L team (East Asia and Pacific region) has conducted such stocktaking SP/DRM/CCA&#13;
country diagnostics in Vietnam, Philippines, Fiji and Tonga.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    48&#13;
&amp;#12;Once response is approved, the emergency actions are launched, including a damage&#13;
assessment, planning visits to identify potential beneficiaries based on damage, and&#13;
beneficiary selection and enrollment. Social Assistance Teams are mobilized to work together&#13;
with the municipal authorities in identifying and communicating with the affected&#13;
population. The beneficiaries provide labor to community works focused primarily on post-&#13;
disaster clean-up activities (e.g., waste collection and disposal, etc.) and supporting&#13;
temporary shelters and displacement centers.&#13;
The regular PET's beneficiary targeting system uses social marginalization indexes to more&#13;
accurately identify the most vulnerable communities. Municipalities with medium, high or&#13;
very high marginalization levels or high unemployment are selected for operation of regular&#13;
PET. The marginalization index is a composite measure published by CONAPO (National&#13;
Population Commission) that allows classifying municipalities based on their lack of access to&#13;
services, housing conditions, income, and remoteness or size of the locality. Individuals self-&#13;
select themselves into the program. However, preference is given to those individuals who&#13;
have registered in the program through the National Employment Service (SNE).&#13;
In the case of PETi, when an emergency is declared, geographical targeting is the first level of&#13;
beneficiary selection. Participation is mainly limited to households residing in municipalities&#13;
inside the area where the emergency has been declared. Since 2009, housing damage&#13;
surveys have been the mechanism used to identify eligible households within disaster-&#13;
affected communities. The PETi emergency response teams perform a visual assessment of&#13;
household and property damage, and interview the heads of the households that have&#13;
sustained the damage. In addition to targeting based on housing damage, PET also targets&#13;
beneficiaries who cannot return to work due to loss of infrastructure at their workspace, as&#13;
well as loss of their lands/crops. It has been observed that in emergency response, a certain&#13;
amount of exclusion error is more likely, as some households may have sustained damage&#13;
and income losses in municipalities not officially declared under a state of emergency.&#13;
Regular PET uses a standardized and centralized database that allows for the efficient sharing&#13;
of information among the implementing partners. For registration in regular PET, the SNE&#13;
provides information on the availability of employment opportunities in PET projects. Eligible&#13;
individuals can request to participate through the local SNE office.&#13;
In the case of PETi, during the housing damage survey, the PET team provides eligible&#13;
household heads with a receipt or number code which they can use to register at temporary&#13;
registration desks and to claim benefits. Field staff enters the beneficiary data into PETi's&#13;
own registry after each natural disaster. The registry is used for public works follow-up by&#13;
other participating government agencies.&#13;
Regular PET payments are meant to function as a supplementary and temporary income&#13;
support. Generally, the payments cover 10 working days. The wage is set at 99 percent of the&#13;
current minimum wage rate (62 pesos or US$ 4.60 in 2012). This represents 52 percent of the&#13;
poverty line in urban areas, 146 percent in rural areas (national poverty line is individual).&#13;
Beneficiaries can work up to 132 working days per intervention, with the average intervention&#13;
being 76 working days.&#13;
When responding to a disaster, PETi adapts some of these mechanisms to ensure that support&#13;
reaches beneficiaries in a timely and adequate manner. Thus, the limit to the number of days&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;a beneficiary can work is lifted and this limit removal can last as long as the state of&#13;
emergency is in place. Payments are disbursed to beneficiaries within five working days, on&#13;
average, after a disaster has been declared in an area.&#13;

           e. A look at specific social protection instruments and their potential use for&#13;
               DRM/CCA in the Pacific Island Countries&#13;
Experience shows that when disasters hit, usually, existing mechanisms or programs may be&#13;
adapted or expanded to increase speed of response. This approach might be appropriate&#13;
when adequate social protection programs exist, as some of the existing mechanisms can be&#13;
modified or improved in the short term (Parks et al., 2009). For instance, programsâ&#128;&#153; targeting&#13;
mechanisms could be modified through the adoption of simple targeting methods focusing,&#13;
for example, on: (i) geographic characteristics; (ii) housing or livelihoods damage; (iii)&#13;
household/individual vulnerability characteristics such as disability and old age.&#13;
In the case of PICs, most systems and programs for social protection are weak or not yet&#13;
developed. For this reason, in most cases, as new social interventions or schemes are&#13;
developed, they should aim to address the risks and priorities imposed by the extreme&#13;
vulnerability of the region to disasters and climate change.&#13;
The choice of social protection instrument is highly relative and contextual and must be based&#13;
on a careful assessment of the objectives that are to be achieved by the intervention, as well&#13;
as the capacity and resources for implementation. However, based on successful experiences,&#13;
some general lessons can be drawn from the use of different SP instruments for disaster&#13;
response and risk reduction.&#13;
                   i. In-kind vs. cash benefits&#13;
In the past, food aid and other in-kind relief (blankets, emergency kits) have been the main&#13;
form of humanitarian assistance after a natural disaster around the world. Although many&#13;
agencies that have traditionally used this type of assistance are now more widely promoting&#13;
the use of cash-based interventions, food aid continues to be key in many contexts, for&#13;
instance, when markets are disrupted, are not developed or when there is no cash-based&#13;
local economy, such as is the case in many remote island locations in the Pacific. In some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              50&#13;
&amp;#12;cases, when there is high inflation or prices rise quickly after a disaster, locals may prefer food&#13;
or in-kind transfers, as was the case in Ethiopia after the 2011 drought. In-kind transfers are&#13;
also sometimes preferred if there are security constraints or specific gender or malnutrition&#13;
issues that need to be addressed by providing specific interventions such as school-feeding,&#13;
take home rations, etc. In-kind modality is also preferred in the aftermath of natural disasters,&#13;
when markets, especially for food/supplies, do not exist.&#13;
Cash transfers, on the other hand, are versatile instruments that can be used to meet a range&#13;
of needs. For instance, cash transfers have been successfully used to reach populations&#13;
affected by natural disasters in several occasions, such as during the floods in Pakistan in 2011&#13;
or typhoon in Philippines in 2013. In general, cash transfers serve the purpose of getting help&#13;
to the victims of those disasters with the goal of preventing them from falling or sinking&#13;
deeper into poverty (See Box 11).&#13;
  Box 11: Cash transfers in Pakistan&#13;
  In Pakistan, Phase I of the CDCP aimed to provide quick assistance to families who lost their&#13;
  homes or faced a serious threat to their wellbeing as a result of the flood. Eligible&#13;
  households located in the affected areas were given a one-off cash grant in the amount of&#13;
  PRK 20,000 (or approximately US$ 213). This amount was determined based on the funds&#13;
  available to the Government of Pakistan to try to cover the urgent needs of a very large&#13;
  flood-affected target population.&#13;
  The funds helped households to cover needs at a crucial time, with an evaluation of Phase&#13;
  I finding that families had used the grants mostly for food, health needs, housing repair,&#13;
  and debt re-payment (Hunt et al., 2011). However, the amount was insufficient for the&#13;
  flood-affected households to recapitalize their damaged or lost assets, and a decision was&#13;
  taken to implement a second phase of the CDCP in order to support the recovery of&#13;
  affected households.&#13;
  Source: World Bank, 2013a.&#13;
&#13;
Cash transfers are useful to stabilize the situation after a disaster, to protect and replace lost&#13;
income and assets, ensure adequate household nutrition and health care, and keep children&#13;
in school. Cash programs were also found to be 20-50 percent cheaper to administer than&#13;
food or in-kind programs, hinting at their cost-effectiveness (Parks et al., 2009).&#13;
Finally, a few programs have also experimented with transferring productive assets to&#13;
populations that are at risk of natural and climate shocks, especially in those cases where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                51&#13;
&amp;#12;crops and livestock might be affected (droughts, floods, cyclones). Just as with cash transfers,&#13;
this type of productive asset transfer might also help families increase their risk management&#13;
strategies ahead of a disaster, by helping them build an asset base (See Box 12).&#13;
      Box 12: Asset transfers in Bangladesh CLP Program&#13;
      The CLPâ&#128;&#153;s Asset Transfer Project (ATP) is designed to strengthen the income and assets&#13;
      base of its core households, with the longer-term aim of lifting their regular income above&#13;
      the poverty line. The program is comprised of three key elements: the provision of a&#13;
      substantial productive asset; payment of a monthly stipend; and livelihoods-related&#13;
      training.&#13;
      The program provides access to a cash grant for the purchase of productive assets of their&#13;
      choice. The participants are trained in the selection, care and profitable sale of their assets&#13;
      and in reinvestment strategies to accumulate further assets (Marks, 2010). The level of the&#13;
      asset grant is determined based on the market cost of purchasing and maintaining the&#13;
      chosen item at the time of program implementation (Howe 2006) and has averaged&#13;
      between Tk 13,000-17,000 during CLP-1 (Conroy et al, 2010).&#13;
      Source: World Bank, 2013a.&#13;
&#13;
There is some evidence that in PICs the disaster response more often tends to be in-kind, and&#13;
it appears that formal cash transfer mechanisms are very limited and have seldom been used&#13;
for responding to natural disasters. 18 There is also little evidence that the existing&#13;
mechanisms help households create resilience to natural disasters and climate shocks.&#13;
Evidence shows that remittances and other forms of accessing cash are very important in the&#13;
wake of disasters. This clearly points out to the need of providing some type of cash&#13;
interventions, especially in urban areas. As the demand for more formal, cash-based social&#13;
protection increases, PICs governments will need to keep in mind their important role in&#13;
building resilience to natural and climate shocks and for response after a disaster. In each&#13;
case, however, the risks and benefits of an in-cash versus and in-kind benefit will need to be&#13;
assessed and weighed against the particular context.&#13;
&#13;
                       ii. Conditional or Unconditional Cash Transfers&#13;
In general, the use of cash transfers after emergencies has been limited to unconditional&#13;
transfers, since conditions (schooling, health) might be too onerous for affected families&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
     Communication with an expert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  52&#13;
&amp;#12;immediately after a disaster, due to disruptions in services, etc. Even in the case of CCTs, the&#13;
emerging practice (e.g., response to typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines) is to exempt&#13;
households from conditions for a certain period after the disaster. Conditions (e.g., the&#13;
requirement to send children to school, attend health checks or other activities as a condition&#13;
to receive the cash transfer) might be more useful in the recovery phase or later, when there&#13;
is a long-term objective, such as encouraging human capital development after a disaster. In&#13;
these cases, if relevant for the country context and program objectives, conditions might be&#13;
useful to encourage families to put children back into schools and access health care. In any&#13;
case, conditional cash transfers require significant capacity to implement and monitor&#13;
conditionalities as well as having in place adequate service provision for beneficiaries to be&#13;
able to meet those conditionalities. 19 Their benefits and disadvantages will have to be&#13;
weighed against the program objectives.&#13;
It is important to note that besides their role in disaster response, cash transfers can also play&#13;
a role in helping vulnerable populations build resilience to natural disasters and climate&#13;
shocks. Conditional and unconditional cash transfers can help the poor and vulnerable build&#13;
an asset base, invest in human capital and in the long term, diversify livelihoods, access credit,&#13;
etc., which make them more resilient to shocks (See Box 13).&#13;
      Box 13: Bangladesh Chars Livelihoods Project (CLP)&#13;
      Starting from 2007, the CLP, a livelihoods scheme that mostly focused on temporary&#13;
      employment and asset transfers to poor beneficiaries affected by seasonal floods,&#13;
      introduced a cash grant varying from Tk 800 to Tk 2,000 (US $10-25) to those households&#13;
      unable to participate in the employment program (e.g., those headed by disabled people&#13;
      or women without the physical strength to provide labor). A CLP study found that, during&#13;
      the prolonged 2007 lean season, the recipient households took 40 percent less cash loans&#13;
      and significantly less food loans and credit than control households (Conroy et al, 2010).&#13;
      The participation of disabled-, older- and female-headed households grew progressively&#13;
      over CLP intakes (Hodson, 2009), possibly indicating the success of this and other CLP social&#13;
      equality measures.&#13;
      Source: World Bank, 2013a.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19&#13;
     For instance, sending children to school requires that there is actually a school nearby, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          53&#13;
&amp;#12;Although the experience with either conditional or unconditional cash transfers is limited in&#13;
PICs, demand for these types of interventions might increase together with increased&#13;
monetization. There is evidence that cash interventions are needed after natural disasters,&#13;
although this is often currently provided through informal, private remittances.&#13;
                        iii. Public Works Programs&#13;
Public works programs20 (cash or in-kind transfers in exchange for labor on community and&#13;
public assets) have been used with the goal of providing relief, recovery and reconstruction&#13;
after disasters. In addition to reaching individual households in need, public works programs&#13;
(PWPs) also bring additional tangible and immediate benefit to the community and society&#13;
by helping build or rehabilitate infrastructure, assets, or natural resources that are much&#13;
needed. In the aftermath of disasters, public works programs have been used to build or&#13;
restore communal assets, as well as for rubble clearance, marketplace rehabilitation, roads,&#13;
and slope stabilisation.&#13;
Moreover, PWPs have a role to play in preparing and building resilience towards disasters. By&#13;
implementing disaster- and climate- sensitive PWPs before disaster hits, it is possible to&#13;
increase the availability of coping strategies and reduce the risk both at the household and&#13;
the community level; while the cash or in-kind transfer helps individuals increase or maintain&#13;
consumption, the assets created by the intervention may benefit the entire community,&#13;
especially by putting in place assets and measures that help reduce risk from disasters.&#13;
Although the main objective of PWPs is usually to transfer cash or assets to the affected and&#13;
vulnerable population, it is important that the resources allocated to the infrastructure&#13;
portion of the works are used in the most productive way. For that reason, a recent trend in&#13;
public works programs has been to focus the public work activities on small environmental&#13;
conservation and rehabilitation works, soil and water management, etc. (for instance,&#13;
building small irrigation works, planting mangroves for coastal protection). These activities&#13;
are usually small, which allows keeping the transfer to poor households sizable, while the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
     Also called, workfare, temporary employment programs, food for assets, cash for assets, cash for work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        54&#13;
&amp;#12;public works activities help build resilience of the community to environmental and climate&#13;
hazards through the assets created (See Box 14).&#13;
  Box 14: Ethiopia Productive Safety Nets Program&#13;
  The Productive Safety Nets Program in Ethiopia (PSNP) helps address the needs of&#13;
  chronically food insecure households in identified famine-prone areas of rural Ethiopia&#13;
  through:&#13;
  â&#128;¢ The predictable provision of adequate food and cash transfers to targeted beneficiary&#13;
  households, thus allowing effective consumption smoothing and avoiding asset depletion.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ The creation of productive and sustainable community assets that contribute to the&#13;
  rehabilitation of severely degraded areas, build resilience to climate-related impacts, and&#13;
  increase household productivity. The program also contributes to improved access to&#13;
  social services, such as education and health.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ The use of risk financing mechanisms, which allow for the program to be scaled up in&#13;
  times of transitory crisis.&#13;
  The program finances labor-intensive public works, such as building terraced fields on hill&#13;
  slopes to reduce soil erosion and increase water retention, and social services&#13;
  infrastructure. Cash is paid for up to five days of work a month per household member,&#13;
  for six months a year, until the recipient households graduate from the program by&#13;
  accumulating an asset and income level that enables them to meet 12 months of food&#13;
  needs and to withstand modest shocks. In addition, about 20percent of the participating&#13;
  households with members unable to work receive unconditional cash or food transfers&#13;
  (World Bank/United Nations, 2010).&#13;
  Some 60 per cent of the PSNP's public works sub-projects are in soil and water&#13;
  conservation, strengthening both livelihoods and resistance to the impacts of variable&#13;
  rainfall. A 2008 independent Public Works Impact Assessment (M.A Consulting Group,&#13;
  2009) found that:&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Soil and water conservation projects led to significant and visible increases in wood&#13;
  and herbaceous vegetation cover and a broader diversity of plant species, in turn&#13;
  contributing to an increased supply of livestock feed, bee forage, and medicinal plants.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Small-scale irrigation from water sources developed by the PSNP helped 4â&#128;&#147;12 percent&#13;
  of households to expand livestock holdings and to increase incomes by 4â&#128;&#147;25 percent, with&#13;
  even very small irrigated plots (190 m2) estimated to be capable of generating gross&#13;
  margins of between ETB 4,200 to 6,000 per year (US$413-91) if double cropped.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ The construction of water conservation structures has reduced surface runoff,&#13;
  increased infiltration, and raised groundwater levels, thereby enhancing spring yields and&#13;
  increasing stream base-flows with the result that, in several communities, springs now last&#13;
  longer into the dry season. The domestic water supplies have doubled in the sampled&#13;
  communities.&#13;
  The PSNP has dedicated specific resources to ensuring the quality and sustainability of the&#13;
  public works. Woreda, zonal, or regional experts carry out technical supervision, with an&#13;
  overall project supervisor making at least weekly visits to all work sites. A program of skills&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              55&#13;
&amp;#12;     upgrading and training across different technical agencies and levels is provided through&#13;
     the capacity building component of the program. Regional Public Works Focal Units&#13;
     (RPWFU) have been also established in all regions to coordinate the implementation of&#13;
     activities at the regional level and to provide technical support to the woredas (World&#13;
     Bank, 2010).&#13;

Looking at the formal social protection mechanisms, it is clear that PWPs have not been used&#13;
in this fashion in PICs. However, given these countries contexts, there is tremendous potential&#13;
to use PWP as a mechanism to provide cash transfers and employment to poor and&#13;
vulnerable populations, while at the same time helping build or rehabilitate infrastructure,&#13;
assets and resources that help communities increase their resilience. 21 Parks et al. (2009)&#13;
have noted that focusing such programs on young people in the Pacific would be particularly&#13;
valuable given the large numbers of unemployed youth in many Pacific Islands. Gender&#13;
requirements must be included.&#13;
Although PWPs usually require a relatively good level of capacity for implementation, there&#13;
are several experiences (especially in sub-Saharan Africa) where they have been&#13;
implemented through a community-based model. High levels of community engagement&#13;
help transfer some of the needs for capacity to the local communities. Given the strong&#13;
tradition of community participation in PICs, PWPs could be implemented through a&#13;
community-driven delivery mechanism (See Box 15).&#13;
     Box 15: Implementing Public Works Programs through community-based approaches&#13;
     Community participation has many advantages for project implementation as well as for&#13;
     communities themselves:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Since communities have better access to information at the local level, they are better&#13;
     able to select, design, implement, and monitor projects by being close to where the&#13;
     projects are happening.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Community participation might also reduce administrative and coordination costs.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ It allows communities to take ownership of the program.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ It may promote the execution of activities that genuinely respond to the needs of the&#13;
     poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
  The disaster preparedness and response can be potentially incorporated into some of the existing PWPs in&#13;
the Pacific, including Urban Youth Employment Project (UYEP) in PNG, and Rapid Employment Project (REP) in&#13;
Solomon Islands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   56&#13;
&amp;#12;  â&#128;¢ It may contribute to better-quality works and may lead to better maintenance of the&#13;
  assets created.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ It may increase the programâ&#128;&#153;s public accountability and transparency.&#13;
  There are several ways in which communities can be involved in program implementation.&#13;
  They can determine eligibility criteria for beneficiary selection and/or identify&#13;
  beneficiaries, select projects, monitor activities, or even help fund projects. The success of&#13;
  their involvement depends on how their participation is built into program design. The&#13;
  degree of involvement and scope of activities in which communities are involved vary&#13;
  greatly across countries.&#13;
  In Yemenâ&#128;&#153;s Public Works Program, the active participation of poor communities became&#13;
  the cornerstone of the success in delivered services. Their involvement encompassed&#13;
  identifying, prioritizing, and selecting projects according to their needs; providing&#13;
  contributions (in cash or in kind) as a prerequisite to implementation; and implementation,&#13;
  operation, and maintenance of projects. This process increased community awareness of&#13;
  the programâ&#128;&#153;s development aspects and community understanding of implementation&#13;
  issues. Moreover, it promoted a strong sense of ownershipâ&#128;&#148;which was evidenced by&#13;
  community contributions, which reached 11 percent of total project costâ&#128;&#148; and improved&#13;
  community membersâ&#128;&#153; abilities to assume responsibility of completed projects, thus&#13;
  guaranteeing sustainability.&#13;
  In Malawi, project selection within the Social Action Fund Program (MASAF) is, in principle,&#13;
  made at the district level in consultation with traditional leaders using participatory rural&#13;
  appraisal methodologies. Practical application has varied, however, and the evidence&#13;
  shows that those communities that participated in project selection had fewer&#13;
  implementation problems compared with the other communities, which is directly&#13;
  attributable to the procedure used for project selection.&#13;
  In Ethiopia, PSNP project selection is handled at the community level using a planning&#13;
  process based on the concept of community-based participatory watershed development&#13;
  (CBPWD). This approach was developed by the government of Ethiopia in collaboration&#13;
  with the World Food Program and other agencies. It is recognized both nationally and&#13;
  internationally as an appropriate method and serves as the basis for developing a pipeline&#13;
  of projects, many of which have a soil and water conservation focus. A guideline authored&#13;
  by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development provides local government staff and&#13;
  rural communities with a workable and adaptable planning tool.&#13;

&#13;
                  iv. Index-based insurance&#13;
Weather-index insurance is designed to trigger compensation against a weather-related&#13;
shock (flood, drought, etc.) based on a parameter previously defined, i.e. payment is not&#13;
triggered by actual loss, but on the basis of an index, such as rainfall measured at a local&#13;
weather station (WFP, 2010). Although so far most of these initiatives have been small scale,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              57&#13;
&amp;#12;some initial results suggest that this type of interventions might help vulnerable farmers build&#13;
resilience by protecting against shocks, increasing productivity and diversifying livelihoods.&#13;
For instance, Index insurance could help manage catastrophic and highly covariate risks such&#13;
as hurricanes, floods and severe (possibly back-to-back) droughts (protection role). In&#13;
addition, micro-level insurance for poor farmers exposed to climate risk has the potential to&#13;
allow households to increase productivity by encouraging the use of higher-yielding crops, as&#13;
well as asset or livelihood diversification, and to access credit by using the insurance as&#13;
collateral (promotion role).&#13;
The R4 Rural Resilience/HARITA project in Ethiopia provides poor farmers the option to pay&#13;
for insurance by working on public works projects (See Boxes 2 and 4 and Table 2). The&#13;
positive response by cash-poor PSNP beneficiaries to the opportunity to purchase insurance&#13;
with their labor indicates that the demand exists for micro-level disaster insurance by the&#13;
chronically poor, provided it is designed to meet their self-assessed needs and circumstances.&#13;
SP programs can provide an effective, and likely cost-efficient, vehicle to make disaster&#13;
insurance accessible to the chronically poor. The security provided by the insurance,&#13;
combined with regular cash transfers and/or other forms of asset protection against climate-&#13;
related impacts, may further create an enabling environment for prudent risk-taking by poor&#13;
households to increase and diversify their asset/income base (World Bank, 2013a).&#13;
Nevertheless, feasibility of index insurance needs to be carefully considered. Similarly,&#13;
different levels of insurance might work better in different contexts (macro/meso level vs.&#13;
micro level). According to a comprehensive study of weather-index insurance around the&#13;
world (IFAD/WFP, 2010) WII is expensive to launch as it requires significant resources and&#13;
technical expertise to conduct the initial research and development, and, in some cases,&#13;
access data, and build the local market capacity.&#13;
In PICs, insurance could play an important protection and promotion role as part of a&#13;
comprehensive package of integrated social protection tools. It is important, however, that&#13;
the proposition for these countries take into account what might be significant data&#13;
constraints as well as potentially shallow markets. In this cases, a higher level (national or&#13;
meso level) insurance mechanism can serve as a contingency financing mechanism for social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;protection programs. In all cases, it is important to use, when possible, existing, efficient&#13;
delivery channels, such as successful safety nets projects, and to engage the private sector&#13;
from the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;   III. Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
As the risks from natural disasters and climate change continue to grow, it is essential to find&#13;
solutions that can help the poor and vulnerable cope with the impacts and build long term&#13;
resilience. Social protection, with its goals to prevent the poor from falling deeper into&#13;
poverty, protect them against shocks and promote them out of extreme poverty, represents&#13;
a potentially useful mechanism for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation.&#13;
As demonstrated by the examples of Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mexico, and&#13;
Pakistan that have been presented throughout this paper, social protection mechanisms&#13;
might help deal with disaster risk in very diverse contexts and circumstances. Pacific island&#13;
countries (PICs) might be able to extrapolate some of the lessons from these examples.&#13;
&#13;
Although PICsâ&#128;&#153; social, economic and cultural context is unique and varies substantially from&#13;
country to country, they all face similar challenges as they become more integrated in the&#13;
global economy, as well as more exposed to forces that modify their traditional societies.&#13;
PICsâ&#128;&#153; high exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change compound these&#13;
problems. These vulnerabilities not only point out to the need for more comprehensive&#13;
formal social protection systems, but also make it essential that, as SP systems start to&#13;
emerge and evolve, they include disaster and climate risk considerations, in order to provide&#13;
prevention, protection and promotion functions around these risks.&#13;
&#13;
This paper has intended to provide a framework for exploring the potential for social&#13;
protection for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation in the region. Given&#13;
the highly contextual nature of the region, the particularities arising from its location,&#13;
topography and cultural forces, as well as the differences from country to country, the new&#13;
and reformed social protection systems might look somewhat different from other regions in&#13;
the world. In any case, some lessons, principles and pointers presented throughout this paper&#13;
should be useful, while keeping in mind that they need to be extrapolated to the region with&#13;
due caution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              60&#13;
&amp;#12;A climate and disaster responsive social protection system in PICs would need to take into&#13;
account the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Climate- and Disaster-aware Planning, which implies building the necessary&#13;
       contingency, information and targeting mechanisms that allow anticipating, coping&#13;
       with and reducing risk from natural disasters at a system level.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Interventions Centered on Livelihoods and Assets, with the goal of strengthening&#13;
       social, physical and natural household and community assets in a way that increases&#13;
       resilience to shocks; and supporting viable livelihoods for households.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Building Adaptive and Response Capacity at System Level to deal with large systemic&#13;
       shocks, including appropriate institutional capacity and coordination with DRM and&#13;
       climate change agencies and, scalable and flexible mechanisms that can quickly react&#13;
       to protect populations during or after a disaster.&#13;
&#13;
As new social interventions or schemes are developed or expanded in PICs, they should aim&#13;
to address the risks and priorities imposed by the extreme vulnerability of the region to&#13;
disasters and climate change. Nevertheless, the choice of social protection instrument is&#13;
always highly contextual and should be based on a careful assessment of the objectives that&#13;
are to be achieved by the intervention, as well as the capacity and resources for&#13;
implementation. Based on successful experiences, some key considerations that can be&#13;
drawn regarding the use of different SP instruments for disaster response and risk reduction&#13;
include:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Providing in-kind or cash benefits, as appropriate to the context, keeping in mind that&#13;
       although cash provides versatility, in-kind transfers are needed when markets are not&#13;
       developed or destroyed.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Choosing between conditional or unconditional cash transfer based on the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       objective but keeping in mind that conditions might be onerous after a systemic&#13;
       shock.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Considering public works programs in cases where there is also an objective of&#13;
       building or reconstructing assets, while ensuring that public works activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             61&#13;
&amp;#12;       contribute to risk reduction and resilience goals. The public works could serve as a&#13;
       good instrument to enhance the housing and urban development agenda.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Where markets exist, consider index-based insurance combined with regular social&#13;
       protection mechanisms to create an enabling environment for prudent risk-taking by&#13;
       poor households to increase and diversify their asset/income base.&#13;
&#13;
Based on these principles, an overall assessment of the common challenges for disaster risk&#13;
management and social protection in the region points out to several commonalities or&#13;
synergies that could be explored:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   National level policy and planning coordination: In terms of the disaster risk&#13;
       management sector, there is a need to mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate&#13;
       change into national budgets and into sector policies, plans and programs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Data, information and identification of vulnerabilities: There is a need across the&#13;
       region to promote better data collection and its use for guiding disaster and climate&#13;
       risk reduction interventions, but also social protection programs targeting.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Community involvement: Both in the social protection sector and the disaster risk&#13;
       management, there is a need to involve communities in disaster risk reduction and to&#13;
       understand traditional forms of coping (traditional social protection) to design&#13;
       adequate complementary interventions.&#13;
&#13;
The potential entry points for social protection policy makers and practitioners in the region&#13;
to start incorporating features and principles for disaster response and climate resilience are&#13;
presented below.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations for improving Climate- and Disaster-aware Planning:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Establishing partnerships for data and information gathering with relevant agencies.&#13;
       Social protection agencies should establish stronger partnerships with disaster risk&#13;
       management, meteorology and climate change adaptation actors at the national&#13;
       level, especially for coordinating around hazard and risk mapping and early warning&#13;
       systems ahead of disasters, as well as for rapid response when a disaster hits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              62&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Promoting better data collection and use for not only guiding disaster and climate risk&#13;
       reduction interventions, but also targeting social protection programs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Assessing targeting mechanisms to identify potential features that can allow&#13;
       identifying and reaching those with highest climate and natural hazard risk or those&#13;
       affected by a disaster.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Promoting better integration of the SP/DRM/CCA with the urban development&#13;
       agenda, with a focus on exploring what can work in urban areas to support and&#13;
       enhance social protection links to the CCA and DRM agendas;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Developing country-specific diagnostics and assessments to identify entry points&#13;
       where capacity and systems can be enhanced, and identifying potential mechanisms&#13;
       for the scale-up of social protection systems in the face of disasters and shocks.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations for enhancing Interventions Centered on Livelihoods and Assets:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Identifying relevant actors at the local level, while considering traditional coping&#13;
       practices and promoting the use of culturally-appropriate community-based and civil&#13;
       society mechanisms to identify householdsâ&#128;&#153; and community vulnerability to climate&#13;
       shocks and natural disasters and assess the appropriate interventions based on&#13;
       communitiesâ&#128;&#153; inputs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Assessing the relevance of cash-based interventions for social protection and disaster&#13;
       response based on each countryâ&#128;&#153;s context and policy objectives.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Exploring and developing linkages between conditional cash transfers (CCTs) and&#13;
       disaster response; for example, CCTs focusing on nutrition issues could be used as an&#13;
       entry point to build interventions that require household registries with coverage of&#13;
       the population that could represent an adequate base for comprehensive disaster&#13;
       response.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Assessing the potential for public works programs at the country level, both as a&#13;
       mechanism to provide income and employment to vulnerable populations, and a&#13;
       mechanism to build physical assets for climate and disaster risk reduction at the&#13;
       community level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              63&#13;
&amp;#12;Recommendations for building Adaptive and Response Capacity at System Level:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Ensuring coordination between social protection, disaster risk management and&#13;
       environment agencies, including participation in bodies for disaster response&#13;
       coordination as well as mainstreaming of disaster and climate risk relevant principles&#13;
       and features in social protection policies, plans and programs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Finding synergies and collaboration between the disaster risk management, climate&#13;
       change adaptation and social protection sectors to ensure that resources, knowledge&#13;
       and skills are used as efficiently as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The specific actions in each country context should be based on country-specific diagnostics&#13;
(i.e., detailed country case studies similar to those undertaken recently in Fiji and Tonga) and&#13;
emerge, ideally, from a national and local level dialogue on the role of these mechanisms.&#13;
Context-specific social protection instruments/interventions might have an important role&#13;
for disaster response and long-term resilience, and should continue to be explored, both in&#13;
terms of design and implementation arrangements, in more depth.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
The Pacific island countries (PICs) are some of the most exposed to frequent natural disasters&#13;
and climate shocks, and their vulnerability is increasing due to mounting effects of climate&#13;
change as well as demographic and economic forces. Natural disasters hit the poorest hardest&#13;
and have long-term consequences for human development. Social protection programs and&#13;
systems have an important role in helping poor and vulnerable populations cope with the&#13;
impacts of shocks as well as build long-term resilience. This paper discusses the potential role&#13;
of social protection for disaster and climate risk reduction and management in PICs. It presents&#13;
evidence and lessons from other regions, providing examples of tools and entry points for the&#13;
development of climate- and disaster-responsive social protection interventions and context-&#13;
specific recommendations for PICs.&#13;
