PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT PROTECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.           After decades of isolation from the world economy, Russia embarked on a complex&#13;
program of economic reform in early 1992 that focussed primarily on price and trade liberalization and&#13;
massive privatization of state-owned assets. By end-1994, the Government introduced a second stage of&#13;
reforms that is designed to stabilize prices and deepen institutional changes in the economy. The success&#13;
of this program will depend on implementation of an austere anti-inflation program and a marked&#13;
improvement in the efficiency of investments. Externally-financed projects that advance the reform&#13;
program, reduce the financing gap and demonstrate improvements in the efficiency of public investments&#13;
will contribute significantly to this effort. The identification and preparation of such projects entails&#13;
considerable up-front investments for any borrower. For Russia, this task is even more demanding in&#13;
view of the size and diversity of the country, its evolving economic and institutional setting, and the lack&#13;
of in-depth analyses and policy frameworks in many sectors. Project identification is complicated further&#13;
by the lack of institutional capacity to evaluate relative priorities and to match them with appropriate&#13;
external financing.&#13;
2.           Russia has attracted considerable external resources since 1991, primarily in the form of&#13;
grant technical assistance and trade credits. Experience to date with large externally-financed investment&#13;
projects has been limited. The Bank is presently the largest source of external finance for public&#13;
investment. However, implementation of the $3 billion of approved operations is beginning slowly. The&#13;
Government recognizes that its ability to use external resources effectively has been hampered by the lack&#13;
of institutional capacity at all stages of the project cycle. It has also been aware that the complexity and&#13;
magnitude of its borrowing program from the Bank will require considerably more resources to develop&#13;
and prepare than can be expected from grant or PPF resources.&#13;
3.           The Government discussed the concept of a portfolio development project with the Bank&#13;
during the 1992 Annual Meetings. It was to be implemented by the Russian Agency for International&#13;
Cooperation and Development (RAICD), which had been established by Presidential decree in August&#13;
1992. The initial concept was for RAICD to play a highly centralized role in managing all forms of&#13;
external assistance from all sources. In fact, this role never materialized. RAICD ultimately acquired&#13;
responsibility only for humanitarian and technical assistance. Although partial coordination was provided&#13;
by the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Interaction with International Financial Institutions&#13;
(DIFI) in the Prime Minister's Administration (the Apparat), specialized institutional support for&#13;
development and implementation of major investment projects was never identified. This was rectified&#13;
with the establishment of the Federal Center for Project Finance and Technical Assistance in April 1994&#13;
and by the abolition of RAICD. During the First Annual Country Portfolio Performance Review, held&#13;
in September 1994, the Bank and Government agreed that the proposed operation should be revived and&#13;
used both to strengthen the Center and to finance preparation of the expanded Bank program. Early in&#13;
October, the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Management officially requested that the loan be&#13;
processed on an acoelerated schedule.&#13;

Pare 2                                                            Portfolio Development Proiect&#13;
B. INSIITITIONAL SETTING&#13;
4.           Until recently, the environment for collaboration with international financial institutions&#13;
has been unsettled. First, the role of key core ministries in public investment decisions is undergoing&#13;
significant redefinition. In particular, the Ministry of Finance is becoming stronger while the Ministry&#13;
of Economy (the former Gosplan) is limiting its involvement to federally-financed investments. At the&#13;
same time, sector ministries traditionally lacked a policy voice. Now, they are gradually moving away&#13;
from direct involvement in project execution to a greater policy formulation and monitoring role.&#13;
5.           More importantly, power is both highly centralized and diffused in the Russian&#13;
Government. Authority is shared among the several Deputy Prime Ministers and above. Ministries&#13;
typically fall "below the line' of decision-making power, including the Ministries of Finance and&#13;
Economy. Although this may change gradually, it has been necessary for the Bank to receive clearance&#13;
from very senior levels of Government before proceeding with many tasks, both important and routine.&#13;
A special layer of Government administration, known in Russian as the Apparat, assists by processing&#13;
these decision memoranda. Nevertheless, the Apparat does not have the authority to resolve critical&#13;
differences among ministries, which has delayed implementation of many Bank projects.&#13;
6.           Therefore, despite the high degree of centralization of power, there has been no logical&#13;
power center that could function with authority as the Bank's working-level counterpart. This has been&#13;
complicated by frequent turnover in the talented Government officials who were assigned to the Bank's&#13;
portfolio. This has slowed project processing and the build-up of institutional knowledge on the practices&#13;
and procedures of the Bank as well as other external sources of finance.&#13;
7.           The proposed project will help clarify and strengthen the institutional framework for&#13;
relations with external financing agencies. The project is based on new coordination and loan processing&#13;
arrangements agreed in substance among all key government actors and with the Bank at negotiations.&#13;
These give a clear role at each step of the project cycle to the Project Center, the Ministries of Finance&#13;
and Economy, and the Apparat. A summary of these roles is in Appendix IV. A senior-level&#13;
Interministerial Commission for International Economic Relations, established by the Russian Government&#13;
after the CPPR meeting in September 1994, would provide the framework both for this project and the&#13;
collaboration arrangements with the Bank. Its members are key Deputy Prime Ministers, the Chairman&#13;
of the Central Bank, and the Ministers of Finance and Economy. The Commission, to be chaired by the&#13;
First Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Management, will agree on a medium-term borrowing strategy&#13;
for financing by external agencies. For the Bank, this discussion will take place initially during the CAS&#13;
and at regular intervals thereafter. In the interim, policy advice on Government investment priorities&#13;
would be provided to the Bank by a Working Group comprised of mid-level Government managers (from&#13;
the Ministries of Finance, Economy, the Apparat, the Project Center and the Central Bank). Based on&#13;
documentation prepared by the Project Center in consultation with the Working Group, the&#13;
lnterministerial Commission would decide on Bank projects to be funded with resources from the&#13;
proposed loan.&#13;
8.           The key to the successful functioning of these arrangements is: 1) a consensus-style of&#13;
decision-making; and 2) the establishment of a new institution, the Federal Center for Project Finance&#13;
and Technical Assistance.&#13;
9.           The Federal Centerfor Prujed ffnance and Technical Assiftance. The Bank agrees with&#13;
the Government's view that establishment of a new institution is desirable to fill a void in existing&#13;
governmental structures and to build an institutional store of knowledge on the practices and procedures&#13;
&#13;

of external resource institutions. The Center was established in April 1994 by Government ordinance&#13;
as a governmental body but with independent legal status. The Prime Minister appoints the Center's&#13;
Chairman, who reports to the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Management. The First Deputy&#13;
Prime Minister is also the Chairman of the Interministerial Commission that approves the external&#13;
borrowing program of the Government, including from the Bank. Key management positions in the&#13;
Center have been filled and staff recruitment, presently underway, is expected to reach 226 positions over&#13;
time, of which 146 would be professional. Presently, a total of 60 professional and support staff are in&#13;
place. The Center is organized into six departments, including Technical Assistance, Project Finance,&#13;
the Business Opportunities Bureau, Information Services, Finance and Administration. Staff from the&#13;
technical assistance advisory unit of the European Union, formerly with RAICD, are included in the&#13;
Technical Assistance Department. The regulations, organizational chart and reporting lines, estimated&#13;
staffing plan and draft 1995 budget of the Center are in Appendices VI-IX. Its role and responsibilities&#13;
have been designed with the experience of the RAICD in mind. It will have three primary functions:&#13;
coordination, information dissemination, and advisory services.  Specifically, it will: a) match&#13;
Government investment priorities with official external financing sources and support the identification&#13;
and preparation of externally-assisted projects; b) advise and assist sectoral ministries and implementing&#13;
agencies on the practices and procedures of external financing sources and monitor project&#13;
implementation; and c) support the development of the local consulting industry and advise Russian&#13;
businesses on procurement opportunities in externally-financed projects.&#13;
10.          The proposed coordination and loan processing arrangements will facilitate the&#13;
Government's ability to carry out and coordinate externally-financed projects. They will also help resolve&#13;
many of the institutional issues discussed above that have retarded processing and implementation of Bank&#13;
projects. However, experience with Bank lending is limited in Russia, so the arrangements will evolve&#13;
as the program develops. At negotiations, it was agreed that they would be reviewed and further refined&#13;
during the forthcoming CPPR in September 1995. Initially, delays can be expected throughout the project&#13;
cycle. Over time, however, the new arrangements will contribute to strengthening Russian ownership&#13;
of its borrowing program.&#13;
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
11.          There are three principal project objectives. The first is to provide an assured and&#13;
flexible source of funding for preparation of high-priority projects expected to be financed by the Bank.&#13;
The second is to strengthen the institutions involved in coordinating and implementing externally-financed&#13;
projects, particularly in the areas of project management, procurement, disbursement and project-level&#13;
accounting and auditing. This will also aid the implementation of the Bank's present projects and future&#13;
pipeline. The third is to develop the local consulting industry and contribute to greater participation by&#13;
Russian enterprises in competitive bidding on externally-financed projects.&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
12.          There are three related project components:  a) a Fund for Project Preparation; b)&#13;
technical assistance to strengthen external resource coordination and management; and c) establishment&#13;
of a Business Opportunities Bureau in the Center.&#13;
13.          Fund for Project Preparation. The fund would be used to prepare projects and related&#13;
project activities for which Bank financing has been or is expected to be requested during the next three&#13;
fiscal years (see Appendix I). Based on the Government's broad priorities for the FY96-98 lending&#13;
program, approximately US$25 million will be required in addition to grant financing and PPFs to&#13;
support the project pipeline for the next three years. In order to be eligible for financing under this&#13;
&#13;

component, a subproject must be mutually agreed to be of high priority in the Government's development&#13;
efforts. Individual subprojects are not expected to exceed US$3 million. They would finance the cost&#13;
of sector and feasibility studies, project design work and other project preparation activities. A limited&#13;
amount of resources (under US$2 million) would be available to support operational start-up costs in&#13;
PPIUs, such as fax machines. In addition, a small allocation is available (US$1.5 million) for pilbt&#13;
activities related to the preparation of projects.&#13;
14.          The Center would be responsible for identifying the most appropriate source of financing&#13;
(e.g. grants or loans from various bilateral and multilateral sources as well as local resources) for&#13;
activities proposed for this purpose, taking into account the suitability and ready availability of the&#13;
resources. In appropriate cases, a mix of grant and loan funds may be recommended, provided that such&#13;
arrangements would not unduly delay the schedule of activities.&#13;
15.          Technical Assistance to Strengthen External Resource Management. The Center was&#13;
established in April 1994 and is still being staffed. In addition, while institutional roles have been&#13;
designated under the collaboration arrangements, experience is likely to result in revisions over time.&#13;
Consequently, the scope of this component has been designed flexibly to respond to evolving needs.&#13;
Initial activities have been tentatively identified that will strengthen capacity in three parts of Government:&#13;
the Center, core ministries, and sector ministries and implementing agencies. These are identified in more&#13;
detail in Appendix II, Key Project Activities. In summary, they include, inter i:&#13;
1) consultant services, training, equipment, management information systems and&#13;
possibly, study tours, to strengthen the Center's capacity to coordinate, evaluate and monitor externally-&#13;
financed projects as well as to provide advisory services to Russian consultants and businesses;&#13;
2) consultant services, equipment, training and possibly, study tours, to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of core ministries in external resource management. This is likely to include equipment and&#13;
advisory services for the Ministry of Finance to complete work already initiated on a debt management&#13;
system, as well as support for the development of procedures and a regulatory framework to introduce&#13;
competitive public procurement practices; and&#13;
3) consultant services, training and possibly, study tours, to increase the capacity of&#13;
PPIUs in critical project-related activities, including project management, procurement and accounting&#13;
and auditing.&#13;
16.          Establishment of a Business Opportunities Bureau in the Project Center. The activities&#13;
of the Business Opportunities Bureau are described in Appendix X. Its primary purpose is to advise&#13;
potential exporters and firms on the opportunities and requirements for competing for externally-financed&#13;
contracts. The Bureau would develop and manage a data base on firms and enterprises with a potential&#13;
interest in bidding. These would be matched with information from the Bank's Public Information&#13;
Documents (PIDs) and International Business Opportunities Services (IBOS). Using this research, the&#13;
Bureau would target audiences for its business outreach programs, to include business opportunities&#13;
seminars and information and marketing programs. A dissemination mechanism would be established&#13;
to reach key audiences with information bulletins efficiently, such as through banks specializing in trade&#13;
finance for exporters. In addition, business opportunities seminars would be held in key regional&#13;
commercial centers. Two such seminars have already been sponsored by the Center, in Moscow and St.&#13;
Petersburg. They were successful in apprising businesses and associations of opportunities to bid on Bank&#13;
projects, but also revealed a significant need for in-depth follow-up. Consequently, the Bureau would&#13;
contract out training programs on Bank procurement for Russian enterprises and consulting firms that&#13;
show strong interest in participating in competitive bids. The loan would finance consultant services to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

develop the data base, an information and marketing strategy, and appropriate publications. Support&#13;
would also be provided for training programs. Finally, the loan would finance refurbishment of the&#13;
Bureau's premises to make it more amenable as a location for business seminars.&#13;
E. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
17.          The proposed project would cover a three-year commitment period, from FY96 to the&#13;
end of FY98. The total project cost is estimated to be $79.5 million, excluding taxes and duties, with&#13;
a foreign exchange cost of $30 million. It is estimated that about 75% of the loan would finance&#13;
consultant services, study tours and other training, 15% would finance equipment and 10% would finance&#13;
civil works. The proposed loan would finance the entire foreign exchange costs plus some local costs&#13;
for civil works (rehabilitation of Center facilities) and design institutes or consulting firms selected&#13;
according to Bank guidelines. The Bank is financing local expenditures in view of the expected increase&#13;
in capacity of local consultants to bid successfully on project preparation and other activities, which is&#13;
a primary development objective of the project. The local cost contribution from the Russian Government&#13;
would include support for refurbishment of the premises occupied by the Center (US$7.2 million), office&#13;
supplies and equipment (US$2.7 million), counterpart personnel and operating costs of the Center and&#13;
line ministries (US$26.6 million) and local consulting firms under the Fund for Project Preparation (US$3&#13;
million). Government contributions are summarized in the draft 1995 budget attached at Appendix IX.&#13;
No allowance has been made for physical and price contingencies as the project is essentially a line of&#13;
credit to finance project preparation activities for which the specific requirements are not known&#13;
precisely. At negotiations, the Bank agreed to the Government's request to reduce the loan amount from&#13;
US$45 million to US$40 million to avoid the payment of unnecessary commitment charges on&#13;
undisbursed loan preparation funds. However, a follow-up project could be prepared if the loan disburses&#13;
faster than expected. Below is a summary of project costs and the financing plan.&#13;

18.          UNDP normally would be a source of grant financing for many of these activities.&#13;
However, the organization has limited resources and has assigned these largely to former Soviet republics&#13;
with low per capita GDP. Assistance is nevertheless expected through the Support Implementation Group&#13;
of the G-7 and the OECD, principally on a management information system, including for technical&#13;
assistance coordination. In addition, the EU may provide expert services to the Center for its operations.&#13;
19.          Fund for Project Prenaration. The loan amount for the Fund for Project Preparation&#13;
(US$25 million) is based on an estimate of what would be needed to prepare the FY96-98 pipeline beyond&#13;
what is available from other sources. Cost estimates for project preparation are based on experience&#13;
during the past two years in Russia. The initial outlay of resources needed to prepare the project pipeline&#13;
in Russia has been comparatively high in view of the size of the country and the need for greater sector&#13;
knowledge and experience. A large share of these costs were defrayed over the past two years by grant&#13;
financing from bilateral and multilateral agencies. This is expected to decline significantly over the next&#13;
few years. While contributing importantly to project preparation needs, these funds will be insufficient&#13;
to prepare the Government's large and rapidly expanding borrowing program. Moreover, the ready&#13;
availability of flexible resources from the FPP will enable the Government to prepare investment projects&#13;
&#13;

be used innovatively to experiment with pilot activities during the project preparation period, enabling&#13;
adjustments in project design prior to implementation. However, should grant financing materialize that&#13;
is both suitable and readily available for project preparation above that already estimated, or if costs are&#13;
less than expected, the freed resources would be reallocated to finance the initial requirements of projects&#13;
programmed for FY99.&#13;
20.          Technical Assistance to Strengthen External Resource Management. The loan amount&#13;
for the component to strengthen external resource management (US$7 million) is based on the estimated&#13;
costs for the following subprojects, which were agreed at negotiations. The subproject to build capacity&#13;
in the Center (total US$4.0 million) would include: a) a management information system with supporting&#13;
software (US$1.5 million); b) office and communications equipment (US$S1.0 million); c) expert services&#13;
to the Center on management, procurement, accounting and auditing, disbursement, aid coordination,&#13;
quality control, and engineering (US$1.5 million). The subproject to build capacity in sector ministries&#13;
and implementing agencies (total US$1 million) is primarily for training programs and a limited amount&#13;
of consulting services on project-related activities, principally procurement, accounting and auditing, and&#13;
project management. The subproject to strengthen the external resource management capacity of core&#13;
agencies has been allocated US$2 million, part of which would support the strengthening of a debt&#13;
management system for the Ministry of Finance. Other subprojects will support high-priority institution-&#13;
building subprojects that will arise as Russia's external resource management arrangements develop&#13;
further. These are likely to include: (a) consulting services to develop procedures and a regulatory&#13;
framework for the introduction of competitive bidding practices for public procurement; and (b) training&#13;
to improve public investment programming, particularly at regional levels.&#13;
21.           Establishment of a Business Opportunities Bureau. For the establishment of the Business&#13;
Opportunities Bureau, US$7.5 million has been allocated to support the following subprojects, which were&#13;
agreed at negotiations: a) the refurbishment of Center premises which will house the Bureau (US$3.5&#13;
million); b) development of a data base on businesses and enterprises with a potential interest in bidding&#13;
on externally-financed projects (US$1 million); c) business outreach programs, including appropriate&#13;
information and marketing programs (US$1.5 million); and e) training programs on Bank procurement&#13;
for interested Russian enterprises and consulting firms (US$1.5 million).&#13;
22.           Advance from the Proiect Preparation Facility. The Government requested and has&#13;
received an advance from the Project Preparation Facility of US$500,000. It is financing consultant&#13;
services (US$400,000) and equipment (US$100,000) to accelerate project start-up activities in the Center&#13;
and Business Bureau. At negotiations, it was agreed that the following activities were of highest near-&#13;
term priority, for which terms of reference and procurement documentation are being prepared under the&#13;
PPF: a) expert services to the Center in the areas of procurement, disbursement, accounting/auditing and&#13;
staff planning and development; b) refurbishment of Bureau premises; and c) acquisition of office&#13;
equipment for the Center.&#13;
23.           Repayment of Loan Proceeds. During negotiations, the Bank noted that while it was a&#13;
purely internal matter, the Government may wish to develop repayment procedures pertaining to proceeds&#13;
from the loan to create a pool of funds that could be used to finance the preparation of additional&#13;
investment projects. The Government noted that it intends to ask FPP beneficiaries (predominantly&#13;
Government entities) to refinance the preparation funds advanced under the Portfolio Loan from the&#13;
proceeds of loans that would result from Bank-financed projects. In this manner, the FPP would function&#13;
and be refinanced much like advances from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;

F. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Management and Organization&#13;
24.          The Center would be responsible for overall project coordination and for the collection,&#13;
review and evaluation of information regarding project implementation. The sectoral ministries would&#13;
be responsible for monitoring the progress of project preparation of sub-projects and would handle all&#13;
technical aspects, including the procurement of consultants and equipment and the arrangement of study&#13;
tours and training. At negotiations, the Project Implementation Arrangements in Appendix III were&#13;
confirmed.&#13;
25.          The first component (Fund for Project Preparation) would be managed principally by the&#13;
Center in collaboration with other key ministries, particularly the Ministry of Finance. Subproject&#13;
proposals under the Fund for Project Preparation must be consistent with the agreed CAS between the&#13;
Government and the Bank, as revised at regular intervals. Specific subproject proposals would emerge&#13;
from discussions with line ministry staff during Bank sector and/or project identification missions. The&#13;
relevant sectoral ministry would then prepare a request for project preparation funds and forward it to&#13;
the Center for review. The request would include a description of the proposed studies to be financed,&#13;
the proposed selection procedures for any consultants to be engaged, estimated costs, and other&#13;
operational details (similar to a PPF request). The Center would prepare documentation on the proposals&#13;
on a regular basis and submit them, with a recommendation on the use of FPP funds, to the&#13;
Interministerial Commission for decision. Once approved, they would be forwarded to the Bank for&#13;
approval, which would be confirmed by telex. The Center would provide administrative assistance when&#13;
needed to the sectoral ministries and would maintain records on the status of each sub-project,&#13;
documenting the elapsed time between various steps in sub-project processing and the contracting of&#13;
consultants. It would also facilitate disbursements by transferring funds from the Special Account to&#13;
project accounts, from which payments could be made directly to contractors. This arrangement will help&#13;
develop skills in PPIUs while assuring prudent oversight of loan proceeds.&#13;
26.           The second component (technical assistance to strengthen external resource management)&#13;
would be managed by the Center, except for subprojects to support core ministries, which would be&#13;
managed by those ministries. The initial list of subprojects under the second component was agreed at&#13;
negotiations. The funds would be allocated over the next two years, to permit some flexibility as external&#13;
resource management practices develop further in Government. Proposals to be funded under this&#13;
component that are not already identified would generally come from core ministries or the Center itself.&#13;
All subproject proposals would be developed in detail, including the same information as required in FPP&#13;
applications, and submitted by the Center to the Bank for approval on a case-by-case basis before the&#13;
activities are funded from the loan.&#13;
27.          The third component (establishment of Business Opportunities Bureau) would be managed&#13;
entirely by the Center. The Bureau would be headed by a Director within the Center. The Bureau's&#13;
primary purpose is to advise enterprises, manufacturers and consultants on the opportunities and&#13;
requirements for participating in competitive bidding. It would advertise tenders to targeted audiences&#13;
on externally-financed projects to Russian consulting firms and enterprises, conduct business&#13;
opportunities' seminars in Moscow and regional economic centers, and assist interested suppliers and&#13;
contractors with bid preparation through training programs. The terms of reference for Bureau activities&#13;
(Appendix X) and subprojects to be undertaken by the Bureau were confirmed at negotiations. As with&#13;
all other subprojects, these must be developed in detail and submitted to the Bank for approval on a case-&#13;
by-case basis before the activities are funded from the loan.&#13;

Expert Servces to the Center&#13;
28.          Over time, the Center will acquire the capacity to support the identification, preparation,&#13;
implementation and evaluation of externally-assisted projects. The proposed project will help accelerate&#13;
this process by financing expert advisory services to the Center. The Center will require expert assistance&#13;
over the next two-three years to build capacity, particularly in project management, procurement,&#13;
disbursement and project-level accounting and auditing. To a certain degree, this can be acquired through&#13;
training courses offered by EDI and the Joint Vienna Institute Program, or financed by the UK Know-&#13;
How Fund in procurement. In addition, Center staff would be invited to participate in Bank appraisals&#13;
to acquire on-the-job experience. The human resource development needs of Center staff, including&#13;
training and expert advisory services, will be evaluated with resources from the PPF. These steps are&#13;
summarized in Key Project Activities (Appendix II) and the Implementation Plan (XIII).&#13;
29.           For more in-depth training and assistance during project implementation, the TA&#13;
component will include financing for six staff-years of resident advisors (US$1.5 million), who would&#13;
support the Center for short or longer periods of up to two years. The advisors may, inter A: a)&#13;
provide advice on project analysis and evaluation; b) advise on development of appropriate procurement&#13;
plans for externally-financed projects; c) help develop appropriate procedures to monitor disbursements&#13;
or for selection of project auditors; and d) assist in providing advice to PPIUs on procurement,&#13;
disbursement and project-level accounting. The functions and estimated cost of these advisors are&#13;
summarized in Appendices XI and XII. The procurement of the experts would be done following&#13;
Bank/IDA "Guidelines for Selection of Consultants." The terms of reference and letter of invitation,&#13;
including the criteria for evaluating proposals, would be submitted to the Bank prior to Board&#13;
presentation.&#13;
Implementation Status&#13;
30.           The successful implementation of the proposed project depends primarily on the broader&#13;
dialogue on coordination and implementation arrangements between the Bank and Government. These&#13;
matters were the subject of the first CPPR in September 1994. The Agreed Action Plan to Improve&#13;
Implementation, adopted by the CPPR, is in Appendix V to the Technical Annex. All of the short-term&#13;
actions have been completed on time. The most important of these was the drafting of coordination and&#13;
loan processing arrangements, which were discussed and accepted by both sides during negotiations on&#13;
the proposed loan and attached to the minutes of negotiations. The first medium-term action will be for&#13;
the Government's Interministerial Commission for International Economic Relations to review the Bank's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in April 1995. The Project Center's first responsibility is to play a&#13;
key role in the preparation of the documentation for the Commission's discussions. With the assistance&#13;
of the key core ministries, it will review and make recommendations on the Bank's three-year lending&#13;
program in light of Government development objectives and investment priorities. The outcome of the&#13;
CAS discussions will lay the basis for implementation of the proposed loan beginning around April 1995.&#13;
The Project Center as presently staffed is capable of carrying out this responsibility as well as those&#13;
relating to the initial applications for FPP funds. Actual implementation of these subprojects would be&#13;
the responsibility of the technical ministries. Activities under the Fund for Project Preparation are&#13;
sufficiently independent of those under the component to strengthen the Project Center that both can be&#13;
implemented in parallel fashion. However, the Center intends to act quickly to strengthen its ability to&#13;
advise and assist technical ministries during the project cycle and to intiate operations of the Business&#13;
Opportunities Bureau. During negotiations, the Russian Delegation agreed that the highest priorities for&#13;
near-term action were: a) procurement of expert services to the Center in the areas of procurement,&#13;
disbursement, accounting/auditing and staff planning and development; b) refurbishment of the premises&#13;
of the Business Opportunities Bureau; and c) acquisition of additional office equipment for the Center.&#13;

Procurement Aragements&#13;
31.          Procurement under this project would be the responsibility of the Project Finance&#13;
Department of the Center. A procurement supervisor would be hired by the Department to develop and&#13;
administer its procurement operations. He/she would be familiar with World Bank and other donors'&#13;
rules and procurement guidelines. General training on procedures and contract administration would be&#13;
provided for other Department members and those in the Contract Division to support procurement of&#13;
computer equipment, systems and communications software, civil works, consulting services and other&#13;
technical assistance. The Department staff would implement the World Bank's standard bidding and&#13;
procurement documentation for goods, works and services, with needed addenda or supplements, as&#13;
approved by the Bank. The procurement supervisor would ensure that the Center conducts solicitations,&#13;
bid evaluations, contract award processes and procurement reporting as required by the Bank. Terms&#13;
of reference; prequalified vendor and consultant short lists; and bidding, evaluation and contract&#13;
documentation would be routed to the Bank, as appropriate, for needed reviews and no-objections. The&#13;
Center would include information on its procurement activities in periodic reports to the IMF/World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
32.          Annex XV (Procurement Plan) summarizes project elements, their approximate funding&#13;
requirements and the methodology envisioned for the procurement of each category of inputs.  As&#13;
outlined in the following paragraphs, procurement would be implemented in accordance with relevant&#13;
World Bank Guidelines and standard bidding documents and contracts, as appropriate. General guidance&#13;
on procurement policies and procedures would also be available from IBRD staff. The following table&#13;
summarizes the proposed procurement arrangements.&#13;

a.           Technical Assistance.  The Fund for Project Preparation is expected to finance up to&#13;
US$21.5 million of consultancies for technical, sector and feasibility studies related to preparation of&#13;
Bank projects. A total of US$4.0 million in consultant services, including US$0.5 million funded under&#13;
the PPF, is allocated for bank-financed procurement of professional and technical services to assist in&#13;
capacity-building in the Center and core and implementing ministries.  These will largely be expert&#13;
services, some of which may be expatriate, in the fields of procurement, disbursement, accounting,&#13;
auditing and project management. In addition, it is estimated that up to US$1.5 million will be required&#13;
for consulting services relating to business outreach and US$1.5 million for training programs under the&#13;
Business Opportunities Bureau. The program is expected to need technical expertise to provide direct&#13;
assistance to potential bidders as well as for the design and implementation of training materials, public&#13;
information brochures and marketing programs. There may also be a need for expert assistance in&#13;
designing effective business opportunities seminars. The use of local consulting firms and personnel&#13;
would be encouraged to develop the domestic consulting industry. Bank-financed consulting services&#13;
would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency, published in August, 1981. The Bank's standard&#13;
bidding and contract documentation would be used. Solicitation methods and Terms of Reference for all&#13;
consultant assignments, and all procurement documentation and contracts with consulting firms valued&#13;
at greater than US$100,000 would be subject to prior Bank review and approval. Prior Bank review&#13;
and approval would also be required for short lists and contracts with individuals that are expected to&#13;
exceed US$50,000 each. The number of technical assistance and consulting contracts with firms and/or&#13;
individuals and their approximate values is presently being estimated.  Where practicable, technical&#13;
assistance, such as systems installation and/or maintenance services would be sought in contracting&#13;
packages to improve accountability and reduce costs and administrative burdens.&#13;
b.           ICB Procurement.  International Competitive Bidding (ICB) purchases would be&#13;
conducted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.&#13;
ICB procedures would be used for all computer systems and equipment purchases expected to exceed&#13;
US$300,000 per contract. Of the total of approximately US$6.5 million allocated for the purchase of&#13;
information technology, supporting equipment, other office equipment and related furnishings, US$2.0&#13;
million or about 30 percent would be procured using ICB procedures. Principal categories for ICB&#13;
procurement are personal computers, printers, and related networking and systems equipment. In the&#13;
comparison of bids for equipment purchased under ICB, Russian manufacturers would be allowed a&#13;
preferential margin of fifteen percent or the existing customs duty that a nonexempt importer would have&#13;
to pay, whichever is lower, over the competing price of imports, providing domestic value-added is at&#13;
least twenty percent. The number and expected value of ICB contracts is expected to be relatively low&#13;
since the equipment to be procured under the loan is limited and the cost of most individual items is&#13;
expected to be small. The Bank would review and clear ICB procedures, bidding documents, evaluations&#13;
and resulting contracts on an ex-ante basis; and otherwise review and provide "No-Objections", as&#13;
provided for in the Guidelines. Standard Bank IT documentation and bidding procedures would be used&#13;
for these procurements.&#13;
c.           Direct Contracting/Intemnational Shopping. Direct Contracting (DC), as outlined in the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines, may be employed in the procurement of some proprietary computer network upgrades&#13;
and software. Spare parts for equipment and netware elements may also be appropriate for DC&#13;
purchases. Such procurements would be justified and procedures, documentation and prices reviewed&#13;
and cleared beforehand by the Bank. It is expected that Direct Contracting would involve less than&#13;
US$250,000 each in two separate contracting actions. As required by the Guidelines, all Direct&#13;
Contracting documentation, awards and contracting actions would be subject to prior Bank review and&#13;
clearance. International Shopping (IS) may be authorized for readily available, off-the-shelf purchases&#13;
under US$300,000 per contract. International Shopping would be based on quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers, from at least three different eligible countries, as indicated in the Guidelines. The first two&#13;

Russia: Portfolio Develonment Proiect                                              Pae 13&#13;
IS actions would be subject to Bank prior review. All others would be conducted on an ex-post basis&#13;
during supervision missions or procurement reviews. Total IS purchases would not exceed US$3.5&#13;
million and are expected to be primarily for office equipment.&#13;
d.           Local Competitive Bidding. Because they would not be attractive to foreign suppliers,&#13;
civil works procurements would be carried out using Local Competitive Bidding (LCB), as provided for&#13;
in the Bank's Guidelines. Local competitive bidding procedures would be established by the Center and&#13;
submitted to the Bank for review. The total value of LCB actions on works are not expected to exceed&#13;
US$4.2 million. The number of actions in each category are under review. The first two LCB actions&#13;
would be subject to Bank prior review. The remainder would be subject to ex-post Bank review during&#13;
supervision missions or during procurement reviews. As the Bank's Country Procurement Assessment&#13;
Report has not yet been completed for Russia and the Borrower's local competitive bidding process has&#13;
not been approved by the Bank, the Center's LCB procedures and proposed documentation would be&#13;
cleared in advance by the Bank to ensure such purchases would be carried out in a manner consistent with&#13;
relevant sections of the Guidelines.&#13;
e.           Local Shopping. To support the establishment of the Business Opportunities Bureau and&#13;
the rapid build-up of operational capacity in the Center, it is expected that the Center would need to&#13;
initiate a few small value purchases using Local Shopping (LS) techniques described in the Guidelines.&#13;
LS purchases would complement Center-financed office upgrades and are expected to cover contracts&#13;
under US$50,000 each. These purchases, estimated at US$0.5 million, would be used for small value&#13;
transactions for simple works (cabling, etc.) and readily available, off-the-shelf items, such as fax&#13;
machines or small office furnishings. In addition, a small amount of local shopping is expected to be&#13;
used for small maintenance contracts and purchases for small repairs (such as window replacements and&#13;
insulation), both for the refurbishment of the Business Bureau (US$0.3 million) and for pilot rehabilitation&#13;
subprojects financed under the Fund for Project Preparation. (US$0.5 million). Local Shopping would&#13;
be carried out by obtaining at least three price quotations from different eligible suppliers. The first two&#13;
LS actions would be subject to Bank prior review. The other small value LS purchases would be subject&#13;
to ex-post documentation reviews, with payments probably being effected by Special Account and&#13;

f.           Bank procurement supervision. In summary, ICB, DC and the first two IS, LCB and&#13;
LS purchases of goods or works would be subject to prior Bank reviews and "No-Objections", as&#13;
provided for in the Guidelines. Procurement of consulting services would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
reviews for all TORs, and for procedures, documentation and contracting with firms over US$100,000&#13;
and with individuals over US$50,000. Procurements of goods and services would use the Bank's&#13;
standard bidding and contracting documents, modified or suppleinented as necessary, with Bank prior&#13;
approval(s). This procurement plan would result in the Bank's prior reviews of approximately 80 percent&#13;
of total Bank funds committed for materials and equipment. In addition to reviewing TORs, Bank&#13;
reviews of contracting actions for expert services under the second and third components would cover&#13;
an estimated 80 percent of total Bank funding for technical assistance inputs. Additional details on&#13;
procurement can be found in the Procurement Plan in Appendix XV and Supervision Plan in Appendix&#13;
XIV.&#13;
g.           Procurement approvals and reporing. A procurement supervisor would be engaged by&#13;
the Center to assist in the development of procurement plans and establish procurement procedures. The&#13;
supervisor would oversee the preparation of documentation and, via consultations and where applicable,&#13;
site visits, guide staff of PPIUs with planning, bid packages, solicitations, bid evaluations and reports,&#13;
contracting and the Center's periodic procurement implementation reporting requirements.  The&#13;
procurement supervisor would also help coordinate documentation flows needed to secure the World&#13;
Bank's clearances and "no-objections" on consultants' TORs and equipment packages needing prior Bank&#13;

CENTER FOR PROJECT FINANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES BUREAU&#13;
.       IThe Govermment of the Russian Federation is in the process of setting up the above Center and&#13;
one area of concern to be addressed by the Center is that Russian Enterprises with the capability to&#13;
export are currently either unaware of the mechanisms to access their appropriate markets or are&#13;
hindered by the inability to comply with the quality requirements of these opportunities. It is&#13;
therefore envisaged that provision be made, from the World Bank Loan for the above Center, to&#13;
assist such enterprises in overcoming the aforementioned problems.&#13;
2.      To accommodate this aim approximately 4 million US dollars have been set aside for the&#13;
provision of Technical Assistance to the Center's Business Opportunities Bureau. The Bureau will&#13;
require assistance to fulfill the following tasks:&#13;
* Development of a system to assist in the matching of Russian companies with export capability&#13;
to Bank or other IFI (international Financial Institution) financed projects. The system shall&#13;
be fully translated to the Russian language and shall include access to information from the&#13;
IBOS (International Business Opportunities Services) database and/or PIDs (Project Information&#13;
Documents) together with other appropriate data sources.&#13;
* Targeting of Russian companies, with reasonable quality manufacturing capability, for training&#13;
in advanced manufacturing techniques and Quality Management, with a system to track their&#13;
training and successful application for quality accreditation to international &amp; Russian standards.&#13;
&#149; Creation of the systems necessary to produce information brochures on business opportunities&#13;
targeting exporters in specific subsectors of the economy.&#13;
* A system to disseminate Bank (and other EFI) business opportunities to branch offices of&#13;
commercial banks (Russian and foreign banks) throughout the country, whereby the latter could&#13;
offer to advise their customers of applicable business opportunities.&#13;
* Preparation and delivery of business seminars to different sections of the business community&#13;
and foreign trade organizations. The latter being selected after review of available and planned&#13;
projects to be financed under the Bank (or other IFI's) within the next three years.&#13;
* Preparation and delivery of business seminars to Service organizations and business' such as&#13;
commercial banks, consulting firms and foreign trade organizations offering consulting services.&#13;
* Provision of formal and on-the-job training in the field of international trade and procurement&#13;
to enterprises and foreign trade organizations. This would be done in order to enhance the&#13;
quality and efficiency of implementation of the Bank's lending program in Russia.&#13;

1.      In addition to training inputs, which are summarized in Appendix XII, technical assistance&#13;
would be provided to support project implementation. It includes:&#13;
*  resident advisors and other expert services to increase capacity in the Project Center&#13;
(US$1.5 million);&#13;
*  consultant services to design management information systems for both the Project Center&#13;
and the Business Opportunities Bureau (US$2.5 million);&#13;
X  consultant services to develop information and marketing programs, including appropriate&#13;
publications, for the Business Outreach Program (approximately USS0.5 million).&#13;
2.      The Ministries of Finance and Economy are also expected to require expert services as part of&#13;
subprojects to be prepared in 1995-96, to include:&#13;
* for the Ministry of Finance, completion of a debt management system now under&#13;
development;&#13;
* for the Ministry of Economy, design of subprojects to improve public investment&#13;
programming and to introduce competitive bidding for federal procurement.&#13;
3.      The GOR will seek grant financing that is both timely and appropriate to support these&#13;
activities. Any loan resources thus freed would be reallocated to support preparation of additional&#13;
investment projects. A current estimate of TA inputs for the Project Center follows.&#13;

APPENDIX XII. SUM[ ARY OF TRAINI    INPUTS&#13;
1.           Purpose of Traning. Training inputs will make an important contribution to the success&#13;
of the project and are included in all three components. The first purpose is to develop project&#13;
management skills in the Project Center, the Business Opportunities Bureau and implementing agencies.&#13;
Additional specialized training may be arranged on a case-by-case basis for PPIU staff and financed from&#13;
project preparation funds. The second purpose is to train interested firms and contractors in bid&#13;
preparation for competitive tenders. Finally, subprojects to increase capacity in the Ministries of Finance&#13;
and Economy will also include training elements.&#13;
2.            Tranee Groups and Topics. Up to 100 professional staff of the Project Center (including&#13;
the Business Bureau) and 30 professional staff in at least ten PPIUs are expected to receive modular&#13;
courses ranaine from three days to three weeks in proiect manazement. disbursement. accounting/auditing&#13;
and procuremen , in addition to sector- and institution-specific courses as needed. Most of these courses&#13;
are available in Moscow (and in some cases, at Bank Headquarters) through EDI or through local&#13;
institutions trained by EDI. Procurement training is also available on a grant basis for a period financed&#13;
by the UK Know-How Fund. A significant number of Russian firms would receive general information&#13;
on IFI projects and procurement procedures in one-day seminars in Moscow and large regional centers.&#13;
In addition, more specialized courses in project costing and bid preparation would be targeted at selected&#13;
groups such as civil works contractors, design institutes and the manufacturing export sector.&#13;
3.            Training Dellvery Methods. A wide variety of delivery methods will be employed. Most&#13;
training would be in the form of modular courses contracted out by the Project Center, primarily to local&#13;
institutions but also to the Joint Vienna Institute. In a limited number of cases, study visits to the Bank,&#13;
EBRD or exemplary institutions may be organized for managers in the Project Center (including Business&#13;
Opportunities Bureau), PPIUs and core ministries. The Project Center will also organize: 1) workshops&#13;
for technical ministries in IFI projects and in the FPP program and procedures; 2) seminars for Russian&#13;
firms on business opportunities and IFI procurement practices; and 3) specialized courses for Russian&#13;
consultants and exporters. Finally, significant use will be made of on-the-job training, initially through&#13;
on-site technical assistance provided by expert advisors to the Project Center, and later by Project Center&#13;
staff to technical ministries.&#13;
4.            Tnaining Plan. The Project Center, with the assistance of expert advisors, will assess&#13;
training needs, topics and delivery methods in technical ministries and local firms after gaining experience&#13;
with initial PPIUs and business opportunities seminars. (The Center has already organized two successful&#13;
business opportunities seminars in Moscow and St. Petersburg that revealed more specific follow-up&#13;
training needs.) With respect to PPIUs, the Center would identify core skills required in most technical&#13;
ministries, more specialized needs, and expertise that might be more effectively contracted out. For local&#13;
firms, the Center would review the IBOS (International Business Opportunities) database and PIDs&#13;
(Project Information Documents) and match them, with the use of a management information system, to&#13;
potential Russian suppliers. Based on these reviews and the results of initial training courses, the Center&#13;
would develop a training plan by the end of 1995 to improve the effectiveness of training organized by&#13;
the Center.&#13;
