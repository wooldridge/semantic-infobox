Street, Docklands VIC 3008, Australia, ("ANZ"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI i1i ,&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), heacquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, UU . he&#13;

GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("V IGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D(:&#13;
20433, USA (the "World Bar k Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internationa recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Intel -1 )nal&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir gD i the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Narkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to Ex: and&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic jr wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on existing :;:. ces&#13;
of infrastructure finance-paticularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coordinated e if. -t is&#13;
needed to mobilize private s(ctor finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an :1I s is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investrr :d&#13;
(D) Governments, development inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in E n. it in&#13;
developing the market for pri 'ate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand sic a ii the&#13;
numbers of structurally sounJ and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emer( En: e of&#13;
EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o :i /ate&#13;
investors that actively particir ate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will ben : it rom&#13;
collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowledge :c find&#13;
solutions to complex infrastiucture financing challenges that no single institution could ;a:: eve&#13;
alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure : ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF", The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera;Ii,i the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of iistitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruci.j E Nith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project pre; E n: ion,&#13;
structuring, and risk mitigatio i for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, the C1- ims&#13;
to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported by the :; ties&#13;
and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepEro vell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure pr(jects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces :i the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro ie tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I e w age&#13;
of official resources in the ftice of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular c irge&#13;
and complex projects with th B potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now intere.ted in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure  :ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth 3r with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have com to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facili!y Partnership Program Framework&#13;

Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fo. indational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their&#13;
collaboration, they are of an i idicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst t io&#13;
Parties and with other potent al partners until the GIF is formally established. The final ver :r of&#13;
these objectives and principlks will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected ii h&#13;
agreement establishing the C IF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fu-ther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing t -i lF,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by June 2015.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Prelirinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pc je ;ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati :,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia ;n I&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publ!c-private partnerships and projects with potential for commei::a&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru u&#13;
financing solutions that no sir gle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF iims to create a global platform to provide financial and coort na on&#13;
resources in collaboration witi the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th M Je&#13;
range of donor and developrr ent finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD::&#13;
infrastructure, with the input Eind ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme it c. uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppoit on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowrstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemert.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure:1&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GI can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla :s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long t: i i&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment oppDrtunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilE;3&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to operate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE L )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the arivate sector-specializing in project financing modalities tl EI ill&#13;
draw together co nparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thosE&#13;
infrastructure prclects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to ti :J&#13;
practice standarcs for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tE cl cal&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul ilil:  ral&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greatEr&#13;
leverage and adcress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resoL rces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected :o involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in ti hE&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p rin. 's&#13;
are expected to fall into one cr more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partne s-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF w I be&#13;
considered Fund ng Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partners-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-fundE d&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity supp r:&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partnurs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/ r institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wI! a&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure prcjects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara :r&#13;
optimal approact es to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, wit a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial ard/or&#13;
institutional inve, tment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmir g&#13;
management and use of func s, and development of operational policies and procedures; rc&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility',&#13;
objectives and principles, witi advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compo ii i of&#13;
the Governing Council will bE agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop :)e to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dir ict&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer o the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili:E :&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve Esi&#13;
sounding board, providing g idance and support for GIF Management, and in particular w t I&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be administered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate:1 IE im&#13;
established for this purpose (the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will ft r: cn&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo' e&#13;
toward technical support anc financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in :i'i ual&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemetation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical PartnEr&#13;
institutions, coordinated by th e GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmE n:s&#13;
according to specific project equirements and the project origination processes. Compos t o of&#13;
the implementation teams m ay vary according to the need of individual projects and&#13;
governments.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection ci iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follo'.' n&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Irlipact-projects that support the development goals of the G I-&#13;
partner institutio is;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-prclects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities E in&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pi ojects that require multiple parties to come together to provid :&#13;
structuring, arranging and financial support, and/or projects which require a b ei of&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic impac :-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial&#13;
viability, leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional&#13;
investors-such as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities--whi t s 11&#13;
meeting governrnent's service delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr,icture investments that have global public good characteristi l:  uch&#13;
as climate friendly-project:; that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisioi :)l&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne:: i\ y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppcrt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with Z aw&#13;
to complementing the resour;es and support already available from partner entities and o n:&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac tle es,&#13;
corresponding to major proje.,t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; pro ect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility sci : ri ng;&#13;
and legal, regula:ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparati!n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and P 'P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ 1:3&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- ncluding in particular the management of environmental and s:: al&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr i:t e&#13;
projects in supporting sustair able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements c r&#13;
external implementing entitie:; under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an :A! er&#13;
standards and policies, and (evelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G 1-&#13;
Technical Partners who are ( xpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitie.&#13;
