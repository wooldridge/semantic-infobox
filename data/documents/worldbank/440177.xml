The countries of Central and Eastern Europe contin-&#13;
ued to demonstrate during the year their commit-&#13;
ment to a thorough transformation of their economic&#13;
systems. Progress has occurred in establishing a&#13;
legal framework for private-sector development.&#13;
Growth in the number of registered private enter-&#13;
prises has been explosive. In this photo, the owner of&#13;
