  I. KEYOBJECTIVESOFTHEGOVERNMENT'SPROGRAMTOLIQUIDATE&#13;
                     BANRURALAND CREATEFINANCIERARURAL&#13;
&#13;
1.      The broader policy objective ofthis loan is to support an important stage o f the reform o f&#13;
Mexico's development banking sector.        Specifically, this loan supports the liquidation o f&#13;
Banrural, a Government owned development bank, and the creation, in its place, o f the new&#13;
Financiera Rural (FR), a non-banking decentralized institution in charge o f promoting the&#13;
development o f rural financial markets. FR cannot mobilize deposits or issue debt. It is funded&#13;
directly through budgetary allocations, must maintain the value o f its capital endowment inreal&#13;
terms, report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle income rural producers, and&#13;
move, over time, fully to second-tier lending.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Since the mid-1980s, the Mexican Government has adopted measures to reform state-&#13;
owned financial institutions. In 1986, the Government approved Organic Laws (Charters) for all&#13;
development banks, creating a new charter: Sociedad Nacional de Cre`dito. The process o f&#13;
financial sector reform also involved modifications to risk classification and provisioning rules&#13;
for development bank loans (May 1993) and capitalizationrules (July 1994). The Tequila crisis&#13;
prompted the liquidation o f two development banks and induced the government to initiate&#13;
restructuring plans for the development bankingsystem. More recently, the National Programto&#13;
Finance Development (PRONAFIDE) for 2002-2006, calls for the modernization o f&#13;
development banks to help achieve the social and economic goals presented in the National&#13;
Development Plan.&#13;
&#13;
3.     The Government's efforts to reform the development banks are in line with the&#13;
recommendations o fthe FSAPcarried out inmid-2001. These efforts focus on three areas:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Legal and institutional reforms to promote and strengthen non-bank financial&#13;
       intermediaries and popular banking. These reforms include: (i)    enactment o f the Law o f&#13;
       Savings and Popular Credit (LACP) and amendment to the General Law o f Organizations&#13;
       and Auxiliary Credit Activities and to the General Law o f Cooperatives; (ii) increation,&#13;
       April 2001,ofthe National FinancialServices Bank (BANSEFI)to promote savings from&#13;
       among low-income populations and promote the development o f savings and credit&#13;
       institutions; (iii)creation, in mid-2001, o f the National Mortgage Bank (Sociedad&#13;
       Hipotecaria Federal- SHF) a development bank for housing finance; and (iv)&#13;
       development, in late 2002, o f FIRA's (Agricultural Related Trust Fund) program to lend&#13;
       through special purpose finance companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Legal and regulatory reforms to improve the governance and accountabilitv o f&#13;
       development banks. Between 2000 and 2002, reforms were introduced to subject&#13;
       development banks to the same regulation and supervision as commercial banks. These&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        reforms also aim at promoting the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness of&#13;
        development banks, and limit the losses that they may cause to the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Restructuring o f development banks.         The restructuring emphasized their role of&#13;
        development agencies in charge of developing the financial markets in areas not well&#13;
        covered by the private banks. As development agencies, these institutions are funded&#13;
        directly through the budget, ceasing to take deposits from, and issue debt to the public.&#13;
        Their lending activities are (over time in some cases) limited to second-tier lending&#13;
        through banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, and their capacity to provide&#13;
        subsidies is limited, makingthose that they provide more targeted andtransparent.&#13;
&#13;
4.      These reforms set the basis for a more efficient and transparent development banking&#13;
sector, and go a long way towards reducing the problems associated with direct government&#13;
intervention inthe banking sector such as lack o f transparency inthe allocation of subsidies, high&#13;
hidden fiscal  costs, and negative incentives for private providers o f financial services. Within&#13;
this framework, the Government o f Mexico decided to close Banrural, which was the public&#13;
bank that generates the largest fiscal losses, and create inits place Financiera Rural.&#13;
&#13;
      11.     PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTINGTHE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Government o f Mexico has made major advances in the implementation of its&#13;
program, including measures taken in compliance with First and Second Tranche Release&#13;
conditions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0  Congress approved on December 13, 2002 the Charter o f Financiera Rural (Ley&#13;
           Organica de la Financiera Rural -LOFR).&#13;
        0  Congress approved on December 13, 2002 a modification to the Incomes Law of the&#13;
           Federation for the Fiscal Year 2002, to include a budgetary allocation o f MXP49.9&#13;
           billion to liquidate Banrural andto provide an initial equity andbudget to FR.&#13;
       0   The Secretariat o f Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) approved, on April 1, 2003,&#13;
           procedures for the liquidation ofthe Banrural System as a banking institution.&#13;
       0   The good assets o f Banrural were transferred to FR, including loans as well as&#13;
           movable and immovable assets.         Assets transferred to FR amount to MXP2.108&#13;
           billion o f credit portfolio and MXP240.3 million o f fixed assets. Banrural's residual&#13;
           assets remain in a fbnd administered by SAR, an agency in charge o f the liquidation&#13;
           o f public asset, for their liquidation. The deposit accounts in Banrural have been&#13;
           transferred to BANSEFI.&#13;
       0   FR's Board o f Directors (Organo de Gobierno) approved a Strategic Statement&#13;
           (Programa Institucional) outlining mission and objectives, target markets and clients,&#13;
           instruments for providing credit, promoting investment and providing technical&#13;
           assistance, and a policy o f limited credit expansion (no more than 10 percent) in the&#13;
           first year o f operations with respect to the level o f lending provided by B a m r a l in&#13;
           2002.&#13;
       0   FR submitted to the Bank a financial projections model o f its operations, agreed to&#13;
           with the Bank. The model included pro-forma balance sheets and income statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         0  branches (no more than loo), their geographic distribution, and branch staffing levels&#13;
            FR's Board approved a Regional Organization Plan establishing the number of&#13;
&#13;
            basedon projected size o fbranches.&#13;
         0  The management structure o f FR was established, including: the nomination o f the&#13;
            Board o f Directors, formed by representatives from the Federal Government, the&#13;
             social sectors and an independentcounselor.&#13;
         0  FR's Operations Committee approved a Strategic Plan (SP) on November 30, 2004.&#13;
            The SP spells out the institution's mission and vision, as well as its objectives in&#13;
            several areas including: financial objectives, evaluation and control o f risks,&#13;
            development o f systems including a management information system, development o f&#13;
            newproducts, and development of second-tier activities.&#13;
         0  FR's Board approved a Credit Manual on May 2003. The manual contains nine&#13;
            chapters which describe the concepts, rules, norms, participants and operations of the&#13;
            four stages o f the credit process: business development, analysis and decision,&#13;
            instrumentation, and follow-up and recovery. It also covers all the aspects related to&#13;
            integration, custody, administration and control o f the credit files,         and the&#13;
            implementation o f credit scoring models to determine the eligibility to receive loans&#13;
            from FR..&#13;
         0  FR has submitted a report by the External Auditor certifying that during 2003 and&#13;
            2004 it complied with the prudentialregulations issued by the Bankingand Securities&#13;
            Commission (CNBV), including norms for risk classification and provisioning o f&#13;
            loanportfolio.&#13;
        0   FR has submitted evidence that it had not received subsidies or transfers inthe 2004&#13;
            budget.&#13;
&#13;
       111.    ACTIONS TAKEN TO FULFILLTHE THIRD TRANCHE RELEASE&#13;
                                         CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
A.      SatisfactoryProgressin carryingout the Program&#13;
&#13;
      Loan Agreement, Article 11, Section 2.02 (f) (i):Bank to be satisfied, based on&#13;
      evidence satisfactory to the Bank, with the progress achieved in the carrying out of&#13;
      the Program.&#13;
&#13;
6.      This conditionhasbeen met. The Bankreceived a letter of Sector DevelopmentPolicy,&#13;
signed by the Subsecretary o f Finance and Public Credit, dated May 9, 2003 describing the&#13;
strategy that the Government i s following for the restructuring o f its development banks, with&#13;
particular focus on the liquidation o f Banrural and the creation o f FR. The Letter indicates the&#13;
commitment o fthe Government to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Require FR to implement interest rate policies congruent with the objective o f financial&#13;
        sustainability requiredby its Charter. To this objective, the authorities are adjusting the&#13;
        interest rates charged by FIRA to avoid creating incentives for interest rate arbitrage&#13;
        among clients that are commonto both institutions; and&#13;
   0   Provide, ifrequired inthe short term, and for a limitedperiod o f time, budgetary support&#13;
       to cover part o f FR's operating costs to allow it to lend at low but close to market interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
          rates to its lower income clients. Interest rates charged by FR should always cover the&#13;
          fundingcosts and the risk ofthe operation avoidingmarketdistortions.&#13;
&#13;
 7.       After two years o f operation, FR represents 15 percent o f the formal credit to rural&#13;
 producers in Mexico. By June 2005, FR had placed 262,051 loans for MXP16.6 billion, about&#13;
 105 percent o f its original lending fund. Most o f the loans have beento producers with incomes&#13;
 lower than MXP140,OOO. As o f that date, the credit portfolio amounted to MXP8.657 billion, an&#13;
 increase o f 194 percent with respect to December 2003. The average loan size is MXP62,000,&#13;
 equivalent to the financing neededto cover aproducer with 9 hr.o f corn.&#13;
&#13;
 8.      FR has also made progress towards its objective of developing rural financial&#13;
 intermediaries (RFIs).   It has provided 763 loans through RFIs for MXPl.452 billion, equivalent&#13;
 to 8.75 percent o f FR's credits. It has authorized resources to 37 RFIs and offered services for&#13;
 the establishment o f29 other RFIs.&#13;
&#13;
 9.      The evidence indicates that, while FR continues to rely on subsidies to provide credit to&#13;
 rural markets, it functions with much greater discipline than its predecessor, Banrural. This has&#13;
 beenthe result o fboth intelligent design -constraining its funding activities to the budget- and&#13;
 the hiring of competent personnel. The management is developing systems that eventually&#13;
 should lead to market pricing for at least some o f the credit going to the rural sector. The ability&#13;
 o f the institution to satisfy the thrd tranche condition o f zero net income i s partially due to&#13;
 favorable economic circumstances, but this inno way diminishes the improvement that FR has&#13;
 made to the approach to servicing rural marketsinMexico&#13;
&#13;
B.       MacroeconomicPerformance&#13;
&#13;
       Loan Agreement, Article 11, Section 2.02 (0 (ii):Bank to be satisfied, based on&#13;
       evidence satisfactory to the Bank, that the macroeconomic policy framework is&#13;
       satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     This condition has been met. The Mexican economy has gained momentum by takmg&#13;
advantage o f the global economic recovery and high international oil prices. Despite a strong&#13;
rebound o f economic activity in 2004-when        GDP rose 4.4 percent. With growth rate o f 2.8&#13;
percent during the first half o f the year, more moderate expansion i s expected in 2005. The&#13;
global economic recovery, high oil prices and export revenues, favorable external financial&#13;
conditions, and increased domestic credit, have stimulated aggregate demand in all o f its major&#13;
categories-private       consumption,   investment,    exports-raising     economic    activity and&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Inflation i s moving toward the central bank's mediumterm target of 3 percent. Headline&#13;
inflation has come down to 3.5 percent by September 2005, after a surge in 2004, largely&#13;
attributed to some supply-side factors. In order to avoid a spill-over o f these inflationary&#13;
pressures into price expectations, monetary policy was tightened between early 2004 and mid-&#13;
2005. As a result, short-term interest rates increased significantly -by 530 basis points since the&#13;
low reached in August 2003. Following the successful reduction o f inflation and inflationary&#13;
expectations, the central bank has recentlyinitiateda cautious relaxationofmonetarypolicy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.     The government has kept the deficit within its annual budget targets and in line with its&#13;
medium-term goal of fiscal consolidation. Higher than budgeted oil revenue has played an&#13;
important role in achieving fiscal targets, compensating for lower tax revenue and higher public&#13;
investment and revenue sharing with state and municipal governments.          Oil-related budget&#13;
revenue has grown by a total o f almost 2.5 percentage points o f GDP over the past three years,&#13;
allowing the budget deficit to be cut by almost halfthat amount.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The government's medium-term fiscal framework aims to further increase fiscal&#13;
consolidation and reduce public debt. The government's 2006 budget, presented in September,&#13;
updated its medium-term fiscal projections for 2006-09.       The projections include ambitious&#13;
targets on the budget balance, with a small surplus in 2006, and a drop in off-budget financing.&#13;
The fiscal consolidation envisaged inthis framework would reduce net augmented debt to about&#13;
32 percent o f GDP by 2009, from 41 percent in2004.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Price stability, public debt management and policies aimed at financial sector&#13;
development are leading to a steady growth o f domestic financial savings, whereas fiscal&#13;
consolidation reduces the claim of the public sector on those savings thereby allowing for a&#13;
sound expansion in domestic credit to the private sector. Since mid-2003, for the first time since&#13;
the 1995 bankingcrisis, commercial banks' outstanding credit to the private sector has grown in&#13;
real terms, thereby strengtheningdomestic sources o f growth.&#13;
&#13;
15.     On November 9, 2005, the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV&#13;
consultation with Mexico. Directors commended the authorities for improvements they have&#13;
made in economic policies, institutions and structures over the last decade, which have&#13;
contributed to greater macroeconomic stability and reduced financial vulnerability. Fiscalpolicy&#13;
has earned broad credibility, with a track record o f achieving the annual deficit targets and a&#13;
prudent monetary policy has established a low-inflation environment. A series o f reforms has&#13;
strengthened the financial sector and boosted its development.         Directors welcomed that&#13;
economic policy making i s taking place in a setting o greater inclusiveness and transparency in&#13;
government. The challenge ahead will be t launch a new round o f structural reforms that will&#13;
enhance the economy's efficiency and competitiveness and ensure the transition to a more rapid&#13;
growth path, while entrenching the considerable progress that has already been made in&#13;
economic policy design and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Other Actions&#13;
&#13;
   The Auditor has certified that, for any consecutive six month period within nine&#13;
   months, precedingthe Third Tranche Release, Financierahas had a Net Income equal&#13;
   to or above, zero.&#13;
&#13;
16.     This condition has been met. The evidence presented is a note dated November 14,&#13;
2005, from the external auditors - Moore Stephens Del Barrio and Company - to the Bank,&#13;
certifying the following:&#13;
&#13;
        J The financial statements corresponding to the period April 1 to October 31, 2005&#13;
            present a net income greater than zero, and from January 1 to October 31, 2005, net&#13;
            accumulated income amount to MXP639 million (results before training o f rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             financial intermediaries and before inflation loss on net monetary position of non-lent&#13;
             funds). The net result for this period (subject to revision) presents a net remnant of&#13;
            MXP465 million.&#13;
&#13;
      The subsidiesand transfersreceivedby Financieraunder any concept havebeenclearly&#13;
      declared and identifiedin each report submittedto the Borrower's Congress (up to six&#13;
      weeks before the Third Tranche Release) under Article 48 paragraphs I,11, and I11of&#13;
      the FinancieraLaw.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     This condition has been met. Financiera Rural has submittedto the Bank copy o f the&#13;
Report Presented by Financiera Rural to Congress in June 2005 under Article 48 fraction I11&#13;
 o f the Financiera Law. This report i s presented to Congress in April and June o f each year.&#13;
 Section 1 o f this report deals with FR's credit, guarantees, transfers and subsidies programs, and&#13;
 Section 2 deals with FR's compliance with the NationalDevelopment Plan. The report indicates&#13;
that in the 2005 budget, Congress approved MXP397.1 million pesos in subsidies from the&#13;
Federal Government for the Program to Facilitate Access to Rural Credit for lower income&#13;
producers, administered by Financiera Rural. These hnds had been assigned to SAGARPA&#13;
(MinistryofAgriculture) inthe past andwere transfer to FRin2005 as an offbalance item.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     The subsidies approved in the 2005 budget were assigned to the following programs: (a)&#13;
Reduction o f Cost o f Access to Credit, MXP123.8 million; (b) Liquid Guarantees, MXP99.3&#13;
million; (c) Promotion and Supervision o f Credit Operations, MXP74.5 million; and (d) Training&#13;
and Organization, MXP99.5 million. Programs (a) and (b) are designed to facilitate access to&#13;
credit to lower incomerural producers. Program (c) i s designedto finance technical assistanceto&#13;
rural producers to prepare credit applications. Program (d) i s designed to provide technical&#13;
assistanceand training to producer's organizations.&#13;
&#13;
                                      7&#13;
     Financiera Rural has submitted to the Bank detailed cost accountingfigures, including&#13;
     the actual cost of Financiera's lending and non-lending operations as of six weeks&#13;
     beforethe Third Tranche Release.&#13;
&#13;
19.      This condition has been met. FR has submitted its financial statements for December&#13;
2004 and October 2005. These financial statements show a breakdown o f FR's costs o f lending&#13;
andnonlending activities. The balance sheet figures show that as of October 2005, 50.5 percent&#13;
o f FR's net assets were invested in securities and 46.9 percent in net loans. Non-performing&#13;
loans to gross loans are 2.6 percent and, with provisions equal to 7.1 percent o f gross loans, the&#13;
coverage ratio o f provisions to non-performing loans is almost 3 times. Between year-end 2004&#13;
and October 31,2005, the net loan volume o fFRincreased 33.3 percent.&#13;
&#13;
20.     FR's income statement figures discriminate between: (i)    operational income and expenses&#13;
resulting from lending operations; and (ii)  non-operational income and expenses resulting from&#13;
training and technical assistance to borrowers and to mutual credit institutions and cooperatives&#13;
serving rural areas. The figures show that for the first ten months o f 2005, operational results&#13;
related to lending were positive (MXP 597 million) and negative in 2004, while the non-&#13;
operational income and expenses had a negative result o f MXP-132 million. Despite the losses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the non-lending operations, the total net result for October 2005 was positive: MXP 465&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
21.    The main reason for the positive operational result was the improvement inthe financial&#13;
marginin2005, which increased from 3.4 percent o f assets in2004 to 9.2 percent (annualized) in&#13;
October 2005. The financial margin increased because interest revenue to assets increased by&#13;
265 basis points while interest expense - that is, the inflationrate - declined by 310 basis points.&#13;
The increase in interest revenue was driven by an increase in the government funding rate from&#13;
an average o f 6.6 percent in 2004 to 9.10 percent in the first six months o f 2005. The average&#13;
annualized return on loans increased by 110 basis points between 2004 and the first six months&#13;
o f 2005 (from 11.6 percent to 12.5 percent), while the average return on securities increased by&#13;
an even greater 250 basis points (from 7.2 percent to 9.8 percent). Incontrast, the inflation rate,&#13;
which is the funding cost o f the capital endowment, declined from an annual average o f 4.9&#13;
percent in2004 to an annualized rate o f 2.1 percent for the first ten months o f 2005.&#13;
&#13;
    The Auditor has certified that, as of six weeks before the Third Tranche Release Date,&#13;
    the manuals referred under paragraph 3 of Part A above are being applied on a&#13;
    consistentbasis in accordancewith their terms.&#13;
&#13;
22.    This conditionhasbeen met. The evidence presented is:&#13;
&#13;
       Note o f November 15, 2005 from the Director General Adjunto o f Programs and&#13;
       Operations, describing the role and legal structure o f FR's Internal Auditor (part o f the&#13;
       Organism0 Interno de Control), as overseer o f FR's due compliance with its laws,&#13;

        above.&#13;
&#13;
24.     This condition has been met. The September 2005 supervision mission reviewed FR's&#13;
management information system (MIS) and concluded that it is being implemented in&#13;
accordance with the objectives established in the Strategic Plan. Currently, the MIS has four&#13;
main modules:&#13;
&#13;
a).&#13;
services to the different operating units and comprises the following sub-modules:&#13;
   .    Commercial Evolution. This module is used to follow up FR's supply of products and&#13;
&#13;
        Loans&#13;
   0    Physical targets&#13;
        Promotion&#13;
b)      Credit Management. This module allows the measurement in quantitative terms o f the&#13;
quality o f the portfolio inthe different operating units and comprises the following sub-modules:&#13;
       Credit balances&#13;
       Average credit balances&#13;
   0   Overdue loans&#13;
   0   Portfolio classification&#13;
&#13;
c)     Results. This module identifies the results (profitability) o f the different operating units&#13;
with respect to the utilized resources and comprises the following sub-modules:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    e   Results account by center o fresponsibility&#13;
    e   Results account byproduct&#13;
&#13;
d)      Periodic Movements. This module allows the daily follow up o fmainoperations such as:&#13;
    e   Monthly overdue portfolio&#13;
    e   Variation o fthe overdue portfolio&#13;
    0   Nextdue accounts&#13;
    e   Overdue portfolio byproduct&#13;
    e   Daily movements&#13;
    0   Portfolio recovery&#13;
    e   Non-performingportfolio&#13;
    e   Dueportfolio&#13;
&#13;
25.     The information provided by the MIS meets four basic parameters o f quality,&#13;
opportunity, amount and relevance. It has allowed the homologation o f criteria to measure the&#13;
information, and the centralization and simplification o f the access to the information. Inthe&#13;
medium term, the MIS will be further developed to meet other criteria established in the&#13;
Strategic Plan such as the capacity to assess the profitability o feachbusiness center to establish a&#13;
strategy o f redeployment or closure o f branches. The MIS will also allow FR to determine&#13;
which markets and customers are capable o f borrowing at market rates, which will lead to the&#13;
improvement o f the efficiency o f rural credit markets. Moreover, as the information on credit&#13;
quality i s refined, FRintends to securitize some loans and free resources to expand its lending.&#13;
&#13;
                                       IV.    CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
26.    All the conditions under the Loan Agreement for the release of this third tranche have&#13;
been met. Based on this assessment the Bank has advised the Government o f Mexico of the&#13;
availability o f the Third Tranche o fthe Loan for US$l50million.&#13;

            Mexico - Rural Finance Development
            Structural Adjustment Loan - Release of the Third Tranche
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Rural Finance Development Structural
            Adjustment Loan for Mexico will support an important stage
            of the reform of Mexico's development banking sector.
            Specifically, this loan supports the liquidation of
            Banrural, a Government owned development bank, and the
            creation, in its place, of the new Financiera Rural (FR), a
            non-banking decentralized institution in charge of promoting
            the development of rural financial markets. FR cannot
            mobilize deposits or issue debt. It is funded directly
            through budgetary allocations, must maintain the value of
            its capital endowment in real terms, report periodically to
            Congress, lend only to low and middle income rural
            producers, and move, over time, fully to second-tier
            lending. All the conditions under the Loan Agreement for the
            release of this third tranche have been met. Based on this
            assessment the Bank has advised the Government of Mexico of
            the availability of the third tranche of the loan for US$l50 million.
