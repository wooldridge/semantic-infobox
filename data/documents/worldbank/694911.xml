&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic Growth and Impact&#13;
1.1         Lao PDR is poor, landlocked, mountainous and sparsely populated (4.9&#13;
million in 1995). The level of economic and social development is among the lowest in&#13;
the world, with a per capita income of US$350 per year (1995), a life expectancy of about&#13;
52 years and an incidence of poverty at 46%. Much of the country's basic infrastructure&#13;
has been destroyed through wars and lack of regular maintenance, which has resulted in&#13;
poor physical integration of the country's 16 provinces (plus the Vientiane Municipality&#13;
and the Special Zone of Xaysomboune). Over half of the Lao population lives in small,&#13;
scattered villages without regular access to transport means. Agricultural activities&#13;
generate 54% of GDP and employ 80% of the labor force.&#13;
1.2        In 1986 the Government launched the New Economic Mechanism (NEM)&#13;
to move the economy from a system of centralized planning to one with a market&#13;
orientation. Since then, external trade and most prices have been liberalized, subsidies to&#13;
state enterprises have been largely eliminated, and the exchange rate has been aligned&#13;
with the market rate. The Government's commitment to reform has been generally&#13;
positive. Strengthened public and private investment and economic incentives contributed&#13;
to a rise in per capita income of nearly 5% per annum in real terms. Inflation fell from&#13;
nearly 60% in 1989 to single digits in the early 1990s (6.8% in 1994) and the overall&#13;
fiscal deficit was reduced from 13.4% to 9.2% of GDP between 1990 and 1995. Growth&#13;
prospects are good for the remainder of the decade, with GDP expected to grow by about&#13;
7% per year.1&#13;
B. The Transport System&#13;
1.3         Lao PDR's transport system - roads, inland waterways and air transport -&#13;
is rudimentary, dilapidated and unreliable. Factors contributing to the decline are the&#13;
legacy of years of hostilities which destroyed a substantial part of the transport&#13;
infrastructure; weak institutions and human resources responsible for transport&#13;
infrastructure; and inadequate funds committed to the preservation of the country's&#13;
transport assets. Moreover, the rehabilitation of the system is very costly because of the&#13;
country's rough topography and its widely dispersed population. On the other hand, its&#13;
small economy places severe constraints on the resources that can be made available to&#13;
provide the population with an efficient, high quality transport system and services.&#13;
1.4         There is no railway at present. However, subregional cooperation studies&#13;
sponsored by the ADB, as well as Chinese, Malaysian and Thai interests, have examined&#13;
the eventual linking of the Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai railway systems through Lao&#13;
In real termns. Source: "Country Assistance Strategy for Lao PDR," Report No. 15284-LA, January&#13;

PDR. Also, survey and design studies have already been carried out for a possible&#13;
connection of Vientiane to the Thai rail system.&#13;
1.5         Road Transport. Road transportation is the major mode of internal&#13;
communication, estimated to carry more than 90% of freight ton-km and 85% of&#13;
passenger-km. The country's road network, totals about 14,800 km according to official&#13;
statistics. However, except for some recent donor financed roads (mainly national), the&#13;
system has fallen into severe disrepair and normal maintenance is no longer economic on&#13;
over 50% of the network. Most of the provincial and district road networks consist of&#13;
tracks which are impassable during the rainy season.&#13;
1.6         River Transport. Sections of the Mekong River, comprising about 1,190&#13;
km, are navigable, depending on the season and other factors. River transport is mainly&#13;
complementary to road transport, but for many small communities it remains the only&#13;
viable means of transport for goods and people. River transport is of the small scale&#13;
artisanal type because seasonal constraints in depth, difficult channels and lack of&#13;
navigation aids prevent the efficient use of larger cargo vessels. Loading and unloading is&#13;
mainly by "gang and plank," since strong currents and extreme seasonal variations in&#13;
water levels make the construction of river ports uneconomic. Since the improvement of&#13;
the national road network the share of river transport is said to have shrunk to less than&#13;
10%.&#13;
1.7         Air Transport. There are two international airports in Vientiane and&#13;
Luang Prabang as well as about 17 other small airports and airfields distributed&#13;
throughout the country. A small national airline provides scheduled services and limited&#13;
international service to the region. In addition, charter services are available on demand.&#13;
The National Airports Authority (NAA) is an autonomous enterprise under the Prime&#13;
Minister's Office which is responsible for the four main airports (Vientiane, Luang&#13;
Prabang, Savannakhet and Pakse) and air traffic services.  With donor assistance,&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of the entire system (including the air traffic control&#13;
system) has been started recently.&#13;
C. Sector Development Strategy&#13;
1.8   The Government's transport development strategy focuses on the restoration of&#13;
vital sections of the transport network, the provision of improved transport services and&#13;
policy reforms to increase sector efficiency and to facilitate trade and transport. As&#13;
regards physical targets, the Third Five Year Plan, 1991-1995 (Third Plan), gave first&#13;
priority to the transport sector (more than 51% of total public investment) and the&#13;
improvement of the national road network. Road improvement focused on the main&#13;
Road No. 13 and on providing road access to the southern agricultural areas such as the&#13;
Bolavens Plateau. In addition, the Government has sought to improve linkages with&#13;
Thailand and Vietnam, including Road Nos. 8 and 9 as "access to the sea," and to&#13;
promote transit trade via Lao PDR between China and Thailand. Further priorities were&#13;
interprovincial roads and the linking of provincial capitals to the national road network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.9          Implementation results of the Third Plan were mixed, mainly because the&#13;
physical and policy targets were ambitious in the first place, given the very limited&#13;
implementation capacity of the administration.  Apart from  the completion of a&#13;
substantial part of the main arterial Highway No. 13 and the rehabilitation of roads&#13;
allowing access to the agricultural area of the Bolavens Plateau (Nos. 13B, 16 and 20) all&#13;
2&#13;
the other Third Plan projects mentioned above have not yet been started. In the policy&#13;
area the Government has begun to simplify regulations for goods transport, to&#13;
commercialize and privatize state enterprises, and to encourage private sector&#13;
participation in transport infrastructure and the provision of services. However, a great&#13;
deal remains to be done, most important being the adoption of a Road Law and a Traffic&#13;
Law to simplify and replace the existing array of decrees, regulations and directives. In&#13;
addition, if Lao PDR is to fully exploit its central geographical position in Indochina as a&#13;
transit country for its neighbors, a stable legal framework must be created for the cross-&#13;
border and transit movement of goods, persons and vehicles. This is also one of the&#13;
targets of policy reforms defined under the Fourth Plan (para. 1. 10, below).&#13;
1.10         The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1996-2000 (Fourth Plan), proposes to continue&#13;
the network development begun under the previous plan and to deepen the agenda of&#13;
policy and institutional reforms.   The targets for the development of physical&#13;
infrastructure include:&#13;
*   continuation of the reconstruction/rehabilitation of the trunk road system;&#13;
* creation of international transit corridors to diversify the country's access to&#13;
the sea and to promote its role as a land bridge for neighboring countries;&#13;
(reconstruction of inter- and intraprovincial roads to improve access to rural&#13;
and remote regions); and&#13;
*   establishment of systematic maintenance (routine and periodic) to preserve&#13;
the new transport infrastructure.&#13;
Important targets for policy and institutional improvements include:&#13;
*   administrative and process reforms, notably:  improving traffic safety;&#13;
reforming the road classification system; devolving responsibility for certain&#13;
roads to local authorities; improving the Government's capability to manage&#13;
local contractors and consultants; strengthening capabilities for the&#13;
formulation and implementation of construction and maintenance projects;&#13;
*   acceleration of economic reforms relating to transport -- privatization,&#13;
financial discipline and accountability; and&#13;
*   regulatory measures, in particular adoption of a Traffic Law and a Road Law&#13;
and measures to facilitate cross-border movements and vehicle control.&#13;
However, the Mittaphab Bridge across the Mekong at Vientiane, not included in the Plan, was&#13;
completed during that period.&#13;

D. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.11        To date, IDA has funded three transport projects in Lao PDR, all in the&#13;
highway subsector: (i) the Southern Transport Project, which was closed on December&#13;
31, 1994 (Credit 1846-LA); (ii) the ongoing Highway Improvement Project (Credit 2218-&#13;
LA); and (iii) the ongoing Second Highway Improvement Project (Credit 2606-LA),&#13;
supporting the improvement of about 550 km of Highway No. 13. An Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR No.1461), dated June 19, 1995, was prepared for the Southern&#13;
Transport Project. The main lessons learned from that first operation in the road sector&#13;
were that: (i) in view of the complexity of government and IDA procedures involved&#13;
with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement, more technical assistance&#13;
should have been considered to supplement the Borrower's weak implementation&#13;
capacity; and (ii) future operations require careful planning in view of the limited&#13;
absorptive and implementation capacity of the Borrower. It should be noted that the&#13;
physical targets of the Second Highway Project had to be revised because a part of the&#13;
project funds was reallocated to Credit 2218-LA, owing to cost overruns and changes in&#13;
project design and scope. The projects have assisted and continue to assist in the creation&#13;
of a local contracting capacity for road construction and maintenance and, with the&#13;
support of technical assistance, are contributing to capacity building in transport planning&#13;
and road maintenance programming. Although this technical assistance has contributed to&#13;
the training and transferring of skills to Lao counterparts, the implementation capacity of&#13;
MCTPC still needs to be improved and therefore requires further assistance as well as&#13;
close supervision by IDA staff.&#13;
1.12        IDA's overall portfolio performance in Lao PDR has shown that careful&#13;
attention must be paid to project design and to realistic project cost estimates, as well as&#13;
to obtaining adequate and timely budget allocations for counterpart funds for recurrent&#13;
expenditures. In addition, the experience gained to date suggests that the success of&#13;
projects depends mainly on: keeping the projects small, simple and focused; establishing&#13;
only a few key objectives; confining interventions to a relatively small geographic area;&#13;
building-in adequate technical assistance and training to augment local capacity; and&#13;
ensuring adequate consultation of stakeholders and full ownership by the client.&#13;
Furthermore, owing to the constraints discussed above, results will take much longer than&#13;
normally expected. These considerations have been taken into account in the design and&#13;
implementation schedule of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. The Road Network and Traffic&#13;
2.1   Network. The official network comprises about 14,800 km and is classified into:&#13;
about 4,100 km of national roads; 5,800 km of provincial roads; and 4,900 km of district&#13;
roads, which largely consist of rural access roads. However, these statistics need to be put&#13;
in perspective. Ideally, the national roads should form the primary network, to be used by&#13;
the bulk of interprovincial and international traffic; provincial roads should provide the&#13;
main links with the national network and within each province; and district roads should&#13;
facilitate local transport and natural resource development. However, owing to past&#13;
hostilities and neglect, only a fraction of the system provides all-purpose use, another&#13;
fraction can be used only in the dry season or by means of special purpose vehicles and&#13;
the remainder has become dysfunctional for normal traffic purposes. This means that in&#13;
practice large parts of the country are cut off from regular commercial and social&#13;
interaction. It has been estimated that the full restoration of the entire system would cost&#13;
about US$1.3 billion, which is equivalent to 70% of the country's 1995 GDP (at market&#13;
prices).&#13;
2.2         Of the national roads, approximately 1,000 km have been rebuilt or&#13;
rehabilitated since 1990 to all-weather standard and another 1,000 km will be&#13;
rehabilitated by the end of the century. The remainder is in poor condition or can only be&#13;
used by special purpose vehicles during the dry season.&#13;
2.3         Road No. 13. The spine of the road system is National Road No. 13&#13;
(1,260 km), linking Pak Mong in the north, about 150 km from the Chinese border, with&#13;
Kong in the south, close to the Cambodian border, and passing through the major&#13;
urbanized areas of Luang Prabang, Vientiane, Paksane, Thakhek, Savannakhet and Pakse.&#13;
It is by far the most important export-import road link in the country. This road&#13;
facilitates the transportation of agricultural products to deficit (northern) areas and&#13;
provides access to natural resources, health services, education, employment and other&#13;
amenities. The Government's plan, supported by IDA and other donors, is to restore this&#13;
important highway to an all-weather standard by the end of the decade.&#13;
2.4         While the ongoing rehabilitation/reconstruction of the national roads will&#13;
permit national and international access to the country's most important centers of&#13;
economic activity and to provincial capitals, the situation regarding provincial and&#13;
district roads will remain critical for some time to come, since there are not enough&#13;
resources, in terms of funding and implementation capacity, with which to tackle the&#13;
reconstruction of the entire road network in the short, or even the medium, term. Thus,&#13;
only about 60% of the country's district centers have all-year access to their provincial&#13;
centers and 15% have no access even in the dry season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.5         Traffic. The official statistics about the vehicle fleet and traffic are not&#13;
accurate because of some weaknesses in the collection and processing of the data, the&#13;
isolation of certain regions, and (possible) underreporting. Studies for highway projects&#13;
have shown that traffic on rehabilitated roads increased very swiftly, by 15% to 25% per&#13;
year during the first few years, from a low base of about 50-100 vehicles per day. For&#13;
example, since the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 270 km Namkading-Savannakhet&#13;
section of Highway 13, the traffic level on this road stretch has increased by 25% per&#13;
annum and varies from 170 to 250 vehicles per day depending on the location (1996&#13;
survey), which is still very low by regional comparison. Heavy and medium vehicles&#13;
constituted 30% of this daily traffic, buses 4%, cars 41% and others 25%. Most of the&#13;
traffic (about 60%) is international and is concentrated around Vientiane Prefecture and&#13;
the southern/central part of the country.&#13;
2.6          Vehicles. Estimates and the accuracy of the data related to the stock of&#13;
vehicles in the country and its growth rate vary substantially. Depending on the source,&#13;
the stock of four-wheel vehicles in 1996 was estimated at about 32,000 comprising about&#13;
one-fifth of medium and heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle stocks are believed to grow&#13;
between 3% and 12% per year and light vehicles are believed to grow between 7% and&#13;
13% per year. Since the liberalization of international trade, new purchases of vehicles&#13;
are mainly from Japan and other southeast Asian countries. Up to recent years, vehicle&#13;
utilization was low, ranging from about 15,000 km per vehicle per year for state transport&#13;
enterprises to about 30,000 km per vehicle per year for private operators. Load factors&#13;
were between 40% and 50% with an average load of 3.1 tons and an average load&#13;
capacity of 7 tons, which indicates that the vehicles were not only relatively small but&#13;
were also not well utilized. However, since the privatization of all except one state&#13;
owned transport enterprise, better utilization of the fleet is being witnessed.&#13;
B. Institutional Environment&#13;
2.7         Organization. The organization of the transport sector reflects the broader&#13;
government organization into three administrative levels: national, provincial and district.&#13;
Thus, there is a Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC)&#13;
at the central level and Divisions of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction&#13;
(DCTPCs) at the provincial level. District administrations are responsible for local roads.&#13;
2.8         At the central level the MCTPC (Chart1) is evolving from an over-&#13;
centralized, top-heavy organization to a less centralized one. In a reorganization carried&#13;
out in 19933 the Government attempted to strengthen the MCTPC by separating the&#13;
policy functions from operations; giving more prominence to the planning and budgeting&#13;
fumctions; reducing the number of Vice Ministers from five to two and increasing the&#13;
day-to-day operating responsibilities of the departmental layer of the organization. There&#13;
are now four line departments reporting through the Vice Ministers to the Minister:&#13;
3  Prime Minister's Decree No. 07/PM of January 1993 and subsequent decrees by the Minister of&#13;
MCTPC (No. 1238/CTPC, No. 1240/CTPC and No. 2328/CTPC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Communication, responsible for road and waterways management; Transport, Post and&#13;
Telecommunications; Construction; and Building and Urban Planning. Three other&#13;
departments, the Minister's Cabinet, the Personnel Department and the Department of&#13;
Finance provide overall support. The latter includes sections responsible for: Statistics;&#13;
Budgeting and Planning; International Relations; Accounting and Finance; Management&#13;
and Privatization; and Audits, as well as a Transport Planning Unit. The Cabinet's&#13;
Planning and Budgeting Section has branches in the various line departments.&#13;
2.9         At the provincial level the central organization is replicated in the 16&#13;
provinces by provincial DCTPCs, comprising five sub-divisions: Communication;&#13;
Transport and Post; Construction; Urban Planning; and Administration and Personnel.&#13;
However, the provincial DCTPCs lack adequate funding and qualified staff. At the&#13;
district level road management organizations are not yet fully established and rely mainly&#13;
on DCTPCs.&#13;
2.10        Planning, Budgeting, Control. The Ministry prepares two types of&#13;
documents: a five-year development plan for infrastructure projects and maintenance as&#13;
part of the Public Investment Plan process; and yearly budget proposals for the annual&#13;
appropriations process.  The Minister's General Office is responsible for the&#13;
establishment of planning procedures at the central (MCTPC) and the Department of&#13;
Finance is responsible for the preparation of the MCTPC budget to be submitted to the&#13;
Government's budget authorities (e.g., Ministry of Finance, State Planning Committee,&#13;
Committee for Investment and Cooperation). Regarding infrastructure, a "bottom up"&#13;
approach is followed. At the central level, the Planning and Budget Divisions of the&#13;
departments concerned collect the relevant information and the DCPTCs, in cooperation&#13;
with the Governors' offices, provide input for infrastructure development in the&#13;
provinces.&#13;
2.11        Because the "bottom up" approach has resulted in a large demand for&#13;
infrastructure, far exceeding available resources, prioritization is critical. However, some&#13;
projects and programs have been initially funded in the expectation that, once started,&#13;
they will continue to receive funding. The result has been that human and funding&#13;
resources have often been spread too thinly, local funding is inadequate and scheduled&#13;
works are not carried out in accordance with established standards of quality, costs and&#13;
time. Consequently, GOL has recently introduced new planning and budgeting&#13;
procedures. While these procedures are too new to be fully evaluated, they are designed&#13;
to introduce a more coherent and consistent set of criteria to more realistically plan&#13;
capital expenditures and maintenance expenditures. Procedures and systems need to be&#13;
developed and clear accountability at all levels for their implementation established.&#13;
2.12        Proposals by MCTPC to strengthen planning and budget preparation&#13;
procedures and to improve accountability at the central and provincial levels have not yet&#13;
been fully implemented. They are now included in the 1996-2000 Public Investment&#13;
Plan as part of the agenda for policy and institutional reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.13        Road Management. Within the MCTPC, the management and delivery&#13;
of the main road infrastructure rests with the Communication Department. Reporting to&#13;
the Director of the Department are four line divisions: the Planning and Technical&#13;
Division; Waterways; Road Construction; and the Road Administration Division (RAD),&#13;
which handles maintenance with its three regional offices. The Department is responsible&#13;
for administration, budgeting, and planning, and for the supervision of the improvement&#13;
and maintenance of national and provincial roads carried out by the DCTPCs. The RAD&#13;
with its regional offices monitors maintenance programs for national and provincial roads&#13;
and assists the provinces with the implementation of road improvement and maintenance&#13;
programs (Char12).&#13;
2.14        To date, very little programmed periodic maintenance of roads has been&#13;
undertaken due, in part, to the absence of a maintainable network. The bulk of&#13;
maintenance activities has consisted of ad hoc spot improvements and emergency repairs,&#13;
carried out mainly by sate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and also, in recent years, by private&#13;
enterprises.  From now on, GOL intend to place more emphasis on systematic&#13;
maintenance of a core maintainable network which has been recently identified and&#13;
which comprises 6,324 km of national and important provincial roads. In addition, the&#13;
Ministry intends to progressively undertake the majority of routine maintenance by&#13;
negotiated/tendered contracts, and all of periodic maintenance by contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of competitive bidding. This will require further development of technical,&#13;
contracting and management skills through training, technical assistance and on-the-job&#13;
transfer of skills, and will require the development of standard bidding documents for&#13;
small works adapted to local conditions (para. 3.12). The Government is determined to&#13;
expedite the transformation of the contracting industry to a more competitive system.&#13;
However, given the resource and implementation capacity constraints, this transformation&#13;
is likely to be a gradual process.&#13;
2.15        Management of IDA-financed Projects. A Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) in the Communication Department was established under the ongoing Highway&#13;
Improvement Project to oversee the activities relating to IDA-financed highway projects,&#13;
including the monitoring of all contracts and disbursements. This unit has facilitated&#13;
communication within the country, with the other donors and with IDA. Currently, the&#13;
PCU is staffed with a Laotian engineer acting as the project coordinator, assisted by an&#13;
expatriate project engineer, a secretary and an accountant. The recent assignment of the&#13;
Laotian project coordinator is a step in the right direction and, as the coordinator gains&#13;
more experience and training, it is expected that the project management functions will be&#13;
fully internalized within the Department of Communication.&#13;
2.16        Road Design. Most of the road design work to date has been carried out&#13;
by the two MCTPC SOEs: the Communication Design and Research Institute (CDRI)&#13;
and the State Enterprise for Survey and Construction Material Laboratory (SESCML).&#13;
CDRI dominates the market, since it is better eqaipped. There are few other domestic&#13;
consulting firms in the country involved in the planning, appraisal, design and&#13;
supervision of road projects. To be competitive, SESCML needs to be strengthened&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
through the training of its staff, the upgrading of its current stock of equipment and the&#13;
purchase of additional equipment (para. 3.18).&#13;
2.17        Contracting Industry. The contracting industry consists largely of SOEs&#13;
which, up to recent years, were awarded contracts without competition using centrally&#13;
fixed unit prices. The prices were not regularly adjusted, and with time, the majority fell&#13;
below real costs. In addition, the flow of funds was irregular and contract payments were&#13;
slow.  The system  resulted in under-capitalized enterprises with old and poorly&#13;
maintained equipment and inadequate management, financial and administrative skills.&#13;
Recognizing the ineffectiveness of the system, the Government opted for a policy of&#13;
competitive bidding and of commercialization, which conferred a limited amount of&#13;
autonomy on the enterprises.   During FY1993/94, all provincial SOEs were&#13;
commercialized. Currently, 11 SOEs (two nationals and nine provincials) operate in the&#13;
road construction and maintenance industry. MOF intends to commercialize 8 of them&#13;
by 1998. In the private sector, about 30 enterprises have the capacity to work in the road&#13;
sector. It has been estimated the current absorptive capacity of all these enterprises to be&#13;
about US$19 million per annum in total.&#13;
2.18        Under previous IDA-financed projects, equipment and funds were&#13;
provided to set up "technical contract units" having a status similar to SOEs. Three of&#13;
these units were converted into one SOE - the Savannakhet Road and Bridge&#13;
Construction Company (SRBCC)- as part of the ongoing Second Highway Improvement&#13;
Project. The project provided two direct contracts totaling about US$5.5 million plus&#13;
technical assistance to help the enterprise develop into a viable candidate for&#13;
privatization. Despite expressions of interest by some local and foreign entities, no such&#13;
transaction has as yet taken place. The main reason seemed to be disagreement about the&#13;
company's valuation. However, the proposed financing arrangement would not qualify&#13;
the company as privatized in accordance with the modalities agreed under the Third&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit (para. 3.38).&#13;
C. Expenditure and Financing&#13;
2.19        Expenditure. As mentioned previously (para. 1.8), the improvement of&#13;
transport infrastructure has been the Government's overriding priority. Thus, the 1991/95&#13;
Third Five-Year Public Investment Plan allocated 51% of a total expenditure of 536&#13;
billion Kip to the transport sector, which was equivalent to about 5.5% of the country's&#13;
GDP during that period. Road improvement and reconstruction represents more than&#13;
95% of transport sector investment. (Iakble2., below).&#13;
2.20        Almost all the Public Investment Plan expenditure was spent on&#13;
reconstruction/rehabilitation (notably of Road No. 13) and even the maintenance&#13;
expenditure was by nature capital expenditure, as the bulk of funds was spent on "spot&#13;
improvement," which includes anything from landslides to substantial road repair.&#13;
Systematic road maintenance (i.e., scheduled routine and periodic maintenance) is only&#13;
now being introduced (in the form of a pilot project). Although the emphasis on network&#13;
reconstruction/rehabilitation is justified at present and will also play an important role in&#13;
the future, it is necessary to establish a viable system for regular maintenance (which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
includes increasing budgetary allocations), at least for those roads that can still be&#13;
maintained.&#13;

Note:   The 1995 figures are budget estimates for 1994/95.&#13;
Sources: MCTPC; Lao Road Sector Plans; MOF data.&#13;
2.21        Funding. There are three major funding sources for capital and recurrent&#13;
costs: official external assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors (ODA); local&#13;
funding and private finance. ODA has been by far the most important source of funds.&#13;
Donors have contributed (1991/95) about 80% of capital expenditure and about 50% of&#13;
the funds spent on spot improvements. It is likely that the share of local funds will have&#13;
to increase in the future, since (i) donors are increasingly redirecting their assistance&#13;
toward other sectors (e.g., education, agriculture, rural areas), and (ii) loan repayments&#13;
will take an increasing share of the available local funds.&#13;
2.22        User Charges. Road user charges (RUCs) are defined as that tax&#13;
increment which road users pay above the general tax rate. RUCs are a part of taxes and&#13;
fees on road use in Lao PDR and can be separated into two components, charges on&#13;
vehicle ownership and charges on vehicle use. Many of the taxes such as import duties,&#13;
turnover taxes, and excises/contribution taxes also apply to non-transport items and&#13;
commodities. In addition, there are a set of license, inspection, and registration fees on&#13;
motor vehicles which parallel those fees on air and water craft. If all RUCs were fully&#13;
collected at the prevailing rates, about $13 million could be raised from the 1995/96&#13;
motor vehicle fleet. However, due to the increasing share of vehicles and fuel which&#13;
escaped tax and the lower than expected yield on road user fees, the level of 1995/96&#13;
RUCs revenues is in the order of $8 million (Annex 2.1). This level of taxes and fees on&#13;
vehicle use covers the maintenance costs of the core network in FY96/97. However, the&#13;
maintenance needs are estimated to increase to a stable level of about $15 million&#13;
beginning in FY2000/2001 (Annex32). Given the substantial investments in transport&#13;
infrastructure and the high economic (and financial) cost of its neglect, it is critical that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
the Government reconsider its spending priorities and allocate adequate budget resources&#13;
each year for road maintenance.&#13;
2.23        In the short term, potential for increasing sector revenues seems limited&#13;
since joining ASEAN would imply the reduction of import duty rates. Consequently&#13;
domestic taxes will have to be raised to compensate. Over the longer run, vehicle fees&#13;
and annual road user tax can be gradually ratcheted upwards, particularly for heavy&#13;
vehicles which contribute about half of their road cost responsibility (Annex2.22). To&#13;
increase taxation efficiency and raise more revenue, the Government should consider&#13;
removing all tax exemptions on fuel and reducing the categories of vehicles enjoying tax&#13;
exemption to the minimum in order to reduce the opportunities for tax evasion. Also,&#13;
lack of resources in the Customs and Taxation Departments (i.e., lack of trained staff,&#13;
data collection and monitoring capacity, and audit systems) is leading to revenue losses&#13;
which exceed by far the needed investment in these departments. The Transport&#13;
Department in coordination with the Ministry of Finance should intensify efforts to&#13;
update and simplify the system for vehicle control and revenue collection. The system of&#13;
vehicle licensing should evolve toward establishment of a national vehicle registry with&#13;
consecutive plate numbering and simplification of the categories of colored plates.&#13;
Simplification and integration of the licensing and road user charge system would also&#13;
allow better monitoring of the active vehicle fleet.&#13;
2.24        It has also been suggested that road users should pay for the estimated&#13;
accumulated US$1.3 billion backlog of reconstruction/rehabilitation. Although attractive&#13;
from a purely fiscal point of view, such a policy would be counterproductive in the long&#13;
run. The likely long-term economic distortions in decisions about the location of&#13;
economic activity, factor and product prices, and vehicle choice, and other distortions&#13;
resulting from the required massive user charge increases, would far outweigh the short-&#13;
term fiscal advantage. Consequently, the reconstruction of the system should continue to&#13;
be financed through long-term borrowing, general taxation (including any surplus from&#13;
existing road user charges) and carefully chosen direct private sector participation.&#13;
D. Key Issues in the Highway Sector&#13;
2.25        Institutional Setup. Since 1991 there have been positive changes in&#13;
organizational arrangements for the delivery and management of national and provincial&#13;
roads. The Government has clearly opted for more decentralized system. However, the&#13;
current system in which each province takes care of its roads, including portions of the&#13;
national roads within the province, is expected to face difficulties in the efficiency of&#13;
managing the project cycle (planning, programming, budgeting and controlling) -&#13;
particularly because most provinces are small and lack the critical mass needed to&#13;
function effectively.&#13;
2.26        The proposals for administrative and process reforms envisaged for the&#13;
Third Five-Year Plan, if vigorously implemented, would go a long way to resolve many&#13;
of the institutional deficiencies mentioned here. In this context, particular action should&#13;
be taken to: (i) streamline and simplify the decision-making process within MCTPC by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
clarifying responsibilities, delegating authority to the lowest appropriate level and at the&#13;
same time establishing effective monitoring and auditing mechanisms (including&#13;
management information system, MIS); (ii) clarify the relationship between the center&#13;
(including the regional RADs) and the provincial authorities and define each level's&#13;
rights and responsibilities; (iii) reform financial payment and reporting systems at the&#13;
center and in the provinces; and (iv) establish a well-functioning planning section for&#13;
road investments within the Department of Communication.&#13;
2.27        Road Maintenance. Although technical assistance has been provided for&#13;
some years, the organization and management of maintenance activities is still not fully&#13;
adequate for three main reasons.  First, the inadequate number of qualified and&#13;
experienced staff has constrained the development of an efficient road maintenance&#13;
management system. As a consequence, the budgeting, planning, contracting and&#13;
supervision functions are still rudimentary. Second, as reflected by the low level of&#13;
funding, Government has not accorded a high priority to maintenance activities in the&#13;
past. Third, the local construction industry is constrained by lack of adequate and&#13;
modem equipment, funds and qualified staff.&#13;
2.28          Under the  ongoing  Highway  Improvement Project, the  Road&#13;
Administration Division (RAD) under the Communication Department was established to&#13;
manage the maintenance of the national network. Recently MCTPC has readjusted its&#13;
position and has given RAD the responsibility to plan, budget, monitor and set standards&#13;
for the maintenance of all roads, leaving the contracting and supervision responsibilities&#13;
with the DCTPCs. However, RAD and its three regional offices, which were created to&#13;
manage the implementation of spot improvement programs on the core network, will still&#13;
provide technical assistance to the DCTPCs. Despite some improvement during the last&#13;
five years, all maintenance organization levels still lack sufficient financial and technical&#13;
resources and competent staff to carry out their tasks.&#13;
2.29        To break this cycle, planning, budgeting, supervision, and inspection must&#13;
be integrated (and responsibilities clarified) from headquarters down to regional offices&#13;
and provincial and district levels. Furthermore, it is critical that a stable, predictable&#13;
funding system for regular maintenance is introduced by means of forward budgeting or&#13;
multiple year entitlements keyed to RAD's approved rolling maintenance work plan, in&#13;
order to secure the timely, annual flow of funds that will ensure the consistency of the&#13;
operation.  An integral part of the system  should be regular technical audits by&#13;
independent experts who should monitor the quality and cost-effectiveness of the work&#13;
(para. 3.16).&#13;
2.30        Contracting. The Lao Government has issued directives that, in general,&#13;
works, goods and services contracts should be awarded on the basis of competitive&#13;
bidding with at least three contractors/suppliers/firms or individuals (Decree 95/PM).&#13;
However, slow payment procedures, lack of funds when invoices are due for payment and&#13;
lack of competitive contractors are some of the obstacles that delay a successful&#13;
introduction of a National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure. Therefore, there is a&#13;
need to further support the Lao Government's policy to introduce contracting procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
based on competitive bidding. The long-term goal should be to contract out as much of&#13;
the civil works as possible on the basis of competitive bidding and keep only a limited&#13;
capability in-house to carry out works in emergencies and remote areas. This will mean&#13;
that institutional capacity needs to be built in MTCPC as well as in DCTPC for the&#13;
administration and management of contracts. To ensure a level playing field on the one&#13;
hand and a healthy contracting industry on the other, it is necessary to develop an arm's&#13;
length relationship with contractors and promote contractor mobility among provinces.&#13;
E. Long-Term Policy and Institutional Reforms - A Road Map&#13;
2.31        A possible long-term solution to the lack of adequate funding for road&#13;
maintenance would be to set up a Road Fund in which road user charges (vehicle&#13;
registration, licensing fees, specific levies on fuel, etc.) would be deposited. In terms of&#13;
institutional reforms, a long-term alternative would be to create an autonomous Road&#13;
Authority with an independent Board of Directors and three regional offices that would&#13;
be in charge of all national and provincial roads. However, such reforms would require&#13;
conviction on the part of the Government and road users; would take a long time to&#13;
achieve; and would require the Bank's involvement for many years to come. A dialogue&#13;
with the Borrower on the needed reforms has already been initiated and key officials are&#13;
being exposed to international experience through study tours and attendance at seminars&#13;
and conferences. The Bank's involvement in the sector will continue to assist in this&#13;
long-term reform process through seminars, consensus building, donor coordination and&#13;
support, institutional strengthening, training and strategic studies. Such an approach&#13;
would keep the proposed project simple and manageable and would permit the&#13;
Government to have full ownership of the proposed long-term reforms, to be&#13;
implemented at their own pace.&#13;

THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.1         The Government has recognized the importance of a well-functioning&#13;
infrastructure if the economy is to respond to market incentives. Its overall strategy&#13;
(shared by IDA) is to alleviate poverty through economic growth, expansion of social&#13;
services and provision of basic infrastructure. The project is consistent with this overall&#13;
strategy and, specifically, with the Bank's country assistance objectives in the transport&#13;
sector (CAS report 15284-LA of January 18, 1996), which are to assist in the&#13;
reconstruction of the North-South Road No.13 and the East-West axes of the national&#13;
road network; to improve maintenance of roads; to build institutional capacity; and to&#13;
enhance cost recovery. In line with the CAS, the project will reconstruct part of the last&#13;
section of Road No.13 from Banlak 35 (near Savannakhet) to Pakse, modernize road&#13;
maintenance practices (including contracting through competitive bidding), strengthen&#13;
contracting enterprises and promote private sector participation and further strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity through technical assistance and training.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.2         Project Objectives. The overall development objective is to support Lao&#13;
PDR's economic growth and transition to a market economy. The immediate project&#13;
objectives are to: (i) reduce transport costs through the upgrading of a southern leg of&#13;
Road No.13 and the construction of Road No.A-1; (ii) improve institutional capacity and&#13;
effectiveness in managing construction and maintenance activities at the central and&#13;
provincial levels; and (iii) introduce routine and periodic maintenance of roads by&#13;
contract using competitive bidding procedures.&#13;
3.3         Performance Indicators.   In concurrence with the Association,&#13;
Government has proposed key performance indicators to measure Project's input, output&#13;
and impact (Anne.J1). Measurable inputs will consist mainly of: (i) timely and&#13;
sufficient provision of funds by each of the parties involved; and (ii) provision of efficient&#13;
and effective technical assistance, consultancy services and training. Measurable outputs&#13;
will consist of: (i) the length of Roads No.13 and A-1 improved, along with&#13;
improvements to the pavement surface condition (roughness), traffic volumes, travel&#13;
speeds, travel times and decrease in vehicle operating costs (VOC); (ii) a study measuring&#13;
the impacts on the transport of persons and goods of the upgrading of Road No. 13&#13;
between Savannakhet and Pakse which will be carried out by the National Polytechnic&#13;
Institute of the National University before and after the construction period; (iii) the&#13;
length of roads maintained (routine, periodic maintenance and spot improvement); (iv)&#13;
the percent of roadworks undertaken by contract awarded through competitive bidding for&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance works; (v) number of staff-months receiving training;&#13;
(vi) percent increase of volume (annual turnover) of road design contracts carried out by&#13;
the SOE SESCML; and (vii) appropriate environmental supervision and monitoring of&#13;
the civil works in accordance with the Environmental Action Plan (EAP). Qualitative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
assessment will be carried out to evaluate the success of: (i) the internalization of project&#13;
management; (ii) the establishment and effective usage of a simple Pavement&#13;
Management System (PMS) and Bridge Management System (BMS); (iii) the&#13;
development of medium- and long-term road planning capabilities; (iv) the establishment&#13;
of an efficient Environmental Unit within MCTPC; and (v) the effectiveness of technical&#13;
assistance and training. Qualitative assessment will also be carried out at the end of the&#13;
project to evaluate its sustainability and its outcomes (economic, social, institutional and&#13;
environmental).&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.4         The project includes the following components over a five-year period:&#13;
Road Improvements. The project would finance: (i) the upgrading of about 200 km of&#13;
Road No.13 between Banlak 35 and Pakse to a bituminous surface; (ii) the construction&#13;
to a bituminous surface of 7 km of Road A- I which connects Roads No.9 and No.11 and&#13;
bypasses the city of Savannakhet; and (iii) the provision of consultant services for the&#13;
supervision of works.&#13;
Road Maintenance. The project will continue past IDA involvement to support the&#13;
development of institutional capacity in carrying out maintenance activities. This&#13;
component will comprise (i) a four-year slice of periodic maintenance of about 600 km of&#13;
high priority roads (including sections of Road No.13); (ii) a four-year program of&#13;
incremental routine maintenance of the core network (6,324 km) to be financed fully by&#13;
the local budget; and (iii) technical assistance for the organization and management of&#13;
MCTPC's road maintenance program. This would include measures to develop and&#13;
sustain the capabilities of MCTPC and its regional and provincial organizations (RAD,&#13;
DCTPCs) to plan, budget, implement and supervise road maintenance works, enhance the&#13;
use of BMS, and implement a simple PMS.&#13;
Capacity Building. In addition to the technical assistance for road maintenance&#13;
management described above, this component will finance: (i) technical assistance to the&#13;
Planning and Technical Division to assist and train staff in the preparation of medium-&#13;
and long-term road investment plans; (ii) technical assistance to MCTPC for project&#13;
implementation, coordination and monitoring; (iii) consultant services for feasibility,&#13;
design, engineering, and local transport sector studies and external audits; (iv) training of&#13;
engineering and management staff through fellowships, conferences, seminars, study&#13;
tours and short-term courses in-country and abroad; (v) technical equipment and training&#13;
to be provided to SESCML; (vi) vehicles and office supplies to be provided to MCTPC;&#13;
and (vii) incremental costs related to project supervision.&#13;
3.5         Road Improvements. The project would finance the upgrading to paved&#13;
standard 200 km of Road No.13 separating Pakse and Banlak 35, which is located 30 km&#13;
east of Savannakhet at the junction of Roads No. 1 1 and No.13.. The improvement to this&#13;
stretch of Road No.13 would include: minor corrections to the longitudinal profile;&#13;
subgrade strengthening; subbase and a crushed stone base course addition and topping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
with a Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (DBST) over a 7 m wide carriageway. The&#13;
shoulders would be paved with a Single Bituminous Surface Treatment (SBST) over a&#13;
width of 1 m each. Additional drainage structures will also be installed where necessary.&#13;
Since it is located in a flat area, the road will not require realignment.&#13;
3.6         The project would also finance construction of a 7 km section of Road A-I&#13;
which links Road No.9 to Road No. 11 near Savannakhet. This short stretch of road will&#13;
enable heavy trucks and all transit traffic to bypass Savannakhet, thereby reducing noise&#13;
and dust pollution in the city and enhancing safety.&#13;
3.7         There are about 29 panel-steel bridges along Road No. 13 between Banlak&#13;
35 and Pakse. All are one lane bridges. These bridges were maintained passable and safe&#13;
with funds provided under the two ongoing IDA-financed highway projects. Recently,&#13;
AUSAID has committed grant funds for the reconstruction of two major bridges over the&#13;
Xebang Hieng and Xebang Nouane Rivers. In addition, the Government has indicated&#13;
that Japan has committed grant funds for the reconstruction of the 27 remaining bridges.&#13;
3.8         Road Maintenance. The road maintenance component of the project&#13;
addresses two main issues: (i) the financing of periodic and routine maintenance sub-&#13;
programs; and (ii) the provision of technical assistance to strengthen maintenance&#13;
management.&#13;
3.9         Maintenance Sub-programs.  The project would finance part of the&#13;
nationwide maintenance program for all national and provincial roads (Annx3.2) except&#13;
roads which are subject to major upgrading with other donor assistance. MCTPC&#13;
manages three maintenance sub-programs: routine, spot improvements and periodic.&#13;
3.10        Over a four-year period, the Government would finance 100% of the&#13;
US$10.80 million (excluding contingencies) incremental routine maintenance sub-&#13;
program component on the core road network which represents 6,324 km of national and&#13;
provincial roads. At least 60 percent of the volume of routine maintenance works will be&#13;
undertaken through contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding procedures&#13;
pursuant to the Borrower's Procurement Decree No. 95/PM, dated December 5, 1995,&#13;
and its implementing regulations.  The road segments for the first year routine&#13;
maintenance program are fixed in the list mentioned in the Five-Year Road Maintenance&#13;
Plan, dated January 1997. The additional road segments covered by each following&#13;
annual work program will be identified by RAD within the core network (6,324 km).&#13;
3.11        The periodic sub-program would also focus on only the maintainable core&#13;
road network. IDA funds amounting to US$7.6 million (excluding contingencies) and&#13;
Lao Government funds amounting to US$0.4 million would finance a four-year slice of&#13;
maintenance civil works on about 600 km of roads (mainly paved), which will be selected&#13;
on the basis of multiple criteria comprising economic evaluation, geographical&#13;
distribution, traffic volume, network connectivity and year-round accessibility. However,&#13;
the determination of the Economic Rate of Retum (ERR) will be mandatory for each&#13;
proposed segment to be financed with Project funds. The road segments for the periodic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
maintenance program will be selected on the basis of multiple criteria comprising a&#13;
mandatory economic evaluation, geographical distribution, traffic volumes, network&#13;
connectivity, and year-round accessibility. The economic evaluation will be carried out&#13;
through the use of a maintenance planning system satisfactory to the Bank. The road&#13;
segments covered by the program each year will be identified by RAD and submitted to&#13;
IDA for approval.&#13;
3.12        Maintenance Management.  In order to help RAD  carry out its&#13;
maintenance tasks, the project will continue past IDA-financed highway project support&#13;
in providing technical assistance at two levels. First, at the central level, three specialists&#13;
will be appointed. For a period of 36 staff-months, a Maintenance Management Adviser&#13;
(MMA) will further assist with the planning, budgeting, proposing of standards,&#13;
contracting, training, policy development and utilization of the Pavement Management&#13;
System (PMS). For a period of 3 staff-month, a Bridge Engineer (BE) will assist and&#13;
train RAD staff in utilizing the BMS introduced under the ongoing Second Highway&#13;
Improvement Project.  For a period of four staff-months, a Maintenance Training&#13;
Specialist will assist the development of short training courses specifically for RAD'&#13;
staff. Second, at the central and regional levels, a road maintenance specialist (RMS)&#13;
will assist the RAD and DCTPC staff with the preparation of routine and periodic&#13;
programs, contract preparation and supervision. In addition, the RMS will advise and&#13;
train domestic contractors on how to carry out the works. Detailed terms of reference are&#13;
provided under Annex 3.4. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) would finance this sub-&#13;
component, estimated at US$1.8 million (excluding contingencies) including about&#13;
US$0.2 million for feasibility, design, engineering, and transport studies for the&#13;
preparation of programs and contracts.&#13;
3.13        Capacity Building. In order to improve the management of the road&#13;
sector by the Government, and particularly by MCTPC staff, the project would finance&#13;
the following sub-components.&#13;
3.14        Road Planning. For a period of 18 months, a Road Planner (RP,&#13;
engineer/economist) would be assigned to the Planning and Technical Division and will&#13;
assist the Department of Communication with the preparation of an investments plan,&#13;
including the following: data collection and recording; project preparation, analysis and&#13;
investment decisions; economic evaluation; and a monitoring plan. Detailed terms of&#13;
reference are provided under Annex 3.5. NDF would finance this sub-component,&#13;
estimated at US$0.36 million (excluding contingencies).&#13;
3.15        Project Monitoring. For a period of 12 months, a Project Coordinator&#13;
Assistant (PCA) would assist the local Project Coordinator (PC) with overall project&#13;
implementation, coordination and monitoring. Funds for additional short-term PCA&#13;
assignments (up to a total of 12 months) are also provided under the project. Detailed&#13;
terms of reference are given under Annex 3.6. NDF would finance this sub-component,&#13;
estimated at US$0.48 million (excluding contingencies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
3.16        Engineering designs, Studies and Audits..  An aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.35 million (excluding contingencies), financed by IDA, is provisioned under the&#13;
project for consultant services.  These services would include feasibility, design,&#13;
engineering, and local transport studies for the preparation of future projects and external&#13;
independent audits of project accounts. In addition, in order to help MCTPC and RAD&#13;
to improve the effectiveness of the Project, and in particular the routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance components, it was agreed that a technical audit (Annex 3.3, TOR) will be&#13;
carried out annually by an independent consultant (transport economist/engineer, 2 staff-&#13;
months/year). The main objectives of the audit will consist of reviewing: (i) actual&#13;
expenditures versus the approved program; (ii) timeliness of provision of funds; (iii)&#13;
supporting documents; (iv) that the quality and quantity of works are consistent with&#13;
contract specifications or works convention; and (v) effectiveness of technical assistance&#13;
under the Project. The technical audit will be presented to the MCTPC and IDA for&#13;
discussion with a view to strengthening contract management procedures.&#13;
3.17        Training.   An aggregate amount of US$0.5 million (excluding&#13;
contingencies), financed by IDA, is provisioned under the project to finance: (i) English&#13;
language training courses; (ii) an International Policy Round Table where Lao&#13;
Government high level officials would meet their counterparts from two/three Asian&#13;
countries in order to share views and experiences regarding road management and&#13;
financing; (iii) four two-day workshops/seminars for MCTPC high level officials&#13;
regarding transport policies, economic evaluation, procurement principles, management&#13;
principles, information systems, and financial analysis; (iv) a Human Resource&#13;
Development Strategy and Action Plan (HRDSAP) which will review and evaluate&#13;
training carried out and propose a training strategy and plan for the road sub-sector; (v)&#13;
fellowships for two candidates over two years; (vi) preparation and training of&#13;
Communication Training Center (CTC) trainers for three courses--"Transport Policy&#13;
Analysis and Planning Techniques," "Project Preparation, Analysis and Investments&#13;
Decisions" and "Environmental Impact of Road Projects"; and (vii) small equipment,&#13;
didactic materials and other short training courses. Details of the training programs are&#13;
given under Annex 3.7 and in project files. Implementation of this component will&#13;
require the employment of short-term consultant services.&#13;
3.18        Consulting Industry Support. IDA would finance the purchase of survey,&#13;
computer and software equipment, including training (about US$0.32 million excluding&#13;
contingencies) to be provided to SESCML, in order to increase its competitiveness.&#13;
Details are given under Annex 3.8.&#13;
3.19        Logistic Support (Goods and Operating Costs).  Goods. IDA would&#13;
finance purchase of vehicles and office supplies to help the Department of&#13;
Communications carry out project monitoring and supervision (about US$0.1 million&#13;
excluding contingencies). Operating Costs. IDA would also finance incremental&#13;
operating costs related to supervision, consisting mainly of vehicle operation and project-&#13;
related travel expenses, excluding Government officials' salaries (about US$0.2 million&#13;
excluding contingencies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
3.20        In order to increase the effectiveness of on-the-job training, all terms of&#13;
reference for each technical assistance assignment financed under the project will include&#13;
the task of preparing Skills Transfer Action Plan (STAP), which will be monitored with&#13;
the help of a quarterly reciprocal review (TA and counterpart). Proposed performance&#13;
indicators for STAP and reviews are included in the PIP.&#13;
D. Environmental and Social Assessment&#13;
3.21        The project is expected to have no significant negative environmental,&#13;
ecological and social impacts, since no major changes will be made in the alignment of&#13;
Road No.13. The project does not involve resettlcment of any persons or any adverse&#13;
impact on ethnic minorities. The road is already wide and is gravel surfaced, and no land&#13;
acquisition will be required for paving the surface and reconstructing the shoulders. It&#13;
will not be necessary to encroach on forest lands or to cut trees. Primary forests have&#13;
already been cut during the original construction of the road and the secondary growth&#13;
consists of bushes and shrubs. Fresh encroachments into existing forests will not be&#13;
necessary. One possible impact of improving the road would be that this would encourage&#13;
further settlements along the road, which might possibly lead to increased cutting of trees&#13;
in the forests. The forest authorities will have to take necessary action in implementing&#13;
the existing policy to prohibit any further encroachment.&#13;
3.22        According to the Guidelines for ReduLcing Environmental Effects of Road&#13;
Projects, which have been formally approved and adopted by the Government, there are&#13;
two categories of road projects: those having no potentially significant environmental&#13;
impacts ( Category I ) and those with potentially adverse environmental impact (Category&#13;
II). The current project falls in the first category, requiring preparation of a simple&#13;
environmental action plan (EAP) listing the specific mitigation measures needed to&#13;
reduce potential environmental effects and identifying those responsible for the&#13;
implementation of these measures. Likely minor impacts of the project, such as soil&#13;
erosion, open borrow pits and water siltation, would bc mitigated in accordance with the&#13;
guidelines. An EAP has been prepared with the assistance of an Environmental Specialist&#13;
(Annex 3.9).&#13;
3.23        To further strengthen the sector's environment management capability, an&#13;
Environmental Unit is being set up in the Planning and Technical Division of MCTPC's&#13;
Communication Department, which will be responsible for future environmental impact&#13;
assessments (EIAs) of road projects, preparation of EA Ps and monitoring of mitigation&#13;
measures. An MCTPC staff member has already been identified who will receive&#13;
training under the project in environmental and social imypact assessment and monitoring.&#13;
Steps to implement the EAP (including any modifications) would be taken in&#13;
coordination with the Science and Technology Organization (STENO) which has already&#13;
initiated actions to set up an Environment Managemeni Agency that will ultimately be&#13;
responsible for clearing and steering such projects in the future. This office functions&#13;
directly under the Prime Minister and is in the process of issuing a General Decree&#13;
outlining the policies for environment management in Lao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.24        Project Cost-. The project would have an estimated total cost of about&#13;
63.75 billion Kip (US$ 68.92 million equivalent), with 1996 as a base year for unit prices.&#13;
This amount includes the foreign exchange component, which is estimated at US$53.45&#13;
million or about 78% of total costs. Physical contingencies of 8% of the base costs of&#13;
civil works have been included for all relevant components. Inflation rates, in line with&#13;
Bank estimates, of 2.3% per year for foreign costs and of 7.7% in 1997 and 6.8% per year&#13;
from 1998 for local costs, have been considered. Based on Lao PDR legislation, the&#13;
import of goods and services under the project will be exempt from taxes and duties.&#13;
3.25        The cost estimate for the road upgrading component averages about&#13;
US$160,000/km (excluding contingencies) and is based on engineering analyses and&#13;
costs prevailing in the construction industry in Lao PDR. Estimates for maintenance&#13;
costs are based on the Maintenance Study and various consultants' reviews. Costs of&#13;
consultant services, technical assistance, equipment and training are based on current&#13;
market prices.&#13;
3.26        Financing. The proposed Credit of US$48 million equivalent will cover&#13;
about 70% of the total project cost, including about 88% of foreign costs. In addition, the&#13;
Lao Government has requested a credit of US$5.75 million equivalent from the Nordic&#13;
Development Fund (NDF) to finance consultant services and technical assistance. Parallel&#13;
co-financing under the NDF credit would be provided on the same terms and conditions&#13;
as the proposed IDA credit, with the major exception that procurement of goods and&#13;
services under the credit would be restricted to NDF members (Denmark, Finland,&#13;
Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The proposed IDA and NDF credits would be cross-&#13;
effective. The Government will contribute about US$15.17 million. Project cost and&#13;
financing arrangements are summarized in Table 3.1 in this text and details are provided&#13;
in Annexes 3.10 and 3.11.&#13;

(PCU).&#13;
3.28        The CD would be responsible for the improvement of the Banlak 35 -&#13;
Pakse Road and Road A-I and would be assisted by a PMU to be established in&#13;
Savannakhet and staffed with a qualified engineer, an accountant and the necessary&#13;
support staff. The PMU would review and approve the works carried out by the&#13;
contractors and the supervising consultant. Tnhe Government has agreed to create and&#13;
maintain the PMU until the completion of the contracts.&#13;
3.29        The RAD and its three regional offices will continue to develop and&#13;
manage all maintenance sub-programs for the core network. At the central office, an&#13;
experienced Maintenance Management Adviser will provide assistance to the RAD with&#13;
maintenance planning, budgeting, policy development and implementation. A second&#13;
maintenance specialist will provide assistance in the implementation of the periodic&#13;
maintenance sub-program and will help with the preparation of contract documents, bid&#13;
evaluations, supervision, and training of contractors. The DCTPCs will provide qualified&#13;
staff to help the RAD prepare the maintenance sub-programs, procure the contracts and&#13;
supervise the works.&#13;
3.30        Overall project administration and coordination will be provided by the&#13;
PCU. This unit, which currently oversees the implementation of the two ongoing IDA-&#13;
financed highway projects, will be maintained during the proposed project and supported&#13;
with technical assistance (Project Coordinator Assistant, PCA). Recently, MCTPC has&#13;
appointed one of its staff as Project Coordinator (PC). Under the project, the PC will&#13;
receive on-the-job training by the PCA for a minimum of 12 months. If required, another&#13;
period of up to 12 months of assistance by the PCA will be financed. Accounting services&#13;
to the unit will be provided by the DOC Disbursement Division. Full integration of the&#13;
PCU in the existing MCTPC structure will be pursued under the project.&#13;
3.31        In addition to the Communication Department, the Personnel Department&#13;
and its Manpower and Organization Development Division (MODD) will be responsible&#13;
for implementing the specific training component.&#13;
3.32        The improvement of Roads No. 13 and No.A-l will begin at the end of&#13;
1997 and is expected to be completed in the year 2000.  Routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance works under the project would begin in FY1997/98 for a four-year slice of&#13;
the longer-term program. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2002&#13;
and the Credit closed by June 30, 2003. Annex 3.12 shows the proposed implementation&#13;
schedule.&#13;

G. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.33        Stakeholders' Workshop.   The Government and MCTPC  have&#13;
demonstrated a strong commitment to the project preparation and its implementation&#13;
phases. At the preparation stage, MCTPC organized a stakeholders' workshop in Pakse&#13;
which successfully discussed and sought consensus on the objectives, scope and&#13;
implementation arrangements for the project. Representatives of MCTPC, CPC, MOF,&#13;
the DCTPCs, the Lao Freight Forwarding Company, the Transporters' Association, the&#13;
Land and Water Taxi Company, and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as provincial&#13;
authorities, consultants and contractors, attended the workshop.&#13;
3.34        Project Implementation Plan. As a follow-up, an MCTPC team, with&#13;
technical assistance support, has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) (project&#13;
file). The PIP covers policy and legislative measures as well as the financial and human&#13;
resources needed to ensure efficient and timely implementation of the various&#13;
components of the project. The PIP will serve as the framework for the implementation&#13;
and monitoring of the project.&#13;
3.35        Road Design and Engineering. MCTPC has hired a local consulting&#13;
firm (CDRI) to carry out topographical surveys, materials identification, traffic counts,&#13;
detailed designs, preparation of bidding documents and all other activities related to the&#13;
improvement of Roads No.13 and A-1. Funds from the ongoing Second Highway&#13;
Improvement Project are financing the contract, and it is expected that all documentation&#13;
will be ready by April 1997. Meanwhile, MCTPC has launched the contractor pre-&#13;
qualification process. Award of the civil works contracts is expected in the last quarter of&#13;
1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -&#13;
3.36        Maintenance Sub-programs. MCTPC  provided a five-year road&#13;
expenditure history accompanied by a comprehensive five-year expenditure plan for each&#13;
maintenance sub-programs (Anne&amp;x3.2 ). RAD has prepared a list of priority roads which&#13;
will be part of the periodic maintenance sub-program (ref.: PIP). With current technical&#13;
assistance, contract documents will be finalized for FY1997/98.&#13;
3.37        Consultant Services. Steps for engaging consultant services financed&#13;
under the project have been identified and will be implemented by the PCU.&#13;
3.38        Privatization of SRBCC. The Government has confirmed its strong&#13;
commitment to privatize SRBCC (para. 2.18) which will be effective by December 31,&#13;
1997, according to the modalities adopted by the Government under the Third Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit for the privatization of state-owned enterprises.&#13;
3.39        Road Numbering and Referencing  Systems. Among the main&#13;
recommendations of the National Transport Study carried out in 1990, the establishment&#13;
of an administrative road classification system along with its numbering and referencing&#13;
were proposed. Recognizing the importance of this proposal, the Government has begun&#13;
developing the systems. First, the Govermnent has prepared an administrative definition&#13;
of categories of road. Second, the rationale behind the numbering and referencing system&#13;
is under development and would be employed over the entire network, starting with the&#13;
national roads. The approval by Ministerial Decision (Khotoklong) of a numbering and&#13;
referencing systems of the road network and the numbering of the national roads is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.40        Donor Coordination. Other donors active in the transport sector are&#13;
ADB, AUSAID, SIDA, JICA, KfW, UNDP, ILO, OPEC and UNCDP. A transport sector&#13;
donor coordination meeting was held in Vientiane in February 1996 covering: (i) the road&#13;
sector; (ii) development plan 1996-2000; (iii) road maintenance; and (iv) capacity&#13;
building. At this meeting it was generally recognized that there was need for greater&#13;
coordination of donor activities to enhance benefits from road investments, reduce the&#13;
work load of MCTPC and avoid duplication of efforts. As a follow up, two others small&#13;
scale donors' meeting with main donors involved in the road sector were held, one in&#13;
October 1996 and the other in February 1997. During these meetings, a "sector&#13;
approach" opposed to the usual "project by project approach" was developed and&#13;
endorsed by all stakeholders.&#13;

3.42        Procurement Implementation. Procurement implementation timetables&#13;
are given under Annex 3.13. All procurement activities will be managed by the PCU&#13;
except for routine and periodic road maintenance, which will be handled by RAD (with&#13;
initial assistance from the PCU). The PCU is familiar with Bank procurement procedures&#13;
through its involvement in the previous highway projects. Goods and civil works will be&#13;
procured using the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits, January 1995, revised January 1996 and August 1996." The Borrower will be&#13;
required to use the Bank Standard Bidding Documents for goods and works under ICB,&#13;
Bank Standard Form of Contract for consultant services and the Standard Bid Evaluation&#13;
Form for evaluation of bids. Advertising through a Specific Procurement Notice in the&#13;
development business and/or well-known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade&#13;
publications of wide international circulation will be mandatory for contracts with&#13;
estimated values exceeding US$10 million. An understanding was also be obtained from&#13;
the Government that, for works and goods procured under NCB, standard bidding&#13;
documents, being developed by the Government with technical assistance from a&#13;
consultant, would be used subject to review and clearance by IDA.&#13;
3.43        IDA-financed civil works have been divided between ICB and NCB&#13;
packages. Bidders for works procured under ICB procedures would be pre-qualified in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines. Eligible domestic contractors' bids will be evaluated&#13;
on a 7.5% margin of preference for ICB contracts. The NCB component takes into&#13;
account such factors as geographic spread, the size of individual contracts and the&#13;
objective of fostering the local contracting industry.&#13;
3.44        Civil Works. Works under the road improvement component would be&#13;
packaged in two lots totaling about US$39.40 million including contingencies and would&#13;
be procured using ICB. The first lot, of about US$20.4 million, will include 7 km of&#13;
Road A-1 and 100 km of Road No.13 south from Banlak 35 (located at the junction of&#13;
Roads No.11 and 13). The second lot, of about US$19.0 million, will include 100 km of&#13;
Road No.13 north from Pakse.&#13;
3.45        The periodic maintenance sub-program will consist of between five and 10&#13;
widely scattered contracts per year varying from US$100,000 to US$700,000 for a total&#13;
of US$9.42 million, including contingencies. NCB documents developed on the basis of&#13;
the IDA Standard Bidding Documents for Smaller Works and acceptable to IDA would&#13;
be used. Award of contracts will be based on post-qualification procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Association.&#13;
3.46        Goods. International shopping would be used for procurement of goods&#13;
valued above US$50,000 per contract, for an aggregate amount of US$360,000 including&#13;
contingencies. National shopping would be used for goods valued less than US$50,000&#13;
for an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000. Where feasible, vehicles and office supplies&#13;
would be procured through the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Organization&#13;
(IAPSO). For international shopping, at least three price quotations from no fewer than&#13;
two countries would be sought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3.47        Consultant Services. All consulting services and technical assistance&#13;
(about 40 staff-months) financed by IDA would be procured in accordance with&#13;
principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA, based on the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981). Consulting services and technical assistance (about 300 staff-months)&#13;
financed on a parallel basis by NDF funds would be procured in accordance with NDF&#13;
guidelines. In this regard, only firms or individuals having their headquarters in NDF&#13;
member countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) are eligible. It was&#13;
agreed that joint NDF-IDA reviews and comments will be sought for all procurement&#13;
matters involving NDF financing.&#13;
3.48        Miscellaneous - Incremental Operating Costs.  Operating costs for&#13;
about US$220,000 including contingencies related to supervision, vehicle operation,&#13;
office supplies and project-related travel expenses, excluding Government officials'&#13;
salaries, would be procured through national shopping with price quotations from at least&#13;
three suppliers, where feasible.&#13;
3.49        Procurement Review. All IDA-financed civil works contracts procured&#13;
under ICB procedures will be subject to IDA's prior review. All civil works contracts&#13;
under NCB procedures estimated to cost more than US$250,000 will be subject to IDA's&#13;
prior review. This will cover more than 80% of the procurement for works (100 percent,&#13;
ICB for about US$39.4 million; 50 percent, NCB for about US$4.7 million). All IDA-&#13;
financed contracts for goods procured under international shopping estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$50,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review, covering 80% of the total&#13;
value of IDA-financed goods. The prior review threshold for consultant services will be&#13;
US$100,000 in the case of consulting firms and US$50,000 in the case of individual&#13;
consultants. However, all terms of reference, sole-source contracts, or contracts of a&#13;
special nature for consultant services would be subject to prior review. Selective post&#13;
review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels will be carried out during&#13;
supervision missions on about one in four works and goods contracts.&#13;
I. Disbursements&#13;
3.50        The Credit is expected to be disbursed fully by June 30, 2003. It will be&#13;
disbursed against the categories summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
3.51        The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 3.14) is based on the&#13;
detailed project implementation schedule. It shows schedules of estimated disbursements&#13;
under the proposed Credit and the standard disbursement profiles in the East Asian&#13;
Region for infrastructure projects. Disbursement is expected to be faster than the regional&#13;
profile because the upgrading of Roads No.13 and A-1 is expected to start immediately&#13;
after the effectiveness of the Credit. The pre-qualification process is already ongoing and&#13;
the detailed designs and contract documentation are expected to be completed in March&#13;
1997. The award of the contracts is expected in October 1997. In addition, MCTPC has&#13;
gained substantial experience under the past and ongoing IDA-financed projects.&#13;

Total                                  48.00&#13;
3.52        Full documentation would be required to support withdrawal application&#13;
for all civil works contracts above US$250,000; for all goods contracts above US$&#13;
50,000; for all contracts involving consulting firms above US$100,000; and for all&#13;
contracts involving individual consultants above US$50,000. Below these amounts,&#13;
disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The&#13;
contracts related to SOE expenditures would be retained by MCTPC and made available&#13;
for review by IDA supervision missions&#13;
3.53        To facilitate disbursements under the project, a Special U.S. Dollar&#13;
Account with an authorized allocation of US$3 million would be established in the&#13;
Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao.  The account would be used for all&#13;
expenditures of less than US$600,000 equivalent, both foreign and local, under all&#13;
categories. Expenditures above US$600,000 may be submitted directly to IDA for&#13;
payment. Application for the replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted&#13;
monthly or when the amounts withdrawn equal 20% of the initial deposit, whichever&#13;
comes first.&#13;
J. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.54        the implementing agency would establish and maintain separate accounts&#13;
for all expenditures under the project. These accounts would be audited annually by non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
governmental, independent and experienced auditors acceptable to IDA. The audits&#13;
would cover the Special Account and the Project Accounts, including a separate opinion&#13;
on the statements of expenditure (SOEs) to be used as a basis for disbursements. These&#13;
audits would be provided to IDA within four months of the end of each government fiscal&#13;
year and will be audited annually by non-governmental, independent and experienced&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA.&#13;
K. Supervision Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
3.55        The Government has agreed to hold a project launch workshop soon after&#13;
the Credit is declared effective as well as to carry out annual implementation reviews by&#13;
June 30 of each year commencing in 1998. A mid-term review will be carried out by June&#13;
30, 1999. The launch workshop will be held in Vientiane. All implementing agencies&#13;
will be involved and representatives of project beneficiaries will be invited. IDA will be&#13;
represented by engineering, economic, financial, procurement and disbursement&#13;
specialists. Annual implementation reviews (by June 30 of each year commencing in&#13;
1998) and a mid-term review (by June 30, 1999) will be carried out during Project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.56        During the course of implementation the project will be supervised in&#13;
accordance with the supervision plan shown in Annex 3.15. Because this project&#13;
continues the ongoing highway projects and because it would deal with the same&#13;
implementing agency, the flow of supervision would be constant over the project life,&#13;
with slightly more emphasis following Board approval in order to expedite early project&#13;
activities. IDA supervision would require a total of about 70 staff-weeks during the life of&#13;
the project. Supervision missions, which would account for about 35 staff-weeks, would&#13;
always include a highway engineer, accompanied by other specialists as required.&#13;
3.57        MCTPC, through its PCU, will submit consolidated quarterly progress&#13;
reports on the physical and financial progress of the project, including procurement&#13;
information (paras. 3.40, 3.48), in a format acceptable to IDA. The reports would be&#13;
submitted by March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year,&#13;
commencing after the effectiveness of the project. MCTPC would support IDA staff in&#13;
the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report and submit its own project&#13;
evaluation report within six months of the Credit closing date. The Borrower will&#13;
provide consolidated quarterly reports on the physical and financial progress of the&#13;
project, including procurement information, in a format acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Choice of Improvement Option&#13;
4.1         Four options were considered for the road improvement component of the&#13;
project: (i) routine and minimal periodic maintenance for the existing (gravel) road&#13;
including spot graveling and grading; (ii) routine and optimal periodic maintenance&#13;
including spot graveling and grading for the existing (gravel) road; (iii) paved road&#13;
(Double Bituminous Surface Treatment, DBST) plus routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
when required; (iv) paved road (asphalt concrete) plus routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
when required. It was found that the highest NPV and the highest incremental&#13;
benefit/cost ratio would be obtained with option (iii) (Annex 4.1, Table 3). Consequently,&#13;
the road improvement component has been based on that option. As far as the periodic&#13;
maintenance component of the project is concerned, about 600 km of priority roads will&#13;
be selected on the basis of a multiple criteria comprising mandatory economic evaluation,&#13;
geographical distribution, traffic volume, network connectivity and year-round&#13;
accessibility.&#13;
B. Benefits&#13;
4.2         The road improvement component included in the project will contribute&#13;
to: facilitating export/import and transit traffic; reducing total operating costs (of vehicles&#13;
and road); providing all-weather, year-round access to the important agricultural areas in&#13;
the southern part of the country; and linking the provincial capitals in that region to&#13;
Vientiane. Lower transport costs would also lead to better integration of the south with&#13;
the north. There would be additional (non-quantifiable) benefits from improved traffic&#13;
safety, institutional strengthening and training.&#13;
4.3         The road maintenance component, covering periodic maintenance on&#13;
about 600 km of high priority roads, will help preserve past investments in the road&#13;
infrastructure and reduce the cost of transport for goods and passengers. Equally&#13;
important, it is expected to be instrumental in introducing systematic road maintenance,&#13;
developing local maintenance capabilities, strengthening the organization of maintenance&#13;
at the central and provincial levels and improving their management efficiency.&#13;
C. Economic Evaluation&#13;
4.4         Traffic. It is not appropriate to base traffic forecasts on past and present&#13;
aggregate trends because, first, the major part of the network is not functional, which&#13;
means that a substantial part of normal traffic is suppressed, and, second, the existing&#13;
official traffic statistics are deficient. The National Transport Study team estimated that&#13;
over the long term normal traffic growth would be between 7% and 10% per year. This is&#13;
reasonable if compared with past and forecast GDP growth rates. Traffic counts carried&#13;
out on completed segments of Highway No. 13 have shown growth rates of up to 25%&#13;
per year. Without doubt, a substantial part of this growth has been generated by the road&#13;
improvements and it should be borne in mind that the traffic volumes are very low in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
absolute terms, even with such high growth rates. Assuming GDP growth between 6%&#13;
and 8% per year, long-term sustainable growth could well be in the order of magnitude&#13;
forecast by the NTS. For purposes of economic evaluation, a traffic growth of 7% has&#13;
been assumed during construction and of 8% per year for normal traffic growth over the&#13;
life of the road (20 years). Generated traffic is assumed at 25% of the normal traffic in the&#13;
first year after completion.&#13;
4.5         Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis. The road improvement&#13;
component includes the cost of construction, construction supervision and physical&#13;
contingencies for a total of US$39.4 million. Works are assumed to be completed over a&#13;
three-year period, starting at the end of 1997. After completion, the road will receive&#13;
routine (every year) and periodic maintenance (every seventh year) totaling US$9.4&#13;
million over the lifetime of the road.  It has also been assumed that without the&#13;
investment the road would receive routine maintenance and minimal periodic&#13;
maintenance. This means that the road would not deteriorate to the status of a bad gravel&#13;
road. The economic evaluation has been carried out by means of the HDM-III model, by&#13;
adapting its parameters to values appropriate to conditions in Lao PDR.4 On this basis,&#13;
the Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire road improvement of 200 km, discounted at&#13;
10%, amounts to US$19.45 million and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is 19.2%&#13;
percent (Annex 4.1, Table 1). Various scenarios were developed to test the likely effects&#13;
of variations in traffic, costs and benefits. The results show that the proposed road&#13;
improvement is justified, even under adverse assumptions. Only in the unlikely event of a&#13;
combination of adverse conditions (capital and recurrent increase by 40% and benefits&#13;
decrease by 40%) would the NPV and ERR become marginal--i.e., below 10%&#13;
(Annex.4.1. Table 2).&#13;
4.6         As regards the pilot periodic maintenance component, the final choice of&#13;
road segments to form part of the program and comprising about 600 km would attempt&#13;
to include only sections with a positive NPV (at a 10% discount rate) and an ERR greater&#13;
than 10%. The road segments tentatively chosen for the program comprise national and&#13;
provincial roads, paved and unpaved, with traffic volumes estimated between 80 and 150&#13;
ADT and with their condition ranging between IRI 6 and 10 on average for paved roads&#13;
and between IRI 8 and 15 for gravel roads.&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
4.7         The main project risks relate to the weak implementation capacity on the&#13;
part of the governmental agencies and of the domestic contracting industry and the need&#13;
for timely provision of local budgetary resources. Measures to mitigate these risks&#13;
include: (i) hiring of technical assistance for project implementation and monitoring, and&#13;
capacity building through on-the-job training (skills transfer would be closely monitored&#13;
to ensure the effectiveness of institutional capacity building, [para. 3.20]); (ii) hiring of&#13;
technical assistance to advise and assist domestic contractors in executing the works; (iii)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

implementation of the recommendations of a Public Expenditure Review (which is under&#13;
final review) to identify recurrent expenditure shortages, plan public investment in high&#13;
priority areas and obtain realistic budget allocations for capital and recurrent&#13;
expenditures; and (iv) the streamlining of internal processes to speed up the release of&#13;
such funds.&#13;
E. Sustainability&#13;
4.8          Effective maintenance and timely funding are the keys to sustainability of&#13;
the benefits expected from the improvement of Roads No. 13 and Al. The project is&#13;
designed to strengthen technical assistance and training which will enable the central and&#13;
local entities concerned to establish an effective organization and manage road&#13;
maintenance efficiently. In addition, a four-year slice of routine maintenance for the&#13;
entire core maintainable network will be funded by the Government as an integral part of&#13;
the Project. Furthermore, the civil works component has a robust economic rate of return&#13;
which makes it economically sustainable. The sustainability of the expected benefi.s is&#13;
further enhanced by the high degree of project ownership with the client and the strong&#13;
support of the major donors in the road sector.&#13;

Conditions of Effectiveness&#13;
a) the effectiveness of a Credit of SDR 4.0 million from the Nordic&#13;
Development Fund (para. 3.26);&#13;
b) the approval by Ministerial Decision (Khotoklong) of the numbering and&#13;
referencing systems of the Borrower's road network and the numbering of&#13;
its national roads (para. 3.39);&#13;
Agreements&#13;
c) a set of quantifiable performance indicators related to project objectives&#13;
and monitorable targets (para. 3.3, Annex 3.1);&#13;
d) that at least 60 percent of the volume of routine maintenance works will be&#13;
undertaken through contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding&#13;
procedures pursuant to the Borrower's Procurement Decree No. 95/PM,&#13;
dated December 5, 1995, and its implementing regulations (para. 3.10);&#13;
e) the road segments for the first year routine maintenance program are fixed&#13;
in the list mentioned in the Five Year Road Maintenance Plan, dated&#13;
January 1997. The additional road segments covered by each following&#13;
annual work program will be identified by RAD within the core network&#13;
(6,324 km) and submitted to IDA for approval at least six months prior to&#13;
the planned commencement of the corresponding works (para. 3. 10);&#13;
f) the road segments for the periodic maintenance program will be selected&#13;
on the basis of multiple criteria comprising a mandatory economic&#13;
evaluation, geographical distribution, traffic volumes, network&#13;
connectivity, and year-round accessibility. The economic evaluation will&#13;
be carried out through the use of a maintenance planning system&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. The road segments covered by the program each&#13;
year will be identified by RAD and submitted to IDA for approval at least&#13;
six months prior to the planned commencement of the corresponding works&#13;
(para. 3.1 1);&#13;
g) not later than June 30 of each year, a completion of an annual technical&#13;
audit of Project implementation will be carried out by an independent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
consultant recruited in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines&#13;
(para.3.16);&#13;
h) the timely provision of the necessary counterpart budgetary funds for the&#13;
project (para. 3.26);&#13;
i) the privatization of SRBCC by December 31, 1997 according to the&#13;
modalities adopted by the Government under the Third Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit for the privatization of state-owned enterprises (para.&#13;
3.38);&#13;
j) the procurement arrangements (para. 3.42);&#13;
k) the establishment and maintenance of separate accounts for all&#13;
expenditures under the project; these accounts will be audited annually by&#13;
non-governmental, independent and experienced auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para. 3.54);&#13;
1) the carrying out of annual implementation reviews (by June 30 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1998) and a mid-term review (by June 30, 1999)&#13;
(para.3.55); and&#13;
m) the provision of consolidated quarterly reports on the physical and&#13;
financial progress of the project, including procurement information, in a&#13;
format acceptable to IDA (para. 3.57).&#13;
5.2      Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of&#13;
SDR 34.6 million (US$48.0 million equivalent) to the Lao People's Democratic&#13;
Republic. The credit would be for a term of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;

TECHNICAL AUDIT&#13;
1.    The objective of the technical audit of is to allow an independent auditor (transport&#13;
engineer/economist) to form a professional opinion on the effectiveness of the routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance components as well as the technical assistance efficiency provided under&#13;
the Project. The audit, undertaken once a year in May/June for a period of two staff-month, will&#13;
focus on the following.&#13;
2.    Regarding the maintenance components, the audit will review the actual expenditures&#13;
versus approved budget, the timely provision of funds and the verification of the supporting&#13;
documents. The audit will verify, with the help of sample surveys, visits and controls in the&#13;
field, and by examining attachment, change orders, control test results and other relevant&#13;
documents and any other tests and controls that the Auditor may find necessary that control&#13;
teams have correctly verified that the quality and quantity of works are consistent with contract&#13;
specifications or works convention, as well as the interim certificates. Its reports will include&#13;
opinions that:&#13;
a) maintenance contracts have been prepared according to professional norms, and the&#13;
description and quantity of works accurately reflect reality in the field;&#13;
b) works contracts have been attributed in accordance with the procurement methods&#13;
specified in the credit agreements and officially agreed upon for the program;&#13;
c) the work progress monitoring and quality and quantity supervision procedures&#13;
provided for the contract have been followed correctly;&#13;
d) site journals, reports of site meetings, attachments journals are kept in accordance to&#13;
the norms of the profession;&#13;
e) the expenditures for maintenance works in the program are represented by assets,&#13;
goods and services having at least the value indicated and that any disbursement&#13;
claim under the loan agreements can be borne by an indication of the value of the&#13;
works done;&#13;
f) management of maintenance program is such that one can at any time verify all steps&#13;
between the works studies and reception and payment of the works studies underway,&#13;
works being attributed on - going works, completed works, paid for work and being&#13;
thus assured that expenditures on maintenance are well represented by works&#13;
programmed and executed of equivalent value; and&#13;
g) timely execution of the project in accordance with the agreed implementation&#13;
schedule.&#13;
3.    The audit would also provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the technical assistance&#13;
provided under the Project which comprises: Maintenance Specialists; Highway Planner and&#13;
Assisting Project Coordinator. In particular, the audit will concentrate on the ability of the&#13;
technical assistance to transfer its skills as well as the capacity and eagerness of the counterpart&#13;
staff to absorb on the job training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                               Anne.3&#13;
4.    Apart from the opinion, the Technical Auditor will also submit a " Management Report".&#13;
This report will include:&#13;
a) comments and observations on works management systems and the quality and&#13;
quantity control procedures examined during the Audit;&#13;
b) the main weaknesses detected during the Audit, and proposed remedial measures;&#13;
c) any other factors which would affect future audits; and&#13;
d) any other matter that the Auditor judges relevant (for instance lists of registered&#13;
enterprises, contracts attribution procedures, the combination of work lots, etc.).&#13;
5.    The technical audit will be presented to the MCTPC and IDA for discussion with a view&#13;
to strengthen the contract management procedures and efficiency of technical assistance.&#13;

Technical Assistance to Road Administration Division&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Road Administration Division (RAD) of the Ministry of Communications,&#13;
Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) is at the Central level, responsible for the&#13;
maintenance management of a core network of 6324 km, composed of national and strategic&#13;
provincial roads. A field organization is established within the RAD for maintenance&#13;
inspection, planning, and contract supervision. It consists of three maintenance regions, each one&#13;
headed by a Chief Maintenance Engineer (CME) with a deputy. The RAD reports regularly to&#13;
the Director of Communications (DOC) about progress of work costs and road conditions.&#13;
2.    During the last ten years, the road network has been in such a poor state that the limited&#13;
funds available for road works have been concentrated on construction, rehabilitation, and spot&#13;
improvements. Systematic maintenance, such as routine and periodic maintenance of&#13;
maintainable roads has been virtually non-existent. In addition to the current program of spot&#13;
improvements, it is now realized, with the increasing number of maintainable roads handed&#13;
over to RAD, that routine and periodic maintenance of these roads is of paramount importance to&#13;
preserve the capital invested therein.&#13;
3.    Accordingly, the Third Highway Improvement Project (THIP) has retained two programs&#13;
over a five year period (i) periodic maintenance of high priority roads based on defined selection&#13;
criteria; and (ii) Routine maintenance of the core network. The work will be contracted out to by&#13;
competitive bidding to contractors, both state Owned and Private Enterprises.&#13;
4.    The RAD is still a young and newly established division. From 1990 to 1994, it received&#13;
from IDA and NDF, technical assistance to develop the maintenance organization, improve&#13;
budgeting and monitoring procedures, assess funding requirements, and develop maintenance&#13;
management systems. IDA has continued funding the support. A Maintenance Management&#13;
Advisor has been providing support for the development management systems, planing and&#13;
follow - up of maintenance, etc. The RAD has also received other support concerning&#13;
maintenance techniques and practices in the field. A Pavement Management System (PMS) and&#13;
a Bridge Management System (BMS) are now installed by the Technical Assistance Consultant.&#13;
But local staff are not yet fully trained in its utilization and, as a result, it is not operational. Its&#13;
data are being transferred to a more simple and user - friendly system.&#13;
5.    The RAD capacity is still weak and further support is still needed, the more so as RAD's&#13;
experience in systematic maintenance is yet embryonic. It is necessary, at this point, to build -up&#13;
a tradition for systematic maintenance for the sake of sustainability of the newly constructed and&#13;
rehabilitated roads.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
6.    The primary objectives of the proposed technical assistance to RAD are to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                              Annx  3.4&#13;
*  Ensure cost-effective implementation of the THIP periodic maintenance program&#13;
through the project Technical Assistance (TA);&#13;
*  Provide advice and guidance to the RAD in its implementation of the routine&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
*  Pursue already initiated efforts to build within the RAD a sustainable capability to&#13;
plan, program, and monitor all types of maintenance and in particular periodic&#13;
maintenance; and routine maintenance;&#13;
*  Secure a successful transfer of skills, through a systematic Skills Transfer Action&#13;
Plan (see para. 8, below).&#13;
Composition of the Technical Assistance Team&#13;
7.    In order to meet the above objectives, the TA team will include:&#13;
* Maintenance Management Advisor (MMA); 36 months;&#13;
* One Field Road Restoration Specialists (RRS); 39 months;&#13;
* A Bridge Engineer (BE); 3 months&#13;
* Training Specialist 4 months&#13;
Skills Transfer Action Plan (STAP)&#13;
8.    The technical assistance contracts, undertaken by expatriate consultants, as ,is serving as&#13;
the primary vehicles for technology transfer. Past experience has shown that key skills are often&#13;
not transferred in an osmotic manner through day-to-day contact between expatriate consultants&#13;
and their local colleagues. Thus, technology transfer may better be achieved through a carefully-&#13;
constructed series of plans which stipulate clearly the goals, objectives and contents of each&#13;
aspect of the technology transfer process.&#13;
9.    In order to track the transfer of skill performance, a quarterly reciprocal evaluation based&#13;
on performance indicators will be made by the TA members and their counterparts.&#13;
Duties&#13;
10.   The Maintenance Advisor (MMA) As counterpart to the Head of the Road Administration&#13;
Division the MMA will assist him in his considerable number of activities. In addition, the&#13;
MMA will be more directly involved in the undertaking and the follow - up of the following&#13;
duties:&#13;
* Strengthen RAD capability to develop contract documentation suitable for periodic&#13;
and routine maintenance that conforms to the requirements of the World Bank and&#13;
other donors&#13;
* Analyze and strengthen individual section with the RAD;&#13;
* Organize, participate in and supervise training. The TA should allow RAD (and the&#13;
provincial engineers as well), to develop the organizational, coordination, monitoring&#13;
and supervision skills for all type of maintenance, and routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance in particular;&#13;
&#13;

THIRD HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance to Planning and Technical Division&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Although attempts made in the past few years (National Transport Study [NTS] and TA to the&#13;
Transport Planning Unit [TPU]) to develop methods and skills for road planning, have introduced basic&#13;
capabilities within MCTPC, further development is still necessary. Currently, the plans prepared are an&#13;
indication of needs rather than the results of explicit priorities and project evaluations. Basic economic&#13;
concepts are not yet introduced. Methods for data collection and traffic forecasting techniques have not&#13;
been developed, and real construction and maintenance costs are unknown. Plans ignore long-term&#13;
considerations such as the interrelation between road construction and road maintenance. The concept of&#13;
cost-effectiveness up till now, has not made much headway in the public administration in general and in&#13;
MCTPC in particular. An economic "culture" needs to be instilled in the MCTPC, starting at the&#13;
decisionmnaking level and moving all the way down.&#13;
2.     Under this project, a renewed and more focused attempt is made to build up a sustainable&#13;
planning capability, but only in the road sector. Within the Department of Communication (DOC) of the&#13;
MCTPC, technical assistance (TA) will be provided to the newly created DOC Technical Planning&#13;
Division (TPD). An expatriate Highway/Planner/Economist will assist the Head of this Division in&#13;
developing the required road planning capacity. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) will finance this&#13;
assignment.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.     The ultimate goal is to make the most of the scarce resources allocated to the road infrastructure.&#13;
In light of the above outlined current situation, this goal will be attained in pursuing the following&#13;
immediate objectives:&#13;
*  To inculcate in the TPD as well as in the other divisions of the DOC the basic concepts of&#13;
economic analysis and project evaluation;&#13;
*  To assist the TPD to conceive and further implement, a simplified rational system to develop&#13;
the investment and maintenance program; and&#13;
*  Using this system, to initiate the preparation of a five-year credible investment and&#13;
maintenance program, including the revision of the Five-Year Investment Plan 1996-2000&#13;
and the assistance for the preparation of the Five-Year Investment Plan 2001-2005.&#13;
Duties&#13;
4.     The Highway Planner (H+P): As a counterpart of the TPD's Head, the HP will assist him in the&#13;
undertaking and the follow-up of the following duties:&#13;
*  Prepare and provide formal training to the DOC engineers and others in transport economics,&#13;
transport planning and computer-based methods, as well as hands on experience with the specific&#13;
methods for data monitoring, traffic forecasting and project evaluation.&#13;
*  Help RAD in developing a simplified maintenance decision methodology based on a limited&#13;
number of parameters related to the surface condition and the structure condition of the road.&#13;
*  Use the simplified version of the World Bank's HDM based on the road data that can realistically&#13;
be obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                                Annex 3.5&#13;
*  Develop real and true construction and maintenance costs based on a thorough monitoring of field&#13;
works.  This task will be undertaken in conjunction with the RAD and with the close&#13;
collaboration of the RAD.&#13;
*  Prepare credible five-year rolling investment and periodic maintenance plans.&#13;
*  Assist the TPD in developing a road data base confined to the parameters required for the&#13;
application of the above maintenance decision policy and the HDM model. This will be limited&#13;
at this point to the core network consisting of the national roads and some provincial roads. Other&#13;
basic information should include, whenever possible, the history of the roads, such as the dates of&#13;
original construction, major resurfacing, and strengthening, quarry locations, and quality and&#13;
quantity of available materials.&#13;
*  Assist the TPD in initiating roughness measurement using the existing Bump integrator.&#13;
*  Select "witness sections" of the road network recently constructed for a thorough monitoring of&#13;
its behavior over time, in view of better evaluation and improvement of the methods and&#13;
techniques in use. This task will be undertaken in coordination with the laboratory and the RDA.&#13;
*  Transfer his skills to his counterpart, the Head of the TPD in accordance with an agreed Skills&#13;
Transfer Action Plan.&#13;
*  Review the vehicle inspection, licensing and registration systems in use and propose&#13;
solutions to improve theirs effectiveness.&#13;

LAO PDR&#13;
THIRD HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance to Project Coordination Unit&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Overall project administration and coordination will be provided by the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU), which has already overseen the implementation of the two preceding IDA-financed highway&#13;
projects. Recently, MCTPC has appointed one of its staff as Project Coordinator (PC).&#13;
2.     Under the THIP, the PC will receive technical assistance in the form of on-the-job-training from&#13;
an experienced expatriate, designated as Project Coordinator Assistant (PCA), for a period of 12 months.&#13;
The assignment will commence as soon as the IDA Credit for the project is approved. If required, another&#13;
period up to 12 months will be provided.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
3.     The PCA will assist the PC in overall project coordination, including:&#13;
*  Follow-up of project progress;&#13;
*  Planning and scheduling project activities;&#13;
*  Providing project monitoring and control (procurement, disbursement, audits, etc.);&#13;
*  Providing advice on and review of the preparation of bid documents for equipment as well as&#13;
participating in bid evaluation and award of contracts;&#13;
* Providing project accounting and submission of withdrawal applications to IDA;&#13;
* Assisting with the organization of the training component;&#13;
Preparing consolidated quarterly reports; and&#13;
* Assisting in the preparation of the project completion report.&#13;
Monitoring Skills Transfer Performance&#13;
4.     Sound and competent coordination and management are critical to the success of project&#13;
implementation. While the TA is provided it is also important to track the transfer of skills performance.&#13;
For this reason, a quarterly reciprocal evaluation of each party--the PC and the PCA by the other party--&#13;
will be carried out. Each party will prepare, separately, its own evaluation report and submit it to the&#13;
DOC and the Bank for a common review and taking corrective actions, if deemed necessary. The&#13;
evaluation will be based on the rating, on a three-point scale, Good - Fair - Poor, of some pertinent&#13;
indicators (details in PIP).&#13;

LAO PDR&#13;
THIRD HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Training Component&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     Lao PDR has changed its national economic development strategy from a command economy to&#13;
one based on the workings of market forces. This has presented policy level officials, managers and&#13;
trainers, major professional skills and attitudinal challenges.&#13;
2.     In terms of staff numbers, Lao PDR is not seriously short of trained administrators, managers and&#13;
trainers in its road agencies, enterprises and training institutions. The problem is that many of these&#13;
people gained their training and experience with outmoded technology in a policy, planning and operating&#13;
environment that has been abandoned.&#13;
3.     To address the need for human resource development and training, the project would propose the&#13;
following two strategies: A. Short-term: modernizing policy and decision approaches, management and&#13;
organizational systems and analytical and implementation methodologies; B. Long-term: preparing a&#13;
Human Resource Development Strategy and Action Plan (HRDSAP) based on a systematic assessment of&#13;
all training needs.&#13;
A. Short-term Strategy&#13;
4.     English Language Courses. Apart from professional and technological skills needs, an urgent&#13;
need is for a major upgrade of English language working ability at all levels. The proposed project should&#13;
allocate funds to help both the Communications Training Center and the Vientiane University College to&#13;
upgrade their performance in this area. An amount of US$70,000 is proposed for this assistance.&#13;
5.     Policy Issue of High Level Staff. Three items are included for policy and decision making&#13;
officials: English language training; an international policy round-table and a series of four discussion&#13;
group seminars. Thefirst item will provide intensive English language programs over two years for a&#13;
total of about US$10,000. The second item will be a high level sharing of experience with two to three&#13;
countries in the Asia region. This would be in the form of a two-day round table and would include policy&#13;
and decision level officials from each of the three ministries and agencies involved in the prioritizing of&#13;
road investments. The estimated cost of this item is about US$30,000. The third item will be discussion&#13;
groups and seminars to expose the high level officials to modern concepts and procedures. These&#13;
seminars would be presented in LAO PDR over a period of two years to coincide with missions by senior&#13;
World Bank staff. The cost of this item would be approximately US$10,000 per seminar or US$40,000&#13;
total.&#13;
6.     Planning and Decision Making. Planners and statisticians are the key people in the central and&#13;
provincial transport systems who generate the reports, documents and advice on which policy and decision&#13;
makers base their decisions. There are from 10 to 15 key areas for training this group apart from language&#13;
training. The training would be through a series of short, two to four week courses, presented locally by&#13;
experts in the respective topics. The proposed project would include an item of US$160,000 for TA to&#13;
prepare detailed curricula and course content outlines for those courses. At the same time the TA would&#13;
prepare the actual course materials and train recruited trainers for the three top priority courses: "Transport&#13;
Policy Analysis and Planning Techniques," "Project Preparation, Analysis and Investment Decisions" and&#13;
"Environmental Impact of Road Projects."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49                                Annex 3.7&#13;
7.     Domestic Consulting Enterprise Development. Among the factors that constrain the development&#13;
and improvement of enterprises and private companies is the relative paucity of expertise in technical&#13;
areas and contract and financial management. A possible response to these constraints would be the&#13;
buying of technical assistance or for the provision by an aid agency TA. In this regard, the project would&#13;
include an amount of US$320,000 for training, equipment and technology for developing modem survey&#13;
and road design capacity and capability for the SOE SESCML (Annex 3.7).&#13;
8.     Miscellaneous Items. Provision is made for US$20,000 for the purchase of training materials,&#13;
reference books and training equipment that may be needed for any of the various items referred to above.&#13;
In addition, an amount of US$60,000 is to be included as an uncommitted item.&#13;
B. Long-term Strategy&#13;
9.     Training Needs Assessment. Two ongoing technical assistance programs include assessment of&#13;
the need for training in both the MCTPC and the DCTPCs. These will be most important inputs to the&#13;
preparation of a detailed training strategy for the road sub-sector. The proposed IDA project should&#13;
include as a high priority component (US$20,000) for TA to take the outputs of those assessments and&#13;
prepare a longer-term Human Resource Development Strategy and Action Plan (HRDSAP).&#13;
10.    Fellowships. The proposed HRDSAP should identify MCTPC's priority areas for post graduate&#13;
study. The project should include two fellowships to support two candidates in appropriate courses; the&#13;
estimated cost of those will be US$90,000 for two people over two years.&#13;

Environmental Mitiyation Measures&#13;
I.    The preparation and implementation of civil works contracts will be in accordance with the&#13;
requirements delineated in the Guidelines for Reducing Environmental Effects of Road Projects, which&#13;
have been formally approved and adopted by the Government. In addition, the following details would&#13;
apply specifically to the upgrading of Road No.13 and construction of Road A-I:&#13;
*  Design standards for roads would be prepared for conditions suitable for the area. The proposed area&#13;
is flat to rolling and the design speed would be 80 kmlhour and the maximum gradient would be 5%.&#13;
*  Typical cross-section standards would have a maximum cut slope of 1:1/2 (vertical to horizontal) with&#13;
provisions for flattening the batter, if instructed by the supervising engineer, in areas where soils are&#13;
soft. Adequate maintenance funds would be available at least in the first few years after construction&#13;
so as to allow for removing any material that may slip down. Cut off drains would be provided in&#13;
adjacent high ground above the cut to minimize water running down, and erosion of the slope.&#13;
&#149;  The design of the road drainage system would be such as to ensure that storm runoff is not&#13;
concentrated to such an extent that it causes erosion. This means that on sideline cuts sufficient cross&#13;
toad drains, or culverts would be provided and the outlets designed to reduce the water velocity and&#13;
prevent erosion.&#13;
*  Quarries or borrow pits would preferably be part of the initial design of the road so that the locations&#13;
can be selected to avoid environmentally sensitive areas, or areas where runoff and erosion cannot be&#13;
controlled. Environmental damage can be controlled if the design, size and method of operation of&#13;
quarries to be used are specified in the contract documents.&#13;
&#149;  When storing, handling and preparing asphalt mixes, the supervision team would ensure that the&#13;
contractor take the following precautions:&#13;
Q  Stockpile sites for drums would stock at a reasonable level and be kept clear of undergrowth&#13;
and rubbish.&#13;
0  Drums containing cleaning oil would be stacked on end with the filling hole upwards and&#13;
tilted to prevent water accumulating on the top of the drum.&#13;
0  Drums of bitumen emulsion may be stacked end on end or on their sides, but if stored for any&#13;
length of time the drums would be rolled regularly. When filling a bitumen distributor tank or&#13;
kettle in preparation for heating, it is essential to check and ensure that there is no water in the&#13;
tank prior to loading, as this will cause a violent expansion of the bitumen with consequent&#13;
frothing and boiling over. Necessary precautions must also be taken for the manufacture of&#13;
cut-back bitumen to avoid all possible fire hazards,&#13;
0  The supervising engineer would designate the areas where spoil is to be disposed of,&#13;
especially in the steep country. The area would be first roughly leveled or benched to prevent&#13;
future slipping.&#13;
o Traffic signs and directional features are to be prominently displayed on the road when it is&#13;
completed. Safety measures such as guardrails would be considered at particularly dangerous&#13;
locations.&#13;
2.     The contracts documents would include the following clauses (Environmental Clauses for&#13;
Contract Documents):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                                Annex 3.9&#13;
*  Notwithstanding other obligations, if in the opinion of the Supervising Engineer (SE), damage is&#13;
being done to the environment by the works under construction the Engineer may instruct the&#13;
Contractor to cease work immediately, or change the approach or method of work.&#13;
*  There would be a provisional sum in the Bill of Quantities for any work deemed to be required by the&#13;
Supervising Engineer to remedy any unexpected environmental problems which may arise as a result&#13;
of the works. He would instruct the Contractor to carry out the required work.&#13;
*  The Contractor shall ensure that full consideration is given to the control of environmental aspects and&#13;
that all provisions of the design and specification requirements relating to pollution of the&#13;
environment and protection of adjacent land and waterways are complied with.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall development objective of the
            Third Highway Improvement Project is to support Lao
            PDR's economic growth and transition to a market
            economy.  The immediate project objectives are to: a) reduce
            transport costs; b) improve institutional capacity and
            effectiveness in managing construction and maintenance
            activities at the central and provincial levels; and c)
            introduce routine and periodic road maintenance.  The
            project includes the following components over a five year
            period: a) road improvements, including road upgrading,
            construction and consultant services for the supervision of
            works; b) road maintenance; and c) capacity building
            including technical assistance, training, consultant
            services, technical equipment, vehicles, office supplies and
            incremental costs.
