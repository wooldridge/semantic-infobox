                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1.      By the beginning of fiscal year 2006 (FY06), a combination of three&#13;
conditions--the sophistication of middle-income country counterparts, decentralization&#13;
of the World Bank to over 100 country offices and increased reliance on newly hired,&#13;
local (frequently junior) staff and consultants--had created a situation whereby the&#13;
highest performance risks in all Regions related to staff capabilities. Regional&#13;
Managers expressed concern about shortcomings in staff (a) professional and technical&#13;
expertise, including sensitivity to the political economy of the country and ongoing&#13;
global issues, (b) practical operational knowledge, including project implementation&#13;
skills, and (c) communications skills and country knowledge needed for being effective&#13;
on the ground. Yet nearly half of observable learning opportunities offered to and&#13;
received by Regional staff in FY06 were not aligned with these priorities, having&#13;
instead the objective of raising awareness rather than building key skills.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Compounding this and despite the recognized efforts of many Regional and&#13;
Strategic Learning Center learning coordinators, internal formal staff learning remained&#13;
a low priority with front line managers. Moreover, the Bank's budget process was not&#13;
designed to deliver resources for learning where they were most needed, with all&#13;
Regions receiving the same notional share of budget for learning in their annual budget&#13;
envelope and most of this budget distributed to and managed by front-line units. Over&#13;
three-quarters of Regional learning resources were, de facto, not subject to Knowledge&#13;
and Learning Board (KLB) review or included in Knowledge and Learning (K&amp;L)&#13;
Plans.&#13;
&#13;
3.      This report examines the alignment of staff learning with World Bank business&#13;
priorities, and makes recommendations on how to improve alignment. The data&#13;
analyzed in this report come from (a) interviews with a random sample of Regional unit&#13;
managers, stratified by headquarters and country office and by Region, (b) a two-&#13;
question survey of the staff of those managers, (c) interviews with Learning&#13;
Coordinators from all Regions, all Network Anchors and designated other&#13;
representatives on the KLB, (d) Learning Management System (LMS) records of all&#13;
learning sessions for FY06 and FY07 as of May 1, 2007, (e) selected human resources'&#13;
data regarding learning participants, (f) Regional Strategy and Performance Contracts&#13;
for FY06 and FY07, (g) the World Bank Group Staff Survey of 2005, (h) K&amp;L Plans&#13;
for FY06, (i) quarterly staffing reports for FY06, and (j) background studies and reports.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The study concludes that staff learning is only partially aligned with corporate&#13;
and Regional priorities, and that major revisions in current practices will be required to&#13;
improve alignment considerably. The most essential will be to:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                              vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   · subject staff learning to the standard World Bank business processes for Work&#13;
       Program Agreements;&#13;
&#13;
   · consolidate learning into major programs for Professional and Technical and&#13;
       Operational learning;&#13;
&#13;
   · focus on more tailored approaches targeted at different groups of staff; and,&#13;
&#13;
   · utilize the learning budget more strategically through formula funding,&#13;
       conditional cash transfers, reduction in fungibility, and revision of learning&#13;
       fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
5.     It will also require some "quick fixes" to the LMS, to provide better user&#13;
interfaces for essential information and facilitate better targeting of learning&#13;
opportunities. A radical reform in terms of the governance of learning is also&#13;
suggested.&#13;

decentralization of the World Bank to over 100 country offices and increased reliance&#13;

1.2       Regional Managers expressed concern about shortcomings in staff professional&#13;
and technical expertise, absence of sensitivity to country context and political economy,&#13;
and lack of practical operational and implementation knowledge. Yet nearly half of&#13;
observable learning opportunities offered to and received by Regional staff in FY06&#13;
were not aligned with these priorities, having instead the objective of raising awareness&#13;
rather than building key skills (figure 1).2&#13;
&#13;
1.3       Compounding this and despite the recognized efforts of many Regional and&#13;
Strategic Learning Center (SLC) learning coordinators, formal internal staff learning&#13;
remained a low priority with front line managers. Consensus among managers is that&#13;
the best learning comes from interaction with peers and the mentoring of junior staff by&#13;
senior staff, particularly in the field. Managers also report that senior staff are best&#13;
served by external learning opportunities that maintain their professional and technical&#13;
expertise. Unit budgets for learning, however, are typically insufficient to support&#13;
much peer learning, senior staff on-the-job mentoring of junior staff, or external&#13;
professional and technical learning.&#13;

 1.4        The Bank's budget process is not designed to deliver resources for learning&#13;
 where they are most needed. All Regions receive the same notional share of budget for&#13;
 learning in their annual budget envelope, without regard to need. Charges against this&#13;
 budget can include Regional management of learning, creation and delivery of learning,&#13;
 and participation in learning (learning received). Resources for knowledge are managed&#13;
 separately. Approximately half of the observable costs for learning received are&#13;
 directed to raising awareness (figure 2).&#13;

 3In FY06, 2,832 sessions (including internal, external and on the job-learning) were recorded in the&#13;
 LMS. Out of them, 2,229 sessions (79 percent) were attended by at least one Regional staff member. All&#13;
 World Bank employees received 425,574 hours of learning, of which 196,423 hours (46 percent) were&#13;
 received by Regional staff members with regular, open and fixed term contracts.&#13;
 4Observable costs of learning received are those imputed to observable learning sessions on the basis of&#13;
 session duration and the average hourly wage rate of participants; they do not include development or&#13;
 delivery costs. For FY06, $3,882,151 was spent on raising awareness and $3,074,558 was spent on&#13;
 building staff capabilities. The report's data include Brown Bag Lunches (BBLs) recorded in the LMS.&#13;
 Excluding BBLs, the distribution of learning received (in hours and in cost) among raising awareness,&#13;
 building individual staff capabilities, building team effectiveness and developing leaders, remains&#13;
 equivalent.&#13;

of actionable recommendations: one set that the Knowledge and Learning Board (KLB)&#13;
could implement independently and a second set that would require the agreement of&#13;
the Resource and Performance Management Department (CSRRM). A third&#13;
recommendation, a radical reform of learning governance, is also described.&#13;

&#13;
2.1      We look for alignment in three dimensions: between Regional priorities and&#13;
Regional Knowledge and Learning Plans, between these plans and observed learning,&#13;
and between observed learning and Regional priorities. The two main sources for&#13;
information about Regional priorities are the Regional Strategy and Performance&#13;
Contract (SPC) and our interviews with a random sample of managers selected from&#13;
country offices and headquarters, who were asked to comment on the written document&#13;
and provide their own observations.&#13;
&#13;
Data sources&#13;
&#13;
2.2      Data analyzed in this report come from (a) interviews with a random sample of&#13;
Regional unit managers, stratified by headquarters (HQ) and country office (CO) and by&#13;
Region, (b) a two-question survey of the staff of those managers, (c) interviews with&#13;
Learning Coordinators from all Regions, all Network Anchors and designated other&#13;
representatives on the KLB, (d) Learning Management System (LMS) records of all&#13;

Regional Strategy and Performance Contracts identify staff skills as risk&#13;
&#13;
2.3      We examined Regional SPCs for FY06 (spring 2005) and FY07 (fall 2006), to&#13;
obtain an indication of Regional priorities, and--more importantly--the risks for&#13;
achieving these priorities as perceived by Regional management around FY06. In all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5The study focuses on learning of Regional staff for two reasons: they represent the core business of the&#13;
Bank, and they comprise over 50 percent of staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
six Regions, indicators of staff skills were rated as serious risks (defined as the impact&#13;
of the risk multiplied by its likelihood on scales of 1-9) for achieving Regional&#13;
objectives (see appendix A for details). For AFR, ECA, and SAR, no category was&#13;
given a higher risk rating than "staff skills and mix" (72, 56 and 56, respectively). For&#13;
all six Regions, indicators of "agility" (competitive positioning, responsiveness to&#13;
global developments, readiness for crisis assistance) were given risk ratings over 45.&#13;
For AFR, EAP, and SAR implementation skills (reliable procurement, disbursements,&#13;
implementation management, Trust Fund compliance, managing of projects with&#13;
complex safeguard issues) were rated 56 and in LCR implementation was rated over 45;&#13;
only in ECA were implementation issues not rated as risks. To place these ratings in&#13;
context, in LCR, MNA and SAR workplace security issues were accorded high risk&#13;
ratings (56, 63 and 56 respectively), and in LCR and MNA these issues were&#13;
paramount.&#13;
&#13;
2.4        In general, the interviewed managers agreed with the strategic priorities and the&#13;
performance risks as identified in the Regional SPCs. All interviewed HQ managers&#13;
and half of interviewed CO managers mentioned concerns related to shortcomings in&#13;
staff skills, in three main areas: (a) professional and technical (P&amp;T) expertise,&#13;
including sensitivity to the political economy of the country and ongoing global issues,&#13;
(b) practical operational knowledge, including project implementation skills, and (c)&#13;
communications skills and country knowledge needed for being effective on the ground&#13;
(table 3).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.5        With respect to professional and technical expertise, Regional managers&#13;
observed that senior staff working in middle-income countries (MICs) are often no&#13;
better informed on issues than their sophisticated counterparts, who may have attended&#13;
the same graduate programs in the United States or Europe as attended by Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In AFR and SAR, managers reported that junior staff needed basic sectoral learning.&#13;
Staff in LCR and AFR were seen as lacking in cross-regional experience; managers&#13;
viewed LCR staff as "insular" and staff in AFR as being "stuck" in the Region. In both&#13;
Regions, managers observed that clients could be better served by learning from&#13;
country experience outside the Region. In particular, knowledge and skill transfers&#13;
from MICs whose experience could be adapted to the low-income countries (LICs) and&#13;
from OECD countries whose experience could be adapted to MICs, would be valued in&#13;
several Regions.&#13;
&#13;
2.6     On the operational side, the principal observations were that countries value&#13;
knowledge about "how to do" rather than "what to do," and that junior task team leaders&#13;
(TTLs) lacked this practical knowledge, particularly about how to implement reforms.&#13;
In addition, managers noted that CO staff were less well socialized into Bank practices&#13;
and culture and often lacked the full range of Operational skills.&#13;
&#13;
2.7     Communication skills were consistently identified by CO managers as an issue.&#13;
They reported that some international staff lacked country knowledge and cultural&#13;
sensitivity, including the "soft skills" needed in MNA. The ability to deal with the&#13;
political economy was identified as a learning need in EAP, LCR, and SAR. Junior&#13;
TTLs, in particular, were identified as "too green" to engage in dialogue with&#13;
governments; they were viewed as technically proficient but lacking in knowledge of&#13;
the political economy of the country. In some Regions, the international language skills&#13;
(principally spoken and written English) of local staff were weak.&#13;
&#13;
FY06 Regional K&amp;L Plans lack specificity about learning programs&#13;
&#13;
2.8     No discussion of Regional K&amp;L Plans can begin without a discussion of the&#13;
budgets that support these plans. Budget allocations for learning are not strategic. All&#13;
Regions receive the same notional budget share for learning (approximately 3.9 percent)&#13;
and most of this budget is distributed to and managed by units. Over three-quarters of&#13;
Regional learning resources are, de facto, not subject to KLB review. Staff and&#13;
managers drive the bulk of learning in the Regions, and K&amp;L Plans play a small role.&#13;
&#13;
2.9     Regional K&amp;L Plans seem to apply only to the share of the Regional K&amp;L&#13;
budget that is managed by the Regional Learning Coordinator (RLC), which for FY06&#13;
ranged from less than 10 percent in AFR to nearly 40 percent in LCR and MNA&#13;
(figure 3). For ECA the share was 17 percent, and for EAP and SAR it was 25 percent.&#13;
This amount included resources for the RLC (salary, travel, support, and in some cases&#13;
evaluations) and to underwrite Regional learning activities including staff travel (in&#13;
SAR); staff-initiated "skills development grants" (in ECA); cross-sectoral, task or&#13;
country teams (LCR, ECA, MNA, SAR); and mentoring or coaching programs (in LCR,&#13;
EAP, ECA, MNA). In several Regions staff or units competed for resources. The&#13;
remainder of the learning budget, identified in the K&amp;L Plans for "individual learning"&#13;
(or "unallocated"), was typically distributed to units and managed by unit managers. In&#13;
all, therefore, 22 percent (about $7 million) of the Regional learning budget was subject&#13;
to KLB review and/or authorization.&#13;

&#13;
2.10    Consistent with their control of 60-90 percent of the Regional learning budget,&#13;
unit managers view their staff and themselves as primarily responsible for determining&#13;
how knowledge and learning resources are used, and note that most decisions regarding&#13;
resource use are in response to staff initiatives (appendix C). Indeed, managers--other&#13;
than those with direct involvement in Regional Learning Committees--do not view the&#13;
Regional Learning Coordinators as influential with regard to staff learning. Managers&#13;
report interest in distributing resources "fairly" and often establish unit learning&#13;
committees to decide on the use of the unit-level learning budget, which is small,&#13;
averaging $40,000-$100,000 depending on the number of staff. Some managers note&#13;
that staff travel associated with periodic sectoral events held in Washington (e.g.,&#13;
PREM Learning Forum, Financial Management ­ Fiduciary Forum) use all their&#13;
variable cost budget for learning. Managers of small remote COs view the learning&#13;
budget as insufficient, particularly to cover travel to Washington or Regional hubs for&#13;
learning, whereas CO managers in hubs (such as Bangkok) view staff time as a major&#13;
impediment to learning. HQ managers also view staff time, rather than budget, as a&#13;
concern.&#13;
&#13;
2.11    In determining how to use the FY06 budget, Regional Learning Coordinators&#13;
undertook serious efforts to develop K&amp;L Plans in coordination with Regional&#13;
Management Teams (RMTs). This involved staff surveys, one-on-one meetings with&#13;
staff, meetings with Country and Sector Directors and Managers, reviews of staffing by&#13;
unit, reviews of past learning of staff and the active involvement of Regional Learning&#13;
Committees. In Regions where the Regional Learning Coordinator was a member of&#13;
the RMT, this process was facilitated by regular contact with members of the RMT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.12     Clarifying alignment between the resulting plans and Regional strategies and&#13;
performance risks is difficult, because the descriptions of the strategic focus/priority&#13;
areas for Regional FY06 K&amp;L Plans are typically comprehensive, but rarely indicate&#13;
detailed content for the learning program. Rather, lists of anticipated courses are&#13;
provided, and in many cases, only the modality of learning, rather than its content, is&#13;
described (see table 4 for examples). One exception to this observation is the reference&#13;
to building team effectiveness, which occurs in all K&amp;L Plans. Moreover, the K&amp;L&#13;
Plans are viewed as "living" documents, subject to change as the fiscal year progresses&#13;
and responsive to unanticipated requests from managers.&#13;

2.13     K&amp;L Plans for FY06 did not consistently indicate how learning resources were&#13;
to be allocated across priorities or activities, and most of the activities listed in the plans&#13;
did not have costs associated with them. For example, the AFR plan called for $9.6&#13;
million for learning, including $780,000 reserved for Regional activities, of which the&#13;
lion's share ($700,000) was allocated to the Regional operational learning course,&#13;
Assuring the Quality of Bank-Assisted Operations in Africa. The rest ($8.9 million)&#13;
was designated as "unallocated" and apparently programmed at the unit level.&#13;
&#13;
2.14     Many weaknesses in the FY06 K&amp;L Plans were to have been repaired in FY07,&#13;
and these comments apply only to the FY06 plans. What is clear, however, is that the&#13;
Regional learning programs only partially addressed the risks identified in the SPCs and&#13;
further elaborated by the Regional managers. As an example, implementation of&#13;
operations was notably absent from the list of SPC performance risks in ECA, and&#13;
managers emphasized the need for new, cutting edge P&amp;T skills and expertise. Yet&#13;
about one-third of the Regional learning budget was allocated to courses devoted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
operations and project implementation, for which only half the expected participants&#13;
showed up, suggesting a supply that was not aligned with demand. By comparison, a&#13;
well-regarded learning program on a new P&amp;T topic, "Regional development," was&#13;
oversubscribed, with nearly 350 participants.&#13;
&#13;
A glass half full: Learning received is only partially aligned with corporate&#13;
priorities&#13;
&#13;
2.15    The literature identifies four major objectives of staff learning: raising staff&#13;
awareness, building individual staff capabilities, building team effectiveness and&#13;
developing leaders (Lockheed and Arango 2005). In the World Bank, typical activities&#13;
to build awareness include the orientation program for new staff, sector forums and&#13;
professional and technical (P&amp;T) brown bag lunches. Activities to build staff&#13;
capabilities include formal courses such as Fundamentals of Bank Operations, and other&#13;
non-course approaches, such as on-the-job training or mentoring. Team effectiveness is&#13;
built through programs that directly support teams, such as the Multi-sectoral Team&#13;
Learning Program. Leaders are developed through formal courses and coaching.&#13;
Regional SPCs and managers emphasize the importance of building staff capabilities&#13;
for carrying out operational responsibilities and for engaging in professional and&#13;
technical dialogue with clients.&#13;
&#13;
2.16    Analyses of the observed learning received by all Regional staff in FY06 find&#13;
that the learning sessions received by Regional staff were only partially aligned with the&#13;
Regional risks and weaknesses in staff skills as identified by managers (see appendix D&#13;
for observed learning hours for specific topics). Specifically, the following suggest&#13;
misalignment:&#13;
&#13;
    · Nearly half of learning received was for raising awareness (accounting for 46&#13;
        percent of learning sessions and 44 percent of total observed learning hours).&#13;
&#13;
    · About half of learning received had the objective of building staff capabilities&#13;
        (50 percent of sessions and 44 percent of observed learning hours).&#13;
&#13;
    · Building team effectiveness was the objective of less than 10 percent of learning&#13;
        (3 percent of sessions and under 10 percent of learning hours).&#13;
&#13;
    · Most activities designed to build staff capabilities were not differentiated&#13;
        according to level (introductory, intermediate, advanced) to facilitate&#13;
        appropriate targeting of staff.&#13;
&#13;
    · Very little learning to build staff capabilities related to the corporate topic of&#13;
        governance and anti-corruption (less than half a percent of learning hours).&#13;
&#13;
    · Very little learning focused on other Regional priorities; only a few recorded&#13;
        sessions dealt with issues of political economy, and none dealt with issues of&#13;
        "agility" in responding to changes in country conditions or requests from&#13;
        governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.17      In other respects, however, learning was well aligned with corporate priorities.&#13;
&#13;
    · Nearly half of learning for building staff capabilities focused on Bank&#13;
          operations skills (41 percent); the remainder focused on professional and&#13;
          technical skills (21 percent), communications skills (17 percent), IT skills (14&#13;
          percent), resource management skills (4 percent), and other various skills (3&#13;
          percent).6&#13;
&#13;
    · Among Bank operational skills, the most frequently learned involve procurement&#13;
          and portfolio management.&#13;
&#13;
    · Among professional and technical skills, the most frequently learned involve&#13;
          monitoring and evaluation and economics.&#13;
&#13;
    · Learning activities received by country office staff are more likely to focus on&#13;
          building staff skills and less likely to focus on raising awareness, and are twice&#13;
          as likely to focus on building operational skills, as compared with learning&#13;
          activities received by headquarters staff (see appendix E for details).&#13;
&#13;
    · Ethics is a major topic of learning for raising awareness. Ethics awareness&#13;
          comprises 8 percent of learning for raising awareness; only rural development&#13;
          and procurement receive more hours of learning.&#13;
&#13;
    · Governance/anti-corruption is a topic of learning for raising awareness,&#13;
          accounting for nearly 3 percent of learning hours received for raising awareness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6Communication skills include country knowledge and cultural sensitivity, ability to deal with the&#13;
political economy, engaging in dialogue with clients, conveying messages effectively and written and&#13;
spoken language skills (including English).&#13;

 3. WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE GLASS HALF EMPTY?&#13;
&#13;
3.1     Misalignment may arise from the governance of learning; difficulty staff and&#13;
managers face in obtaining information about the quality, relevance and availability of&#13;
learning opportunities; the weakness of the LMS for use as an accountability tool;&#13;
failures of staff to register some team and individual learning in the LMS; and other&#13;
impediments as identified by managers and prior studies.&#13;
&#13;
Governance of learning is multi-layered and transaction intensive&#13;
&#13;
3.2     Governance of staff learning is complex and inconsistent across Regions in&#13;
terms of organizational form, strategies used to identify staff learning needs, and degree&#13;
of cooperation with other Regions and SLCs. A visible difference among the Regions&#13;
is the seniority of the "learning coordinator" and his or her organizational proximity to&#13;
the Regional Management Team (RMT) or Vice President's (VP) office. ECA's&#13;
Regional Learning Coordinator (RLC) reports directly to the VP, EAP's RLC reports&#13;
through one administrative level, while the RLCs in AFR, LCR, MNA and SAR report&#13;
through at least two levels of administration (see appendix F). Moreover, multiple&#13;
learning committees operate within Regions, typically beginning at the unit level and&#13;
culminating at the level of the VPU front office. In addition, Regional sector managers&#13;
and directors serve on sector boards and councils, respectively, which authorize sector&#13;
learning programs.&#13;
&#13;
3.3     While RLCs strive to ensure alignment of learning with corporate priorities at&#13;
least on the portion of the budget that they oversee, managers in all Regions attribute to&#13;
themselves and their staff the greatest influence over the production and utilization of&#13;
learning opportunities, with Sector Boards being a distant second for all but advisory&#13;
services (figure 4 and appendix C).&#13;
&#13;
3.4     Standard procedures for identifying staff learning needs and ensuring that&#13;
learning responds to these needs are lacking. RLCs engage in a wide range of&#13;
approaches for identifying learning needs. Strategies mentioned by RLCs include (a)&#13;
conducting "needs assessments" via surveys and one-on-one meetings with staff, (b)&#13;
reviewing corporate priorities such as "governance and anti-corruption" or "results" and&#13;
focusing on these areas, (c) reviewing human resources' data to focus on new local staff&#13;
with orientation and operations courses, (d) reviewing the staff survey results, (e)&#13;
meeting with Regional directors with lists of new staff that have not received training,&#13;
(f) consulting with the Operations Policy and Country Services vice presidency (OPCS)&#13;
on operational learning, and (g) creating a database on all Regional staff and training&#13;
received. These strategies are used in various combinations.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.5                    Cooperation between Regions and other SLCs varies considerably across the&#13;
Bank. RLCs attributed lack of cooperation to (a) the number of units that "own" certain&#13;
topics (e.g., governance, results, evaluation), (b) the absence of a formal coordinating&#13;
mechanism including some means for sharing "visibility" for learning, (c) personalities&#13;
and "ownership" by certain Regional staff of certain topics, and (d) differences among&#13;
Regions with respect to importance of various topics. Successful examples of&#13;
cooperation were mentioned, particularly for cross-regional cost sharing on specific&#13;
topics.&#13;
&#13;
Identifying good available learning opportunities can be difficult&#13;
&#13;
3.6                    Numerous learning opportunities are advertised daily to managers and staff&#13;
alike. Faced with this amount of information, some managers expressed the need to&#13;
know which learning opportunities--internal or external--would be valuable to their&#13;
staff. To reduce the amount of messages and help staff plan their learning, some groups&#13;
(e.g., Asia Learning, Information Solutions Network) advertise events monthly.&#13;
Nevertheless, the large volume of messages offering learning opportunities impedes&#13;
strategic choices.&#13;
&#13;
3.7                    Given the abundance of learning opportunity information, a good Learning&#13;
Management System is needed to help managers, learning coordinators, and staff make&#13;
strategic decisions about learning. However, searching activities in the LMS can be&#13;
cumbersome and misleading. Getting a calendar of upcoming events sorted by dates is&#13;
not possible. Additional issues with the search functions of the LMS are described in&#13;
appendix H.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The LMS is an inappropriate tool for accountability&#13;
&#13;
3.8       As a tool for accountability, the LMS is not viewed positively by either&#13;
managers or learning coordinators. It is viewed as "user-unfriendly" and as a&#13;
consequence it remains an underutilized tool. Comments were decidedly negative.&#13;
Managers and learning coordinators cannot easily extract the training history of staff.&#13;
They rely on the KLB secretariat to provide data that they want to query on their own&#13;
for just-in-time use. Once provided, the data are often seen as too unreliable to be used.&#13;
Appendix H details issues that make the LMS a poor accountability tool.&#13;
&#13;
3.9       The LMS has earned such a poor reputation as an accountability tool that some&#13;
managers and learning coordinators try to avoid using it. In response to the&#13;
shortcomings of the LMS, some Regional Learning Coordinators have even established&#13;
their own local database to provide them with the staff learning information they need,&#13;
such as the training history of staff in their Regions, and to monitor the learning budget.&#13;
&#13;
Some learning is not recorded&#13;
&#13;
3.10      Some observed misalignment may be due to failures in registering learning in&#13;
the LMS and in constraints imposed by higher managers. One indication that learning&#13;
is not recorded adequately is that it is difficult in the LMS to account for the entire&#13;
Regional budget allocation (table 5).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 Consultants, temporaries and Junior Professional Associates (JPAs) were excluded from our main&#13;
analysis. However, in table 5 to provide a conservative estimate of the unexplained budget allocation we&#13;
included them as follows. For short-term consultants and temporaries, LMS participant's hours were&#13;
multiplied by the participant's actual hourly wage rate. For extended term consultants and temporaries,&#13;
we applied the distribution by grade group of the regional staff to impute their participation costs. For&#13;
JPAs, we used the net market reference point-hourly wage rate of Grade D staff.&#13;
8 When the country of delivery of a face-to-face learning session was different from the country of duty of&#13;
the staff member, we assumed that the staff member spent two days (16 hours) traveling for this learning&#13;
session. To compute the cost of this traveling time, we multiplied the net market reference point-hourly&#13;
wage rate by 16.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.11    In table 5, the imputed staff time cost of learning recorded in the LMS accounts&#13;
for approximately 24 percent of FY06 allocation and an additional 4 percent could be&#13;
explained by the time of temporaries, consultants and Junior Professional Associates&#13;
(JPA) assuming that they were paid for attending the learning sessions. The cost of&#13;
participants' travel and the estimated cost of participant staff travel time to and back&#13;
from the training account for 17 percent and 11 percent respectively. Another 23&#13;
percent correspond to the Regional learning development and delivery costs. This&#13;
analysis leaves a conservative estimate of 22 percent of the budget allocation to all&#13;
Regions unexplained, possibly in part a consequence of failures in recording&#13;
participation.&#13;
&#13;
3.12    Participation under-recording is particularly relevant to peer learning. Managers&#13;
observed that on-the-job learning from more knowledgeable and experienced peers is&#13;
universally valued; they provided several examples. Staff agreed (appendix G); among&#13;
staff surveyed, 46 percent reported that they learned on the job from a colleague and/or&#13;
had participated in a group peer learning program; this was second only to reading a&#13;
study, operational guide or knowledge website (49 percent). This learning is often not&#13;
captured in the LMS; for example, only 9 percent of the same staff had their peer&#13;
learning recorded in the LMS.9 In addition, some types of team learning organized at&#13;
the country office unit level, including "retreats" or "study tours" to visit projects under&#13;
implementation, were administratively curtailed, according to several managers.&#13;
&#13;
What managers see as impediments to learning&#13;
&#13;
3.13    Misalignment may be due to constraints on Regional staff. Country managers&#13;
identified three main impediments for learning: (a) distance (in time zones and travel&#13;
time) between the CO and HQ or Regional hubs, (b) demands on staff time for&#13;
operational work, and (c) in a few cases, staff lack of familiarity and comfort with&#13;
distance learning (e-learning and video-conferencing). Budget was rarely mentioned as&#13;
a defining impediment, although it was an issue in three cases. First, small, remote COs&#13;
found that the unit budget for learning was too small to allow for much staff travel.&#13;
Second, for the years in which major sectoral events (such as sector forums) occurred,&#13;
travel budgets for sectoral staff were viewed as insufficient. Third, budgets were&#13;
generally viewed as insufficient for obtaining senior level staff (or retiree) mentors for&#13;
junior TTLs.&#13;
&#13;
3.14    Another source of misalignment may come from staff motivation for learning.&#13;
Staff ratings for learning sessions are generally positive, but relatively low with respect&#13;
to relevance to their present job (Ling, Dasgupta, and Yenice 2006). It may be that&#13;
career development rather than job performance is the main incentive for learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9The period observed in the survey and the corresponding LMS data cover FY06 and the first ten months&#13;
of FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                          4. RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
4.1     Alignment of staff learning with corporate and Regional priorities can be&#13;
considerably improved with a number of major revisions in current practices. The most&#13;
essential will be to subject staff learning to the standard Bank business processes for&#13;
Work Program Agreements, consolidate learning into major programs, and focus on&#13;
more tailored approaches targeted at different groups of staff. It will also require some&#13;
LMS fixes, to provide better user interfaces for essential information and facilitate&#13;
better targeting of learning opportunities. A radical reform in terms of the governance&#13;
of learning is also suggested.&#13;
&#13;
4.2     The following "basket" of learning, tailored to staff job responsibilities, would&#13;
improve learning alignment with Regional corporate priorities:&#13;
&#13;
    · For ACS and local staff, continuous updating on Bank operational skills&#13;
        (portfolio management, procurement, etc.) and Bank policies, largely through e-&#13;
        learning&#13;
&#13;
    · For junior task team leaders (TTLs), (a) coaching by senior staff on political&#13;
        economy and project implementation, within the country context, (b) a standard&#13;
        TTL learning program (expanding on Fundamental of Bank Operations) across&#13;
        Regions, and (c) introductory P&amp;T learning through sectoral "flagship" courses&#13;
        or externally provided courses&#13;
&#13;
    · For senior experts, particularly for those working with MIC clients, professional&#13;
        expertise enhancement through external learning&#13;
&#13;
    · For international staff moving to COs, pre-departure learning on country and&#13;
        culture.&#13;
&#13;
4.3     The challenge is how to achieve this "basket" in the absence of clear budget&#13;
authority and incentives for implementation or compliance. The following&#13;
recommendations include those that can be achieved without changes in budget&#13;
management as well as those that would require coordination with Resource and&#13;
Performance Management Department (CSRRM).&#13;
&#13;
Actionable recommendations not requiring changes in budget management&#13;
&#13;
4.4     The following are recommendations that the KLB could decide to implement&#13;
independently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
KLB actions to improve targeting and alignment of learning&#13;
&#13;
  · Eliminate "open enrollment" for most face-to-face learning opportunities other&#13;
     than BBLs.&#13;
&#13;
  · Use LMS and HR data to identify staff movement (from HQ to CO, CO to HQ,&#13;
     from one position to another) and provide staff, managers and RLCs with a list&#13;
     of learning aligned with the requirements of the new position.&#13;
&#13;
  · Target junior task team leaders for TTL learning and sectoral P&amp;T courses&#13;
     (including "canned" courses and those provided outside the Bank).&#13;
&#13;
  · Schedule longer formal courses for the first two quarters of the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to improve business processes for learning&#13;
&#13;
  · Improve transparency, by (a) sending a Learning Dashboard to Regional VPs to&#13;
     document learning received and resources spent, and (b) sending summary unit&#13;
     data on learning received and resources spent to managers and staff of Regional&#13;
     units and to the Regional Learning Coordinator.&#13;
&#13;
  · Follow the World Bank's standard business processes for review and approval of&#13;
     learning programs, i.e., concept note, review meeting, Work Program&#13;
     Agreement (WPA).&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to improve P&amp;T skills alignment with business priorities&#13;
&#13;
  · Differentiate courses by level, i.e., basic, intermediate, and advanced. (OPCS&#13;
     does this already in their "roadmap.")&#13;
&#13;
  · Identify new learning opportunities for advanced P&amp;T (through partnerships&#13;
     with universities, think tanks, etc.); RLCs could identify decentralized&#13;
     opportunities and Network Anchors could identify international opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
  · Commission a study group to examine how to respond to learning needs on&#13;
     "political economy" and country context.&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to improve operational skills alignment with business priorities&#13;
&#13;
  · OPCS and the Learning Support Group should expand the number of short,&#13;
     online or CD-ROM based courses for specific operations skills (procurement,&#13;
     supervision, disbursement, etc) with regular (at least annual) updates to keep&#13;
     current with operational requirements. (Financial Management does some of&#13;
     this already.)&#13;
&#13;
  · Establish a "Senior Operations Specialist" fund to support on-mission mentoring&#13;
     of junior TTLs by senior TTLs (possibly those 60 or older).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Establish peer learning and mentoring awards as incentives.&#13;
&#13;
    · Load non-course/event learning tools into the LMS (e.g., self-assessments,&#13;
       checklists, etc).&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to make the LMS more user-friendly (Appendix H details all LMS&#13;
recommendations.)&#13;
&#13;
    · Create user-friendly search tools and reports to provide unit managers with&#13;
       information on staff learning history and plans.&#13;
&#13;
    · Create user-friendly interfaces for staff to easily find relevant learning&#13;
       opportunities and sort them by dates.&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to use LMS more strategically&#13;
&#13;
    · Send managers (with copy to the RLC) a quarterly email list of their staff with&#13;
       (a) their past learning received, (b) suggestions for their next learning, linked to&#13;
       upcoming events, (c) links to the unit's manager reports to enable autonomous&#13;
       just-in-time monitoring, and (d) links to tutorials for managers and staff to find&#13;
       and enter information in the LMS.&#13;
&#13;
KLB actions to improve LMS data&#13;
&#13;
    · Better define the target audience by (a) replacing the field "grade groups" and&#13;
       "HR manager flag" with "function," (b) adding "intact team" versus "individual"&#13;
       learning, and (c) specifying CO/HQ target differently.&#13;
&#13;
    · Better define the activity content by (a) mandating the completion of the&#13;
       "learning objectives" field in a structured results-oriented format, and (b)&#13;
       differentiating all activities by difficulty levels (i.e., introductory, intermediate,&#13;
       and advanced).&#13;
&#13;
    · Capture in the LMS sessions that would otherwise be unrecorded, by enabling&#13;
       learners to add sessions that they attended but that were not recorded in the&#13;
       LMS, thereby creating a flag prompting the retrospective entry of sessions in the&#13;
       LMS.&#13;
&#13;
    · Add a field to the LMS to identify peer learning or mentoring providers (name&#13;
       of staff).&#13;
&#13;
    · After fixing the LMS, communicate all improvements to users to rebuild their&#13;
       trust in using the system's data.&#13;
&#13;
Actionable items requiring agreement of CSRRM&#13;
&#13;
4.5    The following recommendations should help improve the strategic use of&#13;
learning budget. If the variable cost learning budget were managed by the Chief&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Learning Officer's office (rather than included in each Region's budget envelope from&#13;
CSRRM), alignment with corporate priorities could be improved. Some alternatives to&#13;
consider are:&#13;
&#13;
    · Formula funding of variable cost budget: Allocate unit funding for learning&#13;
        based on a formula that takes into account such factors as (a) travel cost to HQ&#13;
        or Regional hub, (b) time zone distance and overlap with HQ, (c) internet&#13;
        connectivity speed at office, (d) access to GDLN/videoconferencing service, (e)&#13;
        share of new and/or junior staff, (f) number of peers in CO to provide peer&#13;
        learning, (g) country governance index, etc.&#13;
&#13;
    · Conditional cash transfers: Distribute budgets to units on the basis of quarterly&#13;
        performance measures based on observed staff learning participation in&#13;
        activities for which they match the target audience, up to the limit of the budget&#13;
        envelope.&#13;
&#13;
    · Reduce fungibility of learning budgets by: (a) limiting use of learning budgets to&#13;
        pay for staff participating in learning (allow limited use of Regional training&#13;
        development/delivery budget to adapt--not reinvent--programs, (b) limiting&#13;
        use of SLC budgets to design and delivery of learning (except for their units'&#13;
        budgets for staff learning), and (c) monitoring WPAs for compliance.&#13;
&#13;
    · Change the fiscal year for learning: A learning fiscal year aligned with the&#13;
        calendar year would reduce many of the time conflicts for staff and could&#13;
        impose greater discipline on learning providers to develop most learning in the&#13;
        first two quarters of the Bank's fiscal year. A first step is to develop an 18-&#13;
        month WPA covering fiscal year 2008 and calendar year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
A radical reform specific to governance&#13;
&#13;
4.6     A change in learning governance might be in order. This could involve the&#13;
creation, in each Region, of a small "Learning Unit" (and Learning Manager) that would&#13;
be responsible for staff learning and that would manage the entire Regional budget for&#13;
learning (that is, the entire 3.9 percent received by Regions for this purpose). Learning&#13;
deliverables would be organized into programs and segmented by targeted staff.&#13;
Learning Units would follow standard budget procedures for monitoring the progress of&#13;
these programs (e.g., identification, concept note review, draft review of learning&#13;
content, delivery to country or sector client, evaluation, and implementation report).&#13;
The scale of learning resources at the Regional level (an average of about $5 million per&#13;
Region) would justify the creation of such small specialized units for learning. Activity&#13;
Initiation Summaries (AISs) would be created in SAP for each learning program (not&#13;
activity) with specific deliveries identified. Since the Learning Unit would manage the&#13;
budget, the Regional managers would not have the incentive to use the learning budget&#13;
for non-learning purposes or as rewards to staff.&#13;
&#13;
4.7     Learning Units would serve as brokers, but would neither create nor deliver&#13;
learning opportunities. Instead, Learning Units would enter into contracts with Country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
or Sector units to deliver a set of products that would be aligned with the country or&#13;
sector strategies, and into contracts with Network Anchors, other SLCs or outside&#13;
vendors to develop and deliver the learning sessions called for in the Country or Sector&#13;
unit contracts. Since the Learning Units would not design or deliver learning, they&#13;
would not have an incentive to use the learning budget to "reinvent the wheel," which&#13;
should reduce the number of nearly identical learning offerings.&#13;

Note: Risk ratings are obtained by multiplying "potential impact" with "likelihood of adverse outcomes."&#13;
Both risk elements are rated on an ascending 10-point scale. Thus, the highest possible risk rating is 100.&#13;
In each category the chart indicates the highest risk rating between FY06 and FY07.&#13;

Note: Managers were asked "Who decides how Knowledge and Learning resources are used? Please indicate the&#13;
MOST influential person or group and the SECOND MOST influential person or group for each decision listed below."&#13;
Each manager was accorded two votes per decision (that is, no distinction was made between the most influential and&#13;
the second most influential). Votes of managers who cast only one vote were doubled (e.g., if a manager voted for one&#13;
decision maker, that decision maker was accorded two votes). Votes of managers who cast more than two votes were&#13;
weighted by the inverse of the number of votes they cast (e.g., if a manager voted for four decision makers, each&#13;
decision maker was accorded 0.5 votes (2/4)); "other" is omitted. High is defined as 10.5 votes or more; medium is&#13;
defined as 3.0 &lt; 10.5; low is defined as &lt; 3. Three managers did not complete the question.&#13;

APPENDIX E: LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF LMS DATA&#13;
                            FOR SIX REGIONS, FY06&#13;
&#13;
The following analysis is based on all LMS data for staff working in the six Regional&#13;
VPUs. Activities were coded into four broad categories based on their objectives:&#13;
raising staff awareness, building individual staff capabilities, building team&#13;
effectiveness and developing leaders. Within each of these categories, specific&#13;
objectives were identified (for example, ethics awareness, P&amp;T skills) and further&#13;
refinements made where appropriate. We then examined the probability of participating&#13;
in various activities, according to staff Region, country office (vs. headquarters), grade&#13;
group, and years at the Bank (table A.E.2). A further analysis was undertaken for&#13;
activities for building individual capabilities specifically (table A.E.3).&#13;
&#13;
Regions differ in their attention to raising awareness, building individual capabilities,&#13;
building team effectiveness and developing leaders. Staff in EAP, LCR and SAR are&#13;
more likely and staff in MNA are less likely to participate in awareness activities than&#13;
staff AFR or ECA. Staff in AFR and MNA are more likely to participate in activities to&#13;
build skills compared with staff in other Regions. Staff in ECA are three times as likely&#13;
to engage in activities to enhance team effectiveness than staff in AFR, those in MNA&#13;
are half more likely to, while those in EAP and SAR are less likely to do so. Leadership&#13;
development is largely unrelated to Region, but staff in LCR are 80 percent more likely&#13;
to engaged in leadership development than staff in AFR, and staff in MNA are 70&#13;
percent more likely to do so.&#13;
&#13;
Among staff who participate in activities designed to build their capabilities, those&#13;
working in AFR, MNA or SAR are more likely to focus on building operational skills,&#13;
as compared with staff in EAP, ECA or LCR, for whom the odds are much lower. Staff&#13;
working in SAR have lower odds of learning related to P&amp;T skills, and staff in EAP,&#13;
LCR and SAR have higher odds of learning related to communication, when compared&#13;
with staff in other Regions.&#13;
&#13;
Country office staff, when compared with headquarters staff are half as likely to&#13;
participate in awareness activities and over twice as likely to participate in those that&#13;
build skills. CO staff are 40 percent more likely to participate in activities to develop&#13;
leadership. Location is not related to the probability of participating in activities to&#13;
build team effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Among staff who participate in activities designed to build capabilities, CO staff are&#13;
twice as likely to focus on building Operational Skills compared with HQ staff.&#13;
However, CO staff are significantly less likely to participate in activities related to other&#13;
major areas of capability: P&amp;T skills, resource management skills, administrative skills,&#13;
or IT skills.&#13;
&#13;
Staff grade groups--and hence job descriptions--are strongly related to the odds of&#13;
participating in various types of learning. Staff levels GE and above are significantly&#13;
more likely to participate in learning activities to build awareness than are GA-GD staff,&#13;
whereas GA-GD staff are significantly more likely to participate in learning activities to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
build their skills. Staff levels GF and above are more likely to participate in learning&#13;
activities to build team effectiveness and those in levels GG and above are more likely&#13;
to participate in leadership development activities. Among staff who participate in&#13;
activities designed to build capabilities, staff levels GE and above are much more likely&#13;
to engage in learning about P&amp;T skills, operational skills, and resource management,&#13;
and less likely to engage in learning about administrative skills, IT skills or&#13;
communications, as compared with those in levels GA-GD.&#13;
&#13;
Grade group by location interactions: Country office staff in levels GF and GG are&#13;
twice as likely to engage in learning about operations, compared with other staff, and&#13;
are about half as likely to engage in P&amp;T and communications learning activities.&#13;

     APPENDIX H: LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LMS&#13;
&#13;
This appendix highlights a series of issues and provides actionable recommendations&#13;
related to making the Learning Management System a more useful tool to align staff&#13;
learning strategically. The tables below are the result of a diagnostic of the LMS&#13;
functions as of May and June 2007. This exercise uncovered other issues not listed&#13;
here, as these are less relevant to the topic of this report. The appendix focuses on&#13;
functions for two types of users of the LMS, i.e., learners and managers. When&#13;
functions for course administrators affect the information for learners, the&#13;
recommendations also covered the screens completed by course administrators. In each&#13;
table the recommendations are organized around three types of actions: (a) providing&#13;
relevant information to help managers and learners use the LMS strategically, (b)&#13;
making the LMS more user-friendly, and (c) fixing malfunctions.&#13;
&#13;
      Functions for learners and background functions for course administrators&#13;
&#13;
                       Issues                                           Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Providing relevant information clearly&#13;
&#13;
Target audience by functions:                          Replace the target audience field "HR manager flag"&#13;
Learning activities are often designed around          and "grade group" with the "function" with the&#13;
people's functions. Yet, the LMS does not have a       following values: managers (higher level), task team&#13;
target audience field by function. Instead the LMS     leaders, other higher level staff, office managers, and&#13;
uses two proxy fields, grade groups and "HR            ACS staff.&#13;
manager flag." While both fields jointly provide an&#13;
indication of the function, indicating the target&#13;
audience directly by functions would be simpler&#13;
and more relevant. For example, a course&#13;
administrator may select GF-GG as a grade group&#13;
to indicate that the course is for TTLs. GE TTLs&#13;
may miss it in a search by grade, while GF non-&#13;
TTLs may return this course in their search.&#13;
&#13;
Specify HQ/CO target audience differently: The         Eliminate the HQ/CO target audience field. The&#13;
LMS recently added a HQ/CO target audience             country of delivery (a useful recent addition to the&#13;
field. Identifying activities for CO staff is useful,  LMS search) or the online delivery mode (if canned&#13;
but the field is used inconsistently and can           or with moderation on their time zone) are better&#13;
confuse learners who search through this field.        means of signaling to CO staff which activities are&#13;
Some course administrators tag HQ activities both      designed for them.&#13;
HQ and CO, because CO staff are welcome to&#13;
attend, if they happen to be in HQ. Learners in&#13;
COs find these activities in searching for CO&#13;
activities. Conversely, tagging HQ activities for&#13;
HQ only may signal to CO based learner that s/he&#13;
is not the target audience, even if s/he happens to&#13;
be at HQ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CO is not a specific location. Bangkok sessions&#13;
are irrelevant to Dakar-based staff.&#13;
&#13;

                         Issues                                         Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Target individuals vs. intact teams:                  Add to the session screen: "Is this session for intact&#13;
A major difference in target audiences is             teams?" yes or no.&#13;
individuals versus intact team. Yet, the LMS does&#13;
not have a field distinguishing these types of        Next to this question, add an information icon that&#13;
audience.                                             specifies: "Click yes if the session is specifically for&#13;
                                                      participants who work together outside of the&#13;
                                                      learning session. If participants need not be related&#13;
                                                      to each other, click no."&#13;
&#13;
Make target information search precise:               Make the search return only activities tagged&#13;
All categories of target audience and course          specifically with the selection criterion, i.e., the&#13;
difficulty level are selected by the course           course administrator did not select at least one of the&#13;
administrator as multiple-choice options. Many        options available in the field.&#13;
activities are tagged with all choices available.&#13;
                                                      In the course administrator's activity detail screen,&#13;
Learners select a search criterion because it         add an information icon next to the categorical target&#13;
matters to them. They would expect to find only       fields explaining the consequences of selecting all&#13;
activities meeting their search criteria. However,    choices available when learners search by this field.&#13;
they also find activities for which all choices were&#13;
tagged, making the list needlessly long and           In the learner's advanced search screen, add an&#13;
potentially misleading. For example, a learner        information icon next to the categorical target fields&#13;
who searched for introductory activities may          explaining that specifying a criterion will only return&#13;
assume that all activities returned by the search     the activities that specifically met the criterion. If a&#13;
are introductory, but some activities are tagged      learner wants to find activities that may or may not&#13;
with all levels of difficulty.                        meet the criterion, s/he should not search by this&#13;
                                                      criterion.&#13;
&#13;
Rename the difficulty level categories:               Rename the difficulty level categories "introductory,"&#13;
The activities have recently been classified in the   "intermediate," and "advanced."&#13;
LMS as "introductory," "advanced," and/or "cutting&#13;
edge." However, "cutting edge" relates to a&#13;
concept different from "introductory "and&#13;
"advanced." A topic can be cutting edge and&#13;
treated at an introductory level. Conversely, a&#13;
long-established topic can be taught at an&#13;
advanced level. Therefore, the categories are not&#13;
clearly mutually exclusive.&#13;
&#13;
Enable search by duration: Duration matters to        In the advanced search screen, add a field to enable&#13;
learners who search for learning opportunities.       the search of activities by duration ranges.&#13;
Yet, the LMS search screens does not enables&#13;
learners to search activities by duration.&#13;

delivery. This is great progress, particularly for&#13;
CO staff. However, from the current LMS,&#13;
learners do not know the precise location of a&#13;

sessions of an activity are only offered the choice&#13;
to enroll in a session. There is no exit button, and&#13;
the Internet "back" button generally gives error&#13;
messages. Then, learners need to rebuild their&#13;

in the target audience or difficulty level fields,    administrator selected all available options.&#13;
each option is displayed in the activity description&#13;

Making the LMS more user-friendly&#13;
&#13;
Save default queries: To busy managers, the             1.  Create a default query based on the manager's&#13;
reports may look cumbersome to build. A manager             unit, grade, and number of days spent in&#13;
is most likely to query his unit. Yet, the default unit     learning.&#13;
value is blank. Once a manager builds a query           2.  Enable a manager to save queries, including&#13;
s/he is likely to monitor the same data in the future,      saving a customized query as default.&#13;
but the queries cannot be saved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10The LMS should enable staff to exclude some training from their learning records. For example, some&#13;
staff may not want to attend training about harassment, if managers receive this information.&#13;

&#13;
Improve the ILP view: The Individual Learning          1.  Enable ILP sorts by displayed fields.&#13;
Plan's view is confusing. The records are              2.  Put the date and location in separate fields to&#13;
displayed in an unfriendly manner. Over time, ILPs         enable sorting by date.&#13;
display more and more records. Newer records&#13;
appear at the bottom, sometimes hidden in the          3.  Give the option to hide the location. The room&#13;
&#13;
collapsed section.                                         number is an unimportant piece of information&#13;
                                                           that clutters the ILP and managers' view of the&#13;
                                                           ILP.&#13;
                                                       4.  Enable records to show or hide based on filters&#13;
                                                           akin to an Excel auto-filter function (e.g.,&#13;
                                                           planned events, events within specific dates)&#13;
&#13;
Expand the ILP comment length: The comment             Do not limit the length of the "comment" field.&#13;
sections of the ILP are limited to 256 characters.&#13;
&#13;
Make the tutorials more complete: The LMS tutorial     Explain the reports in the tutorial.&#13;
for managers stops short of explaining what&#13;
information the reports provide (or do not provide,&#13;
e.g., lack of information on learning content).&#13;
&#13;
Clarify the report's navigation: When a manager's      Make the navigation of the report clearly indicate&#13;
report appears on screen, users may think that only    the content of the report from the start.&#13;
the "main report" or "aggregate results by numbers"&#13;
is available because the drop down menu only&#13;
shows "main report." The arrows on top of the&#13;
screen indicate "1/1+" instead of the actual number&#13;
of pages. It is misleading. Only after clicking the&#13;
yellow arrows showing the subsequent pages will&#13;
the subsequent section "section 1" with individual&#13;
records appear in the drop down menu, and the&#13;
number of pages in the report be indicated.&#13;
&#13;
Fix the export function: The report format "MS         Export numeric data as numeric data.&#13;
Excel 97-2000" exports numeric data as text.&#13;
Statistics cannot be directly computed on the          Make the report format "MS Excel 97-2000 (Data&#13;
number of staff, number of completed learning          only)" export data in a spreadsheet format ready for&#13;

                                                       on the section "report by aggregate numbers"&#13;
The report format "MS Excel 97-2000 (Data only)"       associated with each individual's record.&#13;
does not provide the data in a spreadsheet format&#13;
ready for analysis. It only exports the section        Put the data in the column corresponding to their&#13;
"report by staff name." Empty rows separate            variable names.&#13;
records. Variables related to the query (unit&#13;
queried, grouping variables) are not associated with&#13;
each record. Variable names are not in the same&#13;
columns as their data.&#13;
&#13;
Describe the report's selected content: The reports    Describe on the report the exact parameters used&#13;
do not indicate the exact choices made at the query    to produce the report, i.e., the unit and start and&#13;
time. Someone receiving the report cannot tell the     end dates of the period queried, the grouping&#13;
parameters of the report (i.e., start and end dates of variables, and the sort order.&#13;
the data, grouping variables, sorting order).&#13;
                                                       Automatically assign an export filename that&#13;
Every report is exported with the same file name       indicates the parameters queried.&#13;

Fixing malfunctions&#13;
&#13;
Make the report internally consistent: The number      Have both sections of the same report match.&#13;
of staff in the "report by aggregate numbers" does&#13;
not match the number of staff in the next section of&#13;
the same report called "report by staff name."&#13;

&#13;
Fix the sorting function: The report's sort order    Make the report return what was requested.&#13;
"number of days spent on learning (from high to&#13;
low)" sorts the data by "number of completed         Treat "number of completed learning activities" as a&#13;
learning events (from high to low)" instead, and     numeric value and sort them accordingly.&#13;
vice versa.&#13;
&#13;
Also, the sorting is inaccurate because the report&#13;
treats numbers as text. Therefore, "10" appears&#13;
between "2" and "1."&#13;
&#13;
Label and report years in the Bank clearly: The      Rename the ranges of years in the Bank to indicate&#13;
labels used to reports the years in the Bank are not where the categories are cut--without gaps or&#13;
continuous. Some people do not fit into any of the   overlaps.&#13;
report's year ranges. People with less than a year&#13;
in the Bank are reported as having "01-02" years.    Display the years of experience as of the end date&#13;
It is unclear whether people with two and a half     of the query and mention in the footnotes that the&#13;
years are counted with "01-02" or with "03-05"       data are as of the end date of the query.&#13;

                                                     Explain in a footnote what counts as years of&#13;
The years of experience may match the actual         experience, notably clarify how the following cases&#13;

                                                     4.   fixed term contracts, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Use the query's end date for grade groups: The       Display the grade group as of the end date of the&#13;
data on grade group is not always as of the dates    query and mention in the footnotes that the data are&#13;
queried. This is misleading when retrospective       as of the end date of the query.&#13;
queries are conducted.&#13;
&#13;
Fix query processing errors: The reports for         Make the queries return data instead of error&#13;
managers are slow and often return error             messages.&#13;
messages. Even when the "report by aggregate&#13;
numbers" displays data, the subsequent "report by&#13;
staff name" may display error messages. The&#13;
reports time out quickly. The error messages&#13;
associated with the internet navigation suggest&#13;
refreshing the query, but this operation is not&#13;
feasible and leads to other error messages.&#13;

            The alignment of staff knowledge and
            learning with the World Bank's strategic priorities :
            an assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report examines the alignment of
            staff learning with World Bank business priorities, by the
            beginning of fiscal year 2006 (FY06), a combination of three
            conditions: the sophistication of middle-income country
            counterparts, decentralization of the World Bank to over 100
            country offices, and increased reliance on newly hired,
            local (frequently junior) staff and consultants-had created
            a situation whereby the highest performance risks in all
            regions related to staff capabilities. Regional managers
            expressed concern about shortcomings in staff: (a)
            professional and technical expertise, including sensitivity
            to the political economy of the country and ongoing global
            issues; (b) practical operational knowledge, including
            project implementation skills; and (c) communications skills
            and country knowledge needed for being effective on the
            ground. Compounding this and despite the recognized efforts
            of many regional and strategic learning center learning
            coordinators, internal formal staff learning remained a low
            priority with front line managers. Moreover, the Bank's
            budget process was not designed to deliver resources for
            learning where they were most needed, with all regions
            receiving the same notional share of budget for learning in
            their annual budget envelope and most of this budget
            distributed to and managed by front-line units. Over
            three-quarters of regional learning resources were, de
            facto, not subject to Knowledge and Learning Board (KLB)
            review or included in Knowledge and Learning (K&amp;L) Plans.
