The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;

to reinforce financial stability, increase access to finance by households and firms, and enhance&#13;
the development of long-term financial markets.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a credit and&#13;
a grant, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the credit and grant are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of&#13;
such credit and grant are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth&#13;
in Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the&#13;
economic development of the Recipient and is of high developmental priority in the light of the&#13;
needs of the Republic of Mozambique.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
