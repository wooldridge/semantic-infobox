POVERTY AND GROWTH IN KENYA&#13;
Chapters 1 and 2 of this paper provide an empirical investigation of&#13;
trends in poverty and income distribution in Kenya between 1963 and 1974,&#13;
differentiated by region and occupation. Chapter 3 provides a framework for&#13;
explaining these trends in terms of the pattern of growth, and in particular&#13;
emphasizes the two way rural-urban interactions which largely explain the&#13;
"spread" effects of growth in Kenya. Chapter 4 derives some policy conclusions&#13;
on how future growth could be made to yield even higher degrees of poverty&#13;
redressal.&#13;

INTRODUCTION*&#13;
This paper has two major objectives. The first is to delineate&#13;
the trends in poverty and income distribution between 1963 and 1974 in&#13;
Kenya. The second is to provide a framework for explaining these trends,&#13;
and interalia the determinants of poverty in terms of the patterns of past&#13;
growth in the country. In this context it attempts to answer the question:&#13;
whether the type of growth Kenya has experienced has had any significant&#13;
"spread" effects in terms of alleviating poverty? Past studies (e.g..&#13;
ILO [56], Leys [66] ) have asserted that Kenyan style development has not&#13;
(and could not) lead to poverty redressal with rapid growth. The major&#13;
purpose of this paper is to question both the empirical as well as theo-&#13;
retical basis of this view. The paper provides a set of interrelated&#13;
hypotheses concerning poverty and growth which particularly emphasize two&#13;
way rural-urban interactions in contrast with unicausal models which stress&#13;
what has been labelled the "urban bias" of Kenyan style development (see&#13;
Lipton (66a]).&#13;
It should be emphasized at the outset that, given the limitations&#13;
of the data, namely the absence of a number of comparable surveys at dif-&#13;
ferent dates for determining the values of the major variables in the hypo-&#13;
thesised rural-urban interactions, the empirical evidence we cite cannot&#13;
establish the validity of these hypotheses with any marked degree of&#13;
rigour. In that sense, none of the evidence we cite is conclusive in&#13;
itself. We have, however, attempted to put together different pieces of&#13;
evidence into a mosaic in which each bit of the jigsaw puzzle is meant to&#13;
provide at least some degree of plausibility for the "story" we think best&#13;
explains the relationship of past patterns of Kenyan growth to poverty&#13;
redressal. Rigorous testing of our hypotheses must await better data. But&#13;
we hope to present enough tentative evidence to suggest at the least that&#13;
these seemingly unconventional hypotheses merit further attention and hence&#13;
the conventional views on Kenyan development are not as soundly based as is&#13;
normally assumed. The paper is in four parts. The first two parts provide&#13;
our empirical investigation of trends in Kenyan poverty and income-distri-&#13;
bution. The third part provides such evidence as is available on our hypo-&#13;
thesised rural-urban interactions for explaining these trends; whilst the&#13;
fourth part derives some policy conclusions on how future growth could be&#13;
even more poverty redressing.&#13;
*    Comments by members of two seminars at the World Bank have greatly&#13;
helped to improve the paper. In particular, detailed comments by&#13;
Jack Duloy and Eric Thorbecke were most valuable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Overall Trends in Poverty, Income Distribution, and Growth&#13;
In this chapter we present a summary account of the trends in&#13;
poverty, income distribution, and growth in Kenya between 1963 and about&#13;
1977.&#13;
Absolute Poverty&#13;
We begin with a snapshot of absolute poverty in 1974 (as the&#13;
available data are the most comprehensive or reliable for this year), and&#13;
then try to see how this distribution evolved, on the basis of more scat-&#13;
tered information for earlier and later years.&#13;
Any measure of absolute poverty is very sensitive to the&#13;
poverty line chosen. We discuss the relevant issues in this choice in&#13;
Appendix 1. We have taken the Thorbecke-Crawford [90] cut-off poverty&#13;
level of 2,000 sh. p.a. per rural smallholder household as the rural&#13;
poverty level. This has then been adjusted for rural-urban price dif-&#13;
ferentials and differences in mean household size to yield the poverty&#13;
lines shown in the last column of Table 1. (The notes to the Table&#13;
provide the details of their derivation.)&#13;

1/   According to IRS II, (38], in 1976 there were approximately 190,000&#13;
landless households in rural Kenya. Of these 120,000 are in the poten-&#13;
tially poor subset which excluaes government and urban workers and shop-&#13;
keepers (See Table 19 below) Our estimate for the range of mean income&#13;
for households dependent upon agricultural wage labor is 1,656 - 2,791&#13;
s.p.a. in 1974 (See footnote I p. 30). The mean household size of all&#13;
landless in IRS II was 3.76. Excluding those landless with good occupa-&#13;
tions we assume reduces this to 3.5. Perhaps then 50 percent of the&#13;
potentially poor subset of the landless have per capita incomes below the&#13;
poverty line of 2,000 s.p.a.&#13;
2/   We estimate the population of pastoral areas at 1,000,000.    Based on&#13;
guesswork we would divide this population into 75,000 pastoralists who&#13;
also farm 200,000 migrant farmers, and 725,000 pure pastoralists. The&#13;
pastoralists who also farm have a mean per capita income close to the&#13;
Kenya smallholder average so we will assume that the percentage of all&#13;
households below the poverty line is the same as the Kenyan smallholder&#13;
average (34 percent). Migrant farmers have mean incomes above the&#13;
poverty line but land is very concentrated (Campbell [8] Table 37).&#13;
In fact, the distribution of land among Campbell's sample of dry land&#13;
migrant farmers is very similar to land distribution in Nyanza, see&#13;
Table below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

30                   59.4                    59.1&#13;
The poverty line among migrant farmers occurs at 77 percent of mean income.&#13;
In Nyanza 55 percent of smallholders earn below 77 percent of mean income. We&#13;
will therefore assign 55 percent of migrant farmers to the poverty group. In&#13;
the case of pure pastoralists mean per capita income is below the poverty line.&#13;
Using the distribution of cattle cited above, only 15 percent of pastoralists&#13;
would have per capita incomes above the poverty line.&#13;
3/   See Appendix 3 [39a], p. 18.&#13;
4/   Wages in other urban areas are 79% of the Nairobi mean wage.     This&#13;
factor is then applied to the 1974 Nairobi income distribution and the&#13;
result rounded up to the nearest 10,000. The population of 'other&#13;
urban areas' is assumed to be 50% of total urban by 1974, see [39a]&#13;
Appendix 3, p. 1.&#13;

population in poverty.&#13;

7/   Mean household size of pastoralists/mean household size of&#13;
smallholders x smallholder poverty line = 15/7x2000=4,285.&#13;
8/   As in 7, 9.5/7 x 2,000 = 2,700.&#13;
9/   This is possibly too high given that the landless household is about&#13;
half the size of the smallholder household. However, prices might&#13;
be higher for the landless than those used to estimate smallholder&#13;
income.&#13;
10/ Smallholder poverty line of 340 s.p. capita X 1.69 cost of living&#13;
differential X urban household size.&#13;
11/ Derived from IRS-I [331.&#13;
From this Table it can be seen that in 1974 roughly four million&#13;
people were poor in Kenya (out of a total population of 14.3 million), of&#13;
which the majority (three million) were smallholders. There were only a&#13;
very small number of urban poor, namely sixty thousand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
It is not possible with the available data to present as complete&#13;
a picture of the extent of poverty (or its composition) for earlier years.&#13;
However, there is data which enables us to chart trends in the incidence of&#13;
poverty for three sub-groups of the Kenyan population, viz., smallholders in&#13;
Central Province, smallholders in Nyanza, and for Nairobi. This represents&#13;
74 percent of the smallholder population in 1974, and about 50 percent of the&#13;
urban population in the same year.&#13;
Table 2 provides our estimates of the proportion of the relevant&#13;
population in poverty for earlier years (1963 for Central Province small-&#13;
holders and 1969 for Nairobi), as well as the relevant proportions for 1974&#13;
(derived from Table 1).&#13;
Table 2:  Trends in Absolute Poverty, 1963-74&#13;

Smallholders (Central Province)       18.0        -            -        14.6&#13;
Smallholders (Nyanza)                   -         -          28.6       28.4&#13;

3%                     3%&#13;
Source: Derived in Appendices 1, 2, 3 in [39a].&#13;
From this table it can be seen that the proportion of the relevant population&#13;
in absolute poverty is likely to have remained relatively constant in Nyanza,&#13;
but somewhat declined in Central Province, whilst in Nairobi the incidence&#13;
of absolute poverty has been negligible.&#13;

Again, trends in thus distribution cannot be derived at the national level,&#13;
with the existing data, though as with absolute poverty, we can present the&#13;
changes in*the distribution of income within two small sub-groups, namely&#13;
for Central Province and Nyanza smallholders, for 1974 and the previously&#13;
cited earlier years. These trends are charted in Table 5.&#13;

Notes to Table 5&#13;
(a)       The following surveys provided the major part of the direct obser-&#13;
vations of smallholdings in Central Province:&#13;
[14]      1961  African Agricultural Census&#13;
[16]      1962  Population Census&#13;
[18]      1963  Economic Survey of Cental Province.&#13;
[19]      1964  Economic Survey of Nyeri District in Central Province&#13;
[251      1969  Population Census&#13;
[33,34,35]1974  Integrated Rural Survey I&#13;
[38]      1976  Integrated Rural Survey II&#13;
In constructing comparisons two major problems were encountered -&#13;
boundary changes and differing definitions of income. The boundary of Central&#13;
Province was altered substantially in 1963 so that [14], [16] and [18] cover&#13;
a different area from [25], [33] and [38]. However, by checking on the loca-&#13;
tion of primary sampling units in each survey and by re-aggregating the dis-&#13;
trict level data it proved possible to construct a virtually common boundary.&#13;
The district of Meru (which was in Central Province Prior to 1963 but not&#13;
subsequently) and Nyandarua (which was in Central Province post 1963 but not&#13;
previously) were both excluded. Since Nyandarua formed a distinct ecological&#13;
zone in [33] and [38] (the High Altitude Grasslands) the latter was feasible&#13;
without major recomputing.&#13;
The concept of income used in (18] was not very satisfactory and&#13;
the revisions made by Kmietowicz and Webley, [65], were adopted instead. The&#13;
definition in [33] was also suspect due to a large group of households re-&#13;
porting negative income but with high levels of consumption. It was found&#13;
that the major cause of this was the inclusion of transient changes in the&#13;
value of livestock. Two definitions of income were used instead. In one all&#13;
sales of livestock were excluded so as to be compatible with the redefinition&#13;
used in [18]. This would lead to an understatement of income inequality, and&#13;
since some cattle sales were included in [18] it also involves an understate-&#13;
ment of income inequality in 1974 relative to 1963. Nominal income in 1974&#13;
was deflated by 1.56 for the real income series.&#13;
(b)       In addition to those sources cited in (a) above data were taken from:&#13;
[37] Economic Survey of Nyanza Province, 1970&#13;
In constructing comparisons between [14] and (33] the data required adjustment&#13;
for boundary changes in 1963.    Fortunately most data in [14] was presented on&#13;
a district basis and the districts of Central and South Nyanza correspond to&#13;
the post-1963 definition of the province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
1.    [37], Table 1.8.   This includes households reporting&#13;
for less than 10 months because the exclusion of these&#13;
households biases upwards the income estimates in the&#13;
remaining tables of [37].&#13;
2.    [35]  Income redefined to adopt the permanent offtake&#13;
concept of livestock income. This being that rate of&#13;
offtake which would keep constant the value of the herd.&#13;
This replaced transient changes in the value of livestock.&#13;
The remaining 1.3% of households still showing negative&#13;
income were found to be farmers with government loans,&#13;
anxious to demonstrate an inability to repay them. These&#13;
households were found to have above average levels of&#13;
consumption and were excluded from the income distri-&#13;
bution data. No such households were reported in [37]&#13;
so the problems of negative income did not arise.&#13;
3.    This figure is unreliable for reasons given in (b) 1 and&#13;
2.&#13;
(c)       Derived from Household Budget Surveys [15], [30].&#13;
From Table 5 it can be seen that the distribution of income amongst&#13;
the rural sub-groups of the population has worsened; per capita real income&#13;
amongst the lower 40 percent of the smallholder population of Central Province&#13;
was roughly constant, whilst that of the other income classes increased sub-&#13;
stantially. For Nyanza the per capita real income of the lowest 40 percent&#13;
declined by about 19 percent between 1970 and 1974, that for the middle 30&#13;
percent of smallholders rose significantly, and that for the top 30 percent&#13;
increased very substantially (about 54 percent).&#13;
For Central Province and Nyanza smallholders we can also chart&#13;
changes in the distribution of consumption (for the relevant years). These&#13;
are shown in Table 6.&#13;

The distribution of consumption also seems to have worsened in both groups,&#13;
but not as much as the distribution of income.&#13;
Data is also available for charting changes in the distribution of&#13;
land holdings amongst smallholders in Central and Nyanza provinces between&#13;
1960 and 1974, as given in Table 7. This shows that concentration in land&#13;
holdings has increased over time in both regions, and the concentration of&#13;
land is greater than that for either income or consumption amongst small-&#13;
holders in the two regions.&#13;

It should be stressed that we have presented snapshots at two&#13;
points in time rather than fully documented trends. This is important in two&#13;
respects, first that the changes might not be part of a steady, continuing&#13;
process but might be the result of a once-and-for-all event, and second that&#13;
the changes might merely be the outcome of transient or random events. The&#13;
first possibility applies to all the previously cited distributional changes&#13;
but might be particularly true of land, the Africanisation of the White&#13;
Highlands being the one-off event. The second possibility applies mainly to&#13;
changes in income distribution: consumption should approximately reflect&#13;
permanent income and therefore be subject to smaller transient variations,&#13;
nor would we expect significant transient variations in the distribution of&#13;
land.&#13;
Growth&#13;
Between 1964 and 1975, real GDP grew by 70 percent. With population&#13;
growing at 3.3. percent p.a. real per capita income grew at about 2.2 percent&#13;
over the decade. Between 1974 and 1976, however, per capita GDP was almost&#13;
constant, but again rose by 3.2 percent p.a. between 1976 and 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Per capita consumption grew at the rate of 2.5 percent p.a. over&#13;
the period 1963-74. Total wage employment between 1966 and 1975 grew at&#13;
the rate of 3.8 percent per annum, of which agricultural wage employment&#13;
grew by only 0.44 percent per annum, and private non-agricultural employment&#13;
by 4.05 percent p.a., whilst public sector wage employment grew at 6.07&#13;
percent p.a. Urban wage employment grew at the rate of 3.3 percent p.a.&#13;
between 1967-76. However, this included substantial differences in growth&#13;
rates in sub-periods. There was virtual stagnation till 1970, rapid growth&#13;
between 1970 and 1974, stagnation in 1974-75, and a recovery between 1975-77.&#13;

II. The Characteristics of the Poor&#13;
In this chapter we provide evidence on the characteristics of the&#13;
poor in Kenya. From Table 1, it can be seen that (in descending order of&#13;
importance) the poor are to be found amongst smallholders, pastoralists,&#13;
landless, squatters, migrant farmers in dryland areas, and urban dwellers.&#13;
1. Smallholders&#13;
Thirty percent of the smallholder population in 1974 were poor.&#13;
From Table 8, it can be seen that the poor smallholders have less land, lower&#13;
inputs (purchased and own produced) per acre, lower non-farm incomes, lower&#13;
education levels, lower subsistence consumption as well as lower levels of on-&#13;
farm innovation (as measured by purchased inputs) than the smallholder average.&#13;

1/   IRS coverage of smallholdings is not complete since large farm areas in&#13;
which illegal subdivision has taken place are excluded, however it&#13;
clearly ranks among the best surveys of African smallholders. A problem&#13;
encountered by the survey was that some 7% of houeholds reported negative&#13;
income during the year. On inspection these households have high levels&#13;
of both consumption and assets. Negative income is not a sign of poverty&#13;
and can be attributed to two causes, households which have suffered&#13;
transient livestock losses, and households with large loans outstanding&#13;
which have overstated farm costs fearing that the survey was connected&#13;
with loan repayment. In this table and our subsequent analysis of the&#13;
poverty group we have excluded the negative income group and also those&#13;
households whose income is within the band 0-2,000 s.p.a. purely due to&#13;
large livestock losses. Our poverty group is therefore smallholders with&#13;
incomes between 0 and 2,000 s.p.a. after exclusion of these groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
From Table 9 which provides our estimates and those by Crawford&#13;
and Thorbecke [8a], it can be seen that smallholder poverty is not strongly&#13;
region-specific. In no region on our estimates are less than 20 percent or&#13;
more than 50 percent of smallholders poor. (But see the note to the Table)&#13;

Note:  The figures in brackets are the estimates of Crawford and Thorbecke&#13;
[8a], of the percentage of households in each region who suffer&#13;
from what they term food poverty. Their estimates differ from ours&#13;
because they have taken account of regional price differences too&#13;
in the minimum food basket, which we have ignored for the reasons&#13;
given in Appendix 1. The reason why they show a much higher pro-&#13;
portion of households in poverty in the Coast, is because they&#13;
estimate that their food cost index based on prices of maize and&#13;
beans were 26% higher than the national average in the Coast. Their&#13;
household food poverty lines have ranged from shs 1265 in Nyanza&#13;
to shs 2301 in Coast province. However, T. Kirton in an unpublished&#13;
note on [8a] has argued that they have exaggerated the cost of the&#13;
reference diet, by a mistaken weighting of beans and maize in their&#13;
standard reference diet. Secondly they have underestimated the&#13;
calorific content of maize. Taking account of these errors Kirton&#13;
finds only 10% of Kenya smallholders in food poverty.&#13;
Using a Thiel index only 4% of the variance in household incomes is explained&#13;
by inter-regional differences. This is not necessarily an indication that&#13;
rural poverty is not location specific. Whilst regions are the appropriate&#13;
units for investigating policy-induced inequalities (being the location-&#13;
specific budgeting divisions) they are not the best units for the analysis of&#13;
inequalities due to ecology. However, even when we grouped the IRS-I data&#13;
into eight ecological zones, only 10% of the variance in incomes is explained&#13;
by interzonal differences. The major explanations for smallholder poverty,&#13;
is unlikely, therefore, to be found in regional or ecological differences.&#13;
Nevertheless, not surprisingly, there are differences in the reasons for&#13;
smallholder poverty in the different regions. To focus on these we examine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the causes of smallholder poverty in greater detail for three regions: viz.&#13;
Central, Nyanza, and Western provinces, which together accounted for 60&#13;
percent of smallholder poverty in 1974.&#13;
These three provinces represent different stages of rural develop-&#13;
ment. Thus, Central Province has had a high degreee of agricultural innova-&#13;
tion (in the form of a switch to cash crops, improved livestock, hybrid maize&#13;
and a high level of purchased inputs): By contrast, Western Province has had&#13;
little agricultural innovation, whilst Nyanza is at an intermediate stage.&#13;
There are two questions we can ask in delineating the character-&#13;
istics of smallholder poverty in these three regions. Firstly, what dis-&#13;
tinguishes the poor smallholders from the rest in each region? Secondly,&#13;
what explains the relatively higher incidence of poverty amongst smallholders&#13;
in Western Province as compared with Nyanza, and, in both as compared to&#13;
Central Province? The relevant, data from the First Integrated Rural Survey&#13;
(IRS-I) 1/ presented in Table 10 enables us to provide some answers to these&#13;
questions through the derivations we have made in Tables 11 and 12.&#13;

sample was used to select the households. The sample frame does not in-&#13;
clude non-agricultural households, urban households or households with&#13;
holdings over 20 hectares. However, as the total small-holder population&#13;
in 1974 was estimated to be 10.3 million, out of a 'national population of&#13;
13.4 million, the IRS covered over 80% of the national population. The&#13;
sample size is considered to be adequate for drawing conclusions at the&#13;

Table 10 shows characteristics of small-holders in 3 provinces and&#13;
by four income groups. We compare (in Tables 11 and 12) the determinants&#13;
of household incomes of two "poor" groups (those with incomes in the range&#13;
0-999 spa and 1,000-1,999 spa) with those of two relatively better-off&#13;
groups (income ranges 4,000-5,999 and 6,000-7,999 spa). We then seek&#13;
explanations of the determinants of small-holder poverty by comparing the&#13;
increases in the inputs of land, an innovation index (derived in Appendix 2)&#13;
and purchased farm inputs, which are jointly required to yield an extra 1,000&#13;
shillings of farm income to the average poor small-holder in the region.&#13;
Assuming that the relative prices of these inputs and hence the ratios of&#13;
their marginal products are the same for every income group in the respective&#13;
region, variations in farm output and farm incomes will depend upon the joint&#13;
variation in these inputs accross the various income groups. Thus for each&#13;
region we compare the levels of these inputs for the 0-999 s.p.a. income&#13;
group with those for the 4,000-5,999 spa group; and those for the 1,000-1,999&#13;
spa group with those for the 6,000-7,999 group. It being assumed that the&#13;
resulting income increase would in each case unambigously redress the poverty&#13;
of the relevant "poor" group. In each of these two-way comparisons we&#13;
determine the marginal increases in the three inputs which are required to&#13;
yield an extra 1,000 shillings of farm income to each of the two poor small-&#13;
holder groups.   The figures for the region's average 'poor' small-holder is&#13;
then derived as the weighted average of the determinants of the two poor&#13;
groups incremental income, the weights being the number of households in the&#13;
two respective "poor" income classes. The resulting figures are given in&#13;
Table 11. 1/&#13;
1/   Thus if Y is farm income, L is land, I is innovation and P is purchased&#13;
farm inputs, then we assume that Y=f (L, I, P) - (1)&#13;
Total differentiation yields dY= fL dL + fI dI + f     dP - (2)&#13;
Hence we have for an increase in farm income of 1000 shs that:&#13;
1000 = 1000 [ f   dL  +  f   dl  +   f  dP   -(3)&#13;
L dY       I  dY      p dY&#13;
Assuming that in each region small holders in the different income groups&#13;
face the same prices of the inputs, the marginal products of the inputs&#13;
will ex hypothesi be the same for the different income groups in each region.&#13;
It should be noted that we have no data to test this "efficiency" assumption.&#13;
If it is valid, however, then given that the fi terms are region - specific&#13;
parameters, we can determine the total differentials dL/dY, dI and dP/dY.&#13;
dy&#13;
From IRS-1 we have the data in Table 10 for four sub-groups, two "poor" and&#13;
two "rich", on the mean values of Y, L, I,P for each of the groups. De-&#13;
noting poor by subscript p, and rich by subscript r, we then have&#13;
dX = Xr - Xp&#13;
dY     Yr - Yp&#13;
for X = L, I, P. The resulting figures for the two sub-groups are then&#13;
averaged by using the no. of households in each of the two poor sub-groups&#13;
as weights. Multiplying the resulting figures by 1,000 yields the figures&#13;
given in Table 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

This shows that, in Central province for instance, the average&#13;
poor smallholder has 2.27 hectares of land, uses purchased farm inputs of&#13;
132 sh. p.a., and has an innovation index (based on a composite of the adop-&#13;
tion of coffee, tea, and improved livestock per farm) of 757. To generate an&#13;
extra 1,000 sh. of farm income (and assuming unchanged productivities of these&#13;
inputs), this average poor smallholder would need an extra 0.089 hectares of&#13;
land, plus an extra 86 sh. worth of purchased farm inputs, and an increase in&#13;
its innovation index of 539.&#13;
By contrast in Nyanza, incremental farm income requires (in absolute&#13;
terms) much more extra land, and much less innovation or increases in purchased&#13;
farm inputs than in Central and Western provinces (except for the innovation&#13;
requirement being lower in Western province). The latter is clearly an inter-&#13;
mediate case between Central and Nyanza Provinces. Thus we can conclude that&#13;
smallholder poverty in Central Province is primarily associated with a failure&#13;
to innovate relative to the better off farmers in the region, whilst that in&#13;
Nyanza is also associated with their low levels of land holdings. In Westrn&#13;
Province all three factors are of importance, but relative to the mean levels&#13;
of the inputs on the average poor smallholder farm, the levels of innovation&#13;
and purchased farm inputs need to be doubled to generate an extra 1,000 sh.&#13;
of farm income, whilst the land area has to be increased by only 20 percent.&#13;
These conclusions are also supported by the relative strengths of the simple&#13;
correlation between land size and smallholder income for the three regions&#13;
which we ran on IRS-1 data. The correlation coefficient is significant at&#13;
the one percent level for Nyanza, at only the 5 percent level for Western&#13;
Province, and is not significant even at the 10 percent level for Central&#13;
Province. 1/&#13;
From Table 12, we can also provide some explanations for the higher&#13;
incidence of poverty amongst smallholders in Western and Nyanza provinces.&#13;

1/   It should be noted that, we do not have data which stratifies farm&#13;

to the data on farm size and farm income stratified by household income.&#13;
The relevant data for some (of the six income) groups is given in&#13;

Prima facie one would expect that differences in the average incomes of all&#13;
smallholders in the three regions would be correlated with the differences&#13;
in the incidence of poverty amongst their smallholders. From Table 12, it&#13;
can be seen that the mean household income in Nyanza is about 20 percent&#13;
less than in Central Province, whilst that in Western Province is nearly&#13;
half that in Central Province. But whereas, in Western Province both the&#13;
farm and non-farm components of household incomes are lower than their re-&#13;
spective values for Central Province, in Nyanza mean farm income levels of&#13;
the average smallholder are higher than in Central Province, and the dif-&#13;
ference in the mean household incomes in the two provinces is explicable&#13;
entirely in terms of differences in non-farm income. Thus, we would expect&#13;
that differences in the relative incidence of poverty in the three provinces&#13;
would be related to the determinants of lower non-farm incomes in Nyanza&#13;
relative to Central Province, and to both lower farm and non-farm incomes in&#13;
Western Province. For the latter, from the evidence on the mean inputs of&#13;
innovation, purchased farm inputs and labor on the average smallholder farm,&#13;
it appears that all these are lower than those on a smaller average farm size&#13;
in the other two provinces.&#13;
The characteristics of smallholder poverty identified above, are&#13;
in terms of the determinants of farm income, and the relative contribution&#13;
of farm income to total household income.    Of the determinants of farm in-&#13;
come the differences in the size of land-ownership are in a sense structural&#13;
variables, for which we provide no further explanation and take them as given&#13;
in what follows. For the two other inputs, innovation and the purchase of&#13;
farm inputs, we need to explain differences in their values across dif-&#13;
ferent smallholder farms. Two variables which are likely to be important&#13;
determinants of these inputs are education and financing.&#13;
In addition to loans, non-farm income is likely to be an impor-&#13;
tant source of funds to break any financial constraint on financing both&#13;
innovation as well as purchased farm inputs. Thus, for instance, if the&#13;
average poor smallholder were to increase his purchased farm inputs to&#13;
the level of the mean for all smallholders, the financial burden would&#13;
require a reduction in household consumption of about 25 percent if met out&#13;
of current income. Hence the importance of the financial constraint on&#13;
purchases of farm inputs as well as the capital expenditure (including the&#13;
'waiting' involved in the relatively long gestation periods) associated&#13;
with innovation. Thus, we need to look at differences in education, loans&#13;
and non-farm income as providing further (and deeper) explanations of the&#13;
poverty of smallholders in the three regions. Table 13 provides the&#13;
necessary data, on loans and non-farm income.&#13;

From Table 13 it can be seen that the levels of loans cum non-farm&#13;
income are correlated with the levels of innovation and purchased farm in-&#13;
puts for smallholders in both the Central and Western Provinces. The Table&#13;
also suggests that, as we have already found that innovation and/or purchase&#13;
of farm inputs were important determinants of poverty amongst smallholders in&#13;
Central and Western Provinces, the availability of loans and increases in non-&#13;
farm income would be relatively more important determinants of small-holder&#13;
poverty within these regions, than in Nyanza (where the inequalities of land-&#13;
holdings were an additional determinant of smallholder poverty).&#13;
As regards the effects of differences in the levels of non-farm&#13;
incomes cum loans, as between the three regions, in explaining the differing&#13;
regional incidence of small-holder poverty, from Table 13 it appears that the&#13;
differences in the levels of innovation and purchased farm inputs are corre-&#13;
lated with those in non-farm income cum loans. Thus it. seems that besides&#13;
the importance of differences in land-holdings for Nyanza province, the major&#13;
correlate of smallholder poverty is the availability of financing. It should&#13;
be noted that for Nyanza, the low non-farm income component is a direct cause&#13;
of smallholder poverty (see Table 12). What the above arguments have sought&#13;
to establish is that non-farm income cum loans are also indirectly (through&#13;
their high correlation with the levels of innovation and purchased inputs)&#13;
important correlates of smallholder poverty in Central and Western Provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Furthermore, we would expect that the loans component of the avail-&#13;
ability of finance for smallholders would be closely correlated with non-farm&#13;
income (as it is), with the level of non-farm income determining both the&#13;
ability as well as the willingness of smallholders to borrow. The risk of&#13;
borrowing without an adequate non-farm income is that land offered as col-&#13;
lateral might have to be sold. That this is not an idle fear for smallholders&#13;
in Kenya, is borne out by the experience of smallholders on the Lugari settle-&#13;
ment scheme. On this scheme, smallholders were forced to take out loans to&#13;
finance both purchases of current inputs as well as the purchases of the free-&#13;
hold of the land. By 1977, 80 percent of the smallholders had forfeited their&#13;
land because of loan defaults. Similarly, lenders in Kenya look to the non-&#13;
farm income of smallholders as a source of servicing any loans, when extending&#13;
credit. For example, in a recent survey of smallholders with loans for farm-&#13;
ing purposes taken out from the Kenya Commercial Bank, David and Wyeth [41]&#13;
found that 70% received income from wage employment. The survey covered&#13;
Nyanza, Western, Rift, Eastern and Central Provinces. Applying the same&#13;
coverage and weights to IRS-I data 1/ yields the result that only 9.7% of&#13;
smallholder household heads received income from wage employment, only 20.5%&#13;
undertaking any activity other than operating their own holding. Hence,&#13;
smallholders taking out loans for farming purposes are heavily biased towards&#13;
those with above average non-farm incomes. Further support for this is given&#13;
in Table 14 which shows that most farmers taking out loans regarded their&#13;
salary as more important than their farm incomes. 2/&#13;
1/   Table 6.4 of [33], using teaching, government and urban employment&#13;
as a proxy for wage employment.&#13;
2/   If we had this data classified by farm size, which we do not, a&#13;
firm test of the hypothesis would have been possible.&#13;

Thus non-farm income is likely to be the most important element in the abil-&#13;
ity of smallholders to break the financial constraint, which inhibits both&#13;
innovation as well as purchases of farm inputs (to the requisite level).&#13;
This raises the obvious question: what determines variations in&#13;
non-farm incomes amongst smallholders both within and between regions? Table&#13;
15 shows that for smallholders both in Central and Western Provinces, varia-&#13;
tions in urban non-farm income (from regular wage employment and remittances)&#13;
is a much larger (and hence quantitatively more important) component of&#13;
variations in non-farm income, than those in income from rural, non-farm&#13;
activities.&#13;

As regards the variations in non-farm income between regions, from Table 16,&#13;
two points emerge. First, the share of rural-based non-farm income in total&#13;
household income is roughly the same in all three regions, and it would be&#13;
plausible, therefore, to assume that this component of non-farm income was&#13;
a function of farm income. 1/ Secondly, the variations in non-farm incomes&#13;
between the regions seem to depend entirely upon variations in the urban-&#13;
based component of non-farm income.&#13;
This leads us to enquire into the reasons for variations in urban-&#13;
based non-farm incomes of smallholders within, as well as between, regions.&#13;
Table 17 shows that in all three regions, among the correlates of an increase&#13;
in smallholder poor farm incomes by 1000 s.p.a., there is a significant cor-&#13;
relation between increments of urban-based non-farm income and education for&#13;
the varying smallholder households.&#13;

1/   Once again lacking any data which stratifies farm income by farm size,&#13;
this argument cannot be clinched.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
From this same table it appears that the same correlation holds between the&#13;
means of the regional smallholder urban-based non-farm income and the pro-&#13;
portion of the smallholder population with education.&#13;
Thus, through the above chain of argument, we seem to have arrived&#13;
at the importance of varying levels of education as the major indirect in-&#13;
fluence which explains variations in smallholder household incomes. The&#13;
chain runs through the effects of education on urban-based non-farm income,&#13;
and thence on total non-farm income which in turn enables any financial&#13;
bottlenecks in the purchase of farm inputs, as well as other means for&#13;
innovating, to be broken, leading to higher farm incomes. However, it may&#13;
also be thought that education would also directly effect the levels of&#13;
farm incomes through its effects on inducing innovation. From Tables 10&#13;
and 18 it appears that though there is a positive correlation between edu-&#13;
cation and innovation levels within each region, there is no correlation&#13;
in the same variables between regions.&#13;

Nyanza                               89                         16&#13;

Thus Western Province has the most educated smallholder population but the&#13;
lowest level of innovation amongst our three regions. So it might not be&#13;
implausible to conclude that the within region correlation between education&#13;
and innovation is due to the indirect effect of education on innovation&#13;
through the chain which runs via the effects of education on the levels of&#13;
urban-based non-farm income, rather than any direct effects of education on&#13;
innovation levels.&#13;

2. The Landless, Outmigrants and Pastoralists&#13;
About 11 percent of all rural households are landless, but not all&#13;
of the landless are poor. As Table 19 shows, if the categories of "urban&#13;
employment", "shopkeepers", and "government workers" are taken to be occupa-&#13;
tions where income levels are likely to be well above the poverty line, we are&#13;
left with roughtly 7.3 percent of the rural population which is landless and&#13;
likely to be poor.&#13;

information on any of the other occupations besides agricultural&#13;
laborers, who, however, account for 60 percent of the population&#13;
in this subset (excluding the category other employment - see&#13;

Comparing various indices of their economic status with that of smallholders,&#13;
from Table 21, it appears that the average lanndless labor household is much&#13;
poorer than the average smallholder household.   In (39a] Appendix 5, we pro-&#13;
vide some reasons for our guess estimate that roughly half of the landless&#13;
labor households fall below our poverty line.&#13;

As the demand for hired rural labor, as well as the price such labor&#13;
commands are likely to be the most important determinants of the income levels&#13;
of the rural landless labor households, we briefly outline the trends in these&#13;
variables. In [39a] (Appendix 1) we have estimated that, at least in Central&#13;
Province, the demand for hired labor has increased threefold between 1963-74.&#13;
This was accompanied by a rise in real wages of about 50 percent during the&#13;
same period. It therefore seems likely that at least in Central Province,&#13;
landless labor households would not have got poorer over the period. Since&#13;
1974, this area has seen a further very substantial increase in real agri-&#13;
cultural wages (which approximately doubled between 1974-78) as a result of&#13;
the coffee boom. This illustrates the importance of rising labor demand in&#13;
yielding fairly rapid rises in real wages.&#13;

However, from the above evidence we cannot deduce much about the&#13;
changing incidence of poverty amongst the landless in the other regions.&#13;
As Table 22 shows, landlessness in Central Province itself had decreased&#13;
between 1964-76.&#13;

possible to exclude Nyandarua, so this district was excluded using the&#13;
1974 land distribution taken from [33]. [33] does not include data on&#13;
the landless but the weight of Nyandarua in IRS II was only 3.8% so&#13;
its effect upon the landlessness figure could only be minimal.&#13;

This is primarily the result of outmigration from the province (see Table&#13;
23). Given our evidence on the increased land concentration in the province&#13;
(Table 7), the decrease in landlessness could not be due to any redistribution&#13;
of land amongst the province's rural population.    Thus any provincial trends&#13;
in landlessness are likely to be misleading, because most of the potential&#13;
landless in each of the provinces have outmigrated to newer lands, where they&#13;
cease to be landless. It is therefore more useful to incorporate the out-&#13;
migrants as part of the subset of potentially landless groups.&#13;
Most of the potentially landless have migrated to three broad areas&#13;
of "newer" lands. These are (a) to the settlement schemes, which were ex-&#13;
hausted during the 1960s; (b) to large farms as squatters; and (c) to dry&#13;
lands, previously occupied by.pastoralists. (In addition there is a rela-&#13;
tively small number of landless migrants to urban areas, but as we show in&#13;
Chapter 3, rural-urban migration is not linked to landlessness).&#13;
In deriving the characteristics of the outmigrants, and hence of&#13;
the potentially landless (which includes the actual landless in each province),&#13;
we need some explanation of the causes of landlessness in Kenya, as well as&#13;
their income earning potential in their new locations.&#13;
There are four main causes of landlessness in Kenya. From a survey&#13;
of Machokos, and a study by Migot-Adholla for Nyanza [71), [72], [79], it&#13;
appears that first, privatistation of land, leading to legal disputes and&#13;
the ensuing court decisions, have led to landlessness. Second, land sales to&#13;
finance school fees or repay loans, are also important causes of landlessness.&#13;
Third, squatters who leave the holdings which they farm (due for instance to&#13;
a drought) cannot return as they have no rights to the land. Fourth, land-&#13;
lessness results from widowhood and divorce as old social norms are broken.&#13;
Not only are wives deprived of their husband's lands following a divorce, but&#13;
their children too are often disinherited.&#13;
The resulting landlessness is the major cause' of rural-rural&#13;
migration. 1/    Of the possible alternative locations for these migrants, the&#13;
1/   In a survey of migrants to Machakios 53 percent had previously been land-&#13;
less and a further 27 percent had owned less than one acre. Rural migra-&#13;
tion is neither education nor age biased. Rural-to-rural out-migration&#13;
has been a feature of Central Province, Western Province and parts of&#13;
Nyanza.   For example, in 1962-69 the district of Kagmega experienced&#13;
net out-migration of 310,927. Mbithi [68] considers western Kenya to be&#13;
suffering from "rural involution" in which the frustrated landless resort&#13;
to delinquency such as crop burning in addition to out-migration. Rural&#13;
landless out-migrants do not go to the towns but either purchase land&#13;
elsewhere, become squatters, or move to marginal lands. Narok, for&#13;
example, has experienced very substantial in-migration, especially from&#13;
Central Province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

settlement schemes ceased offering any outlet after the late 1960s. We have&#13;
very little information on those who have chosen to squat on large farms.&#13;
That leaves those migrants who have settled on the dry lands of the pastoral-&#13;
ists. This move does lead to some increase in the migrants' household in-&#13;
comes. We have estimated that the average income in 1976 of landless agri-&#13;
cultural labor households was within the range of 1,700 to 2,500 sh. p.a. 1/&#13;
From a survey by Campbell, [8], the mean income of dryland migrant farmers in&#13;
1976 was 2,590 sh. p.a. This would still leave a number of these dryland&#13;
migrants below the poverty line. In Table 1 we estimate that roughly half of&#13;
dryland migrant households were below the poverty line in 1976.&#13;
The movement of the potentially landless into the drylands, has&#13;
brought them into conflict with the pastoralists, another of our poverty&#13;
groups in Kenya. The migrants compete with the pastoralists for land.&#13;
From a survey by Campbell, (8], it appears that most pastoralist&#13;
households are poor, with a mean household income of 3,270 sh. p.a., but with&#13;
a mean household size of 15. As the distribution of income amongst the&#13;
pastoralists, as judged by the distribution of their main income generating&#13;
asset (viz. cattle), is fairly equal (see Table 24), we can deduce that most&#13;
pastoralist households (about 85 percent of the relevant population) are&#13;
likely to fall below our poverty line (see Table 1).&#13;

1/   In 1974 the mean smallholder household paid out 67 s.p.a. to regular&#13;
wage laborers. If these payments coincided with the income from agri-&#13;
cultural labor of households with heads engaged in this activity then&#13;
the mean income from this source of such households would have been&#13;
2,791 s.p.a. As an absolute minimum, if smallholder regular laborer&#13;
hiring were the sole source of income in the activity then mean house-&#13;
hold income of laboring households from this source would have been&#13;
1,656 s.p.a., though of course this is a substantial understatement.&#13;
Average earnings per laborer on plantations was 1,885 s.p.a. in 1974,&#13;

3. The Urban Poor&#13;
The most important aspect of urban poverty in Kenya is that despite&#13;
the fears of many observers it is limited in extent, and its incidence has not&#13;
increased over the years. Table 25 summarises our estimates of the Nairobi&#13;
income distribution for 1974. We have estimated that given our poverty line&#13;
less than three percent of the urban population is poor. 1/&#13;

1/   Scott, [88] has estimated that the urban cost of living is 69% above the&#13;
rural cost of living for low income households. Almost certainly this&#13;
estimate is rather high. Mean per capita smallholder income in 1974 was&#13;
591 s.p.a., equivalent to 1,000 s.p.a. at urban prices. Yet only 4% of&#13;
the Nairobi population were on per capita incomes below 1,000 s.p.a.&#13;
The margin which cuts off the poorest 3% of the Nairobi population (the&#13;
lowest group which can be measured meaningfully), converted into rural&#13;
prices consigns 58% of the smallholder population to the 'poverty'&#13;
category.&#13;
In order to assess the trends in urban poverty we can make use of&#13;
the loose association between occupational status and poverty. It is likely&#13;
that most of the urban poor will be found amongst those in the urban informal&#13;
sector and amongst the unemployed. From Table 26 it will be seen that the&#13;
poor have a higher unemployment rate and higher participation rate in low&#13;
income self-employment (less than 4,200 sh. p.a.) than the average urban&#13;
household.    But this does not mean (as some previous observers have con-&#13;
cluded) that all (or even most) unemployed workers and those in the urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
informal sector are poor. Thus in [39a] Appendix 3, we derive estimates&#13;
of the "poor" on the basis of a poverty line (which is roughly twice the&#13;
national poverty line) amongst the unemployed, and those in the urban in-&#13;
formal sector in 1974. We find that even with this much higher poverty&#13;
line, 67 percent of the unemployed are above the poverty line, as compared&#13;
with 78 percent of all urban households. This suggests that there is only&#13;
a very loose correlation between unemployment and urban poverty.&#13;

Furthermore, the average urban "poor" household has 1.44 members in&#13;
the labor force as compared with 1.76 for all urban households and 2.2 for&#13;
non-poor urban households. This implies that if we exclude the household&#13;
head, the number of dependents in the labor force is much lower for "poor"&#13;
urban households. If urban poverty and unemployment were closely related,&#13;
we would thus expect to find a preponderance of heads of households amongst&#13;
the unemployed (or conversely a relatively smaller proportion of dependents&#13;
amongst the unemployed). From table 27, it is clear that this is not the&#13;
case for urban Kenya. Most of the unemployed are young dependents, and as&#13;
the poor households have only 12 percent of all the urban dependent labor&#13;
force, whilst dependents account for 33 percent of urban employment, it is a&#13;
reasonable inference that most of these dependent unemployed are not poor.&#13;

As regards the informal sector, Table 28 shows that, contrary to&#13;
the received view of this being a homogenous low income sector, the distribu-&#13;
tion of income in this sector in 1977 was bi-modal, with the population in&#13;
the sector roughly equally divided between richer entrepreneurs and poorer&#13;
workers. The House survey also shows that, entrepreneurs' average income&#13;
was roughly 27,600 sh. p.a., well above any conceivable urban poverty line!&#13;
The wage-earners average income was 1,850 sh. p.a., which would put them&#13;
well below our national poverty line.&#13;
Table 29 shows changes in the number of workers in the informal&#13;
urban sector and those unemployed between 1969 and 1977. This shows that&#13;
the proportion of the male labor force in the two activities has declined&#13;
somewhat. We know from the House survey [54] that roughly half of those&#13;
in the urban informal sector in 1977 were poor wage-earners. As we have&#13;
no similar breakdown of the distribution of income within this sector for&#13;
earlier years, it is not possible to say whether the 1977 figures represent&#13;
any kind of trend. However, from Table 5 we know that the ovrall urban&#13;
income distribution has worsened. The lower income group's share of urban&#13;
income was higher in earlier years, which suggests that it is unlikely that&#13;
urban poverty was ever a serious problem in Kenya.&#13;

III. Poverty and Growth: Rural-Urban Interactions&#13;
We have presented a statistical snapshot of the poor in the last&#13;
chapter. In this chapter we provide an account of the ways in which the&#13;
pattern and rate of growth have effected the levels and composition of poverty&#13;
in Kenya. From the last two chapters, it is clear that, there are three sets&#13;
of 'events' in Kenya in the past decade which need explanation. The first,&#13;
is the nature and determinants of smallholder innovation, which has been very&#13;
rapid by African standards, but whose uneven spread in large part accounts for&#13;
the existing smallholder poverty (the largest curent poverty group in Kenya).&#13;
Secondly, the pattern of growth has led to an increased concentration in land&#13;
holdings. The sources of this concentration, as well as its effects on the&#13;
incidence of poverty will have to be examined. Thirdly, we need to explain a&#13;
non-event, namely that despite the fears of many observers in the early 1970s&#13;
there has been no dramatic increase in urban poverty, and its expected corre-&#13;
lates, the levels and rate of urban unemployment, and the size of the urban&#13;
informal sector.&#13;
Our major thesis (which will hopefully emerge) in this chapter is&#13;
that all these three 'events' can be explained in terms of some specific&#13;
rural-urban interactions. In the process we also hope to show the relation-&#13;
ship between urban growth and rural poverty - redressal. We have shown in&#13;
Chapter II, that the major explanation of differential rates of innovation&#13;
amongst smallholders lies in their differential access to urban-based non-&#13;
farm income. In turn differences in the latter are dependent upon differen-&#13;
tials in education. We begin by trying to provide some causal explanations&#13;
for these links.&#13;
1. Migration, Education and Innovation&#13;
In the previous chapter we have argued that differences in the&#13;
extent and pace of innovation amongst smallholders financed by urban-based&#13;
off-farm income have been the major determinant of the incidence of small-&#13;
holder poverty. Moreover, we have found that despite the concentration of&#13;
land, at least in Central Province, from Tables 10 and 11, innovation and&#13;
hence smallholder poverty are not closely related to land size class. 1/&#13;
For, as is shown by this Table and Table 5, at least the middle income&#13;
group of smallholders have matched the real per capita income growth of the&#13;
richest 30 percent in Central Province. That this diffusion of innovation&#13;
is relatively land size neutral, is also borne out by some evidence from a&#13;
survey of households making sales of milk and tea in two locations in the&#13;
Central Province in 1965 and 1970, [39].&#13;
1/   Once again this is an indirect inference from the data on farm size and&#13;
farm income stratified by household income (in Table 10), as we do not&#13;
have data stratified by farm size.&#13;

Table 30 shows the changes in the percentage of households within&#13;
different classes of the value of milk and tea sales, between 1965 and 1970.&#13;
Thus for instance for the first sub-location, of the new entrants since 1965,&#13;
55 percent were in the 0-500 sh. sales class in 1970.     Similarly of the&#13;
householders who had sales of between 0-500 sh. in 1965, only 33 percent&#13;
remained in the same sales class in 1970, 51 percent having moved into the&#13;
higher sales class of 500-2,000 and 15 percent into that over 2,000 sh.&#13;
Table 30, therefore, shows that of the households in all the sales classes in&#13;
1965, a substantial portion had succeeded in markedly raising their sales&#13;
into higher sales classes. However, only 18 percent of farm households in&#13;
Central Province in 1974 were growing tea. Moveover, from Table 31 mean land&#13;
holding size in the two regions of the surveyed households was not very large.&#13;
Hence it would seem likely that the increased sales from milk and tea for&#13;
each sales group (in 1965) would not be confined to the large farms. As the&#13;
overall growth in income from milk and tea sales in both sub-locations was&#13;
about 19 percent, it would thus appear that there has been substantial dif-&#13;
fusion of the benefits from the expansion in those income generating activi-&#13;
ties, but that these effects have probably been confined to the relatively&#13;
larger amongst the middle income land size groups. Hence, it would seem that&#13;
it is the relatively greater diffusion of new income opportunities amongst&#13;
the middle income rural households in Central Province, which would explain&#13;
their maintenance of real per capita income growth rates on a par with those&#13;
in higher income groups.&#13;
This conclusion is strengthened by the evidence from the same survey&#13;
summarised in Table 31. This provides estimates of the Gini coefficient of&#13;
cash income from sales of tea and milk of the survey households. It shows&#13;
that the distribution of income from sales of tea and milk had become more&#13;
equal in both sublocations between 1965 and 1970. This means that the house-&#13;
holds which had started with the smaller sales in 1965 had experienced the&#13;
more rapid growth in sales.&#13;

Where non-farm incomes are high enough, smallholders ootsde._ .entral&#13;
Province too, will adopt improved farming.   In Western Province--those tarmetr&#13;
whose total incomes exceeds 8,000 spa are comparable with the mean householder&#13;
in Central Province in terms of farm improvements - and radically better than&#13;
the mean smallholder in Western Province (see Table 32).&#13;

We have argued that it is the urban-based off-farm income component&#13;
of smallholder household income which is likely to be the most important deter-&#13;
minant of innovation. In turn it is the educational status of smallholder&#13;
household members willing and able to migrate to the towns which is likely to&#13;
be the most important determinant of the size of their urban-based off-farm&#13;
income. Thus Momanyi, [77], compared two rival sub-clans in South Nyanza.&#13;
One had invested in education, the other had not. (The reason for this was&#13;
that schools take up land and the more powerful sub-clan had used its power&#13;
to locate the schools on the land of the rival sub-clan). The sub-clan which&#13;
acquired education was then able to get jobs in the local town (Kisii) and&#13;
this money was used to purchase improved livestock and to switch into cash&#13;
crops - especially coffee. All political power still lies with the unedu-&#13;
cated sub-clan but their economic fortunes have diverged dramatically from&#13;
those of the educated sub-clan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
We thus need to examine the links between education, migration and&#13;
smallholder innovation. Table 33 provides data on the educational charac-&#13;
teristics of rural-urban migrants for the period 1964-77. This shows that&#13;
migrants have always been better educated, and are becoming more so over&#13;
the years. They are better educated relative to both the rural smallholder&#13;
population as well as rural-rural migrants. The latter's educational charac-&#13;
teristics are the same as those of the rural population. 1/ However, rural-&#13;
urban migrants have lower levels of education than the urban population, and&#13;
are concentrated amongst those with primary education.&#13;

In Table 34 we provide our estimates (derived in [39a] Appendix 4)&#13;
on the changing urban demand and supply balances of labor differentiated by&#13;
educational status between 1969-77. This shows that most of the unskilled&#13;
labor in the urban sector is provided by migrants with primary education.&#13;
Moreover, as the bulk of unskilled jobs (from this Table) are in the urban&#13;
formal sector (with only seven percent of the incremental unskilled urban&#13;
employment between 1969-77 being in the urban informal sector), it would&#13;
appear that the bulk of rural-urban migrants seek and find wage employment&#13;
in the urban organised sector.&#13;

The average wage in manufacturing in 1974 was 7,500 sh. p.a., which&#13;
would put most of the migrants who found organised sector jobs well above the&#13;
urban (and of course the rural) poverty line. It would also enable them to&#13;
finance substantial remittances to their rural relatives. That in fact this&#13;
is the case is borne out by Table 35.&#13;

In a survey of low and middle income earners in Nairobi, Johnson and Whitelaw,&#13;
[60] found that in 1971 roughly 21 percent of the urban wage bill was remitted&#13;
to the rural areas. They also found that these remittances were income-in&#13;
elastic, which implies that the poorer wage-earning urban households were&#13;
remitting a higher proportion of their urban earnings. This establishes one&#13;
important link between, rural-urban migration, and the reverse flow of remit-&#13;
tances which form the most important part of non-farm rural incomes, via.,&#13;
the urban-based component, which we have seen is an important determinant of&#13;
differential levels of innovation amongst rural smallholder households. 1/&#13;
The above evidence on remittances would also suggest that the urban&#13;
wage-earners (who are predominantly rural-urban migrants) are keen to main-&#13;
tain their rural links. Why? From Table 36, it is apparent that labor&#13;
turnover, particularly amongst the urban unskilled workers, is fairly high.&#13;
At the same time, from Table 37, it is apparent that there is a high rate of&#13;
reverse out-migration from the cities to the countryside. Thirdly, from&#13;
Table 38 it appears that, although there is a substantial in-migration of&#13;
women to the towns for marital purposes, once married, these women and&#13;
their children return to the rural areas. Hence the low and falling ratio&#13;
of women to men in Nairobi since 1973. 2/&#13;
1/   Rempel and Lobdell [85a], however, have recently argued that "the role&#13;
remittances have played and are likely to play in the realization of&#13;
rural development" is limited.   They reach this conclusion, in particular&#13;
for Kenya, on the basis of survey evidence that, the remittances were&#13;
according to the Johnson and Whitelaw (60] survey respondents used for&#13;
the following particular rural uses: "school fees - 12 per cent; payment&#13;
of debts - 2 percent; maintenance of farms, 4 per cent; and support of&#13;
family and friends - 96%" ([85a] p. 334). From this they conclude that&#13;
remittances have financed "increased rural consumption, education and&#13;
better housing" (p. 336) rather than rural development. But their&#13;
argument is untenable as it fails to recognize the fungibility of the&#13;
available resources of the smallholders. Even though (as is well known&#13;
from the debates on the effects of foreign capital inflows), recipients&#13;
of remittances claim that most of the remittances were spent on consump-&#13;
tion, that does not mean that by increasing overall household incomes,&#13;
an increase in total productive investment did not also take place.&#13;
To deny this, would imply that investment (future consumption) was an&#13;
inferior good.&#13;

Taking these three pieces of evidence together it seems plausible that the&#13;
typical rural-urban migrant maintains his rural links, because he intends&#13;
to return fairly soon to the countryside. It should also be noted that the&#13;
figures for net migration provided in Table 37 understate the gross migration,&#13;
and hence the relative importance of this rural-urban interaction.&#13;
Summarising the argument so far, it appears that educated rural-&#13;
urban migrants with formal sector jobs are the major source of urban-based&#13;
off-farm income, which in turn is the major determinant of the levels of&#13;
smallholder innovation. Thus the faster urban formal sector employment grows,&#13;
the greater are the urban based non-farm income streams, and hence the faster&#13;
the spread of innovation amongst smallholders. As we have noted in Chapter I,&#13;
formal sector wage employment increased very rapidly since 1970, and hence we&#13;
can infer, resulted in the very rapid increase in smallholder innovation.&#13;
Furthermore, this argument would suggest that it is unequal access to at least&#13;
primary education, as well as to formal sector employment amongst those with&#13;
primary education, which would be major determinants of differential levels&#13;
of innovation amongst smallholders within a region, as well as those between&#13;
regions.&#13;
However, three qualifications about the link between educational&#13;
status and rural innovation which we have sought to establish need to be made.&#13;
The current distribution of innovation, reflects the distribution of educa-&#13;
tional opportunities sometime in the past, because the off-farm income fuel-&#13;
ling innovation is obtained by people with educational characteristics which&#13;
they acquired in the past. Moreover, it seems that in the past education was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
not highly correlated with household income. This in part was due to the&#13;
predominance of missionary schools which were as much concerned with the&#13;
salvation of their pupil's souls as with their ability to pay for education.&#13;
As educational levels and access to formal sector urban jobs, and hence&#13;
the ability to remit funds to the countryside, are highly correlated, we&#13;
would expect that in the years before education had become correlated with&#13;
the income levels of rural households, remittances and rural household in-&#13;
come would not be closely related. The former would be a function of&#13;
education, the latter in early years was primarily determined by farm size.&#13;
Table 39 bears this out. We find that remittances and rural household in-&#13;
come, which were not correlated in 1963, showed a marked correlation by&#13;
1974.&#13;

This suggests that given the relatively random nature of the composition of&#13;
the stock of educated people in earlier years, and the importance of educa-&#13;
tion (through the urban link which provided the off-farm income flows which&#13;
financed rural innovation), as a determinant of the distribution of house-&#13;
hold rural incomes, by the 1970s, we would expect a great deal of social&#13;
mobility to have occurred within the rural areas in the past. As differences&#13;
in land holdings amongst smallholders were probably not the major source of&#13;
household income differences in the early 1970's (as they had been in the&#13;
past), -but were determined by the distribution of a 'new' asset, viz., educa-&#13;
tion, which at least intra-regionally seems to have been randomly distributed&#13;
across the rural population, considerable social mobility amongst the small-&#13;
holder population would have ensued. However more recently, with the rela-&#13;
tive increase in fee-paying schools, education and rural household income&#13;
are now very closely related, and these benign mechanisms for social mobility&#13;
have ceased to operate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Secondly, access to urban formal sector wage employment is likely&#13;
be unequal because of the relative distance of the various rural areas&#13;
:om the fastest growing urban centre, namely Nairobi. Thus between 1969-77,&#13;
there were 70,000 extra jobs created in Nairobi, but less than 2,000 in&#13;
Kisumu (the local urban centre for Nyanza and Western Province). Thus,&#13;
whereas the educated smallholders in Central Province had a fairly close&#13;
fast growing urban centre to fuel their off-farm income increases, similar&#13;
opportunities were limited for the equivalent smallholder population of&#13;
Nyanza and Western Province. They would have to migrate a much further dis-&#13;
tance to participate in the fast growing Nairobi economy. Because of the&#13;
relatively greater distance, one would also expect that, the migrants in&#13;
Nairobi from Nyanza and Western Province would find it more difficult to&#13;
visit their smallholdings as often as migrants from Central Province, and&#13;
perhaps they would not be able to use their urban-based off-farm income as&#13;
effectively for rural innovation.&#13;
The third qualification concerns our neglect so far of the deter-&#13;
minants of poverty in Coast province and to question whether, in line with&#13;
our hypothesised rural-urban interactions, the Mombassa labor market played&#13;
the same role for Coast small-holders as Nairobi did for Central province in&#13;
fuelling on-farm innovation. First, from Table 9, it will be seen that,&#13;
though on our estimates the incidence of poverty amongst Coast small holders&#13;
is higher than in Central Province (but lower than in most other provinces&#13;
apart from Rift), as a proportion of the total number of poor small holders&#13;
Coast province accounts for only 4% of the Kenyan total. Thus in the&#13;
national context, poverty in Coast province is of marginal significance.&#13;
Secondly, from Table 40 it will be seen that given the ecology of this&#13;
province, the indices of innovation we have derived for the other provinces&#13;
(based on improved livestock, coffee and trees) are irrelevant for Coast&#13;
province. There is virtually no improved livestock and no coffee or tea&#13;
grown in the province. Coconuts and cashew are the cash crops, but we do&#13;
not have any way of deriving an innovation index from these which would be&#13;
comparable with that for the other provinces. Thirdly, for ecological&#13;
reasons it is likely that the agricultural potential of this province is&#13;
poor. This is borne out by the evidence in Tables 41-and-42. From the&#13;
former Table, it will be seen that, remittance income forms the largest&#13;
proportion of household income for Coast small-holders. By contrast farm&#13;
income is a low (25%) percentage, and of the same order of magnitude as&#13;
remittances, of total household income. This is not surprising given the&#13;
relatively poor agricultural potential of this area (see World Bank [96]&#13;
p's 453 - 470). By contrast as Table 42 shows, the Coast small holders&#13;
have a very high level of income from trading and home crafts as compared&#13;
with the other provinces. We would therefore conjecture that, the very&#13;
substantial remittances in the Caost province (besides providing increases&#13;
in consumption for small-holder families) have been probably channeled into&#13;
the above non-farm activities. Finally, it is again likely that the basis&#13;
of these large remittances, was the rapid growth of urban jobs in Mombassa,&#13;
which increased by 23,497 between 1969-77. This represented a 41% increase&#13;
in urban jobs in Mombassa compared to a 43% increase in Nairobi, during&#13;
this period.&#13;

Hence though for ecological reasons the role of remittances in&#13;
financing rural development is likely to remain unimportant they have never-&#13;
theless been an important source of increased household income for Coast&#13;
small holders and probably have in part been productively invested in trade&#13;
and handicrafts. Thus, even though the precise role of remittances in the&#13;
two way rural-urban interactions we have emphasised for other provinces,&#13;
maybe different in Coast province, nevertheless they are likely to have been&#13;
an equally important source of the benign indirect effects of urban growth&#13;
on the levels of small-holder welfare.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
We hope therefore to have provided some evidence to suggest that&#13;
there are important indirect links between the growth of the urban sector,&#13;
and the rate and levels of rural innovation and more generally of rural devel-&#13;
opment. Moreover, these links provide a deeper explanation of the changing&#13;
extent and incidence of smallholder poverty through the mechanisms identified&#13;
above.&#13;
In addition, however, the same rural-urban interactions also have&#13;
implications for the incidence of poverty amongst the landless laborers, and&#13;
the rural-rural outmigrants, and thence on the pastoralists (the other major&#13;
poverty groups in Kenya). As shown in Chapter II, the major determinant of&#13;
poverty amongst the landless laborers (and hence their propensity to migrate&#13;
to the dry lands, and/or to become squatters), is the availability of remu-&#13;
nerative work in the major agricultural regions. Both the level of demand&#13;
for rural hired labor, and its relationship with the given supply, will&#13;
determine the rural wage rate, which in turn will determine the income levels&#13;
of rural landless labor households.&#13;
The demand for rural hired labor (from both the landless and small-&#13;
holder households, who each supply roughly half of the hired labor in Kenyan&#13;
agriculture (see Table 43)) is effected both by trends in innovation as well&#13;
as in land concentration. Keeping land concentration and land area constant,&#13;
we have estimated that in Central Province, between 1963-74, total small-&#13;
holder labor demand increased by 2.4 percent p.a., with the demand for hired&#13;
labor rising by 2.3 percent p.a., as a result of innovation, which was measured&#13;
by the changes in cropping patterns, type of livestock and the balance between&#13;
livestock and crops (see [39a] Appendix 1 for details). This increased demand&#13;
for hired labor in the Province was associated with an increase of about 50&#13;
percent in real rural wages during this period. This would certainly have&#13;
raised the incomes of landless laborers in the region. Thus, we can conclude&#13;
that the smallholder farm innovation financed by urban remittances, would have&#13;
reduced the incidence of poverty not only amongst smallholders, but also&#13;
amongst the landless. This, of course, assumes that this innovation did not&#13;
lead to any further concentration of land, which could be expected to have&#13;
countervailing depressive effects on the demand for labor. We turn to this&#13;
issue in the next section. At this stage we can conclude that through the&#13;
rural-urban mechanisms described in this section, rapid growth in the demand&#13;
for urban unskilled labour could (in the absence of land concentration) simul-&#13;
taneously raise the income levels of rural smallholders, as well as those of&#13;
rural landless laborers.&#13;

2.   Land Concentration, Education and Urban-Rural Migration&#13;
The relatively rosy picture of the effects of growth on poverty in&#13;
Kenya painted in the last section needs to be modified in the light of the&#13;
trends in the increased concentration of land we found in Chapter I. For&#13;
land concentration, will ceteris paribus reduce the overall demand for rural&#13;
labor. Thus in Central Province between 1963-74, controlling for innovation&#13;
and overall land area, we find that there was a reduction in the demand for&#13;
labor of 1.6 percent p.a. due to land concentration. Land concentration in-&#13;
creases the demand for hired labor (we estimate by about 2.9 percent p.a. in&#13;
Central Province between 1963 and 1974). However, because the overall demand&#13;
for labor falls, the supply of hired labor (ceteris paribus) increases by more&#13;
than the increase in demand for hired labor, and this is likely to have&#13;
a depressive effect on real rural wage rates, which in turn will damage&#13;
the income prospects of both poor smallholders and landless laborers.&#13;
If, moreover, it could be shown that the increase in land concen-&#13;
tration were due to increased purchases of land by innovating smallholders,&#13;
then some at least of the beneficial effects of such innovation on small-&#13;
holder and landless labor poverty would be offset by the above deleterious&#13;
effects. In fact from the above figures 1/ for Central Province, it appears&#13;
that the rise in the demand for labor as a result of rural innovation was&#13;
almost completely offset by the reduction in demand for labor flowing from&#13;
the increased land concentration in this period. Furthermore, in these&#13;
circumstances, smallholder innovation would lead both to relatively stagnant&#13;
rural real wages despite rising agricultural output, and also to the increas-&#13;
ing proletarianisation of the rural labor force (as a larger proportion of&#13;
the rural populace were turned into landless laborers).&#13;
1/   See (39a] Appendix 1 for the derivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Furthermore, this increase in landlessness would then spill over&#13;
into outmigration to the drylands, where without any marked improvement in&#13;
their income levels (as we have seen in Chapter II that dryland migrant&#13;
farmers are also a major poverty group), these outmigrants would be competing&#13;
for scarce land with another major poverty group in Kenya - the pastoralists.&#13;
As these outmigrants to the drylands usually transfer inappropriate agricul-&#13;
tural techniques used in the high-potential areas that they come from (such&#13;
as deep ploughing), to their new environment, there is the further potential&#13;
for damaging their own income prospects as well as those of the pastoralists.&#13;
This is because the use of these inappropriate techniques leads to soil ero-&#13;
sion, and hence to a diminution of the available land area. Furthermore,&#13;
such soil erosion also damages the prospects of irrigating these drylands,&#13;
since it increases the pace at which dams silt up. Thus land concentration&#13;
can be seen to lead to direct and indirect effects on the incidence of poverty&#13;
in Kenya. Hence it is of some importance to examine the causes of land con-&#13;
centration by determining which groups are net purchasers and net sellers of&#13;
land in Kenya.&#13;
As land is one of the most important rural assets, as well as the&#13;
traditional source of social status in Kenya, it is not surprising that most&#13;
land sales in Kenya would in some sense be distress sales. In Chapter II,&#13;
we provided evidence which shows that this was indeed the case. Most land&#13;
sales were due to the need to finance school fees and/or debts.&#13;
Though it is natural to expect that most of the land purchases are&#13;
by innovating smallholders, the available evidence does not support this hypo-&#13;
thesis. First, in the provinces where innovation has not occurred there is&#13;
some evidence of a correlation between farm incomes and farm size (land area)&#13;
(see Chapter II). Secondly, in Central Province, which has had the most in-&#13;
novation, our expectation would be that if these innovating farmers had in-&#13;
creased the size of their land holdings, the correlation between farm income&#13;
and farm size would be at least as strong as in Nyanza and Western Province.&#13;
However, as reported in Chapter II, there seems to be little correlation&#13;
between farm incomes and farm size for Central Province. This would suggest&#13;
that, the larger farms are being farmed relatively inefficiently compared with&#13;
the small smallholder farms in Central Province as well as the large farms&#13;
in Nyanza. Moreover, as virtually all the land in Central Province is of&#13;
high quality, this absence of a correlation between farm income and farm size&#13;
cannot be explained in terms of differences in land quality. Thirdly, from&#13;
the evidence in Chapter II, it appears that smallholder innovators in Central&#13;
Province do not have more land than non-innovators. Thus it would seem&#13;
unlikely that innovating smallholders (who could be expected to apply their&#13;
superior agricultural skills on all parts of their land holdings) are the&#13;
major net purchasers of land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Who then are the net purchasers of land in Kenya? Our hypothesis&#13;
is that they are high income urban households, buying land both with a view&#13;
to its speculative return, as well as for somewhere to retire. Wie have six&#13;
pieces of (admittedly speculative) evidence in support of this view. First,&#13;
a survey by Cohen, [40], within Central Province in 1971, showed that 90 per-&#13;
cent of farms over three hectares had absentee landowners.&#13;
Secondly, from Table 44, it appears that a fair number of&#13;
Nairobi residents retire outside Nairobi.&#13;

From Table 45, it appears that the migration of people over the age of about&#13;
40 from the cities to the countryside is heavily biased towards those with&#13;
at least secondary education. Moreover, we know that urban income levels&#13;
are highly correlated with education levels (see Thias and Carnoy [88)).&#13;
Amongst the urban male labor force aged over 40, only 13 percent have&#13;
attained educational levels of secondary school and above, whereas amongst&#13;
the urban-rural migrants aged 40, 38 percent are educated to the secondary&#13;
school level and above. This sugeests that the stream of older urban-rural&#13;
migrants contains a heavily biased proportion of the most successful urban&#13;
residents.&#13;

Thirdly, from Table 36, it appears that the older urban-rural&#13;
migrants are people who have been relatively long-term residents. Thus, we&#13;
find that the turnover rate in occupations with more highly educated workers&#13;
are lower than those for uneducated (unskilled) workers. This suggests that&#13;
the average worker in these "educated" urban occupations is more likely to&#13;
spend a larger part of his working life in that occupation and hence in the&#13;
urban sector.&#13;
Fourth, from Table 35, we know that the high income urban groups&#13;
have a low propensity to remit funds to the countryside. This suggests that&#13;
they are probably not as directly involved with the rural sector as the rela-&#13;
tively poorer unskilled urban workers.&#13;
Fifth, from Migot-Adholla's study of the Lugari settlement scheme&#13;
[71], it appears that the settlement officers actively promoted purchases of&#13;
land from the larger number of defaulting smallholders, by absentee urban&#13;
dwellers, who had sufficient off-farm income to meet debt repayments.&#13;
Sixth, the survey by David and Wyeth, [41], supports the link&#13;
between higher income wage earners and land purchases. Of those taking out&#13;
bank loans for farm purposes, 53% had secondary education and 70% had wage&#13;
income. For this 70% the mean wage was 1,489 s.p.m. - well above the average&#13;
formal sector wage in 1975, the year of the survey. Only 50% of borrowers&#13;
were resident in rural areas and 22% of all farm loans had been used to pur-&#13;
chase land, the mean loan being 22,700 s. Borrowers were asked to estimate&#13;
the contribution of the loan to operating profits. Out of six different uses&#13;
of loans, land purchase had the lowest rate of profitability.&#13;
But, if land purchase is a poor way of raising operating profits&#13;
it can still prove a very good investment. We estimate that the price of&#13;
land has risen threefold in Certral Province between 1974-78, and from all&#13;
accounts this rise was part of a much older trend. Given these substantial&#13;
rises in the price of land, it would be rational for urban residents contem-&#13;
plating retirement in the countryside to purchase land well ahead of their&#13;
actual retirement. 1/&#13;
Thus, we would argue that smallholder innovation cannot be held&#13;
to be primarily responsible for the increased concentration of land in&#13;
Kenya, and hence for the effects of such concentration on the incidence&#13;
of poverty.&#13;
1/   But admittedly, it would equally be rational for recently enriched&#13;
smallholders too, to purchase land, and no doubt some have. Our hypo-&#13;
thesis, however, is that the motives for land purchase by smallholders&#13;
are the rises in farm incomes this permits, which from our evidence is&#13;
not very large, but those of urban dwellers is a place to retire.&#13;

3. Urban Employment Growth, Education, and the Urban Poor&#13;
The ILO report in 1972 concluded: "that the problem of the working&#13;
poor (in urban areas) constitutes the major part of the employment problem.&#13;
From the information available, we conclude that the employment problem in&#13;
urban Kenya is serious and growing." 1/ From our evidence in Chapter II, it&#13;
is clear that this inference is not warranted either for, the period that the&#13;
ILO was surveying or for the subsequent period. First, there is no serious&#13;
problem (and certainly not a growing one) for the urban working poor in Kenya.&#13;
Secondly, urban unemployment rates have fallen over time, and the share of the&#13;
urban unemployed and the urban informal sector (which were thought to harbor&#13;
massive numbers of the urban working poor), in the urban labor force has been&#13;
falling. Thirdly, from Table 46, it can be seen that, despite rapid growth in&#13;
formal sector wage employment, there has been no explosion of urbanisation,&#13;
fuelled by massive net inflows of rural-urban migrants.&#13;
Table 46: Annual Growth Rates of the Nairobi Population&#13;

Source: Same as Table 44.&#13;
It might be thought that this is the result (as in part it is) of&#13;
rapid increases in urban wage-employment in the organised sector. However,&#13;
based on the expectations generated by the Harris-Todaro type model (which&#13;
was initially formulated for Kenya), many observers would have predicted&#13;
that this rapid expansion in formal sector employment would have led to&#13;
increasing rural-urban migration, urban unemployment and the rapid growth&#13;
of low wage employment in the urban informal sector. Why have these gloomy&#13;
prognostications been belied by the historical record?&#13;
1/   [56] page 63.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
It will be best to set out the implicit assumptions underlying the&#13;
view that rapid urban formal sector employment growth would lead to rising&#13;
rural-urban migration and urban unemployment and poverty. The basic assump-&#13;
tion was that the urban formal sector wage was relatively rigid, and as not&#13;
much faith could be put on rising rural incomes to narrow existing rural-urban&#13;
income differentials, growth in formal sector urban wage employment would in-&#13;
crease rural urban migration and the equilibrium level of unemployment, as&#13;
migrants equated their expected incomes from high wage urban employment with&#13;
their rural incomes. In fact, between 1971 and 1977, the rural-urban income&#13;
differential declined substantially. Thus, real formal sector urban wages&#13;
fell by 22 percent during this period, whilst at least in Central Province,&#13;
the per capita incomes of a substantial proportion (the top 60 percent) had&#13;
been growing at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent between 1963 and 1974. If&#13;
this trend also applied to the period 1971-77, then per capita smallholder&#13;
incomes would have risen by 18 percent in this period. Hence, the rural-&#13;
urban income differential is likely to have declined by about 34 percent&#13;
between 1971 and 1977, as compared with its relative value in 1971.&#13;
Moreover, the Harris-Todaro type framework is known to be rather&#13;
simplistic in its assumptions about the homogeneity of the job-searchers, as&#13;
well as about the processes by which they adjust their expectations about&#13;
finding various types of high wage urban jobs. The so-called "bumping" model&#13;
of job search and urban labor market adjustment (see Fields [44]) provides a&#13;
more subtle account of the workings of the urban labor market. Within this&#13;
framework, education is used as a screening device by potential employers,&#13;
and hence it is important to examine the changing balances in the demand and&#13;
supply for different types of educated workers. Thus, if we can order jobs&#13;
by the educational level that employers are currently using as a screen, the&#13;
model postulates that if someone with a higher level of education offers&#13;
himself for a job which the employer has been filling with workers with a&#13;
lower-level of education, the more highly educated worker will be preferred.&#13;
Hence job-searchers with levels of education that are higher than those&#13;
current amongst workers at each rung in the job-ladder, will have a very&#13;
high probability of being hired. With an expansion of education relative&#13;
to the jobs at each rung in the job-ladder, the "excess" workers with the&#13;
requisite education for that rung, will then find that it is increasingly&#13;
in their interest to offer themselves for jobs at the next lower rung in&#13;
the job ladder, because whereas their prospects of finding a job at the rung&#13;
which was (till then) associated with their educational qualifications are&#13;
declining, their prospects of finding jobs at the next lower rung still&#13;
remain high. As this realization sinks in, more and more of the "excess"&#13;
workers at each rung of the job ladder and the accompanying educational&#13;
status, will offer themselves for jobs at lower and lower rungs of the job&#13;
ladder. In the process, whilst employers will be seen to be upgrading the&#13;
jobs at each rung in terms of the required educational qualifications, rela-&#13;
tively more educated workers will be seen to be 'bumping' the less educated&#13;
cohorts off each rung of the ladder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
The resulting composition of the unemployed as well as the rate&#13;
of unemployment over time will then be determined by three sets of inter-&#13;
related factors. First, the relative imbalance between the jobs offered&#13;
and job seekers at each educationally differentiated rung in the job ladder,&#13;
will determine how many people are in "excess" at that rung in the present&#13;
period. Next, of this 'excess', some will decide to remain unemployed, and&#13;
try their luck at the same rung in the ladder in the next period, and some&#13;
will lower their sights and seek and obtain (with near certainty) jobs at&#13;
the next lower rung in the ladder. This latter choice will be determined&#13;
in part by the speed with which job-seekers lower their expectations, when&#13;
excess supply for a particular level of educated labor appears, as well as&#13;
their access to some means of financing the unemployment they might like&#13;
to choose whilst they are deciding whether or not to lower their sights.&#13;
Thirdly, as the major source of financing is likely to be financial support&#13;
from relatives, and as (given the private costs), the more educated are likely&#13;
to belong to richer families, the relatively less educated are also likely to&#13;
be the least able to finance any prolonged period of unemployment, whilst&#13;
they are adjusting their job expectations. For these reasons we should expect&#13;
that, ceteris paribus, unemployment rates should be heavily biased towards&#13;
the more educated, and that over time, with an expansion of education at each&#13;
level relative to the jobs, the bumping process will be forcing more and more&#13;
of the relatively less educated to choose between unemployment and continued&#13;
job search. This should lead to a tendency for the unemployment rate to be&#13;
lowered over time. Both these predictions are borne out for Kenya by the&#13;
evidence we have cited in Chapter II.&#13;
It remains for us to provide more direct evidence that in fact the&#13;
'bumping' process which we have postulated accounts for these trends is in&#13;
fact taking place in urban Kenya. Table 33 provided evidence on the changing&#13;
educational profile of rural-urban migrants (the major component of urban job-&#13;
seekers), which showed that their educational levels have been rising over&#13;
time. Secondly, Table 47 shows the falling propensity of secondary school&#13;
leavers to migrate to the towns, between 1964 and 1976. Moreover, we have&#13;
computed that the propensity to migrate of primary school leavers was .049&#13;
between 1964-68 and .033 between 1969-76. Thus the propensity to migrate&#13;
of secondary school leavers has fallen faster than that of primary school&#13;
leavers.&#13;

Finally, the table also shows the aggregate implications for the urban labor&#13;
market of these three processes, viz, a reduction in rural-urban income&#13;
differentials, 'bumping', and the changing expectations of job-seekers. The&#13;
net migration stream of form IV leavers remained fairly constant over the&#13;
years, representing an increasing share of total migration but a reduced&#13;
share of total form IV output.&#13;
4. A Framework for Analysing Growth and Poverty-Redressal in Kenya&#13;
We are now in a position to provide a framework which shows the&#13;
interrelationships between growth (in particular in the urban sector) and&#13;
poverty redressal (mainly in the rural areas), which is based on the evidence&#13;
and analyses presented above, and within which various policy options can be&#13;
discussed. In order to bring out the novel features of this framework, it&#13;
will be best to contrast it with the implicit model of the interrelationships&#13;
between urban growth and rural poverty redressal which seem to underlie the&#13;
thinking of many observers of the Kenyan scene in the past.&#13;
Caricaturing somewhat, the conventional views on the likely conse-&#13;
quences of Kenyan style development can be put as follows: Given existing&#13;
inequalities in the distribution of assets (including human capital), and&#13;
various structural rigidities which weaken intersectoral links, the promo-&#13;
tion of rapid expansion of the private formal sector as well as of capitalist&#13;
smallholder farming, would lead to both increasing concentration in income&#13;
and wealth in both rural and urban areas, but more seriously to the immiseri-&#13;
sation of a growing non-formal urban labor force, as well as increasing&#13;
proletarisation of the weakest groups in the rural countryside. In this&#13;
process, it is believed, the benefits of growth would not spread evenly or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
fast enough amongst most sections of the population, because the adjustment&#13;
mechanisms in the form of price adjustments to particular sectoral imbalances&#13;
in demand and supply, would either be weak or absent. Hence, the structural&#13;
features, for instance wage-differentials, would not be modified over the&#13;
course of development, and instead maladjustments in demands and supplies&#13;
would show themselves up increasingly in the form of quantity adjustments.&#13;
This led to predictions of increasing rural-urban migration flows into low&#13;
income infor'mal sector employment or burgeoning unemployed pools of urban&#13;
labor. Furthermore, in these implicit models, most of the flows of people&#13;
and resources are assumed to be one way, from the rural to the urban sector.&#13;
Many have therefore accepted the thesis that this type of development entails&#13;
a built-in urban bias, which needs to be corrected by deliberate acts of&#13;
public policy. The latter would be aimed at both changing the structure&#13;
(for instance) of the existing income and asset distribution, as well as in&#13;
reducing the one-way rural-urban flows. To the extent that various struc-&#13;
tural features of the economy have to be accepted as given, these observers&#13;
see the promotion of the urban informal sector as the main panacea for urban&#13;
poverty redressal. As regards the rural sector they see that: "for most of&#13;
the rural.population, the problem is not the availability of jobs, in the&#13;
sense of paid work for others, but the availability of land." 1/&#13;
Our thesis is that on the basis of the available evidence assembled&#13;
and discussed above, many of the implicit assumptions underlying these views&#13;
have proved to be false, and at the same time they are based on rather sim-&#13;
plistic notions of the interactions between the rural and urban sectors in&#13;
the process of development. Thus one of the primary assumptions of the alter-&#13;
native view that markets (and in particular labor markets) do not function&#13;
efficiently, with prices adjusting fairly smoothly to emerging imbalances in&#13;
demand and supply is false. This is borne out by the very substantial real&#13;
wage adjustments that have taken place, and the resulting failure of marked&#13;
increases in urban unemployment and low income wage-employment to emerge.&#13;
Secondly, the reverse links between urban and rural areas, are at the least&#13;
(in Kenya) just as important as the one way rural-urban links emphasized in&#13;
the past. What is more when account is taken of these two way flows, any&#13;
urban bias as exhibited for instance in a very rapid growth of urban formal&#13;
sector employment, need not in any sense be at the expense of other groups&#13;
(particularly those in the rural sector) in the economy. In fact a major&#13;
part of our thesis is that it is the close two-way links between rural small-&#13;
holders and formal sector employees, which in large part have determined the&#13;
pace and extent of rural development in Kenya. Far from sucking in people&#13;
and resources from the rural areas to the latter's detriment, the close rural-&#13;
urban links that we have documented imply that the growth of the urban sector&#13;
has shifted the production possiblity set of the rural sector. Finally, we&#13;
have provided some (admittedly speculative) evidence to suggest that it is&#13;
probably not the growth of capitqlist smallholder agriculture in Kenya which&#13;
1/   [56) page 23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
has led to the concentration of land, which in principle (and as we have&#13;
shown, in practice) by lowering the overall demand for rural labor, damages&#13;
the interest of the rural poor. Instead, it is the growth of a particular&#13;
class of urban incomes (which we discuss in greater detail in the next chap-&#13;
ter) which has boen mainly responsible for land concentration in Kenya. This&#13;
remains the single most important structural source of the rural poverty prob-&#13;
lem, as it leads to landlessness, outmigration to the drylands, and the emerg-&#13;
ing conflict between these outmigrants and the pastoralists (all poor groups,&#13;
by any standard in Kenya), for the meagre and diminishing land resources.&#13;
Finally, we have argued that, at least amongst smallholders there&#13;
is some evidence that, differences in land holding have not been the major&#13;
determinant of household income and hence the incidence of poverty. It was&#13;
the historically determined (relatively random) distribution of education,&#13;
through its effects on the relative ability of different smallholder house-&#13;
holds to obtain the urban-based off-farm income needed to finance smallholder&#13;
innovation, which was the prime determinant of differences in smallholder&#13;
household incomes. As household income and education are now increasingly&#13;
correlated, the relatively benign distributional effects of the past dis-&#13;
tribution of what has turned out to be a major asset viz. education, are&#13;
less likely in the future.&#13;
We turn to an examination of the policy implications flowing from&#13;
this framework of the two-way rural-urban interactions, for poverty redressal&#13;
in Kenya. Before doing so, it may be useful to reiterate that in the type of&#13;
two way rural-urban interactions charted in this chapter the notion of the&#13;
effects of growth "trickling down" is a very limited and highly misleading&#13;
representation of the spread effects of growth. Thus, as we have shown,&#13;
rural innovation has in no sense "trickled down" in Kenya; it is a direct&#13;
function of the growth of urban formal unskilled wage employment and it&#13;
leads simultaneously to increases in income for most of the smallholder&#13;
groups (as it has been diffused across smallholder households irrespective&#13;
of the size of farm), as well as of landless laborers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
IV. Policy Implications&#13;
Broadly speaking, we have identified three crucial processes which&#13;
proximately determine the incidence of poverty (which is mainly rural) in&#13;
Kenya. These are, first, the process of land concentration, which we have&#13;
argued is likely to have been fuelled by the increased demand for land for&#13;
both speculative and retirement purposes by the better educated and richer&#13;
urban classes. Second, there is the process of smallholder innovation, which&#13;
we have argued has been mainly determined by urban-based off-farm income&#13;
obtained from the remittances of unskilled rural-urban migrants in the urban&#13;
formal sector. Thirdly, there is the increased competition for the meagre&#13;
resources on marginal dry lands, between their traditional occupants (the&#13;
pastoralists), and the landless outmigrants from areas of higher agricultural&#13;
potential. The relevant policies must therefore be concerned with either&#13;
halting these processes (in the case of land concentration, and the competi-&#13;
tion for marginal lands), or in promoting their further spread (in the case&#13;
of smallholder innovation). We, therefore, briefly discuss some relevant&#13;
policy options under these three headings in this chapter.&#13;
1.   Arresting Land Concentration&#13;
We can divide up the policy options into those concerning land&#13;
concentration amongst smallholders, and those concerning the problems of the&#13;
large estates. We deal in this section, mainly with the smallholder problem,&#13;
though in the last part we briefly discuss the issues relevant in forming&#13;
judgements on the appropriate policies towards the large farms.&#13;
We have argued that the increased concentration has most likely&#13;
been due to the asset choices of high-income urban groups. We can influence&#13;
these choices through (a) direct intervention in the land market, (b) through&#13;
interest rate policies, and the provision of alternative assets, and (c)&#13;
through reducing the high urban incomes which finance this particular asset&#13;
choice. We examine policies under each of these sub-headings.&#13;
(a) Direct Intervention in the Land Market - Three forms of&#13;
direct intervention in the land market may be considered. These are (i) a&#13;
land tax; (ii) a capital gains tax on land; and (iii) legislative restric-&#13;
tions on absentee ownership of land.&#13;
There are problems of administrative feasibility in the Kenyan&#13;
context, with both the first and last of these options.&#13;
Hence, a capital gains tax on land sales, may be the most&#13;
attractive option because to the extent land purchases are being fuelled&#13;
by speculation in land values, such a tax will tend to reduce the&#13;
expected after-tax rate of return from such speculation. If the tax were&#13;
levied only on land bought and sold after the date of the institution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
the tax, the administrative costs would be lower as compared with a land&#13;
tax, as the authorities would only have to monitor current and future sales&#13;
of land.  The tax would, therefore, only affect those who bought land with&#13;
a view to speculating on its future resale value, and by reducing the return&#13;
to such speculation, it would reduce the speculative demand for land, which&#13;
we have argued is likely to be a major source of land concentration.    A&#13;
further advantage of such a capital gains tax on land will be that to the&#13;
extent it dampens the future rise in land prices, and thereby reduces the&#13;
expected rate of return on speculative current holdings of land, some of&#13;
the latter might be put on the market, thereby reducing the current con-&#13;
centration of land.&#13;
The major drawback of such a tax is that it provides an incen-&#13;
tive for collusive evasion between buyers and sellers and the growth of so-&#13;
called black money markets. This prospect is the likelier, the more the&#13;
speculative demand for land is fed by the rents accruing to certain sections&#13;
of the urban population from various types of protective policies. If, how-&#13;
ever, the proposed tax is combined with policies to reduce the generation of&#13;
these urban rents (see below), then the dangers of such a tax leading to the&#13;
growth of the black money market are likely to be reduced.&#13;
(b) Interest Rate Policy and Alternative Assets - To the extent&#13;
that the speculative demand for land is the result of the high expected&#13;
returns to land as compared with alternative assets, raising the real rate&#13;
of return on alternative assets, as well as the provision of newer high-&#13;
yielding, and socially more productive assets for high income urban residents,&#13;
would also tend to reduce the demand for land. It appears that the real&#13;
return from savings deposits with banks or building societies have been low&#13;
(see Table 48) and in recent years where interest rates have lagged behind&#13;
changes in the price level, are likely to have been negative. This effects&#13;
the demand for land in two ways. First, the relatively low real return on&#13;
alternative assets means that portfolio choices are biased towards holding&#13;
more land. Secondly, as high income urban residents seem to be able to&#13;
borrow at the existing low real interest rates to finance land purchases,&#13;
they have a further incentive (as well as the means) to increase their land&#13;
holdings.&#13;

Year               Inflation       Interest Rates          Interest Rates&#13;

1976                  8.4             - 3.5                  - 1.2&#13;
Source: [10].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
This suggests that raising interest rates on alternative assets&#13;
as well as on borrowing to finance land purchases will have some effect in&#13;
reducing the asset demand for land.&#13;
(c) Urban Income Distribution - High income in the urban sector&#13;
can be affected both through takation which reduces after tax incomes (which&#13;
finance land concentration), as well as through measures which reduce high&#13;
pre-tax incomes.&#13;
There is probably still some scope for raising direct taxes on&#13;
the higher urban income groups. However, the reduction in high pre-tax in-&#13;
comes is likely to be a better way of tackling the problems of high urban&#13;
incomes. This is because a substantial part of these incomes are "rents"&#13;
generated either through the operation of various protective foreign trade&#13;
(and other public) policies, as well as those which accrue to the relatively&#13;
scarce "skills" of more educated labor. To the extent that public policy,&#13;
in particular the high and uneven effective protection provided by the pro-&#13;
tective foreign trade system, generates subsidies to the high-income non-&#13;
wage urban sector (by implicitly taxing other groups in the country), a&#13;
reversal of these inefficient public policies would be highly desirable.&#13;
"Rents" accruing to high income wage-earners are the result of a continuing&#13;
excess demand for relatively more educated African labor. However, there is&#13;
evidence that with the expansion in the supply of the educated labor force,&#13;
these rents are likely to be eroded through the relatively efficient workings&#13;
of the Kenyan urban labor market. Thus, between 1963-74, the wage differen-&#13;
tials between the mean of the top quarter of wage earners and the mean of the&#13;
remaining three-quarters narrowed steadily. The differential was 7.1 in 1963,&#13;
5.9 in 1969 and 4.2 in 1974. Also, within Nairobi, the proportion of wage&#13;
earners receiving below half of the mean wage fell from 50 percent in 1972&#13;
to 47 percent in 1976. Further evidence is provided in Table 49. This sug-&#13;
gests that with the expansion of the educated labor force, and the resulting&#13;
relative wage adjustments in the urban labor market, the rents from better&#13;
education have, and are likely to continue to decline.&#13;
By contrast, as the protection regime was tightened in the early&#13;
1970's we would infer that over time, the urban rents which in large part&#13;
are financing increased land concentraton have come to be based primarily&#13;
on the monopoly profits generated by the protection regime rather than on&#13;
education. A reduction in protection is, therefore, an important means for&#13;
reducing the rents for high income urban residents, and thereby arresting&#13;
their demand for land.&#13;

Furthermore, to the extent that the erosion of rents from education&#13;
depends upon a continuing expansion of the supply of the better educated, cur-&#13;
rent attempts to restrict the growth of secondary education would not seem&#13;
to be well conceived. Whilst a case can be made for reducing public subsi-&#13;
dies to education (not related to financial needs), there does not seem to&#13;
be much of a case for not meeting the private demand for fee-paying education.&#13;
Ideally, public subsidies to education should be confined to providing access&#13;
for the poor. If some means-tested system of educational subsidies is not&#13;
feasible,. as a second best (because of the equity aspects), some general pub-&#13;
lic subsidies to education may be desirable.&#13;

(d) Policies Towards Large Farms - Large farms in Kenya are a&#13;
ure of farms owned by individuals, private and public companies, and&#13;
eratives. They are also the refuge for a large but uncertain number&#13;
_ quatters.  The undesirability of breaking up these large estates depends&#13;
cruically upon the existence of economies of scale in the cash crop agricul-&#13;
ture in which these farms specialise. The evidence on the existence and ex-&#13;
tent of these economies of scale seems inconclusive at present. What does&#13;
seem odd is the legal prohibition on sales of land which would break up&#13;
these large estates. For, if the presumed economies of scale do exist, they&#13;
would be sufficient to provide private investors with an incentive to keep&#13;
the optimum sized large estates intact. There seems to be little reason why&#13;
this should be reinforced by any legal prohibition. Finally, to the extent&#13;
that some of these estates are held for speculative purposes, the proposed&#13;
capital gains tax on land sales would tend to reduce both the speculative&#13;
gains from current holdings, as well as dampen future speculative demand.&#13;
2.   Promoting Smallholder Innovation&#13;
We have argued that at present the major determinant of small-&#13;
holder inovation is the easing of financial constraints through access to&#13;
urban-based off-farm income earning opportunites. The policies for pro-&#13;
moting smallholder innovation can therefore be classified into (a) those&#13;
which provide greater and more equal access to urban-based formal sector&#13;
jobs to the poorer smallholder rural-urban migrants, and (b) those which&#13;
provide a supplement to the on-farm income flows, which by themselves are&#13;
usually insufficient to finance smallholder innovation.     We deal with&#13;
potential policies in both areas in this section.&#13;
(a) Access to Urban Formal Sector Jobs - The relative growth&#13;
of formal sector jobs in Nairobi as compared with all other urban areas was&#13;
5.1% versus 3.1% in the period 1967-76. This has meant that the Central&#13;
Province smallholders have had much greater access to urban formal sector&#13;
job opportunities, than those in Nyanza and Western Province. Thus in 1976,&#13;
there were 254,000 formal urban sector wage-employees in Nairobi and Central&#13;
Province, as compared with only 22,000 in Nyanza and Western Provinces. Fur-&#13;
thermore, despite the fact that the smallholder population in Western and&#13;
Nyanza Provinces is twice that in Central Province, the increase in formal&#13;
sector wage employment in Nairobi and Central Province between 1967-76 was&#13;
76,000 as compared with only 6,000 in Nyanza and Western Province. This&#13;
suggests that industrial location policy could have important effects in&#13;
equalizing the regional distribution of urban formal sector job opportuni-&#13;
ties.&#13;
To promote this regional dispersion of industry a regionally&#13;
differentiated system of marginal employment allowances, a variant on a&#13;
suggestion by A. Kervin could be considered. "Any corporation would be&#13;
entitled to deduct from its taxable income a flat amount per additional&#13;
person employed. For a new venture, it would work like an investment&#13;
allowance. The incentive given to investment would be the same, if it&#13;
carried average capital intensity. It would be higher if labor intensity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
were above average, lower in the opposite case. The same rate would apply&#13;
to existing firms, with two provisos: (i) in the case of merger or acqui-&#13;
sition, an allowance can be claimed only if employment increases beyond what&#13;
was provided by the separate firms; (ii) in the case of variations in the&#13;
labor force, any rebate claimed for an increase in employment would have to be&#13;
based on an increase from the level for which a previous claim was based." 1/&#13;
This employment allowance would be regionally differentiated and would replace&#13;
existing tax holidays and investment subsidies. Apart from promoting regional&#13;
unskilled formal sector employment, such a regionally diversified employment&#13;
allowance, would also entail a desirable redistribution of implicit public&#13;
subsidies to industry towards the relatively poorer regions. Such an employ-&#13;
ment allowance would be relatively simple to operate, as it would not require&#13;
any information on payrolls or capital stock, and it would subsidise marginal&#13;
increases in unskilled labor employed.&#13;
Furthermore, to the extent that industrial location decisions are&#13;
influenced by economies of agglomeration, which in turn depend upon the provi-&#13;
sion of various public services, the regional provision of industrial infra-&#13;
structure will also be an important policy instrument in obtaining a regional&#13;
diversification of Kenyan industry. Table 50 shows that the per capita re-&#13;
gional distribution of public expenditure on roads as well as public recurrent&#13;
expenditure, is very unequally distributed, with Nairobi getting the lion's&#13;
share of per capita recurrent public expenditure. 2/ Western Province and&#13;
Nyanza do worse than both Nairobi and Central Province. There is a strong&#13;
case, therefore, for changing the regional composition of infrastructural&#13;
public expenditure.&#13;

Whilst the above measures will to some extent equalize (and&#13;
increase) formal sector job opportunities across regions, there is still the&#13;
problem that the ability to seize these opportunities is likely to depend&#13;
upon levels of education, and hence if access to these job opportunities is&#13;
to be diversified, the distribution of education and opportunities will also&#13;
have to be improved. This entails problems concerning both the access to, as&#13;
well as the quality of education currently available to the rural poor.&#13;
This is of some importance, for the processes whereby the effects&#13;
of urban growth were fairly rapidly transmitted to the Central Province small-&#13;
holders, through the two way rural-urban interactions identified in Chapter 3,&#13;
cannot be counted upon to work in the spread of the growth impulse in the&#13;
other regions, without a diffusion of public education. Table 51 shows that,&#13;
on a per capita basis, public expenditure on secondary education is low both&#13;
in absolute and relative terms in the poorer regions.    At the least, the&#13;
Government should consider raising the per capita development expenditure on&#13;
education in the other regions to its current levels in Central Province.&#13;

(b) Promoting Alternative Methods of Financing Innovation - Though&#13;
we have emphasized the importance of urban-based off-farm income as a major&#13;
determinant of smallholder innovation, there are other ways in which the&#13;
financial constraint on innovation (particularly amongst the poorer small-&#13;
holders) could be eased. Though rural credit might seem to be the obvious&#13;
way out, it appears that in Kenya there are good reasons, as noted in Chapter&#13;
3, why both the ability and willingness to borrow are linked to the urban-&#13;
based off-farm income flows of smallholder households. Therefore, thougl&#13;
some increase in financing smallholder innovation through increased rural&#13;
credit may well be possible, we would not expect this to provide a major&#13;
substitute for urban-based off-farm income in the finance of innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Another alternative would be to give cash grants for expenditure&#13;
on innovation to the poorer smallholders. Besides the obvious administrative&#13;
problems with such a policy, there is also the extra budgetary cost which&#13;
needs to be taken into account. To minimize the latter, it maybe desirable&#13;
to convert part of the current budget on extension services into cash grants&#13;
for the poorer smallholders. It is likely that the current extension services&#13;
are biased toward the richer farmers, whilst to the extent that the poorer&#13;
farmers cannot get access to funds to finance innovation, the availability of&#13;
extension services for them would seem to be irrelevant. It might, therefore,&#13;
be worth using part of the extension budget to provide cash grants to the&#13;
poorer smallholders.&#13;
3.   Policies for Alleviating Pastoralist Poverty&#13;
The various policy measures discussed in the previous two sections&#13;
should go some way towards alleviating the poverty of poor smallholders as&#13;
well as the landless, (of the latter through arresting concentration of land&#13;
and hence the diminuition in demand for hired labor, and through more rapid&#13;
smallholder innovation and its associated increase in the demand for hired&#13;
labor). This leaves the pastoralists as the final major poverty group for&#13;
whom we need to find some methods of poverty redressal. These policies are&#13;
essentially concerned with both reducing the competition for the meagre&#13;
resources of the pastoralist areas from landless outmigrants from the other&#13;
regions, as well as raising the productivity of the traditional occupations&#13;
of the pastoralists.&#13;
This implies that the first policy could be to-restrict the migra-&#13;
tion of the landless from the other agricultural areas into the dry lands.&#13;
Apart from reducing the pressure on the existing land resources in these&#13;
areas, this will also prevent the introduction of inapprorpiate farming&#13;
techniques, which as we saw in Chapter 3, are increasingly leading to soil&#13;
erosion, and hence a reduction in the cultivable area. As emphasized above,&#13;
the problem of the landless will have to be solved by the policies which re-&#13;
duce land concentration, promote smallholder innovation, and faster growth&#13;
in urban wage employment. Their free outmigration to the drylands does not&#13;
solve their poverty problem, and worsens that of the pastoralists. Restric-&#13;
tions of such migration would thus seem justified.&#13;
Two measures seem important for raising the current low levels&#13;
of income of pastoralists. These low levels are chiefly the result of over-&#13;
grazing, which in turn is caused by the large and uneconomic size of the&#13;
herds of the pastoralists. These over-large herds in turn reflect the lack&#13;
of internalisation of the external diseconomies from overgrazing, what, in&#13;
effect, is public land, as well as the traditional asset preference of the&#13;
Masai for cattle. The Government's policies to encourage the privatisation&#13;
of land through group ranching are, therefore, wholly desirable in off-&#13;
setting the current incentives to overgrazing. Furthermore, it appears that&#13;
the traditional attitude towards holding cattle as an asset may be changing.&#13;
Thus, traditionally the Masai have increased herd size at the onset of a&#13;
drought, presumably in the hope that a larger total number of cattle would,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
for any given proportion of the herd which was decimated by the drought, still&#13;
leave an absolutely larger number of post-drought cattle, than if the herd&#13;
size had not been increased. However, Campbell t8] found that, during the&#13;
most recent drought, there seems to have been a generational split amongst the&#13;
Masai in terms of recognizing the relative superiority of money as an asset.&#13;
Thus Campbell reports that whereas nearly all the Masai below 35 years old&#13;
were for reducing the herd size at the onset of the drought, the older Masai&#13;
wanted to follow exactly the reverse policy. It seems, therefore, that over&#13;
time the Masai will come to take a more 'modern' attitude towards the rela-&#13;
tive merits of money and cattle as assets, and hence the traditional tendency&#13;
towards overstocking which has been uneconomic will be reversed.&#13;
Thus there are a number of policy options which could arrest the&#13;
malign and aid the benign processes we have identified as being the major&#13;
determinants of the extent of poverty redressal in Kenya in the recent past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Appendix 1: Poverty Lines&#13;
Any income level which defines the criterion for "poverty" is essen-&#13;
tially arbitrary. The purpose of such an exercise is not to reveal how many&#13;
people are poor (almost all Kenyan smallholders are poor according to Western&#13;
usage of the word), but rather to be able to compare one rural group with&#13;
another group which is better off. We may then pose two revealing questions;&#13;
why it is that some localities have a far higher incidence of poverty than&#13;
others, and why, within a locality, some households have incomes very much&#13;
higher than our poverty group. Thus the important attribute of a poverty&#13;
income line is that an adequate sample size should be retained on either side&#13;
of the line and a viable but significant poverty group identified for policy&#13;
purposes. A rival approach to the concept of a poverty line is to identify&#13;
some minimum required standard of nutrition; the income level at which food&#13;
purchases attain this standard serving as the povery line. Fortunately, in&#13;
Kenya the poverty lines suggested by these alternative approaches coincide.&#13;
The household income level of 2,000 shillings per annum assigns 30% of the&#13;
smallholder population to poverty and is a class limit in IRS 1. It thus&#13;
yields adequate sample sizes and does not pose data problems. Thorbecke,&#13;
[90], adopts a nutritional approach and deduces a critical level of house-&#13;
hold income of 2,050 s.p.a. at 1974 rural prices.&#13;
Applied to urban households, correcting for differences in price&#13;
levels and household size, only a very small percentage of households were&#13;
poor. In order to make intra-urban comparisons it was therefore necessary&#13;
to use a much higher poverty line in order to get a reasonable sample size.&#13;
This urban "poverty" line was set at roughtly twice the national poverty line&#13;
(see [39a], Appendix 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Appendix 2: The Innovation Index&#13;
Innovation might involve a change in technology for a given product&#13;
or a switch in the product mix. The former is measured by our data from IRS-I&#13;
on expenditure on farm inputs. The latter could be measured by area of land,&#13;
number of crop units or crop yields. We were constrained by data availability&#13;
to choose crop units (e.g. trees), but this is in any case probably the most&#13;
reliably measured survey data of the three possibilities.&#13;
Crop numbers data was limited to coffee trees, tea trees, cashewnut&#13;
trees, coconut trees, and numbers of livestock (improved or unimproved meas-&#13;
ured in "livestock sampling units" (LSU) which were adjusted for age and&#13;
type of stock). One major omission among innovatory crops was hybrid maize;&#13;
however, intensive studies of the adoption of hybrid maize have concluded&#13;
that the major constraint on further adoption is ecological rather than eco-&#13;
nomic. Coconuts and cashews are non-existent outside Coast Province so we&#13;
were left with tea and coffee trees. Other omissions were pyrethrum (grown&#13;
in Nyanza and Central but not Western or Coast) and cotton (grown only in&#13;
Nyanza and Western). Tea and coffee are common to Nyanza, Central and West-&#13;
ern but not Coast. With livestock it was clear that only the possession of&#13;
improved livestock could be regarded as an innovation. We therefore had the&#13;
task of building an innovation index as some composite of coffee trees, tea&#13;
trees and improved livestock.&#13;
The IRS valued a LSU at 1,100 shillings. If we get an approximate&#13;
value of mature coffee and tea trees by estimating their present value at&#13;
four times their annual income, then a coffee tree would be 115 shillings and&#13;
a tea tree 15 shillings so that the weights assigned to the three components&#13;
of the innovation index were tea tree = 1, coffee tree = 10, LSU = 74.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Chapters 1 and 2 of this paper provide
            an empirical investigation of trends in poverty and income
            distribution in Kenya between 1963 and 1974, differentiated
            by region and occuption. Chapter 3 provides a framework for
            explaining these trends in terms of the pattern of growth,
            and in particular emphasizes the two way rural-urban
            interactions which largely explain the "spread"
            effects of growth in Kenya. Chapter 4 derives some policy
            conclusions on how future growth could be made to yield even
            higher degrees of poverty redressal.
