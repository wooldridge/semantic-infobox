            It would be hard to disagree with the
            objectives of the international aid industry. But how much
            are donors contributing to their achievement? Despite recent
            progress, we still know surprisingly little. We know that
            some donors give much more than others relative to income.
            We also know that donors are focusing aid less on poor
            countries and more on countries with strong institutions or
            good policies. And we know that there appears to be no
            tradeoff here: the countries that give the most aid also
            target poor countries and those with good policies. Yet we
            are still in the dark about which donors, or which projects,
            are achieving the best results.
