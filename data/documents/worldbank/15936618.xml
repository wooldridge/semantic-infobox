                THE CHAIRMAN:      The meeting will please come to order.&#13;
&#13;
                 I am sure you will recall that when the Board was&#13;
&#13;
            informed of the circumstances involving our taking under&#13;
&#13;
            consideration the power loans in Japan a discussion arose&#13;
&#13;
            regarding the economic situation of Japan.     At that time the&#13;
&#13;
            suggestion was made that it might be desirable, though not&#13;
&#13;
            in accordance with usual procedure, to have some discussion&#13;
&#13;
            of the economic situation of Japan take place before the&#13;
&#13;
            loans were submitted.     After some delays which were longer&#13;
&#13;
            than we expected, the economic report was forwarded to the&#13;
&#13;
            Directors, with the notation that if any of the Directors&#13;
&#13;
            would like to have such discussion we would be prepared to&#13;
&#13;
            have it.   We received indications that at least one or two&#13;
&#13;
            Directors thought that was useful, so we called this meeting.&#13;
&#13;
                 I would like to say that there is no loan before the&#13;
&#13;
            Board at the moment.     Therefore, the questions to be disÂ­&#13;
&#13;
            cussed today are not in any way prejudicial when at some&#13;
&#13;
            future time loans are before the Board.&#13;
    ,&#13;
    I,&#13;
    'I&#13;
    II&#13;
                 As a matter of inf'ormation, the management is carrying&#13;
    i[&#13;
    II      f'orward negotiations and is expecting wi thin a period of' two&#13;
    I:

    il      or three weeks, depending upon completion of the pro ject

&#13;

&#13;
 i": 	 This is a discussion of the Japanese economic situation, so&#13;
 il&#13;
&#13;
 Ii that there will be full opportunity for consideration of any&#13;
 ldi points made in the discussion in the interval between now and&#13;
&#13;
 I: the time those loans are presented.&#13;
 !! 	&#13;
 Ii&#13;
&#13;
              I might also mention one point with regard to the loans,&#13;
&#13;
 !I&#13;
 ,       which is the question of the purchase of equipment, the terms&#13;
I on which the equipment is being bought from two U. S.&#13;
 'i,,'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I suppliers.         That was discussed, and I think an explanation&#13;
Ii&#13;
I: 	 was made, verbally at least, as to the basis on whi ch those&#13;
Ii 
&#13;
Ii arrangements had been made before we got into the situation. 
&#13;
i'&#13;
I' 	 The Canadian Director discussed that, and we wrote him and&#13;
I:&#13;
I;&#13;
I: 	 sent him copies of a memorandum which was prepared by our&#13;
II&#13;
ii Technical Operations Department, telling the background of&#13;
"	&#13;
&#13;
B&#13;
Ii&#13;
r 	t hese negotiations and pointing out that before the loans&#13;
(&#13;
jI 	     came to us for consideration letters of contract had been&#13;
1:&#13;
I: 	 signed by the power companies with these two suppliers, and&#13;
i&#13;
i	       that our determination or information indicated that the&#13;
I,&#13;
i, equipment prices were reasonable for their purposes, and that&#13;
I	&#13;
!&#13;
,I 	&#13;
         is a situation similar to that which has occurred in many&#13;
&#13;
Ii prior cases where we have entered the situation after agree-&#13;
II&#13;
Ii ments for equipment have been entered into between the buyer&#13;
If&#13;
I&#13;
i: 	 and the seller.      We have in all cases reviewed those agree-&#13;
,&#13;
I'&#13;
I,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I: ments, but if we found them satisfactory we have not attempted&#13;
!&#13;
I:&#13;
I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   5&#13;
         to insist on the abrogation of already existing contracts and&#13;
&#13;
    li': the opening up of bidding.&#13;
Ii&#13;
!i  I!        I might also on that point say that we have been preparin$&#13;

p&#13;
&#13;
IiI',: information covering the whole manner of contractual arrange-&#13;
II&#13;
         ments on all of the loans that we have made.   That is in the&#13;
Ii,&#13;
II&#13;
II stage of finalization for distribution to the Directors. I&#13;
II&#13;
II hope it will be available within the next week or ten days,&#13;
II&#13;
Ii&#13;
!I and will set forth the facts regarding the methods used for&#13;
n&#13;
    Ii&#13;
II contracting for purchasing under all the loans and will&#13;
&#13;
\1&#13;
    'I&#13;
         attempt to set forth the principles that the Bank has followed&#13;
!I&#13;
 i and the various considerations we take into account, dependÂ­&#13;
 'I&#13;
II&#13;
q ing upon the various facts in each situation.   I hope you will&#13;
iI,l&#13;
[I have that study within a short time and that, as someone&#13;
I suggested, we might have a discussion of that, not as applied&#13;
!        to any particular loan but as applied to general Bank practice&#13;
i&#13;
                                                                          l
&#13;
Ili           I might say that that study shows that competitive&#13;
[:&#13;
i'Il bidding in its fullest sense is where a project starts, issues&#13;
Ii&#13;
Ii       invitations for tenders, and buys on pure competitive bidding. I&#13;
II&#13;
II It has been the exception rather than the rule in our opera-&#13;
II                                                                        I&#13;
I, tions, and certainly I think in the very large majority of             I&#13;
i&#13;
I,&#13;
Ii pro ject loans prior arrangements to some extent at least&#13;
I&#13;
II have been made before we got into the picture, and we have to&#13;
II&#13;
,&#13;
i take that into account.&#13;
i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II            That information will be available, and I simply wanted&#13;
&#13;
II to bring up that point because it was discussed at some&#13;
&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
II&#13;
&amp;#12;!                                                                6&#13;

I:&#13;
Ii                                                                    I&#13;
iiwould like to make a brief statement and then ask Mr. de Wilde, I&#13;
&#13;
iiwhO as you know spent substantial time in Japan before I went       .&#13;
I,                                                                    I&#13;
Iiout and who has been chiefly responsible for the preparation        I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
iiof this report, to make some remarks.                               I&#13;
&#13;
Ii,i&#13;
I&#13;
                                                                      I'&#13;
          In the beginning I would like to outline quite frankly&#13;
i~                                                                    I&#13;
I,the management's attitude and approach to thi s Japanese            I&#13;
&#13;
Ii problem.                                                           ,I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I:&#13;
i,       First, we are, just as you gentlemen are, conscious of       I&#13;
&#13;
I:the problems in the Japanese economy.      There are great problemsi&#13;
i:                                                                    I&#13;
Ii,I there.   We have tried in the economic report frankly to lay&#13;
it&#13;
ilthem out and to appraise them objectively.&#13;
I:&#13;
                                                  There are such&#13;
if&#13;
II&#13;
Ii problems as their balance of payments, building up new markets,&#13;
Ii&#13;
Ii new sources of supply.     They cover some of the very evident&#13;
p&#13;
llrisks in lending.&#13;
!I&#13;
I&#13;
          Now, we take risks in every loan we make, as we appraise&#13;
I the&#13;
I        situation; but in a world such as it is today it is rather&#13;
I&#13;
ihard to find a place where one says they do not exist, either&#13;
,&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
Ii&#13;
II 
&#13;
II 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             7
&#13;
tangible or intangible risks.   The extent of those risks,&#13;
&#13;
the judgment as to how great they are, and in the face of&#13;
&#13;
those how far the Bank can go, are things that I think it is&#13;
&#13;
the job of the management and Directors of this Bank to&#13;
&#13;
appraise.&#13;
&#13;
     r think it is fair to say that certainly Japan is a very&#13;
important country and an important member of this Bank; that&#13;
&#13;
its importance lies not only in its very key position in the&#13;
&#13;
East, in the whole area of the Pacific, but its importance is&#13;
&#13;
very great to most of the members of this Bank in greater or&#13;
&#13;
lesser degree.   What happens to Japan, moving forward&#13;
&#13;
economically and financially with stability, on the one hand,&#13;
&#13;
can be a force of great value in the world; on the other&#13;
&#13;
hand, a Japan that is economically weak and is not making&#13;
&#13;
progress can represent a soft spot in the world.&#13;
&#13;
     So we came to the conclusion that it would be an extreme&#13;
&#13;
position to say that the risks in Japan, the risks as to how&#13;
&#13;
Japan can over a period service dollar loans, were so great&#13;
&#13;
that we could do nothing in Japan.   That seemed to us to be&#13;
&#13;
an extreme position and to be going further than we have gone&#13;
&#13;
in many other cases where we have made loans.    Secondly,&#13;
&#13;
aside from the very evident tangible factors of unbalanced&#13;
&#13;
trade, of her lack of raw materials, there are some very&#13;
&#13;
important factors that one has to look at in balancing the&#13;
&#13;
picture.    One of those factors you can say is that Japan&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                8
&#13;
has shown in the past the tremendous power and energy of her&#13;
&#13;
people, the determination of her people, and the discipline&#13;
&#13;
which they have accepted in accomplishing their objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Those are factors to which one has to give great weight.&#13;
&#13;
Further, I think Japan 1 s record in meeting her financial&#13;
&#13;
obligations over a long period of time is one that compares&#13;
&#13;
favorably with that of almost any country.        That has to be&#13;
&#13;
, gi ven weight.&#13;
&#13;
          The positive factors in the situation are of considerable&#13;
&#13;
 importance.       rrhe negative factors in the situation are also&#13;
&#13;
of conSiderable importance.        It has been our job to try to&#13;
&#13;
 lay those out frankly, and therefore some of the presentation&#13;
&#13;
,in this report certainly raises questions.       These are problems&#13;
&#13;
'which are going to require very positive and active handling&#13;
&#13;
 on the part of Japan.       It is also going to require cooperation&#13;
&#13;
 and help from other sources, one of those sources being the&#13;
&#13;
. Bank.&#13;
&#13;
          The points of general policy are very important, the&#13;
&#13;
 policies that the Japanese Government follows in meeting some&#13;
&#13;
 of these risks.&#13;
&#13;
          I think most of you are aware that I spoke quite&#13;
&#13;
 frankly when I was in Japan in pointing out some of the things&#13;
&#13;
 that seemed to me to be necessary in the way of financial and&#13;
&#13;
 economic policy on the part of the Japanese Government if&#13;
&#13;
 certain of these problems are going to be solved.        I can say&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                9
&#13;
that I was given the most courteous attention, and many&#13;
&#13;
representatives of Japan since then have said that they would&#13;
&#13;
be glad to have the Bank frankly express its opinion and have&#13;
&#13;
expressed the belief that the Bankts opinion will be given due&#13;
&#13;
weight.&#13;
&#13;
      I think one of the considerations that we have taken into&#13;
&#13;
account is that we may be able to be of some help in supportÂ­&#13;
&#13;
ing the constructive elements there, and that that is one of&#13;
&#13;
the   rea~ons   that we are justified in extending reasonable&#13;
&#13;
amounts of financial aid.&#13;
&#13;
      With that general preliminary, I would like to ask&#13;
&#13;
Mr. de Wilde briefly to comment on some of the high pOints&#13;
&#13;
of this report.     While you have read it, I think it is&#13;
&#13;
someti~es   helpful to have the author give a brief summary&#13;
&#13;
and also comment on some of the developments that we have&#13;
&#13;
seen at a distance since the report was written, and a few&#13;
&#13;
remarks in addition.&#13;
&#13;
       MR. de WILDE:    In many respects I think the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
economy has shown in the postwar years a rather impressive&#13;
&#13;
record of accomplishment, and that should always be kept in&#13;
&#13;
mind in an appraisal of the situation.      If one looks, for&#13;
&#13;
example, at production, one must take note of the fact that&#13;
&#13;
industrial production in 1952 was about 140 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
normal prewar period, namely, 1934 to 1936, and that in the&#13;
&#13;
first half of 1953 new postwar records in the field of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              10 
&#13;
industrial production were set.   Agricultural production&#13;
&#13;
perhaps has not soared similarly, but even so agricultural&#13;
&#13;
production is somewhat in excess of prewar levels.     In general:&#13;
&#13;
it may be said that per capita production and consumption&#13;
&#13;
in the Japanese economy is about at prewar levels or perhaps&#13;
&#13;
slightly in excess thereof.   Moreover, there has been war&#13;
&#13;
damage which was very extensive in Japan, which has been&#13;
&#13;
virtually completely rehabilitated, and the economy has shown&#13;
&#13;
in general in the postwar period a very high rate of&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
     The balance of payments, at least until this year, has&#13;
&#13;
been favorable.   In the last three years, from 1950 to 1952,&#13;
&#13;
inclusive, there was a consistent surplus of foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
reserves over expenditures, which was in excess of $300&#13;
&#13;
million equivalent in each of the last three years.    This&#13;
&#13;
has enabled Japan to build up a foreign exchange reserve&#13;
&#13;
of somewheres in the nature of $1 billion, of which well&#13;
&#13;
over $800 million is in gold and dollars.&#13;
&#13;
     I think these accomplishments, which are very real, are&#13;
&#13;
all the more remarkable in view of the fact that Japan has&#13;
&#13;
had to contend with enormous difficulties after the war.       It&#13;
&#13;
not only suffered very heavy war damage but it suffered very&#13;
&#13;
severe territorial losses, and in the postwar period it&#13;
&#13;
suffered pretty largely the loss of access to the neighboring&#13;
&#13;
Asiatic continent because of developments there and therefore&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  11 
&#13;
    lost virtually all access to markets and sources of supply 
&#13;
&#13;
i   which in 1938, the prewar peak year, had taken about 60 
&#13;
&#13;
    percent of Japanese exports and furnished about 40 percent 
&#13;
&#13;
    of her imports. 
&#13;
&#13;
         Moreover, at present her population of around eighty-Six&#13;
&#13;
    million is no less than 19 percent in excess of the prewar&#13;
&#13;
    levels, both as a result of repatriation of Japanese from&#13;
&#13;
    overseas and the natural growth in the population.&#13;
&#13;
         So you see, despite these obstacles there has been a very&#13;
&#13;
    impressive postwar record of recovery.   This record I think is&#13;
&#13;
. certainly in large measure due to the energy and resourcefulÂ­&#13;
&#13;
    ness of the Japanese people, to which Mr. Garner has already&#13;
&#13;
    referred.   At the same time, I think one should acknowledge&#13;
&#13;
    that this record would have been impossible of achievement&#13;
&#13;
    if it had not been for the substantial support of the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
    economy by the United States.   Up to the end of the fiscal&#13;
&#13;
    year 1951, this support took the form of Congressional&#13;
&#13;
    appropriations for the purchase of supplies, civilian goods,&#13;
&#13;
    which were furnished to the economy -- foodstuffs, raw&#13;
&#13;
    materials, and so forth.   Since the end of the fiscal year&#13;
&#13;
    1951 there have been no further direct Congressional&#13;
&#13;
    appropriations for the support of the Japanese economy, but&#13;
&#13;
    the Japanese economy has continued to earn a very large&#13;
&#13;
    amount of foreign exchange from several sources.     One of&#13;
&#13;
    these sources has been the expenditures of the large amount&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                12 
&#13;
&#13;
    of U. S. military and also to some extent civilian personnel&#13;
&#13;
    in Japan.   Another important source has been the procurement&#13;
&#13;
    in connection with the Korean war effort, and to a minor&#13;
&#13;
    extent procurement in Japan for the mutual security program.&#13;
&#13;
    From these sources Japan has derived certainly an enormous&#13;
&#13;
    amount of foreign exchange.   In 1952 , the revenues from these&#13;
I&#13;
: sources which I have alluded to amounted to roughly $800&#13;
&#13;
    million, a not inconsiderable sum.    In the light of that, one&#13;
&#13;
    must, of course, acknowledge that without these sources of&#13;
&#13;
    funds accruing to the Japanese economy the Japanese economy&#13;
&#13;
    would have shown, letts say, a balance of payments deficit&#13;
&#13;
    of roughly a little over $5 0 0 million in 1952, and an actual&#13;
&#13;
    deficit with the dollar area of roughly $600 million.&#13;
&#13;
         One cannot necessarily presuppose that these revenues&#13;
&#13;
    of special dollar income will precipitately decline even now&#13;
&#13;
    that the Korean hostilities have come to an end.    I think it&#13;
&#13;
    is fairly safe to assume that over the next few years they&#13;
&#13;
    will still be maintained at a fairly high level.    While of&#13;
&#13;
    course procurement in connection with the war effort will&#13;
&#13;
    slacken off fairly rapidly, although there is still a large&#13;
&#13;
    number of outstanding contracts, nevertheless to a very large&#13;
&#13;
    extent there will be new procurement for the considerable'&#13;
    program of Korean rehabilitation, rehabilitation of the Korean&#13;
&#13;
    economy, which is already underway.    Moreoever, I think&#13;
&#13;
    probably the disbursements by U. S. personnel in Japan will&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             13 
&#13;
 remain at a very high level, so that for some years at least&#13;
&#13;
 I think it is safe to prophecy that there will be a considerÂ­&#13;
&#13;
able continued income from these sources.    This, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
gives the Japanese economy an opportunity to try and find&#13;
&#13;
 solutions to some of the more fundamental problems and bring&#13;
&#13;
 about a progressively better equilibrium in her income and&#13;
&#13;
outgo, independent of these special sources of income which&#13;
&#13;
Â· it is enjoying at present.   So necessarily the mission which&#13;
&#13;
Â· was in Japan in the closing months of 1952 spent a great deal&#13;
&#13;
of time in discussing with Japanese experts and officials&#13;
&#13;
 the whole problem of how Japan was to bring about better&#13;
&#13;
equilibrium in its balance of payments, both in the over-all&#13;
&#13;
 sense and particularly with the dollar area.&#13;
&#13;
      What are the fundamental problems that have to be solved?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢Well, for one thing Japan has suffered from what you might&#13;
&#13;
 call certain structural changes in world trade.    There has&#13;
&#13;
 been a very sharp decline in the volume of textile imports.&#13;
&#13;
 This has hit Japan very hard, because in the prewar period&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat over 50 percent of Japanese exports consisted of&#13;
&#13;
 textiles of all sorts, including cotton textiles, rayons,&#13;
&#13;
 and raw silk and the like.    Cotton fabrics, cotton cloth in&#13;
&#13;
 particular, have been hard hit, both because'of the over-all&#13;
&#13;
 shrinkage of the world market and particularly to some extent&#13;
&#13;
 as the result of a decline in the standard of living in some&#13;
&#13;
 of the underdeveloped areas in which Japan has traditionally&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  14 
&#13;
     marketed its cotton cloth, as, for example, Indonesia.      The 
&#13;
&#13;
      postwar exports of cotton cloth in 1952 were only about 25 
&#13;
&#13;
      percent of what they were in the prewar period. 
&#13;
&#13;
           There has been a very sharp decline in raw silk exports&#13;
      as a result of the replacement of silk by various synthetiCS,&#13;
&#13;
      and it has particularly affected its balance of payments with&#13;
&#13;
. the dollar area, where much of this silk was formerly&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢. 	 marketed.&#13;
&#13;
           So much then for some of the structural changes in world&#13;
&#13;
      trade.&#13;
&#13;
           Then there was a loss of the neighboring Asiatic market,&#13;
&#13;
      to which I have already alluded, and which made it necessary&#13;
&#13;
 i	   for Japan to seek new markets elsewhere in fields in which it&#13;
&#13;
      had formerly not greatly competed.   In addition, there was the&#13;
&#13;
      factor that there was a shortage of foodstuffs and raw&#13;
&#13;
      materials in the postwar period in the non-dollar areas,&#13;
&#13;
      and this made it necessary, particularly in the field of foodÂ­&#13;
&#13;
      stuffs, for Japan to import an increasing proportion of&#13;
&#13;
      foodstuffs -- grain, soybeans, and the like -- from the dollar&#13;
&#13;
      area, foodstuffs which she had formerly obtained from the&#13;
&#13;
      non-dollar areas, the sterling area, for example, and on the&#13;
&#13;
      ASiatic mainland.&#13;
&#13;
           The combined effect of these factors has been this:&#13;
&#13;
      First of all, as the result of the fact that she has lost&#13;
&#13;
If    access to the neighboring Asiatic mainland and has had to go&#13;
il&#13;
!~&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   15&#13;
       farther afield for the purchase of bulky raw materials, such&#13;
&#13;
       as iron ore, coke and coal, and so forth, the cost structure&#13;
&#13;
       of her industry has been adversely affected, particularly the&#13;
&#13;
       cost structure of the iron and steel industry and the machinery&#13;
&#13;
       and general engineering industries.     Secondly, there has been&#13;
&#13;
       a shift in the imports as compared with the prewar years&#13;
&#13;
       towards the dollar area.     On top of that, there has been the&#13;
&#13;
       effect of the high rate of investment in Japan, which has&#13;
&#13;
       necessarily sustained a relatively high rate of imports in&#13;
&#13;
       relation to exports.&#13;
&#13;
               In the light of these factors, what are the prospects&#13;
&#13;
       for an improvement in the balance of payments within the next&#13;
&#13;
       five years?    vfuen we were in Japan, we got the Japanese to&#13;
&#13;
       prepare for us a prognosis of the balance of payments, letts&#13;
&#13;
       say, in approximately five years t time, to see how it would&#13;
&#13;
       look.     Then we sat down with them to discuss this balance of&#13;
&#13;
       payments.     They came to the conclusion at that time that by&#13;
&#13;
       1957 approximately it would be possible to reduce the balance&#13;
&#13;
       of payments deficit -- as I say again, I am talking independent!&#13;
                                                                          I&#13;
                                                                          ,&#13;
       of these special sources of dollar income -- to approximately&#13;
&#13;
       the equivalent of $300 million, as against, as I indicated&#13;
&#13;
I      before, a balance of payments deficit of somewhat in excess&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IIII   of $500 million in 1952 â&#128;¢&#13;
II             We ourselves in analyzing this felt perhaps that there&#13;
,I&#13;
       was a certain degree of optimism being reflected in this and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       16 
&#13;
        perhaps the deficit might still remain somewhat closer to&#13;
&#13;
        $400 million rather than $300 million.     But I think we are&#13;
&#13;
        aware of the difficulties in forecasts of this sort.       I think&#13;
&#13;
        the main thing you can say is that there would still be in&#13;
&#13;
i       five years' time perhaps a considerable residual deficit,&#13;
&#13;
        judging from the way things are likely to go.      ThiS, of course,&#13;
&#13;
        involves certain structural changes in Japanese trade.        It&#13;
&#13;
        involves certain assumptions as to the gradual development of&#13;
&#13;
        economic ties between Southeast ASia and Japan.       It involves&#13;
&#13;
        certain assumptions regarding an increase in the production of&#13;
&#13;
        foodstuffs in Japan proper.    I might add also that it involves&#13;
&#13;
        the assumption that Japan will vigorously pursue efforts to&#13;
&#13;
        reduce the present relatively high cost in her iron and steel&#13;
&#13;
        industry and her machinery industries.&#13;
&#13;
             These things, however, are not impossible of obtainment.&#13;
&#13;
        So that one can say that there is a prospect of progressively 
&#13;
&#13;
        reducing the present balance of payments deficit.       This does 
&#13;
&#13;
    I   not mean, that is, when one says there is a possibility, that 
&#13;
&#13;
II there will      be a d ef'1 cit , let t s say, of' several hundred million&#13;
&#13;
II 	 dollars.     It does not necessarily mean, first of all, that&#13;
&#13;
        this deficit will actually occur.     Of course, there is nothing&#13;
&#13;
        inevitable about amlance of payments deficit.        If a country&#13;
&#13;
        wants to and is determined to pull its belt a little tighter,&#13;
&#13;
        it may get rid of this deficit.     A lot will depend upon the&#13;
&#13;
        determination and the sense of discipline shown by the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                17 
&#13;
    Japanese people under conditions of possible adversity, and&#13;
we have of course some demonstration that in the past the&#13;
    Japanese people in emergencies of that sort are willing to&#13;
    show a certain amount of discipline and are willing to make&#13;
    sacrifices for the nation's good.   Nor does it necessarily&#13;
    mean that ultimately Japan will be able to square her interÂ­&#13;
    national debts, but all one can see is that at the moment,&#13;
    insofar as one can see ahead, one cannot hold out a definite&#13;
    assurance that Japan will be able to balance her accounts&#13;
    quite independent of these special dollar incomes.   Whether or&#13;
        it will ultimately be able to reach a closer balance in&#13;
    its international accounts depends on several factors,&#13;
    including the possibility of bringing about a more accelerated&#13;
      velopment of Southeast Asia, to make more raw materials and&#13;
Ifoodstuffs from these non-dollar areas available to the Japanes&#13;
!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    economy and to make it possible for Southeast Asia to absorb&#13;
    more in the way of Japanese manufactures, particularly capital&#13;
    equipment.   It depends, too, perhaps ultimately on the&#13;
    possibility of restoring trade with China, which of course&#13;
    depends upon the general relaxation of world tensions and also&#13;
    upon the extent of structural changes in the Chinese economy,&#13;
    concerning the exact nature of which we have very little&#13;
.information at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
I        A lot of the future development of Japan will depend upon&#13;
    Japan's own efforts, as Mr. Garner has already indicated.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               18 
&#13;
     There must be a vigorous effort to reduce costs in some&#13;
&#13;
of Japan l s high-cost industries, particularly coal, iron,&#13;
&#13;
steel, and machinery.     Above all, I think there must be a very&#13;
&#13;
determined effort to maintain financial equilibrium.&#13;
&#13;
        Japan in the immediate postwar period suffered from&#13;
&#13;
a spiraling inflation which was finally stopped in 1949 as&#13;
&#13;
the result of the issuance of a SCAP directive and the advice&#13;
&#13;
of Mr. Dodge, who was employed as financial adviser to SCAP.&#13;
&#13;
For some years thereafter the Government l s fiscal policy&#13;
&#13;
moved definitely in the direction of financial stability,&#13;
&#13;
although at the same time it continued inflation of bank&#13;
&#13;
credit to a considerable extent, which offset the effects of&#13;
&#13;
the Government1s fiscal policies.     However, more recently&#13;
&#13;
we have detected some signs of the relaxation of ttlS policy&#13;
&#13;
of financial equilibrium, which as Mr. Garner has indicated&#13;
&#13;
has created some anxiety on our part and which we have frankly&#13;
&#13;
discussed with the Japanese Government and which we have&#13;
&#13;
proposed to keep under constant review in the future with the&#13;
&#13;
Japanese authorities, both in their interest and in ours.&#13;
&#13;
        When you look at some of the mid-year economic indicators&#13;
&#13;
one sees the fact, for example, that cash and deposit&#13;
&#13;
currency is up quite markedly over a corresponding of last&#13;
&#13;
year.     The same is true of the loans and discounts of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank of Japan and loans and discounts of all other banks.&#13;
&#13;
These factors I think have undoubtedly been responsible for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                19 
&#13;
    the fact that throughout the first half of this year you had&#13;
&#13;
    a continuous increase in the volume of imports in Japan,&#13;
&#13;
    while at the same time the volume of exports by comparison&#13;
&#13;
    with the similar period of the previous year was falling,&#13;
&#13;
    thereby accentuating the disequilibrium in the balance of&#13;
&#13;
    payments.   So that during the first half of 1953 Japan&#13;
&#13;
    actually disbursed far more foreign exchange than she earned,&#13;
&#13;
    thus reversing the trend of the previous years.   I think there&#13;
&#13;
    is some sign now that exports are again reviving, but I think&#13;
&#13;
    the continued high rate of imports stems in part from the&#13;
&#13;
    renewal of these inflationary tendencies and does, I think,&#13;
&#13;
    give some cause for alarm about the future trends.&#13;
&#13;
         Of course, future development of the Japanese economy is&#13;
&#13;
    not wholly within Japanese control.   I have already alluded&#13;
&#13;
i   to the possible effect of reopening trade with China.&#13;
&#13;
    Obviously, that is not within Japanese control.   The Japanese&#13;
&#13;
    economy, like the economy of a great many countries, is&#13;
&#13;
    dependent to a considerable extent on the evolution of the&#13;
&#13;
    U. S. economy, not only insofar as the U. S. economy itself&#13;
&#13;
    will provide a larger growing market for Japanese goods but&#13;
&#13;
    also insofar as the U. S. economy, of course, has important&#13;
&#13;
    repercussions on the economic situation of the underdeveloped&#13;
&#13;
    countries in ASia, which in turn are an important market for&#13;
&#13;
    Japanese goods.   Therefore, the extent to which Southeast&#13;
&#13;
    Asia can develop its economy and its trade with Japan and the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             20 
&#13;
&#13;
rest of the world depends not only upon Japanese efforts&#13;
&#13;
and of course the Japanese can provide technical know-how to a&#13;
&#13;
certain extent, despite the fact that Japan is a capital&#13;
&#13;
. importing country, even certain capital investments perhaps&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ to stimulate economic development in this area.   But, by and&#13;
&#13;
large, the economic development of Southeast Asia, of course,&#13;
&#13;
must be the result of international collaboration, including&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ the activities of our own Bank in stimulating the economic&#13;
&#13;
development of that part of the world.&#13;
&#13;
      Mr. Garner has already alluded to the importance of the&#13;
&#13;
Japanese economy to the rest of the world.    I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 evident to all of us that the world as a whole has a&#13;
&#13;
tremendous stake in the economy and political stability of&#13;
&#13;
Japan and its eighty-six millionpeople, crowded together in&#13;
&#13;
 an area the size of California.   The potential explosive&#13;
&#13;
 possibilities of that situation, as a result of past&#13;
&#13;
 experience, are already familiar to us.&#13;
&#13;
      I think one might refer to the fact that Japan by far&#13;
&#13;
 is the largest manufacturing country in ASia, and that&#13;
&#13;
 therefore Asia in particular has an important stake in the&#13;
&#13;
 Japanese economy.   The Japanese economy, being a very&#13;
&#13;
 important non-dollar source of supply for capital equipment&#13;
&#13;
 and manufactures to the rest of ASia, the Japanese in turn&#13;
&#13;
 can supply the rest of Asia with a large volume of manufacture ,&#13;
&#13;
 including capital eqUipment, to stimulate industrial&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             21 
&#13;
&#13;
development in Southeast ASia, which actually lifts the&#13;
&#13;
standard of living of the rest of the area, to the mutual&#13;
&#13;
profit of both Japan and the rest of Asia.     So that I think the&#13;
&#13;
crucial importance of Japan to the rest of the world and&#13;
&#13;
particularly to Asia does make it desirable to try and approach.&#13;
&#13;
this whole Japanese problem in a constructive sense, and puts&#13;
&#13;
upon us presumably the obligation of trying to help Japan&#13;
&#13;
insofar as we can to achieve the much desired economic and&#13;
&#13;
political stability.&#13;
&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you.   Dr. Lee.&#13;
&#13;
     DR. LEE:    Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment Mr. de Wilde&#13;
&#13;
on his very elaborate and fair presentation of the economic&#13;
&#13;
situation of Japan.     It is not easy to make a concise stateÂ­&#13;
&#13;
ment of such admirable quality on such a complicated SUbject.&#13;
&#13;
But perhaps due to a slip of the tongue, Mr. de ,Â·alde&#13;
&#13;
mentioned China.     I think it should be Red China, and I just&#13;
&#13;
want to mention that to keep the record straight.&#13;
&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     That will be so recorded.&#13;
&#13;
     I now throw it open for any comments and questions.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. YUMOTO:     Mr. Chairman, I have listened to your&#13;
&#13;
opening remarks and also Mr. de Wildets explanation with great&#13;
&#13;
interest, and also when I read the report itself I found that&#13;
&#13;
the explanation in the report gives a true picture of my&#13;
&#13;
count~Â·t   s economic condition.&#13;
&#13;
     I should say at this moment that Japan is still in a sort&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             22 
&#13;
&#13;
of transition period, and although we are trying to create&#13;
&#13;
stability in the near future, an evaluation by the Bankts&#13;
&#13;
management of Japants economic condition will be very helpful&#13;
&#13;
to the nation.&#13;
&#13;
      I hope that the economic condition of my country will&#13;
&#13;
be thoroughly discussed by the members of the Board, and I&#13;
&#13;
hope the members will thoroughly understand the real situation&#13;
&#13;
and the difficulties of my country.     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
      MR. CRENA DE IONGH:    Mr. Chairman, I ivould like to join&#13;
&#13;
in the chorus of compliments on the report.     I think the repo rti&#13;
&#13;
is very clear, very elaborate, and certainly has attempted to&#13;
&#13;
give the facts as they are, as a report of this nature should&#13;
&#13;
do.   I am also very thankful for Mr. de Wilde's explanation.&#13;
&#13;
      Mr. Chairman, you said that in the operations of the&#13;
&#13;
International Bank some loans are safer than other loans.&#13;
&#13;
I think the International Bank should be careful not to put&#13;
&#13;
itself in a position where the only debtors it will accept&#13;
&#13;
will be those who don.t want any loans.     On the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
there is a limit to the other side, and I think it is clear to&#13;
&#13;
all of us around this table that the figures as shown in the&#13;
&#13;
report at present are certainly not very nice to look at.&#13;
&#13;
      I think in discussing the creditworthiness of Japan one&#13;
&#13;
should not have the hope that they can look at the past and&#13;
&#13;
see how the future may be.     We all have seen, of course, that&#13;
in the past the Japanese people have proved to be exceedingly&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             23 
&#13;
thrifty, hard working, and capable ofhandling problems.      I&#13;
&#13;
think in discounting the figures as we see them in the report&#13;
&#13;
we have to take into account what we always like to take into&#13;
&#13;
account    the willingness to pay and also the capability of&#13;
&#13;
coping with one's problems.     I think that is an element we all.&#13;
will be ready to take into account.&#13;
&#13;
     Mr. de Wilde has pointed out that even if one projects&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese economic and financial po     cy in the future, one&#13;
&#13;
still has to cope with quite a considerable deficit.     Therefor,&#13;
&#13;
I come to the second element in the financial situation of&#13;
&#13;
Japan that one has to take into account, which is the huge sum&#13;
&#13;
of money that the American Government in various ways has&#13;
&#13;
brought into the country.     I think that in studying the&#13;
&#13;
financial situation of Japan one also has to project some of&#13;
&#13;
that into the future, because it would be very hard to&#13;
&#13;
visualize a situation where the United states financing would&#13;
&#13;
pullout altogether.&#13;
&#13;
     These are the things, Mr. Chairman, that I would like to&#13;
&#13;
say, and I would like to ask one question.     I think among the&#13;
&#13;
business that still has to be settled is the question of the&#13;
&#13;
war damage, and I would like Mr. de Wilde to elaborate on&#13;
that point a little further.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. DE WILDE:    Well, you are aware of the fact that under&#13;
&#13;
the treaty of peace Japan is obliged to make reparations.&#13;
&#13;
However, the reparation 1s supposed to be in the form of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                24 
&#13;
&#13;
    services, including manufacturing services which would not&#13;
&#13;
    impose a significant burden on the Japanese balance of&#13;
&#13;
    payments.   Up to the present there has not been, in the&#13;
&#13;
    bilateral negotiations that have been carried out between&#13;
&#13;
    Japan and the various reparation claimants, any definitive&#13;
&#13;
    settlement with any country as to the amount and the kind of&#13;
&#13;
    the reparation.    Just when these agreements will be reached&#13;
&#13;
    and what sort of a burden, if any, they are likely to place&#13;
&#13;
    upon the Japanese economy I think is almost impossible to&#13;
&#13;
    forecast at this time.     My feeling is that, in view of the&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;
i   limitations placed upon the kind of reparation, it is     reasonabl~&#13;
I                                                                          1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    to assume that probably they will not, when and if they take 
&#13;
&#13;
    place, impose a very severe additional burden on the Japanese 
&#13;
&#13;
    economy.    That is a matter of judgment, of course.   I think 
&#13;
&#13;
    only time will tell. 
&#13;
&#13;
         MR. CRENA DE IONGH:    The figures one reads about&#13;
&#13;
: possi bili ties of payments to be made to the Philippines and&#13;
&#13;
    to Indonesia are huge, just enormous.     I would not quite agree&#13;
&#13;
    wi th you if you mean that reparations in kind vJOuld not be&#13;
&#13;
    such a burden.    I think even if one expresses the reparations&#13;
&#13;
    in money, still that money has to be made good in kind.      So&#13;
&#13;
    I personally donlt see very much difference between reparations&#13;
&#13;
    in kind and reparations in money.&#13;
         MR. DE WILDE:    I donlt think it is correct to say that&#13;
&#13;
. what is involved here is necessarily reparations in kind.           It&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          25 
&#13;
is a particular kind of reparation in kind, which according to&#13;
&#13;
the peace treaty should not be allowed to impose a significant&#13;
&#13;
burden on the balance of payments.   For example, Japan letts&#13;
&#13;
say might manufacture certain goods, but only under condition&#13;
&#13;
that the reparation claimants financed the necessary import&#13;
&#13;
of raw materials that wouldhave to go into this type of&#13;
&#13;
manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
     At present, of course, Japan does have a considerable&#13;
&#13;
amount of excess industrial capacity in a number of lines&#13;
&#13;
which could be put to work manufacturing goods for the&#13;
&#13;
reparations claimants, assuming some way could be found to&#13;
&#13;
meet this direct or indirect burden on the balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
that is involved, and which presumably should not be at the&#13;
&#13;
expense of Japan.&#13;
&#13;
     It is a kind of reparations settlement that is awfully&#13;
&#13;
difficult to achieve.   On the one hand, of course, you have the&#13;
&#13;
fairly astronomical claims of some of the countries which&#13;
&#13;
have suffered severely during the war, and on the other hand&#13;
&#13;
you have the fairly restrictive conditions of the reparation&#13;
&#13;
sdttlement which are laid down in the peace treaty, and which&#13;
&#13;
may in fact prevent a very large volume of reparations.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. CRENA DE IONGH:    It still would mean an internal&#13;
&#13;
financial problem.&#13;
     MR. DE WILDE:   Yes.   I am not saying there would be no&#13;
&#13;
problems involved.&#13;
     MR. CRENA DE IONGH:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 26 
&#13;
         MR. YUMOTO:     May I add this point.   The amount of&#13;
&#13;
    reparations which is asked for by some of the countries is&#13;
&#13;
    enormous.    Of course, if this amount is to be paid in services&#13;
&#13;
    as provided in the peace treaty, it depends on the period&#13;
&#13;
    during which this payment should be made.      It seems to us it&#13;
&#13;
    is a very big amount, so that it is rather difficult to accept&#13;
&#13;
    the amount as it is.     And of course we have to see the&#13;
&#13;
    repercussion of such a big reparation on our own economic&#13;
&#13;
    condition.    That is the reason why we could not come to any&#13;
&#13;
    definite conclUSion with these countries, although we are&#13;
&#13;
    carrying on negotiations from time to time.      This question is&#13;
&#13;
    one of the obstacles, it seems to us, which is destroying the&#13;
&#13;
    ordinary commercial economic relations with these countries,&#13;
&#13;
    but such are the circumstances.     We have not come to a conÂ­&#13;
&#13;
    clusion, but we are trying to come to a conclusion which may&#13;
&#13;
    be quite satisfactory to both parties, considering that it&#13;
&#13;
    would not put any hard burden on our economy or any unnatural&#13;
&#13;
    burden on our balance of payments.     That is the difficulty.&#13;
&#13;
         THE CHAIRMAN:     I think we have to say that that is one of&#13;
&#13;
    the present unanswerable questions, but I believe history shows&#13;
&#13;
    that astronomical reparations have never been paid.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:     Mr. Chairman, it is a very important&#13;
i&#13;
'question, and I would like to ask if you or anybody else has&#13;
&#13;
    any idea as to when a solution to these questions can be&#13;
&#13;
    reached.     If it is not possible to indicate any time limit&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   27 
&#13;
      today, which is perhaps not possible, then I would like at&#13;
&#13;
      any rate to raise the question whether it is wise for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
      to embark on what I would call large-scale lending.     I am not&#13;
&#13;
      mentioning the $40 million, but that is a start, and I underÂ­&#13;
&#13;
      stand we may come to higher figures.     I raise the question&#13;
&#13;
      whether it is really reasonable for the Bank to embark on&#13;
&#13;
      large-scale lending if a question of this importance and&#13;
&#13;
      magnitude has not been solved.     So I would just raise this&#13;
&#13;
II question.&#13;
Ii&#13;
                  I think it is important.    That is one of the&#13;
i;&#13;
Ii&#13;
II important elements in this very difficult question which to my&#13;
!I&#13;
 I&#13;
Ii    mind is perhaps the most difficult question, if I may say so,&#13;
&#13;
Ii the Bank has ever faced.&#13;
II         There is no question about small loans to Iceland, and 
&#13;
I!i&#13;
'     small loans to Panama and Guatemala or whatever country you 
&#13;
&#13;
      want to mention, but here we are faced with a world-wide 
&#13;
&#13;
      problem which will influence world opinion toward the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
      the Bank's policy.     Therefore, I think we will have to be&#13;
&#13;
      very, very cautious.     To say "noll would be the most cautious&#13;
&#13;
      way, but that wouldn't be the right answer.     To say "yes"&#13;
&#13;
      even to $40 million involves risks and also involves risks&#13;
&#13;
      for what is to come after the $40 million.&#13;
&#13;
            I have several other questions I would like to put to 
&#13;
&#13;
      you afterwards, but as regards this question I just want to 
&#13;
&#13;
       raise the question whether it would not be advisable to make 
&#13;
&#13;
      any large-scale lending to Japan dependent on a reasonable 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     28 
&#13;
        solution being found to these questions of war reparations 
&#13;
&#13;
        and other payments that are to be settled in regard to the 
&#13;
&#13;
i       United States.&#13;
&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:    I think to that I would only say this:        I&#13;
&#13;
        think both the amount and the pace of lending to Japan is&#13;
&#13;
        dependent on certain actions regarding certain things that&#13;
&#13;
        are within the capacity of the Japanese Government, that is,&#13;
&#13;
        their financial policy, their general development policies,&#13;
&#13;
        and so forth.     I think what they do on that must be taken into&#13;
&#13;
        account.     It also depends on policies that other countries&#13;
&#13;
        may follow in the settlements with other countries.     I agree&#13;
&#13;
    I   with you that we cannot predict when these settlements will 
&#13;
&#13;
        be made or their nature.     I think one simply has to make his 
&#13;
&#13;
        own guess.    There have been certain other settlements made; 
&#13;
&#13;
        for instance, the settlement with Germany and the U. S. for 
&#13;
&#13;
        occupation costs.    Whether that is anything that will be 
&#13;
&#13;
        applied in the case of Japan, I don't know; but I do feel that 
&#13;
&#13;
        all of those problems -- very difficult ones -- both those 
&#13;
&#13;
        internal in Japan and those external, have to be weighed at 
&#13;
&#13;
        each step, and that the pace and amount of our lending in 
&#13;
&#13;
        Japan will have to be judged to a considerable extent on 
&#13;
&#13;
        progress made towards sound solutions of those various problem 
â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WAIGHT:     Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a general&#13;
&#13;
        remark before bringing up specific points in connection with&#13;
&#13;
        the report.     The general remark I would like to make is&#13;
&amp;#12;. that we are very concerned about this report.     We are concerned&#13;
&#13;
. inasmuch as the figures show anything but a healthy state.&#13;
&#13;
     We hope it is going to get better.   From an economic point of&#13;
&#13;
     view, there does not seem to be a great deal of justification&#13;
&#13;
     for loans, in view of the fact that even after the improvements&#13;
&#13;
     looked for over the next few years there will still be a&#13;
&#13;
     deficit in the external account of something like $300 million.&#13;
&#13;
     Nevertheless, there are occasions such as you have So ably&#13;
&#13;
     said in your opening remarks, Mr. Chairman, when the Bank&#13;
&#13;
     takes a risk.   But there are degrees of risk to be taken.&#13;
&#13;
     What we are concerned about is that the risk should not be too&#13;
&#13;
: great so as to damage the reputation of the Bank.      We are&#13;
;!&#13;
I;&#13;
i: concerned that the Bank should not create a precedent which&#13;
I&#13;
I&#13;
I would harm its loan operations in the future.&#13;
I&#13;
I      I think you have given some very compelling and convincing&#13;
                                                                 l&#13;
&#13;
i: reasons for taking a wider view in regard to Japan than a            I&#13;
Ii&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I! "Ourely economic view, and I think we would agree with those&#13;
I: ...&#13;
Ii&#13;
II compelling and convincing reasons you have given.     All I wish&#13;
I,&#13;
ii&#13;
Ii to say is that on economic grounds this is a difficult&#13;
Ii&#13;
11&#13;
!    proposi tion to judge, and without some wider aspect we would&#13;
Ii&#13;
i find it difficult to go along with it.&#13;
!I&#13;
                                              But there are wider&#13;
n&#13;
I aspects.&#13;
Ii&#13;
&#13;
               They do exist and we have to recognize them.     I&#13;
&#13;
I think    when the time comes to consider the proposals we shall&#13;
&#13;
II be guided by those wider aspects.&#13;
I&#13;
          Now if I may come to some more points on the report.      I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              30&#13;
 would like to join my colleagues in commending Mr. de Wilde&#13;
&#13;
 on the very excellent report.      If I now criticize it in one&#13;
&#13;
 or two respects I hope you will not think I am diminishing&#13;
&#13;
: my praise in any way at all, but I am under instructions to&#13;
&#13;
 make one or two points.&#13;
&#13;
        The first point concerns paragraph 13, which you will&#13;
&#13;
 note relates to restrictive practices, and in particular on&#13;
&#13;
 page 26, about the middle of the page.      It states that Japan&#13;
&#13;
 has suffered severely from discriminatory trade restrictions,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly in the sterling area where they normally market&#13;
&#13;
 the bulk of cotton textile exports.&#13;
&#13;
        We consider that to be an unjustified attack on the 
&#13;
&#13;
 sterling area.     The Japanese figures themselves, as shown in 
&#13;
&#13;
, 3M   5366, show that Japanese exports have expanded more to the 
&#13;
 sterling area than to anywhere else since 1950.&#13;
&#13;
         It is also relevant to point out that the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
 exports to those countries not exercising "discrimination,"&#13;
&#13;
 such as Pakistan, have fallen much more heavily than her&#13;
&#13;
 exports to the colonies.&#13;
&#13;
         The other point I would like to mention is that there is&#13;
&#13;
 no mention in the summary of Japants position of her own very&#13;
&#13;
 high rate of interest and its bearing on her situation.&#13;
 Perhaps Mr. de Wilde will say something about that.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. DE WILDE:   With respect to the general question of&#13;
&#13;
 trade restrictions, I think you are right in saying that for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      31 
&#13;
        a while at least exports to the sterling area developed fairly&#13;
i&#13;
&#13;
i&#13;
i rapidly, and Japan for a considerable period of time had a&#13;
Ii      substantial favorable balance of payments with the sterling&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
II&#13;
II area.       This situation, however, rapidly reversed itself in the&#13;
&#13;
    I   second half of last year, and particularly during the first&#13;
&#13;
        half of the current year.   The result was that in the first&#13;
&#13;
        half of this year there was an actual excess of payments to&#13;
&#13;
        the sterling area by Japan of the equivalent of $212 million,&#13;
&#13;
        which is a not insignificant sum.     Payments received for&#13;
&#13;
        exports in the sterling area the first half of the year 1953&#13;
&#13;
        dropped to $150 million, as compared with $384 million in the&#13;
&#13;
        equivalent period of last year.     This in part I think is due&#13;
&#13;
        to the fact that there was a natural decline in the markets&#13;
&#13;
        of some parts of the sterling area because of the reduced&#13;
&#13;
        purchasing power of raw material producing countries within&#13;
&#13;
        the sterling area, brought about by certain balance of payment&#13;
&#13;
        restrictions.   For example, Pakistan, which is of course&#13;
&#13;
        within the sterling area, imposed fairly severe restrictions&#13;
&#13;
        on imports from Japan, and Pakistan is a very important market&#13;
&#13;
        to Japan.   There were also, however, fairly severe restriction,&#13;
&#13;
        as you know, against Japanese textile imports in the dependent&#13;
&#13;
        territories of the U. K., and I think in that connection it is&#13;
&#13;
        POssible to pOint out that although, letts say, the British&#13;
&#13;
        Government back in April 1953 agreed with the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
        Government to recommend the progressive relaxation of these&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      32 
&#13;
 restrictions against Japanese imports in these dependent&#13;
&#13;
, territories, it is only very recently.&#13;
&#13;
        There is no doubt that Japan suffers from high interest&#13;
&#13;
 rates.       It is a country   ~here   capital has been extremely&#13;
&#13;
 short in relation to the demand for capital.            This has&#13;
&#13;
 naturally produced a very high interest rate structure.               I&#13;
                                                                             i&#13;
                                                                             I&#13;
 don.t think frankly that one can do very much about a              situatio~&#13;
                                                                             I&#13;
 of this sort,      ~hich   of course does affect the cost structure&#13;
&#13;
 of Japanese industry and the ability of Japan to compete&#13;
&#13;
 in international markets, short of bringing about a better&#13;
&#13;
 balance      bet~een   savings and investment.     Savings generally&#13;
&#13;
 have fallen short of investment requirements.            There has been&#13;
&#13;
 a severe shortage of capital, and that inevitably has produced&#13;
&#13;
 a rather high interest rate structure.&#13;
&#13;
        The Japanese Government is trying to do something about&#13;
&#13;
 it insofar as various government institutions have provided&#13;
&#13;
 a considerable amount of capital to certain key industries&#13;
&#13;
 like iron, steel, coal, and shipbuilding.             They have recently&#13;
&#13;
 reduced, for example, the interest rate on shipbuilding&#13;
&#13;
 loans.       Of course, Japan has in the past three years exported&#13;
&#13;
 a considerable amount of ships, and a high rate of interest&#13;
&#13;
 on ship construction has to some extent handicapped Japan&#13;
&#13;
 in being competitive        ~ith   other shipbuilding countries.&#13;
&#13;
        THE CHAIRMAN:       I might say that   ~e   discussed this proble&#13;
&#13;
 from   t~o    angles, one angle emphasizing that due to the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  33&#13;
      shortage of capital we feel it is very important that Japan&#13;
&#13;
      through her public policies concentrate on investments in&#13;
&#13;
Ijessentials and minimize investments in non-essentials. That&#13;
'I&#13;
I'&#13;
II is one angle of it, and I think there is considerable room for&#13;
!I improvement there.&#13;
I,&#13;
I' 
&#13;
Ii      The other is -- and this we discussed with the Bank of 
&#13;
II&#13;
I'&#13;
&#13;
1,1   Japan -- the importance of credit policies which will, if&#13;
II&#13;
II possible, work towards a better supply of capital for those&#13;
      things that really are productive, and perhaps penalty rates&#13;
&#13;
      on some types of activity which are not so productive.&#13;
&#13;
           The high cost of money in Japan is a definite handicap&#13;
&#13;
      in their cost of production.    Our feeling is that approaches&#13;
&#13;
      have to be on that line rather than just trying artificially&#13;
&#13;
      to lower the cost of credit to everybody, and perhaps increase&#13;
&#13;
      the incentive to go into things that are not basically&#13;
&#13;
      producti ve.&#13;
&#13;
           We didntt intend in this paragraph referred to to be&#13;
&#13;
      condemning anybody.    We were simply trying to point out the&#13;
&#13;
      fact that certain things exist, and one might, if you were&#13;
&#13;
      talking to some other experts on Japan, have said "DiscriminaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
      tory practices of the United states tariff" or something of&#13;
&#13;
      that sort.     It wasntt intended as a criticism at all.   It is&#13;
      just a statement of fact.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WAIGHT:     I dontt mind that, but it isntt in accordanc&#13;
&#13;
      with the facts.     It is in accordance with the facts of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                34 
&#13;
&#13;
" last few months.    Since 1950 it is quite the opposite.&#13;
&#13;
      THE CHAIRMAN:     May I suggest that Mr. de Wilde sit down&#13;
&#13;
 with you and make any corrections that the facts prove.&#13;
&#13;
      Japan is also suffering from the fact that with certain&#13;
&#13;
 countries they haven't been able to work out new trade&#13;
&#13;
 relations, some of it because these reparations questions&#13;
&#13;
 have not been settled.     The settlement of the reparation&#13;
&#13;
 question is holding up some of the trade agreements, and in&#13;
&#13;
 certain places the Japanese shipping industry is discriminated&#13;
&#13;
 against.   All of those are facts which we think are part of&#13;
 this picture in trying to remove gradually those factors which&#13;
&#13;
 are handicapping the Japanese economy.&#13;
&#13;
      MR. ZAHN:      I join in complimenting the authors of the&#13;
&#13;
 report, and I want to compliment Mr. de Wilde for his oral&#13;
&#13;
 report, because he has given more weight in his oral report&#13;
&#13;
 to one point that seemed to me rather important, and that is&#13;
&#13;
 the viewpoint of the different starting point for Japan after&#13;
&#13;
 the war than for most other countries.      I have been led to&#13;
&#13;
 this argument by the development in my own country, because&#13;
&#13;
 the economic conditions after the last war, with all the&#13;
&#13;
 destruction, are much heavier than the statistics show, and&#13;
&#13;
 this leads me to a little more optimistic attitudes toward&#13;
&#13;
 the general development in Japan.      If you take it from a&#13;
&#13;
 dynamic angle, then the situation inspires more confidence&#13;
&#13;
 than the mere statistical comparison with prewar conditions,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            35&#13;
and I am very glad that Mr. de Wilde gave proper weight to&#13;
&#13;
this in his oral report, because it might be of some weight&#13;
&#13;
in the judgment of the present conditions in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
    The second point I should like to mention is the $800&#13;
&#13;
million United states expenditures in Japan.     There might be&#13;
&#13;
less United States dollar expenditures in Japan after the&#13;
&#13;
peace has been accomplished in Korea, but there will under&#13;
&#13;
present conditions always remain a rather considerable amount&#13;
&#13;
of United States defense expenditure in Japan.     Nobody can&#13;
&#13;
make any forecast, but I want to bring up one idea that has&#13;
&#13;
not been mentioned here.   We must look into the alternatives&#13;
&#13;
that we have.   The report analyzes one alternative, and that&#13;
&#13;
is less United states expenditures will be made in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
That means that present conditions do no longer exist.     What&#13;
&#13;
could be the possible changes except war?   The most likely is&#13;
&#13;
a readjustment of the political atmosphere in the Far East.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. de Wilde has hinted at that, too, and I simply should go&#13;
&#13;
a little more into that.&#13;
&#13;
     In case that Japan has a new adjustment in the political&#13;
&#13;
atmosphere, then there would be less defense expenditure of&#13;
&#13;
the United States, but on the other hand Japan would very&#13;
&#13;
likely have access to their markets, and not only on the&#13;
&#13;
export side but on the import side, too, and that would help&#13;
&#13;
in the dollar balance of trade on the import side and save&#13;
them dollars.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              36 
&#13;
     The same applies, by the way, to my own country, and&#13;
&#13;
therefore I have gone into this rather extensively.     We&#13;
&#13;
should not only say that forecasts are very uncertain.&#13;
&#13;
Certainly they are.   But there is a certain link between the&#13;
&#13;
decrease of defense expenditures and the change in the trade&#13;
&#13;
situation of Japan, not only on the export side but on the&#13;
&#13;
import side as well -- coal, iron ore, foodstuffs -- which&#13;
&#13;
would save a lot of dollars and from that angle also reduce&#13;
&#13;
the $300 million estimate that has been made for 1957.&#13;
&#13;
     If you will permit me to go into one more question of a&#13;
&#13;
general nature, but not concerning Japan so much as it&#13;
&#13;
concerns the report as such.   It is connected with the questio&#13;
&#13;
concerning interest rates and bank policy in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
     The situation of the banks in a country that has lost a&#13;
&#13;
war is rather difficult.   We have had the same experience.&#13;
&#13;
In this connection, I simply should look at the report a bit&#13;
&#13;
closer.   On page 32 the report says:   "The government was a&#13;
&#13;
relati vely insignificant supplier of industrial â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢   .!1   And&#13;
&#13;
then on page 5 of the introduction the report says that Japan&#13;
&#13;
must have high taxes to provide the government adequate funds&#13;
&#13;
not only for public investment but for investment in essential&#13;
&#13;
private industries.   On page 83 the same thing comes up again,&#13;
&#13;
saying that so long as voluntary and individual corporate&#13;
&#13;
savings are likely to be inadequate, it seems essential to&#13;
&#13;
keep government revenues at a level to channel a considerable&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     37 
&#13;
portion of its income to this end into key industries.&#13;
&#13;
     For superficial readers, this might seem to suggest that&#13;
&#13;
the report means to let the population pay high taxes In order&#13;
&#13;
to give the government enough money to go into private&#13;
&#13;
:i.ndustries.     This might be one solution.       But I think we&#13;
&#13;
should open discussion also on the other possibilities of&#13;
&#13;
having lower taxes in order to give the necessary money to&#13;
&#13;
private individuals, to the private business wcrld, to&#13;
&#13;
develop their own means to put them into private industries.&#13;
&#13;
What you say is right, but I think this is only one choice.&#13;
&#13;
I think it would be wise to open our view also to the second&#13;
&#13;
solution.       That means readjustment of the domestic capital&#13;
&#13;
market in order to prevent the government going too much into&#13;
&#13;
private industries, and leave open enough room for lower&#13;
&#13;
taxes that gives the business community enough money to do&#13;
&#13;
this themselves.&#13;
&#13;
      MR. DE WILDE:      I would say, Dr.   ~ahn,    that these&#13;
&#13;
approaches are not necessarily inconsistent or irreconcilable,&#13;
&#13;
but I suggested that it would probably be appropriate to mainÂ­&#13;
&#13;
tain a fairly high level of taxes as a source of investment&#13;
&#13;
funds, not simply for industry.       For example, the government&#13;
&#13;
provides certain capital to, let's say, the Japan Development&#13;
&#13;
Bank, which in turn assists in financing some of the basiC&#13;
&#13;
industries.       It doesnlt take over the industries.       The&#13;
&#13;
industries are private industries, but they are being financed&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           38 
&#13;
in part by a government financial institution or other&#13;
&#13;
long-term credit institutions which enjoy some government&#13;
&#13;
financial support, such as a long-term credit bank, but the&#13;
&#13;
budget is also a source of other investment funds for&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, for transport, and to that extent is more&#13;
&#13;
significant than for industry.&#13;
&#13;
     In this report it is pointed out that certainly it would&#13;
&#13;
be desirable to reduce some of the direct taxes that are a&#13;
&#13;
burden on industry and are somewhat of a deterrent to&#13;
&#13;
business savings and self-financing by industry.     I think the&#13;
&#13;
reduction of some of these direct taxes is not necessarily&#13;
&#13;
irreconcilable with the idea of maintaining tax revenues&#13;
&#13;
in the over-all sense at a pretty high level so that the&#13;
&#13;
government can furnish or can be instrumental in channeling&#13;
&#13;
necessary investment funds in agriculture, transport, and&#13;
&#13;
to a certain extent industry, through government controlled&#13;
&#13;
or government assisted financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
     THE   CHAIR~MN:   I might say I have great sympathy for&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Zahnfs approach, and specifically we did discuss that.&#13;
&#13;
I think in almost our first discussion with the Japanese we&#13;
&#13;
talked about power.     I had the benefit of very little&#13;
&#13;
knowledge, but the knowledge was sufficiently accurate to see&#13;
&#13;
that power rates in Japan have lagged tremendously behind&#13;
&#13;
the level of cost.     When they told me that power was their&#13;
&#13;
most important priority, I said, "Well, it seems to me one of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             39 
&#13;
the first things you ought to do is enable the power companies&#13;
&#13;
ito have sufficient earnings so that they can have a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
amount of capital for reinvestrnent. 1I   That got a good deal of&#13;
&#13;
attention.   I said, "I think that applies to business in&#13;
&#13;
general," because I think it is true that in the stages of&#13;
&#13;
recovery of an economy from war and inflation self-investment&#13;
&#13;
by industry is the first form in which capital begins to flow.&#13;
&#13;
More, it provides the possibility of getting individual&#13;
&#13;
investors to invest their money.     And so I applied that in&#13;
&#13;
segments; that I thought in general the Japanese tax system&#13;
&#13;
should be examined from the standpoint of relieving somewhat&#13;
&#13;
the burden on industry and making an incentive for them to&#13;
&#13;
have profits and to reinvest it.     All the businessmen cheered&#13;
&#13;
at that, but I said it also seems to us that the over-all&#13;
&#13;
level of taxation in Japan and the revenues necessary for the&#13;
&#13;
government to carry out their purposes, aside from industrial&#13;
&#13;
purposes, are very high, and that grave questions could be&#13;
&#13;
raised as to whether Japan can afford to drop the level of&#13;
&#13;
the revenues.&#13;
&#13;
     We talked along the line that you are mentioning, and I&#13;
&#13;
am much in accord with your idea that to the maximum extent&#13;
&#13;
industry and private capital should be encouraged and enabled&#13;
&#13;
to make its own investments, and then gradually try to lead&#13;
&#13;
to the development of a private capital market rather than to&#13;
&#13;
say that the government takes the revenues and puts those&#13;
revenues into private industry. I think it is more economic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                40 
&#13;
and sounder in the long run.     So I hope if there is confusion&#13;
&#13;
on that, at least that will be given due weight.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:     Mr. Chairman, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
revert to the question raised by our colleague from the U. K.,&#13;
&#13;
when he speaks about Japan having suffered severely from&#13;
&#13;
discriminatory restrictions.     I am not going to say anything&#13;
&#13;
about whether the words are well chosen or not, but I think&#13;
&#13;
on the other hand we should be fully aware of the difficulties&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese, I am sure, will meet in different areas when&#13;
&#13;
they try to get into the market, which they will have to.&#13;
&#13;
     I may be wrongly informed on this.     I have   my   knowledge&#13;
&#13;
from the newspapers.     They are not always right, but I&#13;
&#13;
recollect having read during the last few weeks some articles&#13;
&#13;
on what is going on in another international circle.         I am&#13;
&#13;
referring to the meeting of GATT -- General Agreement on&#13;
&#13;
Tariffs and Trade.     I am not trying to say whether this is so&#13;
&#13;
or not, but I understand there are some difficulties as to the&#13;
&#13;
access of Japan to that agreement.     I am not saying it is&#13;
&#13;
wrong, but it shows clearly the difficulties which we will&#13;
&#13;
have to take into consideration.&#13;
&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     I think that is very true.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:    May I add my apologies for not&#13;
&#13;
having paid tribute to the report as it is, but I want to say&#13;
&#13;
my first impression      I have been through this report three&#13;
&#13;
times -- was that it has really confirmed the views you&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            41&#13;
expressed, Mr. Chairman, eight months ago, and the report as&#13;
&#13;
it is gives us all the necessary material for understanding&#13;
&#13;
the way in which you presented the question eight months ago,&#13;
&#13;
which I admired very much.&#13;
&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you for all the compliments.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. YUMOTO:     First of all, I will give some explanation&#13;
&#13;
in connection with Mr. Zahnts view.     While the total amount of&#13;
&#13;
the government investment is not so big -- I think, as it is&#13;
&#13;
stated in the paper, it is about 10 percent -- it has a&#13;
&#13;
very effective meaning and very important meaning, in two&#13;
&#13;
ways, I should say.&#13;
     There are two kinds of government investment.     One if&#13;
&#13;
the investment through the Development Bank of Japan, which is&#13;
&#13;
a sort of government agency.     The other is the investment by&#13;
&#13;
the government of such funds as the postal savings and&#13;
&#13;
things like that.     This Development Bank is giving the loans&#13;
&#13;
to what they call major industries       power, coal mining,&#13;
&#13;
shipbuilding, and steel and iron.     In giving this loan, it is&#13;
&#13;
the usual practice of the Development Bank that the borrower&#13;
&#13;
should get money not only from the Development Bank but also&#13;
&#13;
get the money from private sources.     They will serve as sort&#13;
&#13;
of advisers to the investors, and I believe this will be a&#13;
&#13;
sort of cooperative investment.&#13;
     Another merit of this loan by the Development Bank may&#13;
&#13;
be the interest rate.     The funds given by the Development&#13;
Bank has no cost at all, because this is the counterpart&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 42 
&#13;
,&#13;
i   fund, but the Development Bank cannot give thi s fund in forms&#13;
&#13;
    of loans at cheap interest rates because it will disturb the&#13;
&#13;
    general situation of interest.     But they are trying to lower&#13;
&#13;
    the rate as much as possible so that they can lead the money&#13;
&#13;
    into the market at a lower rate.&#13;
&#13;
         So I should say that the government investment has the&#13;
&#13;
    merit of providing the private investors to the important&#13;
&#13;
    industries and also trying to reduce the market interest&#13;
&#13;
    gradually.&#13;
&#13;
         As to the point which was mentioned by the U. K.&#13;
&#13;
    Director and lvlr. Sveinbjornsson about the discriminatory&#13;
&#13;
    restrictions, this was discussed in the Fund Board meeting the&#13;
&#13;
    other day, and it was the complaint of our side so far as the&#13;
&#13;
    sterling area is concerned that we couldn't get any effect&#13;
&#13;
    of the import on Japanese goods which was promised by the&#13;
    U. K. Government sometime early this year, and we urged the&#13;
&#13;
    reduction as soon as possible so that we can export to the&#13;
&#13;
    sterling area.   We are still keeping the import level from the&#13;
&#13;
    sterling area, expecting that the exports to the sterling&#13;
&#13;
    area in the future will make the balance of payments situation&#13;
&#13;
    with the sterling area more favorable.      But I understand that&#13;
&#13;
    many members of the sterling area have already relaxed the&#13;
&#13;
    restrictions, and I am   expe~ting   that the effect will soon be&#13;
    reflected in the actual figures.&#13;
         MR. HOPPENOT:   On the question raised about prospects of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             43 
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         On this second point I think we should all keep in mind&#13;
 ~~\(!&#13;
that more and more countries proficient in the production of&#13;
&#13;
industrial and capital goods';\6ould only take as an example&#13;
                            I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese project, where a score of countries have declared&#13;
&#13;
they are quite able to build and to provide the kind of&#13;
                                   ! ! .&#13;
                                   f-4v'/'&#13;
equipment that was needed in â&#128;¢ given case.            So I am not too&#13;
&#13;
sure that any given country expanding its possibilities will&#13;
                         0-')                   '4~&#13;
be as able, let's say,vthirty years ~ to sell the&#13;
&#13;
production in other countries; which brings me back to the&#13;
&#13;
question of investment in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
         Every country is now taking stock and saying,              l~ell,&#13;
&#13;
have we got enough capacity?           Do we need more capacity?             Maybe&#13;
&#13;
we have too nruch capacity. II       I could very easily mention at&#13;
&#13;
least one field where the world capacity is something like&#13;
&#13;
between one and one-half or two times what the world requires;&#13;
&#13;
~in          the case of a rather poor country, which is Japan,&#13;
     ~};I&#13;
~        â&#128;¢ very large population     ~       has to eat and to earn&#13;
               tr'                                      n &lt;Jl/..~&#13;
money to eat, more than to buy some more textileVmachinery,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               44&#13;
       It is   ~a      problem when we look at the case for coal&#13;
&#13;
mines, which has been described in this paper.       The showing&#13;
&#13;
of the output of coal mines has been very poor since 146 or&#13;
&#13;
148.     Manpower plays a very important part in the production&#13;
&#13;
of coal, and I am wondering if in that given case and other&#13;
&#13;
cases the answer is always investment or machinery.       I think&#13;
&#13;
it is a very broad question, a question that not by any&#13;
&#13;
means is particular to Japan.&#13;
&#13;
       Do you feel that today investment is the only or even&#13;
&#13;
the major answer to the problem of feeding 86 million people?&#13;
&#13;
       MR. DE WILDE:     I think your question is directed to two&#13;
&#13;
points, as I understand it.       First of all you raise the&#13;
&#13;
question of whether there might not be some contradiction&#13;
&#13;
between our earlier statement on the one hand referring to&#13;
&#13;
export capital.&#13;
&#13;
       I think in view of the general shortage of capital in&#13;
&#13;
Japan there is no doubt a need for net imports of capital into&#13;
&#13;
Japan.     At the same time, there are cases conceivable in&#13;
&#13;
which it might be more appropriate for Japan to make certain&#13;
&#13;
investments outside of the country in its own interest, rather&#13;
&#13;
than to make an equi valent inve stment iÂ·n Japan itself.      I am&#13;
&#13;
referring, for example, to where it is possible to stimulate&#13;
&#13;
the development of some new sources of supply of raw materials&#13;
&#13;
and foodstuffs elsewhere in Asia by some modest investment of&#13;
&#13;
Japanese capital.       There have already been a few cases in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 45 
&#13;
      point where Japan has put a modest amount of money in the&#13;
&#13;
      exploitation of iron ore resources elsewhere in ASia, for&#13;
&#13;
ii    example in India and the Philippines.     Japan has also found&#13;
&#13;
      it helps to facilitate the marketing of its capital equipment&#13;
&#13;
::in Asia by extending some medium-term credits to various&#13;
I,&#13;
&#13;
Iil&#13;
i&#13;
  icountries. Recently, for example , it made an arrangement of&#13;
I&#13;
Iithis sort with Pakistan.&#13;
     .      As far as the second part of your question whether&#13;
&#13;
 I!investment is really the answer in Japan, well, it is not 'then&#13;
 II&#13;
 Ilanswer; but certainly I think it is fair to say that there&#13;
&#13;
 I~st        still be a fairly high rate of investment, at least in&#13;
&#13;
 :Iessential industries, in Japan.        As I have indicated, there&#13;
&#13;
      are certain industries which at the moment suffer from a rather&#13;
&#13;
         igh cost of production.   It is possible through a program of&#13;
&#13;
         ationalization which will diminish the degree of obsolescence&#13;
&#13;
         f equipment, from which a number of Japanese industries still&#13;
&#13;
         uffer, that you can reduce cost of production.   I think that i&#13;
&#13;
         ertainly true in the iron and steel industry, where a program&#13;
&#13;
         f rationalization, for example, is now being carried out and&#13;
&#13;
         ill probably continue to be carried out over the next three&#13;
&#13;
         r four years.   It is also true in the coal industry, although,&#13;
&#13;
           course, the extent to which it is possible I think will&#13;
&#13;
         epend on a fairly detailed technical survey of the industry,&#13;
&#13;
         hich certainly I was not competent to make when I was in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
          t certainly from the facts which were placed at the mission l s&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               46 
&#13;
&#13;
, disposal it seemed a reasonable case that, for example, some&#13;
&#13;
 investment, particularly let.s say in vertical shafts in a&#13;
&#13;
 coal mining industry, could significantly enhance the&#13;
&#13;
 productivity per worker over present levels, and that the&#13;
&#13;
over-all output would be increased.&#13;
&#13;
      MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:   May I, Mr. Chairman, in connection&#13;
&#13;
with this question make a few remarks.      Mr. Hoppenot raised&#13;
 the question whether or not the right answer in the present&#13;
&#13;
 situation in Japan would be investment and more investment&#13;
&#13;
 and even still more investment.     This makes me feel that&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps also there is another possible answer to that question&#13;
&#13;
 in the long run.&#13;
&#13;
     We have heard several times about the 85 million people&#13;
&#13;
living in an area not larger than California, and we are told&#13;
&#13;
that the population of Japan is increasing at about one and&#13;
&#13;
one-half million every year.&#13;
&#13;
      Now, I know that in Japan there are some people very&#13;
&#13;
much interested in this     problem, and they have suggested&#13;
&#13;
 that one should perhaps adopt the policy which is adopted in&#13;
&#13;
 some other countries of so-called planned parenthood.     I know&#13;
&#13;
 this is a very se.rious problem.    It is so serious that I&#13;
&#13;
wouldn.t hesitate to say that the population problem in my&#13;
&#13;
 mind is perhaps the most important economic problem in the&#13;
&#13;
 world today in certain countries.&#13;
&#13;
     When we met some days ago -- I think it was last Friday Â­&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             47 
&#13;
Mr. Black made some remarks about the same problem, but perhaps&#13;
from a little different angle.   I hope you won't misunderstand&#13;
&#13;
me when I say that I had the feeling that Italy had some&#13;
&#13;
shoemakers to export.&#13;
&#13;
     This problem is referred to nearly every time we get a&#13;
&#13;
report on a country, and just yesterday we got a report on&#13;
&#13;
the proposed Italian loan, which will be discussed on the 6th.&#13;
&#13;
But I may with your permission, Mr. Chairman, just read the&#13;
&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
     liThe most serious structural problem of the Itald.an&#13;
&#13;
economy stems from her relatively overpopulation.    During the&#13;
&#13;
past fifteen years the population has been increasing at an&#13;
&#13;
annual rate of 5 to 8 percent, rising to a total of over&#13;
&#13;
47 million.   The recent decline in the birth rate has been&#13;
&#13;
offset by a similar decline in the death rate, and the&#13;
&#13;
present outlook is for an annual increase of roughly 400,000.&#13;
&#13;
Since emigration is not likely to remove more than 150,000&#13;
&#13;
annually, the net increase in population may be estimated&#13;
&#13;
at 250,000.   The labor force is expected to be augmented by&#13;
&#13;
about 130,000 annually, which a consequent further aggravation&#13;
&#13;
of the already serious unemployment problem. 1I&#13;
&#13;
     I don't need to quote any more.   As I say, to my mind&#13;
&#13;
this problem is the most important economic force.    There are&#13;
&#13;
also other aspects, but from an economic point of view I&#13;
&#13;
think this problem is really the most important, and that the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                48 
&#13;
Bank or the organization which is to raise if possible the&#13;
&#13;
standard of living of the borrower countries should not and&#13;
&#13;
could not, to my mind, keep out of it.&#13;
&#13;
       I donlt know how strongly my colleagues feel about this,&#13;
&#13;
but at any rate personally I would like to ask either the&#13;
&#13;
Bank or perhaps our colleague from Japan if it was possible&#13;
&#13;
to have a report on what is going on in that country in this&#13;
&#13;
particular field.      I think it is important.   We might discuss&#13;
&#13;
such a report later on and discuss what that would lead to.&#13;
&#13;
I just want to raise this question.       It has been indicated by&#13;
&#13;
so many others.      It is indicated in really every report we&#13;
&#13;
get.    Therefore, I think it is o.k. that I should ask for&#13;
&#13;
information about this question, and the particular question&#13;
&#13;
of Japan, which we are now discussing, and in which case I&#13;
&#13;
feel that we will have to discuss the problem of lending to&#13;
&#13;
that country at a future time.&#13;
&#13;
       MR. YUMOTO:     Mr. Sveinbjornsson has pointed out a very&#13;
&#13;
important problem of my country.      We are quite cognizant of&#13;
&#13;
this serious problem, and I am glad that I am able to give&#13;
&#13;
you full information on this problem.       If you wish me to&#13;
&#13;
put it in a paper, I will do so, or do you want some&#13;
&#13;
explanation now?&#13;
&#13;
       MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:     I think it is such an important&#13;
&#13;
problem that it is better to have it in writing.&#13;
&#13;
       THE CHAIRMAN:     I think a paper you might present on that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   49 
&#13;
would be very useful.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. YUMOTO:     Then I will do that.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. MACHADO:     Mr. Chairman, since the economic future of&#13;
                                                                          I&#13;
&#13;
Japan depends so largely on her ability to sell her production,!&#13;
&#13;
that is, to trade, I would like to get a little more information&#13;
&#13;
on a subject that was mentioned by our distinguished colleague,&#13;
&#13;
and that is the possibility of the prospects of Japan being&#13;
&#13;
admitted into the GATT, which would be one way of doing away&#13;
&#13;
with discriminatory practices against Japan and opening up new&#13;
&#13;
markets for her.&#13;
&#13;
        THE CHAIRMAN:     Do we know anything?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. DE WILDE:     I think you, Mr. Machado, perhaps know&#13;
&#13;
as much about this situation as we do at this juncture.&#13;
&#13;
~~.   Sveinbjornsson has already referred to the discussions&#13;
&#13;
which are going on concerning this topic currently in Geneva.&#13;
&#13;
There are, I believe, a certain number of countries who&#13;
&#13;
believe that the time has not yet come to admit Japan into&#13;
&#13;
GATT.     The United    States~   I think, has been a very strong&#13;
&#13;
proponent, and I believe your country too, Mr. Sveinbjornsson,Â­&#13;
&#13;
,       MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:       I think so, but I am not sure.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. DE WILDE:     -- of admitting Japan to GATT.    And there&#13;
&#13;
has been a certain number of countries, I believe, including&#13;
&#13;
yours, Mr. Waight, who feel the time is as yet inappropriate&#13;
&#13;
to admit Japan into GATT.         How this question is going to be&#13;
&#13;
resolved, I am afraid I don't know.          Maybe Mr. Waight knows.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 50 
&#13;
     MR. 1.fAIGHT:     I donI t have that crystal ball.&#13;
&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:       If you refer it back to the governments&#13;
&#13;
represented here and get a consensus, you might have the&#13;
&#13;
answer.&#13;
&#13;
     It is a very important thing.       It is a part of this whole&#13;
business, and I emphasize again that I don1t think we have&#13;
&#13;
seen any picture where solutions do not involve both the&#13;
&#13;
greatest effort on the part of the      count~J   itself, together&#13;
&#13;
with cooperation from other countries.       Japan canlt solve her&#13;
&#13;
problems alone.       The solutions are difficult, but she has to&#13;
&#13;
import and export to live, because I think one might well say&#13;
&#13;
that if Japan had the fiscal        tuation of some other countries&#13;
&#13;
we would say, as we have said in many others, "Concentrate&#13;
&#13;
on increasing your agricultural production to feed yourself. 11&#13;
&#13;
But I think as far as any known methods of food production&#13;
&#13;
are concerned that it does not seem within the capacity of&#13;
&#13;
Japan, with her land as it is, to feed herself.           On the other&#13;
&#13;
hand, we found considerable acti vi ty in the field of increasin'&#13;
&#13;
agricultural production.       The judgment that we have gotten is&#13;
&#13;
that it is not within the bounds of present techniques for&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese islands to produce enough food for their people,&#13;
&#13;
and that therefore one lipe of solution must be the developÂ­&#13;
&#13;
ment of industry and the raising of the level of her foreign&#13;
&#13;
trade.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. YUlv'IOTO:    About this GATT question, I am not an eX!E't&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                51 
&#13;
and haven't followed the development, but generally speaking,&#13;
&#13;
although we are not a member of the GATT, we are receiving a&#13;
&#13;
sort of de facto treatment; that is, as if Japan were a&#13;
&#13;
member of the GATT.      But there are some other countries who&#13;
&#13;
have not given even a de facto treatment. 
&#13;
&#13;
     As to the oppositlon question, there are variou s I'easons 
&#13;
&#13;
according to every country, but we hope that Japan will be&#13;
&#13;
put on the same footing with regard to the international trade.&#13;
&#13;
I hope the question will be solved as soon as possible, and&#13;
&#13;
we shall be in a position to have trade with other countries&#13;
&#13;
on an equal basj.s.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. OVERBY:      Mr. Chairman, if I may engage for a moment&#13;
&#13;
in an elaboration of the obvious, if this case were not&#13;
&#13;
fraught with great uncertainties we wouldntt be here today.&#13;
&#13;
There are a great many uncertainties, many of which have been&#13;
&#13;
alluded to orally here, and I think practically all of which&#13;
are covered in this report.     We certainly have the population&#13;
&#13;
problem.     We have the future trade relations problem.   We&#13;
&#13;
have GATT, and we have a multitude of problems in the&#13;
&#13;
situation.     It would be very convenient if anything I could&#13;
&#13;
say would in any way dispel the uncertnnties in this case,&#13;
&#13;
but I think you perhaps understand that there isn1t anything&#13;
&#13;
I can say that will dispel the uncertainties in this case.&#13;
&#13;
     The United states obviously has very friendly relations&#13;
&#13;
with Japan.    We expect to have such relations for a long time&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             52 
&#13;
in the future.   I would have to immediately qualify that&#13;
&#13;
remark by saying that that does not dispel the uncertainties&#13;
&#13;
as to the level of dollar disbursements in Japan which is&#13;
&#13;
referred to in this report.&#13;
&#13;
     The report quite correctly says that over a long period&#13;
&#13;
the volume of these types of U. S. special dollar procurement&#13;
&#13;
may be expected to drop off substantially.   I donlt think it&#13;
&#13;
is possible for me or anyone around this table to remove&#13;
&#13;
the uncertainties from this case.   I think, however, that&#13;
&#13;
we know that the immediate period is one in which there will&#13;
&#13;
be these dollar disbursements.   The current year will be&#13;
&#13;
substantial, from all the estimates I have seen.&#13;
&#13;
     I would only say that the combination of the uncertaintie&#13;
that we are all familiar with as to the future and the very&#13;
&#13;
immediate situation that will probably exist underlines the&#13;
&#13;
great urgency of Japan to get on with the very difficult&#13;
&#13;
problems that need to be faced, and I am sure from what I know&#13;
&#13;
and hear and from elsewhere that there is a realization of&#13;
&#13;
that on the part of the Japanese authorities.   The strong and&#13;
&#13;
weak points have been adequately elaborated in this report and&#13;
&#13;
in the discussion.   I donlt think I need to repeat them or to&#13;
&#13;
go over them.&#13;
&#13;
     The strong points certainly include the energy and&#13;
&#13;
industry of the people and their excellent debt record.&#13;
&#13;
These are among the strong factors which should be given due&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               53 
&#13;
weight.     On the weaker points, I think they too have been&#13;
&#13;
mentioned.     There is not only the need for trade relations&#13;
&#13;
improvement, but quite obviously a great deal needs to be&#13;
&#13;
done on the inflationary side, on the side of credit&#13;
&#13;
measures and tax measures.     The question of selectivity of&#13;
&#13;
investment, which has been touched upon, is certainly&#13;
&#13;
important.&#13;
&#13;
        There have been, I believe, some considerable tax&#13;
&#13;
reductions in Japan recently.     I think tax reductions which&#13;
&#13;
tend to stimulate savings and investments which lead to&#13;
&#13;
cost reductions are thoroughly justified.     It may be a quesÂ­&#13;
&#13;
tion~    however, whether tax reductions which stimulate domestic&#13;
&#13;
consumption under present conditions in Japan would be the&#13;
&#13;
most useful in view of the very difficult situation.&#13;
&#13;
        The credit inflation, if I may call it that, which&#13;
&#13;
apparently has been taking place recently, is obviously someÂ­&#13;
&#13;
thing which our Japanese friends are familiar with, and I&#13;
&#13;
think it is a matter to which they should and will devote&#13;
&#13;
their attention.&#13;
&#13;
        I am reassured in part by expressions on the part of&#13;
&#13;
responsible Japanese officials that there will be more&#13;
&#13;
vigorous action taken in the fields that have been touched&#13;
&#13;
upon in the report as needing attention, be it in the field&#13;
&#13;
of taxation or investment or credit policy, reserve requireÂ­&#13;
&#13;
ments of banks, and also in measures to improve the climate&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  54 
&#13;
for private investment.        I think all of these measures are in      I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the minds of responsible officials who have to deal with this,&#13;
&#13;
and we can only hope and urge that in considering the&#13;
&#13;
difficulties the problem be tackled very rapidly and very&#13;
&#13;
energetically.&#13;
&#13;
        Mr. Chairman, I didn't intend to say very much, and I&#13;
&#13;
think I have said as much as I should say.       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
        THE   CHAIRr~N:   If there are no more questions or&#13;
&#13;
compliments, I would like to say that inevitably I am carried&#13;
&#13;
back to about six years ago, when one or two members of this&#13;
&#13;
Board were then present, and recall the first loans that this&#13;
&#13;
Bank considered -- the reconstruction loans in Europe.        I also&#13;
&#13;
recall the difficult problems that we faced in Europe at that&#13;
&#13;
time.    We didn't know about the Marshall Plan, and we made our&#13;
&#13;
early loans in this Bank in the face of statistical deficits,&#13;
&#13;
and in the case of one important country a loss of very&#13;
&#13;
important territories, sources of raw materials, and markets.&#13;
&#13;
It took a pretty bold man to sit down and calculate how some&#13;
&#13;
of these economies, faced with heavy destruction          physical&#13;
&#13;
destruction -- were going to get on their feet.        It was with&#13;
&#13;
no experience behind us collectively as a body.        It was a&#13;
&#13;
pretty bold decision to make these commitments that the Bank&#13;
made at that time.&#13;
&#13;
        I think behind it all was the basic fact that we placed&#13;
an intangible thing on the past history of these countries; th&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              55 
&#13;
fact 'We felt they 'Were people 'Who 'Wanted to pay their debts&#13;
&#13;
in the past and 'Who had physical, moral, and mental resources&#13;
&#13;
and capacities that 'Would be devoted to these problems.      There&#13;
&#13;
'Was a good deal of hope that that justified the decisions 'We&#13;
&#13;
made at that time.&#13;
&#13;
     I think this is some'What a similar problem.      There 'Were&#13;
&#13;
many questions 'We couldn't ans'Wer then as to ho'W these things&#13;
&#13;
'Would be done.   The only other thing, I repeat, is there are&#13;
&#13;
some opportunities in relation to Japan and the Pacific area&#13;
&#13;
that certainly challenge onets imagination, the possibilities&#13;
&#13;
of things that have been touched on here        development of ra'W&#13;
materials in one country for fabrication in another, the&#13;
&#13;
opening up of markets, perhaps cooperative investment in some&#13;
&#13;
of these things 'Which 'Will benefit the supplying country as&#13;
&#13;
'Well as Japan, 'Who could use those ra'W materials.    There are a&#13;
&#13;
number of examples that you kno'W of that I could quote.      None&#13;
&#13;
of those things are easy, and many factors of psychology as&#13;
&#13;
'Well as practical economics enter into that.&#13;
     There are old memories of hostilities and all that 'Which&#13;
&#13;
have to be allo'Wed to break do'Wn, the practical 'Working out of&#13;
&#13;
reparations and other deals.    But I think there is something&#13;
&#13;
in the thought, and the people that 'We have talked to that&#13;
&#13;
have looked at this Japanese situation, both from 'Within and&#13;
&#13;
'Without, that maybe the Bank, because it has a number of&#13;
&#13;
members in that area and a number of members 'Who have great&#13;
&amp;#12; interest in that area, can be from time to time of some help&#13;
&#13;
 in helping to fashion some of these things that will be of&#13;
&#13;
, mutual benefit to Japan and other countries; that this Bank&#13;
&#13;
 might make investments outside of Japan that would be importanti&#13;
&#13;
 to Japan's economy and likewise similar investments that might&#13;
&#13;
 be made in Japan that might be important to some of these&#13;
&#13;
 other economies.&#13;
&#13;
         I think it is a very challenging as well as a very&#13;
&#13;
 difficult problem.    We will attempt to the extent that we can&#13;
&#13;
 to make some contribution in that.&#13;
&#13;
         Again it is our thought that the situation makes it&#13;
&#13;
 inevitable that any operations will have to be step by step&#13;
&#13;
 and each step considered in the view of the developments that&#13;
&#13;
 Japan makes, and that we cannot -- and I think the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
 realize that -- simply ignore these things and make assumption&#13;
&#13;
 for the long future and thus make large lending without seeing&#13;
&#13;
 developments at each stage that will point towards the directi n&#13;
&#13;
 of the solution of these many problems that have been discusse&#13;
&#13;
 here.&#13;
&#13;
         I appreciate this opportunity.   I think this has been a&#13;
&#13;
 very useful discussion, and I appreciate the opportunity of&#13;
&#13;
 getting the views of the Board and pointing up these various&#13;
 aspects of what I think is well one of the most complicated&#13;
&#13;
 situations we face.&#13;
         If there is nothing more, there are a few other brief&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   57 
&#13;
items I would like to cover.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. YUMOTO:     I have to thank my colleagues that have made&#13;
&#13;
some investigation of the economic situation of my country,&#13;
&#13;
and also the many points that have been very helpful for           my&#13;
&#13;
country.   The present situation of my country is very         diffiCUl~,&#13;
and we are trying to tide this over by every means.&#13;
&#13;
     As to the suggestions made by Mr. Garner now, there may&#13;
&#13;
be some contribution which Japan can make in connection with&#13;
&#13;
the development of some countries in the Asian area which may&#13;
&#13;
be helpful for the development and rehabilitation of          my&#13;
&#13;
country.   I think that is a very good idea.       I know this&#13;
&#13;
project is challenging, but I hope you will work out some&#13;
&#13;
project which may be profitable to those countries as well as&#13;
&#13;
to my country.     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. SVEINBJORNSSON:        Mr. Chairman, I would like to make&#13;
one practical suggestion.        I think we all realize the&#13;
&#13;
importance of the situation in Japan, for various reasons.&#13;
&#13;
I would therefore like to suggest that this report should be&#13;
&#13;
supplemented now and then, not on the occasion of loan&#13;
&#13;
requests but just followed up as a means of keeping all of us&#13;
&#13;
in the picture of this very important area, if that is not&#13;
&#13;
asking too much.     I think it would be very useful if we could&#13;
&#13;
have this supplemented at least every half year, because this&#13;
&#13;
is important.&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     We will be glad to do that.     I might say&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         58&#13;
that was contemplated, that when and if this present loan is&#13;
consummated Mr. Dore, who is in charge of our relations with&#13;
Japan, and Mr. de Wilde and, if necessary, any other people of&#13;
the staff will go to Japan for a fairly protracted stay for&#13;
further studies and for discussions with the Japanese GovernÂ­&#13;
ment on many of these questions of major policy, and we will&#13;
when they come back make a report to you on their findings&#13;
&#13;
and further development.&#13;
