ABSTRACT OF THE STUDY&#13;
Social security systems in less developed countries and their&#13;
economic effects are still an unexplored area. They are very much in need of&#13;
study because, contrary to common belief, some sort of social security&#13;
program is in existence in almost all developing countries. Moreover,&#13;
existing programs are often costly, whether measured in relation to GNP,&#13;
government expenditure, government revenue, or the wage bill.&#13;
This paper is an attempt to examine the savings mobilization&#13;
potential of the sociaL security system in Chile. Tracing the development of&#13;
the Chilean system from its inception through 1977, when a major reform was&#13;
undertaken, the paper concludes that the savings mobilization goal is an&#13;
elusive one indeed, and suggests that the Chilean system has been, at various&#13;
times, a net dissaver. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison of&#13;
social security systems which have been successful at generating savings,&#13;
attempting to distill those factors which have been important in enabling&#13;
their success in this realm.&#13;

Chapter I&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Social security systems in less developed countries (LDC's) and their&#13;
possible economic effects are still a largely unexplored area. Both are very&#13;
much in need of study because, contrary to common belief, some sort of social&#13;
security program is in existence in most developing countries, and most of&#13;
the remainder are contemiplating introducing social insurance. Of the&#13;
approximately 120 countries classified as developing, 1/ 114 presently&#13;
provide, publically, some type of social insurance, although sometimes this&#13;
may be only of the most basic type, such as work-related injury compensation.&#13;
There is no developed country without a social insurance program. 2/&#13;
Moreover, the social security sector frequently looms large in the economies&#13;
of both developed as well as developing countries. Existing programs are&#13;
often costly whether measured as a proportion of government revenues or&#13;
expenditures, of GNP, in relation to the wage bill, or simply the number of&#13;
affiliates. For example, gross expenditures on social security in the&#13;
Philippines, a representative Asian country, make up 1.0% of GNP, with taxes&#13;
on wages averaging 8%. 3/ In Egypt, the social security sector makes up 4%&#13;
of GDP, and the the combined employer employee tax is 25%.    In Chile, the&#13;
country examined in greater depth in this paper, the social security sector&#13;
constitutes 10% of GNP and payroll taxes go as high as 48%. Moreover, there&#13;
is evidence that, at the macro level, the demand for social security is&#13;
highly income-elastic 4/ with programs tending to become broader and more&#13;
costly as per capita income rises. This is similar to the demand for private&#13;
pension and other insurance coverage. Thus, the issues raised by social&#13;
security programs and the problems which the mature systems face are of&#13;
increasing relevance to those countries which as yet do not have social&#13;
insurance programs, or whose programs are at present still relatively narrow.&#13;
A fundamental hypothesis of this paper is that there appears to be a&#13;
typical pattern along which social security systems have evolved in the&#13;

developed countrieso Developing countries planning to introduce some type of&#13;
social insurances, or those with young systems, can learn a great deal by&#13;
studying the developments which have typically led social securit.y in&#13;
developed countries to take on their by and large common shape. The develop-&#13;
ing countries also need to recognize the many pitfalls which have been&#13;
encountered along the w,ay, including the role of political processes and&#13;
pressure groups in the evolution of social security, the financin-g pitfalls,&#13;
and the tensions introduced by the redistributive aspects of most systemso&#13;
Equally important is an awareness of the ways in which the variouos issues,&#13;
such as redistribution versus insurance, adaptation of the original financing&#13;
methods, the growth of the system to lnclude new^y occupational groups and the&#13;
incorporation of new benefit regimes, have been resolved in the mwnture&#13;
systems and the implications which these choices have cazried with themo As&#13;
the system develops, it is important to keep in mind the rationaJ.e or the&#13;
objectives of social insuranceo Objectives can be anything from protecting&#13;
members of the labor force from the effects of income loss due to xwork-&#13;
related injuries, unemployment, illness or retirement, to a more comprehen-&#13;
sive system providing assistance for housing, schooling, ill health0 The&#13;
latter emphasizes income redistribution, the fomer, income maintenance0&#13;
Indirect objectives, such as the mobilization of savings through the creation&#13;
of a social security trust fund may also be an important objectfveo&#13;
The choice of a financing mode should also, in theory, be related to&#13;
the system's direct and indirect objectives, so that the financing mode,&#13;
together with the benefit structure, achieves the desired objectives0    Typi-&#13;
cally, however, tradition plays a larger part in this choice then does an&#13;
explicit acknowledgment and analysis of the objectives or rationale for the&#13;
systemo&#13;
Of further interest to countries whose social insurance systems are&#13;
still only partially developed is an awareness of the various economic&#13;
effects of social insurance and the implications of the design of the system&#13;
for incentives to work, to save and to retlre0 The varlous types of "'mature"&#13;
social insurance systems provide a wide range of lessons on this score,&#13;
although the debate over many of the economic effects is still Inconclusive0&#13;
The effect of social security on savings is perhaps the moet important,&#13;
it has implications on the incentives to work, to save, and to retire0 In&#13;
addition, in less developed countries, a trust-fund type socia. insurance&#13;
system frequently seen as a meane of mobili2ing savings for development&#13;
purposes - killing two birds with one stoneo&#13;
The saving potential of social security has long been reccgnized0&#13;
Surpluses generated by the system can provide an additional anc -- given&#13;
certain population dynamics 5/ i- increasing fountain of resources for the&#13;
5/ e.go, Rapid labor force growth0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
country's development efforts. In countries where coverage is extensive and&#13;
the compulsory contributions of employers and employees are high, the&#13;
"savings" of the social security system (defined as the difference between&#13;
their annual receipts and expenditures) can be quite substantial. In some&#13;
countries such as Syria and Egypt, for example, where the systems are young,&#13;
the savings amount to up to 50% of receipts. In Malaysia, the Philippines,&#13;
Singapore, Sri Lanka and India, surpluses are almost as high: about 35-40% of&#13;
receipts. This can mean that savings amounting to over 2% of GNP are being&#13;
generated through the social insurance system. 6/ The resource allocation&#13;
aspects may also be important. An actively managed pension fund can con-&#13;
tribute to the widening of the national capital market, provided government&#13;
securities are not the sole investment permitted. The distribution of the&#13;
savings generated by the system is also likely to contain a far higher&#13;
proportion of domestic securities than a similar volume of savings, privately&#13;
held. Social insurance systems are also frequently important holders of&#13;
government securities and provide the public sector with a source of borrowed&#13;
funds to be channelled into development.&#13;
It is in this savings-for-development area where the lessons of the&#13;
"mature" systems are particularly instructive. The savings mobilization&#13;
goal, judging from a number of case histories, is amongst the most elusive.&#13;
While the ability of the social security sector to mobilize resources is not&#13;
disputed, the question of whether the surpluses generated through it provide&#13;
additional "savings", and whether the total value of national savings is&#13;
increased, remains open. This depends on how the surpluses are managed, and&#13;
on how the system affects other savings behavior. For example, if household&#13;
savings decline once the system guarantees a well-provided retirement (as&#13;
life-cycle savings theories would suggest) or if the system receives net&#13;
transfers from the government which are deficit rather than tax-financed, the&#13;
net change in savings may be very different from the system's savings mobi-&#13;
lization taken in isolation. Moreover, the real savings mobilization poten-&#13;
tial of the system depends on the ability to keep the trust fund intact,&#13;
inviolate to changes in the benefit and in-payment regimes, and safe from the&#13;
predations of inflation which erode its real value. The lessons offered by&#13;
mature systems suggest that these may be the greatest difficulties. The&#13;
development to maturity of many social security programs appears to include&#13;
the transformation of the systems' financial basis from a trust fund to a&#13;
pay-as-you-go arrangement, in which there is no generation of surpluses and&#13;
hence, no savings mobilization, since the benefits are essentially a transfer&#13;
payment from the present labor force to the generation of retired folk. A&#13;
further maturation appears to involve, ultimately, an end to payroll tax&#13;
financing and the private insurance analogy. Instead social insurance&#13;
benefits are financed through the national tax system, through which social&#13;
security becomes firmly entrenched in the budget.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This paper will seek to explain how this transformation takes place, and&#13;
why it is a near inevitability, given the pressures faced by social security&#13;
systems in the course of their development. Usi~ng a case study of Chile, the&#13;
paper will trace the development of the Chilean system, from its beginn!ngs&#13;
as a funded system to its maturity, analyzing the economic and managerial&#13;
factors which led to the erosion of the system trust fund, as well as other&#13;
factors which reduced its savings mobilizatton potential. The Chilean system&#13;
is an interesting case; it is representative of social security systems in a&#13;
number of developing countries in Latin America, being in many w&amp;ys a typical&#13;
"mature" system. It also provides a sharply contrasting picture with respect&#13;
to coverage and methods of financing with many of the Asian social insurance&#13;
systems, which are frequently thought of as the social insurance ":success&#13;
stories"0  It is also instructive, since the pressures and pitfalls the&#13;
system has faced in the course of its development may become more quite&#13;
common, with similar pressures likely to develop in still immature systems&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
The layout of the paper is as follows: Chapter two presents a review of&#13;
the literature on social security and savings, beginning with a discussion of&#13;
the manner in which social security gross surpluses are generated and the&#13;
factors which contribute to the greater or lesser savings mobilization poten-&#13;
tial of any given system0 Then follows a survey of the theoretical and&#13;
empirical literature on social securlty and savings , from Keynes to the&#13;
present0 The chapter ends with a discussion of the pros and cons of funded&#13;
(savings generating) and unfunded systems, demonstrating the conditions under&#13;
which pay-as-you-go systems are able to pay out higher benefits in the short&#13;
run than funded systems.&#13;
Chapter three opens with a general survey of social security systems,&#13;
and a discussion of what exactly is meant by social security0    The Chilean&#13;
system is discussed0 Issues relating to the system, the degree to which its&#13;
redistributive aims have been achieved, _ts eff7ciency and administrative&#13;
costs, its investment policy, and the most important of all, the ultimate&#13;
inability of the system to deliver contractual benefits except by large scale&#13;
bail-out from the central government 7/     a situation of large, positive&#13;
dissaving -- are discussed0&#13;
Chapter four describes the experience of some typical Asian systems&#13;
generally regarded as "success stories" from the point of view of their&#13;
continued financial viability and their adjunct performance in the field of&#13;
national savings mobilizationo The social insurance systems of the Philip-&#13;
pines, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and India are discussed in some detail0&#13;
Their ability to remain tightly controlled and limited in terms of benefits&#13;
and beneficiaries is in direct contrast to the Chilean scheme (and many other&#13;

&#13;

mature schemes) and sheds some light on what it takes to achieve this finan-&#13;
cial viability and success.&#13;
The concluding chapter suggests that n the course of maturation, ten-&#13;
sions between financial viability and success in the redistributive arena are&#13;
inevitable, and that a social security scheme, if it is to provide risk&#13;
protection to the broad population at risk is not financially viable and must&#13;
ultimately be financed from general revenues.&#13;

Social Security: The Savings Issues&#13;
There are two aspects to the social security and savings mob:lization&#13;
issue. The first has to do with the conditions under which social security&#13;
institutions can generate surpluses or savings, given the desirability of&#13;
establishing a funded system from the point of view of both the beneficiaries&#13;
and the economy. This is the gross savings mobilization aspect and is a&#13;
function of demographic trends and the design of the system0 The net savings&#13;
generated through a social security scheme may be quite different. The&#13;
second aspect of the question comprises the varicus factors, which cause the&#13;
net increase in savings to differ from the first round gross savings mobi-&#13;
lized by the institutions. These could be, for example, to a decline in&#13;
household savings, or budgetary transfers to social security institutions&#13;
which are deficits, rather than tax-financed.&#13;
Methods of Financing&#13;
Social security systems can be financed either via capitalization or on&#13;
a pay-as-you-go basis0 Only the former generate savingso In a capitalized&#13;
system, the taxes1, or in-payments of the current economically active popula-&#13;
tion are accumulated over their working lives in a "trust fund", out of wthich&#13;
their pensions are subsequently disbursed. The interest earned on the&#13;
accumulating fund determines1, ca                the level of benefits which&#13;
can be paid out, or what the retiree will get in addition to his original&#13;
contributions0 If the system is actuarially sound, outstanding liabilities&#13;
will be equal to the accumulated trust fund, i/ and there will be no need for&#13;
outside subsidy0 Population dynamics will determine the size of the trust&#13;
fund and the rate at which it grows0 With a closed and constant population,&#13;
i.e. Dno immigration, and a net reproductive rate of one, the total w^ealth of&#13;
the social security system reaches its maximum when the first generation of&#13;
affiliates reaches ret:rement, and levels off thereafter, as the follo~rirng&#13;
diagram indicates. From time N1 to RI, the fizsGt generation of affiliates is&#13;
employed, and contributes at a rate t to the social security trust fund0     It&#13;
is assumed for convenience that income and hence contributions are constant1,&#13;
so that the increments to the trust fund can be represented by a straight&#13;
line0 At time R D the first generation retires, and actuarial t-enefits are&#13;
provided, equal lo their total social security wealth, either in a lump sum&#13;
or amortized over the period R to MaO At maturity, the system will be&#13;
generating a constant stream ol savings equal to W1 (=Wr)d, i      the scheme&#13;
is in perpetuity0&#13;
1/ Or more precisely, accumulations plus the "interest assumpt'cn" equal&#13;
liabilities0&#13;

With a growing population (or income growth), the trust fund of the&#13;
system will continue to grow as long as each generation is larger than the&#13;
one which preceded it. Conversely, a shrinking population or declining&#13;
income level will generate a declining level of gross savings.&#13;
A pay-as-you-go-scheme, on the other hand, uses the contributions of the&#13;
present working generation to pay for the benefits to the previous generation&#13;
of retired folk.&#13;

At any time, social securitv savings are zero: in a constant, closed&#13;
population the retirement benefits exactly offset the taxes o- the employed&#13;
generation. Some accumulation may take places since reserves are maintained&#13;
for contingencies0    HoWever, savings in the sense of a p2rmanerl increment&#13;
to national wealth can only be mobilized through a funded scheme, 2! Popula-&#13;
tion dynamics are important here as well, since the age structure of the&#13;

of financing their parent generation's retirement (rectangle B), relative to&#13;
what they themselves stand to receive (rectangle C). In this representation,&#13;
population is assumed to be closed and constant, so the rectangles are all&#13;
the same size. If population growth or income growth is allowed, rectangles&#13;
A and B will be smaller than rectangle C, assuming an unchanged contributory&#13;
rate.&#13;
Pay-as-you-go schemes are frequently introduced because of the problems&#13;
of excluding those who are already retired (Ro) when the social insurance&#13;
system is first introduced, and waiting until the entire first generation of&#13;
affiliates has paid in its full complement (at R1 N2) before beginning any&#13;
outpayments. In addition to this difficult decision to be made at the sys-&#13;
tems' inception, there is another reason for the popularity of pay-as-you-go&#13;
systems, namely that benefit levels can be higher, in the medium term, for&#13;
any given level of contributions.&#13;
Samuelson's consumption loan model first provided this attractive&#13;
economic rationale for the pay-as-you-go schemes. The model implied that&#13;
with a growing population and labor force, it was better to have a pay-as-&#13;
you-go system than a capitalized one, since the benefits paid out under the&#13;
former would always be larger than under the latter, as long as each gener-&#13;
ation, supported the preceeding one in accordance with the social contract.&#13;
This would obtain because under a capitalized scheme, the effective rate of&#13;
return on social security (the benefits received for the paid-in contribu-&#13;
tions) was constrained by the rate of return on investment in the economy&#13;
(r). Under the pay-as-you-go mode, the constraint was the rate of growth of&#13;
the labor force plus productivity growtli (n + d), Samuelson called the&#13;
"biological rate of interest". Assuming that technological change affected&#13;
labor and capital productivity equally, (n + d) was always greater than r the&#13;
rate of interest. The pay-as-you-go scheme could, therefore, generate a&#13;
higher level of benefits than could the capitalized fund, which could never&#13;
offer a return higher than the interest, or profit rate.&#13;
The conditions under which the optimality of pay-as-you-go financing&#13;
held were, howzever, fairLy restrictive. These were that there be no store&#13;
of value in the economy, and hence, no means of capital accumulation.    In&#13;
such a scenario, no savings were possible, and therefore, a social security&#13;
scheme based on the capitalization of inpayments was entirely infeasible.&#13;
Samuelson's conclusion, that a pay-as-you-go scheme, rootecl in the social&#13;
contract, was an efficienat means of "saving", must be regarded in this con-&#13;
text.&#13;
In fact, Samuelson's assumptions about the impossibility of zapital&#13;
accumulation need not be met for pay-as-you-go financing, at a practical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
level, to be the preferred alternative. 3/ Pay-as-you-go is likely to be&#13;
preferred as long as the economy's growth rate, n + d, exceeds the rate of&#13;
interest, r, as the following diagram shows.&#13;

The line aA, the consumer's budget line, represents the trade off&#13;
between consumption in the two periods, with slope -(1 +r). Alternatively,&#13;
it can be viewed as the rate at which a fully funded social security scheme,&#13;
earning "r" on its investments, can transform current social insurance taxes&#13;
(in amount of Ab) into future benefits for the individual.&#13;
If instead a social insurance program is introduced and financed via a&#13;
pay-as-you-go method, its implicit rate of return, as noted by Samuelson,&#13;
3/ This is because, at a practical, or political level, the general equi-&#13;
librium effects -- to the extent that savings are in fact reduced -- of an&#13;
unfunded system on the capital stock and wage rental ratio are not as&#13;
perceptible as the more obvious differential in the payroll taxes required&#13;
to provide the same benefits under the two different systems.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will be the population growth rate plus the rate of growth of productivity,&#13;
n + d. If n + d&gt;r, the rate of transformation between present and future&#13;
consumption is given by line segment AB, where point b corresponds to the&#13;
percentage of current income which is transformable into future income via&#13;
the social security system at the rate n + d. Since the remaining income&#13;
when saved can only be transformed into future income at the rate (1 + r),&#13;
the rate of return on savings, this is the slope of line segment BC. When&#13;
(n + d) is less than the interest rate, the budget line is ADE, and&#13;
pay-as-you-go financing Ls clearly worse, from the point of view of yield,&#13;
than capitalization. The framework here is a partial equilibrium one:.&#13;
Because the Samuelson scenario assumes no capital accumulation, the long-term&#13;
growth and resource allocation implications of an unfunded system are com-&#13;
pletely ignored.&#13;
The International Labour Organisation, on a much less arcane level than&#13;
that of Samuelson, has a:Lso been a proponent of pay-as-you-go systems. A&#13;
dominant theme in its social security literature 4/ throughout the 1960's&#13;
was the implications of payroll taxes for employment. Capitalized funds were&#13;
held to have a very high cost in terms of labor displacement, higher than&#13;
unfunded systems, since a higher initial rate of tax is required while the&#13;
reserve fund is built up. Moreover, in addition to labor displacement, the&#13;
capitalization premium raises the cost of pension coverage to early&#13;
affiliates whose taxes build up the reserve fund. In short, the capitaliza-&#13;
tion premium was held to make the systems unnecessarily expensive, and&#13;
pay-as-you-go was to be preferred. Funding was necessary, in the ILO view,&#13;
for small, private pension funds, but not for compulsory public insurance&#13;
programs.&#13;
In the more recenc literature on social insurance and savings,&#13;
[Feldstein (1974) and Darby, (1978) explicitly, and implicit in Munnell&#13;
(1974), Barro (1977), Kot:likoff (1979)] the advantages of funded as opposed&#13;
to pay-as-you-go systems derive from the general equilibrium effects of a&#13;
higher savings rate on the capital stock. The optimal growth rule [Phelps&#13;
(1961) Cass and Yaari (1967)] is the backdrop implicit in much of the&#13;
theoretical debate. The implicit contention of those emphasizing the effects&#13;
of social security on savings and the advantages of funding, is that the&#13;
situation which prevails is n + d less than r. The actual profit rate and&#13;
the capital labor ratio is high, this side of steady state maximum consump-&#13;
tion, where savings must be increased (funding of the social security system&#13;
is one vehicle) to move towards the optimum. Here, pay-as-you-go financing&#13;
is sub-optimal, since consumption is less than the steady state maximum, and&#13;
the tradeoff between future and current consumption less than it need be.&#13;
The "yield" of the system will also be lower. It is on this reasoning that&#13;
Feldstein estimates the efficiency losses due to pay-as-you-go financing in&#13;
the US. The situation described by n + d greater than r, under which higher&#13;
4/ See International Social Security Review, ILO, Geneva, various issues.&#13;
-11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
benefits can be provided by a pay-as-you-go than a funded system, would&#13;
correspond to a situation of excessive capital intensity, where the profit&#13;
rate has been depressed by over-investment and has fallen below the rate of&#13;
growth. Consumption is :Lower than the maximum steady state consumption,&#13;
achieved where g = n + d equals r. In such a case, the consumption could be&#13;
increased by reducing savings and returning to the optimal capital intensity&#13;
for the economy (which is what the pay-as-you-go system would encourage).&#13;
However, the optima:L growth framework obscures many of the real-world&#13;
aspects of any social security system. More often than not, social security&#13;
institutions do not invest at the "profit rate", but at some interest rate,&#13;
the government bond or some other rate, r*, always lower than the profit&#13;
rate. The wedge between the profit rate and r* (if r*&lt;g&lt;r) brings about a&#13;
divergence between what is good for the economy and what maximizes the rate&#13;
of growth of benefits for the recipients. In this sense, there is no incon-&#13;
sistency between the perception that the economy may be suffering from&#13;
under-savings and under- investment, while at the same time distortions in&#13;
market interest rate and tax policy give rise to a-situation in which inter-&#13;
est rates to the social insurance institutions are such that a pay-as-you-go&#13;
system can provide higher benefits.   This point is crucial, since it figures&#13;
importantly among the reasons for the eventual decapitalization of many&#13;
initially-funded social security programs.&#13;
The Generation of Surpluses&#13;
As the preceding discussion points out, only funded social security&#13;
systems can generate surpluses which represent a permanent increment to the&#13;
nation's stock of wealth. In practical terms, this means that the savings or&#13;
surpluses which a social security system can generate are a function of its&#13;
design and its coverage. By design is meant, among other things, the rela-&#13;
tive emphasis given to protection against short-term as against long-term&#13;
risks. For example, since health care programs, maternity benefits,&#13;
unemployment or family allowances cannot be sensibly financed on a funded&#13;
basis, the surplus as a fraction of receipts is likely to be much smaller&#13;
when these regimes predominate in the overall package of protection than&#13;
under a differently oriented beneFit structure.   Surpluses are likely to be&#13;
largest in a system which emphasizes long-term risks such as old age, dis-&#13;
ability, death and survivorship, where the nature of the risk pooling makes&#13;
funded financing both possible and appropriate.&#13;
The maturity of the system is a second factor affecting the size of the&#13;
surpluses. A "young" system will have few maturing claims relative to its&#13;
receipts, and will accumulate far larger surpluses than a system in equi-&#13;
librium. This holds a fortiori, if the population is growing, since the age&#13;
distribution will also contribute to an excess of receipts over claims in the&#13;
short run. In the longer term, as a system matures, the outstanding&#13;
liabilities must be met, and the surplus settles down its equilibrium level.&#13;
-12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The cost of administering the system also bears on the proportion of&#13;
receipts which can be saved. Many countries fix legal ceilings on&#13;
administrative costs, but even so, the range is wide, from 3-15% of annual&#13;
receipts. 5/ Much of this variance is a function of the system's design.&#13;
Short-term risks are more costly to administer than long-term -- this is&#13;
especially true of public: health programs and maternity and infant care which&#13;
tend to be provided "in kind" rather than in cash benefits. The extension of&#13;
benefits to rural populations also increases overheads considerably, with the&#13;
need for regional offices and duplication of personnel. In general,&#13;
geographic extension of social security programs is administratively costly.&#13;
Narrow and retirement-based programs of the provident fund type are the most&#13;
efficient in terms of converting contributions into benefits.&#13;
The accuracy of the actuarial base of the system over time is crucial to&#13;
the generation of cash surpluses. If changing demographic trends or changing&#13;
trends in affiliation are not continuously incorporated into financial&#13;
forecasts, the solvency of the system may be jeopardized. The rate of growth&#13;
of wages (the wage assumption) and the interest rate on the reserve fund (the&#13;
interest assumption) must also be accurately predicted. An increase in the&#13;
rate of return on the fund's assets of one percentage point can reduce the&#13;
cost, over an average span of contributions, by 25%. If wages grow faster by&#13;
one percentage point tharn expected, the cost of a fixed benefit package can&#13;
be reduced by 13%. 6/ These are large magnitudes: overestimates of wages&#13;
growth or interest rates can quickly upset the solvency of a scheme.&#13;
Finally, there is th,e impact of inflation. How inflation affects the&#13;
system's liabilities as compared with its receipts, and its implications for&#13;
the rate of return which can be obtained in the social security reserve fund,&#13;
will determine the level and the trend in the cash surpluses. If benefits&#13;
are overindexed, or contribution levels fall below the actuarially planned&#13;
levels (for example, if the income ceiling remains fixed too long) the cash&#13;
surpluses will be reduced and full capitalization becomes impossible.&#13;
To sum up, the higher compulsory contributions, the more affiliates&#13;
there are, the more long-term risk protection is the mainstay of the system,&#13;
and the lower the costs of administration, the higher will be the absolute&#13;
savings which the system can generate.&#13;
Social Security Surpluses: New Savings or Not?&#13;
While the demographic and other conditions may prevail so that the&#13;
social security trust fund can be built up, the surpluses mobilized by social&#13;
insurance institutions need not necessarily represent net additions to&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
national savings. The theoretical literature has focused or. two main avenues&#13;
through which the system of social provision may induce changes which would&#13;
have to be offset against the gross surpluses generated by themo The first&#13;
of these is the impact of social security on households, who, with retirement&#13;
provision guaranteed, may reduce their own discretionary savings for retire-&#13;
ment [Feldstein (1977a, 1974b); Munnell (1977a, 1974b)], their precautionary&#13;
balances (should the social insurance system offer other benefits, such as&#13;
health insurance or workmens' compensation), and eliminate the bequest motive&#13;
for saving (Barro, 1974, 1977) when the system pays survivors' pensions0 The&#13;
second approach has been the effect of social insurance on government&#13;
savings. Here, the focus is on the tax aspect, not the benefit side, of the&#13;
system0 In a "itaxable capacity" model, payroll taxes act as a brake on the&#13;
government's ability to raise further revenues via direct taxes, End thus,&#13;
curb the size of the possible government surplus0 7/ (Reviglio, )967a,&#13;
1967b)  It is the balance of these and other effects, as against the savings&#13;
mobilized by the system, from which the net savings impact can be determined.&#13;
Thus, notwithstanding a decline in household or central government savings,&#13;
total savings need not decline, provided the reduction in savings is fully&#13;
offset by savings of the social security institutions themselves, wzhich will&#13;
occur provided the system is fully funded0&#13;
Since the attributes of social secarity make it a highly imperfect&#13;
substitute for private savings, the decliine in private savfings is likely to&#13;
be less than one for one0  Therefore, ill a fully funded system, to-al&#13;
national savings may increase0 Should the government be able to raise more&#13;
in social security tax revenues than would be saved voluntarily, a capital-&#13;
ized system will always imply higher savings rates regardless of the behavior&#13;
of private savings0 A decline in nati_onal savings comes about only if the&#13;
public savings of the social security institutions do not replace the reduc-&#13;
tion which may be induced in private savings, the most common case being&#13;
where the social security system is financed on a pay-as-you-go rtiennero&#13;
In short, if national savings decline as a result of the introduction of&#13;
a social security system, it is the fact that the current benefits are paid&#13;
out of taxes on current earnings rather than out ojE an accumulaterl fun6 of&#13;
tax plus interest which leads to this decline0  in a capitalized Lystem,&#13;
savings, private or government, may indeed be reduced. But the f1-unding&#13;
simply implies a change in the form which the savings take. thley are ao less&#13;
savings for being in the reserve fund cf the social secu-ity insti-.ution.&#13;
The sections which follow survey the trzoreticel and nho empirica   literature&#13;
on the social security and household savings hypotheses,&#13;
7/ This assumes that the government's mwarginal propensity to save is equal&#13;
to one, i.e. opposite of the "Please Effect".&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Effects of Social Security on Personal Savings&#13;
Before the advent of social insurance and guaranteed retirement incomes,&#13;
a person's own savinigs, (or those of his children) provided his only means of&#13;
support in retirement. I'he question which naturally arises is whether the&#13;
introduction of social security pensions and other benefits which may cover&#13;
most of the labor force, has done anything to change household savings&#13;
behavior.&#13;
The earliest work on social security and savings focused exclusively&#13;
on the implications of the payroll tax for savings, rather than the possible&#13;
impact of the benefit expenditures themselves. A characteristic analysis&#13;
suggested that payroll tax financing for social security was far less&#13;
detrimental to savings than the same revenues raised through an income tax,&#13;
since the social security tax was levied on labor income alone, typically,&#13;
at proportional rather than progressive rates, and was subject to an income&#13;
ceiling. Thus, the payroll tax burdened only those who spent what they&#13;
earned -- it did not reduce the disposable income of the affluent who were&#13;
held to save, rather than spend.&#13;
More recent analysis has focused on the implications of social insurance&#13;
benefits for savings. Harrod's (1938) "hump savings" hypothesis has provided&#13;
the foundation for this approach, although Harrod was not directly concerned&#13;
with social security. The hump savings theory held that the principal motive&#13;
for household saving was the provision for retirement. In this model, the&#13;
savings which were accumulated during the working years would be just suffi-&#13;
cient to provide an individual with an unchanged standard of living during&#13;
retirement, so that net saving over the life cycle would be zero. Harrod's&#13;
two-period analysis, (subsequently formalized and extended to a multi-period&#13;
framework by Modigliani and Brumberg (1956)) can provide an appropriate&#13;
framework for analyzing the impact of social insurance on savings, since&#13;
social security benefits and personal savings for retirement are in many ways&#13;
substitutes for one another. In this model, the discretionary savings of&#13;
households would be expected to decline pari passu with the "savings" implied&#13;
by an individual's social insurance contributions, because of this substitu-&#13;
tion effect.&#13;
Seymour Harris (1941) was among the first to formally link social&#13;
security and savings, and to predict a decline in savings due to social&#13;
security, although he did not formalize the mechanism by which it would come&#13;
about to the extent which more recent treatments of the question have done.&#13;
The context, too, was entirely different from that of present studies, since&#13;
he and other early American Keynesians were concerned with an excessive&#13;
(rather than deficient) savings rate, and the stimulation of consumption to&#13;
reduce unemployment. Social security was hailed at this time as a means&#13;
through which a permanent lowering of the savings rate could be brought&#13;
-15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about. J0 M0 Keynes was also a proponent of this view, that social security&#13;
would lower household savings0 8/&#13;
A surprising result uncovered by early e,npirical work on the subject&#13;
was that personal savings and affiliation with a private pension scheme (and&#13;
by extension, to social security) were positively correlated. Those wlhose&#13;
retirements were provided for by private pension coverage had higher discre-&#13;
tionary savings than those entirely without pension entitlementso Katona's&#13;
(1965) study used a 1963 household survey carried out by the Survey Research&#13;
Center of the University of Michigan, -in which a random sample of household&#13;
heads in the United States were interviewed, (Very low income groups were&#13;
excluded from the sample on the grounds that their discretion in altering&#13;
their savings-consumption patterns was extremely limited0) His regression&#13;
findings lent no support to the common assumption about the substitutability&#13;
of expected pension benefits and discretionary savings0 Quite t'e contrary,&#13;
private pensions measured as (i) expected pension income, and (ii) pension&#13;
plan affiliation were shown to have stimulated private savings.&#13;
Another study by P. Cagan (1965), focused on che contributory side of&#13;
pension schemes0 This again was a cross-section study and used survey data&#13;
of a 1958-59 mail-out questionnaire to "Consumers Reports" subscribers0    His&#13;
findings once again indicated that pension contributions are positively&#13;
linked to savings0 They also suggest that the hnigher savings rate of the&#13;
covered households is at the expense of consumer durable purchases, rather&#13;
than current expenditures0 Highest savings were found among groups whose&#13;
pensions were only partially vested, indicailig that insecurity about retire-&#13;
ment income also played a part in the savings decision0 Moreover, the rela-&#13;
tion between savings and the level of contributicns was nonlinear. When&#13;
contributions were a small fraction (four to $ive percent) of income, savings&#13;
were increased; thereafter the relation, though still positive, ievelled off&#13;
gradually.&#13;
Since these two early studies, most subsequent theoretical literature&#13;
has approached the social security/household savings issue Through the hump&#13;
savings or life cycle model0 From this point of view, the Katona and Cagan&#13;
conclusions are paradoxical, because evea v^when the life cycle model is&#13;
amended for greater realism, allowir.g for altiernac2 mo'tives for savings such&#13;
as bequests, while the strength of the subotitution effect may be reduced,&#13;
over all the conclusions of the life cycle appro&amp;cIk sh.ould remai.n substan-&#13;
tially unaltered0  There are indeed many insniL-ctional factors whhich make&#13;
social security a less than perfect substitute Fo- private savings, even&#13;
though both serve the same ultimate purpose- Ul-like discre,ionary savings,&#13;
savings embodied in social security form are J1licquid; they do not constitute&#13;
a reserve for emergencies, nor can they provide collateral against which&#13;
savers may borrow0 They can never be paid out before retirement, and even&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
then, not in lump sum form unless the system is a provident fund. Moreover,&#13;
social security provides for all retired persons on the basis of their&#13;
incomes. Provisions are not varied to suit individual tastes. In short, the&#13;
social security form of "wealth" cannot substitute perfectly for wealth&#13;
accumulated through discretionary savings. The existence of the bequest&#13;
motive for saving alone is sufficient to limit the degree to which social&#13;
security wealth or savings and own-savings are good substitutes for each&#13;
other.&#13;
These points, while highlighting the imperfect nature of the sub-&#13;
stitutability between these two types of wealth and acknowledging additional&#13;
motives for savings, still leave the life cycle approach substantially unal-&#13;
tered. Substitution should still occur, although the tradeoff between own&#13;
savings and social security savings may be reduced. How then should the&#13;
observation, that those with alternate forms of retirement protection save&#13;
more than those with no expectation of a retirement income, be explained?&#13;
Katona's 1965 study suggested that it is conceivable that the minimal protec-&#13;
tion afforded by collective insurance plan stimulates people to save in order&#13;
to achieve a more adequate and complete level of protection. This was called&#13;
the "goal gradient" effect, a term borrowed from industrial psychology. In&#13;
aspiration theory, success causes individuals to raise their sights, and&#13;
failure to lower them. Thus, as the first step towards retirement provision&#13;
is made through the pension fund, a more adequate and complete level of&#13;
protection becomes within reach and individual savings are increased. Pen-&#13;
sion benefits could be supplemented with one's own private savings, and the&#13;
two together could provide an adequate retirement lifestyle.&#13;
Cagan explained the positive relationship via a "recognition effect",&#13;
in which a "plan instituted among a large group of workers more or less at&#13;
random, crystallized dormant savings intentions, and induced an increase in&#13;
their own savings."9/ The recognition effect, by bringing about a new aware-&#13;
ness of retirement needs, will remind individuals of the importance of saving&#13;
on their own.&#13;
Cagan also admitted the existence of a substitution effect. It is this&#13;
which explained his finding of non-linearity of the contributions- savings&#13;
relationship and the differences in behavior between those belonging to&#13;
vested and to non-vested plans. The non-linearity resulted because the&#13;
recognition effect dominated at low contributory levels, while substitution&#13;
prevailed once contributions become extremely high. Vesting, on the other&#13;
hand, implies that benefits are secure, therefore enhances the pension's&#13;
value to the household, thereby generating a more powerful "recognition"&#13;
effect. With partial or no vesting, the recognition effect is overwhelmed&#13;

by the substitution effects, which acccunts for the lower savings rate of&#13;
those with non-vested pension plans0 Cagan notes also that the ircome tax&#13;
system, which makes it cheaper to provide for retirement through pension&#13;
plans than own savings, provides yet another incentive to substtiute pension&#13;
contributions for personal saving effort. Nonetheless, such countervailing&#13;
effects appeared to have insufficient strength to reverse the influence of&#13;
the recognition mechanism: pensions and personal saving remained complements.&#13;
The "modern" economist's difficulty with these rationa7e, "goal&#13;
gradient" or "recognition", and simple regression models 's that they cannot&#13;
be modelled into the traditional theory of consumer behavior. Neither are&#13;
they explainable via the common garden variety of utility maximizing model,&#13;
since the hypothesized explanations have no microeconomic foundations.&#13;
Most of the recent theoretical work putting forth new hypotheses to&#13;
address Cagan and Katona's observation that pension coverage stimulates&#13;
personal savings, has been firmly rooted in traditional micro-economic theory&#13;
(Feldstein, 1974a, 1974b; Munnell, 1974a, 1974b; Barro 1977)o Feldstein and&#13;
Munnell's work is an extension of the Modigliani/Brumburg life-cycle model,&#13;
which holds that provision for retirement is the motive for household&#13;
savings. In the basic life-cycle model, each individual is assumed to have&#13;
a consistent preference function over his lifespan which he will maximize&#13;
subject to a lifetime bud,get constraint,&#13;
Max:         U = u(cl, c2, C3 0o0 Cnn B)&#13;
n1                      R             -t&#13;

t=1                      t=1&#13;
where c refers to consumption in period tD B (which may be equal to 0) repre-&#13;
sents the bequests which the individual intends to leave behind and R repre-&#13;
sents the retirement ageo&#13;
In a simplied two-period (Fisher, Harrod) framework and assum:Ang a zero&#13;
rate of time preference, the individual will wish to equalize his consumption&#13;
in each period, so that CL = C2 = C. Diagramatically, this is determined by&#13;
point A,&#13;

where tangency between budget line with slope -(l+r) and the individual's&#13;
indifference curve occurs. The 45 degree expansion path is generated by the&#13;
"Hemingway assumption" (homothetic indifference curves) whiclh insures that&#13;
C1   C2 = C regardless of income level.   The rich thus exhibit the same&#13;
inter-temporal consumption preferences as do the poor, they just consume more&#13;
in each period.&#13;
If the first period represents the individual's economically active&#13;
period, and the second the period of retirement, the income stream over the&#13;
lifecycle will be described by:&#13;
r  t                0 &lt;t&lt; (1-R)T&#13;
Yt =&#13;
0                       t &gt; (1-R)T&#13;
where T is total lifespan, R is the proportion of years in retirement, and&#13;
T(l-R) the years spent in active employment.&#13;
For consumption levels in retirement to be the same as consumption&#13;
levels whi, employed, savings during the first period will have to be suffi-&#13;
cient to c_&gt; r consumption during the second, when income from work falls to&#13;
zero.&#13;
The lifetime budget constraint (assuming for simplicity that the income&#13;
stream is constant) in this notation becomes:&#13;
-19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Y = Yt (l-R)T&#13;
and if there are no bequests, then&#13;
Y = Yt (l-R)T = C&#13;
will also hold, since savings over the lifecycle are zero0 ConsuhTption each&#13;
period, denoted by ctD iS then:&#13;
Ct = C/T = (l-R)yt&#13;
and savings (yt - ct) therefore,&#13;
S t = Yt ( 1-R)yt&#13;
or simply,&#13;
St = Ryt9&#13;
incomes times the percentage of lifespan spent in retirement (R).&#13;
In the lifecycle model then, the labor force participation decision and&#13;
income jointly determine the rate of savings. The longer tne per`od of&#13;
retirement, the greater will be personal savings.&#13;
Social security has been accommodated in an expanded lifecyclo model&#13;
in various ways. Feldstein's (1974) basic equation, estimated fr-c 1929-1971&#13;
US times series data is:&#13;
C = a + b1YDt + b2YDt-1 + b3RE + b4l' + b5RU + b6SSW&#13;
where C is household expenditures, YD is household disoosablz ?ncac e, RE is&#13;
corporate retained earnings, W is the net wocth ocf households, 2L is the rate&#13;
of unemployment and SSW is a variable represenLing the weaith of 11ouseholds&#13;
defined by their future social security benefits.&#13;
The "wealth effect" of social security reprcsencs the Link h2tTeen&#13;
social security and consumption, and its effects on consump`ion a..  theoreti-&#13;
cally indeterminate. The "wealth effect" is compris-e of' two sepE.a-aLe,&#13;
countervailing influences. On the one hand, consumptic-;t can -'ncrease because&#13;
the promise of social security benefits reduces the n     Â£or- indiinUEi&#13;
savings for retirement. This substitution of social secu.ity    fn-cs for&#13;
private discretionary savings is what FeXdsteln calls i-he cU:sse. s&amp;astitution&#13;

retirement effect"', which results as social secu-ity baenef{ts comra close to&#13;

test, encourages early retirement0&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The "induced" retirement effect of social security can be formally&#13;
incorporated into this framework by incorporating leisure into the utility&#13;
function, so that an income/leisure tradeoff is introduced (Feldstein 1976).&#13;
The utility in each period is described by the function&#13;
ui = U (Ci, Li),&#13;
where C is consumption and L represents leisure.&#13;
When social insurance is introduced, consumption in retirement derives from&#13;
own income and from social security benefits. The utility function thus&#13;
becomes&#13;
i   u(Bi + [(l-Li) (l-t)], Li)&#13;
where (1-Li) represents labor income in period i,(l-t) represents the payroll&#13;
taxes used to finance social insurance, and B, the pension benefits.&#13;
Feldstein shows that at the utility maximum,&#13;
dL&#13;
&gt; 0&#13;
dB&#13;
An increase in benefits leads to an increased demand for leisure (early&#13;
retirement). The sign of dS/dB, however is indeterminate. It is often&#13;
thought that poor or declining health is the primary cause of early retire-&#13;
ment 10/ -- and it is the health/declining capabilities argument which has&#13;
generally been behind the choice of the 65 retirement age wqhen the programs&#13;
are designed. However, once a long-term perspective is taken on this issue,&#13;
it becomes clear that poor health cannot account for the huge long-term&#13;
decline in the average retirement age since over time, health standards have&#13;
improved, rather than worsened. Thus, even in LDCs, where life-expectancies&#13;
are shorter and health standards pourer, the long- term decline in labor&#13;
force participation of older people cannot be explained this way. In short,&#13;
it is likely that social security factors (benefits, tax on post-retirement&#13;
earnings, etc.) account for much of this decline. 11/ If pension entitlement&#13;
reduces the average retirement age, it lengthens correspondingly the period&#13;
of retirement, and the number of years over which life cycle saving will have&#13;

to extend. The retiremenit decision As thus clearly endogenous to any model&#13;
purporting to describe the household allocation of consumption andT1 saving&#13;
over the life cycle.&#13;
Once this is recognized, the saving decision acquires a dual dimension.&#13;
Not only does the existence of social security (or private pension) retire-&#13;
ment income become a substitute for owTn savings for retirement, but it also&#13;
affects the choice of the retirement age, and thus the length of time one's&#13;
savings have to last0 These two effects offset each other, and the net&#13;
effect, which Cagan and Katona observed to be positive, need not always be&#13;
so. For example, for those who retire at the established retireerent age, and&#13;
who had always intended to do this in any case, there is no effect other than&#13;
that of asset substitution0 The retirement guidelines or age restrictions&#13;
coincide with the individual's choice, and therefore, do not affect it0 On&#13;
the other hand, for the individual whose retirement decision is influenced by&#13;
social security retirement income, and who because of this retires earlier&#13;
than he would otherwise have done, savings will increase0 The net result on&#13;
private savings remain arabiguous; it is not clear a prior which group&#13;
predominates, and consequently whether savings will be increased or decreased&#13;
for those who have guaranteed retirement incomes0&#13;
Feldstein's study (1.974a) concludes that the impact of social security&#13;
on household savings has been large and negative, and that the capital stock&#13;
of the US has been reduced substantially from what its value would otherwise&#13;
have been0 The results in fact are not entirely straight forward0 Social&#13;
security, whether measured as social security gross wealth, or net of the tax&#13;
liabilities which accompany the benefits, does have a negative effect on&#13;
savings in the period 1929-71, when an unemployment variable is excluded from&#13;
the regression equations0 When this variable is included, and for the&#13;
post-war period, regardless of the specification, no significant coefficient&#13;
attaches to either the social security gross or net variable. Other vari-&#13;
ables all have the expected signs and are significanto In short, Feldstein's&#13;
empirical results do not entirely clear up the indeterminacy of the theoreti-&#13;
cal propositiono 12/&#13;

Social Security Administration, mimeo, i980, casts some doubt on&#13;
Feldstein's US time series results0 Using a different algorithm for&#13;
constructing social security wealth, but replicating his equg.tions in&#13;
other respects, Leimer and Lesnoy find no case, either in the full&#13;
1924-1974 or the post-war 1947-74 period ir which the coefficient of&#13;
social security wealth (in a consumption function) is positive and sig-&#13;
nificant, indicating reduced savings0 The Leimer-Lesnoy results are&#13;
consistent with the Barro hypothesis (untested) that intergenerat'onal&#13;
transfers offset any potential effect of social security of savings0&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Munnell (1974b) extends the life cycle model along similar lines and&#13;
attempts to separate the impact of social security benefits on household&#13;
savings from the effects of early retirement, calling attention to the fact&#13;
that the age of retirement in the US has dropped considerably since 1935, the&#13;
year in which the social security system was introduced. In her model the&#13;
retirement decision is, therefore, not exogenous, as Katona and Cagan&#13;
implicitly assumed, but itself a function of the extent of social security&#13;
coverage. Munnell's equation estimates:&#13;
NN&#13;
S = a + b1 YDt + b2Wt + b3RU + b   SW  + b5YD +b6LF65&#13;
SST&#13;
where S represents household savings, YD, disposable income, RU, the&#13;
unemployment rate, SNW, SSW and SST, estimates of social security wealth and&#13;
LF65 is the labor force participation rate of men aged 65 and over. This&#13;
variable, if the induced retirement effect is correct, will be reduced by&#13;
social security coverage, thereby increasing savings of households.&#13;
In Munnell's results, none of the three social security variables nor&#13;
the LF65 variable are significant when the dependant variable is the&#13;
household savings series. When retirement savings 13/ are substituted for&#13;
total household savings, the effects of the social security variables and the&#13;
labor force participation rate both become highly significant in the&#13;
1900-1971 period of estimation. As in the Feldstein results, none of the&#13;
coefficients on the social security variables are significant in the post-war&#13;
period, although the labor force variable is significant in all periods in&#13;
the retirement savings equations.&#13;
In another study, Munnell (1974a) reestimated a subsample of Cagan's&#13;
1959 data from Consumer Reports subscribers. Correcting for factors such as&#13;
education, age, income, etc., and giving heavier weighting in the subsample&#13;
to individuals in their pre-retirement years, the study focused on that group&#13;
which, being close to retirement, would be most responsive in their savings&#13;
behaviour. Quite contrary to Cagan's findings, Munnell's results were con-&#13;
sonant with those predicted by the traditional life cycle model. The net&#13;
impact on savings was negative, and there was clear evidence of a substitu-&#13;
tion and an early retirement effect. Another study (1976) in wnich Munnell&#13;
analyzed private pension coverage for men aged 45-59, came to the same con-&#13;
clusion that pension coverage discourages savings in'other forms. The&#13;
13/ Retirement savings is a series constructed by Munnell which includes&#13;
increases in the assets of life insurance companies (net of loans to&#13;
policy holders) and private government retirement plans.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
analyzed private pension coverage for men aged 45-59, came to the same con-&#13;
clusion that pension coverage discourages savings in other forms. The&#13;
studies also indicate, indirectly, something about the length of time over&#13;
which individuals plan, since the substitution effect appears to be discern-&#13;
able only in the pre-retirement age groups.&#13;
The conclusion which can be drawn from these studies is that while there&#13;
does appear to be some evidence that social security does apppear to affect&#13;
savings for retirement, its effects on overall household savings remain&#13;
unproveno&#13;
A slightly different US time series study based on a _lfe cycle savings&#13;
function is Barro (1977,1978). Barro tests an equation very similar to&#13;
Feldstein's discussed earlier but including also, as variables, the govern-&#13;
ment budget surplus/deficit, the unemployment rate and the stock of durables&#13;
owned by households0 Barro does not disaggregate the substitution effect&#13;
from the effect of induced retirement0 His results differ from those of&#13;
Feldstein. In the post-war period the effects of social security on&#13;
household savi.ngs are not discernible0 (This parallels Feldstein's post-war&#13;
period results0) In the longer period, 1929-1974, the coefficient on the&#13;
social security gross wealth variable in the consumption function is positive&#13;
and is highly significant0 Barro concludes that there is no evidence to&#13;
support the hypothesis trhat the social security system has depressed private&#13;
savingso&#13;
The international and US cross section studies make up the remainder&#13;
of the empirical investigations based on the life cycle approacho The&#13;
studies by Feldstein (1974b) and (1976) estimate a life cycle savings func-&#13;
tion for a cross-section of 15 developed countries, showing the effects of&#13;
intercountry differences in social security provisions on retirement behavior&#13;
and on the savings rateo&#13;
This study differs from his earlier one in that it separates out the&#13;
retirement from the substitution effect, and that a "replacement ratio"&#13;
reflecting the extent to which benefits replace income lost due to retire-&#13;
ment, rather than social security wealth, is used0 Feldstein's own conclu-&#13;
sions confirm Munnell's findings about the importance of both the retirement&#13;
and benefit effects0 A one year decline in the retirement age was shownv to&#13;
increase savings by about 197% and an increase in the benefit level of 10%&#13;
reduced savings by 4.2 percentage points0&#13;
On closer scrutiny, however, Feldstein's equations can be interpreted to&#13;
support the "not conclusively proven" hypothesis0 While the induced retire-&#13;
ment effect always significantly reduces savings, the social security vari-&#13;
ables present a mixed bag of results, depending on the specification.&#13;
The final group of studies using the life cycle approach are those based&#13;
on household surveys, testing the micro responses to social security0&#13;
-24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pellochio's in example, estimates the response of household accumulation&#13;
of net worth to accumulated social security wealth, the implicit yield on&#13;
social security, the expected age of retirement and labor income.&#13;
Pellochio's results conform only in part to life cycle predictions.&#13;
Savings are negatively related to all variables but income. However, no&#13;
significant relation was found between the yield of the social security&#13;
system savings. The authors explain this result with the reasoning that&#13;
recipients are unable to foresee accurately the future benefits and hence do&#13;
not appreciate the yield on social security. Another interpretation could be&#13;
that the authors have mis-estimated the yield, and that recipients are indeed&#13;
predicting correctly rather lower yields than estimated by Pellochio, and not&#13;
adjusting their savings accordingly. This is the more likely explanation, in&#13;
view of the fact that the sample used in this study includes a large propor-&#13;
tion of higher income people for whom the rate of return on social security&#13;
benefits is likely to be extremely low, especially when future changes in the&#13;
system are considered.&#13;
There is another group of studies which do not approach the relationship&#13;
between social security and household savings via the life cycle theory.&#13;
Darby (1978) uses a permanent income savings function in which:&#13;
C=a + bIYP + b2YTt + b3M + b4Dt 1 + b5(PD/PND) + b6i + b7Ss&#13;
consumption is regressed against permanent income, transitory income, real&#13;
money balances, durable goods owned by households, the ratio of the prices of&#13;
consumer durable and non-durable goods, the interest rate and is alternative&#13;
types of social security variables including, social security gross and net&#13;
wealth, social security taxes and social security benefits times coverage.&#13;
Darby's results, covering a range of periods of estimation and&#13;
specifications, are a mixed bag. In the longer period, 1929-1974, social&#13;
security taxes and wealth are shown to have had a significant negative effect&#13;
on household savings, if Ml is used to represent real balances. When M2 is&#13;
used, the social security variables are not significant. They are also not&#13;
significant in the shorter, post-war period. Darby's own interpretation of&#13;
the results leans towards the suggestion that US time series data do not&#13;
conclusively support the view that social security has depressed household&#13;
savings.&#13;
Another recent study (IBRD 1976) of the implications of social security&#13;
in Malaysia, also quite out of the life-cycle vein, concludes that its&#13;
effects on individual savings behavior is minimal, precisely because&#13;
individuals are unable to see through the "veil" of the payroll tax. Thus,&#13;
rather than treating the compulsory levies as "savings", and changing their&#13;
behavior accordingly, they are seen by affiliates simply as a tax. The study&#13;
suggests that this observed behaviour may be a result of the newness of the&#13;
system. Since the system is still immature, and few have received benefits,&#13;
-25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
it may indeed require a leap of faith to recognize that benefits will be&#13;
forthcoming, and even more to anticipate them correctly. The "vei3." explana-&#13;
tion becomes less plausible with the maturing of the system, when its&#13;
benefits are visible and approximately known to most. Nonetheless, this may&#13;
take some time, with the result that over a period, no substitution effect is&#13;
discernable.&#13;
In an entirely new vein, a different and non-empirical, microeconomic&#13;
explanation of the relation between social security and private savings has&#13;
been put forward by Barro (1974)o Barro extends the usual life cycle utility&#13;
function&#13;
U = U(C1 , C2 000 Cn)&#13;
to embrace interdependence between the utility of parents and their children.&#13;
His adapted utility function is&#13;
U1 =u(c 11 C12 00O ClnD U2)&#13;
where in turn,&#13;
u2 = U(C2,1 C22 .00 C2nD U3)0&#13;
The subscripts refer to the generation and the period in which consumption&#13;
takes place, respectively0 Consumption is determined by the assets accumu-&#13;
lated while young, minus the bequest it is planned to leave to the subsequent&#13;
generation. In a pay-as-you go scheme, in which the older generation&#13;
receives benefits paid for by a tax levied on the younger generation, the&#13;
results are that when social security benefits are raised, (or, for the first&#13;
generation, introduced), the recipients, aware that this implies a burden --&#13;
higher taxes -- on the younger subsequent generation, will attempt to make&#13;
good by increasing the size of the bequest they leave to the younger gener-&#13;
ation. That is, they will reduce consumption0    This sort of approacn seems&#13;
implausible for two reasons0 Firstly, it is not clear that on average,&#13;
people do plan to leave bequests0 Secondly, even if utility functions are&#13;
interdependent, it is very likely that the utility from an additional unit of&#13;
parents' own consumption will be more than the indirect utility which they&#13;
derive from knowing that their childrens' consumption is increased v:.a their&#13;
bequest0 In fact, where technical progress increases quickly the living&#13;
standard between generations, the Barro approach may give the reverso conclu-&#13;
sion, since the rational parent may decrease his bequest, klnowing that even&#13;
without it, his children's consumption will be very'much higher than his own,&#13;
and the marginal utility from any bequest considerably smaller0 Finally, the&#13;
degree of planning, foresight and means required are unlikely to be found in&#13;
the average saver although Barro argues that this does not systematically&#13;
bias his results0&#13;
Finally, for Barro's results to obtain, it is necessary that the social&#13;
security scheme eventually be liquidated; if it is not, a pay-as-you go&#13;
-26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social security scheme remains akin to a Ponzi scheme: There is no ultimate&#13;
liability to subsequent generations, and hence, no need for offsetting&#13;
bequests which reduce consumption.&#13;
Feldstein and Pellochio (1977) test Barro's hypothesis using a hybrid&#13;
savings equation with household survey data. The equation estimates wealth,&#13;
the product of household savings, as a function of social security wealth is&#13;
net of tax labor income in pre-retirement years. The results obtained from&#13;
this specification show a negative and significant coefficient on Social&#13;
Security Wealth, but there is no evidence of complete one for one substitu-&#13;
tion between social security wealth and household fungible wealth accumula-&#13;
tion. Because the specification does not separate the two effects, it is not&#13;
really very helpful in elucidating Barro's hypothesis.&#13;
In sum, both from the theoretical and the empirical point of view, the&#13;
evidence regarding the effect of social insurance on personal savings is not&#13;
entirely conclusive. The life cycle framework, which appears to provide a&#13;
singularly appropriate means of studying the effects of guaranteed retirement&#13;
benefits, confirms a negative effect over certain periods of estimation, but&#13;
cannot confirm it in others. However, as to the magnitude of the effect,&#13;
there is little consensus. Other studies, however, suggest that the direc-&#13;
tion may be positive, either because individuals see the social security&#13;
levies as a tax, or because future benefits are so far beyond their planning&#13;
horizon that their present savings behavior remains unaffected.&#13;
The savings issue is a difficult one to test for a number of reasons.&#13;
First, there are conceptual problems in specifying the equation. This is&#13;
clear from the wealth of different theories on the subject and the many&#13;
varied empirical approaches described in this brief review.&#13;
Second, there are conceptual problems in the measurement of savings and&#13;
of wealth, and also in the measurement of other variables, especially social&#13;
security wealth, future benefits and the yield on social security. The&#13;
difficulty with the social security variables are that the present benefit&#13;
structure is taken as given, and projected to continue through the future.&#13;
Such an assumption certainly is not appropriate for the US, on which most of&#13;
these studies focus, where present financing for the social security system&#13;
is known to be inadequate and the likelihood of changes in benefits or taxes&#13;
-- and hence social security wealth or yield -- very high. These are also&#13;
data difficulties in the measurement of savings -- usually estimated as a&#13;
residual -- which make the estimation of the relationship betwen social&#13;
security and household savings somewhat suspect.&#13;
Social Insurance and Government Savings&#13;
Another side of this question is the effect of social insurance on&#13;
government saving. One study (Reviglio, 1967) focuses on the tax aspects on&#13;
the system alone, testing the relationship between social insurance taxes and&#13;
-27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
total government revenues in a cross-section study of countries. The ques-&#13;
tion is whether payroll taxes are an addition to "normal"g government tax&#13;
collections, or a substitute for some types of taxes, impairing the govern-&#13;
ment's ability to levy these taxes. The latter is what a taxable capacity&#13;
model would suggest.&#13;
Reviglio tests an equation in a cross section of 64 developed and&#13;
developing countries in which per capita central government direct tax&#13;
revenues is regressed on per capita revenues from social insurance payroll&#13;
taxes, and per capita personal income. A negative coefficient on social&#13;
security revenues would suggest that payroll taxes do impair the government's&#13;
ability to raise direct taxes0&#13;
In any case, the latter part of the argument is entirely separate from&#13;
the first, and need not follow at all0 Higher government revenues may imply&#13;
higher government expenditures 14/ rather than a higher level of government&#13;
saving0&#13;
Reviglio's results suggest that payroll taxes may be viewed di'fferently&#13;
from other taxes by taxpayers0 His estimates show that they provide a net&#13;
addition to government revenues, and do not significantly impair the govern-&#13;
ment's tax levying ability0 If this is indeed so, the contention that the&#13;
choice of the payroll tax as a means of financing social security benefits&#13;
reduces public savings by reducing the potential size of government surplus&#13;
loses its force0 If payroll taxes and other direct taxes are complements,&#13;
there should be no negative impact on the level of government reverues0&#13;
There is, however, a technical sense, as contrasted with the political&#13;
one, in which payroll taxes may reduce government revenues0 This is simply&#13;
that the deductibility of employer contributions reduces the net revenues&#13;
from the corporate income tax and that this deficiency may not be made up&#13;
elsewhere0 Nonetheless, in either case, political or technical, there is no&#13;
evidence that the government's marginal propensity to save is any greater&#13;
than the private propensity (Lotz and Morss, 1968) and that higher tax&#13;
revenues would have implied higher public sector savings.&#13;
All of the above assumes a strictly contributory system of socipl&#13;
insurance in which the government's contribution to the system9 if any, is&#13;
qua employer only0 Once the government begins to subsidize the sociel&#13;
insurance program, a different analysis is called for, In some socili&#13;
insurance systems, government subsidies to the social insurance systr-m are&#13;
very large0 In Chile, for example, approximately 30% of out-payment,i are&#13;
made possible only by a deficit in another set of government accounts.&#13;
Deficit financed subsidies to the system represent government dissav!ng. To&#13;
evaluate the net savings mobilized by the social security system, it is the&#13;
cash surplus net of any public subsidies which is relevant0&#13;

Chapter III&#13;
The Evolution of Social Security and the Development of the Chilean System&#13;
Social security has become a feature of most economies, both developed&#13;
and underdeveloped. Few countries fail to provide some type of benefit, to&#13;
some group of employees. The nature and extent of protection offered is,&#13;
however, wide ranging, and the phrase "social security" alone explains very&#13;
little. Social security systems can take a number of forms, ranging from&#13;
outright paternalism on the part of the employer, whether by custom or by&#13;
law, to the "cradle to grave" social assistance protection, characterized by&#13;
increasing coverage, cost, and public reponsibility, typical of many European&#13;
economies. Most social security systems lie somewhere in between these two&#13;
extremes.&#13;
There does not appear to be a strong relation between a country's level&#13;
of development and the extensiveness of its social protection sector. 1/ Some&#13;
of the richest developed countries have social programs which by relative&#13;
standards could be considered parismonious; and there are less developed&#13;
countries in which the social security system is broad and wide ranging.&#13;
While there is no evolutionary pattern relating national wealth to&#13;
social insurance, the age of the system does play an important role, 2/&#13;
because the development of most national social security programs follows a&#13;
fairly typical pattern. This pattern can be observed in the cross-section of&#13;
schemes of different ages extant in various countries today.&#13;
Historically, the first stage in man's search for security and protec-&#13;
tion from risks was the mutual-aid society which developed out of the&#13;
European guild system of the middle ages. Mutual societies were based on&#13;
social and moral conventions and the fairly obvious advantages of&#13;
risk-pooling provided the cohesiveness of the group. The "benefits" provided&#13;
by these brotherhoods were essentially necessary charity, such as support for&#13;
guild-members and families in the event of death or injury. Sometime in the&#13;
nineteenth century, the concept of work-related risks was recognized and,&#13;
1/  See Aaron, H., "Social Security: International Comparisons," in&#13;
0. Eckstein, ed; Studies in the Economics of Income Maintenance. Brook-&#13;
ings Instition, 1967, Washington, DC. Aaron found that the percentage of&#13;
national income that is spent on social security is not significantly&#13;
related to per capita income.&#13;
2/ See Aaron, op. cit; The age of the social insurance system was the single&#13;
most important variable explaining the fraction of national income spent&#13;
on social insurance.&#13;
-29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
through the guilds, which had by this time developed more into syndical&#13;
organizations, attention was focused on the need for the preservation of&#13;
workers' health, workers' only capital0&#13;
In terms of the evolution of present day systems, typically the first&#13;
type of benefit provided through a social insurance program is workmens'&#13;
compensation. It ranks high on the scale of desired benefits and is not&#13;
expensive to provide. The concepts of of other types of risk       unemploy-&#13;
ment, disability, old age and the protection to go along with them - and&#13;
then finally extension to the family nucleus, historically, and in the pat-&#13;
tern of evolution is still a ways off0&#13;
By the middle of the nineteenth century, syndical organizations, which&#13;
were then still independent entities governed from within, attracted the&#13;
attention of the State0   With the development of an industrial, urbanized,&#13;
and wage dependent society, the importance of risk of illness or incapacity&#13;
was increasing, and in Germany, in 1839, the first laws giving employers&#13;
certain responsibilities in the case of on-the-job accidents was passed0 In&#13;
1856, in Prussia, worker-affiliation with their respective trade mutual&#13;
societies was made obligatory, and subsequently employers were also required&#13;
to assist the mutual societies financially0&#13;
The partial and voluntary nature of the work-related injury assistance&#13;
was transformed into a mandatory system in 1881 in Germany, through legisla-&#13;
tion promulgated by Bismark0 Shortly thereafter, in 1883 and 1889, the first&#13;
true social security laws came into existence, including protection for&#13;
illness, work-related injury, disability, death and old-age. Costs were&#13;
shared by employees and employers0&#13;
In the United Kingdom, the "9Friendly Societies" played the same role&#13;
as the guilds of continental Europeo 1908 marked the date of the introduc-&#13;
tion of a national pension system, and 1911, of the National Insurance Act&#13;
for protection against sickness and disability0 The United States was a&#13;
relative late comer to the group0 The Social Security Act was introduced in&#13;
1935. The US also differs from the above pattern in that unions did not&#13;
provide the force behind the social security involvement, but were in fact&#13;
quite opposed to it0   It took the Great Depression to indicate that private&#13;
arrangements were inadequate in some circumstances and government the only&#13;
body with the means to provide protection on the scale requiredo&#13;
This traces the concept of social security from its inception as a&#13;
voluntary fraternal- or mutual-aid society, emphasizing work-injury, to the&#13;
point at which the government formally recognizes the existence of risk and&#13;
the need for protection0 The social insurance system which then develops&#13;
depends on whether the government begins by legitimizing existing organiza-&#13;
tions and carrying over the benefits to the, in general, small number of&#13;
affiliates, or introduces a new national level system of its own, in which&#13;
case affiliation is likely to be much larger, but the benefits less broad,&#13;
due to the high costo Ultimately, the former benefit-intensive programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expand their coverage, and the latter programs grow to provide increasing&#13;
benefits to the population, so that finally which ever route is taken, the&#13;
result is the same. In this final stage typically the family, much more than&#13;
just the worker, becomes the focus of attention. Other things change too.&#13;
Income maintenance programs frequently become income redistribution programs,&#13;
full health care for workers and non-workers alike may be introduced, 3/ and&#13;
family allowances,which have little to do with income maintenance, provide&#13;
supplementary income for family members. Table III.1 indicates how this&#13;
progression has taken place since the 1940's.&#13;

As the historical evolution would suggest, by far and away the most&#13;
common form of social insurance is a program providing work-injury benefits.&#13;
Most of the countries having any type of program have work injury. As the&#13;
historical evolution also suggests, the second most common insurance program&#13;
is the pension scheme. By 1973, of the 127 countries with some type of&#13;
scheme, 82% had old age and survivors' insurance. By contrast, only half as&#13;
many (55%) provided sickness and maternity insurance and only 34% covered&#13;
unemployment. Family allowances were practically non-existent in 1940, but&#13;
have developed rapidly since then, and are provided in over half (52%) of&#13;
countries with social security programs.&#13;
The other aspect of social security evolution mentioned earlier is the&#13;
growth of coverage. Most typically, systems start small, both in terms of&#13;
scope, as the previous table indicated, and in terms of coverage. Because&#13;
they frequently develop out of union or industrial precursers, nascent sys-&#13;
tems initially cover little more than the most organized of the worker&#13;
groups. Members of the armed forces, civil service and other public&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
employees are almost always the first to secure coverage under public sys-&#13;
tems; then members of the most powerful labour groups, such as the railways,&#13;
and the banking sector. Blue-collar members are among the last groups to be&#13;
affiliated, along with the self-employed. 4/ Very few countries - such as&#13;
the US and Switzerland, have bypassed this process, and introduced a unified&#13;
national system at a stroke. 5/ Table IIIo2 shows the coverage of social&#13;
security systems in selected developed and underdeveloped countries, ranked&#13;
by age of the system.&#13;
The older systems in Latin America, the Chilean, the Argentine and the&#13;
Uruguayan have the most extensive coverage with over 50% of the labor force&#13;
covered. The coverage in those countries in which programs were introduced&#13;
in or after the 1940's is generally much narrower0 The exceptions to this&#13;
are Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore - young schemes in which 40%, 52% and&#13;
72% of the working population is covered0 The latter countries, however,&#13;
have a provident fund, rather than pension system for insurance against old&#13;
age, invalidity and death through which higher levels of coverage can be&#13;
achieved at lesser cost0 The Sri Lankan coverage is exceptional and can be&#13;
explained by that government's social orientation and focus on basic needs&#13;
throughout their public expenditure program0 These exceptions notw:ithstand-&#13;
ing, tables IIIo1 and IIIo2 support Aaron's notion that the age of a social&#13;
security system is an important determinant of its extension and scope0&#13;
The two typical patterns of development through which social insurance&#13;
systems reach their final shape, extensive and intensive growth, have already&#13;
been noted and depend on the governments' approach to existing informal&#13;
worker arrangements0 This intensive versus extensive development can also be&#13;
characterized as "people- or program-orientation".0 For a given level of&#13;
expenditure, there is a tradeoff between better quality coverage and a larger&#13;
number of people covered; a fledgeling system can either increase its&#13;
geographic coverage, or broaden the range of benefits to a select group0&#13;
The following diagram Illustrates this tradeoff0&#13;
4/ Differences in coverage may also occur due to ethnic or racial differen-&#13;
ces, especially in Africa0 In Southern Rhodesia, the indigenous popula-&#13;
tion is covered only for employment injury, and in South Africa, African&#13;
and Asian workers are excluded from family benefits, and pensions and are&#13;
paid according to ethnic origin0&#13;

The vertical axis represents the extent of coveragid the horizontal axis,&#13;
the index of benefit quality, oI some other indicator of the scope of the&#13;
program. The lines AA, and A A indicate the tradeoff between the use of a&#13;
given level of resources for broadening coverage or adding new benefits0 The&#13;
slope of the lines will depend on the specific relative costs in each system.&#13;
As decisions are made for various reasons to devote more resources to social&#13;
insurance, the iso-cost curves shift outward and eventually both benefits and&#13;
coverage become comprehensive. At the outset, however, increased coverage&#13;
comes at the expense of depth in benefits for any given level of outlayso&#13;
Examples of both the extensive and intensive models can be found in&#13;
Latin America, whose social insurance programs basically fall into two&#13;
categories1, those erring by commission and those which err by way of omis-&#13;
siono Some appear very generous in terms of coverage and benefits for the&#13;
country's level of development; others are characterized by very restricted&#13;
programs and affiliation0 Countries with the oldest programs, such as Argen-&#13;
tina, Uruguay and Chile, the "southern cone"1 countries of Latin America, fall&#13;
into the former categoryo Although at this time coverage is both broad and&#13;
deep, these countries originally took the extensive route, providing broad&#13;
coverage to many groups, with the depth of the program, and wider-ranging&#13;
protection coming later0 That the extent and coverage of social security&#13;
provisions in these countries is far greater than the embodied in the United&#13;
States' legislation (and that the programs were introduced almost two decades&#13;
earlier) is often surprising to many first-time students of the subject who&#13;
expect systems of such scope to be characteristic only of countries far more&#13;
developed0&#13;
A larger number of countries have followed the alternate intensive&#13;
route0 The Andean countries are characterized by a relatively move unequal&#13;
distribution of income, and have far higher population growth rates0 Their&#13;
programs tend to be restricted to homogeneous groups and have nar-cw&#13;
geographic coverage0 However, what is provided to this small group is fairly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
deep in scope. For example, coverage in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Mexico&#13;
extends to only about 14-19% of the labor force, but pensions, sickness and&#13;
maternity and work injury are all provided. In addition, Ecuador covers&#13;
unemployment; and in Mexico and Costa Rica, family allowances are provided.&#13;
The few benefits extended to the population at large are thin in conception,&#13;
the range of services is narrow and poorly financed.&#13;
Similar examples can be found amongst Asian countries. Most have chosen&#13;
the extensive route with limited benefits to a fairly large number of people.&#13;
The schemes in Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka, for example, all cover&#13;
private sector employees through compulsory affiliation with limited old age&#13;
insurance programs provided through provident funds.&#13;
In Africa, social security has broadly speaking gone the intensive&#13;
route, i.e., special schemes for public employees which include sickness, old&#13;
age and death, health insurance and family allowances, with limited coverage&#13;
for the remaining employees who are covered by a system. 6/ This is in part&#13;
due to low population densities of these land surplus economies and their&#13;
economic structure (non-wage) which makes it difficult to provide access to&#13;
benefits in large parts of the country.&#13;
In table III.3 these differences in coverage are highlighted by means&#13;
of the variations in social security expenditures as a fraction of GNP. This&#13;
ratio, while not a perfect proxy for coverage, is correlated with it. In&#13;
general, intensive systems, even if a number of benefits are provided, are&#13;
far less costly than even thin extensive systems providing some benefit to a&#13;
broad section of the population.&#13;
While some caution must be exercised with these comparative figures&#13;
since the programs may include benefits of differing types and varying&#13;
coverages, table III.3 nonetheless does provide a perspective on the level of&#13;
expenditures on social insurance in these countries. Clearly the European&#13;
and North American countries in which social security has developed into&#13;
social assistance show the highest levels of expenditure. Latin America,&#13;
with the preponderance of older schemes, many of which are also quite broad,&#13;
follows suit. Expenditures on social security programs in Chile amount to&#13;
some 16-17% of GDP. A social welfare program with the depth as that of Chile&#13;
does not come cheaply. This is greater than the equivalent proportions in&#13;
the United States, Israel, Canada and the UK, and on a par with Germany.&#13;
Chile is, on the other hand, outspent by Sweden, Italy, Belgium and the&#13;
Netherlands. The Asian extensive systems are slightly more expensive, as a&#13;
percentage of GNP, than the generally more specialized African systems.&#13;

The other side of the coin is represented by the resources required to&#13;
pay for the benefits provided. Almost without exception, the self-help&#13;
origins of social security in the guild system have been carried forward to&#13;
the present and are evident in the use of payroll taxes on affiliates them-&#13;
selves to support the systems. Similarly, the employer portion of the&#13;
payroll tax has its origins in the responsibility of the employer for work&#13;
injury. There are cases, usually in those countries in which social security&#13;
coverage and benefits have become very broad, in which the program is&#13;
financed through general revenues. This generally happens when the program&#13;
becomes so costly that it becomes politically unacceptable to finance it&#13;
through a payroll tax because of the highly visible nature of the transfers,&#13;
or when the beneficiary population approaches 100% of the population. There&#13;
is little reason, other than tradition and the historical origins, to finance&#13;
the programs through payroll taxes when full coverage is achieved. It is&#13;
only when the coverage of a program is limited that there would be some&#13;
injustice in using general revenues to finance a program of benefits which&#13;
are available to few.&#13;
Table III.4 shows the range of tax rates levied in different countries.&#13;
Payroll taxes in Chile are amongst the highest shown in the table -- a com-&#13;
bined employer and employee rate of close to 50%. Only the European "welfare&#13;
states" -- Belgium, France and Italy -- have charges this high. Far more&#13;
typical are rates of 10-15% for the more limited benefit programs in Mexico,&#13;
the Philippines and Malaysia.&#13;

The Historical Context: Social Insurance in Chile&#13;
The development of the Chilean social security system follows the pat-&#13;
tern described in the previous pages closely, beginning with work-injury&#13;
insurance as the first benefit. The growth of social insurance provisions&#13;
followed the extensive pattern common to many countries in which limited&#13;
benefits are provided to large numbers, although the system's rapid growth&#13;
(the shifting outward of the iso-cost curves), sometimes makes it difficult&#13;
to classify. The system began narrowly with the creation of a pencion scheme&#13;
for the Army in 1915. The employees of the State Railway (Ferrocarriles del&#13;
Estado) were incorporated in 1918, and shortly thereafter, the remainder of&#13;
the public sector followed suit. All three funds were conceived initially&#13;
only to provide pension benefits rather than welfare services such as family&#13;
allowances or medical care, and financing was rooted firmly in the principles&#13;
of the self-help contributory model. The introduction of further benefits to&#13;
protect against other contingencies did not take place until well after other&#13;
employees were provided for. 8/ Soon thereafter, in 1924, the blue collar&#13;
labor force was integrated into the social security system, with the creation&#13;
of the "Caja de Seguro Obligatorio" (later renamed the "Servicio de Seguridad&#13;
Social"), and the "Caja de Empleados Particulares" was established to protect&#13;
private sector white collar employees0 Between 1925 and 1945, the system&#13;
also expanded intensively with the provision of further benefits to&#13;
affiliates0 9/&#13;
While the Chilean system fits many of the characteristics of the typol-&#13;
ogy presented earlier, it is also unusual in many respects0 The present day&#13;
distinguishing anomaly of the Chilean social insurance system is t'ne fact&#13;
that it is not, indeed a "system" at all, but rather an array of individual&#13;
institutions (35 at present) each with its own distinct regime of coverage,&#13;
benefits and contribution rates0 Each of these institutions purports to&#13;
represent a specific sector of the populace and to be attuned to and to serve&#13;
its needs and requirementso Thus, there are funds for blue- and white-collar&#13;
employees, for bank employees, for shipping employees, employees of gas&#13;
companies, water companies, municipalities, sporting clubs and racetracks.&#13;
Administratively, these funds are in no manner related0&#13;
Among the most interesting and perhaps instructive aspects of the&#13;
Chilean system is an analysis of the evolution of the system to its present-&#13;
day formo Most of the employee groups presently covered by the smaller&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
specialized funds mentioned above came originally under the jurisdiction of&#13;
the larger institutions for public and private employees and workers. 10/&#13;
Under the extensive route by which social security developed, identical&#13;
benefits would have been provided to the very heterogeneous groups of poten-&#13;
tial members. Dissatisfaction with the limited benefit package, especially&#13;
among the better off employee groups (which was later exacerbated as the&#13;
benefit structure increasingly emphasized redistribution in favor of the&#13;
lower paid groups who made up the bulk of the cajas' membership) caused many&#13;
better-off employee groups, instead of affiliating with the larger systems,&#13;
to withdraw to set up their own funds. These smaller funds, by providing a&#13;
different package of benefits and catering to a small, homogeneous group and,&#13;
most importantly, thereby limiting redistribution, were able to offer (and&#13;
still do offer) a much wider range of benefits and services than can be&#13;
offered by the institutions serving the country's working class. The sub-&#13;
divisions of the larger cajas into optimal "clubs" left the blue collar&#13;
institutions at a disadvantage. Their financial solvency was jeopardized and&#13;
the services they provided were increasingly restricted. This process of&#13;
opting out, the danger it involves and features which make for similar pres-&#13;
sures on other systems are discussed later in this chapter.&#13;
The Chilean System: Present Strucutre&#13;
The three earliest and largest semi-fiscal institutions still dominate&#13;
the picture in Chile; together they insure about 70% of the total labor&#13;
force, and approximately 90% of the labour force affiliated to any institu-&#13;
tion at all is affiliated to one of these three. Between these three and the&#13;
next largest there is a quantum leap. As the table below shows, the fourth&#13;
largest fund (Armed Forces) covers only 2.1% of the total affiliated popula-&#13;
tion, the fifth, 1.4%. Ninety-seven percent of all contributing workers&#13;
belong to the largest blue collar institution, the "Servicio de Seguridad&#13;
Social" (SSS, herceforth). The fund for private sector employees (EMPART)&#13;
extends coverage to approximately 85% of the total affiliated white collar&#13;
labour force in private industry. Sixty-five percent of covered public&#13;
employeees are members of the "Caja de Empleados Publicos" (CANAEMPU). The&#13;
benefits extended by the three funds to contributing and retired members and&#13;
their dependents, reach about 73% of the total population. 11/ At the very&#13;
bottom of the range are the funds with some few hundred members. These are&#13;
the small, privileged private funds, such as the Bank Funds and the Racetrack&#13;
Employees' Funds, whose affiliates comprise a select, homogeneous group.&#13;
These differ from the broader institutions not only by thie nature of their&#13;
membership, but by the nature of their revenues. While the semi-fiscal funds&#13;
10/ The Banking Funds, Gildemeister, and other private corporate pension&#13;
funds are an exception in that they existed before the social security&#13;
system was set up in 1925.&#13;

are supported solely via payroll levies, 12/ the private funds also receive&#13;
revenues from various federal excise taxes which are earmarked for them.&#13;
Nature of the Benefits&#13;
The Chilean social insurance system covers primarily dependent&#13;
employees. The self-employed, including those having their own professional&#13;
societies (doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc.) are generally not covered&#13;
although they are eligible for affiliation as independents. Within the class&#13;
of dependent employees, a distinction has always been made in Chile between&#13;
"obreros" or wage/blue collar labor, and "asalariados", white collar&#13;
employees on a salary, however meager this may be. This distinction has been&#13;
carried over into the types of social insurance provision available to them,&#13;
as the previous table shows. There are frequently two funds for the same&#13;
employee sector; for example the Municipal Workers' Fund, and Municipal&#13;
Employees' Fund. The two groups receive different levels of benefits (which&#13;
is in the nature of things as many benefits are related to past earnings&#13;
levels) and also distinct kinds of benefits. Eligibility requirements for&#13;
the various benefits also differ amongst the funds. These are usually much&#13;
stricter for the larger funds, especially the Servicio de Seguro Social,&#13;
which has almost always operated under financial constraints, due in large&#13;
measure to the splintering of the better-off employees groups to form their&#13;
own Cajas. The following table indicates the nature of the benefits extended&#13;
to the three primary employee groups. Though not shown in the table, the&#13;
nonfiscal institutions generally provide the same range of benefits as does&#13;
the public employees fund, CANAEMPU.&#13;
12/ Recently many of them have also been receiving subsidies from the&#13;
central government.&#13;

The range of benefits authorized by the different regimes indIcates a&#13;
profound discrimination amongst the social groups, which is essentially what&#13;
the membership in these three funds corresponds to. Public employees are by&#13;
far the most favoured group, receiving life insurante and provided for in the&#13;
event of unemployment. Blue collar workers are not offered either of these&#13;
benefits, nor are they eligible for retirement aftere "years of serv.Â°ce", ioe.&#13;
for a seniority pension. This latter kind of pension, as we shall see sub-&#13;
sequently, has encouraged the early retirement amongst the professional&#13;
-42 &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
classes. 13/ The scarcity of administrative and technical manpower in Chile&#13;
makes this quite a serious problem. As regards the other types of pension,&#13;
such as those received by family members in the event of the death of the&#13;
worker-affiliate, the public employees fund is again the most liberal. All&#13;
dependents at time of death, (including brothers) are eligible for support.&#13;
All three institutions provide family allowances to their members.&#13;
However, until recently there were differences among the institutions, arose&#13;
primarily from the number of beneficiaries eligible for the allowances and&#13;
the size of the allowance itself. 14/&#13;
Health care is also provided in some manner by the three funds. For&#13;
SSS members, it is provided in kind, through the Servicio Nacional de Salud.&#13;
The quality of care is generally good in urban areas, but its distribution is&#13;
poor, and rural affiliates often do not have access to the health service&#13;
clinics.&#13;
Eligibility for Benefits&#13;
The overview of the social security benefits extended to the varous&#13;
groups holding membership in the funds exposes a number of inequities of the&#13;
system. Discrimination of an equally fundamental nature is also inherent in&#13;
the eligibility requirements for many benefits and often remains disguised.&#13;
There are two broad categories of benefits for which eligibility requirements&#13;
are important: the entire pension system and the system of family allowances.&#13;
Pension eligLbility may be determined by (1) age, (2) years of service, or&#13;
(3) post-retirement income, and (4) for disability pensions, the degree of&#13;
disability. Eligibility for family allowances, until the recent reform,&#13;
varied with respect to the family members defined as dependents, and with&#13;
respect to an income ceiling on the dependents' earnings. The following&#13;
table indicates the eligibility requirements for different types of pension:&#13;
13/ See Davis, (1964).&#13;
14/ Until 1974. In that year, the Consolidated Fund of Family Allowances&#13;
(Fondo Unico de Asignaciones Familiares) was created, which equalized&#13;
family allowances across all institutions.&#13;

Clearly there is much discriminatIon between the groups arising from&#13;
these variable eligibility requirements. Breaches of vertical equity arise&#13;
in numerous ways. The required period of contribution for retirement pen-&#13;
sions range from 1 (EMPART) to 15 (SSS) years. With respect to senIority&#13;
pensions, the range of necessary years of affiliation is 25-35, and the&#13;
minimum age goes from 45-55. For the blue collar class, it is 65, since they&#13;
are not allowed early retirement pensions0&#13;
-44 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These features are very important for the net incidence of social&#13;
insurance programs. The shorter the period of affiliation, the lower will be&#13;
an individual's accumulated paid-in contributions at the time of retirement.&#13;
The result is that those with shorter periods of affiliation have "paid" less&#13;
for a given level of retirement benefits than others whose affiliation was of&#13;
longer duration.&#13;
A feature which puts many members of the blue collar class who would&#13;
otherwise be covered on the margin of social security is the existence of&#13;
concurrent requirements. Social security members are required to fulfill&#13;
(1) a minimum number of years of contributions, (2) a minimum density of&#13;
contributions (years of contributions divided by years of affiliation), 15/&#13;
and (3) minimum age requirements. In practice, owing to cultural and&#13;
socioeconomic factors, this group fulfills such requirements with difficulty.&#13;
An indication of the number of insured at the margin of protection, is given&#13;
by the fact that in 1965, compared to the 15,437 pensions that were granted&#13;
by the SSS, 7,963 requests, or half as many, were turned down. Of these&#13;
rejected applicants, 6,500 fulfilled the requirements of the EMPART for&#13;
retirment on the same grounds of old age. 16/ The system of family allowan-&#13;
ces, exhibited many of the same features so evident in the pension system,&#13;
and could be likewise faulted for the discrimination inherent in the way&#13;
benefits are distributed. Unlike a generalized welfare system where such&#13;
allowances are generally means-tested so that the recipient's state of need&#13;
determines the level of benefits, until the 1974 reforms, the funds in Chile&#13;
each administered their own family allowances, and there was no overall&#13;
progressive redistributive element. Over the system as a whole, these&#13;
allowances were positively related to income: The allowance for Banco de&#13;
Chile employees was five times that of a person affiliated with SSS as table&#13;
III.8 shows.&#13;
15/ Thus, a worker fulfilling the 800 weeks of contributions requirement, if&#13;
he has been affiliated to the SSS caja for 40 years, may not in fact&#13;
fulfill the simultaneous density requirement namely 1040 (20 yrs x 52)&#13;
weeks of paid contributions.&#13;

The equalization of family allowances had led to significant gains in&#13;
the real value of blue-collar workers' receipts relative to those of the&#13;
non-manual class. In absolute terms, the allowances are below the peaks they&#13;
reached in the early 1970's during the Popular Unity Government, but they are&#13;
well above the level of allowances in the 1960's. For the white collar class&#13;
the decline has generally been quite large.&#13;
Another important difference between the institutions was the number&#13;
of dependents eligible for allowances: for publlc sector employees prior to&#13;
1974, all legitimate descendants, forebears, and natural children were&#13;
eligible.&#13;

The greatest practical difference perhaps between the blue and white&#13;
collar funds was the provision of family allowances to natural children in&#13;
the latter. For sociological reasons, the incidence of this is likely to be&#13;
much higher among the worker class. Hence, this particular exclusion was&#13;
likely to weigh heavily against the worker class. The exclusion of parents&#13;
too, generated vertical inequity. Especially where pensions are inadequate&#13;
and eligiblity requirements difficult to fulfill, the affiliated worker is&#13;
likely to have a dependent parent. It is in this class where the extended&#13;
family system is still strong (precisely because the transition from retire-&#13;
ment provision via intergenerational transfer has not been completed), where&#13;
there is likely to be a greater need for relief on this score than in the&#13;
other institutions. The inequities arising out of differential eligibility&#13;
for family allowances have all been eliminated by the 1974 reforms.&#13;
The final eligibility-related inequity arises from differences in the&#13;
concept of "disability". For SSS affiliates, this must be "absolute" for&#13;
receipt of a pension; lesser degrees are required of the affiliates of EMPART&#13;
and CANAEMPU.&#13;
Level of Benefits&#13;
Because, in general, pension benefits are fairly directly related to&#13;
past earning levels, it Ls in the nature of things that within each fund,&#13;
there be no overt distributional implications. (These were eliminated by the&#13;

initial formation of the cajas.) However, taking the three funds together, a&#13;
different picture emerges, and the benefit structure becomes regressive.&#13;
This is the result of four things: the proportion of the salary which is&#13;
replaced by the pension (replacement ratio), the actual base salary on which&#13;
the pension is based (i.e., average of last three years or five years'&#13;
salary, etc.), the different timing and extent of the pension revaluations&#13;
made for inflation and the ceiling, if any, imposed or post-retirement earn-&#13;
ings, that is, the effective marginal tax rate on retirement income.&#13;
Table III.10 shows the immense variability of the pension benefits&#13;
received by affiliates of the various institutions. Pensions range from 50%&#13;
of the monthly wage to up to 133% of the past salary (for a public employee&#13;
with 40 years affiliation).&#13;
Pensions of the SSS are adjusted annually by the amount of the average&#13;
wage increase of this group, if it exceeds 15% over the past year. With&#13;
respect to the entire system of adjustments, this is the only one which is&#13;
not directly related to variations in the price index. 17/ Adjustments for&#13;
EMPART affiliates are also made annually, (if the "sueldo vital", directly&#13;
linked with prices, has risen by over 10%). Pensions are adjusted by between&#13;
0 and 100 percent, depending on the size of the pension.&#13;
A special subgroup of EMPART affiliates is entitled to the so-called&#13;
"pensiones perseguidores". That is, pensions are indexed to some percentage&#13;
of the salary increases of the corresponding employee in active service.&#13;
Because of trends in public sector remuneration over the past two decades,&#13;
this arrangement results in a greater adjustment of pensions for this group&#13;
of retirees than for any other.&#13;
Those institutions in which have no indexing provisions for pensions 18/&#13;
follow guidelines set up in the Pension Revaluation Fund (Fondo de&#13;
Revalorizacion de Pensiones). These are broadly similar to the provisions&#13;
for EMPART retirees.&#13;
In terms of the proportion of total costs which go to each of these&#13;
types of expenditure, pension disbursements are by far the largest category&#13;
of expenditure, and the proportion has increased sharply since 1960. The&#13;
expenditure levels are shown in table III.11.&#13;

While the former has more than doubled in 15 years, the latter has risen by&#13;
less than a quarter. This is due to a mixture of early-retirement among&#13;
those who are affiliated, and to a base of affiliates which is not growing&#13;
as rapidly as the labor force in general.&#13;
The sizable proportion of resources directed towards erstwhile&#13;
members of the labor force has implied a consequent decline in the&#13;
disbursements on family allowances and health care. Given the age&#13;
structure of the population, it is likely that pension will continue to&#13;
be the most costly aspect of the social insurance system.&#13;

The Chilean system is financed in the so-called tripartite manner.&#13;
The income derives from contributions from affiliated members, their&#13;
employers and from the state. This is in direct contrast to the US and&#13;
many other systems where the pension portion of the social security system&#13;
is entirely contributory . In the system of tripartite financing, the&#13;
government contribution refers of course to its contribution qua subsidy,&#13;
not its contribution qua employer. In addition, the -system derives income&#13;
from investments and certain earnmarked taxes.&#13;
Payroll Taxes&#13;
Over time, in the Chilean system, there has been a tremendous shift&#13;
in the distribution amongst the three sources, as the table below&#13;
indicates. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
employers' share and that of the state have increased dramatically, while&#13;
that from investment income has dwindled from. 14% in 1940 to 2% in 1975. The&#13;
first shift reflects the changes in benefit policies introduced in the 1950's&#13;
by many funds. For reasons which will be explained in detail later on, these&#13;
led to an explosion of payroll tax rates as well as a growing need for public&#13;
subsidy. Payroll taxes on employers have increased eight-fold since 1952;&#13;
the employees' own taxes five-fold.&#13;

Table IIIo14 gives some idea of the extent of this payrell tax explo-&#13;
sion. Rates presently range from 4L.5 percent to a high of 79.6 percent0 19/&#13;
In all funds, the very high cost of providing the services is borne largely&#13;
by the employers although employee costs are by no means small.&#13;
19/  Payroll tax rates of this magnitude raise inevitable questioas about&#13;
shifting and labor displacement0 The issue has been treated extensively&#13;
in Aninat (1971) "The Elimination of Payroll Taxes for Social Security:&#13;
Estimation of its Impact on Employment"' and (1976) "The Income Effects&#13;
of the Payroll Tax on Various kinds of Labor Markets: The Chilean Case",&#13;
and in Kornevall (1977) '9A Change in the iinancing of Social Security&#13;
and its its Effects on Employment"o Both approach the question via the&#13;
production function, and use a priori elasticities of substitution which&#13;
range from 0.6 to 1G00  The effect on employment has been alternately&#13;
estimated as a 6-11% (Kornevall) increase in the number of nrew jobs&#13;
which would be created with the elimination of payroll taxes and an&#13;
8 - 25% increase (Aninat 1971).&#13;

Investment Income&#13;
Throughout the recent period, investment income has been neg:.`gble.&#13;
Although the funds were all originally expected tc be fully capitzlized, by&#13;
1950, the gradual switch to the pay-as-you-go basis which has been taking&#13;
place since the 1930's was almost completed. This change was not due so much&#13;
to a conceptual evolution in the thinking about financing, but was the&#13;
response of the institutions to the difficulties of maintaining t&gt;e1ir reserve&#13;
fund intact in the inflationary Chilean environment0   In this e.nv:.onment,&#13;
the investment policies followed by the institutions, and later th-.e invest-&#13;
ment guidelines codified by the government ir 1952 made the inadevuate&#13;
capitalization of the surpluses inevitable. These policies themsel'ves had&#13;
been largely responses to pressures from aff.liates, who wished to see the&#13;
trust funds used in a manner which benefited them, being made av&amp;.lIable to&#13;
them through loans and mortgages, rather than invested in the economy at&#13;
large. The switch to a pay-as-you-go scheme was thus in the nature of a&#13;
default by the institutions in the face of the near impossibility of main-&#13;
taining proper financial practices under these pressures0 The irClationary&#13;
environment and poor investment choices led to a situation in which&#13;
capitalization was simply no longer feasible, and interest income therefore,&#13;
an insignificant contributor to the system's resources0&#13;
Government Payments&#13;
The financial contribution of the government is three-fold. it malkes&#13;
a direct contribution to the system in its role of employer, it a,so pays a&#13;
direct subsidy, and it transfers the proceeds from a series of eaLrmarked&#13;
taxes to certain institutions for w'om they are earmarked0&#13;
This high proportion of government subsidy shown in Table I17 .03 is in&#13;
part a reflection of the way the benefit structure developed0 As the&#13;
institutions grew to accomodate larger numbe.rs or ampllfied their range of&#13;
benefits, they were for various reasons unable or unwilling to raise the&#13;
revenues required to finance them via additional employer and employee con-&#13;
tributions. With respect especially to the CANWAMPU, it is ironIc that this&#13;
public sector institution was introduced precisely to free the Treasury from&#13;
all obligations (other than qua employer) in the social security ophere.&#13;
According to their original conception, the public sector instit:-'.ons, and&#13;
indeed all institutions, were intended to be self-sufficient. The size of&#13;
the government subsidy to them is an indication of their inefficacy as inde-&#13;
pendent agencies based on principles of private insuranceo The 'ollowing&#13;
table shows the distribution of the government subsIdy across the three&#13;
types. The direct subsidy is by far the largesto&#13;

A problem of quite some notoriety in some Latin American countries which&#13;
arises out of such tripartite arrangements is that the government, qua&#13;
employer or otherwise, may be quite lax about fulfilling its obligations to&#13;
the system. This was at one time especially true in Bolivia, for example,&#13;
where the compliance of the government in meeting its obligations has been&#13;
no more than 25%. 20/ More recently, this type of problem has arisen in&#13;
Costa Rica.   Similar abuses by the corporate sector have also been common.&#13;
Outright failure to pay is less frequently encountered than are late pay-&#13;
ments, often with such a lag that the real value of the liability is reduced&#13;
substantially. Corporate remissness has oEten been overlooked by authorities&#13;
in order to avert financial difficulties which might in turn develop if&#13;
businesses were forced to meet these major tax obligations. 21/ Such evasion&#13;
has not been widespread in Chile. Family allowances are paid directly by the&#13;
20/  Reviglio. F. "The Social Security Sector and its Financing in Developing&#13;
Countries"; IMF Staff Papers, November 1967.&#13;
21/  The problem with permitting this is that the government sacrifices its&#13;
control over some financial flows in the economy and its selectivity of&#13;
determining who should and who should not receive relief is reduced.&#13;
From a macroeconoic point of view, the implications are much more&#13;
serious. Permissivieness with regard to major tax obligations leads to&#13;
a situation in which the government increases its own subsidy to the&#13;
system and its deficit which in turn l:uels inflation. the higher rates&#13;
of inflation themselves encourage and facilitate tax remissness, touch-&#13;
ing off another cycle of deficit and inflation.&#13;

see to it that full up-to-date coverage is maintained for themo   t2 is thus&#13;
only in the realm of pension contributions that evasion is commono While&#13;
allegations are frequent, there are no figures estimating this.&#13;
Issues in the Chilean System&#13;
This summary description has highlighted some of the shortcomings of&#13;
the Chilean social insurarce system0   The factors contributing to lts weak-&#13;
ness are clealy interrelated and many owe the2r existence to the atomistic&#13;
organizational form which the system has developed. The primary weakness is&#13;
equity. The range of benefits authorized by the various regimes indicates a&#13;
profound discrimination among social groupso Inequities of an equally fun-&#13;
damental nature are inherent in the eligibility requirements for these&#13;
benefits0 Other inequities arise from the degree of protection which the&#13;
various groups receive against inflation, a source of inequity which fre-&#13;
quently remains disguised0 Historically, the fragmentation in the 1930's of&#13;
the Seguro Obligatorio and EMPART and the withdrawal of the better-off worker&#13;
groups left the SSS as the "'catch-allV lnstitution, and quite destitute, the&#13;
remaining SSS affiliates, most of them from the lower income groups and&#13;
almost uniformly eligible for minimum pensions when this law came to be&#13;
enacted, continued to drain the fund0   The Servicio de Seguro Social&#13;
responded by laying down increasingly demanding eligibility requirements to&#13;
stem the demands on its resources, among them longer years of inpayments and&#13;
concurrent requirements0   The insolvency and reduced benefit levels in turn&#13;
accelerated the withdrawal of affiliates to other, better paying institu-&#13;
tions, leaving the Seguro Social with the genuine "uninsurables"9&#13;
The second issue of the Chilean system is its efficiency in terms of&#13;
the cost of getting benefits to the affiliates0 Administrative costs are&#13;
very high, on the order of 11-14% of the funds' total income0 This is a&#13;
result of the endless duplication of administrative superstructures for each&#13;
of the 35 institutions, each with its own accounting, legal, actuarial,&#13;
medical, investnent, revenue collection and benefit distribution departments&#13;
and offices0  The other side of the cost picture iS, of course, the extensive&#13;
nature and coverage of the benefits0 The broad geographical and social reach&#13;
of the system also imply additional costs0 WPhile this is an overt choice and&#13;
owes itself to publicly legislated policy and not to the fragmentation of the&#13;
system per se, the diversity of the funds has made cost-control and any&#13;
effective cost-acounting over the system as a whole very difficult. Con-&#13;
solidation of accounts and comparability studles are the task of the Superin-&#13;
tendencia de Seguridad Social0 Nonetheless, since numerous institutions do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not come under its purview, 22/ even here, there is no easy means of account-&#13;
ing for the costs of the system as a whole.&#13;
The third major issue is the investment policy followed by the funds&#13;
-- a policy which resulted largely, again, through the capture of the system&#13;
by special interest groups. It was a policy which was shortsighted and which&#13;
was developed, seemingly, entirely outside of the inflationary context in&#13;
which the system operated, preventing the funds from obtaining the actuarial&#13;
return required to maintain themselves on a financially viable footing. As&#13;
the funds' inability to earn a fair return on assets became more acute,&#13;
pressures to decapitalize also grew; by the mid-1950's the trust funds were&#13;
being used as the source of benefit payments and within another decade, the&#13;
system had been virtually entirely decapitalized, and was receiving large&#13;
sums from the central government.&#13;
These three issues -- equity, efficiency and capitalization policy --&#13;
are the most important ones facing the system today, and which must be con-&#13;
fronted in any reform of the system. Together they have contributed to the&#13;
system's single biggest failing, namely its ultimate failure, within 30 years&#13;
of its inception, to provide the contractual benefits promised to affiliates&#13;
except through large scale bail-outs from the central government, not-&#13;
withstanding the frequent increases in payroll taxes and other earmarked&#13;
taxes.&#13;
There is an object lesson in all of this since many of the strains faced&#13;
by the Chilean system are common to systems in other developing countries.&#13;
Very similar pressures are also faced by many developed countries and have&#13;
led to similar outcomes. Experience with capitalization has not been an&#13;
unqualified success in many countries. 23/ The past half century of&#13;
experience with social security has seen many capitalized systems succumb,&#13;
drawing down their trust fund to pay out current benefits.&#13;
22/ The National Defense Funds and the Banking sector institutions, among&#13;
Others.&#13;
23/ The United States system, for example, designed and introduced in 1935&#13;
as a fully funded system, had degenerated within a decade and a half to&#13;
its current pay-as-you-go status.   The breakdown was due in large part&#13;
to the decision to extend blanket coverage to edrly affiliates due to&#13;
retire shortly after the system was introduced, but who had not paid in&#13;
full complement of contributions. The extension of coverage to spouses&#13;
and the introduction of survi'rors' pensions also contributed to the&#13;
decapitalization of the system. The most recent of benefits without&#13;
actuarial foundation is one (January 1978) which authorizes benefits for&#13;
divorcees of a 10 year marriage, thereby permitting payments to multiple&#13;
ex-spouses on one empLoyee's account. (The duration of marriage for&#13;
divorce benefits was reduced from 20 years.)&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There is a school of thought which saggeots that the change-'ovar from&#13;
capitalization to a pay-as-you-go financing ls an Znevftable part :oi the&#13;
evolution of social insurance schemes.  ihese    r 5l thLeir earcly stagns are&#13;
frequently small and exclusivistic, coverirng           ontially only civil e3rvice,&#13;
the armed forces, banking, maritime, TE:Â°way and public utt77Nt'-es, trhen urban&#13;
manufacturing workers, and only much, much later, if evTer, t7he  ral sector&#13;
and almost never independent workers. Private insu2ance pzinci:ple   are&#13;
difficult to apply the latter workers groups. Tzbei7r low Mages m2kc It dif-&#13;
ficult to demand the contributory rates which wour.6 be reouired act-oarially&#13;
to cover them, and the absence of stablc employLment makes other af`filiation&#13;
requirements unfeasible. Nonetheless, It is 1-ikc_Ly that a goverriLmet con-&#13;
cerned with income distribution and social ecjaglIty wvil. mnove at scme point&#13;
to extend social insurance coverage to these w.rg&gt;a. groups or tTrvt pressure&#13;
groups will develop to demand incorporation0   it -' at this point tha-t finan--&#13;
cial tensions frequently arise0  Social. goals c-;; U'knanclfa. autonomy are not&#13;
usually compatible0&#13;
The evolution of a system and the eid.esnson of coverage to .nclude&#13;
society's "poor risks" is one which unc6znrably implles additional expense0&#13;
The decision to extend coverage to groups unable to pay thneir own `&gt;isk&#13;
premia"t, is simply not compatible with adhererce to strIct 'nsurance prin-&#13;
ciples and actuarial funding0  These pri:.nciples become increas:ngly difficult&#13;
to maintain as income redistribution suceeds inccme ma:intenance as an&#13;
objective of social securityo 24/  FreqjuentLy, therefore, this conceptual&#13;
evolution is also accompanied by a graceua-v switch fron funding to&#13;
pay-as-you-go financing, since payroll taxes for continued capitalf.zation&#13;
are simply too high, and thence to generiL -z:venue M.nancing0  The switch, of&#13;
course, also puts an end to the system's savings mobilÂ½aization.&#13;
The Chilean experience seems to lndicate that once the str:ct relation-&#13;
ship between contributions and benefits is severed and competing notitons of&#13;
24/  As Wolfe (1967) points out for LatIn America, in those counr.r..es in&#13;
which social security is fairly new, such as Mexico (1942) ;' raguay&#13;
(1943), Bolivia (1956), Jamaica (1965), Venczuela (1366) and Colombia&#13;
(1966), the tendency has been to inc.reasG the depth - the range of&#13;
benefits -- of the programs0  The geographical extension of coverage&#13;
on the other hand, has been restricted, la-rgely because of thc expense&#13;
which it inevitably entails0   Countr:'es with older systems suc^ as&#13;
Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, on the other h_aad, have develiored more&#13;
broadly based coverage0  This forms the basis for Woife's two'o.od group-&#13;
ing of Latin American social insurance schemesg those wrose scahemes are&#13;
largely without financial worries, but w&#143;ich face a "cris-is c exclu-&#13;
sion", and those older programs fecing a c:Isi9s of inclusfon'c  tfide and&#13;
deep coverage with a tenuous link between bene.U'its ond contr',Outions and&#13;
the concomittant financial worries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social justice, fair shares and even raw political power come into play to&#13;
determine the new basis for allocating benefits and contributions with con-&#13;
commitant pressures for redistribution amongst the members, the system&#13;
becomes extremely vulnerable to capture by special interest groups.&#13;
The issues are especially intractable precisely because the purpose of&#13;
social security is rarely addressed directly at the time these pressures&#13;
arise. Is it a transfer scheme which is desired (in which case, as we have&#13;
seen, actuarial principles and capitalization are inappropriate) or is the&#13;
objective a forced savings scheme with some "insurance" added? As the fol-&#13;
lowing section on the evolution of the Chilean system makes clear, this&#13;
question must be addressed at every turn where a choice is to be made, lest&#13;
the end result come to resemble something very different from what was&#13;
originally intended.&#13;
The Chilean System: Maturity and Decapitalization&#13;
The Chilean system, like most social security programs, was conceived&#13;
originally as a fully capitalized fund. In the oldest Latin American systems&#13;
it was generally the analogy with private insurance which made this financial&#13;
setup the obvious choice. In the later systems, the savings potential of&#13;
social security was more often explicitly recognized and provided the basis&#13;
for the capitalization decision.&#13;
In Chile, the decapitalization of the social insurance reserve fund&#13;
followed the evolutionary route described in the previous paragraphs. Social&#13;
imperatives led to the introduction of many new benefit regimes which were&#13;
costly from an actuarial point of view. Social imperatives also affected&#13;
the funds' portfolio choice. Its 50-year history of inflation notwithstand-&#13;
ing, Chile took to indexing only very recently and even rather reluctantly in&#13;
the face of strong constituent pressures regarding the investment policy and&#13;
stringent sanctions against "usury"(which included the indexation of debt) in&#13;
the Napoleonic civil code. Inflation thus eroded the real value of the&#13;
reserve fund which in an actuarial system would have been drawn on to pay out&#13;
benefits, and reduced the funds' capital income which, in an actuarial sys-&#13;
tem, would have supplemented payroll levies in a systematic way.&#13;
Social Imperatives and Benefit Policies&#13;
Social security institutions in Chile, as elsewhere in Latin America,&#13;
have not escapecl being used as instruments of social policy. 25/ The&#13;
emphasis has been on administrating and providing social services so that&#13;
little attention was devoted to examining the wider financial implications of&#13;
many policies wlhich the institutions pursued at the behest of the government,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
nor was the financial potential of the system ever seriously explored.&#13;
Financial planning was regarded as a secondary, an accessory, though&#13;
unavoidable task. In short, there was a general feeling that goveznment&#13;
should concern itself with providing benefits     to dwell on their financing&#13;
smacked of reactionism, and the "private" mentality, denying the primacy of&#13;
social concerns. This emphasis explains much of the subsequent history of&#13;
both benefit and financial policies.&#13;
The development of increasingly socially oriented policies can be traced&#13;
in Chile through three periods. Firstly, social security has always had a&#13;
social orientation in Chile. Its broad coverage, as early as 1925, attests&#13;
to this0 Nonetheless during the first 30 years of the system's operation&#13;
(1924-52), it was run generally speaking, on insurance princlples, with&#13;
income maintenance, not redistribution as the primary object0 1952 marked&#13;
a watershed for public policy with respect to social security0 Attention&#13;
focused on providing for the poorer groups in the labor force and their&#13;
families, and sfmple programs of income maintenance were deemed insufficient0&#13;
Because attending to the needs of society's "poor risks" could not be recon-&#13;
ciled with private insurance principles, their low incomes and employment&#13;
habits making this impossible, these principles were implicitly dropped when&#13;
the benefit programs were expanded0 By 1952, the Chilean Congress had made&#13;
the definitive decision to emphasize the secial rather than the insurance&#13;
aspects of social insurance, and it was a leap of some dimensions0 While&#13;
there is no doubt that the decision to increase benefits and provide coverage&#13;
to groups of workers usually outside the scope of social security made these&#13;
poorer groups much better off, it is equally undeniable that the 1952 reforms&#13;
made the breakdown of the earlier actuarially funded scheme inevitable.&#13;
The most important new benefit of this second period was the minimum&#13;
pension, introduced because of the observed low level of actuarial pensions&#13;
for many groups0 Since pensions were a function of the level of past con-&#13;
tributions, which in turn, were a function of income, persons were inevitably&#13;
low, poor lowu-earning groupso This would have been the case even had con-&#13;
tribution rates been high0 A minimunm pension, which exceeded the income&#13;
related pension was therefore introduced to insure an acceptable standard for&#13;
all retiring workers0&#13;
The low level of actuarial pensions were, ironically, themse.ves an&#13;
indirect result of an earlier government policy0 The ceilings on the frac-&#13;
tion of income subject to payroll taxes had been lowered at various times to&#13;
reduce the burden of this tax on poorer workers affiliated to the Caja de&#13;
Seguro Obligatorio. Since the payroll tax base was also the base salary on&#13;
which pensions were calculated, the very policy which sought to reduce the&#13;
payroll tax burden for these workers also limited the benefits0&#13;
The minimum pension reform completely changed the solvency of many of&#13;
the funds, since the program was introduced without explicit financing arran-&#13;
gements. It was left implicit that the difference between the actuarial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pension and the minimum should be charged against the trust-fund, supple-&#13;
mented if necessary, by subsidy from the government.&#13;
A poor interpretation of the minimum pension law dealt the Servicio de&#13;
Seguro Social an especially heavy blow. In provisions dating back to 1925,&#13;
affiliates had always been given the option of withdrawing their acquired&#13;
entitlements as a pension, or in a lump-sum. Fewer than 5,0000, out of some&#13;
40,000 retired members chose to draw a pension, the majority opting for the&#13;
lump sum entitlement. Later, this same group was held to qualify for a&#13;
minimum pension, on the grounds that while they had fulfilled all the&#13;
requirements with respect to age and number of contributions, they were not&#13;
receiving any regularly paid pensions; and the Seguro Obligatorio paid out&#13;
twice. 26/ In addition to low income, the other characteristic of the labor&#13;
force in many less developed countries including Chile is the informal and&#13;
discontinuous nature of employment. Thirty years of continuous, salaried&#13;
employment is likely to be the exception rather than the norm. Recognizing&#13;
this, social presures once again led to the rejection of the so-called&#13;
private mentality, which would suspend benefits for those who failed to&#13;
comply with the requirements of the funds, and would have left them with few,&#13;
or no entitlements. 1956 thus saw the introduction of "continous protec-&#13;
tion", a methocl whereby those whose employment history was spotty, could fill&#13;
in the gaps in their contributions.&#13;
This provision gained some notoriety, not because of its intent but&#13;
thanks to the financial sleight of hand which was devised to finance it.&#13;
Workers, who at. retirement found themselves ineligible for pensions, could&#13;
apply to the social security institutions for a loan to make up the missed&#13;
contributions and thereby secure eligibility. The fund would then grant the&#13;
pension, and the recipient was to service the loan out of the pension itself.&#13;
Interest rates and maturities on these loans, as on all financial dealings of&#13;
the institutions were laid down in organic laws legislated by Congress. The&#13;
debt service ratio could not excced 20% of the pension. In the logic of the&#13;
times, this did not limit the principal of these loans to an amount whiclh&#13;
generated repayments less than the 20% ceiling, but implied simply that the&#13;
debt service charged to the pensioner could not exceed 20% of his pension,&#13;
with remainder charged to the institution. The continuous protection innova-&#13;
tion dealt another heavy blow to the financial position of the system, espe-&#13;
cially to the Servicio de Seguro Social, whose affiliates were most likely to&#13;
come up against eligibility requirements.&#13;
Amendments to the 1952 reforms were continuous throughout the following&#13;
decade. In 1961, pensions were made adjustable to inflation, and early&#13;
retirement, at 55 instead of 60, was introduced for women. Assistance pen-&#13;
sions were another major innovation. These were granted to the "aged and&#13;
indigent" who had not ful1illed the eligibility requirements for even the&#13;
26/ Servicio de Seguro Social informants.&#13;
-61-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
minimum pension. Shortly thereafter, earLy retirement waY&amp;s also grzated for&#13;
those engaged in heavy labor, and the minimum levels of orphans&amp; an-d widows&#13;
survivors' pensions were raised. All of these changes were costly from an&#13;
actuarial point of view; only for the inflation adJustment and for the assis-&#13;
tance pensions was financing even explIcitly provided.&#13;
New groups of workers were incorporated into the system throughout the&#13;
period as well. Fishermen, taxi drivers, newsboys, hairdressers, azl&#13;
obtained coverage. (Agricultural workers and domestic servants had long&#13;
since been covered.) Financing for these groups was quite 2xpl4cl t, but they&#13;
were not, it is now conceded, self-supportingo&#13;
Those benefits which could not be financed on a current basis were&#13;
generally charged against the trust fund, or covered by the government which,&#13;
although it had no specific obligations, undertook the general obligation to&#13;
support the institutions when they were unable to pay out benefits laid down&#13;
in the organic laws0  Tables IIIo16 and III.17 show the difZerences between&#13;
the level of cash surplus the system generated whnen this pub3ic subsidy is&#13;
included and when it is netted out0 By reducing the size of the cash&#13;
surpluses which in the 1940's were 20'30% of receipts but by tne 1360's had&#13;
become negative, the generous but inadequately financed benefit po3l.cy&#13;
destroyed the actuarial basis of the system and made full funding quite&#13;
impossible0&#13;
To sum up, by 1952, the Chilean legislature had made a definite choice&#13;
to change the nature of the social insurance system0   The decisior was made&#13;
to benefit the many workers, who because of their low wages and eTployment&#13;
opportunities, would ordinarily be disqualifÂ£ed under an actuarial system run&#13;
in accordance with strict insurance princxpies. The legislation introduced&#13;
in the course of the 1950's opened up the system to almost all wo7kers and&#13;
awarded generous benefits to most0   Aocwever the focus of the reforms was on&#13;
the benefits side0 Financial aspects of the new programs were vir-tually&#13;
neglected and for those benefits which were introduced with an explicit&#13;
financing arrangement, these were frequently deficient0 Since the new&#13;
programs once legislated became part of the body of "oorganic laws" governing&#13;
the institutions, the entitlements they delineated had, by law, to be paid&#13;
out by the institution, regardless of its financial situation0 To the&#13;
affiliate, they became acquired rights which had to be honored0 'The cost&#13;
of many of the reforms, especially the minimum pensions and the early retire-&#13;
ment was high, and it was all charged against the reserve fund0    Thus, by&#13;
1952, the eventual switch to a pay-as-you-go system was made inevltable,&#13;
being the only response politically possible to the financial pressures&#13;
brought on by the new benefit programs0&#13;
Portfolio Choice and the Reserve Fund&#13;
In addition to the clamor for ambltious benefits, there were also pres-&#13;
sures on the Chilean social security reserve funds from the investment side0&#13;
There are three basic criteria for the investment of social insurance&#13;

is the one used by private pension funds, who invest for a target rate of&#13;
return. Alternatively, surpluses may be invested in line with the perceived&#13;
development goals of the country. In this case, investment of the cash&#13;
surpluses will be coordinated with, sometimes subordinated to national&#13;
investment priorities. This policy may mean investment in favored sectors&#13;
such as steel and transport, or social investments such as housing, clinics&#13;
and schools. Such investment may be direct or indirect, as when the funds&#13;
invest in government securities. Finally, surpluses may be used in keeping&#13;
with the needs of the present generation of affiliates, since the surpluses&#13;
are, in fact, "their" funds, held in trust for them. Surpluses can be&#13;
returned to the affiliates through personal loans, housing, or mortgages,&#13;
social facilities, etc.&#13;
The type of portfolio depends in part on the extension of the system&#13;
and the kinds of risks with which it deals. Liquidity of investments and&#13;
good cash management are primary concerns when protection against short-term&#13;
risks figure importantly in the system's coverage. For systems in which&#13;
pensions predominate, long-term securities are appropriate and liquidity&#13;
becomes of secondary importance.&#13;
Because the magnitude of the social security reserve funds and the&#13;
potential resource allocation impact has made the investment of these&#13;
surpluses something of national interest in almost all countries, it is quite&#13;
rare that the first criterion, the quasi-independent solution, is chosen. In&#13;
Latin America, it has operated only in Venezuela where it is required that&#13;
surpluses be invested with consideration to the lucrativeness of the invest-&#13;
ment and maintenance of real asset values. In Argentina, surpluses have been&#13;
channelled through a special fund for investment in steel, transport and&#13;
other essential economic sectors. In Bolivia, Mexico and Ecuador, invest-&#13;
ments of the funds are directed towards hospital, clirtics, loans and the&#13;
like, with the qualification that these earn a specified return. Investment&#13;
in private securities is allowed only when these are backed by adequate&#13;
sinking funds for the repayment of interest and principal.&#13;
The great importance of social security surpluses and their potential&#13;
impact on national investment and social welfare also made the portfolio of&#13;
institutions something of national interest in Chile. Very shortly after&#13;
their founding, most larger Cajas' financial dealings became subject to the&#13;
governance of the legislative branch. A growing body of legal dispositions&#13;
came to control the investment of the cash surpluses, and the semi-fiscal&#13;
institutions ceased to have much control regarding the manner in which their&#13;
funds were invested. In addition to the legal guidellnes for the investment&#13;
programs, they were also scrutinized by the Ministry of Finance to coordinate&#13;
the national investment programs.&#13;
The emphasis of the investment legislation throughout the system's&#13;
history has been social. In keeping with the third criterion, funds were to&#13;
-65-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be used for the benefit, directly or indirectly, of the institut'ion's&#13;
affiliates. The range of permissible investment initIally includcd mortgage&#13;
loans, personal assistance loans, rental property and other real estate, as&#13;
well as government securities. The involvement of the Chilean Congress&#13;
however, went far beyond simply the investment guidelines for the portfolio,&#13;
which was only one of the instruments through which social aims cculd be&#13;
pursued. Congress set the interest rates which could be charged on each type&#13;
of loan, their maturities and amortiziation rates0 Rent controls were also&#13;
established in the buildings owned by the Cajas for let to affiliates0 In&#13;
short, the social insurance reserves, invested in line with the third&#13;
criterion, provided a gamut of additional bsenefits -f from loans to sub-&#13;
sidized housing - to the system's affiliateso&#13;
Specific policies regarding investment of the surpluses can be grouped&#13;
into four periods which mark a conceptual evolution regarding appropriate&#13;
investment policies0 Table IIIol8 indicates how the portfolio comaposition&#13;
changed as a consequence of the policy choices wfhich were made0&#13;
Throughout the initial period, from the establishment of the funds untn'l&#13;
the late 1940's, safety of investment appears zo have been a pzime criterioro&#13;
Government securities, and securities of public corporations, mortgage loans,&#13;
savings deposits and rental property and other income earnings real estate&#13;
were the permissible categories0 These six categories corresDond to invest-&#13;
ment traditionally considered to be risk free0&#13;
1952 saw the establishment of a much broader and more integral system cf&#13;
social security, and also a conceptual change in ideas regarding &amp;he invest-&#13;
ment of surpluses0 The development of a national housing program made it&#13;
natural to channel the surpluses towazds construction and acquisition of&#13;
houses, and the Cajas became involved in construction programs of their own..&#13;
As Table IIIo18 shows, after 1952, the proportion of the portfol'-o in real&#13;
estate increased substantially0 Purchase of the securities of p rI7vate cor-&#13;
porations was also permitted (as long as they were haighly rated) but these&#13;
have never played an important role in the portfolio0   Finally, 'Â£he pract'ce&#13;
of granting assistance loans (which were introduced in 1930) iwas institution-&#13;
alized, and these quickly became an important category of asset to the&#13;
institutions, and an important new source of benefits to the affiliateso In&#13;
short, the 1952 laws greatly broadened the scope of the permissible port-&#13;
folio, embracing priivate securities and opening the way for the newest of&#13;
benefits, the use of the systems' funds for its own affiliates. The primacy&#13;
of the social goals becomes quite evident in this period0&#13;
After 1952, the range of permissible investments continued so grow, but&#13;
the changes were generally marginal and affected only small groupsG (Thus,&#13;
loans could be authorized for additions and improvements to existing houses,&#13;
rather than solely for construction of new units, and a certain proportion of&#13;
the loans was earmarked for affiliates with large families and foT the poorer&#13;
members0) In the 1960's the social emphasis took on a slightly aew slant, as&#13;

a series of one-time loans was legist'&amp;edD such Ps loans to residents of a&#13;
drought stricken area, and earthquake victims0&#13;
1959 marked a drastic change in both the fina'cial adm',nistTat.on of&#13;
the portfolio as well as in the structure of the portfolio itself. The&#13;
intent of the new law, the "Decreto coo Fuerza de Ley #2'" was to emphasize&#13;
the financial aspects of the investments, and bhe lmportance of protecting&#13;
real asset values, without prejudicing any of {the social legislation oi-&#13;
previous reforms. Loans and mortgages thus became fully indexed t:o the&#13;
inflation rateo The housing program oi the varilus institutions was con-&#13;
solidated, and all surpluses not destined for assistance loans and other&#13;
direct benefits to affiliates were thenceforth turned over to the state&#13;
housing corporation, Corporacion de Vivienda (CORVI)o Housing became the&#13;
exclusive purview of this institution, a reform which was intended to stream-&#13;
line the funds' own involvement and reduce thneir administrative costs.&#13;
The final policy change came in l974.   nhe pr-imacy of social goals&#13;
receded almost entirely and transfers of the fundse transfers to CORVI were&#13;
suspended. Government securities became the cnly permissible asset. The&#13;
list of permissible investments is again being gradually broadened to include&#13;
private securities, but the financial aspects of invesrmeat alternatives are&#13;
ever stressed: personal loans and moztgages a-e no longer granted0   The model&#13;
which the government hopes to follow is one in which the social security&#13;
sector gives impetus to the fledgeling capital2 market by providing a new&#13;
source of industrial financing and by encouragirg previously closely held&#13;
corporations to go public.&#13;
The social policy pursued by the Chilean Congress through the investment&#13;
strategy of the Cajas was not without cost0 D13regard for sound finanicial&#13;
management devastated the funds' asset position just as neglect of the&#13;
benefit policies' financial aspects had jeopa-dized it0 Ironically, social&#13;
aspects of investment were accentuated as the --ate of inflation accelerated.&#13;
Safeguards against inflation losses were introduced only after great hesita-&#13;
tion; since they inevitably implied tougher loaa terms to the furds'&#13;
affiliates, they were politically unpopalar wit'i the congresional con-&#13;
stituency.&#13;
That the funds' financial constrEUnts would imply a concomitant :inan-&#13;
cial sacrifice appears to have been ignoredo The tLradeoffs do not appear&#13;
to ever have been explicitly recognized, tbough ihe costs were evident even&#13;
as early as the 1930'so&#13;
Experience with real estate, which in 1925 made up the bulk of tae&#13;
funds' assets, was especially unsuccessful0  Ti-e problems were ttbc-fold.&#13;
Some were due to the great diversity in the types of holdings tjh:.ch the funds&#13;
acquired and the funds' generalized lack of administrative experience0&#13;
Secondly, the norms governing all aspects of the funds' financi&amp;a dealings&#13;
were legislated in, and presumably fore a peri:od of relative price stability0&#13;
Inflation was simply not a parameter at this tCme0 Since these norms were&#13;
-68-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
laid down in organic laws, they were entirely inflexible and could be amended&#13;
only with great difficulty.&#13;
The range of properties which the funds chose to own was wide. It&#13;
included rental properties, farms, casinos, theatres and cinemas, resort&#13;
complexes and office buildings. This diversity, both of type and location&#13;
made administration difficult. Moreover, good administrators were hiard to&#13;
find, since their remuneration was limited by law to the salary of someone&#13;
of "equivalent" rank in the social security administration. The farms and&#13;
commercial buildings, both purchased for commercial exploitation, were there-&#13;
fore seldom well administered and generated little income. Once again, there&#13;
was confusion between social goals and financial principles. Controlled&#13;
rents were so low that they did not cover building maintenance expenses, much&#13;
less amortization and interest costs or an adequate rate of return for the&#13;
Caja. Mortgage loans, the other mainstray of the portfolio, making up some&#13;
30-40% of the funds' assets in the fist period were granted on easy terms.&#13;
By law, they had 30 year maturities and carried a 6% interest charge. Debt&#13;
service limits were also set, limiting repayment of mortgage loans to 20% of&#13;
income. As with the provisions for "continuous protection", the principal&#13;
loaned was not generally constrained -- only the debt service. The losses to&#13;
the system as a whole which occurred as a result of these policies have never&#13;
been directly calculated. A study of the investment policy of a single&#13;
institution, EMPART, concludes that for this Caja alone, for mortgages, on&#13;
average, less than 14% of the principal plus interest due was recouped during&#13;
the 1925-52 period. While no study has estimated the cost of the rent con-&#13;
trols nor imputed overall losses directly to poor administration, since the&#13;
organic laws applied to all semi-fiscal institutions, the outcome is fairly&#13;
generalizable. It is known, however, that when the institutions sold off&#13;
their commercial properties and farms they did not, in general, fare well.&#13;
By the 1950's the economic consequences of the financial guidelines and&#13;
administrative regulations had become quite clear. The funds' capital income&#13;
which had been expected to supplement payroll tax contributions did not do so&#13;
to any significant degree, and the asset position of the funds was also&#13;
precarious. In 1952, an attempt was made to reduce the major source of&#13;
losses -- the long amortization period of mortgage loans. The repayment&#13;
period was shortened to 16 years, although for social reasons, the interest&#13;
rate was left at 6%. The simple modification of the amortization period&#13;
reduced the erosion in the real value of the loan principal due to inflation,&#13;
but losses continued to be sustained due to failure to adjust the interest&#13;
rate. The percentage of principle and interest due which was recouped in the&#13;
case of EMPART on loans of this period (1952-1959) was 39%. With respect to&#13;
personal assistance loans, the recouperation rate during this period was on&#13;
the order of 20-30%. Much of these losses were due to write-offs of the&#13;
loans. Frequently, collection costs exceeded the value of the installments,&#13;
and rather than collect them, these amounts were simply written off as bad&#13;
debts. Since mortgage and assistance loans together made up some 35-40% of&#13;
the portfolio, the losses the interest rate policy implied were substantial.&#13;
-69-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It was not until 1959 that any real attempts were made to deal with the&#13;
seriousness of the situation. As Table IIIO.Y shows, the value of the assets&#13;
of the social insurance system in real terms declined between .946 and 196O,&#13;
in spite of the record growth in the surpluses the system was gencrating&#13;
during this period (Table II1120)o The DFL #2 was one of the many reforms&#13;
introduced in the aftermath of the 1959 Klein-Saks mission to Chi;'e0   Loans&#13;
made under DFL#2 were fully indexed; the intorest rate (4%) thus represented,&#13;
for the first time in 35 years, a real interest charge. To soften the blow&#13;
of the stringency of the new financial conditions, the terms of the loans&#13;
were again lengthened to 30 years0   Nonetheless, even with the DE.J #2, it was&#13;
impossible to get away entirely from the social imperatfves0   The loans were&#13;
indexed in accordance with changes in the consumer price index or the index&#13;
of wages and salaries, which ever was the lower0   Because of this,&#13;
approximately 98% slightly less than the entire real value of the loans under&#13;
DFL #2 was recouped.&#13;
Other laws, however, continued to jeopardi%e the funds' fincncial&#13;
return, even after 1959. these were primarily the "leyes moratorv7s" intro-&#13;
duced by the Allessandri administration and continued under that of Frei, 27/&#13;
which allowed debtors to suspend repayments during validated p2riods of&#13;
personal hardship.&#13;
The other innovation of the DFL #2 was the housing program0 From 1959&#13;
on, all of the surpluses from the semi-fiscal institutions were chanelled to&#13;
CORVI, the national housing agency. The plan was that CORVI should take over&#13;
all of the Cajas' construction programs, turning over completed units to the&#13;
institutions for sale to affiliates and others0 The portfolio of the&#13;
institutions consisted, thereafter essentially, of only assistance and mort-&#13;
gage loans0 The functioning of the program and the recuperation of the&#13;
funds' transfers to CORVI was once again impaired by the absence of any&#13;
inflation safeguards0  The biggest problem was cost-overruns due to the&#13;
rising cost of construction and materials0   However, there w^ere also simply&#13;
unaccountable delays in construction, which in turn delayed the 1:zansfer of&#13;
completed units to the social insurance institutions0 The funds thus lost&#13;
twice: cost overruns implied that they got fewer houses than they had paid&#13;
for, delay in completion put off the date at which the cajas cou:Ld sell the&#13;
unit and begin to collect income from it0 The estimated erosion ln real&#13;
values of the CORVI transfers for the EMFART fund is about 57%, -hat is,&#13;
EMPART recouped in terms of value of housing units received only 43% of the&#13;
monies transferred to CORVI0&#13;
To sum ups, the implications of DFL #2 for the funds' asset position is&#13;
uncertain0 Unquestionably, it put all end to the majore abuses of the old&#13;
loan system0 On the other hand1, the housing program itself generated losses0&#13;
The combined effect is difficult to determine; loans constituted a larger&#13;

fraction of their assets than did CORVI transfers and so it is likely that&#13;
the net effect was positive. Table III.19 shows that their asset position&#13;
did indeed improve after 1959 -- although this is the result of interaction&#13;
of factors other than just the two mentioned above.&#13;
The final period from 1974 to the present brings back the criterion of&#13;
profitability and positive real returns to social security. CORVI transfers&#13;
were halted, the portfolio limited to indexed government bonds, which cur-&#13;
rently pay a real interest rate of five percent and have a six year maturity.&#13;
While this guarantees a return for the Cajas,the government would like to see&#13;
the gradual broadening of the portfolio, to avoid incurring excessive inter-&#13;
est liabilities. The monetary authorities are also anxious to avoid a&#13;
repetition of a 1974 occurance in which the surpluses of the social security&#13;
institutions became an instrument of monetary policy -- the cash surpluses of&#13;
that year were channelled to the government and sterilized to reduce the&#13;
money supply. This implied a tremendous volume of completely unbacked new&#13;
liabilities for the Treasury -- liabilities which could only be honored via&#13;
the printing presses, making future monetary policy mc,re difficult, albeit&#13;
assuaging current problems. Diversification of the portfolio into private&#13;
securities lessens the possibility that this could occur anew.&#13;
Since the 1973 change of governments, the pendulum has gone full swing&#13;
from the primacy of social goals to the primacy of financial soundness. If&#13;
the portfolio diversification goes as planned, the system will be operating&#13;
much as does a private pension fund, although full capitalization will remain&#13;
a distant goal.&#13;
The Non-Fiscal Institutions&#13;
The non-fiscal institutions have never been subject to many of t:he&#13;
constraints discussed above which crippled the large semi-fiscal funds.&#13;
Though by law they are obliged to provide the same range of benefits --&#13;
pensions, family allowances, health care and workmens' compensation, they&#13;
are quite free to operate outside of the rigid operational directives estab-&#13;
lished in the Law of Public Administration. Freedom to pursue their own&#13;
investment policy has perhaps their greatest advantage.&#13;
The composition of portfolios of the two groups shows some striking&#13;
differences. Table III.21 shows that on average, throughout the perLod&#13;
covered, the private funds held a larger proportion of their assets in equity&#13;
than did the public cajas, and as inflation accelerated, especially in the&#13;
1970's, less and less was held in cash and deposits. The table is unfor-&#13;
tunately only impressionistic since balance sheet information is not complete&#13;
for all years. While the balance sheet figures are not available for 1974,&#13;
the Superintendency estimates that the trend has been upheld.&#13;
Another aspect of their investment policy cannot be discerned from the&#13;
portfolio composition. While table III.21 shows the investments in real&#13;
estate to be heavy and loans and mortgages as dominant in the portfolio of&#13;

the private funds as in the portfolio of the public funds, it obscures the&#13;
fact that these were not subject to the same directives as the public&#13;
institutions. There were no unions to satisfy, no interest ceilings to&#13;
suffer, no terms to adhere to. Repayment moratoria were not institutional-&#13;
ized, and real estate was privately managed for the private goocl. This&#13;
administrative freedom gave these funds an immense advantage. Their cash&#13;
management was generally excellent -- unlike the public institutions who&#13;
could not make short-term placements outside of "approved" categories of&#13;
assets, and consequently had no alternative but to maintain large cash hold-&#13;
ings and current deposits. One firm's fund, Gildemeister y Cia, relent to&#13;
its own employer, reinvesting the surpluses in the firm itself. While this&#13;
may not be wise on portfolio diversification grolunds, the return was&#13;
generally excellent.&#13;
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the portfolio performance of the&#13;
funds, other than qualitatively. The size of a fund's surplus and changes&#13;
in its assets position depend on many factors, -- the maturity of the system,&#13;
the changes in tax rates, and the like. Among these factors is also the r&#13;
changes in tax rates, and the like. Among these factors is also the change&#13;
in asset values relative to changes in the price level. There are immense&#13;
complications in tracing these effects on the surplus even for a small fund&#13;
alone: to separate the factors for the system as a whole is quite impossible.&#13;
Thus, any evidence suggesting that the asset position of the non-fiscal&#13;
institutions was more immune to inflation than that of the ones within the&#13;
budgetary public sector will necessarily have to be circumstantial.&#13;
The index of portfolio values presented in Table III.22 shows that&#13;
throughout the period the private funds have fared much better than their&#13;
public counterparts. The value of the private funds' portfolio increased&#13;
by about 900%, that of the others increased by just over one half.&#13;

While some of the difference is indeed due to differing patterns of retire-&#13;
ment among affiliates and the differing burden of non-actuarial-minimum&#13;
benefit obligations, it is unlikely that the entire differential can be&#13;
attributed to these factors. Much of the explanation clearly lies in the&#13;
principles of investment management followed by the two sets of institutions.&#13;
Because of their superior investment performance, the private funds are,&#13;
at present, fairly sound from a financial point of view0 Their benefits are&#13;
consistently higher than those of the semi-fiscal institutions, even though&#13;
for some of them, payroll tax rates have not been increased since 1959. In&#13;
sum, though necessarily impressionistic, the evidence suggests that inflation&#13;
was not the sole cause of the decapitalization of trust funds: a somewhat&#13;
more inflation-proof policy could have been followed0&#13;
The Lessons: Social Policy and Financial Tensions&#13;
The history of the investment policy of the social insurance institu-&#13;
tions highlights the antagonism between the social and political demands for&#13;
uses of the funds' resources and financial imperatives for fiscal soundnesso&#13;
The decision to follow the third investment criterion     to use the&#13;
surpluses to benefit those for whom they are held in trust      is an entirely&#13;
legitimate choice0 However, the Chilean authorities, in opting for the&#13;
social criterion neglected to take into consideration the economic environ-&#13;
ment and the inflationary condition of the economy, and to design the policy&#13;
accordingly0 A balance between social goals and financial principles seems&#13;
to have been impossible to reacho Indexing of debt, even when inflation&#13;
rates reached 50% a year, was seen as usurious, repayment periods of less&#13;
than 30 years seen as harsh, market-level rents at odds with the very prin-&#13;
ciples of social equity0&#13;
Ironically, the legislators' social goals were themselves not attained0&#13;
Those affiliates who received mortgages, assistance loans, or rent-controlled&#13;
housing needed received a windfall0 But their number was a small fraction of&#13;
all the total affiliates0 Moreover, the social policies prejudiced the&#13;
institutions' solvency and impaired their ability to extend even those&#13;
benefits guaranteed by laws a fortiori thelr ability to increase future&#13;
benefits. Payroll taxes were increased eight times from 1952 to the present&#13;
in order to finance those benefits which were considered "acquired rights"&#13;
for affiliates0 In short, the bulk of the affiliates paid very dearly for&#13;
the socially-oriented investment policy designed to benefit them, in the&#13;
absence of a better balance balance social goals and financial principles.&#13;
In the long runs failure to follow financial principles benefitted very few0&#13;
Other countries, notable Mexico and Ecuador , have also acknowledged&#13;
social goals in their investment policy     but always subject to a minimum&#13;
profitability constraint0 The explanation behind why Chilean legislators did&#13;
not see fit to do this lies in the existence of a powerful and effective&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
trades-union constituency, and the Chilean democratic process. This,&#13;
however, lies outside the scope of the dissertation.&#13;
It becomes clear from the foregoing discussion that social security was&#13;
openly used by politicians to mobilize support from among worker groups. New&#13;
voting constituencies were won over through the integration of additional&#13;
sub-categories of employees into the system, groups of increasingly weak&#13;
financial standing. Affiliation was accomplished without the corresponding&#13;
measures to fund the new membership. Moreover, existing benefits were&#13;
liberalized, as in the case of the lowering of the retirement age, without&#13;
corresponding changes in the contribution side to maintain things on an&#13;
actuarial basis.&#13;
These changes concommitantly also had the effect of increasing the&#13;
extent of redistribution within the funds between various worker groups, and&#13;
the social contract required for the success of any social insurance system&#13;
became harder to maintain, as the private insurance analogy reached further&#13;
and further. As discussed earlier, the social contract ultimately did fail,&#13;
and eligible employee groups joined the better off cajas, leaving the&#13;
broad-based cajas with a weak financial base.&#13;
When to the above conditions were added problems of inflation with an&#13;
absence of financial instruments yielding a positive real rate of return and&#13;
an investment policy which militated against capital accumulation and main-&#13;
tenance of real asset values, the maintenance of a self-financing system was&#13;
no longer viable.&#13;
Finally, there was another external factor: the growing maturity of the&#13;
system and the changing demographic structure. By the 1950's the first&#13;
generation of early affiliates were eligible for retirement, and demands on&#13;
the outpayment side of the system began in earnest. In any system, the&#13;
attainment of maturity shows the system at its most vulnerable, when the&#13;
accuracy or lack of it of actuarial assumptions can swing the balance between&#13;
a system in equilibrium and a system in deficit. Until this point, inac-&#13;
curacies may be disguised since surpluses still accumulate. This aspect puts&#13;
additional strain on the system.&#13;
With the exception of the factor of maturity, all of the elements dis-&#13;
cussed above can be subsumed into one basic Eactor; namely the danger of&#13;
capture of the system by special interests. This took place on both the&#13;
benefits side and the financial side of the system in Chile.&#13;
But these factors should not be regarded as singular to Chile; the&#13;
contention is that the tensions whose unsuccessful resolution undermined the&#13;
ultimate viability of the Chilean system -- including the problem of special&#13;
interest groups -- are present or latent in the concept of social security.&#13;
Chapter Four discusses the experience of some social security success stories&#13;
in Asia, analyzing the factors which differentiate them from the Chilean&#13;
system, and pointing out the features which could lead to weaknesses akin to&#13;
those which undermined the Chilean system if not carefully controlled.&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
Social Security -'he Asian Experience&#13;
The social security systems of AsiLa are often cited as examplcs of&#13;
success cases of social insurance programs in lesser developed couatries.&#13;
As the conventional wisdom goes, the Asian institutions are on sound finan-&#13;
cial footing, benefits are reasonably broad and affiliation extends to a&#13;
significant proportion of the labor forceo In this chapter some illustrative&#13;
Asian systems will be described in detail and the enabling factors in their&#13;
success will be analyzed and contrasted wit'h the factors leading up to the&#13;
degeneration of the Chilean system. The discussion draws heavily on the&#13;
Shome &amp; Saito work on saving mobilization ln Asian social security systems&#13;
(IBRD, 1977).&#13;
Some attempt will also be made to define the terms on which a social&#13;
security system can be considered successful and to pinpoint the rationale&#13;
for social security. This will not be done by setting up some arbitrary&#13;
standard, but by illustrating, through the experiences of selected Asian&#13;
countries, what can be accomplished for a given cost and what the tradeoffs&#13;
are between financial independence on the one hand, and extension and depth&#13;
of benefits, on the other.&#13;
The Asian Systems - An Overview&#13;
The Asian systems differ from the Chilean and other highly developed&#13;
social insurance systems in the nature as well as the scope of the protection&#13;
they offero At the risk of overgeneralizing, they are narrower ir concep-&#13;
tion, covering far fewer people, and have limited benefit programs for those&#13;
who are covered. In four of the five countries reviewed in this study, for&#13;
example, provident funds, rather than pensions provide insurance for old-age,&#13;
invalidity and death. The two types of protection are very different from the&#13;
point of view of adequacy of benefits as well as quality of protection0&#13;
They also differ markedly in their financial structure0 Financing is&#13;
generally bipartite, shared by employer and employee, with no subsidy paid by&#13;
the government0 Investment income contributes considerably to receipts,&#13;
enabling payroll taxes to be kept low, and all funds have been maintained on&#13;
an ongoing actuarially sound basis0 All have, therefore, Deen successful&#13;
mobilizers of gross savings0&#13;
The following table provides an overview of the five systems this chap-&#13;
ter will cover0&#13;

As the table shows, in all countries except the Philippines, provident&#13;
funds rather than pension schemes afford old-age, invalidity and death&#13;
protection. These entitle affiliates to the amount of their paid-in con-&#13;
tributions plus interest, in a lump sum, at age of retirement, or in the&#13;
event of death, to their survivorso None of the countries provide family&#13;
allowances or unemployment, though, in the social insurance system. All have&#13;
work-accident programs, and sickness and maternity benefits are available in&#13;
both the Philippines and in India. In the remaining three countries, the&#13;
public health system -- wholly government financed - covers these contingen-&#13;
cies.&#13;
Payroll taxes on the employees and the employer finance the provident&#13;
funds' retirement and other benefits. Rates are much lower than in the&#13;
Chilean system, ranging from 8% in the Philippines, to 20% in Singapore.&#13;
Coverage varies by country. In Malaysia, all workers are eligible for&#13;
affiliation in the fund and 70% of the labor force is effectively covered0&#13;
In the Philippines, all employees are eligible, and just over 25% of the&#13;
labor force was covered as of 1974. In India, coverage extends to about 3%&#13;
of the labor force.&#13;
The Asian systems also differ in that they are far younger than the more&#13;
developed western systems; most were begun in the middle or late 1950's.&#13;
They are therefore less "mature"1 in many respects than the Chilean system&#13;
which antedates the earliest of them (Malaysia, 1952) by some 40 years0 Each&#13;
of the systems is discussed in greater detail in the paragraphs which follow0&#13;
Malaysia&#13;
The Malaysian social insurance system includes programs for retirement&#13;
and death, the Employees' Provident Fund, founded in 1952, and the invalidity&#13;
and work injury programs, founded in 1969 and 1929 respectively, administered&#13;
by the Ministry of Labour, through the Social Security Organization. The&#13;
Employees' Provident Fund covers employed uorkers, with the exception of&#13;
those who are members of equivalent pzivate plans, such as teachers (who&#13;
enjoy protection under the Teachers' Provident Fund, founded in Y962, and&#13;
administred by the Public Services Department). The Armed Forces, and public&#13;
employees also have special systems0 Sickness and maternity benefits are&#13;
provided separately, with the government bearing the entire cost through the&#13;
budget of the Ministry of Health0 All residents are covered within the limit&#13;
of available services0&#13;
Funding for the social security system derives from the conteibutions&#13;
of employees, who pay approximately 6% of earnings up to a specified ceiling&#13;
and employers, who contribute 7% of payrolL0 There is no contribution by the&#13;
Government to either the Employees' Provident Fund, nor to the invalidity&#13;
scheme0 The benefits payable accrue to affiliates at retirement in a lump&#13;
sum, with interest currently credited on contributions at 6.6% (i379)0 Both&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social security institutions operate within very clear guidelines regarding&#13;
the investment of surplus funds, and the maintenance of asset values.&#13;
Table IV.2 below shows the extent of the coverage of the Malaysian&#13;
Employees' Provident Fund, in terms of the number of affiliates as a percent-&#13;
age of the total population, and of total labor force. The percentage of the&#13;
population covered has grown from 14.8% in 1960 to almost 24% in 1975. As a&#13;
share of the labor force, its coverage has risen from just under 42.2% in&#13;
1960 to 70.3% in 1975. As a fraction of national income, contributions to&#13;
the system have grown from 1.3% in 1960 tc, 1.8% in 1975. This is less than&#13;
the increase in coverage, which is probably a reflection of the income ceil-&#13;
ing on contributions.&#13;

The Malaysian system has been quite successful in broadening coverage&#13;
and in incorporating lower income groups into the system, countering the&#13;
common criticism of social security systems in less developed countries that&#13;
they benefit more the upper and midle income employees rather than the lower&#13;
income groups, who because of their low earning power are unable to make the&#13;
required contributions. 1/ The Employees' Provident Fund was aimed at incor-&#13;
porating lower income groups, to the extent: it was administratively feasible,&#13;
from its inception. Thus initially it covered employees whose salary was&#13;
$M400 or less, but only employees of estab:Lishments with more than five&#13;
workers. This latter requirement was abolished in 1964, opening the way for&#13;
informal sector employees, and in 1970, the income ceiling was lifted, round-&#13;
ing out membership further and giving the fund a stronger base. Thus, to the&#13;
1/ Although provident funds do cover these groups, they provide no remedy&#13;
for the problem arising out of the fact that low incomes imply low levels&#13;
of contribution and hence smaller lump sum benefits at retirement.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
extent that inclusion in a forced savings scheme provides protect2ion to&#13;
affiliates, 2/ the Malaysian Employees' Provident Fund can be adjud.ged to be&#13;
successful in providing such protection. HoweverDas noted in the dincussion&#13;
at the beginning of the chapter, the adequacy of benefits and the q,:ality of&#13;
protection differ markedly from the assistance provided through a pension&#13;
scheme (not least because the lump sum benef:.t is vulnerable to&#13;
post-retirement inflation by comparison with a monthly pension whic'h, more&#13;
likely than not is at least partly cost-of-living adjusted). This should be&#13;
kept in mind in any comparisons of the Asian provident fund systems and the&#13;
pension-based systems.&#13;

The resources mobilized by the Employees' Provident Fund have been&#13;
growing since its inception. The scheme has only recently matured, with a&#13;
full cycle of contributions0 The net surplus of contributions over expendi-&#13;
tures has been quite sizable throughout the past 20 years, reaching almost&#13;
50% of receipts in 1972. The contribution of the surplus is also indicated&#13;
by the very large proportion of the Fund's total receipts made up by invest-&#13;
ment incomeo Income from investments has risen from 1108% in i960 to 22% of&#13;
receipts in 1974.&#13;
The evidence suggests that the Employees" Provident Fund is a Yfell run&#13;
organization0 Administrative expenses have ranged from 0.7% to 100% of&#13;
receipts over the period0 3/ This streamline(d management is made possible by&#13;

retirement benefits, disability pensions and public health.&#13;
India&#13;
Social security protection is provided in India through the Employee&#13;
Provident Fund, founded in 1952 and administered by the Ministry of Labour.&#13;
It provides death and retirement benefits through a provident fund, and all&#13;
employees in registered firms with 10 or more employees are covered, with&#13;
the exception of public sector employees, railway workers and miners, each&#13;
of whom has a separate scheme. In addition, sickness and maternity benefits&#13;
are provided through the Employees' State Insurance Act (since 1948) and&#13;
work-injury has been covered since 1923. Neither family allowances nor&#13;
unemployment insurance are provided through the provident fund.&#13;
Employees and employers share the costs of old-age protection, each&#13;
contributing 6.25% of earnings or payroll; the sickness and maternity scheme&#13;
is also contributory. Both state level and the national governments provide&#13;
a small subsidy to each of these as well as to the work injury insurance.&#13;
Benefits totalling the employee and employer paid-in contributions, plus&#13;
interest, currently 7.5%, accrue to affiliates in a lump sum at retirement.&#13;
The table which follows provides an in,iication of the extent of coverage&#13;
of the Indian system. In 1976, some seven and a half million subscribers&#13;
were covered by the Employee Provident Fund. This represented just over 1%&#13;
of the total population and 3.1% of the worlcing population. In terms of&#13;
employees in the organized sector, 39% were covered. Although these figures&#13;
represent a steady increase in coverage over the past two and a half decades&#13;
-- initially employees in only six industrial sectors were covered --&#13;
coverage remains very low compared to any oi the other Asian systems analyzed&#13;
in this discussion, and indeed compared to almost any social insurance scheme&#13;
anywhere.&#13;

As a fraction of national incomes, the Indian system is also quite narrow&#13;
in comparison to the Asian systems studied. Receipts as a fraction of GNP&#13;
have grown from 1o9% of GNP in 1960 to 3.2% in 1973.    Nonetheless, although&#13;
the Indian system is a small one, the surplus generated through the system,&#13;
which amounted in 1973 to 39% of receipts1, made a significant contribution to&#13;
national savings.  As table IVo5 shows, tne surplus has increased fairly&#13;
rapidly since 1960, from 25% of the fund's receipts to 39% in 1973o This has&#13;
been largely due to growth in the number of affiliates of the system, through&#13;
the incorporation of new employee groups and a broadening of the funds'&#13;
geographical scope. The Indian system 'Ls clearly far from mature0 Contribu-&#13;
tions are likely to exceed payments for a very long time to come, as the&#13;
possibilities for broadening the system have hardly been tapped.&#13;
As one would expect from an immature provident fund, the contribution&#13;
of investment income to the system's total receipts has been significant,&#13;
although not as large as in the case of Malaysia0 Investment income has&#13;
risen much faster than the surplus, rising from 5% of receipts in 1960 to&#13;
10.4% in 1973. This indicates a successful investment strategy which has&#13;
succeeded in maintaining asset values and obtaining high rates of return0&#13;

The Indian Employees' Provident Fund has also been successful in keeping&#13;
administrative costs low0 The expenses of admiaistering the Employee Provi-&#13;
dent Fund have ranged from 0.5% to 008% of receipts in the past two decades,&#13;
a level similar to that of the other Asian systems discussed in this chapter0&#13;
The reasons are also similar0 Benefits are limitedg only lump sum retirement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
protection and limited maternity and sickness and work injury coverage are&#13;
provided. The benefit regimes furthermore are limited in scope: only&#13;
employees in the organized sector firms are e:Ligible, and then, only in a&#13;
limited number of the industrial districts. The limited geographical extent,&#13;
the limited benefits, and the design of the oLd-age insurance system as a&#13;
provident fund, are all important enabling factors in the ability of the&#13;
system to keep costs low, and thus in its financial success. However, from&#13;
the point of view of the limited geographical extension, as well as its&#13;
ability to offer protection to diverse employee groups, the Indian system is&#13;
severely deficient. The social insurance scheme does not, in any sense,&#13;
provide protection to economically weaker sections, such as the more general-&#13;
ized systems of Western Europe or the United States do. Indeed, because of&#13;
the limitless resources this would absorb, it could not. The Indian case&#13;
highlights the enormous implications in terms of costs, of social insurance&#13;
for society's "poor risks", those who cannot pay for their own coverage. It&#13;
also illustrates the theme that success in both the financial realm (in the&#13;
sense that the system is self financing in a viable long-term sense) and the&#13;
social realm, providing insurance to those unable to pay the "premia", may&#13;
involve goals which are mutually exclusive.&#13;
Sri Lanka&#13;
The social insurance institution in Sri Lanka is the goverment regulated&#13;
Employees' Provident Fund, established in 1958, which provides lump sum&#13;
benefits for old age, invalidity and death. The system covers all empLoyed&#13;
people with some exceptions, such as day laborers, family labor and, of&#13;
course, public employees. Private pension funds which were operating prior&#13;
to the inception of the Employees' Provident Fund were also allowed the&#13;
option of integrating into the system, or remaining outside. The affiliates&#13;
of the approximately 400 or so private plans still extant are also not&#13;
covered by the Employees Provident' Fund.&#13;
In addition to the social insurance provided through the Employees'&#13;
Provident Fund, Sri Lanka has a limited national health system dating from&#13;
1939, which, within limits of facilities, provides health care to all resi-&#13;
dents. The cost of the entire scheme is met by the government. There is&#13;
also work-injury insurance, the earliest of all of these programs, as the&#13;
model would lead one to expect, dating back to 1934. This program is volun-&#13;
tary with the employer, and covers wage earners in industry, mining, public&#13;
utilities, construction and plantations. Costs are borne by the employer and&#13;
the government, through the health system.&#13;
Employers and employees share the costs of the old-age protection,&#13;
contributing 6% of earnings and 9% of payroll, respectively. The government&#13;
contributes only if necessary to provide the guaranteed minimum interest&#13;
payments on paid-in contributions. Retirement benefits are the sum of the&#13;
paid-in taxes, taxes of employers and employees, plus interest, payable in a&#13;
lump sum at retirement.&#13;

As one would expect from a relatively young and hence immature provident&#13;
fund scheme (the Sri Lankan scheme is the youngest of the five considered in&#13;
this discussion), the Sri Lankan social security scheme runs a surDlus0&#13;
However due to the broader nature of the benefit structure, the surpluses of&#13;
a fraction of total receipts are not as large as in some of the other&#13;
countries examined, ranging from roughly 20%    30% of total recelpts over the&#13;
period under review, as table IVo7 showso Its present wide coverage suggests&#13;
that this figure is not likely to rise substantially, since contrÂ±butiolis&#13;
will not grow as rapidly as affiliation stabilizes and t'ne system matures0&#13;
Also contributing to this moderate level of surplus is the ,act that&#13;
expenditures on account of public health services made up the bulk of "social&#13;
security" expenditures - approximately 62% in 1970. Since pubs-7c health&#13;
programs are typically financed by the government, and not suited for funding&#13;
because of the short-term nature of the risk, any social insurance system in&#13;
which unfunded benefit schemess, such as public health schemes predominate are&#13;
likely to show a smaller net generation of savings than would a scheme in&#13;
which old-age insurance predominates (providing thae scheme is Eully funcied)0&#13;
Nonetheless, saving through the social security institution has been an&#13;
important form of saving in Sri Larna over the past 25 years0&#13;
Related to the size of the surplus is the extent to which :7'vestmer..t&#13;
income contributes to total receiptso  As the suzplus has incTeased, so has&#13;
the investment income as a proportion of total receipts, rising `rom 205% in&#13;
1962 to almost 8% in 1970. Nonetheless, by com;parison with other countries&#13;
such as Malaysia (in which 20-22% of receipts are derived from earnings on&#13;
investments), Singapore (13%), or the Philippines (16-17%), the Sri l.ankan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
system, by the nature of its orientation, derives a limited proportion of its&#13;
receipts from its portfolio earnings.   This is a ftnction, noted earlier, of&#13;
the limited potential for funding in a social insurance system stressing&#13;
short-term (public health) over long-term (pension-related) benefits.&#13;

Notwithstanding the emphasis on public health, typically the most costly&#13;
type of benefit to administer, administrative costs in the Sri Lankan system&#13;
are still relatively low - in recent years roughly 1.5% of total receipts.&#13;
This is approximately double that of the equivalent figure in India (0.5 -&#13;
0.7%), Singapore (0.4%) or Malaysia (1.0%), but far less than the 5-6% of&#13;
total receipt:s going to administrative expenditures in the Philippines. In&#13;
Chile, the proportion is larger still. In sum, given the emphasis in the Sri&#13;
Lankan system on public health, the administrative costs would appear to be&#13;
in line.&#13;
The Sri Lankan system appears to strike a balance, as does the Malaysian&#13;
one, between coverage and benefits on the one hand, and costs of the system&#13;
on the other. Clearly any such assessment is purely subjective -- it is not&#13;
the result of an analysis of an explicit social welfare function which&#13;
examines social insurance in the context of all other objectives and claims&#13;
on funds. Approximately 18% of the population is covered; old-age protection&#13;
is limited tco provident fund-type schemes, but these benefits are extended to&#13;
close to 90% of the labor force, and a fairly extensive public health system&#13;
complements this. Moreover, over 65 percent of the covered population is in&#13;
agriculture, traditionally the last and most difficult sector to cover. (Sri&#13;
Lanka is from this point of view blessed by its high population density and&#13;
its small size.)&#13;

In sum, neither the range of benefits nor their coverage is as extensive&#13;
as in the Chilean case or the many other examples of broad- based schemes&#13;
such as the US or most Western European countries0   Hovever, the system&#13;
offers some protection, to considerable numbers, for limited costD and with&#13;
substantial additional benefits to the economy derived from the resources&#13;
mobilized through the provident fund.&#13;
Singapore&#13;
The Central Provident Fund of Singapore was established in 1953 and&#13;
provides lump sum old-age, invalidity and death benefitso Tne system covers&#13;
all employed persons, including the self-employed, and excludes only those&#13;
who are already affiliated to equivalent private planso There is also a&#13;
separate program for public employees.&#13;
The coverage of the Singapore Central Provident Fund is the most com-&#13;
prehensive by far of the countries discussed, including Chile. Over 100% of&#13;
the registered labor force is affiliated (those currently receiving pensions,&#13;
but no longer employed underlie this dlfferential) and over 50% of the&#13;
population is covered0 Most of the growth in membership has been recent,&#13;
with the number of affiliates doubling in 10 years0&#13;

In addition to the benefits provided through the Central Provident Fund,&#13;
there is a limited national health program which provides medical care and is&#13;
entirely financed by the government0 Work injury insurance was ti.e first&#13;
type of social insurance established and has been in existence since 1929.&#13;
The costs of the work-injury scheme are met by the employer and cover all&#13;
employees earning less than a specified monthly ceiling0 The costs of&#13;
old-age protection are borne by the employer and employee and there is no&#13;
government contribution to this schene0&#13;
The financing of the provident fund of Singapore is unusual in two&#13;
respectso Firstly it implies the highest compulsory savings rate of any of&#13;
-88-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the systems discussed so far. Contribution rates are 16 1/2 percent on the&#13;
employee and 20 1/2 percent on the employer, bringing the joint rate up to&#13;
37%, very close to the Chilean high     of 48%.  Secondly, it is the only&#13;
system among those discussed to have a progressive contribution rate, with&#13;
no contribution made by those earning less than Singapore $5,200 per month.&#13;
The progressivity does not, however, extend to the benefit formula, the fund&#13;
being maintained along strict provident fund lines so that employees paying&#13;
in at reduced rates also receive a reduced lump sum benefit compared to those&#13;
who contribute at the higher rates. These high contribution rates and exten-&#13;
sive coverage have enabled the Central Provident Fund to be a major con-&#13;
tributor to savings and make the case of Singapore of particular interest.&#13;
Because the social insurance system is so comprehensive in coverage,&#13;
has such high contribution rates, is only presently maturing, and has limited&#13;
non-retirement benefits -- the ideal conditions for savings mobilization&#13;
through social security -- the surpluses generated through the central provi-&#13;
dent can be expected to be large. The figures in Table IV.9 corroborate&#13;
this. Indeed, the savings rate of the Central Provident Fund is the highest&#13;
by far of the five countries so far examined, reaching 67% of receipts in&#13;
1974. The savings are large in relation to national income, approximately 9%&#13;
in 1976, and amounted to nearly 30% of total gross domestic savings in the&#13;
same year. For the same reasons: coverage, high contribution rates, and&#13;
near-maturity, the accumulation of surpluses cannot be expected to continue&#13;
at this level in the future.&#13;

As in the other Asian provident fund systems with limited ncr -p2nsion&#13;
programs, administrative costs as a propo:tiLon of receip-s are aloC lowu, less&#13;
than 005% in 1974, indicating streamlind operatio:zso Singapore's r.nique&#13;
urban configuration and the tremendous locational density of affIZPates are&#13;
also a contributing factor.&#13;
The Singapore social insurance system can be adjudged to be a very&#13;
successful program: Coverage of the labor force is iear eomplete. and&#13;
although on the old-age benefits side   it suf.Â£ers from all the def.ciences of&#13;
a provident fundDsome attempt has been -maaz to limit the compulsozy savings&#13;
rate for the lower income groups, while still prcviding tnem withn a basic&#13;
level of protection. And this has been done without introducing t&#143;,a teasions&#13;
inherent in the Chilean system with its redistribut'Lve programs, s.nce own&#13;
contributions and benefits have been kept related.&#13;
The Philippines&#13;
In the Philippines, social insurarce is prov3.ded througb the occial&#13;
security system, introduced in 1954 to cover all employed persons ir1th the&#13;
exception of the self employed and publ3c employees, wlho have a syntem of&#13;
their own. The social insurance system in the Philippines is, in .7act,&#13;
social insurance, rather than a provident fund, and provides in adition to&#13;
pensions for old age, invalidity and death, maternity and sickness and work&#13;
injury insuranceo&#13;
Growth of the social security system in the Pailippines has not proceded&#13;
as rapidly as in Malaysia or Singapore, and coverage is still substant-I.ally&#13;
below either. 'rhe proportion of the total population covered has risen from&#13;
about 1% in 1960 to 10% in 1974. In terms of labor forceD the proportion of&#13;
affiliates has risen from 3.8% in 1960 to 26% in l974.&#13;

The costs of the Philippine social security system are borne by the&#13;
employer and emp:Loyees through payroll taxes, currently paid in at the rates&#13;
of 4.6% and 3.3% of earnings, respectively, and the government, which is&#13;
responsible for any deficit. There are additional premia jointly borne for&#13;
sicknes and maternity insurance. The cost of work injury insurance is, as is&#13;
typical, borne wholly by the employer.&#13;
The Philippines' old-age insurance is not a provident fund, but a pen-&#13;
sion system. Disability benefits and survivor benefits also take the form&#13;
of pensions. This and the fact that benefits are provided both in cash and&#13;
in kind, make it a costly system to operate. Administrative expenditures&#13;
are quite high -- close to 6% of total revenues in the period under review.&#13;
This is approximately six-fold the level of the other Asian systems, and only&#13;
slightly less than in the Chilean case. This highlights the point made&#13;
earlier regarding the very real cost savings implied by a simple provident&#13;
fund system, involving limited accounting compared to pension, sickness and&#13;
work injury systems, each providing a wide array of benefits to a range of&#13;
beneficiaries under various qualifying conditions.&#13;

The savings mobilization of the Philippine social insurance system hias&#13;
been very effective1, notwithstanding the major emphasis on sickness and&#13;
maternity and work-injury protection schemes Which because of their&#13;
short-term nature, are not operated on a funded basis. The social security&#13;
surplus as a fractLon of receipts is, at 42% in 1970, the highest of any&#13;
country hitherto d:Lscussed with the exception of Singapore. This is partly&#13;
a function of the fact that the system has not yet fully matured, and that&#13;
coverage is still expanding, albeit slowly. Tne scope for continued savl.ngs&#13;
mobilization is very great, since the scheme still has a great deal of scope&#13;
for expansion, providing, of course, that the non-pension aspects of the&#13;
scheme do not expand at a faster rate than the pension scheme, and that the&#13;
pension aspects of the scheme themselves remain actuarially sound. The&#13;
government's policy to increase the geographic reach of the system by&#13;
decentralizing operations and to broaden its coverage among workers in the&#13;
area outside of the capital may enable this expansion and therefore this&#13;
savings rate to be maintainedo Another effect of the decentralization policy&#13;
will be to broaden the coverage of the social security scheme across income&#13;
groups, i0e., to cover the non-urban population in outlying areas0    To the&#13;
extent that coverage is in fact broadened, the system is directly facing up&#13;
to the challenge faced by most such schemes in developing countries, namely,&#13;
the incorporation of lower income and hard-to-reach groups into the reach of&#13;
social insurance0 Since less than 30% of the working population was covered&#13;
by 1974, the Philippine system cannot yet be said to have met this challenge&#13;
successfully.&#13;
-92-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Asian systems described here have made great strides in the 20-30&#13;
years since their inception. Relatively rapid growth in coverage has taken&#13;
place, benefit regimes have been expanded, the geographical and distribu-&#13;
tional reach of the systems have received attention, and financially, the&#13;
schemes are self-supporting, showing few of the financial and other tensions&#13;
discussed in an earlier chapter, which characterized the Chilean system. In&#13;
this section some of the enabling factors in their ability to meet the suces-&#13;
sive challenges which developing a system poses will be discussed, and an&#13;
attempt will be made to define the common threads in their achievements.&#13;
Criteria for Evaluation&#13;
There are a number of criteria against which the performance of a social&#13;
insurance system can be measured. On the benefits' side, a social insurance&#13;
schemes could be judged on the basis of its coverage and ability to extend&#13;
benefits to a wide range of affiliates who differ in their earning power,&#13;
source of livelihood, and who may be geographically very widely dispersed.&#13;
The comprehensiveness of benefits to be provided is another. A fully&#13;
developed social security system would include old-age protection, health&#13;
benefits in cash and in kind, family allowances, and unemployment insurance.&#13;
The levels of benefit provided, moreover, should be adequate. This could be&#13;
measured, in the case of cash benefits, in terms of past earnings' replace-&#13;
ment levels. Another aspect of successful coverage is the system's ability&#13;
to provide protection for those especially hard to cover -- the very poor&#13;
whose income levels do not enable them to participate in any meaningful sense&#13;
in contributory schemes.&#13;
On the financial side, the ability of the scheme to finance itself is&#13;
among the most important criteria. This requires that the scheme be&#13;
actuarily sound and properly funded, if this is desired. The schemes should&#13;
be efficiently administered in terms of transforming the contributions into&#13;
the largest possible benefit payout. To avoid distortions and other&#13;
problems, payroll taxes should be reasonable. Their level is a function of&#13;
benefit levels, efficiency of administration and the investment policy which&#13;
determines the extent to which investment receipts can supplement income from&#13;
contributions. Finally, if funded, assets should be well invested, with&#13;
clear guidelines for minimum profitability and allowable risk, so that the&#13;
investment income contributes as much as possible to the expansion of&#13;
benefits or lowering of contribution rates.&#13;
Facilitating Factors&#13;
There are a number of factors, external, structural and design which can&#13;
make success in either the benefit or financial side easier to achieve. For&#13;
example, administrative expenses will inevitably be lower when old age&#13;
protection is provided through a provident fund instead of a pension system.&#13;
A narrower range of benefits, likewise reduces administrative costs, as does&#13;
a homogeneous population spread over a limited geographical area, other&#13;
things being equal. The first enabling factor has to do with the design of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the system, the second with its structure, and the th4rd is an external&#13;
factor, a given with which the designers of the system must contend0&#13;
Perhaps the most important enabling factor in the successful operation&#13;
of a social insurance scheme is the relative homogeneity of the population&#13;
covered. This can occur either through explicitly designing the system to&#13;
cover only certain employee groups or may simply characterize a country's&#13;
population (Singapore, for example)0 The great advantage of a homogeneous&#13;
group of affiliates is that every member is able to pull his weight0    No&#13;
special benefits, financial allowances or exceptions are required for the&#13;
worse-off affiliateso There is no need, and therefore no pressure, for the&#13;
introduction of redistrubtive aspects to the systemo The result is that the&#13;
link between contributions and the expected value of benefits reccived can be&#13;
maintained quite closely -- for pension and current benefits alfkeo&#13;
When economically diverse populations are to be covered, questions of&#13;
redistribution immediately come to the fore. In the case of old age&#13;
insurance, pensions, typically a function of contributions, which in turn are&#13;
determined by past income levels, may be unacceptably low (as perceived&#13;
politically or by politically powerful groups') and there will be pressures&#13;
to raise them0 This can come at the expense of the better off affiliates in&#13;
the system, it can be acomplished through subsidies paid into the system by&#13;
the government, or it can be financed by means w+hich jeopardize the financial&#13;
solvency of the program0 The consequence of any of these measureG inevitably&#13;
involves tensions between the interests of diverse groups, tensicns vhich may&#13;
not be easily resolved, once the process is begun. Typically, in countries&#13;
where the trades-union constituency is strong, the latter methods (government&#13;
subsidies or measures which jeopardize solvency, such as withdrawals from the&#13;
trust fund) are likely to be employed. Voting coalitions are likely to&#13;
emerge between different employee groups, leading to an overall expansion of&#13;
expenditures on social insurance programso&#13;
It is also unquestionably more difficult administratively, ,:o cover an&#13;
affiliate population of widely divergent economic backgrounds0    Lower income&#13;
groups may have erratic work histories, calling for complicated (compared to&#13;
a provident fund) integratlon and reintegration formulae0   The mcore&#13;
homogeneous the population, the easier it is to achieve broad coverage&#13;
without excessively high costs, whether from the point of view of administra-&#13;
tive expense, subsidy, or costs arising from tensions in the social contract0&#13;
Because of these difficulties, social insurance in less developed countries&#13;
generally begins by insuring homogeneous g.oups, at the cost of w.eaker sec-&#13;
tions and the rural, geographically harder to reach sections, GO that&#13;
coverage remains narrow by design0&#13;
Homogeneity can also be achieved in other wuays0  The estaTl:s.$hment of&#13;
dual social insurance regimes, a general scheme and a special fund for civil&#13;
service or other priviledged group of employees is very typical of new sys-&#13;
tems and can be seen as a means of forestalling the tensions wtihich would come&#13;
94Â°&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about due to pressures for redistribution in a scheme with heterogeous mem-&#13;
bership. The dual system satisfies the requirement of the better-off group&#13;
of employees for higher quality benefits. It also enables some protection to&#13;
be made available to a broader group of less well-off affiliates. 4/&#13;
However, by segregating the higher income groups, and creating a homogeneous&#13;
general system, the ability of the system as a whole to extend coverage,&#13;
subsequently, to the poor risks is compromised, since cross-subsidization&#13;
among groups is no longer possible. Thus while many potential financial&#13;
tensions and problems are avoided by maintaining dual schemes precisely&#13;
because they limit the potential for redistribution, it is this latter aspect&#13;
which simultaneously makes them unsuccessful in terms of wide extension of&#13;
both scope and depth on the benefits side.&#13;
Reducing the scope for redistribution can be achieved by exempting from&#13;
coverage those who are already affiliates of private schemes. This is&#13;
usually done ostensibly to avoid duplication of coverage. Its real effect&#13;
however is the one outlined above, namely to filter out non-homogeneous&#13;
elements, reduce scope for redistribution, and therefore the likelihood that&#13;
pressures for it will develop.&#13;
In the US, where few such exemptions exist and cross-subsidization is&#13;
made possible by the affiliation of a wider range of income groups, stresses&#13;
characteristic of heterogeneous affiliation have in turn developed. In the&#13;
Chilean case the strongly redistributional bias which the system developed&#13;
led, as one would expect, to dissatisfaction with the scheme among the bet-&#13;
ter-off groups at whose expense the redistribution took place. Some groups&#13;
were permitted to opt out of the scheme. Subsequently the remaining unaf-&#13;
filiated better off groups set up schemes of their own rather than joining&#13;
the general schemes. The solvency of the original scheme was thus jeopard-&#13;
ized. The consequences of allowing local government employees to opt out of&#13;
the US social security scheme, for example, a cause for which there is con-&#13;
siderable pressure, would be analogous in its weakening effect.&#13;
These examples make it abundantly clear that there are a variety of&#13;
tensions implicit in the objective of wide-scale coverage when the population&#13;
to be incorporated is diverse and suggests that financial success and success&#13;
in terms of benefits may be incompatible objectives unless the population is&#13;
in fact relatively homogeneous.&#13;
Another facilitating element is the demographic structure of the popula-&#13;
tion. To take the example of a pension system, when a scheme is properly&#13;
funded from an actuarial point of view, it makes no difference whether the&#13;
population is old or young, stable or growing. However, to the extent that&#13;
growth or growth in coverage, which has the same effect, makes it easier to&#13;
mask or disguise marginal errors in actuarial balance, rapid growth in&#13;
4/ This group must be sufficiently well off to be self-financing.&#13;
-95-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
population or coverage is a facilitator even in this case. Increaces in&#13;
coverage, of course, have a much more definite effect on unfunded schemes0&#13;
Because of their pay-as-you-go nature, these are much more easily financed&#13;
when coverage is growing0   PayroLl tax rates can be kept lower as the working&#13;
generation, always larger than the group of retired affiliates, supports the&#13;
older generation more cheaply than that generation could have supported&#13;
itself. For this reason, tensions often arise when payroll taxes or benefit&#13;
levels are adjusted to accommodate a changing demographic structureo The&#13;
'"social contract" required under pay-as-you-go schemes has in many countries&#13;
broken down in the face of top-heavy structure of population, and is one of&#13;
the factors leading up to a switch to general revenue financing. Growing&#13;
coverage postpones the need for those adjustments.&#13;
While the narrowness of benefit regime is not a "success characteristic"&#13;
judged from the point of view of a system's ability to provide protection for&#13;
a wide range of contingencies, when judged from the point of view of finan-&#13;
cial success, it is an advantage. This is because the temptation to&#13;
cross-subsidize among the regimes -- which most often happens when accumu-&#13;
lated pension funds are tapped to meet the requirem2nts of the unfunded&#13;
regimes such as health, family allowances or invalidity - is frequently&#13;
irresistable0 Systems in which Eewer benefits are provided are less likely&#13;
to fall prey to this danger, which to some extent, can be avoided by&#13;
administering different regimes under separate institutions.&#13;
In a similar vein, the design of the various schemes can affect the ease&#13;
with which they are administered and the ease with w^hich internal control&#13;
is maintained0 Provident funds, in which retirement benefits are paid out&#13;
in a lump sum and limited to the amount paid in by each affiliate, are&#13;
clearly more controllable than pension systems0 However the quality of&#13;
benefits provided through them is distinctly inferior. Cash sickness pay-&#13;
ments -- a luxury in terms of benefits - are also difficult to control0&#13;
Actuarial precision is often difficult to achieve and they are likely to&#13;
represent a financial strain0 5/&#13;
Finally, on the investment side, clear and effective guidelines for the&#13;
investment of surplus funds and -- an external factor -- a stable monetary&#13;
environment 6/ greatly facilitate successful operationo Failing either, the&#13;
likelhihood diminishes that the real value of the accumulated capital can be&#13;
maintained and that interest income will contribute as pLanned to other&#13;
receipts, enabling contributions to be kept as low as possible0&#13;

The taxonomy outlined above suggests that the elements contzibuting to&#13;
successful performance on the benefits side and those facilitati.g financial&#13;
success may not always be coincident and that tradeoffs may be recui7e    as&#13;
the objectives of broad and deep coverage and financial independ-. ce are&#13;
weighed up against each other. The choices made by the Asian systems dis-&#13;
cussed earlier in the chapter can be viewed in this context. As she discus-&#13;
sion which follows will make clear, they have not been immune froLi; the need&#13;
to balance off financial against other goals and their success in terns of&#13;
resource mobilization, contribution of surplus to national savingsD and&#13;
financial soundness has come at a cost of lesser achievements on the s5de of&#13;
benefits0&#13;
The following table summarizes the important parameters of the six&#13;
social insurance systems under review0&#13;
The Asian systems have clearly performed differently from tbo Chilean&#13;
one on the financial side0 The surpluses generated by the funds (line 4)&#13;
suggest a major role in resource mobilizationo In all five count-ies, It&#13;
amounts to over a third of receipts, and in Singapore and Malaysia, to nearly&#13;
50% of receipts0&#13;
All schemes receive part of their receipts     a fairly large part, in&#13;
fact -- from the state0 This transfer ranges from 27% of receipto in India,&#13;
to 38% in Sri Lanka (line 7). For the most part, however, the transfers&#13;
represent no more than the governments' contributions to the pub!lc health&#13;
systems, which in the cases of Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Singapore are entirely&#13;
non-contributory. 7/ Only in the Philippines, where the government is&#13;
responsible for covering any deficit in the pencion system, does the govern-&#13;
ment contribution take on the character of a subsidyo&#13;
In Chile, by contrasts the payment of the government is 2.7 times its&#13;
statutory contribution to the maternity and sickness scheme0   As ln the&#13;
Philippines, a subsidy is required to underwrite the pension systamS its&#13;
magnitudes, however, is far larger- In the Philippines the net surplus of the&#13;
overall social assistance system     the difference between the reze-.pts&#13;
exclusive of subsidy and expenditures     is still substantial and amounts to&#13;
1305% of rece:Lpts (line 4 minus line 7). In Chile, the gross surplus --&#13;
inclusive of subsidy -- is only 11% of receipts0 Net of subsidy tihe sys-&#13;
tem's deficit is approximately 25% of total receipts, or 40% ot t.' e system's&#13;
total outlays in 1970O&#13;
7/ In India, the government contribution is limited to its staLu2ovy con-&#13;
tribution to the employee sickness and maternity insurance sc'-sme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Finally, rates of contribution have also beeen kept far lower in the&#13;
Asian system than in Chile (line 8).   They range from a high of   30% + in&#13;
Singapore to 8% in the Philippines. 8/ By contrast, joint payroll tax rates&#13;
in the Chilean system average about 32%.&#13;
On the benefits side, performance of the two types of system has been&#13;
equally different. 'The table indicates (line 3) the scope of the different&#13;
programs, (line 1) their coverage of the working population , and (line 5)&#13;
expenditures on social insurance as a proportion of national income. In&#13;
terms of scope, the Chilean system is clearly the most comprehensive, provid-&#13;
ing pension as opposed to provident fund old-age protection, family allowan-&#13;
ces and unemployment, in addition to the work-injury protection provided by&#13;
all systems. Sickness-maternity benefits include both cash and in kind&#13;
benefits. The Chilean system clearly, therefore, also provides higher&#13;
quality benefits than do these Asian systems.&#13;
In terms of coverage, Singapore and Malaysia cover close to the entire&#13;
working population, as does Chile. In terms of coverage of the population at&#13;
large, there is no data available. However, judging from the nature of the&#13;
benefits, the Chilean system probably covers rather more dependents than do&#13;
the others, primarily through the system of family allowances, but also&#13;
probably, through the pension system.&#13;
Some idea of the quality or adequacy and level of benefits provided&#13;
through social insurance is suggested by the expenditures on social insurance&#13;
schemes as a fraction of GNP (line 5). In terms of this indicator, the&#13;
Chilean system ranks first by a wide margin; this is so even when administra-&#13;
tive expenditures are netted out (not shown) and expenditures on benefits are&#13;
taken on their own. In the period 1970-74, social insurance expenditures in&#13;
Chile were 12-17% of GNP, compared with 3.6% in Sri Lanka, 2.9% in Malaysia,&#13;
2.6% in Singapore and 1.9% and 1.0% in India and the Philippines, respec-&#13;
tively. While the adequacy of benefits in relative terms may not be&#13;
precisely measured by comparing these ratios, that is, it cannot be inferred&#13;
that Chilean benefit levels are six times better than the Singaporean one,&#13;
nonetheless, the wide divergence is striking and must be attributable to some&#13;
qualitative differences.&#13;
To summarize, where the Asian systems discussed here "succeed" in terms&#13;
of financial policy, they "fail" on the benefits side -- relative to the&#13;
Chilean case. The Malaysian system is on a firm financial footing, and&#13;
maintains a surplus of nearly 50% of its receipts. Savings mobilization&#13;
potential is thus outstanding. Rapid growth in coverage and a provident fund&#13;
pension system with limited national health facilitatfed this. Savings and&#13;
financial performance in the Philippines is also good. However, less than&#13;
one-fourth of the working population is covered. While pension and sickness&#13;
8/ Combined employer-employee rates.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and maternity benefits are provided, expenditures make up less than 1% of&#13;
GNP, suggesting that their level is falrly low.&#13;
Resource mobilization and financial independence llkewise characterize&#13;
the Indian system. Here too, however, the tradeoff is evident. TEhe system&#13;
covers only employees in the major industrial centers in factories employing&#13;
more than 50 persons. Old age protection takes the form of a provident fund,&#13;
and maternity/sickness insurance is in kindo As a fraction of GNT?, social&#13;
insurance expenditures make up just uider 2%, as in the Philippines, their&#13;
overall adequacy is low. Similar tradeoffs are apparent in Sri Lanka &#13;
limited population coverage and benefit variety. A limited public health&#13;
system exists instead of sickenss/maternity and accounts for the highest&#13;
level of expenditures on social insurance0 Singapore is the most unusual of&#13;
the systems, with 100% population coverage, albeit through a provldent fund,&#13;
a public health system and a very high rate of surplus mobilizati'on.&#13;
Tradeoffs are fewer than in the other systems. This is made possible by the&#13;
homogeneity of the population and its geographic density w^hich reduces pres-&#13;
sures within the provident fund for subsidies for the worse-off members and&#13;
limits the administrative and other costs of expansion0 Nonetheless,&#13;
achievements on the side of coverage is offset by limited scope and quality&#13;
of benefits0 And while Singapore has done better than most in balancing&#13;
financial and benefit success, it is something of a special case because of&#13;
its unique geographic and population characteristics0&#13;
These examples provide compelling evidence that few systems are immune&#13;
from the difficulties of attaining the dual objectives of high quality of&#13;
benefits and wide coverage along with financial independence and a high level&#13;
of resource mobilization0 The conclusion is that broad participation cover-&#13;
ing "poor risks" appears simply not to be co'npatible with financing along&#13;
strict insurance principles0 Broad participation implies replacing these&#13;
principles by "social" insurance princ-iples which imply subsidies to cover&#13;
less well off members which must come at the cost of either better off mem-&#13;
bers or the public purse0 The former leads typically to the pressures&#13;
described earlier in systems with heterogeneous membership; the latter is&#13;
a more direct route to government involvement and general revenue financing.&#13;

Chapter 5&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Chapters III and IV have highlighted the choices facing countries in&#13;
administering or expanding a social insurance system and give some flavor of&#13;
their relatively intractable nature. Broad coverage and heterogeneous mem-&#13;
bership is at odds with a benefit package tightly linked to contributions.&#13;
"Quality" benefits, such as pensions rather than provident funds, and&#13;
insurance-type maternity and sickness schemes are more costly to provide and&#13;
difficult to administer. The latter are not suited to financing on a funded&#13;
basis and reduce the savings mobilization potential of the system relative&#13;
to the potential of systems without sickness insurance. And social insurance&#13;
in which contributions do not discriminate, as do private risk premia, on the&#13;
basis of life expectancy, job classification and marital status of the&#13;
affiliates inevitably implies some cross-subsidization between high and low&#13;
risk members. If these high and low risk cases correspond to groups iden-&#13;
tifiable in terms of other characteristics such as income, for example, the&#13;
stage is set for growing tensions.&#13;
Given this background, could one expect the Chilean system to succeed?&#13;
The Chilean system was characterized by a wide and deep benefit regime.&#13;
Benefit levels were high. Nearly the entire working population was covered,&#13;
including the "poor risks" at the bottom of the income scale. Coverage was&#13;
virtually "cradle to grave" -- retirement, invalidity, death, maternity,&#13;
sickness, family allowances and unemployment -- were all provided.&#13;
And facilitating factors were few. The population to be covered was&#13;
relatively unhomogeneous, and geographically widely dispersed. Population&#13;
growth was slow and there was little scope for easing temporary strains on&#13;
the system through growth in coverage since the system began with more or&#13;
less blanket coverage at the outset. Old age protection was provided on a&#13;
pension basis rather than through a provident fund. Investment guidelines&#13;
were directed towards goals quite distinct from guidelines which would have&#13;
served the funds' financial interests. The absence of a stable monetary&#13;
environment, moreover, would have made pursuing an ideal policy difficult in&#13;
any case.&#13;
These features -- the broad coverage, ambitious benefit policy, and the&#13;
lack of facilitating factors -- suggest a priori that the system would prob-&#13;
ably not remain self-financing indefinitely. A priori the model outlined&#13;
in the previous chapter would predict that attempts to broaden coverage,&#13;
given a heterogeneous population, inevitably lead to a breakdown of the&#13;
social contract on which social insurance is posited, the need for goverrment&#13;
intervention and subsidy, and an end to the savings mobilization potential&#13;
of the system. Severing the link between contributions and benefits --and&#13;
it must be severed if "poor risks" are to be incorporated -- is the first&#13;
step in the evolution of a distribution pattern which increasingly requires&#13;
-101-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the better off affiliates to subsidize those at the bottom, the pcc-r: risks0&#13;
Tensions arise, tensions which are frequently irresistable, as it becomeS&#13;
clear to the better off that ",better quality" benefits are avaIlzab .2 thrcugh&#13;
private plans for similar cost. The result: pressure by the batte- off to&#13;
maintain their share, an outcome which can only be accommodated by dipping&#13;
into the funds' accumulated surplus. Failing this, there wilY. be -0resure to&#13;
opt out of the system, which is forestalled as the government interVeneo with&#13;
subsidy.&#13;
Indeed, this scenario fits the fact.s of the Chilean system accurately0&#13;
The domination of the Social Security Service (SSS) by the blue co-la""&#13;
workers led other, homogeneous employee groups to set up their owv fundsp&#13;
depriving the Social Security Service of thce groups whose contributions&#13;
would have subsidized the lower wage groups0&#13;
The broad range of benefits offered through the system also implied high&#13;
administrative costs, putting further pressure on the system's finarces. The&#13;
savings mobilization potential of the system effectively came to zn. end wnen,&#13;
to these existing financial pressures, was added a policy for investing&#13;
surplus funds which was poorly attuned to the existing financial environment.&#13;
In sum, the Chilean outcome conforms to the predictions of the model:&#13;
This leads to the next question, Under w-hat circumstances does social&#13;
security best operate?   How should a system be designed if it fs Gc operate&#13;
successfully; and, can a system in fact work ever?&#13;
The design of a system depends on the objectives of the government0&#13;
Ultimately, the objectives of any scheme will be to cover as much of the&#13;
population as possible, with protection for most coutingencies to the highest&#13;
standard possible, although governments may vary in their perceptc-3n of the&#13;
urgency with which progress toward attainment of these objectives must move0&#13;
The system will also be expected to be self-financing from the cor.tributions&#13;
or premia paid by the affiliates0 The previous chapter indicated that a&#13;
number of features can be incorporated into the design of a social insurance&#13;
system which serve to minimize or postpone the tensions inherent in attempts&#13;
to expand coverage, including a close link between contributions and&#13;
benefits, provident fund retirement insurance and administering the various&#13;
benefit regimes under separate funds0 Experience of the cross-section of&#13;
schemes examined in chapter IV suggests, however, that the only de3ign fea-&#13;
ture which can truly assist in successful operation is, in fact, -estricted&#13;
affilation unless the population is very homogeneous0 Th.e AsIan systems have&#13;
remained self-financing precisely because of their limited coverage,&#13;
Singapore and Malaysia on the strength of their relatively more hcuogeneous&#13;
populations and higher income levels0 Expanding coverage to incl-;de those&#13;
unable to afford the premia ultimately undermines the successful oreration&#13;
and self-financing characteristics of the system, This is true of all manner&#13;
of benefits. pensions, health insurance, unemployment1, family allClyances0&#13;
The net benefits to the better off affiliates called upon to subsd&amp;ize those&#13;
less able to pay for themselves may become unacceptably low as covzrage is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expanded, especially as the lowest income groups and the geographically most&#13;
dispersed, for whom the costs of coverage increase rapidy, are incorporated.&#13;
In sum, it is probably not feasible to expect social insurance to operate&#13;
successfully in a financial sense while maintaining full coverage.&#13;
There is one exception to this, namely, if the population is very&#13;
homogeneous. In such a case, incorporating all the working population does&#13;
not imply increasing costs, and can be achieved with no negative implications&#13;
for the benefits and premia of existing affiliates.&#13;
The implications of the model outlined in the previous chapter and the&#13;
experience of the Asian and Chilean systems do suggest some guidelines for&#13;
less developed countries intent on expanding an existing social insurance&#13;
system or introducing one.&#13;
The lessons learned from the survey in chapters III and IV are that the&#13;
danger of capture of the system by special interest groups or its use for&#13;
political ends should not be underestimated. Also, that tensions become&#13;
irresistible when one group is called upon to subsidize another, and that&#13;
these tensions -- if redistribution is carried beyond a certain point --&#13;
often ultimately lead to the breakdown of the social contract and the need&#13;
for intervention by the government.&#13;
The guidelines for less developed countries seeking to avoid these&#13;
problems are that careful design, by minimizing redistribution, can minimize&#13;
tension. Steps to expand coverage should be closely examined for their&#13;
effect on the net benefits enjoyed by existing members and on the financial&#13;
status of the operation, if existing members are sufficiently powerful to&#13;
prevent a diminition in the real value of their benefits. Should repercus-&#13;
sions appear likely in the wake of costly expanded coverage, the tradeoff&#13;
between expansion and financial indenendence will have to be acknowledged and&#13;
resolved. The resolution -- in favor of expanded coverage and ultimate need&#13;
for subsidy or postponement of expansion and financial viability -- is an&#13;
entirely political question and cannot be decided on economic criteria alone.&#13;
Chile chose one path, the Asian systems the other. Each is "successsful"&#13;
in its own way, and each remains with major failings. There does not appear&#13;
to be any escape from the tradeoff.&#13;
This conclusion augurs poorly for the overall savings implications of&#13;
social insurance programs. For if household savings are affected by par-&#13;
ticipation in a social insurance program, which chapter I suggested may be&#13;
the case, the induced reduction in their savings cannot be expected -- in&#13;
the long run -- to be made up through the accumulatidns of the social&#13;
security institutions. In this case, social security can be linked with a&#13;
decline in overall savings. And if, remaining agnostic on the subject of the&#13;
impact of social security on household savings, these are assumed to be&#13;
unchanged, the model implies only that overall savings will not be reduced.&#13;
Social security does not appear to be an effective means in the long term of&#13;
mobilizing savings. The much touted savings mobilization potential of social&#13;
insurance institutions is short lived and over the longer term, seldom real-&#13;
ized.&#13;

            Savings mobilization through social
            security : the experience of Chile during 1916-77
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Some sort of social security program
            exists in almost all developing countries. This paper
            attempts to examine the savings mobilization potential of
            the social security system in Chile, tracing its development
            from its beginnings as a funded system to its maturity. This
            case study is used to explain the seemingly inevitable
            transformation of the systems' financial basis from a
            trust fund to a pay-as-you-go arrangement, in which there is
            no generation of surpluses and hence, no savings
            mobilization. In addition to the presentation of the Chilean
            system, the paper includes a review of the literature on
            social security and savings, a general survey of social
            security systems, a discussion of what exactly is meant by
            social security, and the experiences of some typical Asian
            systems generally regarded as success stories from the point
            of view of their continued financial viability and their
            adjunct performance in the field of national savings
            mobilization. It suggests that, in the course of maturation,
            tensions between financial viability and success in the
            redistributive arena are inevitable, and that a social
            security scheme is not financially viable and must
            ultimately be financed from general revenues.
