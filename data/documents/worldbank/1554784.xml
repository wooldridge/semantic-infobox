ABSTRACT&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to estimate the level of consumption of&#13;
food and of nutrients for the Indonesian population; to identify population&#13;
groups with nutrient deficiencies; to identify the major sources of different&#13;
nutrients; and to estimate income and price elasticities of demand for both&#13;
foods and nutrients.&#13;
The data source used is the National Socioeconomic Survey for 1978&#13;
(SUSENAS 1978) which included information on the quantities of, and&#13;
expenditures on, about 120 food items consumed. Estimates of food and&#13;
nutrient consumption of different population groups are given, with breakdowns&#13;
by household expenditure class, region and area of residence. The proportion&#13;
of the population with deficiencies in different nutrients is estimated by&#13;
comparing each sample household's food consumption and the implied nutrient&#13;
consumption against the household's own requirements, given the age&#13;
composition of its members. The conclusion is that there are serious&#13;
deficiencies in all nutrients in Indonesia and that the problem is more one of&#13;
maldistribution than of an overall shortfall in the availability of foods.&#13;
The problem is generally more serious in Java than in the Outer Islands, and&#13;
affects the poorer households more severely than better-off households. In&#13;
examining the sources of the various nutrients, the importance of rice as a&#13;
contributor of most nutrients is striking.&#13;
The estimation of income and price elasticities of demand for food&#13;
and nutrients is based on a household utility-maximization model from which&#13;
the household's demand for food and hence nutrients is derived. For&#13;
estimation purposes the double-logarithmic function is used, with quantities&#13;
of food, calories and nutrients as dependent variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Variations in household incomes and in family size and composition&#13;
are associated with marked variations in the quantities and patterns of food&#13;
consumption; however, corresponding changes in the consumption of nutrients&#13;
are much less dramatic. Thus the substitutions among food groups resulting&#13;
from changes in income and family size and composition are fairly efficient in&#13;
maintaining the nutritional intake of households.&#13;
The results concerning the effects of prices on food consumption&#13;
patterns are rather tentative, since these prices reflect in part qualitative&#13;
differences in food consumption which require further study. Nonetheless, it&#13;
is already apparent that a great deal of substitution takes place as prices&#13;
change.&#13;
The paper concludes that there is wide scope for nutrition policies&#13;
based on changes in incomes and relative prices, as food and nutrition&#13;
consumption respond rather dramatically to such changes. It is not clear at&#13;
this stage how households respond to income and price changes in terms of the&#13;
quality of foodstuffs they purchase, and what effect this has on nutrition.&#13;
As incomes rise, the dependency on rice increases as well. However, any&#13;
pricing policies designed to reduce this dependency must take into account the&#13;
evidence suggesting that no single food can substitute for rice as a major&#13;
source of most nutrients. The data also strongly suggest that inadequate&#13;
diets are prevalent among the better-off and the better-educated as well.&#13;
Hence, alleviating malnutrition in Indonesia is not just a matter of raising&#13;
levels of income but also of nutrition education.&#13;

ABREGE&#13;
Cette etude a pour objet d'6valuer le niveau de consommation&#13;
d'aliments et d'lements nutritifs de la population indonesienne; d'identifier&#13;
les groupes de population souffrant de carences nutritionnelles; d'identifier&#13;
les principales sources des divers e1lments nutritifs; et d'estimer les&#13;
elasticites - revenu et prix de la demande des aliments et des e1lments&#13;
nutritifs.&#13;
Les donn6es proviennent de l'Enquete socioeconomique nationale de&#13;
1978 (SUSENAS 1978) qui comportait des renseignements sur la quantit6 et le&#13;
prix de quelque 120 produits alimentaires consommes. La pr6sente etude donne&#13;
des estimations des aliments et e1lments nutritifs consommes oar les divers&#13;
groupes de population, ventilees par classe de depense des menages, region et&#13;
lieu de residence. On a calcul6 le pourcentage de la population souffrant de&#13;
carences nutritionnelles de diverses sortes en comparant la consommation&#13;
d'aliments, et donc indirectement celle d'elements nutritifs, de chaque m6nage&#13;
echantillon et les besoins de ce menage, compte tenu de sa composition par&#13;
age. Cette comparaison permet de conclure qu'en Indonesie il existe des&#13;
carences tres importantes de tous les elements nutritifs, mais qu'elles sont&#13;
dues plut6t a une mauvaise distribution qu'a une penurie generalisee de&#13;
produits alimentaires. D'une maniere generale, le probleme est plus grave a&#13;
Java que dans les autres iles et les menages pauvres sont plts touch6s que les&#13;
m6nages aises. Lorsque l'on etudie la source des divers elements nutritifs,&#13;
l'importance du riz est frappante.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pour evaluer les elasticit6s - revenu et prix de la demande&#13;
d'aliments et d'elements nutritifs, on a utilis6 un modele de maximisation&#13;
d'utilite des menages qui a permis de determiner la demande d'aliments et&#13;
donc d'elments nutritifs des menages. Aux fins du calcul, on a utilise&#13;
une fonction a double logarithme oii les quantites d'aliments, de calories&#13;
et d'elements nutritifs apparaissent comme variables dependantes.&#13;
Les variations des revenus des menages ainsi que de la taille et&#13;
de la composition de la famille vont de pair avec des variations notables&#13;
des quantites d'aliments et des habitudes de consommation; mais les&#13;
modifications correspondantes de la consommation d'6lements nutritifs sont&#13;
beaucoup moins marqu6es. Les substitutions entre les groupes d'aliments&#13;
permettent donc aux m6nages de maintenir de maniere relativement efficace&#13;
leur ration nutritive, quelque soit le revenu et la taille et la&#13;
composition de la famille.&#13;
Les conclusions portant sur les effets des prix sur les&#13;
habitudes de consommation sont relativement ambigues puisque ces prix sont&#13;
en partie le reflet de differences qualitatives, qui doivent etre 6tudiees&#13;
plus avant. 11 apparait neanmoins que les fluctuations des prix se&#13;
traduisent par des substitutions importantes.&#13;
La conclusion de cette etude est que l'on peut envisager un&#13;
eventail assez large de politiques nutritionnelles fondees sur des&#13;
modifications des revenus et des prix relatifs, puisque la consommation&#13;
d'aliments et d'6lements nutritifs repond de maniere spectaculaire a des&#13;
modifications de ce genre. On ne sait pas encore exactement les effets&#13;
que les modifications des revenus et des prix ont sur la qualite des&#13;
aliments achetes par les menages, et pour consequent, sur la nutrition. A&#13;
mesure que les revenus augmentent, les menages mangent de plus en plus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
de riz. Cependant toute politique des prix ayant pour objet de reduire&#13;
cette dependance doit tenir compte du fait qu'aucun produit ne peut&#13;
remplacer a lui seul le riz comme source d'elments nutritifs. Les&#13;
donnees recueillies semblent aussi sugg6rer que mime les r6gimes&#13;
alimentaires des menages aises et instruits sont mal equilibres. Pour&#13;
reduire la malnutrition en Indonesie, il ne faudra pas seulement relever&#13;
le niveau des revenus mais aussi celui de l'education alimentaire.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
La finalidad de este documento es estimar el nivel de consumo de&#13;
alimentos y nutrientes de la poblaci6n de Indonesia; identificar los&#13;
grupos de poblaci6n afectados por deficiencias de nutrientes; senialar las&#13;
fuentes principales de los diferentes nutrientes, y estimar 'La elasticidad&#13;
de la demanda de alimentos y de nutrientes tanto en funci6n *lel ingreso&#13;
como de los precios.&#13;
La fuente de datos utilizada es la Encuesta Socioecon6mica&#13;
Nacional de 1978 (SUSENAS 1978), que contiene informaci6n sobre las&#13;
cantidades consumidas de unos 120 articulos alimentarios y sobre los&#13;
gastos correspondientes. Se presentan estimaciones del consumno de&#13;
alimentos y nutrientes de diferentes grupos de poblaci6n, deE;glosadas por&#13;
categoria de gastos familiares, por regi6n y por zona de residencia. La&#13;
proporci6n de la poblaci6n afectada por deficiencias de diferentes&#13;
nutrientes se ha estimado comparando el consumo de alimentos y el consumo&#13;
implicito de nutrientes de cada familia de la muestra con las. necesidades&#13;
reales de la familia, teniendo en cuenta la composici6n de la. misma por&#13;
edades. La conclusi6n a que se liega es que en Indonesia hay graves&#13;
deficiencias de todos los nutrientes y que este problema radica mas en la&#13;
mala distribuci6n que en la insuficiente disponibilidad de alimentos en&#13;
general. El problema suele ser mas serio en Java que en las islas&#13;
exteriores y afecta en mayor grado a las familias mas pobres que a las mas&#13;
pudientes. Al examinar los origenes de los diversos nutrientes es muy&#13;
notable el predominio del arroz como elemento participante de muchos de&#13;
ellos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
La estimaci6n de la demanda de alimentos y nutrientes en funci6n&#13;
del ingreso y de los precios se basa en un modelo de maximizaci6n de la&#13;
utilidad familiar del que se deriva la demanda de alimentos y, por tanto,&#13;
de nutrientes de la familia. Para elaborar la estimaci6n se ha usado la&#13;
funci6n logaritmica doble, tomando como variables dependientes las&#13;
cantidades de alimentos, calorias y nutrientes.&#13;
Las variaciones en los ingresos familiares y en el tamaiio y&#13;
composici6n de la familia dan lugar a marcadas variaciones de la cantidad&#13;
y modalidad de consumo de alimentos, pero las modificaciones&#13;
correspondientes del consumo de nutrientes son mucho menos marcadas. Asi,&#13;
las sustituciones entre grupos de alimentos resultantes de las variaciones&#13;
del ingreso y del tamanio y composici6n de la familia contribuyen en forma&#13;
bastante eficiente a mantener el nivel de ingesti6n de nutrientes de las&#13;
familias.&#13;
Los resultados concernientes a los efectos de los precios en la&#13;
modalidad de consumo de alimentos son bastante tentativos, dado que estos&#13;
precios reflejan en parte diferencias cualitativas del consumo que exigen&#13;
un estudio mias a fondo. No obstante, ya es evidente que a medida que los&#13;
precios varian tiene lugar una considerable sustituci6n de alimentos.&#13;
En el documento se llega a la conclusi6n de que hay amplio&#13;
margen para adoptar politicas nutricionales basadas en las variaciones de&#13;
los ingresos y de los precios relativos, dado que el consumo de alimentos&#13;
y la nutrici6n reaccionan en grado bastante espectacular a esas&#13;
variaciones. En la actualidad no se sabe exactamente c6mo reaccionan las&#13;
familias ante las variaciones de los ingresos y los precios en cuanto a la&#13;
calidad de los productos que compran, ni que efecto tiene esto en la&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
nutrici6n.  Cuando los ingresos aumentan, tambi6n aumenta la, dependencia&#13;
del arroz. Sin embargo, cualquier politica de precios tendiente a reducir&#13;
esa dependencia debe tener en cuenta los datos que indican que ningun&#13;
alimento, por si solo, puede sustituir al arroz como una de las&#13;
principales fuentes de la mayoria de los nutrientes. Ademas, los datos&#13;
senialan claramente que las dietas inadecuadas tambien prevalecen entre los&#13;
grupos de mayores recursos y nivel de instrucci6n. Por lo tanto, para&#13;
aliviar el problema de la malnutrici6n en Indonesia no s6lo se requiere&#13;
elevar el nivel de ingresos sino tambien mejorar la educaci6on en la esfera&#13;
de la nutricion.&#13;

Patterns of Food Consumption and Nutrition in Indonesia&#13;
Dov Chernichovsky&#13;

I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
Indonesia is generally thought to have a nutrition problem among its&#13;
population which, until recently, has been associated with shortages of rice,&#13;
Indonesia's basic staple. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the&#13;
United Nations has estimated that the nutritional status of a significant&#13;
portion of the population, especially of children, is below standard. -&#13;
Along with basic calorie and protein deficiencies, micronutrient deficiencies&#13;
of vitamin A, iodine and iron are also believed to be prevalent.&#13;
Because of lack of suitable data, no direct link has yet been esta-&#13;
blished between mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status, on the one hand,&#13;
and food consumption, nutrition, and income, on the other. 2/ The problem of&#13;
malnutrition in Indonesia can be traced to poverty and lack of education on&#13;
2/   Only scanty information is available on this matter.    See S. Tabor,&#13;
"SUSENAS V - Preliminary Evaluation of Consumption Trends and Nutritional&#13;
Status", mimeo, USDA, Washington D.C., 1979; T.J. Ho, "Economic Status and&#13;
Nutrition in East Java", World Bank, Washington D.C., mimeo.&#13;
3/ See T.J. Ho, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
nutrition. It is compounded by a high degree of dependence on rice, of which&#13;
Indonesia is a major consumer and thus can influence the worLd price.&#13;
The above state of affairs has led to the formulation of three major&#13;
policy objectives: -&#13;
(i)     An overall increase in both the production and consumption of&#13;
food.&#13;
(ii)    Diversification of the diet to avoid excessive reliance on any one&#13;
staple, particularly rice.&#13;
(iii)   Stabilization of food consumption of vulnerable groups: the poor,&#13;
pregnant and lactating women, and children.&#13;
As far as the first policy objective goes, Indonesin has made sub-&#13;
stantial gains in food production. The production of rice has increased at&#13;
about 4.0% per annum over the last decade, while population qrew at about 2.4%&#13;
per annum, implying an increase in the average per capita consumption of&#13;
domestically-produced rice. At the same time, however, the reliance on rice&#13;
as the major staple increased; it represented 72% of total staple consumption&#13;
in 1980, compared with 68% during the 1970-75 period. This wras probably&#13;
related to changes in incomes and the pricing policies of the: 1970's in which&#13;
the price of rice was kept low relative to the prices of other major staples&#13;
such as cassava, wheat and corn.&#13;
It has been pointed out that total food availability in Indonesia is&#13;
now more than sufficient to meet average nutrition requirements of the popu-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
lation. 1/ How this increase in total food availability translates into&#13;
improvements in food and nutrient intake depends on its distribution among the&#13;
population.&#13;
The effect of changes in incomes and relative prices as a result of&#13;
improvement in food production on the consumption levels and patterns of dif-&#13;
ferent population groups is a critical issue in the design of food policies&#13;
and programs. The issue relates to the households' decision-making process&#13;
insofar as it affects nutritional intake. The response of households to&#13;
changing opportunities may well be inconsistent with the basic policy objec-&#13;
tives and with the improvement in the level of welfare of the population as&#13;
perceived by the policy makers.&#13;
The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between food&#13;
and nutrient consumption and household characteristics in Indonesia. It is&#13;
proposed to estimate the level of consumption of food and nutrients for the&#13;
population; to identify population groups with nutrient deficiencies; to iden-&#13;
tify the major sources of different nutrients; and to estimate income and&#13;
price elasticities of demand for both foods and nutrients.&#13;
The data source for the study is the National Socio-Economic Survey&#13;
for 1978 (SUSENAS 1978). The next section gives details of the data set and&#13;
presents estimates of food and nutrient consumption of different population&#13;
groups, with breakdowns by household expenditure class, region, area of resi-&#13;
dence, and whether the household is deficient in calories, protein and vitamin&#13;
A. The estimates are available for different seasons of the year and these&#13;
are shown as well. In addition, this descriptive material is used to identify&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the groups with consumption of nutrients below the recommended levels and&#13;
hence are most vulnerable to nutrition-related problems.&#13;
Section III gives some conceptual and analytical considerations which&#13;
are followed in Section IV by estimates of income and price elasticities of&#13;
demand for foods and nutrients, information which would be critical for the&#13;
design of income and price policies to improve food consumption patterns and&#13;
the level and pattern of nutrition in Indonesia.&#13;
II. THE DATA AND THE SETTING&#13;
2.1 The Data&#13;
The data used in this study are from the data tapes of the National&#13;
Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics&#13;
in 1978. The survey was carried out in four rounds each covering a three-&#13;
month period; these were centered around February, May, August, and&#13;
November. The sample size was over 6,300 households in each round, with a&#13;
total for all four rounds of over 25,000 households. Each observation of each&#13;
of the subsamples is treated separately in this study. .1 This approach&#13;
combines the panel characteristics of the data that are important for&#13;
variations in prices, with cross-sectional properties. The basic&#13;
characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1.&#13;
The regional and urban/rural distributions of the sample, shown in&#13;
columns 1 and 2, are almost identical to those of the 1971 Population Census&#13;
and the 1976 Intercensal Population Survey. Nearly two-thirds of the&#13;
2/    Because of problems with the data tape for the August round, only the&#13;
remaining three rounds were used in the analysis. According]y, figures&#13;
showing average values are averages for the three rounds only.&#13;

population are concentrated on Java. outside of the capital city of Jakarta,&#13;
most of the remainder of Java is classified as rural. Rural areas contain a&#13;
slightly smaller proportion of the total population in the Outer Islands. The&#13;
SUSENAS sample thus provides a representative geographical distribution of the&#13;
population of Indonesia.&#13;
Average household size, shown in column 3, is 4.6 persons overall.&#13;
Javanese families tend to be smaller than families in the Outer Islands. This&#13;
phenomenon, associated with Java's relatively low fertility rate, is consis-&#13;
tent with the figures in column 4, which show a higher proportion of persons&#13;
age 10 and above in Java than in the Outer Islands. 2/&#13;
Household monthly consumption expenditure will be the basic welfare&#13;
indicator used in this study. Column 5 presents this indicator which varies&#13;
substantially from around Rp 17,000 in Central Java to over Rp 30,000 in&#13;
Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Jakarta shows a very high average expen-&#13;
diture. Likewise Maluku and Irian Jaya where the urban population is overre-&#13;
presented in the sample. Average monthly expenditures are lower in Java than&#13;
in the Outer Islands, and they also show more variation. This is further&#13;
shown in Table 2 in which expenditure ranges are given which divide households&#13;
into the lower 40%, middle 30% and upper 30%. The classification is done&#13;

separately for Java and the Outer Islands; it can be seen that the bottom 40%&#13;
in the Outer Islands is more "affluent" than that in Java.&#13;
2.2 The Setting&#13;
The data, of which we use the months of February, Miy and November,&#13;
provide information on the quantities of, and expenditures on, approximately&#13;
120 food items. lb simplify the discussion, we have grouped similar food&#13;
items into thirteen major groups as follows: rice, corn, wheat, cassava,&#13;
potatoes, fish, meat and poultry, eggs, dairy products, vegetables, legumes,&#13;
fruits, and other. An attempt was made to keep the items in each group as&#13;
homogeneous as possible except that the last category is basically a residual&#13;
one, containing those items not found in any other group. 1/ However, the&#13;
nutritional values of foods were calculated on the basis of individual food&#13;
items. ./  An adjustment was made for food and nutrient consumption from "food.&#13;
and beverages outside the home" based on the household's exptnditures on these&#13;
in relation to the expenditures on food consumed at home.&#13;
Price information was not explicitly available in the data. Average&#13;
implicit prices were obtained by dividing the expenditure on any particular&#13;
item by its quantity (whenever positive values and quantitie3 were&#13;
reported.) This issue will be discussed further in the next section.&#13;
2.   For a detailed list of items in each food group, see Annex 1.&#13;
2/ The conversion was based on two highly consistent sourcen: United States&#13;
Department of Agriculture, Nutritive Value of Foods, Home Garden Bulletin No.&#13;
72, Washington D.C., 1971 and FAQ and USHEW, Food Composition Tables for Use&#13;
in South East Asia, Washington D.C., 1972.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.2.1 Food Consumption Patterns&#13;
The shares of expenditures on major consumption categories in total&#13;
household expenditures are shown in Table 3. On average 68% of the house-&#13;
hold's total expenditures are spent on food. Across regions, Jakarta has the&#13;
lowest food share and Kalimantan the highest. The rural population spends&#13;
relatively more on food than the urban population, an indication of the&#13;
relative affluence of the urban dwellers. Seasonality does not have much&#13;
effect on the food share.&#13;
As expected, the food share falls with. rising incomes. While the&#13;
poorest 40% of households allocate 73% of their total expenditures to food,&#13;
the richest 30% allocate 59%. It is possible that the latter figure is an&#13;
overestimate if the upper income groups underreport nonfood expenditures.&#13;
Table 3 shows the variations in the allocation of the household&#13;
budget to different expenditure categories with rising incomes. The budget&#13;
shares of all nonfood categories generally, and in particular "goods and&#13;
services", "durable goods', schooling and health-related expenditures which&#13;
are "luxury items", increase with rising total expenditures.&#13;
Table 4 gives the proportions of the household food budget allocated&#13;
to each food group. For the total population, rice accounts for one-third of&#13;
total food expenditures, other staples for another 7%; fish, meat and poultry&#13;
for 9%; eggs and dairy products for 2%; vegetables, legumes, and fruits for&#13;
13%; and other items which include oil, butter, sugar, bread and drinks for&#13;
the remaining 35%.&#13;

The urban population spends proportionately less on rice, corn, and&#13;
cassava (the main staples) than does the rural population, and more on meat&#13;
and poultry, eggs, milk, legumes, fruits, and "other' foods. Similarly, the&#13;
lower 40% allocates more of its budget to the staple foods than do the other&#13;
expenditure groups, while the upper 30% spends relatively more on fish, meat&#13;
and poultry, eggs, milk, and "other" foods. Within staples, the rural&#13;
population spends a smaller proportion on rice and larger proportions on corn&#13;
and cassava. The share of staples in the food budget declines while the share&#13;
of rice within the staple group increases with rising incomes. This has clear&#13;
implications for the aggregate demand of these major crops with rising incomes&#13;
over time, and is consistent with the observed rising dependence on rice in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
Some minor variations in the pattern of food consumption can be seen&#13;
by season. For example, less is spent on rice and more on corn and wheat in&#13;
February compared with November.&#13;
The major differences in the pattern of food expenditures are across&#13;
regions. For example, the share of rice in the total food budget ranges from&#13;
17% in M4aluku and Irian Jaya to 44% in West Java, while the share of cassava&#13;
ranges from close to zero in Jakarta to 5% in Maluku and Irian Jaya. In all&#13;
major food groups there are substantial variations across regions.&#13;
A comparison between the population groups defined according to&#13;
whether or not they are deficient in different nutrients shows that those&#13;
groups which are deficient in calories and protein spend higher proportions of&#13;
their food budgets on staples, such as rice and corn, and lower proportions on&#13;
fish, meat and poultry, eggs and dairy products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Table 5 shows the proportion of the population reporting some expen-&#13;
diture on each food group. Rice, vegetables, and "other" food items are&#13;
consumed by the vast majority of the population. A substantial proportion of&#13;
the population also reports consumption of fish, legumes, and fruits. Wheat&#13;
and dairy products are reportedly consumed by only 8% and 14% of the&#13;
population respectively.&#13;
For most food groups, consumption is reported by a larger proportion&#13;
of the urban population than of the rural population. Thus the urban popula-&#13;
tion has on average a more varied diet, one which includes food items from a&#13;
larger number of food groups, compared with the rural population. The excep-&#13;
tions to this are corn and cassava. Corn is consumed by 26% of the rural&#13;
population compared with 9% of the urban population; and 47% of the rural&#13;
population consume cassava compared with 33% of those in urban areas.&#13;
As expected, additional income is associated with a greater likeli-&#13;
hood of consuming most foods. Corn, however, appears to be an inferior good;&#13;
the higher the expenditure group, the lower the proportion of the population&#13;
that consumes it. A larger proportion of the population who are deficient in&#13;
calories, protein and vitamin A consume corn than those who do not have these&#13;
deficiencies.&#13;
One should also note the exceptionally low proportion of households&#13;
in Central Java and Yogyakarta reporting consumption of fish, meat and&#13;
poultry, and dairy products.&#13;
For households reporting consumption, Table 6 shows per capita daily&#13;
consumption in grams (except for eggs which are given in units) of the various&#13;
food groups by region. Consumption of foods seems to be more similar among&#13;
the population of the Outer Islands than among the Javanese. For example, per&#13;

capita daily consumption of cassava, a main staple, ranges from 47 grams in&#13;
Jakarta to 209 grams in Central Java, while in the outer Islands the range is&#13;
much smaller, from 150 grams in Sulawesi to 258 grams in Maluku and Irian&#13;
Jaya. Overall, consumption is higher in the Outer Islands, particularly in&#13;
Bali, and Maluku and Irian Jaya. Of course Table 6 has to be interpreted in&#13;
conjunction with Table 4 which shows the proportions of households reporting&#13;
consumption of different food groups.&#13;
There is no significant difference between the urban and rural con-&#13;
sumption of rice, the major staple, or of fish and "other' food items.&#13;
However, of the households reporting consumption, the rural population con-&#13;
sumes more of most other food groups, with the exception of milk, legumes, and&#13;
eggs. Consumption of meat, while higher in rural areas of the Outer Islands,&#13;
is consumed in similar quantities in urban and rural areas on Java. Finally,&#13;
fruits are consumed in larger quantities in the urban areas of Java and in the&#13;
rural areas of the Outer Islands.&#13;
For most foods, no pronounced seasonal variations in consumption are&#13;
apparent. A very general pattern emerges for corn, wheat, fish and "other"&#13;
foods: consumption is highest in February and lowest in November.&#13;
Consumption of vegetables also appears to be at its lowest in November.&#13;
Clearly, households which are deficient in calories and protein&#13;
consume less rice, by margins of about 40%, than those which are not. The&#13;
former rely more on corn, but the difference in per capita consumption levels&#13;
is small. Households poor in calories also report lower consumption of&#13;
cassava and potatoes. Vitamin A deficiency appears to be associated with&#13;
relatively low consumption levels of potatoes, fish, dairy products, vege-&#13;
tables, legumes and fruits.&#13;

2.2.2 Food Prices&#13;
The SUSENAS data were collected in both urban and rural areas in all&#13;
the provinces of Indonesia. Moreover, the survey was conducted in four rounds&#13;
during different seasons of the year. Variations in food prices across&#13;
regions and seasons will be used in this paper to derive price elasticities of&#13;
demand for foods and nutrients.&#13;
The implied price for each food group was calculated by dividing&#13;
total consumption expenditure on each group by the total quantity of the&#13;
group. The results are shown in Table 7.&#13;
Residents of Jakarta and Maluku and Irian Jaya face the highest&#13;
prices for most food groups, while prices are lowest in Central Java and&#13;
Bali. The exception to this is the "other" foods category which shows the&#13;
highest average price in Central Java and moderate prices in Maluku and Irian&#13;
Jaya.&#13;
Prices are generally higher in urban than in rural areas. There are&#13;
no significant seasonal price variations for most food groups, although a few&#13;
exhibit very general patterns. The price of cassava is highest in February,&#13;
while the prices of corn, fish, meat and legumes are highest in November.&#13;
As would be expected, rich households pay higher prices for all&#13;
foods. This is also reflected in the price differences between population&#13;
groups with and without nutrient deficiencies. However, the calorie-deficient&#13;
population pays a somewhat higher price for rice compared with that without&#13;
the deficiency.&#13;

2.2.3 Consumption of Calories and other Nutrients&#13;
Per capita daily consumption of different nutrients is shown in Table&#13;
8 which essentially summarizes all the differences shown in previous&#13;
tables. -! Consumption of nutrients is generally higher in the Outer Islands&#13;
than in Java. The residents of Sumatra and Kalimantan show especially high&#13;
intakes of nutrients, while the residents of Central Java and Yogyakarta have&#13;
relatively lower intakes. The population of Sulawesi apparently consumes less&#13;
calcium and vitamin C than elsewhere.&#13;
Overall, the consumption of nutrients does not vary significantly&#13;
between urban and rural areas. Consumption of fat is slightly higher in urban&#13;
areas, while the consumption of calories, carbohydrates and vitamin C is&#13;
higher in rural areas. Protein and vitamin A consumptions are higher in the&#13;
urban areas than in rural areas of Java; the reverse holds in the Outer&#13;
Islands.&#13;
There are no significant seasonal variations in the intakes of&#13;
different nutrients.&#13;
2.2.4 Deficiencies in Calories and Other Nutrients&#13;
The estimated per capita daily consumption of nutrients given in&#13;
Tables 8 can be compared with estimated minimal requirements reported in&#13;
.1/ The reader should note that these consumption levels are derived from&#13;
information on purchased foods. The impact of the level of income/expendi-&#13;
tures is evident across the board. The higher the levels of household expen-&#13;
ditures, the higher the level of consumption of nutrients. The figures&#13;
suggest that households deficient in calories and protein are also likely to&#13;
be deficient in other nutrients. The differences between purchases and actual&#13;
intakes may be substantial for a variety of reasons.&#13;

Table 9. These requirements have been set for three broad age categories,&#13;
namely individuals under 5, between 5 and 10, and 10 and over, according to&#13;
tables calculated for the Indonesian population. 1/ The average requirements&#13;
were set for each age group. An additional 15% of the average was added to&#13;
the minimum to allow for pregnant and lactating women. For calories, the&#13;
minimal requirements are as follows:&#13;
Age Grou                     Minimal Daily Caloric Requirement&#13;
Under 5                                    1166&#13;
5-9                                        1654&#13;
10 and over                                2126&#13;
The minimal per capita daily requirement of calories for a region,&#13;
for example, would be the average requirement which takes into account the&#13;
distribution of the population among the three age categories listed above.&#13;
Thus a region with a relatively high proportion of children would have a&#13;
relatively low minimal average requirement. Table 9 gives the estimated&#13;
minimal per capita daily requirements of nutrients by region. We can see that&#13;
the provinces of Java, which have higher proportions of the population in the&#13;
age group 10 and over compared with the Outer Islands, also have higher&#13;
average requirements of calories, as would be expected.&#13;

To continue to discuss caloric requirements, deficiencies in the&#13;
consumption of calories can come about because the average consumption falls&#13;
short of the average requirement and, in addition, because whatever calories&#13;
are available are not distributed according to requirements. The first says&#13;
that there are not enough total calories to satisfy everyone's minimal&#13;
requirements. The second says that, even if there are enough calories in the&#13;
aggregate, because some people are consuming more than their minimal require-&#13;
ments, there are others who do not consume enough to satisfy their require-&#13;
ments. Comparing Tables 8 and 9, the estimated total availability of calories&#13;
in Indonesia comes to 104% of what would be required to meet everyone's&#13;
needs.1/ However, when the comparison is made on a regional basis, we see&#13;
that there is a problem of aggregate availability of calories in all the&#13;
provinces of Java, as well as a slight shortfall in Maluku and Irian Jaya,&#13;
whereas there are more calories than the estimated requirements in all the&#13;
other regions in the Outer Islands.&#13;
This suggests that there may be quite a serious problem of caloric&#13;
deficiency in Java. In Central Java and Yogyakarta, the available calories&#13;
come to only 82% and 77% of what would be required. If those in Yogyakarta&#13;
who do not have a deficiency consume exactly their minimal requirement of&#13;
calories and no more, while those with a deficiency consume on average 1,300&#13;
calories (87% of the average), then 70% of the population would have a defi-&#13;
ciency in calories.&#13;
The optimistic aggregate picture in the Outer Islands does not imply&#13;
that there would be no deficiencies in calories there. As pointed out&#13;
earlier, distributional problems would mean deficiencies for some. The data&#13;
1/    This compares with an estimate of daily per capita calorie supply of&#13;
2,272 calories in 1977, or 102% of requirement, given in the World&#13;
Development Report 1982.&#13;

for the Outer Islands are aggregated into major islands; there could be a&#13;
great deal of variation.among the provinces within each one.&#13;
Estimates of the proportion of the population with deficiencies in&#13;
different nutrients are given in Table 10. These estimates are obtained on a&#13;
case-by-case basis for all the sample households so that the household's food&#13;
consumption and the implied nutrient consumption are measured against the&#13;
household's own requirements, given its age distribution. Note that an&#13;
implicit assumption is made that there are no distributional problems within&#13;
the household; that is, if the household total requirement for a nutrient is&#13;
met, then all the household members are considered to have satisfied their&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2.2.5    Profiles of Populations Deficient in Calories, Protein and Vitamin A&#13;
The data presented thus far show considerable variations in food and&#13;
nutrition consumption patterns across regions, locations (urban/rural) and by&#13;
income class. The next step requires an explicit association between consump-&#13;
tion patterns, market conditions and household characteristics. In this sec-&#13;
tion we address the basic characteristics distinguishing households which meet&#13;
minimal requirements in calories, protein and vitamin A, and those which do&#13;
not. Such a distinction, combined with the regional differences discussed&#13;
before, may help in the formulation of policies aimed at target groups defined&#13;
according to some broad population characteristics.&#13;
Tables 11, 12, and 13 give a comparison of the characteristics of&#13;
households meeting calorie, protein and vitamin A requirements, and households&#13;
which do not. In both Java and the Outer Islands, the most significant dis-&#13;
criminating factor between the two groups is household monthly expenditures.&#13;
Moreover, households with deficiencies are larger than those without them.&#13;

Th expenditure and household size differences between Java and the Outer&#13;
Islands suggest that in the Outer Islands the presence of deficicies, in&#13;
calorie consumption in particular, may be more related to poverty than in&#13;
Java.&#13;
Education is a discriminating factor between the calorie-deficient&#13;
and nondeficient populations in Java, but not in the Outer Islands. In the&#13;
latter region, education is more significant in explaining the consumption of&#13;
protein and vitamin A. The finding of the relative insignificance of educa-&#13;
tion in the consumption of calories in the Outer Islands supports the notion&#13;
that in these islands poverty may be the key issue, while in Java other fac-&#13;
tors may be important as well.&#13;
Households are also classified by their sources of income. In&#13;
general, the likelihood of households with incomes from industry and agricul-&#13;
ture failing to meet minimal nutritional requirements is smaller than those&#13;
with incomes from other sources. Surprisingly, we find that a household&#13;
reporting income from government employment is more likely to be deficient in&#13;
each of the nutrients compared with a household not reporting any income from&#13;
this source. A major difference between Java and the Outer Islands is that in&#13;
the Outer Islands a household reporting income from agriculture is more likely&#13;
to be deficient in calories than otherwise; the opposite holds for Java.&#13;
This last point is probably reflected in the rural/urban differen-&#13;
tials. Rural households are more likely to be better-off in terms of nutri-&#13;
tion in Java, and worse off in terms of vitamin A in the Outer Islands.&#13;
Next, we turn to the determination of the specific causes of varia-&#13;
tions in food consumption and nutrition. This may help in understanding how&#13;
households have become deficient in nutrients and in selecting policy instru-&#13;
ments to alleviate the situation.&#13;

III.     CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
In this section, we outline some basic theoretical and practical&#13;
considerations which will guide us in dealing further with the data described&#13;
in the previous section. Our basic objective here is to estimate marginal&#13;
propensities to consume and demand elasticities for various foods and nu-&#13;
trients. These elasticities are the best available indicators of how house-&#13;
holds may respond to policies which change relative prices and the level and&#13;
distribution of income. In addition, we wish to examine the effects of other&#13;
variables, primarily household size and composition, education of the spouse&#13;
of the household head (presumed to be the homemaker), as well as sources of&#13;
income. These variables are believed to be critical in the determination of&#13;
food and nutrition consumption but are not readily amenable to policy&#13;
interventions. 1/&#13;
We assume that households operate in a competitive food market and&#13;
that "foods" constitute a (weakly) separable branch of the household's utility&#13;
function which is identical for all households. This particular branch can be&#13;
expressed either as a function of a vector of n food items, F., denoting both&#13;
type and quantity,&#13;
u  =   u (F1, F2, ...... 0, Fn&#13;
or as a function of m nutrients (m &lt; n) which are a linear transformation of foods&#13;
through a matrix containing n x m coefficients aij (i=1, ....,n; j=1,...., m)&#13;
1/   On the relevance and use of elasticity estimates for policy options, see&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
which transform foods into nutrients. That is:&#13;
1/&#13;
t1= u'(N1, N 2'      Nm                     (2)&#13;
This assumption permits us to treat food or nutrient consumption as&#13;
if the household preallocates a particular budget to foods before entering the&#13;
market and maximizes its utility subject to this budget preallocation.&#13;
Furthermore, we assume that the household does not increase or decrease con-&#13;
sumption of particular foods and nutrients with changes in the consumption of&#13;
other "nonfood' goods and services, unless these changes affect its budget&#13;
allocation to food. This general approach is supported by the relatively high&#13;
shares of food in the household budget.&#13;
Hence, we may a priori consider the family's relevant budget con-&#13;
straint as its expenditures on food (Ef). We thus have a basic demand system&#13;
with n equations of the type:&#13;
Fi =fi(P" P21        *' Pn' Ef, R)            (3)&#13;
where (P1, P21 . . ., Pn) is a vector of food prices and R is a set of&#13;
relevant control variables which are discussed below. The implied "demand"&#13;
for nutrients is thus&#13;
N   =  gj (P1, P2, *   * .  n' Ef, R).         (4)&#13;
.1/   We do not explicitly discuss here the different approaches possible.     We&#13;
might also consider that equation (1) is derived from equation (2). That is,&#13;
we assume that a sophisticated consumer's demand for foods is derived from his&#13;
demand for a particular diet. See Lancaster (1966) for a theoretical discus-&#13;
sion and Chernichovsky (1977) for an application of this. The arguments in&#13;
(1) and (2) can be put in per capita or per adult-equivalent terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
As the demand for (and consumption of) nutrients is the prime concern&#13;
of this paper, we shall focus on a few important parameters. The implicit&#13;
demand for each nutrient, N., (j = 1, 2, . . ., m), is a linear tranformation&#13;
of the entire foods vector:&#13;
n&#13;
N. = z a$.F&#13;
N .     ij Fi&#13;
1 =1 &#13;
where ac. is a coefficient transforming a particular quantity of food Fi into&#13;
a certain quantity of nutrient, Nj. This tranformation implies that the&#13;
sensitivity of demand for a particular nutrient to a change in income or&#13;
expenditures, its income or expenditure elasticity n, is&#13;
n  c &#13;
nNiE     $-1    j     iFnE                                   (6)&#13;
Correspondingly, the relevant price elasticity of demand with respect to a&#13;
particular price, say P1, is&#13;
n  a  Fi&#13;
NjP1    $-     iJ                                           (7)&#13;
NiP          N.       FP&#13;
Equations (5) and (6) indicate that the impact of changes in income&#13;
and price on the consumption of nutrient Nj is a function of the share of each&#13;
particular food item Fi in the total consumption of this nutrient&#13;
(kij       N i  i ) and of the income and price elasticities of that food.&#13;
I&#13;
Relationships (6) and (7) are of particular interest. They signify&#13;
that the effect of a change in income or in price Pi on the consumption of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
particular nutrient is a function of the impact of the change on the entire&#13;
food basket. It is not at all clear, a priori, how a particular change will&#13;
affect the consumption of particular nutrients, unless we know the income and&#13;
price elasticities for each food as well as its share in the consumption of&#13;
each nutrient, kij.&#13;
It is thus clear that, with a change in incomes or relative prices,&#13;
the resulting change in consumption of foods with low income or price&#13;
elasticities may have a significant impact on the consumption of a particular&#13;
nutrient, Nj, if these foods are significant sources of that nutrient. By the&#13;
same token, the resulting change in the consumption of foods with a low con-&#13;
tribution to N. may also have a significant impact on the consumption of Nil&#13;
if these foods have high income or price elasticities of demand.&#13;
These general considerations emphasize the significance of our&#13;
empirical analysis, which must deal with both income and price elasticities,&#13;
as well as the shares of particular foods in the consumption of nutrients&#13;
(k.)&#13;
ij -&#13;
Next we turn to some basic empirical and computational considera-&#13;
tions. First, we deal with the definitions of the relevant variables. As&#13;
indicated in the previous section, foods have been grouped into 13 major cate-&#13;
gories. In relation to this grouping, prices present a serious conceptual and&#13;
empirical problem. As price information is not directly available in the&#13;
data, which give only the total expenditure on, and the quantity of, each food&#13;
item, prices have had to be defined as the average expenditure per item for&#13;
the group (Pi = Ei/Fi). This average implicit price does not necessarily&#13;
represent the marginal price that consumers face, but is the only information&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
For those households reporting no expenditure at all on a particular&#13;
item, a local average price was assigned on the assumption that each household&#13;
faces an average price common to its area at any given time. 1/&#13;
Hence any given price (Pi) is defined as the total expenditure on a&#13;
particular group consisting of k items, divided by total quantities, measured&#13;
in homogeneous units, in this group. Hence,&#13;
k&#13;
E =            k   __ __ __                               (8)&#13;
i    k              2.   k&#13;
Q-1 QQ              Q-E_1 RE&#13;
which is a weighted average price per kilogram of a group of foods. The&#13;
weights are the quantity shares of each food in the group. The price thus&#13;
becomes a function not only of the average individual prices of foods, but&#13;
also of the relative quantities consumed within each food category. As a&#13;
result, households buying more expensive items face higher group prices.&#13;
The discussion of prices leads to Theil's notion of a quality-&#13;
quantity trade-off that may be particularly relevant here (Theil 1952). We&#13;
assume that items within each group are close substitutes, and that people&#13;
1/   To make the computation practical for each region (defined previously),&#13;
we estimated separately for Java and the outer Islands:&#13;
K               M&#13;
p  =  p0 + E a.d. + ad   + E ykdk+ V&#13;
g     g   i=1         u IklYk= k&#13;
where Pg is the average price of a group; di are dummy variables representing&#13;
K subregions; d u is a dummy variable representing urban location; and dk are&#13;
dummy variables representing the different months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
prefer one item to another because of various qualitative differences, mani-&#13;
fested in prices. As wealthier households tend to buy more expensive foods,&#13;
the group price becomes a function of household income and other household&#13;
characteristics such as size, composition, etc. 1/&#13;
From the relationships discussed thus far, we can also derive an&#13;
implicit price of a nutrient. When foods are measured in identical units, say&#13;
kilograms, and each food (group) has a price P per kilogram, one can define&#13;
the following:&#13;
N&#13;
N.  i- 1i  ij&#13;
= 1&#13;
pN is thus the price of nutrient j coming from a kilogram of a particular&#13;
basket of food. This price is seen to be a function of all previous&#13;
variables: the relative contribution of various foods to any particular&#13;
nutrient; the particular mix of food groups in any given diet; the particular&#13;
composition of any food group; and of course food prices.   This measure (PN.&#13;
can be used as a general indicator of efficiency in consumption with regard to&#13;
different nutrients, as it conveys the effects of compositional changes in the&#13;
food basket on costs of nutrients.&#13;
In this paper we focus on the quantitative aspects of consumption&#13;
which lead to actual consumption of nutrients. It should be noted that prices&#13;
for relatively highly aggregated groups, particularly meat and poultry, and&#13;
fruits and vegetables, may vary systematically with income/expenditures.&#13;
2.1   This general problem may already exist in the case of individual food&#13;
items; wealthier households may be paying higher average prices for them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
For empirical purposes, we use household monthly expenditures,&#13;
instead of just expenditures on food as advocated earlier by conceptual consi-&#13;
derations. The two variables are highly correlated and thus make almost no&#13;
difference from a statistical viewpoint. Furthermore, household expenditures&#13;
are commonly accepted as a good proxy for permanent income and come closer to&#13;
any operational concept of income.&#13;
Household size and composition enter the demand equation through the&#13;
numbers in three age groups: children 0-4, children 5-9 and members ages 10&#13;
and above.&#13;
13            3        4&#13;
Ln(F.) = Bo+ 8 Ln(E) + E O.Ln(P.) + E   y S + E 6kDk+ p   (9)&#13;
1     0   e        =1    1 3.  s=1      k=1kk&#13;
where    Fi = quantity of food of type i purchased&#13;
E = household monthly expenditure&#13;
Pi= price of commodity i&#13;
Ss = number of household members in age group s&#13;
Dk = dummy variable for education/source of income&#13;
An alternative reduced form of this function would replace Fi by&#13;
nutrients N. (j = 1,..., m).&#13;
)&#13;
Finally, we discuss the choice of functional form and the actual&#13;
estimation procedure. We have chosen the double-logarithmic function in&#13;
expenditures and prices. While the proposed function does not meet the&#13;
general restrictions applying to demand equations, its practical appeal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
its descriptive properties are overriding. -/   Similar analyses, (Alderman and&#13;
Timmer, 1980; Chernichovsky, 1977) point to the goodness of fit of this func-&#13;
tion. Food and nutrition consumption, as well as incomes, are known to have&#13;
skewed distributions; the logarithmic transformation brings them closer to&#13;
normality. Furthermore, since we are dealing with a full range of foods and&#13;
particularly of nutrients, it is efficient to obtain direct elasticities which&#13;
are independent of the units of measurements of quantities. The problem with&#13;
this function of forcing constant elasticities over the entire income/expen-&#13;
diture or price range is mitigated to some extent by confining part of the&#13;
discussion to the population deficient in calories, broken down by Java and&#13;
the Outer Islands.&#13;
IV.      SOURCES OF VARIATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR FOODS AND NUTRIENTS&#13;
In this section, we report and discuss the estimated income and price&#13;
elasticities of demand for foods and nutrients, as well as the effect of&#13;
household characteristics on consumption patterns. The analysis is done&#13;
separately for Java and the Outer Islands, and for households which are&#13;
deficient in calories.&#13;
4.1      Sources of Calories and Other Nutrients&#13;
As suggested earlier by the conceptual framework, a clearer under-&#13;
standing of how changes in incomes and relative prices affect the consumption&#13;
of nutrients requires an appreciation of the contributions of different foods&#13;
to the various nutrients. These are given for the lower 40% and upper 30%&#13;
21   Households with zero expenditure on any food item are assigned a value of&#13;
.001 in the regression analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
expenditure classes for Java and the Outer Islands in Tables 14 and 15.&#13;
Calories come primarily from rice, which also contributes substan-&#13;
tially to protein, carbohydrates, thiamine, iron, riboflavin, niacin and, to a&#13;
lesser extent, fat. Cassava and corn are also important contributors of&#13;
calories, especially among the poor in Java. Fish, legumes, fruits and&#13;
vegetables are other important nonrice sources. It is important to note that&#13;
the dependence on rice as a source of calories increases with income.&#13;
Next to rice, fish is an important source of protein, especially in&#13;
the Outer Islands. Other sources are vegetables and legumes. It is clear&#13;
from the tables that, as people get wealthier, they tend to get a larger&#13;
proportion of their protein from meat and poultry.&#13;
Fat comes in relatively substantial amounts from legumes and "other"&#13;
sources, which include various fish products, oils, and coconut. Again the&#13;
wealthier households tend to get a higher proportion of fat from "other"&#13;
products and meat, and less from rice and vegetables.&#13;
Carbohydrates come primarily from rice and cassava, as well as other&#13;
food products. To a lesser degree this is the case for corn among the poor.&#13;
For the poor, calcium comes primarily from cassava, vegetables and&#13;
legumes. Fish plays a major role as a source of calcium in the Outer&#13;
Islands. Similarly, iron comes primarily from vegetables, legumes and&#13;
cassava, especially in Java and among the poor. Fish is also important as a&#13;
source of iron in the Outer Islands.&#13;
Vitamin A comes primarily from fruits and vegetables, as well as corn&#13;
and potatoes. For the poor, corn is relatively more important, while for the&#13;
better-off, it is potatoes and fruits.&#13;

In addition to rice, the major sources of thiamine in Java are&#13;
vegetables and legumes. There are no noticeable differences between the two&#13;
major regions.&#13;
For riboflavin, vegetables again constitute a major source, next to&#13;
rice. However, there is a noticeable difference between Java and the outer&#13;
Islands; in the latter, fish contributes relatively more to this nutrient,&#13;
while legumes are more important in Java.&#13;
Niacin comes primarily from rice. In addition, it comes from&#13;
vegetables and fish in the Outer Islands, and from legumes and cassava in&#13;
Java.&#13;
Vitamin C is basically embodied in vegetables and fruits, as well as&#13;
in cassava. Fruits are more important for the rich than for the poor as a&#13;
source of vitamin C.&#13;
Given the importance of rice in the Indonesian diet, the intakes of&#13;
all nutrients except for calcium, vitamin A and vitamin C are bound to be very&#13;
sensitive to any changes in income and the price of rice, or any factor affec-&#13;
ting them, even if its own income and price elasticities are low. This will&#13;
be the case especially for the poor and in Java, where rice is a basic staple,&#13;
accounting for a substantial portion of total household expenditures on food.&#13;
For similar reasons, but to a lesser extent, the prices of cassava&#13;
and vegetables are particularly important in Java. Fish is significant in the&#13;
outer Islands, and so are legumes in Java as major sources of almost all other&#13;
micronutrients.&#13;

- 44 -&#13;
class; separate parameter estimates are given for the population deficient in&#13;
calories.&#13;
Among the staples, including potatoes, it is clear that rice, the&#13;
major staple, has the highest income elasticity of demand among low-income&#13;
groups in both Java and the Outer Islands. This is particularly true for&#13;
Java, where the lower 40% expenditure group is poorer than in the Outer&#13;
Islands. On the other hand, among the higher-expenditure groups we find&#13;
higher expenditure elasticities for corn, wheat, and potatoes.    This under-&#13;
lines the fact that these staples are consumed by the higher-income groups.&#13;
Cassava consumption appears not to respond to any changes in income in both&#13;
regions. The calorie-deficient population in Java appears, with regard to&#13;
consumption of rice and corn, to have the attributes of the middle income&#13;
group. It has a relatively high price elasticity for rice and a low one for&#13;
cassava.&#13;
These estimates show that, as household total expenditure increases,&#13;
people at low incomes increase rice consumption and eventually switch to some&#13;
corn, wheat and potatoes. The calorie-deficient population is inclined to&#13;
increase their consumption of rice and wheat with rising incomes, and not the&#13;
consumption of corn and cassava in Java. Cassava appears more appealing to&#13;
the calorie-deficient population in the Outer Islands.&#13;
Among the major sources of protein, namely fish, meat, poultry, milk,&#13;
eggs, and legumes we find relatively high income elasticities of demand for&#13;
fish and legumes among the lower income groups, and for meat, poultry, dairy&#13;
products and eggs, the more expensive items, among the higher-income groups.&#13;
This marks a relative shift from fish and vegetables to the other sources of&#13;
protein as income rises.&#13;
Among the major sources of micronutrients, namely legumes, vegetables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
fruits and "other" foods, we observe almost uniformly high income elasticities&#13;
of demand for fruits, especially among the middle classes, and for "other"&#13;
foods and legumes among the lower classes.&#13;
The total expenditure elasticities of demand for nutrients are not&#13;
easy to predict from the previous discussion, as these combine the effects of&#13;
total expenditures on all foods, as well as the relative contributions of&#13;
various foods to different nutrients. The findings are reported in Table 17.&#13;
What is commonly observed are the falling elasticities by income&#13;
groups. This signifies saturation in terms of nutrients, and underscores the&#13;
previous findings that households shift to more expensive foods as their&#13;
income rises, while maintaining their nutrient consumption. That is, while&#13;
changes in total expenditures bring about some dramatic changes in food&#13;
consumption, the changes in nutrient consumption are much less pronounced.&#13;
Among low-income groups, fat stands out with a high income elasticity&#13;
of demand. Likewise vitamin A and vitamin C in the Outer Islands. The&#13;
finding concerning fats may signify the substitution, which is apparent among&#13;
the poor, from fish to meat as income rises, as well as the dependence of the&#13;
poor on legumes. Vitamin A and vitamin C are known to be income-sensitive&#13;
micronutrients, since they are so closely related to the consumption of&#13;
particular fruits and vegetables.&#13;
The relatively lower elasticities, especially for the lower-income&#13;
group, in the Outer Islands, reflects the fact that the lower 40% expenditure&#13;
group there is better-off than the lower 40% expenditure group in Java. In&#13;
both Java and the Outer Islands, changes in incomes of the calorie-deficient&#13;
population are most likely to affect their consumption of fats, vitamins A and&#13;
C, and calcium.&#13;

4.3      Price Elasticities of Demand for Foods and Nutrients&#13;
We turn now to a discussion of own and cross (compensated) price&#13;
elasticities of demand for foods and nutrients in which we focus on the&#13;
population deficient in calories who are of the most concern to policy&#13;
makers. Table 18 gives price elasticities of demand for different foods for&#13;
the calorie-deficient groups for Java.and the Outer Islands separately.-1&#13;
All of the own price elasticities of demand, except for legumes and&#13;
corn in Java, are negative, as would be expected. In Java, the consumption of&#13;
potatoes, fish, meat and poultry, dairy products and fruits is especially&#13;
sensitive to changes in their own prices; this is the case for corn, wheat,&#13;
potatoes, meat and poultry, dairy products, eggs, legumes and fruits in the&#13;
Outer Islands. Relatively inelastic demand for corn, vegetables and "other"&#13;
food items with respect to their own prices is observed in Java, and for rice&#13;
and "other" food items in the Outer Islands.&#13;
The price elasticity of demand for rice is higher in Java than in the&#13;
Outer Islands; a 10% increase in the price of rice will bring about a 15%&#13;
decline in the quantities consumed by the calorie-deficient households in&#13;
Java, but only an 8% decline in the Outer Islands, where the population is&#13;
less dependent on rice.&#13;
In interpreting the effects of price changes on other commodities, we&#13;
focus on those cases where the cross price elasticities are not only statisti-&#13;
cally significant but also relatively large. First, among the staples we&#13;
clearly observe some substitution among them, although the cross price elasti-&#13;
cities are not always consistent in magnitude and sign. An increase in the&#13;
price of rice leads to greater consumption of corn in Java. An increase in&#13;
the price of corn has a particularly strong positive impact on consumption of&#13;
_1/ Only statistically significant coefficients are presented.&#13;

cassava and potatoes, especially in the Outer Islands. An increase in the&#13;
price of wheat leads to increasing consumption of cassava and potatoes, as&#13;
well as rice in the Outer Islands. Hence, there is a fair amount of substi-&#13;
tution among the staples.&#13;
Second, what is perhaps more interesting is the extent to which&#13;
changes in the prices of staples affect the consumption of nonstaple foods,&#13;
and vice versa, as well as the way in which the consumption of different&#13;
nonstaple foods is affected by the prices of other nonstaples. The food&#13;
groups the consumption of which is most sensitive to price changes in both the&#13;
prices of staples and of other nonstaples are fish, fruits and vegetables in&#13;
Java; and fruits in the Outer Islands. Unlike the case of fish, meat and&#13;
poultry consumption is not as sensitive to the prices of any of the other food&#13;
groups. The nature of the effects relates to specific food consumption&#13;
patterns which are hard to study with these data. It is not clear, for&#13;
example, why consumption of meat and poultry in Java is positively correlated&#13;
with the price of rice. One effect may be related to the correlation between&#13;
consumption of expensive varieties of rice by the rich and consumption of meat&#13;
and poultry.&#13;
In the Outer Islands, the situation is quite different in that the&#13;
cross price elasticities tend to be lower than in Java, so that the consump-&#13;
tion of a food group is less sensitive to changes in the prices of the other&#13;
foods. This may reflect the fact that the population in the Outer Islands is&#13;
better-off than that in Java and therefore food prices matter less in the&#13;
latter region.&#13;
The consumption of nutrients is affected by price changes through&#13;
their impact on food consumption, given the shares in the total food budget of&#13;
the food groups which are significantly affected. The price elasticities of&#13;
demand for nutrients are presented in Table 19. As would be expected, given&#13;

the importance of rice as a source of nutrients, a rise in its price adversely&#13;
affects the intakes of calories, protein, carbohydrates, thiamine and niacin,&#13;
especially in Java. However, through the substitution of other foods, there&#13;
is in fact a net increase in the consumption of vitamin A and calcium in Java,&#13;
and vitamin C in both regions.&#13;
The prices whose rises bring about negative effects on the consump-&#13;
tion of nutrients are the price of wheat, on the consumption of calcium in&#13;
Java; the price of cassava, on the consumption of calcium in the Outer&#13;
Islands; the price of vegetables, on the consumption of iron and riboflavin;&#13;
the price of cassava and potatoes, on the consumption of vitamin A in the&#13;
Outer Islands; and the prices of cassava and wheat, on the consumption of&#13;
vitamin C.&#13;

Next we turn to the effect of the household's demographic character-&#13;
istics on food consumption and nutrition. These effects are expected to be&#13;
similar to those from changes in income which constrain the household's&#13;
budget. 1/ The findings for the calorie-deficient population of Java and the&#13;
Outer Islands are presented in Tables 20 and 21.&#13;
The results exhibit some general and expected patterns. As the&#13;
number of household members increases, households reduce their consumption of&#13;
meat and poultry, eggs, and fruits, as well as legumes in the Outer Islands.&#13;
They do so in order to increase consumption of all other categories of food;&#13;
there is a notable relative increase in consumption of cassava.&#13;
2.    Unlike the previous estimates, these are not elasticities, but coeffi-&#13;
cients of a semi-logarithmic relationship; the marginal effect of an increase&#13;
in the independent variable rises with the rise in the dependent variable.&#13;

As expected, with the advent of children, households consume more&#13;
dairy products; these are given up when the household has a relatively larger&#13;
number of adults who consume more corn and cassava. These shifts in food&#13;
consumption due to variations in family size and composition do not bring&#13;
about fundamental changes in the consumption of nutrients, as shown in Table&#13;
21.&#13;
Cassava has a relatively important role in protecting the consumption&#13;
of nutrients of larger families, although not enough to avoid a decline in&#13;
terms of nutrients per capita. Nutrients which are particularly vulnerable&#13;
are protein and fat, iron for children, and vitamins A and C for adults. On&#13;
the whole, the Outer Islands are more vulnerable to inadequate nutrient con-&#13;
sumption as a result of increasing family size.&#13;
4.5      Efficiency in Food and Nutrition Consumption&#13;
Some of the major practical and conceptual issues related to food&#13;
consumption concern food quality and efficiency of nutrient consumption. As&#13;
is evident in the data, wealthier households buy more expensive food&#13;
varieties. In fact, the estimated price elasticities incorporate a degree of&#13;
quantity-quality substitution, whereby households consuming more expensive&#13;
foods buy smaller quantities than households consuming relatively inexpensive&#13;
foods.&#13;
There are many explanations to this behavior in terms of taste, such&#13;
as variety or packaging, and possible time saving in preparation. As pointed&#13;
out earlier, however, a more expensive diet does not necessarily imply a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

better diet in terms of nutrition. I/   Hence, from a narrow perspective of the&#13;
relation between food consumption and nutrition, one can pose the question of&#13;
how efficiently households attain their nutritional requirements. In other&#13;
words, for given incomes and market prices, are some households better than&#13;
others in attaining certain levels of nutrient intakes?&#13;
We first address this question by looking at the prices that people&#13;
pay for a given amount of a particular nutrient embodied in an average basket&#13;
of foods comprising their diet. This is a function of food prices and the&#13;
shares of foods in the provision of particular nutrients.&#13;
These average prices are presented in Table 22. The results show&#13;
relatively expensive diets in Jakarta and relatively inexpensive diets in East&#13;
Java. Diets are more expensive in urban areas compared with rural areas, and&#13;
in November compared with the other months observed.&#13;
While the rich pay more for their diets than the poor, there is no&#13;
evidence that the calorie-deficient population pays more than the nondeficient&#13;
population. On the whole, protein and vitamins are derived from more&#13;
expensive sources for the nondeficent population, compared with the calorie-&#13;
deficient group.&#13;
This conclusion is supported by a set of unreported regressions in&#13;
which the prices of nutrients have been used as dependent variables to be&#13;
explained by household monthly expenditure, family size and composition,&#13;
education of the spouse of the household head, and source of income 2/    Higher&#13;
levels of expenditures and smaller numbers of household members, particularly&#13;
21   Given the estimated level of calorie deficiency in Indonesia, we do not&#13;
deal with the qualitative aspects of expensive diets, traces of which can be&#13;
seen in the data which show higher consumption of fats and "other" foods,&#13;
including soft drinks, with rising incomes.&#13;
2/  These regressions can be obtained upon request.&#13;

of adults, are associated with higher prices for nutrients. The prices of&#13;
iron and vitamin A appear to be particularly sensitive to variations in income&#13;
and family size.&#13;
Education has a somewhat similar effect to the level of expendi-&#13;
tures. That is, higher levels of education are in general associated with&#13;
more expensive diets in Java, and to a lesser degree in the Outer Islands.&#13;
As far as sources of income are concerned, households reporting&#13;
incomes from agriculture also report the least-cost diets, all other things&#13;
equal. This presumably reflects the fact that people engaged in agriculture&#13;
have easier access to food.&#13;
These results suggest that the poor can to a degree "protect" their&#13;
nutritional intake by obtaining their food from relatively inexpensive&#13;
sources. But to the extent that the findings of previous sections indicate&#13;
clearly that lower food prices in themselves do not give enough "protection'&#13;
for the poor, it is important to study the effect of education and sources of&#13;
income on the diet while incomes, prices, and family size and composition are&#13;
controlled for.&#13;
The results reported in Tables 23 and 24 show that in both Java and&#13;
the Outer Islands higher education is associated with a reduction in the con-&#13;
sumption of calories, protein, carbohydrates, iron, thiamine and niacin.&#13;
Interestingly enough, there does not seem to be a compensating gain in any&#13;
other particular nutrient. This finding, combined with that concerning&#13;
prices, strongly suggests that the more educated homemakers buy more expensive&#13;
foods, but at a net loss in terms of nutrition. The exception is the higher&#13;
consumption levels of fats among families of homemakers with elementary&#13;
schooling.&#13;

In conclusion, households engaged in agricultural and industrial&#13;
activities have better diets in terms of nutrition. The relatively educated&#13;
homemakers have more expensive diets at some sacrifice of a broad range of&#13;
nutrients. This last point strongly suggests that there is scope for&#13;
nutrition education in Indonesia, especially in Java where nutritional&#13;
inadequacy is less related to income than in the Outer Islands.&#13;
V.       SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper has two objectives. The first is to show how food and&#13;
nutrition consumption in Indonesia vary by region, location of residence,&#13;
season, and socioeconomic class. The second is to identify and estimate the&#13;
basic parameters which explain why households consume what they do in terms of&#13;
foods and nutrients, given their characteristics and market conditions.&#13;
Particular attention has been given to the estimation of income and price&#13;
elasticities of demand; these are good indicators of how households will&#13;
respond to changes in incomes and prices, given their demographic and other&#13;
characteristics. Understanding these responses is critical for the design of&#13;
policies related to nutrition.&#13;
The study is based on the 1978 National Socio-Economic Survey&#13;
(SUSENAS) which was conducted in four rounds and covered some 6,300 households&#13;
in each round. Among others, information concerning the quantities of, and&#13;
expenditures on, roughly 120 food items was collected.&#13;
We observe in the data great variations in food consumption&#13;
patterns. The share of rice in household budgets ranges from 17% in Maluku&#13;
and Irian Jaya to 44% in West Java. Cassava constitutes a relatively minor&#13;
item in the household budget. The vast majority of the population report&#13;
consumption of rice, vegetables and "other" foods. Fish, fruits, and legumes&#13;
are relatively important as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Urban dwellers and the rich tend to have more varied diets. In this&#13;
context it is important to point out that, while the budget share on staples&#13;
declines with rising incomes, the share spent on rice increases, while that on&#13;
corn, for example, decreases. Spatial and seasonal variations in food&#13;
consumption patterns are highly consistent with observed variations in income&#13;
levels and prices.&#13;
Consumption of different nutrients exhibits similar patterns to food&#13;
consumption. Consumption of nutrients is generally higher in the relatively&#13;
more affluent Outer Islands than in Java. Generally high consumption levels&#13;
are reported in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and low levels in Central Java and&#13;
Yogyakarta. Calories, carbohydrates and vitamin C are consumed in larger&#13;
quantities in rural areas than in urban areas. Protein and vitamin A&#13;
consumption is higher in urban Java than in rural Java. The opposite holds&#13;
for the Outer Islands.&#13;
Although data on reported consumption should be interpreted with&#13;
caution, the data strongly suggest widespread deficiencies in all nutrients.&#13;
The problem is more serious in Java than in the Outer Islands, at least as far&#13;
as calories are concerned. Furthermore, it appears that the problem is more&#13;
one of maldistribution than of an overall shortfall in the availability of&#13;
foods.&#13;
The major distinguishing characteristic between households which meet&#13;
minimal nutritional requirements and those which do not is the level of&#13;
household expenditure, especially in the Outer Islands. Households not&#13;
deficient in calories tend to be smaller and have more educated homemakers.&#13;
In examining the sources of the various nutrients, the significance&#13;
of rice as a contributor of most nutrients is striking. No other food group&#13;
is so important from a nutritional standpoint in the Indonesian diet.&#13;
Variations in household incomes/expenditures are associated with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
marked variations in food consumption patterns. Except for the consumption of&#13;
corn and cassava, households increase their consumption of all foods as they&#13;
become wealthier. This is particularly true for wheat, potatoes, meat and&#13;
poultry, milk, legumes and fruits. The same is true for nutrients, although&#13;
the changes are much less dramatic than for foods.&#13;
These particular findings, combined with the effects on consumption&#13;
patterns of household composition, indicate that the substitutions taking&#13;
place in food consumption with changes in income and family size and com-&#13;
position are fairly efficient in "protecting" the nutritional intake of&#13;
households.&#13;
The results concerning the effects of prices on food consumption&#13;
patterns are relatively tentative, as these prices reflect in part qualitative&#13;
differences in food consumption which require further study. Nonetheless, it&#13;
is already apparent that there is a great deal of substitution going on as&#13;
prices change. Among staples, consumption of rice among low-income groups in&#13;
particular is relatively sensitive to changes in its own price; people tend to&#13;
substitute rice with corn and cassava, and to a relatively lesser degree with&#13;
wheat. Among the relatively poor, consumption of potatoes, fish, meat and&#13;
fruits is relatively sensitive to changes in the prices of these commodities.&#13;
The substitution taking place when prices change is also manifested&#13;
in the effect of price variation on the consumption of nutrients. We again&#13;
see changes which are relatively smaller than those taking place in food&#13;
consumption as prices vary. Consumption of calories, protein, and carbohy-&#13;
drates is adversely affected by an increase in the price of rice to such an&#13;
extent that it can hardly be compensated for by lowering the price of any&#13;
particular food group.&#13;
Relatively wealthy households with educated homemakers buy relatively&#13;
expensive diets with some sacrifice in terms of nutrients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Households which report incomes from agriculture are better-off, in&#13;
terms of nutritional intake, than households with incomes from other&#13;
sources. This suggests that agricultural households, which are relatively&#13;
poor, also have easier access to their food.&#13;
To conclude, the results suggest that there is wide scope for nutri-&#13;
tion policies based on changes in incomes and relative prices, as food and&#13;
nutrient consumption respond rather dramatically to such changes. These may&#13;
come about both in terms of the numbers of households consuming different food&#13;
items and the quantities consumed of various foods. It is not clear at this&#13;
stage how people respond to income and price changes in terms of buying more&#13;
or less expensive food varieties, and what effect this has on nutrition.&#13;
As incomes rise, the dependency on rice increases as well. This&#13;
dependency can be reduced by appropriate pricing policies. However, any such&#13;
policies must take into account the evidence suggesting that no single food&#13;
can substitute for rice as a major source of most nutrients. For example,&#13;
inducing more cassava consumption at the expense of rice may increase calorie&#13;
consumption but could at the same time be detrimental in terms of the intakes&#13;
of other nutrients.&#13;
It is clear that the problem of nutritional adequacy in Indonesia is&#13;
closely associated with levels of income and rice consumption. However, the&#13;
data strongly suggest that inadequate diets are prevalent among the better-off&#13;
and the better-educated as well; some of them consume more expensive diets at&#13;
a loss in terms of nutrition. Hence, alleviating malnutrition in Indonesia is&#13;
not just a matter of raising levels of income but also of nutrition education.&#13;

Annex 1:   GROUPING OF FOODS&#13;
The grouping of foods is as follows:&#13;
(1) Rice includes free-market, self-produced, and glutinous rice, as&#13;
well as rice byproducts (such as rice flour).&#13;
(2) Corn includes both fresh and dried corn on the husk, shelled&#13;
corn, and corn meal.&#13;
(3) Wheat includes wheat flour and other grains.&#13;
(4) cassava refers to fresh and dried cassava, and cassava meal.&#13;
(4) Potatoes cover sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro and sago. (The&#13;
latter two are starchy plants similar to potatoes.)&#13;
(6) Fish includes fresh ocean and inland fish, salted and dried&#13;
fish, canned fish, shrimp, and shellfish.&#13;
(7) Meat and poultry covers beef from cattle and carabao (water&#13;
buffalo), mutton, pork, preserved meat, veal, chicken, and turkey.&#13;
(8) Eggs are treated separately because of the difficulty of&#13;
combining this item with any other.&#13;
(9)  Dairy products cover fresh milk, evaporated milk, powdered milk,&#13;
and cheese.&#13;
(10)  Vegetables include spinach, kangkung spinach, cabbage, mustard&#13;
greens, beans, peas, strong beans, tomatoes, radishes, carrots, cucumbers,&#13;
cassava leaves, eggplant, bean sprouts, squash, red and white onions, red and&#13;
cayenne peppers, and papaya leaves.&#13;
(11) Legumes refer to peanuts, green and red beans, soybeans,&#13;
tunggak. beans, bean curd, soybean cake, tauco, peanut cake, and lamtoro.&#13;
(12)  Fruits include citrus fruits, mangoes, apples, avocados,&#13;
rambutan, dukuh, durian, salak, pineapple, bananas, papaya, jambu, guava,&#13;
sawo, belimbing, kedongdong, and water melon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
(13) "Other" includes salt, pepper and other spices, fish paste,&#13;
ketchup, coconut, cooking oil, butter, lard, brown and granulated sugar, tea,&#13;
coffee, cocoa, fried fish sticks, noodles, monosodium glutamate, lemon syrup,&#13;
bottled drinks (lemonade, cola, orange soda, etc.), bread, beer, and alcohol.&#13;
For computational purposes, those foods given in units other than&#13;
kilograms were converted to kilograms. All items in food groups 1-6 and 10-12&#13;
were given initially in kilograms; conversion for foods in the remaining&#13;
groups are given below.&#13;
Group 7 contains chicken and turkey, each given in units of one&#13;
bird. A chicken was assumed to weigh one kilogram; a turkey was assigned a&#13;
weight of 4.5 kilograms.&#13;
Group 8 comprises only eggs; therefore, no conversion was&#13;
necessary.&#13;
In group 9, the item "fresh milk" was given in liters. One liter of&#13;
fresh milk has a weight of 1.032 kilograms.&#13;
Because of the diverse nature of group 13, the foods it contains are&#13;
presented in several different units. Fried fish sticks, noodles, and bread&#13;
were the only items given in kilograms. A number of items were given in units&#13;
of 100 grams which have been converted into kilograms. These items are salt,&#13;
pepper and other spices, fish paste, butter, lard, brown sugar, granulated&#13;
sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa, and monosodium glutamate. A bottle of ketchup was&#13;
assigned a weight of 500 grams; likewise, a coconut was assumed to weigh 500&#13;
grams. Cooking oil, lemon syrup, and bottled drinks were each given in&#13;
liters; the first has a weight of 0.93 kilograms per liter, while the latter&#13;
two each weighs 1.04 kilograms per liter. A 12-ounce bottle of beer has a&#13;
weight of 0.36 kilograms; a "shot' of alcohol containing one and a half&#13;
ounces weighs 0.042 kilograms.&#13;

            Patterns of food consumption and nutrition
            in Indonesia : an analysis of the national socioeconomic
            survey, 1978
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this paper is to estimate
            the level of consumption of food and of nutrients for the
            Indonesian population; to identify population groups with
            nutrient deficiencies, to identify the major sources of
            different nutrients, and to estimate income and price
            elasticites of demand for both food and nutrients. The
            survey data indicates that serious deficiencies in all
            nutrients exist in Indonesia and that the problem is more
            one of maldistribution than of an overall shortfall in the
            availability of foods, tending to affect the poorer
            households. The importance of rice as a contributor of most
            nutrients is striking. A household utility-maximization
            model is used to derive the household's demand for food
            and hence nutrients. For estimation purposes the
            double-logarithmic function is used. The paper concludes
            that there is wide scope for nutrition policies based on
            changes in incomes and relative prices, as food and
            nutrition consumption respond rather dramatically to such
            changes. The data also suggest that, although inadequate
            diets are a greater problem among poorer households, they
            are also prevalent among the better-off and better-educated.
            Alleviating malnutrition in Indonesia is a matter of
            nutrition education as well as one of raising incomes.
