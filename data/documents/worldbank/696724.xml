PREFACE&#13;
This Project Implementation Plan was prepared during pre-appraisal and appraisal&#13;
missions in May and June/July 1995 and discussed with the Ministry of Finance&#13;
during these missions and subsequent, post appraisal briefings. The World Bank&#13;
project team was led by Mr. Hiran Herat and included Messrs. Craig Neal,&#13;
Stanislas Balcera, Hemant Shah and Ms. Yvonne Jones. This document reflects&#13;
the helpful comments and generous assistance by many Croatian and other&#13;
country counterpart. Most notably, it reflects the close collaboration and support&#13;
of the Assistant Minister of Finance of the Republic of Croatia, Mrs. Ljerka&#13;
Ercegovic as well as the active participation and encouragement of the Minister&#13;
of Finance, Mr. Bozo Prka.&#13;
By consolidating the design and planning work for the project, as well as the&#13;
terms of references for the technical assistance contracts, this plan will serve as&#13;
a reference for all key project activities by current and future project participants.&#13;
This, the authors hope, will provide greater coherence and continuity of actions&#13;
over the project period. Although the plan cannot provide exhaustive detail on all&#13;
project activities, it is sufficiently detailed to remain a working document for the&#13;
duration of the project. Thus, the project implementation team is strongly&#13;
encouraged to update and revise the plan to reflect work accomplished and&#13;
further refinements in the project design and schedule.&#13;

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  --1 --       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
Capital Markets Development Project&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP)&#13;
-THE PROJECT --&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
1.    The overall aim of the Capital Markets Development Project is to support the&#13;
Govemment of the Republic of Croatia's economic transformation programs, by&#13;
facilitating the privatization and restructuring processes and, more generally,&#13;
developing the capital markets institutions required for a modem market-based&#13;
economy. In particular, the Govemment wants to strengthen:&#13;
a.    the policy framework for the capital markets, especially the regulation&#13;
of securities markets;&#13;
b.    the operational capabilities of key capital markets entities, especially&#13;
the securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement functions;&#13;
c.    the public's comprehension of the capital markets and their roles as&#13;
shareholders.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.    The Capital Markets Development Project will provide technical assistance,&#13;
training, information technologies and various office-related equipment and resources.&#13;
The total cost of the Project is US$21.0 million equivalent, including physical and&#13;
price contingencies, taxes and duties, and recurrent expenses for the three and one&#13;
half years of the project. The World Bank will finance US$9.5 million equivalent of&#13;
investment expenditures. The Project will be implemented over a period of four years&#13;
under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in collaboration&#13;
with the securities "depository" (VVS), the Institute for Payment Transactions (ZZPP),&#13;
Ministry of Privatization (MOP) and the Republic Fund for Pension and Disability&#13;
Insurance of Workers in Croatia (the "Pension Fund", for brevity).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 2 --   Project Implementation Plan&#13;
3.    The Project focuses on a few key initiatives in three basic project components.&#13;
a.    Policy Support&#13;
i.    regulatory and organizational development of the Croatian&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC);&#13;
ii.   technical assistance on the conversion of illiquid govemment&#13;
debt instruments into tradeable securities;&#13;
iii.   technical assistance on portfolio management to the asset&#13;
holding arm of the Pension Fund.&#13;
b.    Infrastructure Development:&#13;
i.    design, development and implementation of securities&#13;
depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities (WS),&#13;
including a program to immobilize existing physical certificates&#13;
and secure existing share registries;&#13;
c.    Public Awareness:&#13;
i.    mass media development (television, radio and print media);&#13;
ii.    mass media campaign ("air' time, printing and distribution).&#13;
-- IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS --&#13;
Organizations Responsible for the Project&#13;
4.    The Ministry of Finance will administer the funds under the Project and&#13;
coordinate project activities through a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU will&#13;
be headed by a full time Project Implementation Officer with extensive project&#13;
management experience. In addition, the MOF will organize a Project Steering&#13;
Committee with representatives from the major participants in the Croatian capital&#13;
market. The Committee will advise the MOF on matters of substance and priority&#13;
which the PIU and the project teams will bring to it (in coordination with the PIU).&#13;
5.    The MOF will establish three teams to implement the various project&#13;
components. (Figure 1 on page 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.)&#13;
a.    Policy Support. A MOF team, headed by the Assistant Finance&#13;
Minister, will coordinate the policy support activities, with participation&#13;
by staff from the Ministry of Justice, the National Bank of Croatia,&#13;
Ministry of Privatization, the Pension Fund, the banking, brokerage and&#13;
enterprise sectors, as well as foreign consultants. This team will focus&#13;
on the legislative and regulatory policy issues in the capital markets&#13;
and the establishment of CROSEC. A smaller technical assistance&#13;
effort will be directed at converting certain illiquid government debt&#13;
instruments into tradeable securities and at strengthening the portfolio&#13;
management capacity of the Pension Fund.&#13;
b.    Infrastructure Development. A second team will include personnel&#13;
from VVS and ZZPP, and will have the assistance of foreign&#13;
consultants. The team will coordinate closely with representatives&#13;
from key private sector entities, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange,&#13;
the Broker's Association, commercial banks, the Varazdin OTC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 3 --   Project Implementation Plan&#13;
market, and corporations, as well as with key public sector entities,&#13;
such as the Pension Fund. This team will focus on the development of&#13;
the securities depository, clearing and settlement facilities as well as&#13;
strengthening the linkages between the depository and selected capital&#13;
market entities, such as the exchanges, brokers, etc.&#13;
c.    Public Awareness. The Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of&#13;
Privatization, headed by its assistant minister and supported by a team&#13;
of public relations professionals, will manage the public awareness&#13;
component. This effort will draw on a variety of agencies in the capital&#13;
markets to define the substantive message, and on local mass media&#13;
organizations and professionals to refine the strategy and select the&#13;
most effective media vehicles.&#13;
Agreements Between the Borrower and Implementation Agencies&#13;
6.    The Borrower is the Republic of Croatia, represented by its Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
7.    The Loan finances, among other things, the development of securities&#13;
depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities (the "depository", for brevity).&#13;
These facilities currently exist as a registered legal entity with both public and private&#13;
equity capital: WS. However, they must be developed and made operational.&#13;
8.    To avoid the delays and risks of building the administrative apparatus from&#13;
scratch, as an interim measure, the Government has decided to utilize the&#13;
administrative and technical resources of the Institute for Payment Transactions&#13;
(ZZPP) to make the depository operational. However, to preserve and extend the&#13;
capital markets' oversight of the critical depository function, WS will retain its legal&#13;
and financial identity. During the initial development phase, a formal contract&#13;
between WS and ZZPP will govern ZZPP's responsibilities, resource contributions&#13;
and how those contributions will be reflected in WS's capitalization and governance.&#13;
Details of these arrangements will be based on a strategic analysis of the securities&#13;
depository, registry, clearing and settlement functions in the Croatian context. (See&#13;
Annex D on page 45 for a description of this analysis.)&#13;
9.    To ensure long term, private sector oversight of WS, the MOF will seek&#13;
majority private sector shareholding of WS at the earliest possible date. The timing&#13;
of the privatization will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the scope of&#13;
WS's responsibilities (as determined through the strategic analysis); (ii) the speed&#13;
and cost of the development and implementation work; (iii) the strength of private&#13;
sector entities in the capital markets; and (iv) the evolution of the demand for WS&#13;
services. Given the transitional environment of the Croatian economy, these factors&#13;
have a high degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, an operational depository with an&#13;
initial business record will emerge by the end of the project period and provide a&#13;
concrete basis for the Government to formulate its privatization plans.&#13;

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 5 --    Project Implementation Plan&#13;
10.   Notwithstanding the Government's objective to privatize VVS, it will have&#13;
to assess what, if any, public service functions VVS will undertake and how&#13;
these will be reflected in VVS funding and governance. Specifically, during the&#13;
initial phases of corporate privatizations as well as the subsequent rationalization&#13;
of enterprise ownership, VVS will perform a major public service by lowering the&#13;
risk of misadministration of the depository functions, by, among other things,&#13;
economizing on scarce supervisory resources. Given the public's limited&#13;
understanding of capital markets and their not altogether benign experiences with&#13;
the formal financial sector (e.g., the so-called "Frozen Deposits"), lowering these&#13;
risks is critical for the viability of the capital markets and, consequently, for the&#13;
privatization program and the overall economic transformation. Once this&#13;
transition period has given way to more stable and conventional securities trading&#13;
patterns, however, VVS will face a significantly different demand for its services.&#13;
11.   Given the unavoidable uncertainty over the evolution of the demand for&#13;
trading and shareholder services, as well as the costs of operating VVS in the&#13;
post-transition period (i.e. after project completion), the Government will have to&#13;
determine what, if any, continued public financial support it will provide to VVS&#13;
and how this will be reflected in VVS's governance arrangements. The strategic&#13;
analysis for the depository functions includes the formulation of a business and&#13;
financing model to assist the authorities in these decisions. The project also&#13;
provides support for a privatization plan for VVS (most likely to be undertaken&#13;
during the last year of the project).&#13;
1 2.   The privatization plan must address, among other things, the fact that the&#13;
depository's functional requirements and most appropriate institutional&#13;
arrangements will change over time. For example, although the preliminary&#13;
design anticipates a centralized depository, with securities accounts tracked to&#13;
the final customer level (i.e., a one tier, "single vault" architecture), this design&#13;
reflects the current weakness of alternative institutions in Croatia and the fragility&#13;
of the public's confidence in the formal financial system. In a few years time, an&#13;
increase in the capacity of banks and brokers to offer high fidelity depository,&#13;
registry, clearing and settlement services and the public's greater familiarity with&#13;
capital markets will open the possibility to move to a more distributed, multi-tier,&#13;
multi-vault depository architecture. At this stage, and as part of the privatization&#13;
process, VVS could be required to achieve financial self-sufficiency (if it had not&#13;
already). In turn, full cost recovery may lead to the then infrequently and closely&#13;
traded securities devolving to banks and brokers for depository services. VVS&#13;
may then refocus on the accounts of the direct market participants (brokers,&#13;
dealers, banks and institutional investors) and on a smaller number of key publicly&#13;
traded securities. The strategic decisions, such as whether or not to distribute&#13;
the depository functions, will require careful monitoring of evolution of the&#13;
market, by CROSEC, the MOF, the National Bank of Croatia and other key capital&#13;
markets policy makers. Also, such changes are likely to require revisions to the&#13;
legal and financial arrangements of VVS. The privatization plan will need to&#13;
address these issues as well as the appropriate regulatory structures to ensure&#13;
that the public interest is properly served.&#13;

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 9 --   Proiect Implementation Plan&#13;
-- PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS --&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
17.   The proposed Bank loan of US$9.5 million equivalent will finance 46.4&#13;
percent of the total project costs, which comprise 51.3 percent in foreign&#13;
exchange costs (US$10.5 million equivalent) and 43.3 percent in local costs,&#13;
excluding taxes (US$8.9 million equivalent). USAID will provide about&#13;
US$1.1 million equivalent in foreign technical assistance. The MOF will finance&#13;
the balance of project costs (about US$9.9 million equivalent), including duties&#13;
and taxes which are estimated at US$1.1 million equivalent. Recurrent&#13;
incremental costs, which comprise equipment operations and maintenance,&#13;
facilities service costs and incremental staff costs (US$5.9 million equivalent),&#13;
will be financed entirely by the Government. The financing plan is shown in&#13;
Tables 2 and 3 on the next page.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
18.   Table 4 on page 11 shows total project costs, by project component and by&#13;
expenditure category. Total costs are investment plus recurrent costs for the project&#13;
period. These are estimated as base costs, plus physical and price contingencies,&#13;
plus taxes and duties. Specifically:&#13;
a.    Base Costs. Base costs were estimated in June 1995, using the&#13;
experience of other World Bank projects in the region, similar activities&#13;
in neighboring countries and detailed input from various Croatian&#13;
counterparts. ( See Annex M page 89 for the detailed estimates).&#13;
b.    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for&#13;
unforeseen physical variations (US$1.7 million) equivalent to&#13;
10 percent of the base cost of all project items. The following rates&#13;
were used to cover expected price escalation: local costs 2.6 percent&#13;
for CY95-98; foreign costs 2.6 percent for CY95-98.&#13;
c.    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is&#13;
estimated at about US$10.5 million including contingencies, or&#13;
51.3 percent of total project cost. Calculations of the foreign exchange&#13;
component were derived from an item-by-item analysis.&#13;
d.    Customs, Duties and Taxes. Goods and external services to be&#13;
purchased under the Project will be exempt from taxes and duties.&#13;
Taxes and duties for civil works and local technical assistance are&#13;
estimated at 10 percent. Therefore, project costs include an estimated&#13;
US$1.1 million equivalent in direct and indirect taxes and duties on&#13;
goods and services, to be financed by the Government.&#13;
19.   About US$5.9 million equivalent is required to cover incremental operating&#13;
costs directly attributable to the Project during the April 1996 to December 1998&#13;
period. These consist of incremental operation and maintenance expenditure for&#13;
equipment, facilities related charges and incremental staff.&#13;

Other includes: Bank-financed consulting services and training to be procured in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines for Use of Consultants, with an aggregate amount of US$5.6 million; International Shopping for small&#13;
amount of goods for which the cost of ICB outweighs the any possible price advantages will be used with&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million; and prudent&#13;
National Shopping will be used for sundry items not exceeding US$25,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$75,000.&#13;
Direct Contracting for proprietary, time critical or special compatible equipment may be used subject to Bank prior&#13;
review and up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000.&#13;
21.    Procurement of Goods.  Equipment contracts which are estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" January 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 13 --  Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Equipment (2 major packages) have been be packaged according to related&#13;
specialized fields. Equipment procured through ICB (US$2.7 million equivalent)&#13;
will account for about 90.5 percent of the total Bank-financed equipment value&#13;
(US$3.0 million equivalent). The remaining 9.5 percent of the Bank-financed&#13;
equipment value will be in packages suitable for procurement other than ICB. In&#13;
the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, local&#13;
manufacturers, which have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and&#13;
the Bank that: (i) labor, raw materials and components form within the country&#13;
of the Borrower will account for more than 30 percent of the EXW price of the&#13;
product offered, and (ii) the production facility in which the goods will be&#13;
manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing/assembling such&#13;
goods at lease since the time of bid submission, would receive a preference in an&#13;
amount equal to: (i) the amount of duties and other related import charges which&#13;
a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods&#13;
offered; or (ii) 1 5 percent of the CIF or CIP bid price of such goods if said duties&#13;
and charges exceed 1 5 percent of such price. Appropriate Bank standard&#13;
bidding documents will be used for procurement of goods and equipment. (The&#13;
General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project appeared in the September 19,&#13;
1995 edition of Development Business Forum.)&#13;
22.   Methods other than ICB are:&#13;
a.   International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for small&#13;
amounts of equipment where the cost of ICB would clearly&#13;
outweigh possible price advantages. Contracts for equipment&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract, not to&#13;
exceed an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million equivalent, will be&#13;
awarded under international shopping procedures, based on&#13;
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers&#13;
from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
b.    National Shopping (NS). Minor sundry items, such as small lots of&#13;
information technologies and office equipment, not exceeding&#13;
US$25,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$75,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of prudent&#13;
national shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from at&#13;
least three local suppliers, in accordance with Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
c.    Direct Contracting (DCJ. Goods and technical licenses which the&#13;
Bank agrees: (i) are of proprietary nature; lii) the timely supply&#13;
thereof is critical for efficient project execution; or (iii) need to be&#13;
compatible with other installed equipment, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$100,000 equivalent, may be procured through direct&#13;
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Such items include contracts&#13;
for intellectual property such as books, technical journals, training&#13;
materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software,&#13;
including annual upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights,&#13;

review is required for all direct contracting.&#13;
d.      Civil Works (CW). Civil works to upgrade facilities to&#13;
accommodate the offices and information systems coming under&#13;
the project represent an estimated value of US$0.7 million&#13;
equivalent. These will be financed entirely by the Government.&#13;

for technical assistance described in the TORs in Annexes A, and E, F, G, H and 1&#13;
in accordance with the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency", August 1981. (TA&#13;
described in Annexes B, C and D will be funded by USAID and procured&#13;
according to USAID procedures.) To keep the evaluation process manageable, no&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   -- 15 --         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited from a short list&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. It is anticipated that Bank-financed technical assistance&#13;
will be procured in five packages at a total cost of US$4.9 million equivalent. As&#13;
needed, the services of individual specialists (mainly for ad hoc advisory services&#13;
to the project teams) will also be contracted on the basis of short lists of eligible&#13;
candidates. It is anticipated that about US$0.6 million equivalent of the&#13;
aggregate for technical assistance would be for individual specialists. Travel and&#13;
subsistence relating to: (i) study tours to support the project teams and (ii) staff&#13;
and management development under the institutional development programs are&#13;
an estimated US$0.7 million equivalent.&#13;

27.    Bank Review. For goods and works, the Bank shall review the Borrower's&#13;
procurement decisions and procedures in accordance with Appendix 1 of the&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). In&#13;
particular: (i) each contract estimated to cost US$200,000 or more; (ii) the first&#13;
contract under each project component estimated to cost US$100,000 or more;&#13;
and (iii) all direct contracts; shall be subject to prior review, in accordance with&#13;
paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. Other goods and works contracts&#13;
costing US$50,000 or more shall be subject to post review in accordance with&#13;
paragraph 4 of the Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. For technical assistance&#13;
contracts, the applicable review procedures are discussed in various sections of&#13;
the Guidelines Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 16 --           Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). However, in the case of firms, for&#13;
technical assistance contracts, under US$100,000 equivalent, the Bank will&#13;
require prior review of only the terms of reference and short-lists of potential&#13;
consultants. In the case of individual consultants, the Bank will require prior&#13;
review only of TORs and short lists for contracts under US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
More generally, the Bank's Country Procurement Assistance Review (CPAR) will&#13;
be completed early next year after the Procurement Law has been passed by&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
Disbursement and Financing Schedules&#13;
28.   Disbursements. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a&#13;
period of three and one half years, which is shorter than the relevant profile in&#13;
the Region (about seven years). The shorter implementation period is possible&#13;
due to relatively tight focus of the Project, the strong commitment of the MOF&#13;
and generally high level of technical and organizational competency in the&#13;
relevant agencies. The closing date will be June 30, 1999. A summary of the&#13;
disbursement plan is shown in Table 8.&#13;

29.   To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a&#13;
Special Account in Deutsche marks in a commercial bank acceptable to the World&#13;
Bank. During the early phases of the project, the initial allocation of the Special&#13;
Account will be limited to 300,000 DEM. However, when the aggregate&#13;
disbursements under the Loan reach the level of 3.0 million DEM, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of 600,000 DEM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 17 --  Project Implementation Plan&#13;
30.   All disbursements against contracts for goods and services exceeding&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent will be fully documented. For expenditures below that level,&#13;
disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for goods&#13;
and services up to US$200,000 equivalent for which detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures will be reviewed and kept by the MOF and made available for the&#13;
required audit as well as to Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Audit Timetable&#13;
31.   Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited&#13;
in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank&#13;
(within six months of the end of each fiscal year), an audit report of such scope&#13;
and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified&#13;
statements of expenses (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether&#13;
the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and&#13;
internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the&#13;
related withdrawal applications.&#13;
32.   Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PIU will prepare semi-annual&#13;
descriptive and financial reports on each project component, objective and&#13;
activity (beginning from the date of Loan Effectiveness). The reports will&#13;
describe: (i) current status; (ii) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan;&#13;
and (iii) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. Reporting&#13;
and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of: (i) the emerging policy&#13;
framework; {ii) the effectiveness of component and sub-component activities and&#13;
their consistency with agreements reached at negotiations; (iii) performance of&#13;
the implementing groups and institutions; (iv) emerging needs for adjustments to&#13;
project parameters; and (v) possible follow-up operations which could be&#13;
supported by the Bank. Bank supervision will be based on the semi-annual&#13;
progress reports and the annual evaluation of project activities by the MOF. This&#13;
will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of&#13;
financial resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical&#13;
assistance groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various&#13;
components, and discussions with responsible authorities. A mid-term review of&#13;
the project will be carried out in September 1997. This PIP will provide the basis&#13;
for supervision and reporting.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES AND SCHEDULES&#13;
Project Activities&#13;
33.   Activities under each component are summarized below.&#13;
a.    Policy Support Component. The Policy Support Component entails&#13;
activities under three sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 18 --   Project Implementation Plan&#13;
i.    CROSEC Development. Since CROSEC and securities&#13;
regulations do not already exist, activities in this sub-&#13;
component include: (i) the hiring of commissioners and&#13;
staff; (ii) legal and regulatory development;&#13;
(iii) organizational development; (iv) procedural and&#13;
administrative development; (v) staff development; and&#13;
(vi) facilities. The Government has already begun looking&#13;
for a chief commissioner. The project will provide for a&#13;
major TA contact to undertake for the development&#13;
activities. The project will also fund equipment to establish&#13;
CROSEC's facilities. (See Annex A on page 27 for the TOR&#13;
describing the development TA.)&#13;
ii.    Tradeable Government Securities. USAID is funding a small&#13;
quick-response technical assistance effort to help the&#13;
Government and its local consultants convert certain illiquid&#13;
government debt obligations into tradeable securities&#13;
(specifically, convert the so-called "Big Bonds"). USAID's&#13;
consultants have already visited Zagreb (in late 1995) and&#13;
are continuing their technical assistance. (See Annex B on&#13;
page 35 for the TOR describing this TA.)&#13;
iii.   Pension Fund Portfolio Management. USAID will also fund a&#13;
major TA effort to help the portfolio management arm of the&#13;
Pension Fund. This effort will involve assessment and&#13;
planning of the most appropriate management strategy and&#13;
administrative arrangements. This will be followed by an&#13;
implementation phase focussed on organization, staff and&#13;
procedural development. (See Annex C on page 39 for the&#13;
TOR describing this TA.)&#13;
b.    Infrastructure Development Component. Since it establishes the&#13;
common "back office" functions of securities depository, registry,&#13;
clearing and settlement under the peculiar circumstances of the&#13;
overly-corporatized and widely-disbursed Croatian privatization&#13;
program, the Infrastructure Development Component is the largest&#13;
and most complex component in the project. Activities under this&#13;
component include:&#13;
i.    A USAID funded strategic analysis TA effort to: (i) define a&#13;
basic vision for these functions; (ii) assess the gaps in the&#13;
current structures; (iii) provide a set of recommendation;&#13;
(iv) outline a business model for the relevant facilities;&#13;
(v) specify a detailed action plan; and (vi) specify the&#13;
functional requirements of the information systems required&#13;
to support the functions. (See Annex D on page 45 for the&#13;
TOR describing this TA.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 19 --   Project Implementation Plan&#13;
ii.    Staffing, both executives and line staff. Beginning with the&#13;
chief executive, the management and staff will be hired&#13;
based on the approved organizational and functional design&#13;
laid out in the strategic analysis.&#13;
iii.   Since the depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities (VVS) do not already exist on the scale required to&#13;
support the privatization program and robust capital&#13;
markets, the project provides for a major development TA&#13;
effort to undertake: (i) legal and regulatory development;&#13;
(ii) organizational development; (iii) procedural and&#13;
administrative development; and (iv) staff development.&#13;
(The TOR describing the development TA will be prepared&#13;
based on the outcome of the strategic analysis.)&#13;
iv.    Facilities development. The project provides for the&#13;
acquisition of equipment and space for VVS staff and&#13;
business management.&#13;
v.    Operational Systems. Based on the strategic analysis, the&#13;
project will support the acquisition of the necessary&#13;
information systems to support the depository, registry,&#13;
clearing and settlement functions (e.g., hardware, software,&#13;
customization and implementation services). Given the&#13;
complexity of the functionality required, these technologies&#13;
will be procured using a two-stage ICB method. In addition&#13;
to funding the equipment, the project will provide for a&#13;
small amount of TA resources to help with the preparation&#13;
of the bidding documents and the evaluation processes.&#13;
(The TOR for this TA will be prepared based on the strategic&#13;
analysis.)&#13;
vi.   Securities Immobilization Program. Since the preliminary&#13;
system design entails the immobilization of existing physical&#13;
securities and the centralization of the firm-maintained share&#13;
registries, gathering and auditing these documents and&#13;
providing investors records of their holding is a major&#13;
undertaking (probably the most challenging of the entire&#13;
project). The project envisions a major TA effort to plan,&#13;
execute and audit this immobilization program. (The TOR&#13;
for this work will be prepared based on the strategic&#13;
analysis and the development TA.) Given the large number&#13;
of shares and shareholders, the project also provides for a&#13;
major goods procurement to print and distribute receipts for&#13;
the immobilized end centrally registered shares.&#13;
vii.   Customer Support. Since the depository, registry, clearing&#13;
and settlement facilities will create a new set of technical&#13;
and procedural requirements for the various participants in&#13;
the Croatian capital markets (e.g., exchanges, broker-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 20 --  Project Implementation Plan&#13;
dealers, issuers, corporations, institutional investors,&#13;
regulators, market observers, etc.), the project provides for&#13;
a limited number of customer terminals (to simplify&#13;
implementation) and for some TA on technical and&#13;
procedural matters.&#13;
viii.  Privatization Plan. As discussed above, the Government&#13;
wants to achieve private sector control over VVS as soon as&#13;
practically possible. Accordingly, the project provides for a&#13;
limited TA effort to assess the situation and prepare a&#13;
privatization plan. This will most probably be undertaken in&#13;
the last year of the project, once VVS is operational, has a&#13;
business record and the many factors which influence the&#13;
most appropriate approach have stabilized.&#13;
c.    Public Awareness Component. The Public Awareness Campaign&#13;
has three basic activities: (i) strategy and planning; (ii) media&#13;
development; and (iii) execution. A single large TA effort will&#13;
encompass the strategy and planning and the media development&#13;
activities, with a more limited involvement in the execution&#13;
activities. Campaign execution will be undertaken by the MOP.&#13;
Thus, reproduction and distribution of printed materials and&#13;
broadcast of television and radio productions will be procured via&#13;
separate goods procurements. Annex / on page 59 describes the&#13;
planning and development TA effort. This includes the preparation&#13;
of: (i) a strategic plan which will identify the substantive content&#13;
of the campaign, priorities, mix of mass media instruments,&#13;
integration and timing of dissemination; (ii) a media development&#13;
plan, which will specify how the materials will be developed and&#13;
the process carefully managed; and (iii) a dissemination plan, which&#13;
will specify how the broadcast and print material will be put before&#13;
the public and how this process will be managed. The TA will also&#13;
cover the preparation of the camera-ready print materials and the&#13;
broadcast-quality video and audio productions. In addition, the TA&#13;
will include a limited continuing effort to strengthen the MOP's&#13;
public relations capacity, including the capacity to conduct and&#13;
maintain public surveys.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;

MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Project Indicators&#13;
35.   Tracking key monitoring indicators is necessary to measure the impact of&#13;
the project inputs on the project's major development objectives. Given the&#13;
essential role program monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact&#13;
of a specific intervention on development objectives, three sets of indicators will&#13;
be used to monitor and evaluate progress during implementation of the Project:&#13;
outcome indicators, input indicators, and output indicators.&#13;
36.   Outcome Indicators. The project objectives are to facilitate the&#13;
transformation of the Croatian economy, primarily by supporting capital markets&#13;
institutions which lower the risks associated with securities markets.&#13;
Accordingly, direct measures of project effectiveness are impractical. However, a&#13;
number of indirect indicators of effectiveness are available, including trends in the&#13;
consolidation of enterprise ownership and the emergence of institutional and&#13;
strategic investors. In addition, project supervision will track:&#13;
a.    The elaboration of key securities regulations and operational&#13;
procedures, including:&#13;
i.    by-laws of CROSEC;&#13;
ii.   implementation regulations following from the Securities&#13;
Act;&#13;
iii.   guidelines for CROSEC staff conducting inspection of&#13;
investment firms, stock exchanges, brokers, dealers,&#13;
depositories, etc.; and&#13;
iv.   regulations and guidelines for confidentiality by CROSEC&#13;
staff.&#13;
b.    The impact of depository on securities activities, including the:&#13;
i.    number of enterprise share registries secured in the&#13;
depository;&#13;
ii.    number of physical certificates immobilized;&#13;
iii.   number of securities trades reflected in changed ownership&#13;
records in the depository;&#13;
iv.    number of tradeable instruments.&#13;
c.    The impact of the public awareness campaign, including:&#13;
i.    hours of electronic media air time;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   -_ 23 --     Project Implementation Plan&#13;
ii.    number of items of printed materials distributed to the&#13;
public.&#13;
37.   Input - Output Indicators will track: (i) planned investments in terms of&#13;
contracted technical assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-&#13;
months) in training programs, and procurement of goods; and (ii) items, such as&#13;
the number of studies or reports, that have been completed by a given date&#13;
during the project cycle. These indicators are shown on the next page in Table 9.&#13;

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   - 27 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
Capital Markets Development Project&#13;
Terms of Reference #1&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
for the&#13;
Establishment and Development of the Croatian&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC)&#13;
DRAFT: February 15, 1996&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    During 1993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful&#13;
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies brought&#13;
inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single digit annual&#13;
rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains, to address public&#13;
sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term, private sector led&#13;
growth, the govemment has been shifting socially operated enterprises into private&#13;
hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other methods. Currently, most of&#13;
the roughly three thousand enterprises have been corporatized and a large fraction of&#13;
the equity is held directly by about three quarters of a million citizens (out of a&#13;
population of four and a half million). Liberalization and stabilization have also&#13;
prompted an inflow of funds from the roughly two million diaspora Croats as well as&#13;
from the off-shore savings of residents.&#13;
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance and&#13;
economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist economies,&#13;
Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances equity, economic&#13;
efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and illiquid capital&#13;
markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the authorities' options.&#13;
The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the securities markets are&#13;
particular concerns, as are the inadequate common "back office" facilities to support&#13;
debt and equities trading. Together with the public's poor understanding of capital&#13;
markets, these weakness present serious risks to the ongoing economic&#13;
transformation program.&#13;
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested and received a loan of&#13;
approximately US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help finance&#13;
the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The project will:&#13;
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,&#13;
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and Exchange&#13;
Commission (CROSEC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 28 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities.&#13;
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their&#13;
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.&#13;
Objective of the Work&#13;
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)&#13;
required to achieve objective "a" above. Specifically these TOR cover the TA to&#13;
establish and develop the Croatian Securities and Exchange Commission&#13;
(CROSEC), in pursuant to the new Securities Act (December 14,1995).&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Whereas the covering Letter of Invitation specifies, among other things, the&#13;
budget for the work as well as the methods and procedures for evaluating proposal, it&#13;
is important to emphasize that: (i) the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the&#13;
"consultant") is encouraged to propose extensions, elaborations and refinements to&#13;
the work described below; and (ii) with in the allotted budget, the quality of the&#13;
consultant's proposed work program will be a central factor in the evaluation.&#13;
6.    Reporting and Communications. By the beginning of TA, the first&#13;
commissioner of CROSEC will be appointed and on site. Thus, this commissioner,&#13;
with the support of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), will be the consultant's primary&#13;
counterpart in Croatia. The commissioner and the MOF will provide the consultant&#13;
with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the various parties relevant to the&#13;
Croatian capital markets, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange, banks, brokers and&#13;
associations. The commissioner and the MOF will also ensure the appropriate level of&#13;
coordination of the TA with the other initiatives under the project. The consultant will&#13;
present their work to CROSEC, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee, which&#13;
has been established to oversee the project. In addition to the deliverables described&#13;
in the last section of these TOR, the consultant will present to CROSEC and the MOF&#13;
concise monthly progress reports which summarize findings, actions, open questions&#13;
and next steps. The last report will be a contract completion report, with&#13;
recommendations, if any, for a follow-up actions. The consultant will present this last&#13;
report to CROSEC, the MOF and Project Steering Committee no later than two&#13;
months after the end of the contract period.&#13;
7.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following minimum&#13;
qualifications:&#13;
a.    Extensive hands-on experience in OECD securities markets regulatory&#13;
bodies, including the legal, administrative and operational aspects.&#13;
Knowledge of comparative regulatory systems, emerging markets and&#13;
OECD systems, European Union standards and conventions, in&#13;
particular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 29 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
b.    Experience drafting and analyzing securities related legislation and&#13;
regulations. Experience in legal matters pertaining to compliance and&#13;
enforcement of financial regulations.&#13;
c.    Experience in the organization and management of securities markets&#13;
regulatory agencies.&#13;
d.    Experience organizing, running and developing private sector&#13;
enterprises and financial organizations.&#13;
e.    Experience designing, coordinating and conducting executive and staff&#13;
development programs for financial sector organizations.&#13;
f.    Knowledge of the peculiar circumstances of the transitional formerly&#13;
socialist economies, including the challenges of the political economy&#13;
and the financial systems in particular.&#13;
9.    Experience in leading and managing similar technical assistance&#13;
programs.&#13;
h.    Fluency in the Croatian Language (by, at minimum, one professional&#13;
team member).&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
8.    Timing. The TA should begin in December 1996 and continue until December&#13;
1998.&#13;
9.    Description of Work. The TA involves four major development thrusts:&#13;
(i) legal and regulatory; (ii) organizational; (iii) procedural and administrative; and&#13;
(iv) executive and staff skills. Broadly speaking, the legal, regulatory and&#13;
organizational work will be the focus of the first few months of the TA. This work will&#13;
guide the subsequent TA in the procedural, administrative and skills development&#13;
areas.&#13;
10.   The consultant will first survey the Croatian capital markets to: (i) identify the&#13;
types of financial instruments currently or potentially in use in the Croatian capital&#13;
markets; (ii) identify all the major participants in the market; (iii) identify individuals&#13;
within the participating firms and institutions with whom a working relationship can be&#13;
established; and (iv) canvas the participant's views of CROSEC's appropriate role in&#13;
developing and regulating Croatia's capital markets. These working relationships will&#13;
be critical to the success of the TA and the development of the Croatian capital&#13;
markets in general. The consultant will present the survey findings to the&#13;
commissioner, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee.&#13;
11.   The consultant will also immediately embark on a review of existing and&#13;
proposed legislation (including, but not limited to, the Securities Act, Investment Fund&#13;
Law, Company Act and legislation pertaining to the payments system). Based on this&#13;
review the consultant will prepare a number of written assessments,&#13;
recommendations and plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 30 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
a.    Legal functions and powers. The consultant will determine the&#13;
functions which CROSEC will carry out by law and its legal powers. In&#13;
tum, the consultant will identify, discuss and recommend areas of&#13;
responsibilities and powers which similar regulatory bodies possess in&#13;
OECD economies and, as appropriate, emerging markets.&#13;
b.    Legislative consistency. The consultant will identify areas of&#13;
inconsistency, ambiguity or other potential difficulties within the set of&#13;
relevant legislation. The consultant will also identify areas which may&#13;
conflict with intemational standards and best practices. The&#13;
consultant will identify specific options, discuss the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of each option, and recommended actions to resolve&#13;
these legal difficulties.&#13;
c.    Initial organization and staffing plan. The consultants will draft an&#13;
initial organization and staffing plan to match CROSEC's&#13;
responsibilities and the Croatian context. Organizational design must&#13;
address, but not be limited to: regulatory review, drafting and&#13;
research, regulatory enforcement, intemal and external review,&#13;
appeals, public and international relations.&#13;
d.    Basic action plan. The organizational and staffing plans will provide&#13;
the basis for a basic action plan to achieve the proposed&#13;
organizational design. The action plan will also include first estimates&#13;
of projected budgets for the next three years. In the context of the&#13;
budget projections, the consultant will also identify common and&#13;
appropriate revenue areas, including typical charges used in OECD&#13;
markets.&#13;
12.   Once the legislative survey and the above assessments and plans have been&#13;
approved by the commissioner, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee, the&#13;
consultant will assist CROSEC prepare a public statement regarding its policy and&#13;
approach to regulating the securities markets. This will be a clear statement of the&#13;
principles behind CROSEC's regulatory responsibilities and powers, market self-&#13;
regulation, disclosure requirements and enforcement mechanisms.&#13;
13.   Also, once the basic action plan has been approved, the consultant will start&#13;
drafting more detailed plans for institutional development work. This plan will include,&#13;
but not be limited to: (i) regulatory development, (ii) procedural development,&#13;
(iii) administrative development, (iv) executive and staff skills development.&#13;
14.    Pursuant to the new Securities Act, CROSEC has been charged with drafting&#13;
the secondary, implementing regulations for Croatian capital markets legislation.&#13;
These run the full spectrum of capital markets issues, from regulating (or permitting&#13;
self-regulation) of broker/dealers, to establishing listing requirements for publicly&#13;
traded companies. Thus, the regulatory development plan will need to address at a&#13;
minimum and without limitation:&#13;
a.    Conditions for admission of securities to stock exchange listings.&#13;
b.    Requirements for establishing stock exchanges.&#13;
c.    Disclosure requirements at the time of offering.&#13;
d.    Financial, auditing and other reporting requirements for listed and other&#13;
widely held companies. (The consultants should also assess reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 31 --      PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
arrangements for closely held companies and, if necessary,&#13;
recommend how they should be strengthened or changed.)&#13;
e.    Disclosure and acquisition or disposal of major holdings.&#13;
f.    Insider trading.&#13;
9.    Regulation of investment funds.&#13;
h.    Rights of minority shareholders.&#13;
i.    Enforcement mechanisms (fees, penalties etc.).&#13;
j.    Enforcement capacity (rights of seizure, etc.).&#13;
The consultant will also assist in the preparation of other capital market legislation&#13;
and regulations, including legislation relating to the clearing, payment and settlement&#13;
of securities, such as liability for wrongful or negligent actions taken in clearing,&#13;
paying and settling securities transactions.&#13;
15.   Each regulation creates a set of procedural requirements for CROSEC and&#13;
market participants. The consultant must, therefore, prepare plans to develop these&#13;
procedures, CROSEC's capacity to carry them out and the market participants'&#13;
understanding of their rights and responsibilities. If appropriate, the procedures&#13;
should be codified in an operations manual and promulgated through informational&#13;
pamphlets, bulletins or other such outreach mechanisms. The plan must cover the&#13;
development of professional codes of ethics, based on international best practices&#13;
and the particulars of the Croatian context. It must also cover the identification and&#13;
development of the necessary information systems tools to carry out CROSEC&#13;
supervisory and regulatory operations. These will need to be complemented with&#13;
methods to ensure effective working relations between CROSEC and other important&#13;
capital markets entities, such as the securities depository, registry, clearing and&#13;
settlement facilities, which is also being established through separate TA activities&#13;
under the project. The consultant will have to work closely with counterparts from the&#13;
various market participants, agencies and consultancies to ensure these methods are&#13;
acceptable and, thus, effective.&#13;
16.   CROSEC's organizational structure and its functional-procedural&#13;
responsibilities create a set of administrative requirements to manage and monitor&#13;
CROSEC operations. Thus, the consultant must also identify these requirements and&#13;
prepare a plan to develop CROSEC's administrative capacity. Among other things,&#13;
the plan must address reporting relationships and management functions. Detailed&#13;
staffing plans with job descriptions and qualifications must be specified. The plan&#13;
must also address the development of information systems to support management&#13;
functions (e.g., programs and budgeting, personnel, material management, etc.).&#13;
17.   As regulatory, procedural and administrative requirements emerge, these will&#13;
determine the requirements for executive and staff skills development. Accordingly,&#13;
the consultant will prepare a plan to conduct skills development programs as&#13;
CROSEC gains executives and staff over the duration of the TA.&#13;
18.   The executive development plan must address, but not be limited to:&#13;
(i) management practices; (ii) internationally accepted accounting principles;&#13;
(iii) company finances and record keeping; (iv) debt, equity, quasi-equity and off-&#13;
balance sheet instruments; (v) domestic and international capital markets;&#13;
(vi) regulation and enforcement techniques; (vii) financial sector institutions and&#13;
principles; (viii) employee-employer relations; and (ix) consensus building techniques&#13;
and communication skills. The consultant will also arrange study tours to European,&#13;
American and, as appropriate, emerging market securities regulators to see, on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 32 --      PIP Annex A: TOR #1&#13;
first-hand basis, regulation in action. To the extent possible, the consultant shall make&#13;
use of free training provided by some national securities regulators (such as the U.S.&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission's Emerging Markets Course). The separate&#13;
travel and subsistence budget for executive skill development during the TA period is&#13;
about US$75,000. This will be administered by the overall Project Implementation&#13;
Unit. However, the consultant is responsible for all other skills development expenses&#13;
out of the budget for this TA.&#13;
19.   Similarly, the staff skills development plan must address, but not be limited to:&#13;
(i) company structure and finances; (ii) internationally accepted accounting principles;&#13;
(iii) regulatory methods; (iv) debt, equity and quasi-equity instruments; (v) customer&#13;
relations and communications; and (vi) business and operational information systems.&#13;
During the implementation phase of the TA, the consultant will undertake the various&#13;
development plans, including skills development. However, a separate budget of&#13;
about US$150,000 will cover travel and subsistence costs for staff skills development.&#13;
This should support in-country training and study tours to selected regulatory&#13;
agencies in the region. As with the executive training, all other training expenses will&#13;
be covered by the budget for the TA.&#13;
20.   Following the action plan and based on the approved regulatory, procedural,&#13;
administrative and staff development plans, the consultant will implement the&#13;
regulatory, procedural, administrative and skills development plans during the period&#13;
of the TA. Although the regulatory development work will be ongoing, the core of the&#13;
work should be completed within the first three or four months of the assignment.&#13;
The bulk of the procedural development will follow closely the development of the&#13;
core regulations. However, of necessity, substantial procedural development will&#13;
extend over the TA period, as CROSEC develops its operational capacities and as&#13;
the capital markets develop from their relatively nascent states. Similarly, the&#13;
administrative and staff development work entail significant initial efforts to get&#13;
CROSEC started as an institution. However the bulk of the effort will stretch out over&#13;
the TA period, as CROSEC is staffed and its operational activities expand.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
21.   Deliverables under this TA contract are reports and presentations to the&#13;
relevant counterpart agencies. These reports will also be conveyed to the World&#13;
Bank by the project administration for the Bank's review. Thus, in addition to the&#13;
progress reports described in the paragraph on reporting and communications, the&#13;
deliverables for this TA (with approximate timings) are:&#13;
a.    Phase 1: Review and Planning.&#13;
i.    Initial survey of capital markets conditions and participants&#13;
(week 4).&#13;
ii.    Statement of CROSEC's legal functions and powers (week 6).&#13;

Technical Assistance for the Conversion of Govemment Debt&#13;
DRAFT: February 15, 1996&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In 1992, the Croatian banks received about US$1.1 billion worth of&#13;
govemment obligations -- the so-called "Big Bonds". These obligations are payable,&#13;
in Kuna, in forty semi-annual installments during 1992-2012. Interest is equal to the&#13;
rate of producer price inflation. Thirty-three installment payments are still due. Their&#13;
terms, however, make these obligations virtually non-tradable. The Govemment has&#13;
recently agreed with the banks on the need to convert them into tradeable securities.&#13;
This would permit the banks to sell them to other investors, including long-term&#13;
institutional investors (domestic and foreign), such as insurance companies, mutual&#13;
funds and pension funds. In addition to expanding the banks' portfolio management&#13;
options, this would also enhance the liquidity of the debt markets and, thus, help&#13;
clarify the structure of interest rates in Croatia.&#13;
2.   In the wake of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, commercial banks&#13;
also received government obligations of about US$2.2 billion to offset foreign&#13;
currency assets lost by the banks during the break up -- the so-called "Frozen&#13;
Deposits". These obligations are denominated in Deutsche Mark (or Kuna equivalent)&#13;
and are payable in twenty semi-annual installments, the first dated June 30, 1995,&#13;
with interest at five percent per annum. They are essentially illiquid, with a very small&#13;
secondary market. The Government has also expressed an interest in securitizing&#13;
these obligations.&#13;
3.   In early July 1995, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) contracted the services of a&#13;
local broker, INVESTCO, to prepare the design of new securities to replace the Big&#13;
Bonds. The proposal should be finalized by end-August 1995. The MOF and&#13;
INVESTCO felt the need for the services of an international debt securities expert (or&#13;
experts) to advise them on specific technical details concerning the design of these&#13;
securities and to help them in actual issuing of the bonds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 36 --   PIP Annex B: TOR #2&#13;
Objective of Work&#13;
4.    The United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) has made&#13;
funds available for the technical assistance (TA) described in these terms of&#13;
reference (TOR). Specifically, the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the&#13;
Mconsultant") would assist with the conversion of the Big Bonds. Once this effort is&#13;
underway, the Govemment may wish to address the problem of the Frozen Deposits.&#13;
Thus, the authorities may ask the selected consultant to prepare a proposal to extend&#13;
this assistance to cover the Frozen Deposits. However, the current assignment&#13;
applies only to the conversion of the Big Bonds.&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance will be the&#13;
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The MOF will provide the consultant with&#13;
guidance and facilitate their interactions with INVESTCO, the banks and other parties&#13;
relevant to the Croatian capital markets. The consultant(s) will present their work to&#13;
the MOF.&#13;
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will have the following qualifications:&#13;
a.    A demonstrated knowledge of the theory of modern public finance,&#13;
capital markets and commercial bank portfolio management.&#13;
b.    Extensive experience in structuring primary bond issues in OECD&#13;
countries.&#13;
C.    Experience in commercial bank portfolio management.&#13;
d.    Experience in public debt management.&#13;
Also, desirable qualifications include:&#13;
e.    Experience in structuring primary bond issues in transforming formerly&#13;
socialist economies.&#13;
f.    Experience issuing and trading Deutsche mark denominated&#13;
Eurobonds.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
7.    Timing. The assistance should commence as soon as possible and&#13;
conclude by end of June 1996.&#13;
8.    Description of Work. Certain features of the new securities, including the&#13;
maturity and interest rate, have been determined. Thus, the consultant(s) will&#13;
work with the MOF, INVESTCO and key representatives of the banking&#13;
community to define the features of the new securities, including, but not limited&#13;
to: fli type of bond, (e.g., zero coupon, annual, semi-annual, convertible, etc.);&#13;
(ii) currency of denomination; (iii) initial discount; (iv) amount of principal;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 37 --      PIP Annex B: TOR #2&#13;
(v) holder identification method (e.g., registered versus bearer form) and holder&#13;
restrictions; and (vi) supporting mechanisms, such as depository, registry,&#13;
clearing and settlement arrangements.&#13;
9.    In determining these features, the consultant will assess the impact of the&#13;
proposed conversion options on: (i) the state budget and (ii) the various banks'&#13;
incomes and balance sheets. The consultant will assess which conversion features&#13;
are the most interesting for domestic and international institutional investors. The&#13;
consultant(s) will also advise on technical details related to actual issuing of the&#13;
new securities and will provide assistance identifying potential international&#13;
institutional investors that may be interested in the new securities.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
10.   In the course of the assistance, the consultant will prepare the following&#13;
documents and present them to the MOF.&#13;
a.    An assessment of INVESTCO's proposal.&#13;
b.    A set of recommendations for the key features of the new&#13;
securities and the procedures required to support their issue and&#13;
trading.&#13;
c.    Projections of the impact on public debt and cash flow&#13;
management.&#13;
d.    Projections of the impact of the new securities on commercial bank&#13;
financial management, including, if necessary an assessment of the&#13;
impact on individual or groups of banks.&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
to the&#13;
Pension Fund in Managing Its Portfolio of Assets&#13;
DRAFT: February 15, 1996&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    During 1993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful&#13;
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies&#13;
brought inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single&#13;
digit annual rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains,&#13;
to address public sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term,&#13;
private sector led growth, the government has been shifting socially operated&#13;
enterprises into private hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other&#13;
methods. Currently, most of the roughly three thousand enterprises have been&#13;
corporatized and a large fraction of the equity is held directly by about three&#13;
quarters of a million citizens (out of a population of four and a half million).&#13;
Liberalization and stabilization have also prompted an inflow of funds from the&#13;
roughly two million diaspora Croats as well as from the off-shore savings of&#13;
residents.&#13;
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance&#13;
and economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist&#13;
economies, Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances&#13;
equity, economic efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete&#13;
and illiquid capital markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the&#13;
authorities' options.&#13;
3.    Institutionally, the Croatian Privatization Fund (CPF) and the Republic Fund&#13;
for Pension and Disability Insurance of Workers in Croatia ("The Pension Fund")&#13;
are important agents in the privatization program. Specifically, in the process of&#13;
privatizing enterprises, initially unsold shares are allocated to the CPF (two thirds)&#13;
and to the Pension Fund (one third). The CPF subsequently undertakes to place&#13;
these unsold shares through various methods. The share allocation for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 40 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3&#13;
Pension Fund goes to capitalizing the Fund, so that benefits are not exclusively&#13;
dependent on worker contributions and general budgetary resources.&#13;
4.    As of March 1995, the Pension Fund has received shares in over 1200&#13;
joint-stock companies, with a total nominal value of DM 3.5 billion. The&#13;
Pension Fund's equity stakes vary from negligible (0.06%) to up to a third.&#13;
However, most range between ten and twenty percent. The most significant&#13;
holdings include: one third of the oil company, JANAF, (nominal value&#13;
DM 247 million); one third of the pharmaceutical company, PLIVA, (nominal value&#13;
DM 233 million); and one quarter of the steel works, ZELJEZARA SISAK,&#13;
(nominal value DM 11 7 million). The draft of the new privatization law under&#13;
discussion in Parliament, envisages the Pension Fund also receiving a quarter of&#13;
the shares in the public utilities (nominal value about DM 12.5 billion). In&#13;
addition, the Pension Fund may be asked to manage shares that will be allocated&#13;
to current pensioners (several thousand DM worth per pensioner).&#13;
5.    Accordingly, the Pension Fund has and will receive a large and diverse&#13;
portfolio of shares to manage. Currently, the Pension Fund is trying to&#13;
"rationalize" its portfolio by selling shares in the companies that it does not want&#13;
to hold "permanently", via monthly public tenders (in which about 140 blocks of&#13;
shares have been sold to date). The Pension Fund's intention is to narrow its&#13;
portfolio to about 200 companies (in preferred sectors, such as tourism, catering&#13;
industry, food production, wood and timber processing ). This concentration, the&#13;
Pension Fund believes, will enable it to hold a significant proportion of a firm's&#13;
capital and, thus, exercise effective shareholder control. The Pension Fund also&#13;
envisages creating three separate sub-funds, organized either by beneficiary (fund&#13;
for workers, farmers and self-employed) or by sector (tourism, service companies,&#13;
industry, etc.).&#13;
6.    Notwithstanding these plans, the Pension Fund has relatively few skills&#13;
and limited experience in portfolio management. Accordingly, the Pension Fund&#13;
needs a substantial amount of external technical assistance to, among other&#13;
things: (i) improve its financial management; (ii) define the guidelines for future&#13;
operations of the proposed holding company and investment fund; and (iii) set up&#13;
and manage the holding company and the investment fund. This will require legal&#13;
and managerial advice, as well as long-term portfolio management assistance.&#13;
Objective of Work&#13;
7.   In support of these activities, the United States Agency for International&#13;
Development (USAID) has made funds available for the technical assistance (TA)&#13;
described in these terms of reference (TOR). Specifically, the consultant or&#13;
consulting firm (hereafter the "consultant") would assist the Pension Fund clarify&#13;
its portfolio management strategy and strengthen its portfolio management&#13;
operations.&#13;
8.    Note: this technical assistance does not cover the operational or strategic&#13;
aspects of the Pension Fund's benefits or contributions activities. These issues&#13;
are expected to be the subject of comprehensive review and reform, under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 41 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3&#13;
proposed World Bank Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL). These reforms&#13;
focus on introducing a multi-pillar arrangement for pensions: a pay-as-you-go,&#13;
minimum benefits First Pillar; a mandatory, funded Second Pillar of individual&#13;
retirement accounts; and a voluntary, privately funded Third Pillar. The&#13;
objectives are to: (i) create a fiscally sound pension system; (ii) diversify sources&#13;
of retirement income; (iii) link benefits and contributions more tightly; (iv) create&#13;
markets for long-term financial instruments; and (v) reduce reliance on external&#13;
funds. The contracted consultant must take these reforms into consideration in&#13;
the conduct of their portfolio management assistance.&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
9.    Reporting and Communications.  The Pension Fund will be the&#13;
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The Pension Fund will provide the&#13;
consultant with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the relevant parties&#13;
in the Croatian capital markets. The consultant will present their work to the&#13;
Pension Fund and the MOF, which is the prime counterpart for the proposed,&#13;
World Bank financed Capital Markets Developrnent Project, of which this USAID&#13;
financed assistance is an integral part.&#13;
10.   The MOF and the Project Steering Cormmittee, which will be established&#13;
under the Capital Markets Development Project, will also help the consultant liaise&#13;
with other consultancies working under this project on such initiatives as: (i) the&#13;
establishment of the Croatian Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC);&#13;
(ii) the establishment of securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities; and (iii) the design and conduct of a public awareness campaign relating&#13;
to privatization and the capital markets in general. Close interactions with these&#13;
initiatives will be critical for the success of the selected consultants' work, since&#13;
the Pension Fund's portfolio management strategy and operations will face&#13;
constraints such as: (i) few shares are currently quoted; (ii) the capital markets&#13;
are generally illiquid; (iii) corporate governance is underdeveloped; and (iv) the&#13;
financial situation of companies are typically weak and, therefore, the value of&#13;
underlying shares is highly uncertain as is their capacity to generate dividends.&#13;
11.    In addition to the deliverables described in the last section of these TOR,&#13;
the consultant will present to the Pension Fund, the MOF and the Project Steering&#13;
Committee concise monthly progress reports which summarize findings, actions,&#13;
open questions and next steps. The last report will be a contract completion&#13;
report, with recommendations, if any, for a follow-up actions. The consultant&#13;
will present this last report to the Pension Fund, the MOF and the Project&#13;
Steering Committee no later than two months after the end of the contract&#13;
period.&#13;
12.   Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following&#13;
minimum qualifications:&#13;
a.    Demonstrated knowledge of modern theory of portfolio&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 42 --    PIP Annex C: TOR #3&#13;
b.    Extensive experience the in design, management and operations of&#13;
large portfolios for institutional investors, such as pension funds&#13;
and life insurance companies, in OECD countries. Experience in&#13;
both Continental European and Anglo-American contexts.&#13;
c.    Extensive experience in emerging markets.&#13;
d.    Experience in investing in capital markets of transforming formerly&#13;
socialist economies.&#13;
e.    Demonstrated legal expertise and experience in establishing public&#13;
agencies and financial entities.&#13;
f.    Demonstrated expertise in organizing and managing similar&#13;
technical assistance in transitional or newly industrializing&#13;
environments.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
13.   Timing. Proposed duration of the assistance is one year, from August&#13;
1996 to August 1997. During this period, it is anticipated that a full time senior&#13;
advisor would remain on site and other specialist team members would visit as&#13;
interventions are required.&#13;
14.   Description of Work. The work has two basic phases: an assessment and&#13;
planning phase, lasting roughly two to three months; followed by an&#13;
implementation phase, involving the establishment of the proposed asset&#13;
management entity and the building of its asset management capacity.&#13;
15.   The consultant will begin by taking stock of the current and anticipated&#13;
circumstances of the Pension Fund's portfolio, the capital markets, the enterprise&#13;
sector and the proposed pension reforms. This will guide the formulation of a&#13;
basic vision statement for the Pension Fund's asset management capability,&#13;
objectives and strategy. This vision will recommend, among other things, the:&#13;
(i) Pension Fund's stance as an active versus passive investor, active versus&#13;
passive shareholder, a concentrated versus diverse investor, etc.; (ii) portfolio&#13;
objectives for asset management, such as income versus asset value growth,&#13;
balance of asset types, etc.; (iii) relationship between the Pension Fund and the&#13;
asset management entity; (iv) the scope for the asset management entity to&#13;
contract asset management services; and (v) evolution of these features, as&#13;
pension reform unfolds.&#13;
16.   Based on a government approved vision, with appropriate revisions as&#13;
necessary, the consultants will then devise an implementation plan, including, but&#13;
not limited to, a portfolio management plan, an organizational plan and a skills&#13;
development plan.&#13;
17.   Among other things, the portfolio management plan must address, among&#13;
other things: (i) re-balancing the composition of the portfolio from 100% equity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 43 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3&#13;
to a mix of equity, debt, property and money market investments; (ii) acquisition&#13;
and sales of equity in the imperfect market environment; (iii) ensuring flow of&#13;
dividends in imperfect accounting and legal environments; and (iv) assistance to&#13;
companies in further privatization and restructuring.&#13;
18.   The authorities envision the Pension Fund's portfolio management arm as&#13;
a wholly owned independent legal entity, with a separate management. Thus,&#13;
the consultants must analyze and recommend the most appropriate: (i) legal&#13;
structure of the entity; (ii) fiscal and legal basis of its operations; and&#13;
(iii) organizational structure, including overall management, internal and external&#13;
controls, external relations, etc. In addition, the consultant must prepare a&#13;
staffing plan, with management and staffing levels, plus job descriptions and&#13;
qualifications. Accordingly, the consultant may be called upon to help evaluate&#13;
and hire staff.&#13;
19.   The main difficulty will lay in building adequate executive and staff&#13;
capacities to manage this asset management entity and carry out its operations.&#13;
Thus, a critical part of the TA will be to devise and execute a skills development&#13;
plan covering, but not limited to: (i) asset management principles and techniques&#13;
prevailing both in Continental Europe and in Anglo-Saxon countries; (ii) corporate&#13;
finance and restructuring; (iii) other capital and property market investment&#13;
instruments and strategies; and (iv) investor relations.&#13;
20.   Since the Pension Fund's portfolio management entity may contract for&#13;
external fund managers, as assessed and decided upon through the basic vision&#13;
statement, the consultant must be prepared to, if appropriate, draft terms of&#13;
reference and assist the Pension Fund in contracting for such services.&#13;
Deliverables.&#13;
21.   In addition to direct assistance to the Pension Fund, the consultant will&#13;
prepare a set of documents for the Pension Fund and the Government for their&#13;
review, approval and revision. These include (with approximate timings):&#13;
a.    Phase 1: Assessment and Planning.&#13;
i.    Initial assessment (week 3).&#13;
ii.    Basic vision statement (week 5).&#13;
iii.   Portfolio management action plan (week 8).&#13;
iv.    Organizational action plan (week 10).&#13;
v.    Skills development action plan (week 12).&#13;

residents.&#13;
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance&#13;
and economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist&#13;
economies, Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances&#13;
equity, economic efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete&#13;
and illiquid capital markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the&#13;
authorities' options. The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the&#13;
securities markets are particular concerns, as are the inadequate common 'back&#13;
office" facilities to support debt and equities trading. Together with the public's&#13;
poor understanding of capital markets, these weakness present serious risks to&#13;
the ongoing economic transformation program.&#13;
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested a loan, currently&#13;
estimated at approximately US$9.5 million equivalent, from the World Bank&#13;
(IBRD) to help finance the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The&#13;
project will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 46         PIP Annex D: TOR #4&#13;
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,&#13;
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and&#13;
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).&#13;
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities.&#13;
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their&#13;
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.&#13;
Objective of Work&#13;
4.    In support of these activities and objective "b" in particular, the United&#13;
States Agency for International Development (USAID) has made funds available&#13;
for the technical assistance (TA) described in these terms of reference (TOR).&#13;
Specifically, the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the "consultant")&#13;
will formulate an actionable strategy to realize modern securities depository,&#13;
registry, clearing and settlement facilities. These will be realized under the&#13;
project with World Bank support.&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the&#13;
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The Ministry will provide the&#13;
consultant with guidance and facilitate its interactions with the various parties&#13;
relevant to the Croatian capital markets. The consultant will present its work to&#13;
the Ministry and the Project Steering Committee that will be established to&#13;
oversee the work.&#13;
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following&#13;
minimum qualifications:&#13;
a.    Comprehensive legal, regulatory, managerial and technical&#13;
experience in key capital market entities in OECD economies.&#13;
b.    Significant experience in institutional development in depository,&#13;
registry, clearing and settlements facilities, including organizational,&#13;
procedural and staff development.&#13;
c.    Knowledge of national capital markets strategies for transforming&#13;
formerly socialist economies.&#13;
d.    Extensive experience in the analysis of information systems in&#13;
capital markets institutions, including, but not restricted to,&#13;
securities registries and depositories, clearing, settlement and&#13;
supervisory agencies, as well as trading and corporate finance&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 47 --     PIP Annex D: TOR #4&#13;
e.    Knowledge of worldwide market for information technologies&#13;
relevant to the capital markets, particularly clearing, settlement,&#13;
book-entry, central securities depository and registration systems.&#13;
f.    Knowledge of public sector international competitive procurement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
7.    Timing. The TA should begin in March 1 996 and continue for about six&#13;
months.&#13;
8.    Description of Work. The consultant would start by preparing a review of&#13;
the current and anticipated structure of the Croatian capital markets (including&#13;
the new securities, company and investment fund laws). Among other things,&#13;
the consultant must take due note of the unusually large number of shareholders&#13;
and corporations, relative to the size of the population and the economy, as well&#13;
as the inexperience of capital market participants, shareholders, corporations,&#13;
brokers, banks, etc. This will have a major influence on the most appropriate&#13;
structures, procedures and timing of developments for the securities depository,&#13;
registry, clearing and settlement functions.&#13;
9.    Based on this review, the consultants will prepare:&#13;
a.    A basic vision for the securities depository, registry, clearing and&#13;
settlement functions. This would address fundamental issues,&#13;
such as centralization versus decentralization of these functions&#13;
(i.e., single versus multi-vault registries, final customer versus&#13;
custodial accounts) comprehensive versus selected coverage of&#13;
securities, gross versus net settlement, linkages to international&#13;
capital markets and the most appropriate arrangements for&#13;
guarantee schemes, among other issues. Where necessary, the&#13;
consultants will prepare a clear statement of the key open&#13;
questions that shape the basic architecture of the institutions and&#13;
relations for these functions. These may include access to the&#13;
depository/registry, handling of preemptive rights and other&#13;
regulatory restrictions on securities holdings, the synchronization of&#13;
trading among exchanges, among others questions. The basic&#13;
vision should also outline any necessary regulatory structures to&#13;
protect the public interest in the face of any potential monopolies&#13;
arising within the basic architecture.&#13;
b.    An analysis of the gaps in legal, regulatory, institutional, procedural&#13;
and human capital. In this regard, the consultants should take due&#13;
note of and work closely with the consulting team that will be&#13;
beginning regulatory and institutional development work for the&#13;
securities and exchange commission. Also, the consultant should&#13;
review and assess the current legislation regarding the&#13;
dematerialization of new securities issues and the immobilization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 48 --      PIP Annex D: TOR #4&#13;
and dematerialization of the existing physical securities. As&#13;
appropriate, the consultants should suggest elaborations or&#13;
adjustments to the codes.&#13;
c.    A set of recommendations regarding the remaining open questions&#13;
and approaches to close the identified gaps. These&#13;
recommendations must accord with international standards and&#13;
recommendations from the International Organization of Securities&#13;
Commission's Group of 30 and take into account the work of other&#13;
international professional organizations. They must also reflect the&#13;
relevant experiences of other countries in the region and recognize&#13;
Croatia's position as a small, open economy abutting the European&#13;
Union. The recommendations, for example, should address how&#13;
legal responsibilities should progress through the various stages of&#13;
the clearing and settlement processes. They should address&#13;
security, business continuity, auditing and confidentiality issues, as&#13;
well as public disclosure and supervisory linkages. The&#13;
recommendations should propose organizational plans, with&#13;
appropriate staffing levels and facilities requirement, and should&#13;
propose by-laws, codes of professional behavior and suggest key&#13;
procedures.&#13;
d.    A business model for the recommended facilities. This model&#13;
should provide implementation and operating costs projections,&#13;
suggested fee structures, five-year high-medium-low revenue&#13;
projections and approaches to gap financing. The plan must&#13;
address how the contributions of various agencies, such as the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, the Institute for Payment Transactions (ZZPP),&#13;
and the Croatian Privatization Fund, to the facilities implementation&#13;
and operation should be reflected in their capital and governance&#13;
structures and how such facilities can be privatized once&#13;
established and operational. The consultants should prepare a&#13;
draft charter for the facilities. However, if the time profile of&#13;
anticipated securities trading suggests that the optimal&#13;
arrangements will have to change over, say, five years (e.g., shifts&#13;
from centralized to distributed registries), this should be reflected in&#13;
the plans.&#13;
e.    A detailed action plan to achieve operational securities depository,&#13;
registry, clearing and settlement facilities, including a phased&#13;
transitional plan, time table and assessable milestones to move to&#13;
the recommended configuration from the current situation. This&#13;
should address all the relevant aspects of organizational&#13;
development, staffing, procedural, and facilities development.&#13;
Among other things, the consultants should identify opportunities&#13;
for "twinning" the Croatian facilities with comparable facilities in&#13;
other countries. Also, securities immobilization and data&#13;
acquisition (from ZZPP, Croatian Privatization Fund, corporations,&#13;
public issues, etc.) programs also must be specified in detail. This&#13;
includes auditing procures and responsibilities as well as cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   - 49 --    PIP Annex D: TOR #4&#13;
effective methods to provide investors with documentation of their&#13;
immobilized/dematerialized holdings.&#13;
f.    A detailed statement of functional requirement for information&#13;
systems to support the depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
functions. This should be based on a catalog of information and&#13;
flows for all capital market transactions which result in depository,&#13;
registry, clearing or settlement actions. These functional&#13;
requirements will be used to prepare international competitive&#13;
bidding documents to procure the necessary technologies and&#13;
services to implement these facilities. The consultants will also&#13;
provide a review of the market for relevant information systems&#13;
products and services, including estimated costs for the required&#13;
systems. Note: Pending the outcome of the work and the&#13;
availability of Republic of Croatia or World Bank resources, the&#13;
assignment may be extended to prepare procurement documents&#13;
and advise a project implementation unit on the evaluation of bids.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
10.   Deliverables (with approximate timing) under this TA contract are reports&#13;
and presentations to inter-agency steering committees and key capital market&#13;
participants:&#13;
a.    Initial Review and Basic Vision (month 1)&#13;
b.    Gap Analysis (month 2)&#13;
c.    Recommendations (month 3)&#13;
d.    Business Model (month 4)&#13;

Design and Development of a Public Awareness Campaign&#13;

Improve the General Public's Understanding of the Capital Markets&#13;
DRAFT: February 15, 1996&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    During 1 993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful&#13;
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies&#13;
brought inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single&#13;
digit annual rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains,&#13;
to address public sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term,&#13;
private sector led growth, the government has been shifting socially operated&#13;
enterprises into private hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other&#13;
methods. Currently, most of the roughly three thousand enterprises have been&#13;
corporatized and a large fraction of the equity is held directly by about three&#13;
quarters of a million citizens (out of a population of four and a half million).&#13;
Liberalization and stabilization have also prompted an inflow of funds from the&#13;
roughly two million diaspora Croats as well as from the off-shore savings of&#13;
residents.&#13;
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance&#13;
and economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist&#13;
economies, Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances&#13;
-equity, economic efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and&#13;
illiquid capital markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the&#13;
authorities' options. The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the&#13;
securities markets are particular concerns, as are the inadequate common "back&#13;
office" facilities to support debt and equities trading. Together with the public's&#13;
poor understanding of capital markets, these weakness present serious risks to&#13;
the ongoing economic transformation program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 60 --     PIP Annex 1: TOR #9&#13;
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested and received a loan of&#13;
approximately US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help&#13;
finance the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The project will:&#13;
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,&#13;
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and&#13;
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).&#13;
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities.&#13;
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their&#13;
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.&#13;
Objective of the Work&#13;
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)&#13;
required to achieve objective "c" above. Specifically, these TOR cover TA to devise&#13;
a public awareness campaign and develop the supporting print and electronic&#13;
materials. Reproduction and distribution of printed materials and the broadcast of&#13;
radio and television programs are not part of the TA and, thus, are not to be covered&#13;
by the budget for this assistance, which is approximately US$0.7 million.&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Whereas the covering Letter of Invitation specifies, among other things, the&#13;
budget for the work as well as the methods and procedures for evaluating proposal, it&#13;
is important to emphasize that: (i) the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the&#13;
"consultant") is encouraged to propose extensions, elaborations and refinements to&#13;
the work described below; and (ii) with in the allotted budget, the quality of the&#13;
consultant's proposed work program will be a central factor in the evaluation.&#13;
6.    Restrictions. As detailed in the consulting contract, all materials created&#13;
under this TA contract will remain the sole property of the Republic of Croatia.&#13;
Re-use of the materials will require the formal, written approval of the&#13;
Government.&#13;
7.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) will&#13;
be the consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The MOP will provide the&#13;
consultant with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the various parties&#13;
relevant to the Croatian capital markets, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange,&#13;
banks, brokers and associations. The MOP will also ensure the appropriate level&#13;
of coordination of the TA with the other initiatives under the project. The&#13;
consultant will present their work to the MOP, Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the&#13;
Project Steering Committee, which has been established to oversee the project.&#13;
In addition to the deliverables described in the last section of these TOR, the&#13;
consultant will present to the MOP concise monthly progress reports which&#13;
summarize findings, actions, open questions and next steps. The last report will&#13;
be a contract completion report, with recommendations, if any, for a follow-up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 61 --     PIP Annex l: TOR #9&#13;
actions. The consultant will present this last report to the MOP and Project&#13;
Steering Committee no later than two months after the end of the contract&#13;
period.&#13;
8.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following&#13;
minimum qualifications:&#13;
a.    International experience in design and implementation of public&#13;
education or public awareness campaigns, including the&#13;
management of interdisciplinary teams and sub-contractors.&#13;
b.    Thorough knowledge of OECD financial systems and capital&#13;
markets in particular.&#13;
c.    Practical experience with the peculiar circumstances of the&#13;
transforming formerly socialist economies.&#13;
d.    Thorough knowledge of and extensive experience with the graphic&#13;
and video arts as well as the editorial and pedagogical fields.&#13;
e.    Thorough understanding of the Croatian society, culture, language,&#13;
history, economic and political situation.&#13;
f.    Fluency in the Croatian Language (by, at minimum, one&#13;
professional team member).&#13;
Accordingly, the consultant are encouraged to incorporate Croatian nationals and&#13;
firms into the team, including local graphics and video production resources.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
9.    Timing. The TA should begin in September 1996 and continue for about&#13;
six months, followed by more limited, period interventions through December&#13;
1998.&#13;
10.   Description of Work. The work divides into three stages. In the first, the&#13;
consultants will prepare a strategic plan, a media development plan and a&#13;
dissemination plan. The second stage involves the creation of an integrated set&#13;
of printed and electronic educational materials. The third stage entails a more&#13;
limited assistance to the MOP to help execute the reproduction and dissemination&#13;
activities. As usual, continuation of the TA from one stage to the next will be&#13;
contingent on the satisfactory performance of the earlier stage. Also, depending&#13;
on the perceived need, the Government may ask the consultant to prepare a&#13;
proposal to somewhat expand the third stage assistance. Thus, a consultant's&#13;
initial proposal should specify the anticipated effort levels and relevant fees for&#13;
the various categories of consultants for each of the three stages.&#13;
11.   During the first stage, the consultant will assess the current situation in&#13;
Croatia, in terms of the state of the capital markets and the public's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 62 --     PIP Annex 1: TOR #9&#13;
comprehension and attitudes. Based on this assessment, the consultant will&#13;
prepare an overall strategic plan for the campaign. This strategic plan will&#13;
include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the scope of the substantive&#13;
"curriculum", priorities among the substantive topics, the best mix of various&#13;
types of printed and electronic media materials, the optimum degree of&#13;
integration among the materials, most appropriate timing of dissemination&#13;
activities, and mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of the program.&#13;
12.   Once approved by the MOP and the Project Advisory Committee, the&#13;
strategic plan will guide the preparation of a media development plan. This&#13;
would specify in detail, among other things, the array of printed and electronic&#13;
materials to be created in the second stage, the substantive content of the&#13;
various materials, how these will be created and how the whole process will be&#13;
managed and coordinated. This development plan will also require the approval&#13;
of the MOP and the Project Advisory Committee, before the consultant turn to&#13;
preparing the dissemination plan.&#13;
13.   Since the MOP, with the assistance of the Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU), will separately procure the reproduction, distribution and broadcast&#13;
services, the dissemination plan will include, but not be limited to, specifying the&#13;
most effective method and timing to disseminate the materials, how to monitor&#13;
and coordinate these activities, and what public relations capacities the MOP will&#13;
need to complement the PAP materials.&#13;
14.   As soon as possible during the first stage, the consultant should undertake&#13;
a preliminary benchmark survey to find out the existing public perceptions of and&#13;
expectations for the capital markets and privatization. It will also gather&#13;
information on the interests of the various groups as they relate to the capital&#13;
markets and privatization, such as current voucher holders, enterprise managers,&#13;
workers, pensioners, and entrepreneurs. Among other things, the survey should&#13;
identify what type of media (television, newspapers, radio) people prefer to&#13;
receive information from. In addition, a practical program of periodic, follow-on&#13;
surveys should be devised. Bidders should elaborate on the scale, content,&#13;
method and frequency of this survey program as part of their proposals, clearly&#13;
identifying what the consultants propose to undertake and what would be the&#13;
responsibilities of the MOP and others.&#13;
1 5.  In devising the substantive content of the campaign, the objective of the&#13;
mass education campaign is to familiarize the public with the objectives and&#13;
functions of capital markets. This includes its instruments, institutions, practices&#13;
and procedures, as well as the rights and responsibilities of share and bond&#13;
holders. Thus, the campaign must educate the general public (in contrast to&#13;
market professionals) on such topics as:&#13;
a.    Basic economic relations in a market economy.&#13;
b.    Corporate and other forms of enterprise management and&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 63 --        PIP Annex 1: TOR #9&#13;
c.    The roles financial institutions, including banks, stock and bond&#13;
markets, supervisory and rating agencies, institutional investors,&#13;
etc.&#13;
d.    Privatization methods, including mass (voucher) privatization,&#13;
auctions, flotation, management buyouts, etc.&#13;
e.    Types of securities, e.g., stock, bonds, derivatives, options, etc.&#13;
f.    Basic financial terminology: shares, bonds, EPS, PER, market&#13;
versus book value, etc.&#13;
9.    Legal rights of share and bond holders.&#13;
h.    Reporting requirements and obligations of a joint-stock company.&#13;
Procedures to trade securities, including role of stock exchange,&#13;
brokers, banks and others.&#13;
i.    Specific procedures relating to other capital market development&#13;
initiatives under the project, including the development of the&#13;
securities and exchange commission and the development of&#13;
securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities.&#13;
An important part of this second initiative is a program to&#13;
immobilize physical securities and centralize existing share&#13;
registries. This will require integration into the campaign.&#13;
k.    Basics of investment and portfolio management, including open&#13;
and close-ended investment funds, pension funds, etc.&#13;
I.    International linkages with the domestic capital market.&#13;
16.   The consultant will be responsible for identifying and organizing other&#13;
substantive topics as part of their proposal and, in conjunction with Croatian&#13;
counterparts, during the conduct of the TA.&#13;
17.   In addition to creating the public awareness materials (e.g., camera-ready&#13;
print materials and broadcast quality video and audio tapes) during the second&#13;
stage, the consultant will also help strengthen the MOP public relations capacity,&#13;
by, among other things, helping prepare job descriptions, training and advising&#13;
MOP staff, as well as building MOP capacities to conduct and maintain public&#13;
surveys.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
18.   Deliverables under this TA contract are reports, presentations and printed&#13;
and electronic material ready for reproduction and broadcast. In addition to the&#13;
monthly progress reports the deliverables (with approximate timings) are:&#13;

Background&#13;
1.    Croatia's privatization program is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal&#13;

Croatia is struggling to devise a strategy that balances equity, economic efficiency&#13;
and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and illiquid capital markets&#13;

2.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested a loan of approximately&#13;
US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help finance the costs of the&#13;
Capital Markets Development Project. USAID has also pledged approximately&#13;
US$1 million in grants to fund selected technical assistance efforts within the scope of&#13;
the project. The Capital Markets Development Project will:&#13;
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,&#13;
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and Exchange&#13;
Commission (CROSEC).&#13;
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities.&#13;
C.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their&#13;
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.&#13;
3.    In addition, the project will establish and support a Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU). With a staff of about two or three, the PIU will administer the procurement,&#13;
disbursement, reporting and coordination activities relating to the project components&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 66 --   PIP Annex J: TOR #10&#13;
and the relevant interactions between the Government and the World Bank and, as&#13;
appropriate, USAID. The Govemment will also establish a Project Steering&#13;
Committee, to which most of the TA work under the various components will be&#13;
presented for decisions and guidance on matters of policy and substance. In&#13;
addition, each of the three project components will have a small team to directly carry&#13;
out and manage the detailed work in the components. (See Figure 1 on page 69 for&#13;
implementation arrangements.)&#13;
Objective of the Work&#13;
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)&#13;
required to lead the PIU and accordingly, help ensure that project achieves each&#13;
of the above three objectives "a", "b" and "c".&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the&#13;
consultant's client in Croatia.&#13;
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will have the following minimum qualifications:&#13;
a.    Extensive experience in managing and administering large, multi-&#13;
million dollar projects, involving multiple sub-projects, contractors and&#13;
agencies.&#13;
b.    Experience in project management in both the public and private&#13;
sectors.&#13;
C.    Experience with competitively bid procurements.&#13;
d.    Experience in disbursement and audit procedures.&#13;
Desirable qualifications also include:&#13;
e.    Demonstrated knowledge of the financial sector and the capital&#13;
markets in particular.&#13;
f.    Fluency in the Croatian Language.&#13;
9.    Experience with World Bank financed projects.&#13;
7.    Training, however, will be available on World Bank procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures for the PIU Head and PIU staff. Depending on timing of&#13;
project activities, course schedules and developments in other World Bank projects in&#13;
Croatia, the training is likely to be a mix of short, one to two week programs overseas&#13;
and/or in country. If possible, these will be coordinated with training for the two-&#13;
member loan administration team that is expected to established in the Foreign&#13;
Relations Department of the MOF under the proposed Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
This team and the PIU will coordinate activities. The PIU is likely to be tasked with&#13;
managing common procedures among this project and others under consideration.&#13;

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 71 --     PIP Annex K: TOR #11&#13;
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
Capital Markets Development Project&#13;
Terms of Reference #11&#13;
Project Steering Committee&#13;
DRAFT: February 15, 1996&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Croatia's privatization program is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal&#13;
balance and economic growth. Like all transforming formerly socialist economies,&#13;
Croatia is struggling to devise a strategy that balances equity, economic&#13;
efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and illiquid capital&#13;
markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the authorities'&#13;
options. The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the securities&#13;
markets are particular concerns, as are the inadequate common "back office"&#13;
facilities to support debt and equities trading. Together with the public's poor&#13;
understanding of capital markets, these weakness present serious risks to the&#13;
ongoing economic transformation program.&#13;
2.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested a loan of approximately&#13;
US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help finance the costs&#13;
of the Capital Markets Development Project. USAID has also pledged&#13;
approximately US$1 million in grants to fund selected technical assistance efforts&#13;
within the scope of the project. The Capital Markets Development Project will:&#13;
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,&#13;
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and&#13;
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).&#13;
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement&#13;
facilities.&#13;
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their&#13;
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.&#13;
3.    In addition, the project will establish and support a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU). With a staff of about two or three, the PIU will administer the&#13;
procurement, disbursement, reporting and coordination activities relating to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 72 --   PIP Annex K: TOR #11&#13;
project components and the relevant interactions between the Government and&#13;
the World Bank and, as appropriate, USAID. The Government will also establish a&#13;
Project Steering Committee, to which most of the TA work under the various&#13;
components will be presented for decisions and guidance on matters of policy&#13;
and substance. In addition, each of the three project components will have a&#13;
small team to directly carry out and manage the detailed work in the&#13;
components. (See Figure 1 on page 74 for implementation arrangements.)&#13;
Objective of the Work&#13;
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the roles and responsibilities of the&#13;
Project Steering Committee. Thus, the objective of the work is to ensure that the&#13;
project successfully achieves each of the above three objectives "a", "b" and "c".&#13;
General Responsibilities&#13;
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Project Steering Committee (the&#13;
Committee) will report to and advise Ministry of Finance (MOF) on matters&#13;
relating to the Capital Markets Development Project. The Assistant Minister of&#13;
Finance will chair the Committee.&#13;
6.    Composition and Qualifications. The Committee will be composed of&#13;
senior representatives of the major participants in the Capital Market, such as:&#13;
a.    Exchanges&#13;
b.    Broker/dealers.&#13;
c.    Banks.&#13;
d.    Institutional investors.&#13;
e.    The enterprise sector / chamber of commerce&#13;
f.    Republic and other public bond issuers.&#13;
g.    Croatian Fund for Privatization.&#13;
h.    Domestic Payment Institute (ZZPP) I National Bank of Croatia.&#13;
i.    The legal profession / judicial system .&#13;
j.    Financial media.&#13;
7.    The Committee will be responsible for reviewing and deliberating upon a&#13;
substantial amount of material and presentations that will profoundly shape the&#13;
financial system in Croatia. Accordingly, members must be prepared: (i) to&#13;
dedicate time and energy to the Committee's work; (ii) to even-handedly&#13;
represent the broad community for which they stand; yet, (iii) to represent the&#13;
national interest, as it may differ somewhat from the interests of that&#13;
community; (iv) to work effectively and consensually with the Committee's&#13;
representatives from the other communities within and related to the capital&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Scope of Work&#13;
8.    Timing. The Committee will form as soon as possible and be active during&#13;
the duration of the project, which currently runs through the end of 1998.&#13;
9.    Description of Work. The primary function the Committee will be to&#13;
gather the wisdom and interests in the Croatian capital markets to guide the&#13;
many activities under the three components of the Capital Markets Development&#13;
Project: policy support, infrastructure development and public awareness. This&#13;
will primarily take place by the Committee (and sub-committees) regularly&#13;
meeting to:&#13;
a.    Review materials and presentations by the various project teams,&#13;
consultants and suppliers (as coordinated by the PIU). Assess the&#13;
validity of analyses and the appropriateness of the proposed strategies&#13;
and action plans.&#13;
b.    Actively participate in any necessary work to revise and refine the&#13;
proposals and action plans.&#13;
c.    Provide recommendations, guidance and, as appropriate, decision&#13;
making on matters of substance and priority which the teams will put&#13;
before the Committee (in coordination with the PIU).&#13;
d.    Recommend MOF approval/ or rejection of selected far-reaching&#13;
documents, such as strategies, action plans and key terms of&#13;
reference, technical specifications and other documents.&#13;
e.    Assess adequacy of contracted work undertaken. Manage the&#13;
project's Mid-Term Review in September 1997.&#13;
f.    Help the PIU monitor the substantive progress of the project teams,&#13;
consultants and suppliers.&#13;
9.    Communicate the project activities and rationales to constituencies&#13;
within each committee members community and to the public at large.&#13;
10.   Support to the Committee will come in the form of: (i) secretariat services&#13;
by the PIU, including the preparation of meeting minutes and circulation of&#13;
agendas, management of documents and relevant data, etc.; and (ii) ad hoc&#13;
technical assistance and study tours to provide the membership with the&#13;
adequate knowledge and exposure to make carefully informed decisions and&#13;
recommendations on matters put before the Committee.&#13;

            The objectives of the Capital Markets
            Development Project are to strengthen key government areas,
            including: (a) the regulatory and policy framework of the
            capital markets; (b) the infrastructure to support
            securities transactions; and (c) the public's
            understanding of the capital markets and their roles as
            shareholders of privatized firms. The project consists of
            three components. The policy support component supports
            development of a legal and regulatory framework. The
            infrastructure development component provides technical
            assistance, equipment and facilities investments to
            establish and strengthen the securities depository,
            registry, clearing and settlement facilities. Finally, the
            public awareness component provides technical assistance to
            devise, develop and execute a mass media public awareness
            campaign. The campaign seeks to improve the general
            public's understanding of the capital markets and of
            their role and rights as participants.
