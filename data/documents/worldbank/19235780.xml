6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
September 30, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement (other than returns to Donors) after such&#13;
date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Arrangements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank will return any remaining&#13;
balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Arrangement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by&#13;
such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding&#13;
Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;
Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and not yet&#13;
paid) that are not committed pursuant to any arrangements entered into between the Bank and any&#13;
consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement, including any&#13;
Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank will return to&#13;
the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Arrangement; unless&#13;
otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank will disclose the Administration Arrangements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Arrangements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Arrangements and&#13;
such related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank will use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;
claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Arrangements.&#13;

ï»¿8.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
8.1    The Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into one or more&#13;
grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with the purposes of&#13;
this Administration Arrangement and on the provisions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant&#13;
Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors have agreed&#13;
to make available under the Administration Arrangements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
8.2    The Bank will be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be invited&#13;
by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
8.3    The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the provisions of any&#13;
Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the Donors the opportunity to exchange views&#13;
before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
