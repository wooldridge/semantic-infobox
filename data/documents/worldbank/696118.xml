FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A. Sector Background&#13;
General&#13;
1.1       Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest and most densely populated&#13;
countries, having an estimated 1995 population of about 120 million people, with&#13;
about 96 million (80%) living in rural areas. The country faces massive urban&#13;
population growth challenges due to rural to urban migration, resulting from&#13;
increased rural landlessness, lack of opportunities in rural areas and the effect&#13;
of natural disasters in rural areas. It is estimated that between 1974 to 1981,&#13;
the urban population growth rate was 10.6% per annum, declining to 5.4% per annum&#13;
between 1982 to 1990, compared to a total population growth rate of about 2.4%&#13;
annually during the later period. About 8.0 million of the urban population live&#13;
in the Dhaka metropolitan area, representing about 30% of the total urban&#13;
population. The disproportionate rise in the urban population has created severe&#13;
pressure on existing infrastructure and services, including water supply,&#13;
sanitation, solid waste collection and drainage services.  The environmental&#13;
conditions throughout most of the urban areas of Bangladesh are poor, with&#13;
discharges of human and industrial wastes into river systems, possible&#13;
contamination of groundwater from lack of adequate sewerage, and inadequate&#13;
management of solid waste disposal. These problems are particularly severe in&#13;
Dhaka, where the population growth rate is comparatively high and where it is&#13;
estimated that about 45% of the households have incomes below the poverty line.&#13;
The size of the urban population, combined with limited financial resources, puts&#13;
constraints on the development of adequate urban infrastructure, particularly&#13;
water supply and sanitation.&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
1.2       Bangladesh is located in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta, one of&#13;
the largest in the world. The hydrology of Bangladesh is characterized by three&#13;
major rivers, the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and the tributaries forming the Meghna.&#13;
The country experiences heavy rainfall during the monsoon, generally more than&#13;
1,500 mm annually.  This results in abundant surface water, which is usually&#13;
polluted and requires full treatment involving clarification, rapid sand&#13;
filtration and disinfection.   A very high incidence of diarrhoeal and other&#13;
waterborne diseases reflects the extent of contamination in the surface water and&#13;
the extensive use of untreated water from streams, rivers and shallow tubewells.&#13;
Most of the country, however has underlying sedimentary deposits containing&#13;
aquifers, which are the main source of groundwater. This water requires little&#13;
treatment and is used by public water utilities and private institutions as a&#13;
major source of supply. In the Dhaka metropolitan area, about 95% of the water&#13;
supplied by the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) is from&#13;
groundwater sources. However, over-abstraction in places, e.g. Central Dhaka,&#13;
is causing water tables to decline rapidly, resulting in increased abstraction&#13;
costs, limited water availability in the dry season in some areas, and widespread&#13;
failure of shallow tubewells.  As a result, there is an increasing need to&#13;
supplement groundwater sources with treated surface water sources. In addition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to these water sources, analysis of oil well logs has demonstrated that there is&#13;
a high probability of finding fresh water in several deep artisan aquifers&#13;
underlying Dhaka and other areas in Bangladesh at depths of about 2,000 meters&#13;
(6,560 feet). Potentially, these aquifers could provide partial water supply f or&#13;
Dhaka.   Investigations as to the existence of these aquifers have not been&#13;
undertaken, and it is believed that initial development costs could be&#13;
substantial.  Nevertheless, the Government regards this source as a possible&#13;
long-term alternative to current water supply sources in Dhaka and the rest of&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
Water SuPplY and Sanitation Coverage&#13;
1.3       Although accurate data is not readily available, most of the existing&#13;
water supply services in Bangladesh are not capable of meeting demand&#13;
requirements.   It is estimated that in the urban areas, about 42% of the&#13;
population has access to reasonably safe water, but the remaining 58% depend on&#13;
contaminated traditional sources. In rural areas, it is estimated that 77% of&#13;
the population has access to improved water supply through handpumps. Coverage&#13;
is higher in rural areas because of an intensive tubewell installation program&#13;
supported by UNICEF (para. 1.8).&#13;
1.4       With regard to sanitation, waterborne sewerage has been introduced&#13;
only in parts of Dhaka, but elsewhere, there is general use of unsanitary&#13;
latrines, direct disposal of sewage in open fields and to a limited extent, pit&#13;
latrines and septic tanks. In urban areas, it is estimated that about 40% of the&#13;
urban population has access to sanitary waste disposal services.   The rural&#13;
sanitation situation is much less satisfactory, with only 6% of the rural&#13;
population having access to sanitary waste disposal facilities. Because of the&#13;
limited sewerage systems and the inefficient sanitary waste disposal facilities,&#13;
untreated or poorly treated domestic sewage is a major source of water pollution,&#13;
and the morbidity/mortality rate due to waterborne diseases in Bangladesh is&#13;
among the highest in the world.&#13;
B. Sector Organization&#13;
1.5       The statutory responsibility for the water supply and sanitation&#13;
sector is under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and&#13;
Cooperatives (MLGRDC). The Ministry, together with the Planning Commission share&#13;
the tasks of sectoral resource allocation, funding and policy decisions, as well&#13;
as project appraisal, approval, evaluation and monitoring. All projects in the&#13;
sector are processed through the Ministry. The Ministry's Department of Public&#13;
Health Engineering (DPHE) is responsible for planning, construction and operating&#13;
water supply and sanitation facilities in smaller towns and rural areas.  In&#13;
Dhaka and Chittagong, the Government established Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Authorities (DWASA and CWASA) as autonomous agencies responsible for provision&#13;
of water supply and sewerage services. These authorities also come under MLGRDC&#13;
as public utilities. DWASA is also responsible for stormwater drainage in Dhaka.&#13;
In the two cities, the Dhaka and the Chittagong City Corporations (DCC, CCC) are&#13;
responsible for all other sanitation activities other than waterborne sewerage.&#13;
Additionally, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), also under the&#13;
Ministry, is responsible for providing technical assistance to sanitation and&#13;
other municipal services to district towns that do not have municipal corporation&#13;
status. DPHE and LGED assist local governments to construct water supply and&#13;
sanitation facilities,  either through donor or Government financing.   The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
mandates of these two agencies are not very clear, and their responsibilities&#13;
overlap at the district and town level. DPHE lacks adequate manpower and the&#13;
institutional capacity to provide support to the projects it implements in&#13;
district towns. As a result, most of its schemes are not sustainable. LGED has&#13;
better implementation capacity; however, its focus has been on physical&#13;
implementation aspects rather than improvement of the institutional capacity of&#13;
the municipalities.&#13;
C. Sector Financing&#13;
1.6       Sector development in Bangladesh has mainly been financed by donor&#13;
assistance, which has been mainly responsible for the tenfold increase (from a&#13;
low base) in availability of water supply. Although the Government has declared&#13;
its intention to develop safe water supply and sanitation, the level of&#13;
investment in the sector has remained very low due to funding constraints.&#13;
Between 1973 and 1990, public outlays for water and sanitation steadily dropped&#13;
from 2.48Z, 2.14% to 1.25% of development expenditures in the first, second and&#13;
third five-year plans respectively. This is significantly below allocations in&#13;
other comparable countries in Asia, e.g., Sri Lanka (6.0%), Nepal (4.0%) and&#13;
Myannmar (2.9%). In the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1990-1995), allocations to the&#13;
sector were budgeted to be 1.41% of the development expenditure, which is too low&#13;
even to meet the physical targets of the plan.   The most recent three-year&#13;
rolling investment program (TYRIP) for FY95-97, however, shows a reversal to this&#13;
trend. Allocations for this period were 4% of the total expenditure.&#13;
1.7       IDA has been the main donor in the urban water supply sub-sector,&#13;
having financed a total of five projects, (two in Chittagong and three in Dhaka),&#13;
for a total investment of US$108 million. The basic objective of these projects&#13;
was to improve the level of water supply services in the cities of Dhaka and&#13;
Chittagong and the efficiency and performance of the utilities.   The Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB) has been involved in financing water supply and urban&#13;
infrastructure in secondary towns and districts. In addition, ADB has also been&#13;
involved in an Urban Infrastructure Improvement Project in Dhaka, which includes&#13;
a component being implemented by DWASA, to provide water supply in low cost&#13;
housing areas. The Netherlands Government has also assisted the Government with&#13;
two projects (12 District Towns Project and 18 District Towns Project) to improve&#13;
water supply and sanitation focusing on extension of hygiene education, service&#13;
expansion and community involvement.&#13;
1.8       In the rural water supply and sanitation sub-sector,  development&#13;
activities have been supported by the UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the&#13;
UNDP/World Bank Sanitation Program, Danish International Development Agency&#13;
(DANIDA) and the Swiss Development Corporation. Although these donors' focus has&#13;
been rural, some of their work has extended to urban slum and peri-urban areas.&#13;
Most of the assistance in this sub-sector has financed the development and&#13;
installation of handpumps in rural areas and low-cost sanitation facilities&#13;
(i.e., latrines). UNICEF's program has been very successful in increasing water&#13;
supply coverage in rural areas. Continued assistance by UNICEF, however, is now&#13;
being limited due to funding constraints. Most UNICEF assistance expired in&#13;
FY95, with no funding allocated for FY96.  Total allocation for rural water&#13;
supply in the TYRIP was 12, which is clearly inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.9       Although DWASA and CWASA are supposed to be commercial and autonomous,&#13;
their capacity to generate financial resources to finance their own investments&#13;
has been limited. Donor resources for financing investments in the sector have&#13;
normally been supplemented by Government equity contributions and grants. For&#13;
operations and maintenance, tariff levels have generally been inadequate to fully&#13;
meet all operating costs and cover debt servicing costs. The resulting deficits&#13;
are usually financed by the Government indirectly by not servicing debt and&#13;
interest.&#13;
D. Sector Issues and Constraints&#13;
1.10      A number of issues hinder sector development and performance.  These&#13;
include problems related with inadequate funding of investments and poor resource&#13;
mobilization; the Government's management of the sector, lack of commercial&#13;
orientation in operations; and a weak planning capacity.&#13;

1.11      The availability of local funds to support investments in the sector&#13;
is generally inadequate. Government counterpart funds, even when budgeted for,&#13;
are not always made available when required, due to competing demands, thus&#13;
delaying project execution. Inadequate tariffs, poor revenue collection and a&#13;
high level of systems losses in the sector institutions (DWASA and CWASA) hamper&#13;
the mobilization of adequate internal resources to finance capital expenditures&#13;
for water and sanitation. In the municipalities, revenues are totally inadequate&#13;
to finance development and operating expenditures.   A 1986 analysis of 42&#13;
district towns shows that revenues on average covered only 29Z of current&#13;
expenditures. Foreign assistance through multilateral sources accounts for about&#13;
80Z of investments in the sector.&#13;
Sector Manazement&#13;
1.12      Overall sector management is characterized by Government control and&#13;
interference in the planning and operation of the water sector entities. While&#13;
DWASA and CWASA are supposed to be autonomous, most management decisions,&#13;
including tariff reviews and adjustments, staffing and investment decisions have&#13;
been controlled by the Government through MLGRDC. There are no clearly defined&#13;
guidelines for sectoral development or mandates for DWASA and CWASA's operations.&#13;
As a result, the WASAs have never had real commercial or management autonomy,&#13;
which has significantly hampered their performance. In addition, management and&#13;
staff of these sector institutions lack the necessary skills, experience and&#13;
training to effectively manage, operate and maintain the systems.&#13;
Lack of Commercial Orientation&#13;
1.13      DWASA and CWASA also suffer from a lack of commercial orientation and&#13;
accountability, poor management systems, and shortage of trained and motivated&#13;
staff. Poor billing and collection practices, a high level of unaccounted-for-&#13;
water, and high accounts receivable arrears are typical examples of this lack of&#13;
accountability. In a local zone serviced by DWASA, it was estimated that the&#13;
level of unaccounted for water was as high as 53% in FY93, thus reducing revenue&#13;
significantly and resulting in higher tariffs for the population paying the&#13;
bills. Of this, a large percentage (about 35%), is attributable to technical&#13;
losses while the remaining losses are classified as commercial or administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
losses, e.g. under-billing as a result of unmetered connections, illegal&#13;
connections, inaccurate and tampered meters and rent-seeking activities of the&#13;
meter inspectors.&#13;
Weak Plannina Cai,acitv&#13;
1.14      Development in the sector tends to be adversely affected by optimistic&#13;
and ambitious goals that do not take into account the physical and financial&#13;
capacity of the sector institutions to carry out investments programs. Sector&#13;
development activities are planned on a project by project basis, without a&#13;
guiding framework.   In addition, lack of a clear operation and maintenance&#13;
programs and funding makes planned investments unsustainable. As an example, in&#13;
DWASA and CWASA, planned maintenance is limited to pumping stations and does not&#13;
include regular checks on distribution system mains for leaks.&#13;
E. The Government's Sector Strategv&#13;
1.15      The Government recognizes the urgent need to improve water supply and&#13;
sanitation in Dhaka and other areas. The Government also acknowledges the poor&#13;
performance of the water supply utilities, and how this performance has affected&#13;
efficient provision of water and sanitation services. The Government's sector&#13;
objective is to improve health and human productivity through the development of&#13;
services that are affordable and sustainable to as many people as possible, while&#13;
improving the efficiency of the sector institutions. The Government's policy and&#13;
strategy for water supply and sanitation sector development as seen in the&#13;
context of the national development strategy outlined in the Fourth Five-Year&#13;
Plan emphasizes, among other things, a "gradual shift of public service delivery&#13;
agencies from being providers of service to facilitators", and to encourage the&#13;
mobilization of local resources. Such a shift implies a move by the Government&#13;
from public provision of services to that of setting policy, while increasing the&#13;
role of the private  sector  in providing  such  services.   Local  resource&#13;
mobilization is especially important because the Government's efforts to improve&#13;
water supply and sanitation services in Dhaka and other areas are constrained in&#13;
part, by a lack of adequate resources. In addition, investments in the sector&#13;
are usually lumpy, requiring significant financial resources to implement planned&#13;
capacity additions. IDA's 1989 Country Economic Memorandum (Bangladesh: Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, Public Resource Management during the Fourth Five-Year Plan,&#13;
(FFYP) FY91-95) identified major investments on the order of $350 million as&#13;
being necessary for the water supply sector during the FFYP period. Because of&#13;
resource constraints, the Government's medium terms strategy is to emphasize the&#13;
rehabilitation of existing systems, where possible together with improvements in&#13;
efficiency, operations and maintenance. This rehabilitation would need to be&#13;
followed with carefully planned expansion of selected new systems, to provide&#13;
acceptable service to the rapidly expanding population. Such programs would have&#13;
to be accompanied by institutional strengthening, institutional and policy&#13;
reforms to bring about efficiency in operations and improvements in service&#13;
levels at the least cost possible. The proposed project follows this strategy.&#13;
The proposed new investments represents less than 50% of the investments&#13;
identified for the FFYP, but with efficiency gains expected from policy and&#13;
institutional reforms, substantial benefits would be achieved in service&#13;
provision. The project follows from the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project, which&#13;
financed substantial rehabilitation of the existing distribution system.&#13;
&#13;

F. Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.16      IDA's lending to the water sector supply dates back to the 1950's.&#13;
A review of IDA's experience in lending to the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
was recently undertaken with the objective of ascertaining the impact of Bank&#13;
involvement and refining some of the lessons of the experience (Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Projects, The Bank's Experience - 1967-1989). The report highlighted&#13;
several areas where IDA assisted projects had failed to achieve stated&#13;
objectives.   The most persistent problems include inadequate pricing, high&#13;
unaccounted-for-water,  poor financial management and cost recovery.   Other&#13;
principal areas of concern include the lack of autonomy from the central&#13;
authority,  continuous  political  interference,  lack  of  continuity  of  top&#13;
management, and poor incentives. The lessons learned from this study were: (i)&#13;
institutional performance, particularly in the areas of operations and&#13;
maintenance, unaccounted-for-water and human resources management, has been good&#13;
only where there was autonomy in utility management and an arms-length regulatory&#13;
system; (ii) sector organizations have relied too much on Government involvement&#13;
and public finances; (iii) the environmental impact of water projects were not&#13;
well documented, and the environment may have suffered as a result of weaknesses&#13;
in sector institutions and key policies, like pricing; and (iv) project&#13;
components, and related financial and operational covenants, did not specifically&#13;
address broader policy or development objectives, thus contributing to poor&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
1.17      IDA's experience in South Asia, and in particular in Bangladesh,&#13;
reflects this experience. In Bangladesh, IDA has assisted the Government in the&#13;
water supply and sanitation sector since 1963, having financed five water supply&#13;
projects in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong. The First Dhaka Water Supply&#13;
Project (Credit 368-BD, 1973) was initially approved in 1963 as Credit 41-PAK for&#13;
US$26 million. This was later reduced to US$13 million, and financed groundwater&#13;
development involving tubewells and strengthening and extension of the existing&#13;
sewerage system. Implementation of this project was delayed due to the political&#13;
events that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. The Second Dhaka&#13;
Water Supply  Project (Credit 941-BD) approved in 1979 (US$20.5 million) helped&#13;
finance more tubewells, water distribution system improvements, elevated service&#13;
reservoirs, service connections, training and consulting services. The Third&#13;
Dhaka Water Supply Project (Credit 1734-BD), approved in 1986 (US$35 million) and&#13;
completed in March 1994, helped finance the upgrading and expansion of the water&#13;
supply and sanitation facilities in Dhaka and the surrounding areas.   In&#13;
Chittagong, the First Chittagong Water Supply Project (Credit 367-BD, 1973)&#13;
approved as Credit 42-PAK in 1963 provided US$20 million to finance groundwater&#13;
development, extension of the distribution system, metering and technical&#13;
assistance. The Second Chittagong Water Supply Project (Credit 1001-BD) of US$20&#13;
million financed the development of a surface water treatment plant and the&#13;
extension of the distribution system.&#13;
1.18      While physical objectives of these projects were basically met and the&#13;
water supply increased substantially, the financial and institutional objectives&#13;
were not fully met.  A review of the performance of the Third DWASA Project&#13;
provide a good example.   The project development objectives were to improve&#13;
DWASA's operational and financial performance, to strengthen sectoral training&#13;
and sectoral planning and to address immediate needs for additional supplies of&#13;
water and sanitation services.  Some of the specific objectives were to: (a)&#13;
continue the institutional development of DWASA emphasizing operational&#13;
efficiency, cost recovery and manpower development; (b) further develop Dhaka's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
groundwater resources in order to increase cost-effectively the supply of potable&#13;
water and expand distribution of water to areas where service is poor or non-&#13;
existent through additional connections; (c) strengthen DWASA's control of&#13;
leakage and unaccounted-for-water, and rehabilitate parts of DWASA's distribution&#13;
system; and (d) extend secondary sewer to areas in which conventional sewerage&#13;
is affordable to maximize the existing waterborne sewerage system. A review of&#13;
progress against original project components at project completion showed that&#13;
DWASA exceeded original physical targets, and increased water production by 42%&#13;
beyond the targets in the appraisal report, and provided water to an additional&#13;
100,000 people.&#13;
1.19      Financial and  institutional performance was,  however,  not  fully&#13;
satisfactory. Although DWASA's revenues during the project period were close to&#13;
appraisal estimates, DWASA was unable to meet financial covenants set under the&#13;
project. Several reasons explain this performance. First, the financial and&#13;
institutional objectives established in the project were not supported by actual&#13;
components to address identified problems or to provide monitorable indicators.&#13;
There were no specific components in the project to improve financial and&#13;
institutional performance, or to help DWASA meet financial covenants.   As a&#13;
result, DWASA did not have a clear perspective of why its performance was&#13;
considered unsatisfactory especially since actual results were in line with&#13;
projected performance.   Even if DWASA had fully met physical and financial&#13;
covenants, its institutional and operational performance would still be weak,&#13;
since issues like poor management performance, system losses and poor efficiency&#13;
were not particularly addressed under the project.   Secondly, DWASA's poor&#13;
performance was also caused by excessive control of the institution by GOB which&#13;
created obstacles  to good performance.   Lack of commitment  to financial&#13;
objectives resulted in GOB's refusal to authorize required tariff increases to&#13;
compensate for increases in operating costs.  In general, implementation was&#13;
delayed due to problems associated with political transition in the earlier&#13;
projects and procurement problems, primarily in the appointment of consultants.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
1.20      The implementation issues of the Third DWASA Project indicates clearly&#13;
that it is not sufficient to concentrate on financial and operational covenants,&#13;
financial results, and related tariff adjustments to bring about sustainable&#13;
changes in the institutions' operating practices.  A more sustainable reform&#13;
program must address the underlying institutional arrangements, or more&#13;
specifically the relationship between the Government and the operating authority.&#13;
A more sustained policy dialogue with the Government on the need for reforms&#13;
prior to project processing is also necessary to ensure Government commitment to&#13;
required reforms. In addition, project objectives need to be clearly reflected&#13;
in specific actions and programs in the project components, with monitorable&#13;
targets and output indicators.&#13;
1.21      In preparing the proposed project, this approach has been followed in&#13;
designing the reform program to enhance DWASA's efficiency.   The strategy&#13;
involves public enterprise reform and contracting out some services. At the same&#13;
time, the Government would develop a strategy for mobilizing finance and&#13;
increasing efficiency.  The scale of investment requirements means that this&#13;
strategy will require greater private sector participation, probably through a&#13;
concession. Under the public sector reform strategy, the institutional reform&#13;
program and its components address the broader sector objectives and draws on the&#13;
lessons learned as follows: (i) the comprehensive modification of the WASA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Ordinance and the establishment of a Policy Statement, aimed at reducing&#13;
Government interference in DWASA operations and increasing its autonomy; (ii) the&#13;
proposed leak detection and rehabilitation program, the Twinning Program, the&#13;
plan to contract out DWASA services and the Crash Meter Installation Program will&#13;
reduce unaccounted-for-water and improve operations and maintenance; (iii)&#13;
pricing issues are being addressed under a program to revise the tariff&#13;
structure, based on Tariff Study undertaken as part of project preparation; (iv)&#13;
environmental issues and the need for strategies in water resources management&#13;
that strike an adequate balance between competing uses of water are being&#13;
addressed under the Water Resources Management  Study   and the  strategic&#13;
sanitation program in the project; and (v) necessary studies would be carried out&#13;
for identification of the specific privatization alternatives, and identification&#13;
of changes needed in the legal/regulatory framework.&#13;
G. The Bank's Strategy and It's Role in the Sector&#13;
1.22      The Bank's objectives for lending to the water supply and sanitation&#13;
sector seeks to achieve four objectives.  First, the Bank seeks to assist the&#13;
government to achieve the least-cost solution to providing water supply and&#13;
sanitation services.   Second, the Bank seeks to foster institution building,&#13;
including the ability by the Government to plan and facilitate national or&#13;
regional programs by mobilizing adequate resources necessary for sector&#13;
development,  through  multilateral  and  private  sector  participation,  and&#13;
establishing a sound regulatory and pricing framework including adequate pricing.&#13;
Third, the Bank seeks to act as a catalyst for attracting increasing amounts of&#13;
investment finance.   Finally, the Bank seeks to ensure the availability of a&#13;
minimum supply of safe water and sanitation facilities to an increasing share of&#13;
the population, particularly lower income groups.&#13;
1.23      The Bank's  role  in the sector is to assist  the Government  in&#13;
implementing its sectoral program through the provision of much needed financial&#13;
resources and in gradually resolving the sectoral issues and constraints&#13;
mentioned above. The Bank's involvement in the sector has been instrumental in&#13;
helping the Government to develop and implement feasible and least cost water&#13;
supply and sanitation investments in urban areas in Bangladesh. More recently,&#13;
the Bank has been instrumental in helping the Government gradually develop&#13;
institutional and financial reforms and policies for the sector.   This is&#13;
consistent with the overall public sector reform strategy as defined in the FY96&#13;
country assistance strategy (CAS). The CAS emphasizes reduction of public sector&#13;
losses and increasing their efficiency as urgent priorities, particularly for&#13;
public enterprises, like DWASA. The proposed reforms under the project which&#13;
involve commercialization of DWASA through introduction of private sector&#13;
participation, leading to privatization arrangements during implementation, are&#13;
consistent with the CAS strategy for reforming state owned enterprises.  The&#13;
proposed program under this project is considered the first phase of sector&#13;
reform. It will be followed by a water supply and sanitation sector study that&#13;
will focus, inter alia, on overall sector reform, using Dhaka as a case study.&#13;
The sector work will cover needed changes in the legal and regulatory framework,&#13;
the roles of the public and private sectors in meeting investment needs and&#13;
achieving operational efficiency and will provide an action plan for facilitating&#13;
private sector entry. Provided that agreement is reached with the Government on&#13;
such an action plan, the Bank would expect to support sector restructuring&#13;
through future operations.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. Urban Area and Features of Water Supply System&#13;
Background&#13;
2.1       The City of Dhaka is the administrative, commercial and industrial&#13;
center of Bangladesh. Dhaka's population has grown rapidly in recent times, the&#13;
highest growth rate (12.5%) being achieved between 1971 and 1985.   It is&#13;
estimated that the metropolitan Dhaka's current population is about 8.0 million,&#13;
approximately 30% of the total urban population.   By the year 2000, it is&#13;
estimated that Dhaka will have a population of about 9.6 million.   It is&#13;
estimated that about 45% of Dhaka's population lives below the poverty threshold.&#13;
The greater Dhaka area includes the township of Narayanganj, located on the&#13;
southwest part of the city.&#13;
2.2       Dhaka and Chittagong are the major economic centers of Bangladesh, and&#13;
approximately two thirds of the current employment in these two cities is in the&#13;
informal  sector.    Dhaka's  economic  growth  depends  on  the  small  scale,&#13;
manufacturing industry, which accounted for 80Z of its GDP in 1993. The city's&#13;
strategy is to encourage the growth of processing and manufacturing, including&#13;
garment manufacturing, food processing and jute processing which together account&#13;
for one-third of the workforce. Manufacturing and the informal sector will be&#13;
critical to future labor absorption and provision of the bulk of the employment&#13;
to the urban poor in Dhaka, which has 36% share of the national large scale&#13;
manufacturing activity.&#13;
The Water Supply and Sewerage System&#13;
2.3       Up to 1989, the service area of DWASA was confined within   the&#13;
metropolitan area. At the beginning of 1990, the Narayanganj area was included&#13;
within the jurisdiction of DWASA. At present, the service area extends in the&#13;
north to Mirpur and Uttara, and to Narayanganj in the south. Water supply to the&#13;
greater Dhaka area has increased ten-folds since the 1960's.   However, the&#13;
quantity of water produced per capita has not increased much because of the rapid&#13;
population growth of the city.  Current water production is estimated at 768&#13;
million liters per day (mld) (166.0/IMGD). Out of this total, 729 mld (95%) is&#13;
produced from about 181 tubewells in Dhaka City and about 8 mld (1%) from 9&#13;
tubewells in the Narayanganj area. The Chandnigat Water Treatment Plant, located&#13;
in Dhaka produces about 16 mld (2%), while two treatment plants located in&#13;
Narayanganj produce 15 mld (2%).  In 1995 gross requirements for water were&#13;
estimated to be about 1,150 mld, and expected to grow to 2,482 mld by 2000. The&#13;
total forecasted demand and supply of water from DWASA is shown in Annex 1.1 and&#13;
summarized in Table 2.1 below. The forecast is based on the projected growth in&#13;
the population of Dhaka and increased water consumption. The supply outlook is&#13;
based on the implementation of the phases of DWASA's long-term investment&#13;
program. Even with the planned additions to DWASA's capacity, Dhaka is going to&#13;
continue to face water shortages during the investment program period (1996-&#13;
2020).&#13;

2.4       At present, DWASA has about 160,080 service connections, of which&#13;
110,177 are metered. The present water supply distribution system extends over&#13;
some 1,260 km with diameters ranging from 450 mm to 75 mm, and pipe materials&#13;
comprising asbestos cement, poly-vinl chloride (PVC) and mild steel of various&#13;
ages and quality. However most of the system is reported to be of steel, over&#13;
50 years old, corroded in many places and in need of repairs, in particular, the&#13;
secondary distribution system which consists of pipes made from materials that&#13;
have been phased out.   All operating deep tubewells are connected to this&#13;
distribution system, but supply is localized to the area in which the tubewell&#13;
is located. The pressure is generally low, ranging from 2 to 4 meters in the&#13;
south and central part of the city, with slightly higher pressures in some parts&#13;
of the city.   There are supply deficiencies throughout the city, prompting&#13;
complaints from consumers.   A total of 35 elevated storage reservoirs are&#13;
provided in the system, but because of the large demand for water and the low&#13;
pressure in the system, the water is pumped directly into the distribution&#13;
system, by-passing the elevated reservoirs.   The project will provide an&#13;
expansion of the distribution system network, expected to provide water to an&#13;
additional 500,000 people, as well as reducing suppressed demand over the whole&#13;
DWASA area.&#13;
2.5       Dhaka's sewerage system extends over 450 km, and consists of lateral&#13;
and trunk lines, interceptors and lift stations. Due to the flat terrain of the&#13;
city, sewage flows by gravity to lift stations, until it reaches the Pagla&#13;
Treatment facility, from which the treated effluent is discharged into the&#13;
Buriganga River. Currently there are about 40,790 sewer service connections,&#13;
covering only 29% of the population served by DWASA water supply. Waterborne&#13;
sewerage is expensive and the investments involved are beyond DWASA's resource&#13;
capability. With the increasing population, it will be necessary for DWASA to&#13;
pursue less costly on site sanitation alternatives, including rehabilitation of&#13;
the existing system to ensure that the majority of the population has access to&#13;
safer sanitation services.&#13;
B. Level of Water Service&#13;
2.6       At present, it is estimated that the population served by the DWASA&#13;
water service is 4.1 million, representing about 65Z of the total population of&#13;
DWASA's service area, and only 50Z of the population of the metropolitan Dhaka&#13;
area. Actual production is estimated at 166 IMGD, while total billed consumption&#13;
in FY95 was estimated to be 80.0 IMGD.   Of the total population served,&#13;
approximately 92%, equivalent to 3.6 million are supplied through house&#13;
connections while the remaining population (300,000) is supplied through 1,680&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
standposts located in high density areas throughout the city. Presently, the&#13;
population served through house connections is estimated on the basis of 24.4&#13;
people per connection, while the population per hydrant is estimated to be 175&#13;
people per hydrant.   This is considerably higher than other countries, but&#13;
reflects the crowded conditions of most housing areas in Dhaka, the tendency in&#13;
Dhaka to live in high rise apartments, and the high population growth rate. The&#13;
projections further assume that the average number of households per connection&#13;
is 2.4.&#13;
2.7       About 7%-12Z of DWASA's customers in Dhaka (excluding Narayanganj) are&#13;
classified as commercial and industrial. Commercial customers include hotels,&#13;
office building and restaurants, while manufacturing and processing industries,&#13;
e.g.,  tanneries are classified as industrial.   Most  industrial and large&#13;
commercial concerns have a private supply, usually obtained by installing a deep&#13;
tubewell. This explains the lov level of industrial and commercial consumption&#13;
from DWASA's supply. Until recently, such private tubewells were unregulated,&#13;
leading to excessive groundwater abstraction and wasteful water use practices and&#13;
threatening the availability and sustainability of groundwater as a long-term&#13;
resource.    Recently,  the  Government  introduced  legislation  to  regulate&#13;
groundwater use, by requiring all private tubewells to be formally registered&#13;
with DWASA and users to pay an initial and annual license fee. Although this&#13;
legislation is in place, enforcement is very weak, and most tubewells still&#13;
operate unregulated. A review of the regulatory framework for the water resource&#13;
use will be conducted under the Water Resources Management Study in the project&#13;
to address in the management of water resources, including the effective control&#13;
of private and industrial use (para. 3.7(d)(ii)).&#13;
C. Level of Sanitation Service&#13;
2.8       At present, Dhaka does not have an adequate sewerage and sanitation&#13;
system. The waterborne sewerage system operated by DWASA only covers about 15%&#13;
of the total population of Dhaka (or 29% of the population in DWASA service&#13;
area). It is estimated that another 30% of the population uses approximately&#13;
50,000 septic tanks and another 15% have access to bucket and pit latrines. The&#13;
remaining population do not have any form of acceptable sanitary disposal system.&#13;
Much of the sewage collection system is in poor condition due to lack of a proper&#13;
repair and maintenance program, which leads to sewage overflow into storm drains&#13;
during the rainy season.   This results in insanitary conditions, which are&#13;
aggravated by the lack of a well functioning sullage drainage system. Under an&#13;
ADB financed project, DWASA is installing a "small bore sewerage system" in&#13;
Mirpur. Other programs include a recently completed rehabilitation of the Pagla&#13;
Treatment Plant, financed by JICA, and a sanitation component under IDA's Urban&#13;
Development Project (Credit 1930-BD) involving the construction of latrines in&#13;
slum areas. The proposed project includes a technical assistance component for&#13;
the preparation of a comprehensive long-term program to address sanitation and&#13;
sewerage issues in Dhaka, including the execution of priority investments for low&#13;
cost sanitation and sewerage system rehabilitation. (para. 3.7(c)(iii).&#13;
D. DWASA's Investment Program&#13;
2.9       In order to meet future water demand, four alternative programs were&#13;
considered under the long term investment program for water supply and&#13;
sanitation. These alternative programs are combinations of expansion phases of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
surface water treatment plants at two sites (Saidabad, from the Lakhya River and&#13;
Friendship Bridge, from the Buriganga River) and the development of additional&#13;
tubewells conjuntively to supplement surface water sources.  However, in the&#13;
short run the Friendship bridge alternatives were shown to present problems due&#13;
to possible pollution at the identified site, and land acquisition difficulties.&#13;
The alternatives were thus reduced to different phases of the Saidabad plant.&#13;
For future groundwater development, the basic decision of investments must be&#13;
based on an in-depth analysis of the technical aspects of groundwater resource&#13;
availability, and a well-defined and enforceable plan to regulate private and&#13;
public production from groundwater.&#13;
2.10 _   Annex 1.2 shows the various components of the long-term investment&#13;
program. This program represents the priority investments needed to reduce water&#13;
shortages and meet future demand from 1996 to the year 2020. The basis of the&#13;
investment program is a least cost combination of deep tubewells and surface&#13;
water treatment plant.   Included in the program are activities to expand&#13;
sewerage, costing about US$1.2 billion. Clearly, these would be reviewed and&#13;
evaluated in the context of available financial resources. However, sanitary&#13;
conditions in Dhaka are poor and deteriorating (current coverage is about 15%),&#13;
and investments in sewerage expansion are critically needed.  The sanitation&#13;
component under the project will redefine the sewerage investment program to&#13;
identify less costly options for sanitation in Dhaka, including investments in&#13;
low cost sanitation to be undertaken in the medium term.&#13;
2.11      The total long-term investment program for water up to 2020 is US$588&#13;
million, which involves capacity additions from surface water of 50 IMGD in 1999&#13;
and 2008, and 100 IMGD in 2016, and deep tubewell field construction in 2002/03.&#13;
However, the development of deep tubewell capacity will have to be based on an&#13;
assessment of groundwater sources and a plan for adequate management of the&#13;
aquifer based on the results of the Water Resources Management Study in this&#13;
project. IDA's involvement in the program is a time slice of US$175.8 million&#13;
(30%) in the first phase, whose objective is to reduce supply deficits, and&#13;
improve the distribution network to reduce losses.&#13;
2.12      The program would allow for modest increases in water supply and&#13;
sanitation coverage.  Much larger investments would be required if adequate&#13;
coverage (over 90% for water and 60% for sanitation) is to be provided for Dhaka.&#13;
Such investment requirements are beyond the financing capability of the&#13;
Government and donors.  Under this project, a study to assess private sector&#13;
participation in DWASA would also explore private financing for the accelerated&#13;
investment program.&#13;
E. Groundwater Vs Surface Water Options&#13;
2.13      DWASA's earlier projects financed by the Government and IDA developed&#13;
water supply primarily from groundwater sources. However, the need for a surface&#13;
water treatment plant to increase the water supply in Dhaka has been recognized&#13;
for some time due to the considerable lowering of the groundwater table in Dhaka.&#13;
Studies undertaken during the preparation of the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project&#13;
(Cr. 1734-BD) recommended the construction of a surface water treatment plant as&#13;
the next major investment for water supply for Dhaka (Report No. 5964-BD). Under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Credit 1734-BD, a Dhaka Region Groundwater and Subsidence Studyl was undertaken&#13;
with the objective of assessing the impact of construction of additional&#13;
tubewells within the Dhaka area to the current groundwater levels.  Specific&#13;
objectives were to: (a) assess the impact of increased groundwater abstraction&#13;
in the greater Dhaka area; (b) quantify future groundwater abstraction, wellfield&#13;
location and management of groundwater resources; and (c) evaluate the effect of&#13;
increased abstraction on the compaction of clay and silt layers overlying the&#13;
main aquifer.&#13;
2.14      The findings of this study showed that groundwater levels beneath&#13;
Dhaka City have fallen steadily over the last 25 years in response to continually&#13;
increasing abstraction. Water levels have dropped in the Motijheel, Tejgaon and&#13;
Old Dhaka areas and reached a maximum depth of 20 meters below ground surface&#13;
levels in 1989 (from about 3 meters in 1965). The groundwater resource model&#13;
developed under this study also showed that if no new wells are commissioned in&#13;
Dhaka City and the existing wells continue to operate at their present&#13;
discharges, a steady state would be achieved by 1992/93 without reducing the&#13;
capacity of the existing DWASA tubewells, although there would be reduction in&#13;
yields in private wells whose pumps were set at depths of less than 20 meters.&#13;
If additional wells were commissioned, the groundwater level would continue to&#13;
fall, thus affecting the yield of existing DWASA wells.  The study however noted&#13;
that abstraction in Dhaka City did not affect groundwater levels in wellfields&#13;
outside Dhaka City (North and West of Dhaka, Savar, Tongi and Keraninganj).&#13;
2.15      Based on this analysis, the study recommended that subject to further&#13;
investigations, there should be limited development of groundwater between Dhaka&#13;
City and Narayanganj because of limited recharge potential, and the risk of&#13;
increased drawdown in the groundwater. While the study recommended development&#13;
of groundwater in the areas outside the city, it also noted that this may cause&#13;
some adverse effects to irrigation and industrial users who are located in these&#13;
areas. The study also noted that the cost of bringing water from outside Dhaka&#13;
into the city could be high (transmission pipes, land acquisition, river&#13;
crossings); thus, it recommended that well fields outside the city should be&#13;
developed for localized supply instead of supplying the city.&#13;
2.16      The economic costs of bringing water from these areas for Dhaka City&#13;
were analyzed during the preparation of this project. Based on this analysis,&#13;
it was concluded that the most effective option in the short-run would be the&#13;
development of surface water to supply water to Dhaka City, coupled with the&#13;
development of wellfields outside Dhaka in the medium term, to meet needs as the&#13;
city expands closer to those areas.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Origin&#13;
3.1       In the past three decades, the Government of Bangladesh has sought to&#13;
formulate a long-term water master plan for the city of Dhaka, using the least&#13;
cost method and utilizing available water resources to alleviate water shortages&#13;
in the city.  A feasibility study and the master plan, financed by bilateral&#13;
donor assistance was prepared in 1992. Project preparation since the completion&#13;
of the study emphasized on reaching agreement in principle with the Government&#13;
of Bangladesh on the institutional and financial reforms required to enable DWASA&#13;
to operate with more autonomy and efficiency  as a truly independent commercial&#13;
utility capable of generating adequate revenues to cover all its operating and&#13;
maintenance costs, and servicing its debt. Agreement in principle on the reform&#13;
program was a condition to further preparation of the physical components of the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.2       The project represents the least cost feasible solution for the&#13;
provision of 50 IMGD to meet demand projections.   As discussed above, the&#13;
development of an equivalent 50 IMGD well field source at Keraninganj, on the&#13;
right bank of the Buriganga River (including transmission, and access roads) to&#13;
supply Dhaka City is estimated to exceed the cost of the Saidabad surface water&#13;
treatment plant and transmission, not counting the cost of well replacements&#13;
which would be necessary over the life of the project.  Deep tubewells will&#13;
require to be redrilled every 10-15 years just to maintain output.&#13;
3.3       Difficulties with the well-field solution include the acquisition of&#13;
agricultural land, access and technical problems with the river crossing. The&#13;
development of surface supplies will also help arrest the continuing decline in&#13;
the water table which is resulting in higher pumping costs in the most depleted&#13;
areas of the well field. This draw-down eventually leads to the suspension of&#13;
production altogether. DWASA on average, is currently replacing seven tube-wells&#13;
every year.   The project is justified on economic, financial and technical&#13;
grounds as the next step for DWASA in the provision of safe drinking water in&#13;
Dhaka.&#13;
B. Proiect Obiectives&#13;
3.4       The basic objectives of the project are: (i) to commence a program of&#13;
institutional reforms that would lead to efficient operation of the water and&#13;
sanitation sector in Dhaka on a commercial basis and prepare a strategy to&#13;
enhance private operations and mobilize private finance; (ii) to increase the&#13;
life of existing assets and reduce water losses through a water loss reduction&#13;
and rehabilitation program; (iii) strengthen water resources management for the&#13;
greater Dhaka area, by optimizing use of available water resources in the most&#13;
economic and environmentally acceptable way; and (iv) to increase potable water&#13;
supply in the Dhaka area by effectively utilizing available surface and&#13;
groundwater resources to expand water supply in the Dhaka metropolitan area.&#13;
3.5       The focus of the project is on:  (a) institutional strengthening and&#13;
achievement of financial and operational autonomy to ensure that DWASA, within&#13;
a reasonable time frame, is able to provide efficient and reliable services; and&#13;
(b) increasing available water supply to alleviate shortages through loss&#13;
reduction and capacity additions. The institutional components of the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
will address some of the key sectoral constraints identified, namely the lack of&#13;
commercial orientation in DWASA operations, weak planning capacity and excessive&#13;
control by GOB on DWASA's day-to-day operations. This effort is consistent with&#13;
the country objectives for public enterprise/utility reforms.    The physical&#13;
components will improve DWASA's capacity to provide water supply and sanitation&#13;
services more efficiently and expand its service to new areas.   Technical&#13;
assistance will support better operations under a private   sector manager&#13;
supported with a twinning arrangement, and including a study leading to a higher&#13;
degree of private sector participation and mobilization of private finance.&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.6       IDA has supported GOB and DWASA develop and improve the urban water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector for many years. While much has been accomplished&#13;
on the physical side, the increase in water produced per capita has been marginal&#13;
due to the high population growth of Dhaka and other urban areas.   Further&#13;
investments are required to rehabilitate the system, reduce losses and increase&#13;
supply.   Institutional performance has been unsatisfactory, while financial&#13;
performance has been erratic. The objectives being pursued in this project are&#13;
part of the broad fundamental reforms IDA is pursuing in the country's public&#13;
utility sector including power and gas as well as water. This approach is built&#13;
on the recognition that the investments needed in these sectors to support growth&#13;
and public welfare exceed the fiscal prospects of the public sector; it also&#13;
recognizes that successive governments have not been able to produce efficient,&#13;
financially self-sustaining public utilities. It looks to maximizing the role&#13;
of the private sector, under a sound, transparent and independently administered&#13;
regulatory framework. Furthermore, as the lead donor in Bangladesh, IDA can play&#13;
a major catalytic role by giving the Government's institutional reform program&#13;
the support it needs, by encouraging the Government to continue with the reform&#13;
process and sustain its momentum and by assisting in coordinating donor&#13;
participation within the reform framework. IDA's involvement will also assist&#13;
in the orderly and efficient development of the sector by helping DWASA better&#13;
define and rationalize its investment options, GOB to plan and analyze such&#13;
investments to increase availability of water and sanitation services, promote&#13;
private sector participation and better water resource management, and finally&#13;
help define a sanitation strategy for Dhaka. The Bank's involvement will also&#13;
afford DWASA opportunities to draw on the Bank Group's experience in utility&#13;
reform in other countries.&#13;

E. Proiect Cost Estimates&#13;
3.8               The total project costs,  including contingencies  is estimated at&#13;
US$175.8 million equivalent (Taka 7.4 billion), of which US$88.1 million (50.1Z)&#13;
is in foreign exchange. The project cost includes taxes and duties estimated at&#13;
about US$35.5 million. The base cost is expressed in January 1996 prices. Cost&#13;
estimates for the project are based on consultant feasibility studies and&#13;
preliminary design, and the cost of recently awarded contracts for similar works,&#13;
updated to January 1996 price levels after appraisal.&#13;
3.9               Physical contingencies are estimated at 5 to 10% for all the civil&#13;
works, equipment and consultancy services. Estimated price increases over the&#13;
project period amounted to 5% of the base costs plus physical contingencies.&#13;
Price escalations for foreign costs are estimated at 4.5% for FY95, 2.9% for&#13;
FY96, 2.0% for FY97, 2.1% for FY98, 2.3% for FY99, 2.4% FY00, 2.3% for FY01, and&#13;
2.2% thereafter, and for local costs at 4.0% for FY95, 5.0% for FY96, and 4.0%&#13;
for FY97 and thereafter. It is estimated that the exchange rate adjustment would&#13;
on average, maintain purchasing power parity during the project implementation&#13;
period. Summary project cost estimates are shown in Table 3.1 and detailed cost&#13;
estimates are given in Annexes 6.1 and 6.2.&#13;

3.10     The project cost estimates are based on a five year implementation&#13;
period.  This is shorter than the regional disbursement profile of seven years&#13;
for similar projects, but attainable because of the turnkey arrangement of the&#13;
main contract, the treatment plant.&#13;
F. The Proiect Financing Plan&#13;
3.11     The project financing plan includes the proceeds of the credit, co-&#13;
financing from the Government of France and the Government of Japan, and&#13;
counterpart financing from the Government of Bangladesh. The proposed IDA credit&#13;
of US$80.3 million would finance 45.7% of the total project cost (excluding&#13;
taxes). The Government of France would finance US$31.3 million, equivalent to&#13;
17.8% of the total financing requirements. The Government of Japan would finance&#13;
about US$1.3 million of the project which would be administered by IDA.  The&#13;
remaining funds (US$62.9 million) will be provided by the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh and DWASA. The financing plan for the project is summarized in Table&#13;
3.2 below.&#13;

3.12     The proposed IDA credit would finance 63.5% of the project's foreign&#13;
costs while the French Government would finance 35.6%, and the Government of&#13;
Japan would finance the remaining 0.9%.  The IDA credit would finance intake&#13;
works and the pump station at Sarulia on the Lakhya River, the culvert from the&#13;
DND Canal to the treatment plant site and ancillary structures, civil works for&#13;
treatment plant, primary transmission and secondary distribution mains, system&#13;
rehabilitation institutional strengthening and all technical assistance with the&#13;
exception of the Water Resource Management Study. The French co-financing would&#13;
finance the foreign exchange costs of the equipment supply and installation of&#13;
the treatment plant. The Government of Japan financing will cover the consulting&#13;
services for the Water Resources Management Study. The Government counterpart&#13;
resources would finance customs duties and taxes, land acquisition, while DWASA&#13;
would finance the rehabilitation of the DND Canal and development of the Saidabad&#13;
Treatment Plant site.&#13;
3.13     The IDA credit would be made to the Government of Bangladesh on&#13;
standard IDA terms for a duration of 40 years including 10 years of grace. The&#13;
credit would be onlent to DWASA under a subsidiary loan agreement, and will be&#13;
repaid over twenty-five years, including five years of grace, at an interest rate&#13;
of 7.5%. The French Government financing will be on-lent to DWASA at the same&#13;
terms. Like past DWASA projects, the foreign exchange risk on the IDA credit&#13;
would be borne by the Government of Bangladesh. The execution of a Subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement between DWASA and GOB and the French Government and the Japanese&#13;
Government Agreements would be conditions of credit effectiveness.&#13;

IV. PROJECT EXECUTION&#13;
A. Status of Preparation&#13;
4.1       Project preparation is significantly in advanced stage. Land has been&#13;
acquired for the treatment plant and the designs of the civil works for treatment&#13;
plant and ancillary works are in progress.   The contract for the supply of&#13;
equipment for treatment plant has been awarded. Detailed designs, bid documents,&#13;
and prequalification documents have been finalized for the Lakhya Pumping Station&#13;
and the intakes, primary and secondary distribution mains, and the culvert from&#13;
the DND canal to the treatment plant site, and have been reviewed by IDA and the&#13;
prequalification  of  contractors  for  these  works  is  in  progress.    The&#13;
rehabilitation of the DND canal and development of the treatment plant site being&#13;
financed by DWASA and GOB have been awarded and works are about to be completed.&#13;
4.2       Regarding  technical  assistance  and  institutional  strengthening,&#13;
contracts for the Management Operational Support (Twining) Program and the&#13;
Strategic Sanitation Program are ready to be awarded. Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
(TOR), letters of invitation (LOI) and shortlists have been prepared for the&#13;
Water Resources Management Study and construction supervision of the treatment&#13;
plant, and consultants are about to be appointed.  Bidding documents for the&#13;
program to contract out billing and collections are being finalized for IDA's&#13;
review and tenders will be invited shortly.   The first phase of the Leak&#13;
Detection and Rehabilitation Program and the Crash Meter Installation Program is&#13;
in progress. TOR and LOI for all other technical assistance have been prepared.&#13;
The Project Concept Paper (PCP) for the proposed project has been approved by&#13;
GOB.&#13;
B. Prolect Implementation&#13;
4.3       The project will be implemented by DWASA, which will be accountable&#13;
and responsible for meeting agreed project and operating objectives. With the&#13;
completion of the Third DWASA Project in March 1994, and experience in&#13;
implementation of ADB and Japanese funded projects, DWASA has demonstrated its&#13;
ability to satisfactorily implement medium sized civil works projects.  It is&#13;
estimated that the project will be implemented over a period of five years, which&#13;
is less than the average implementation period for similar projects in&#13;
Bangladesh. This is due to the turnkey arrangements for the installation of the&#13;
treatment plant equipment. To speed implementation after project approval, GOB&#13;
and DWASA have already completed work on the improvement of the DND Canal, to&#13;
introduce canal overflow structures for maintaining the canal operation level at&#13;
5 meters above current levels and the back fill of the Saidabad treatment plant&#13;
site.&#13;
4.4       Project implementation will give priority to the construction of the&#13;
surface water treatment plant, Phase 1 of the Leak Detection and Rehabilitation&#13;
Program, the Crash Meter Installation Program, and the management consultancy&#13;
services for the improvement of the operations and management of DWASA.  The&#13;
signing of the contracts for the Sanitation Program and the management operation&#13;
support (twinning) program would be conditions of credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
4.5       Details of land acquisition for the project are shown at Annex 9.1.&#13;
Land for the treatment plant is already owned by DWASA and a provision has been&#13;
included in the project cost for its value. Land acquisition necessary for the&#13;
conveyance route from the Sitalakhya River to the treatment plant site amounts&#13;
to a total of 6.1 acres. This includes 0.91 acres at the pump-house site, 1.55&#13;
acres for the right-of-way (ROW) for the culvert to the DND Canal, and 3.64 acres&#13;
for the ROW for the culvert from the DND Canal to the Saidabad treatment plant&#13;
site. A total of 37 small plots are involved. Five plots contain temporary sheds&#13;
and other temporary buildings that will be removed prior to construction.&#13;
Compensation has already been paid for the loss of property. A cadastral map is&#13;
available that details the canal routing in relation to the plots concerned. The&#13;
acquisition involved some involuntary resettlement. In view of the small number&#13;
of buildings to be removed, no full resettlement action plan was required. DWASA&#13;
followed IDA's resettlement guidelines in compensation for all project affected&#13;
people and appointed a local consultant to assist in providing compensation and&#13;
support to resettlers and monitor progress of payments by the District&#13;
Administrator.&#13;
4.6       The process of land acquisition is carried out by the Ministry of&#13;
Establishment at the direction of the Ministry of Land, following DWASA's&#13;
request. During negotiations, GOB confirmed that the acquisition of the 6.1&#13;
acres was completed and DWASA had possession of the land. Payment of Tk. 21.6&#13;
million was made to the District Administrator (DA) which included compensation&#13;
for loss of land and property on the site. GOB also confirmed that payment of&#13;
compensation to affected people would be completed a minimum of three months&#13;
prior to handing over of land to the contractors.&#13;
4.7       Access to the Saidabad treatment plant site is via a public road&#13;
through Jatrabari Point. The contractors for the site development component of&#13;
the project have constructed the access road from the existing all weather road&#13;
to the western side of the Saidabad site.&#13;
4.8       Along the DND Canal, rehabilitation of the embankment involved the&#13;
removal of a number of trees and temporary shacks where retail trading activities&#13;
take place. The contractor responsible for the rehabilitation facilitated the&#13;
removal of these sheds as part of the canal rehabilitation process. DWASA agreed&#13;
to pay a lump sum cash compensation to these shack owners for temporary loss of&#13;
income, and to cover relocation costs, in accordance with IDA resettlement&#13;
requirements.  A sturdy fence has been constructed on both sides of the DND&#13;
canal, as part of the contract to rehabilitate the canal. This fence is designed&#13;
to prevent access to the canal itself and thereby avoid pollution. Handpumps for&#13;
water supply, latrines, and several bridges will be provided along the DND Canal&#13;
in order to provide squatters who use the canal with alternative facilities. No&#13;
land acquisition is necessary as part of the DND Canal rehabilitation or as a&#13;
result of DWASA's use of the canal because the land and the canal belong to the&#13;
Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). As part of the agreement between&#13;
DWASA and BWDB, the land will remain in the ownership of BWDB, although operation&#13;
and maintenance of the canal along the conveyance route will be the&#13;
responsibility of DWASA.   DWASA is required to continue to supply existing&#13;
irrigators, and extra pumps are planned for the pump station in order to carry&#13;
this out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.9       As part of the resettlement process, DWASA prepared a plan for impact&#13;
mitigation along the route of conveyance.   This plan included a map of the&#13;
location of the temporary shops to be removed, together with consultation with&#13;
the local people regarding the location of new handpumps, latrines and bridges,&#13;
and compensation to cover relocation costs and temporary loss of income to be&#13;
paid to the shack owners. Details of these plan were reviewed during appraisal&#13;
and were found to be satisfactory.&#13;
C. Proiect Management&#13;
4.10      The project will be managed by the Planning and Development Department&#13;
(PDD) of DWASA. The PDD will execute the project, and supervise and monitor all&#13;
contracts and maintain all the records including the original copies of all&#13;
contracts and purchasing documents.   A Project Director has already been&#13;
appointed from DWASA, who will have overall- responsibility for the project,&#13;
including the co-ordination of construction of IDA and French financed&#13;
components. In addition, the Project Director will also have responsibility for&#13;
the implementation of the technical assistance for the project.&#13;
4.11      To assist the Project Director in the management of the project,&#13;
construction supervision consultants will be appointed. The first will be for&#13;
the supervision of the construction of the Surface Water Treatment Plant,&#13;
including intakes and the culvert, for about forty eight months. The other will&#13;
be for the construction of the primary and secondary distribution system,&#13;
expansion of service connections and rehabilitation of the distribution system.&#13;
These consultants will report to the Project Director and will coordinate the&#13;
overall implementation including verification of compliance with specifications&#13;
for goods and works, commissioning of completed works, advice on training of&#13;
staff to operate the completed facilities and preparation of necessary documents&#13;
for the procurement of all equipment, and civil works.&#13;
D. Prolect Supervision&#13;
4.12      Project  supervision by IDA and  the French Government would  be&#13;
coordinated and agreed at the Project Launch Workshop, to be undertaken at the&#13;
beginning of project implementation.   IDA supervision of the project would&#13;
require about 95 staff weeks, of which about 20 would be needed in the first year&#13;
for review of project start-up, procurement, bid specifications, and consultancy&#13;
appointments. This will likely involve three supervision missions in the first&#13;
year, and two in the later years. Supervision would be coordinated with IDA's&#13;
resident mission staff in Bangladesh. Supervision during project implementation&#13;
would be provided by sanitary engineering and financial staff, and would focus&#13;
on financial management, construction administration review, procurement actions,&#13;
etc. However, in the first year, additional special expertise would be required&#13;
in areas like leak detection, management of utilities and operational&#13;
improvements and institutional restructuring.   A mid-term review would be&#13;
undertaken mid-way through project implementation, but no later than December 31,&#13;
1998 to assess project management, implementation status, including progress in&#13;
institutional reform including increased private sector participation, progress&#13;
against agreed performance indicators and to recommend proposals for any changes&#13;
in the project scope, costs, timetables and agree on any necessary corrective&#13;
actions. A tentative staffing and timing schedule of supervision missions is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
given in Annex 9.5. Benchmarks for assessing progress at the mid-term review are&#13;
set out in Annex 9.6.&#13;
E. Proiect Reporting&#13;
4.13      Progress reports,  prepared by the PDD and provided monthly will&#13;
describe the work done on each of the components of the project to date,&#13;
detailing actual and anticipated progress, actual and estimated costs for the&#13;
work completed and disbursement from the credit with estimates in the Appraisal&#13;
Report.   The reports will highlight causes for delays, if any, and propose&#13;
measures to overcome them, and will anticipate any changes in the project&#13;
completion date, or the project costs. Details will be given of contract for&#13;
works, goods and services that have been awarded, invited or received during the&#13;
reporting period, with reasons for any changes made in the estimated&#13;
implementation schedule, quantities and costs.   Two copies of the progress&#13;
reports will be sent to IDA and the French Trade Commission in Dhaka within three&#13;
weeks of each reporting period.   Separate project reports on institutional&#13;
development components and consultant activities will also be provided as&#13;
specified in the TOR of these components. The format for these progress reports,&#13;
including pertinent information to be included in the reports, was agreed at&#13;
negotiations.   Within six months of completion of the project or the closing of&#13;
the credit, DWASA will prepare its part of the Implementation Completion Report,&#13;
with the assistance of the PDD.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
4.14      Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3.3&#13;

4.15      Civil Works:   The project includes about US$79.0 million in civil&#13;
works. About US$68.2 million of these works would be carried out on the basis of&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB).  This represents civil works for the&#13;
treatment plant, transmission mains, intake and culvert from the DND Canal to the&#13;
treatment plant site. Procurement for the primary and secondary distribution&#13;
network will be undertaken through a "Supply and Lay" type of contract to avoid&#13;
delays and problems associated with procuring pipes separately. For all civil&#13;
works contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, local&#13;
contractors will be eligible for a margin of preference of 7h%. Civil works&#13;
totalling US$7.8 million would be procured under national competitive bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures acceptable and satisfactory to IDA. These works relate to the&#13;
expansion of service connections, development of sewerage and sanitation schemes&#13;
and distribution system rehabilitation. These works represent small contracts&#13;
spread through the life of the project, and are unlikely to attract international&#13;
bidders.   GOB has already awarded the contracts for the development of the&#13;
treatment plant site and DND canal rehabilitation for an amount of US$3.0 million&#13;
under its own procedures and its own financing arrangements. A contract has&#13;
already been awarded for the supply of the electrical and mechanical equipment&#13;
for the water treatment and the civil works final design is now progress. The&#13;
civil works bidding documents, prepared in accordance with ICB procedures, will&#13;
be submitted for Bank review prior to bidding.&#13;
4.16      Goods:  There is a total of about US$57.1 million of equipment and&#13;
materials in the project, of which US$3.1 million will be procured following ICB&#13;
procedures.  These represent equipment and materials for the intake and pump&#13;
station, and miscellaneous equipment, including meters for service connection&#13;
expansion. For this procurement, local bidders will have a domestic preference&#13;
limited to the lesser amount of 15Z of the CIF price or the actual amount of&#13;
customs duties and import taxes. About US$0.2 million of the equipment will be&#13;
procured using NCB guidelines. Other equipment and materials would be financed&#13;
under the French Grant assistance.&#13;
4.17      Consultant and Contract Services: Consultancy studies and engineering&#13;
designs for about US$15.3 million will be carried out by consultants whose&#13;
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions shall be satisfactory to the&#13;
Association. These will be selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines,&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency.&#13;
4.18      Land Acquisition:  Land estimated to cost US$24.5 million, including&#13;
the land for the treatment plant already in possession of DWASA, and right-of-way&#13;
(ROW) for other works was procured using Government procedures.&#13;
4.19      All civil works contracts in excess of US$300,000, all goods package&#13;
contracts in excess of US$200,000 and all consulting firm contracts in excess of&#13;
US$100,000 (US$50,000 for individual consultants) will be subject to prior&#13;
review. With respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of value, prior&#13;
review will continue to be required for: (a) terms of reference; (b) single&#13;
source contracts regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts and&#13;
assignments of a critical nature (for example because of environmental safety or&#13;
public health considerations) regardless of value; and (d) contract amendments&#13;
valued at more than US$100,000 (US$50,000 for individual consultants) equivalent,&#13;
or those that raise the total contract value above US$100,000 (US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants) equivalent.   All procurement will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1996) and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Bank's latest Standard Bidding Documents for Works, Goods and Consulting&#13;
Services. At least 10Z of all other contracts will be subject to ex-post review.&#13;
However, to ensure that adequate procurement procedures are being followed, the&#13;
first two contracts under NCB for works, irrespective of the amount, will be&#13;
subject to IDA's review.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.20      Disbursements of the IDA credit proceeds will be on the following&#13;
basis:&#13;
(a) 100 percent (CIF) of total foreign expenditures and 95Z for local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory) on civil works for the treatment plant,&#13;
culvert, intake, ancillary works, sanitation program;&#13;
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures ex-factory, 100 percent for local&#13;
expenditures, and 65Z for other local expenditures procured locally&#13;
for all materials, equipment, miscellaneous equipment and machinery,&#13;
motor vehicles, water meters and training equipment;&#13;
(c) 100 percent of total expenditure for consultancy, advisory and&#13;
technical assistance services; and&#13;
(d) 100 percent of total expenditures for training costs.&#13;
4.21      In order to facilitate timely provision of funds for the project, the&#13;
Government would establish a Special Account in the amount of US$3.0 million with&#13;
Bangladesh Bank, for eligible expenditures under the project.  Disbursements&#13;
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs) for contracts for&#13;
works less than US$300,000, goods less than US$200,000, consulting firms less&#13;
than US$100,000 (or US$50,000 for individual consultants) and training less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent.  For all other contracts above these limits, including&#13;
single source (individual consultants), disbursements would be made on the basis&#13;
of standard documents. Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained in the&#13;
PIU, and made available for review by IDA upon request.&#13;
H. Retroactive Financing&#13;
4.22      To  expedite  implementation  of  the  project,  the  Government  has&#13;
requested that advance procurement, contracting and retroactive financing be&#13;
permitted for some of the contracts. The estimated value of this retroactive&#13;
financing is US$2.0 million.   This would finance part E of the project,&#13;
consisting of: (a) Part I of the Leak Detection Program (para. 5.10) for the&#13;
procurement of equipment, materials and initial consulting services for leak&#13;
detection activities to commence; (b) the first phase of the Crash Meter&#13;
Installation Program, to be used for contractual services for meter installation&#13;
(para. 5.8(b)); (c) preparation of designs and bid documents for ancillary works;&#13;
and d) procurement of equipment and other services to support the program to&#13;
contract out DWASA's  services  (para.  5.8  (a)).   Advance  contracting  and&#13;
retroactive financing will be subject to the condition that the components are&#13;
eligible for IDA financing at the time of procurement and that the Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines should have been followed. Expenditures incurred during&#13;
the year after December 1995 up to the signing date will be eligible for&#13;
retroactive financing.&#13;

V. IMPLEMENTING AGENCY&#13;
A. Implementing Organization&#13;
5.1       DWASA was established under the East Pakistan Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Authority Ordinance of 1963, as an autonomous body to provide adequate&#13;
and safe drinking water and sewerage facilities in the city of Dhaka.  DWASA&#13;
operates under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and&#13;
Cooperatives (MLGRDC). Its functions are to construct, improve and operate water&#13;
supply and sewerage works, and other facilities to improve environmental&#13;
sanitation in the city. The Ordinance spelt out the extent of Government control&#13;
over the day-to day operations of DWASA by requiring that DWASA be guided on&#13;
matters of policy by such directions as the Government may, from time to time&#13;
give.  In addition to water supply and sewerage, DWASA was in 1989 given the&#13;
responsibility of operating Dhaka's stormwater drainage system. DWASA's service&#13;
area, which includes the city of Narayanganj, has been divided into seven&#13;
geographical areas for purposes of operation and maintenance.&#13;
B. Organization Structure and Management&#13;
5.2       The original WASA Ordinance stipulated that DWASA would have a Board&#13;
of Directors consisting of thirteen members, mainly officials of the Government.&#13;
This arrangement was however not efficient in that as government bureaucrats, the&#13;
Board members had no decision-making authority and deferred all policy decisions&#13;
to the Government, through MLGRDC. The Ordinance was later amended to revise the&#13;
Board composition and create an internal Board of Directors, consisting of three&#13;
people.  This internal Board operated along functional lines, e.g., Finance,&#13;
Engineering, Administration; and the incumbents were effectively managers of&#13;
DWASA, without any policy responsibility.   DWASA was headed by a Chairman,&#13;
appointed by the Ministry of Local Government and responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
operations of the authority.   Key decisions regarding staffing, investment&#13;
decisions, remuneration and tariff setting were however made by the Government&#13;
and DWASA effectively operated as a Government department.  Under the reform&#13;
program in the proposed project, GOB has enacted a new WASA Ordinance to&#13;
strengthen and streamline DWASA's Board, commercialize its operations, and give&#13;
and DWASA more autonomy. The new Board consists of seven members most of whom&#13;
have been has been selected from outside the Government. The objective of this&#13;
streamlining is to create a Board along the lines of commercial utilities.&#13;
Additionally, the Board's role on policy matters relating to corporate planning,&#13;
tariff setting, staffing and appointment of senior staff has been clearly spelt&#13;
in a Policy Statement, adopted by DWASA with the objective of separating of the&#13;
roles and responsibilities of the Government, the Board, and management. Under&#13;
the new structure, the Government's role will be limited to that of a&#13;
shareholder, setting the general policy environment within which DWASA will&#13;
operate, while the Board's overall responsibility would be the implementation of&#13;
the Government's policy. In addition, the appointment of the Chairman and senior&#13;
staff would be on the basis of recommendation of the management. The revised&#13;
WASA Ordinance was reviewed by IDA during preparation and found satisfactory.&#13;
A Policy Statement describing the functions and responsibilities of the new DWASA&#13;
Board shown at Annex 2.2, has been adopted.&#13;
5.3       DWASA's  present  organization  structure  is  divided  along  three&#13;
functional departments, viz., Administration, Engineering and Commercial. The&#13;
Administration Department provides the administrative support services, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
public relations. The Commercial Department handles the billing and collection&#13;
of revenues, and provides the accounting and financial control functions. The&#13;
Engineering Department is responsible for operating and maintaining the utility&#13;
systems and in implementing project. DWASA's current organization structure and&#13;
the proposed new structure are attached at Annex 10.1. Under the project, an&#13;
organizational study will be undertaken to identify the features essential to an&#13;
effective organization and set up an incentive system for DWASA staff.  This&#13;
study will be undertaken and the results implemented under the Twinning Program.&#13;
An additional organization change is the creation of profit and/or cost centers,&#13;
in order to introduce transparency and accountability in DWASA's operations. The&#13;
new structure will separate water production from distribution, and a transfer&#13;
price will be established between the two units.   The Twinning Program&#13;
Consultants will assist DWASA in finalizing the reorganization and in setting up&#13;
the accounting system and the staffing for each profit/cost center.&#13;
C. Operations and Maintenance&#13;
5.4       DWASA's operational performance is affected by several institutional&#13;
weaknesses. These include production and distribution inefficiency; inadequate&#13;
performance monitoring; inefficient billing and revenue collection practices; a&#13;
very high level of unaccounted-for water; poor institutional management and lack&#13;
of clear regulatory responsibility. Maintenance is carried out in response to&#13;
consumer complaints and component failures. Routine maintenance is not usually&#13;
planned or allocated adequate resources. Maintenance is also hampered by lack&#13;
of proper spare parts and procurement planning. Because much of the system is&#13;
over thirty years old, leakage is very common, leading to substantial water loss.&#13;
To improve operational efficiency, the Twinning Program will focus on improved&#13;
operations and maintenance, management efficiency, and implementation of improved&#13;
utility management practices. The Twinning Program will cover operations and&#13;
maintenance, billing and collection, metering, financial management and training.&#13;
Terms of Reference for this program are shown in Annex 8.1. The signing of the&#13;
contract for the Twinning Program Consultants will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
5.5       Under the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project (Credit 1734-BD), a pilot&#13;
leak detection program was undertaken in two zones to identify physical leaks and&#13;
implement a program to rehabilitate the distribution system. A Consumer Survey&#13;
was also completed in May 1993 to identify and correctly classify all consumers,&#13;
and upgrade DWASA's customer data base. To improve systems maintenance, a Leak&#13;
Detection and Rehabilitation Program will be implemented under this project as&#13;
a follow-up to the program in the previous project (para. 5.10).  To further&#13;
improve operational efficiency, the reform program also includes actions to&#13;
establish and enforce accountability by requiring DWASA to meet agreed&#13;
operational and financial performance targets. These will be enforced through a&#13;
Performance Agreement to be signed -between DWASA and the Government which will&#13;
set out the operational, implementation and financial performance targets that&#13;
DWASA should achieve yearly. Some of the targets will include: (i) achievement&#13;
of agreed operating cost or revenue levels every year; (ii) reduction in&#13;
unaccounted for water to agreed levels every year; (iii) reduction in accounts&#13;
receivable to agreed levels each year; and (iv) implementation of an acceptable&#13;
consumer connection program.&#13;
5.6       To  further  improve DWASA efficiency,  a strategy  study will  be&#13;
undertaken in the project to assess options for private sector participation in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
DWASA, and mobilization of private financing for its investment program. The&#13;
signing of a contract for the study will be a condition of effectiveness, and&#13;
implementation of the results of the study a dated covenant. Draft terms of&#13;
reference are shown at Annex 3.3.&#13;
D. Billing and Collections&#13;
5.7       Currently, about 110,177 of DWASA's 160,080 (about 69%) consumer&#13;
connections are metered. The remaining unmetered connections are billed on the&#13;
basis of plot size and property value, regardless of the amount of water&#13;
consumed. It is believed that the amount of actual consumption from non-metered&#13;
connections is significantly much higher than DWASA's estimates. DWASA carries&#13;
out meter readings on a bi-monthly basis, with half of the consumers billed in&#13;
one month and the remaining consumers billed in the following month. Billing&#13;
procedures have improved over the past five years, under initiatives undertaken&#13;
under the Third DWASA Project. However, more improvements are still required to&#13;
increase billing efficiency and reduce the level of un-billed water. Collections&#13;
have always lagged behind billings, and between 1990 and 1993, DWASA's revenue&#13;
collections were about 80% of billings, and accounts receivable arrears were&#13;
about 6.5 months of billings.  A major problem is irregular payments by the&#13;
Government for water supplied to Government departments and other public&#13;
corporations. Other problems include lack of an effective disconnection policy&#13;
and lack of a reliable information base on consumer accounts, which results in&#13;
some consumers not being billed.&#13;
5.8       Under the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project  (Credit  1734-BD),  a&#13;
Consumer Survey was undertaken to record and correctly classify all DWASA&#13;
customers. Using this information DWASA embarked on a program to disconnect&#13;
accounts over six months in arrears, implement computerized billing system and&#13;
update its billing records. This has resulted in some improvement in the level&#13;
of billing. This data base will also be used in the preparation of action plans&#13;
under the proposed project to improve billing and collection efficiency. The&#13;
programs and actions to be undertaken to improve billing and collection and&#13;
efficiency are as follows:&#13;
(a) contracting Out DWASA Services: As part of an efficiency drive to&#13;
improve billing and revenue collection, DWASA will commence a program&#13;
to contract out some of its services to local contractors. Details&#13;
of the program and contract outline are attached at Annex 2.4. The&#13;
contract calls for the reading of meters, preparation of bills,&#13;
delivery of bills and follow-up of defaulters in case of non-payment.&#13;
The program will start in two zones of DWASA's service area, which&#13;
were selected, among other things for potential revenue gains. The&#13;
experience gained in these two zones will be used for planning future&#13;
activities.&#13;
(b)  Crash Meter Installation Program:  To reduce unmetered consumption,&#13;
the project includes the implementation of crash program to install&#13;
meters in unmetered connections, to achieve a metering level of 95%&#13;
of its accounts by June 1998. The contract for the program has been&#13;
signed and work has started.&#13;
(c) Legislation to Reduce Water Loss: As part of the amendment to the&#13;
DWASA Ordinance, DWASA will be required to introduce regulations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
enact measures to reduce water loss, including penalties for obtaining&#13;
DWASA water illegally.   The measures have been incorporated into&#13;
DWASA's regulations, prepared under the revised Ordinance. A newly&#13;
formed unit called the System Monitoring and Water Prevention Circle&#13;
will be responsible for monitoring waste and illegal activities, and&#13;
enforcing penalties.&#13;
(d)  Reduction of Public Sector Arrears:  Of DWASA's total receivables,&#13;
arrears from government departments and public corporations comprise&#13;
-  about 21%.  Payment for these accounts are irregular, and accumulated&#13;
arrears adversely affect DWASA's cash flows.   The  Government has&#13;
agreed to take action to address the problem. The Government reduced&#13;
these arrears to no more than ninety days as a condition of&#13;
negotiations, and has now put in place mechanisms to address public&#13;
sector arrears including timely budgetary allocation of funds.&#13;
(e)  Billing  and  Collection  Performance  Targets.    As  part  of  the&#13;
performance objectives to be agreed between DWASA and the Government,&#13;
DWASA will be required to maintain its accounts receivables arrears&#13;
to no more than four months of its total billing by June 1998. This&#13;
will also be incorporated into the Project Agreement with IDA.&#13;
E. Unaccounted for Water&#13;
5.9       During a pilot leak detection and waste prevention program undertaken&#13;
in one operating zone, completed in 1991, it was estimated that, of the total&#13;
water produced by DWASA in that zone only 44% was billed.  The remainder was&#13;
attributed to administrative losses, (31%) and technical losses (25Z). The major&#13;
factors contributing to administrative losses were: (i) incomplete customer data&#13;
base;  (ii)    unmetered  service  connections;  (iii)  illegal  and  illegally&#13;
reconnected service connections; (iv) inaccurate and tampered meters; and (v)&#13;
wrong meter reading, faulty invoicing and rent seeking behavior by revenue&#13;
inspectors.   Technical losses were mainly caused by leaking pipes, service&#13;
connections, inoperational fittings, and overflow from tanks and pump stations.&#13;
Although reliable information is not available, DWASA's systems' losses are&#13;
between 45% to 50%.&#13;
5.10      The proposed project includes a comprehensive Leak Detection and&#13;
Distribution System Rehabilitation Program, to cover the remaining zones in the&#13;
DWASA service area. Results from the pilot program show that such a program will&#13;
reduce the level of unaccounted-for-water significantly.   The Leak Detection&#13;
Program will be undertaken in three phases.  Phase I is an Immediate Action&#13;
Program and Training for revisiting the pilot areas completed under the Credit&#13;
1734-BD, while Phase II would cover about 70,000 service connections, over a&#13;
period of three years, and Phase III would cover the remaining 80,000 service&#13;
connections.  The training to be undertaken in Phase I will consist of: (a)&#13;
preparation of maps and drawings of DWASA service area; (b) checking of available&#13;
instrumentation for performance, ordering of new instrumentation, and training&#13;
of staff in their operations and maintenance; (c) reporting leaks as originally&#13;
done in the service area to update the distribution network drawings; and (d)&#13;
analysis of results and updating of programs for infill, extension and&#13;
rehabilitation works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
5.11      The  first  phase  program  is  in  progress.    To  facilitate  the&#13;
implementation of the program, DWASA created the System Monitoring and Waste&#13;
Control Circle, whose responsibilities will be to coordinate all leak detection&#13;
activities, procure all required equipment, materials and services, and monitor&#13;
water use in DWASA service area and enforce measures to conserve water and reduce&#13;
wasteful water practices. The proposed program would reduce technical systems&#13;
losses. Terms of reference for the second and third phase activities are shown&#13;
at Annex 7.1. Together with other initiatives to reduce administrative losses&#13;
described above, it is expected that unaccounted for water will be reduced to 30%&#13;
by 2001.   Achievement of these targets of unaccounted for water will be&#13;
incorporated in the Performance Agreement to be signed between DWASA and GOB&#13;
(Annex 2.3).&#13;
F. Personnel Management and Training&#13;
5.12      DWASA's management and staff lack accountability, and do not have&#13;
incentives to perform duties efficiently and effectively. Management also lacks&#13;
the necessary skills and experience to manage and operate the institution, and&#13;
there are no clear institutional performance objectives and targets. DWASA's&#13;
staff is generally engineering oriented and the technical staff are of reasonable&#13;
quality.   There is, however a general lack of capability and weakness in&#13;
commercial and accounting section staff, in particular, revenue and meter&#13;
inspectors. In addition, DWASA is responsible for the operation and maintenance&#13;
of the Dhaka stormwater drainage system for which it has no technical staff.&#13;
5.13      As of January 1996, DWASA had a total staff of about 3,020 on a&#13;
permanent basis. This translates to a staffing ratio of about 20 employees per&#13;
1,000 connections, which would be considered high by most standards. However,&#13;
the staff/connection indicator does not provide a full picture of the staffing&#13;
situation in DWASA.   First, given the low cost and efficiency of labor in&#13;
countries like Bangladesh, labor tends to be substituted for capital, thus DWASA&#13;
is less capital intensive than other utilities in developed countries. Second,&#13;
in Dhaka, a lot of DWASA residential consumers live in apartment buildings where&#13;
consumption is not always individually metered; thus service to an apartment&#13;
building appears in DWASA's records as one connection. This limits the number&#13;
of connections and undermines the number of consumers. A more representative&#13;
indicator of staff efficiency would be the ratio of personnel costs to operating&#13;
costs.   This has been around 15% in DWASA, considerably lower than other&#13;
developing or developed countries.   While the project will not recommend a&#13;
reduction in staff, IDA will seek assurances that DWASA would only hire&#13;
additional staff based on needed expansion of service and scope of operations.&#13;
In addition, DWASA's Board will review its staffing structure on a regular basis&#13;
to determine required staffing levels.   This will be incorporated in the&#13;
Performance Agreement to be signed between the Government and DWASA.&#13;
5.14      To  improve  DWASA's  efficiency,  there  is  need  to  modify  the&#13;
organizational structure to rationalize staff responsibilities, introduce a&#13;
system of incentives to staff commensurate with their performance, and improve&#13;
their skills through appropriate training.   The following actions will be&#13;
introduced under the proposed project:&#13;
(a) the appointment of an experienced managing director and appropriately&#13;
skilled deputy managing directors from the private sector to head&#13;
critical units, e.g., commercial and finance; water production,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
distribution   and   administration,   with -measurable   objectives&#13;
established for judging their performance. To attract staff with the&#13;
necessary skills and experience, these managerial positions will&#13;
initially be filled by local contract staff on fixed term&#13;
appointments, to be initially financed from the project, but gradually&#13;
transferred to DWASA. The Managing Director has been appointed. By&#13;
March 1997 DWASA shall appoint Deputy Managing Directors for Finance&#13;
and  Administration,   Technical  and  Planning   and  Development&#13;
Departments.&#13;
(b) provision of technical assistance under the project to help DWASA&#13;
improve its management and technical capabilities to improve&#13;
efficiency in operations. This technical assistance will be through&#13;
the management operational support (twinning) program. The twinning&#13;
arrangement would be rendered over a period of four years, but&#13;
renewable every year with long and short term personnel, whose&#13;
duration would be determined during implementation, to provide the&#13;
most effective transfer of knowledge to assist the Managing Director&#13;
and his deputies. A critical task of the program will be to develop&#13;
performance objectives on which management and staff performance would&#13;
be assessed, and which would form the basis for performance incentives&#13;
and penalties.  Terms of reference for the Twinning Program are at&#13;
Annex 8.1.   In addition, preliminary studies leading to further&#13;
privatization be undertaken in the project, with the objective of&#13;
signing of a contract by mid-term review of the project. Terms of&#13;
reference for the preparatory activities are at Annex 3.3.&#13;
(c)  a staff rationalization program to be carried out by June 1997 under&#13;
the Twinning Program to assess staff strength and weaknesses, and to&#13;
ensure that staff are re-assigned to areas with staff shortages; and&#13;
(d) training programs in various areas, with emphasis on the commercial&#13;
operations  of water utilities.    The training programs will  be&#13;
developed under the management operational support (Twinning) Program.&#13;
Additional training is being provided under the first phase of the&#13;
Leak Detection and Rehabilitation Program (para. 5.10). Included in&#13;
this is an incentive system to be financed by DWASA, to motivate staff&#13;
working on leak identification and rehabilitation. DWASA has already&#13;
approved an incentive system for the staff on the leak detection&#13;
program, in line with the proposals made by IDA.&#13;

6.2       DWASA's past audited income statements show that between FY92 and&#13;
FY95, its total operating revenue increased by about 107% (i.e. 38% between FY92&#13;
and FY93, 25% between FY93 and FY94 and 21% between FY94 and FY96).   These&#13;
increases were partly due to tariff increases of 10% in October 1991 as an&#13;
adjustment against power cost increases, 15% in October 1992, and 10% in November&#13;
1993, and increased water production as a result of new tubewells commissioned&#13;
under the Third DWASA Project.   Despite these revenue improvements, DWASA's&#13;
performance was not altogether satisfactory.   Net profits  fluctuated from&#13;
marginal profits in FY92 and FY93; a loss in FY94 and a profit in FY95.  Electric&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
power costs (representing 56% of operating expenditures) increased by 83% mainly&#13;
due to increased pumping costs as a result of the drawdown of the groundwater&#13;
table in the service area. Interest charges also increased significantly during&#13;
the period, particularly in FY94, due to new loans incurred by DWASA.&#13;
6.3       DWASA's cash flow statements showed positive annual cash balances in&#13;
FY92, FY94 and FY95 and huge accumulated cash balances because:&#13;
(a) it did not service principal and interest due on its loans because of&#13;
lack of proper records in the Ministry of Finance (MOF). This left&#13;
DWASA with cash balances equivalent to the unpaid amounts (e.g., in&#13;
FY92, interest due according to the income statement was Taka 35.7&#13;
million, and interest actually paid, according to the cash flow&#13;
statement was Taka 15.0 million); and&#13;
(b) annual development grants disbursed by GOB and donor agencies for&#13;
investment programs, without regard to actual annual work programs to&#13;
be implemented, resulted in cash balances being carried forward, thus&#13;
enhancing DWASA's cash flow position.&#13;
These issues reveal the lack of financial accountability that exists in DWASA.&#13;
More importantly, they also reveal the lack of accountability and weakness within&#13;
the government establishment responsible for monitoring and enforcing payment of&#13;
actual debt service due. They also reveal weaknesses in audits, which should&#13;
highlight these issues. While accountability within DWASA would be addressed&#13;
under this project, the lack of proper debt service records in MOF, a systemic&#13;
problem affecting all Government agencies in Bangladesh, requires wider reforms&#13;
of public sector and civil service practices.&#13;
6.4       DWASA did not always meet the covenants agreed for the Third DWASA&#13;
Project (Credit 1734-BD) although overall, actual performance was close to the&#13;
agreed covenants, which were to achieve a rate of return on fixed assets of 5%&#13;
beginning in FY91 (DWASA's rate of return was 2.3% in FY92 and 4.7Z in FY93);&#13;
reduce accounts receivables arrears to six months of billings (DWASA achieved a&#13;
ratio of 6.35 months in FY92 and 5.9 months in FY93 and 4.0% in FY94); and meet&#13;
subsidiary loan obligations.   Outstanding debt service arrears were always&#13;
capitalized into new debt.&#13;
6.5       DWASA's erratic performance is due to a number of reasons, some of&#13;
which are:&#13;
(a) Inefficient operations: Despite high tariffs and low cost operations,&#13;
DWASA is an inefficient operator. These inefficiencies are passed on&#13;
to consumers in form inadequate service coverage, low quality supply&#13;
and high tariffs.&#13;
(b) Unaccounted for water: The level of unaccounted for water, estimated&#13;
to be as high as 50% (para. 5.9) reduces actual revenue substantially&#13;
and increases unit operating costs.&#13;
(c) Collections: DWASA was unable to collect all of its revenue billed;&#13;
the ratio of collections to billings fluctuated between 75% to 80Z&#13;
during the period. Some of the collection problems stem from consumer&#13;
resistance to pay for poor service, irregular payments by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Government for service provided and lack of a reliable system for&#13;
arrears follow-up and disconnection.&#13;
DWASA however had adequate cash reserves to service its debt (para. 6.3). As a&#13;
condition of appraisal, DWASA paid GOB Taka 400 million in FY94 to reduce its&#13;
debt service arrears.&#13;
6.6       Under  the project,  initiatives  to be  taken  to  improve  revenue&#13;
performance include the following:&#13;
(a)  commitment by DWASA to achieve agreed levels of financial performance&#13;
and cost recovery. These performance objectives will be established&#13;
in the Performance Agreement to be signed between DWASA and the&#13;
Government. The performance indicators to be achieved are shown at&#13;
Annex 12, and include collections to billings ratios; debt service&#13;
coverage; receivables/billings and debt/equity;&#13;
(b) an agreement by GOB to grant autonomy to DWASA to adjust tariffs on&#13;
an annual basis, based on an agreed inflation index. This agreement&#13;
would be reflected in the Operating Policy Statement which would form&#13;
the basis for DWASA operations;&#13;
(c) a comprehensive leak detection program (para. 5.5) to reduce technical&#13;
water losses, the Crash Meter Installation Program (para. 5.8(b) to&#13;
reduce unmetered connections and the program to contract out billing&#13;
and collections to enhance revenues (para. 5.8(a).&#13;
B. Balance Sheet and Fixed Assets&#13;
6.7       DWASA's audited balance sheets for FY92 to FY95 are shown at Annex&#13;
11.2. DWASA's long terms assets include stormwater drainage assets which were&#13;
transferred from DPHE in 1989, and water and sewerage investments financed by IDA&#13;
credits, ADB loans, and Japanese grants. Over 90% of DWASA's outstanding loans&#13;
are from IDA. DWASA's debt to equity ratio was about 20:80 during the period in&#13;
review, which indicates that DWASA is low leveraged. This is due to the fact&#13;
that: (a) Government allocations to various DWASA investments are usually in form&#13;
of grants and equity; (b) apart from IDA and ADB loans, there are apparently no&#13;
onlending terms for other bilateral funds transferred to DWASA, which are shown&#13;
as grants in its balance sheet; and (c) the value of drainage assets transferred&#13;
from DPHE in 1989 was treated as equity in DWASA's accounts. Because of this,&#13;
the level of equity increased much faster than debt during the years in review.&#13;
DWASA's debt level is, however, high when compared to the level of its&#13;
operations.   In FY93,  total debt service was  42% of revenue.   With the&#13;
introduction of additional loans under proposed project, DWASA's debt obligations&#13;
will be higher.   Improvements in efficiency, reductions in water losses and&#13;
regular tariff increases will therefore be critical to generate more revenues and&#13;
improve asset utilization. These issues are being addressed under the project&#13;
through performance enhancements and agreed targets, tariff increases to enable&#13;
DWASA to cover its costs, including additional debt service.&#13;
6.8       DWASA's current ratio, which ranged from 11.8:1 in FY92 to 7.3:1 in&#13;
FY95 is high by any standards.  This ratio reflects: (a) uncollected revenue&#13;
arrears for water billed including arrears from Government departments some of&#13;
which have been outstanding for years; (b) a high level of stocks for materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 _&#13;
and consumables, e.g., pipes, valves, meters which were procured under previous&#13;
projects, but never used, and some of which are now unusable and obsolete; (c)&#13;
a high level of advances for materials, representing funds advanced to&#13;
contractors, which are not reconciled with contractor's payments; and (d) a low&#13;
level of accounts payable due to the nature of its operations (payables mainly&#13;
consist of outstanding amounts on power bills). Actions to be taken under the&#13;
project to address these issues are:&#13;
(a) agreement with the Government on a system of allocating adequate funds&#13;
to Government departments and public institutions to enable them to&#13;
pay water bills and arrears in time. This would be included under the&#13;
Performance Agreement whereby DWASA would be allowed to offset&#13;
outstanding public sector arrears with debt service payments due to&#13;
the government in case of continuous failure to make payments to&#13;
ensure that by June 1997, public sector arrears are no more than 90&#13;
days of billings.&#13;
(b) an assessment and evaluation of all stores and inventories by March&#13;
1997, and agreement to sell or dispose all mismatched, obsolete and&#13;
slow-moving stocks by December 1997.  These actions will be dated&#13;
covenants and defined in the Performance Agreement;&#13;
(c) an assessment of all receivables to identify all uncollectible arrears&#13;
by March 1997 and agreement to write off uncollectible amounts by&#13;
December 1997.   These actions will be defined in the Performance&#13;
Agreement; and&#13;
(d) under a program to improve DWASA's accounting system to be undertaken&#13;
under the Twinning Arrangement, a reconciliation of outstanding&#13;
advances and writing off uncollectible amounts.&#13;
C.  Current Water and Sewerage Tariffs&#13;
6.9       DWASA has separate tariffs for metered and non-metered customers.  The&#13;
metered charge (which applies to about 76% of its customers) is Taka 15.84 per&#13;
1,000 gallons for domestic consumers and Taka 51.48 per 1,000 gallons for&#13;
commercial and industrial users. Unmetered customers are charged on the basis&#13;
of the valuation of the property supplied with the connection. Currently, this&#13;
is 22.62% of the annual valuation of the property for residential, community and&#13;
industrial buildings, prorated on a monthly basis. The sewerage charge is 100%&#13;
of the water tariff for all water and sewer connected buildings. A reduced water&#13;
and sewer rate applies to properties with water supply but unconnected to a sewer&#13;
line that is within 100 ft.  Annex 11.3 shows current tariff rates and other&#13;
charges and proposed tariff structures.&#13;
6.10      DWASA's tariffs, which are currently regulated by the Government, do&#13;
not reflect DWASA's cost structure and are not designed to respond to changes in&#13;
DWASA's financial requirements.  Tariff increases have been irregular in the&#13;
past.   However,  since 1985, adjustments have been more regular, with GOB&#13;
authorizing tariff increases of 10%, 15% and 10% between FY91 and FY94, resulting&#13;
in a total increase of 39Z.  Even with these recent increases, which makes&#13;
DWASA's tariffs high by South Asia standards, DWASA is still unable to fully meet&#13;
its total costs. Tariffs do not properly reflect the cost of service provided&#13;
to consumers because: (a) they convey the wrong economic signals, since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
inefficiencies and distortions (e.g., systems losses) are passed on to consumers;&#13;
(b) they do not give adequate guidance on whether there should be cross-subsidies&#13;
or the degree of such subsidies to the poor; (c) they do not provide enough&#13;
justification on the charges being applied to small, large, domestic or&#13;
commercial consumers; (d) they do not reflect externalities, (e.g., the cost of&#13;
treating pollution to the water supply and how this would be reflected in the&#13;
charges); and (e) being non-progressive, they encourage wasteful water&#13;
consumption practices, particularly among upper income and unmetered consumers.&#13;
6.11      To  address  these  concerns,  a  Tariff  Study was  completed  that&#13;
recommended a revised tariff structure. The new structure is progressive, and&#13;
would enable DWASA to address the needs of affordable water supply for the urban&#13;
poor and allow it to meet its financial requirements.   Implementation of the&#13;
revised system would be a dated credit covenant.   Tariff increases would be&#13;
included as part of the performance objectives, to be enforced under the&#13;
Performance  Agreement.    Agreement  has  also  been  reached  that  after  the&#13;
implementation of the revised structure, DWASA will be allowed to raise tariffs&#13;
annually by up to 5% as needed to reflect inflation, without Government approval.&#13;
A 10% tariff increase was implemented in FY94, as a condition of preappraisal.&#13;
D. Financial Proiections&#13;
6.12      DWASA's financial projections, and the assumptions used in developing&#13;
them are given in Annex 11.1 and 11.2. These projections are summarized below.&#13;

- 37 -&#13;
6.13      A major objective of the project is to improve the operational and&#13;
financial performance of DWASA. The proposed strategy is to cover all costs of&#13;
operations, including debt service within a period of four years, by FY99.&#13;
Improvements in DWASA's financial performance will come about as a result of: (a)&#13;
regular and automatic tariff adjustments tied to the Bangladesh inflation index&#13;
to cover increases in operating costs, as agreed annually between GOB and DWASA&#13;
and reflected in the Performance Agreement; (b) efficiency gains from operational&#13;
and financial improvements expected under the reform program, and through the&#13;
Twinning Program; (c) increased revenue from additional sales volume generated&#13;
by the proposed project and other initiatives, including the program to contract&#13;
out billing; and (d) reduced water losses as a result of the Crash Meter&#13;
Installation Program, and the Leak Detection and Rehabilitation Program. The&#13;
proposed efficiency improvements, including estimated tariff increases will be&#13;
incorporated into the Performance Agreement (Annex 2.3), which will be reviewed&#13;
by IDA and GOB to ensure compliance by DWASA.&#13;
E. Performance Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
6.14      DWASA has made some efforts to improve its planning capability and&#13;
management information systems over the last five years. Under the Third DWASA&#13;
Project, IDA assisted in this effort by helping to develop management information&#13;
systems and to improve efficiency. However, DWASA's systems are still inadequate&#13;
and further improvements are needed to help it accurately forecast its finances,&#13;
revenue and water demand, which are critical to its planning and financial&#13;
viability. Currently, budgetary control is very weak and needs to be improved&#13;
significantly. Improvements in planning, budgeting and financial reporting would&#13;
be introduced under the Twinning Program being undertaken is the project.&#13;
6.15      A set of operational and financial monitoring indicators developed&#13;
during project preparation are attached at Annex 12.1. These indicators will&#13;
constitute the basis for reviews by GOB and IDA on DWASA's financial and&#13;
operational performance during the period of project implementation. Particular&#13;
attention will be paid to the level of unaccounted for water; billings/accounts&#13;
receivable ratio; percentage of water connections with meters, and service&#13;
coverage.   These monitoring indicators will be included in the Performance&#13;
Agreement between DWASA and GOB, and will have the same legal standing as&#13;
covenants in the Project Agreement.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audits&#13;
6.16      Although the WASA Ordinance specified that DWASA would maintain a&#13;
single entry accounting system, DWASA has now adopted a double-entry accrual&#13;
based commercial accounting system, as required under previous IDA credit&#13;
covenants. The system is however not fully efficient to allow DWASA to operate&#13;
as a well managed commercial concern. First, the system is still manual, and&#13;
financial statements are prepared only once a year and seem to be geared mainly&#13;
to fulfilling IDA and GOB reporting requirements rather than as a financial&#13;
management tool. Under the project, the financial management system would be&#13;
improved to provide financial results promptly on a monthly basis and at&#13;
operational unit level. DWASA will first conduct a full review of its system,&#13;
prior to the appointment of the Twinning Program Consultant as a basis for the&#13;
implementation of a computerized improved information and accounting system that&#13;
facilitates the preparation of a balance sheet, profit and loss statement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
sources and application of funds statements, and other reports necessary for&#13;
DWASA's financial management, on a monthly basis throughout the financial year.&#13;
Terms of Reference for the review were discussed during appraisal and found to&#13;
be satisfactory. Implementation of the new system will be undertaken under the&#13;
Twinning Program.&#13;
6.17      Currently there are three levels of audits in DWASA:&#13;
(a)  Internal Audit:  This is mainly an integrated function associated with&#13;
the approval procedures for payments, and matters such as financial&#13;
authority  limitations  for  senior  officers.    It  does  not  check&#13;
inconsistencies in accounting systems, cash collections, billing&#13;
procedures, or advances to contractors.&#13;
(b)  Government Audit:    This  is  a compliance  audit  to  ensure  that&#13;
Government authority levels have not been exceeded, that procedures&#13;
are carried out as directed, that pay scales are followed, etc. This&#13;
audit, normally carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General&#13;
Bangladesh (Directorate of Audit) also reviews project specific&#13;
accounts to ensure that the project funds are used for the purpose for&#13;
which they were approved; and&#13;
(c)  External Audit:    Under  the old WASA Ordinance,  the  Government&#13;
appointed an external auditor, normally a public accounting firm. The&#13;
auditors produce a long-form report, which in other countries would&#13;
be regarded as management letter. Under requirements from previous&#13;
IDA credits the auditors also provide a separate opinion on DWASA's&#13;
Statement of Expenditure Accounts and Project Accounts. However, the&#13;
reports are of limited acceptability as they are not based upon&#13;
accepted international accounting and auditing standards.&#13;
6.18      The above arrangements will continue under the proposed project, and&#13;
the external audit would be enhanced by requiring that DWASA appoint auditors of&#13;
acceptable quality on a three year contract. To ensure that audited statements&#13;
are prepared in time, an agreement will be sought with GOB to have the statements&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year, i.e., December&#13;
31, each year. Beginning in FY97, the authority for appointment of auditors and&#13;
remuneration will be delegated to DWASA Board.&#13;

VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Proiect Benefits&#13;
7.1       The proposed project would introduce the first primary water treatment&#13;
plant in Dhaka and would therefore provide urgently needed safe water to the&#13;
area, relieving current water shortages, particularly to areas that are currently&#13;
not served by piped water. The project, when in full operation will supply 223&#13;
million cubic meters (50 IMGD) of potable water, equivalent to the consumption&#13;
requirements of 2.3 million people.   This will be the joint contribution of&#13;
additional capacity provided by the Saidabad treatment plant and the loss&#13;
reduction  activities.    The  economic value  of  this  additional  supply  is&#13;
considerable because it will reduce costs and allow an increase in consumption&#13;
by low income groups. These groups pay as much as Tk. 27.00 (US$0.675) per cubic&#13;
meter for water purchased in small volumes and consume as little as 30 lpd&#13;
(liters per capita per day), while the current DWASA price of water for&#13;
residential connection is Tk 3.49 (US$ 0.09) per cubic meter, and consumption of&#13;
the population served with direct residential connections, although low, is about&#13;
90 lpd.&#13;
7.2       The population of Dhaka as a whole will benefit from the additional&#13;
supply since it currently consumes an average of 90 lpd. The economic price of&#13;
this consumption is nearly Taka 15.00 (US$0.375) per cubic meter. The value of&#13;
the additional supply is therefore significant, as expected in a large and&#13;
growing city with relatively low consumption due to supply restrictions, large&#13;
water deficits, low coverage, and high costs for those without direct water&#13;
service.&#13;
7.3       Without the proposed project, water shortages would become more&#13;
critical, and it is estimated that, with the current population growth of the&#13;
City of Dhaka (estimated at 4%) per capita consumption in Dhaka would have to&#13;
decline and water supply coverage for the service area would drop from the&#13;
current 65% to about 45% by the year 2001.&#13;
B. Economic Rate of Return and Least-Cost Solution&#13;
7.4       The economic analysis of the project is shown at Annex 13.1  The&#13;
economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 22%. Net benefits amount&#13;
to Tk 4,823.93 million (US$120.60 million) which are more than 60% of the project&#13;
costs. This means that even if costs increase by 60%, the project will still be&#13;
economically feasible at a 10% discount rate.  Moreover, if only 60% of the&#13;
estimated benefits are obtained, the project is still economically feasible. The&#13;
main factor affecting project feasibility is the value of water since, as&#13;
mentioned previously, the willingness to pay is substantial and the estimates&#13;
used may be conservative, given the critical water supply situation in Dhaka and&#13;
its possible development in the coming years.   It must be noted that the&#13;
population growth estimates may also be conservative for a country with a large&#13;
rural population, few medium or large cities and high rural to urban migration&#13;
rate.&#13;
7.5       The proposed project represents the least cost solution and best&#13;
alternative. Four options were considered, which included the installation of&#13;
additional deep tubewells; the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water&#13;
and two surface water treatment options. Because of the decline in the water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
tables in the Dhaka area which has increased abstraction costs and limited the&#13;
availability of ground water in the Dhaka area, the continued use of groundwater&#13;
was not feasible as a solution to provide the required equivalent of the 50 mgd&#13;
water treatment plant (paras. 2.13 to 2.16). The other surface water treatment&#13;
options (plant at Buriganga River) were found to be to costly because of the need&#13;
for additional land acquisition; the need for river crossing; and pollution&#13;
problems on the Buriganga River.&#13;
7.6       It must be noted that the benefits of the project come from both the&#13;
increased capacity and the loss reduction activities. Capacity expansion itself,&#13;
that is, without reduction of losses, would be an economically marginal&#13;
investment.  Its net present value would be US$67.5 million (at 10% discount&#13;
rate) and its IRR is 11.9%.   Although loss reduction activities are highly&#13;
profitable in economic terms, with a net present value of US$ 18.5 million, by&#13;
themselves, they do not resolve the problem of rapidly growing deficits in any&#13;
significant manner. Furthermore, even though the IRR is higher for the loss-&#13;
reduction program, the net present value of the overall project (the first order&#13;
condition in this case) is more than six times greater.&#13;
7.7       A sensitivity  analysis of the project shows that if total investment&#13;
costs increase by 10%, the economic rate of return is reduced to 19.5%, while a&#13;
reduction in revenue of about 15% (resulting from inadequate reductions in&#13;
systems losses) reduces the economic rate of return to 17.8%. The rate of return&#13;
in both cases is above the 12% marginal cost of capital discount rate deemed&#13;
acceptable reasonable for such projects.&#13;
C. Fiscal Impact&#13;
7.8       The project's fiscal impact is expected to be positive.  Currently,&#13;
the Government implicitly subsidizes DWASA's net losses through the non-servicing&#13;
of debt charges by DWASA. Since the objective of the project is to reduce these&#13;
losses, this implicit subsidy will be eliminated. In addition, GOB charges a 15%&#13;
tax on DWASA water and sewerage revenues.   Since the project will increase&#13;
DWASA's revenues, the net revenue flows to the Government over the life of the&#13;
projects asset will be positive. The project will, therefore, not distort the&#13;
Government's budget priorities.&#13;
D. Impact on Urban Poor&#13;
7.9       The urban poor will benefit from this project through reduced costs&#13;
for water.   Currently the poor pay a high price for small volumes of water&#13;
purchased daily. Access to direct connections substantially reduces the cost of&#13;
water and increases their consumption.   Benefits to this income group would&#13;
include improved sanitation services from the sanitation component under the&#13;
project, although this is difficult to quantify. It is estimated that about 45%&#13;
of the people in Dhaka are below the poverty line. The project would serve an&#13;
additional 500,000 people, and reduce suppressed demand over the DWASA service&#13;
area.  It has been estimated that the additional water supplied would serve&#13;
250,000 people below the poverty line.&#13;
7.10      The provision of water through house connections to this income group&#13;
would also have considerable impact of freeing the urban poor, particularly women&#13;
from the task of carrying water from public standposts. The introduction of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
progressive tariff structure under the project would have the added benefit of&#13;
cross-subsidizing the poor, thus ensuring equity in the availability of water&#13;
supply.&#13;
E. Environmental Impact&#13;
7.11      An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project was carried&#13;
out by BCEOM (French Engineering Consultants) with local partners EPC&#13;
(Engineering and Planning Consultants Ltd.) during the period February-April&#13;
1994.  A Draft Final Report is available, dated April 1994.  Details of the&#13;
analysis are provided in Annex 14.1. The consultants specifically investigated&#13;
the impact of the 50 IMGD increment which would be supplied to the DWASA system&#13;
from the Sitalakhya River through the first phase Saidabad Treatment Plant, yet&#13;
were mindful that future additional increments of treatment plant investments (up&#13;
to a total of 200 IMGD) are expected at the same site, and raw water conveyance&#13;
is expected to be located along the same route.   Key environmental impacts&#13;
identified include the following:&#13;
(a) for raw water quality: positive impacts through continuing monitoring&#13;
of raw water quality at source and long-term protection of water&#13;
quality, through restriction of industrial discharges;&#13;
(b) for raw water intake and transmission, construction and operation:&#13;
some possible long term effects on river flows during the dry season;&#13;
land based effects along the transmission alignment (both physical and&#13;
social), short-term construction and nuisance effects;&#13;
(c) for surface water treatment plant construction and operation: long-&#13;
term physical and social effects at the site, short-term construction&#13;
nuisance; and&#13;
(d) for treated water distribution network: short-term construction&#13;
nuisance, especially traffic disruption, long-term impacts on public&#13;
health and disposal of wastewater.&#13;
7.12      Positive impacts include the provision of a 50 IMGD increment of&#13;
treated surface water supply to the DWASA system, planned conjunctive use of&#13;
ground and surface (thus reducing groundwater overpumping), and improved&#13;
environmental management and monitoring of the water sources as a result of the&#13;
Water Resources Management Study to be undertaken under the project.&#13;
Commencement of the implementation of the results of this study will be a dated&#13;
credit covenant. Positive impacts will be strengthened by the concurrent program&#13;
of leak detection and rehabilitation which will enable greater pressures to be&#13;
maintained in the distribution system and system integrity to be improved, with&#13;
greater amenity and public health benefits.  The treated surface water is to be&#13;
supplied to areas of the city where groundwater drawdown is most severe, thus&#13;
allowing the groundwater resources to recover from overpumping.   Potential&#13;
negative impacts of the project include: (i) the increased discharge of&#13;
wastewater to the shallow surface aquifer through (a) household on-plot&#13;
sanitation facilities, (b) the existing sewerage system, and (c) surface drainage&#13;
channels; (ii) further growth in urban development (supported by the increased&#13;
availability of water supply through the project); and (iii) necessary&#13;
restriction or regulation of industrial and other discharges along a stretch of&#13;
the Sitalakhya River in the vicinity of the raw water intake (to be further&#13;
investigated in the water resource management study). Mitigation measures are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
being incorporated in the project to reduce or eliminate the potential negative&#13;
impacts associated with necessary fencing of the DND Canal, including the removal&#13;
and relocation of shacks used by small businesses, the removal of domestic and&#13;
commercial washing points along the canal, and the production of large volumes&#13;
of sludge. During negotiations. IDA and GOB agreed on the establishment of an&#13;
environmental cell within DWASA to monitor water qualitV and advise on&#13;
environmental issues, as a credit covenant.&#13;
F. Affordability&#13;
7.13      Surveys  conducted during project  preparation  indicated  that  the&#13;
present tariffs are considered affordable for both residential and industrial&#13;
use, being between 2.8% of monthly income for consumers with an average income&#13;
of between Taka 1,000 and 3,000 to 1.0% for consumers with an average income of&#13;
over Taka 20,000. The critical test for affordability is however, the low income&#13;
population. Using the minimum wage of Taka 1,400 per month and assuming a per&#13;
capita consumption of 30 lpcd in a family with 6.5 people, the cost per month&#13;
would be Taka 21.10 representing 1.5% of the minimum wage.   Even with the&#13;
expected tariff revisions under this project, the monthly cost of water would&#13;
still be below the 5% to 7Z percentage considered standard in other countries.&#13;
At a consumption of 30 lpcd, and if the current income tariffs is doubled the&#13;
water bill would be below 5% for all consumers except those with a monthly income&#13;
of Taka 900.00.&#13;
G. Proiect Risks&#13;
7.14      The main risk of this project is delays in implementation of the&#13;
various components of the project, causing postponement in overall project&#13;
completion. DWASA has adequate experience in the implementation of World Bank&#13;
financed projects, and with the assistance of consultants for construction&#13;
supervision, the proposed project should be implemented without major delays.&#13;
DWASA's experience was evident under the Third DWASA Project (Credit 1734-BD),&#13;
in which major civil works were completed before the original closing date. In&#13;
addition, the main civil works under the project will be contracted before Board&#13;
discussion of the IDA credit. This should help mitigate some of the risks of&#13;
delays. With its own financing, GOB has already commenced the implementation of&#13;
two components critical in the project to speed implementation.&#13;
7.15      The other major risk is the possibility that the Government and DWASA&#13;
may not follow through with the reforms under the project, due to political&#13;
constraints, and possible resistance to reforms by major interest groups. To&#13;
minimize this risk, IDA's project processing was preceded by continued policy&#13;
dialogue with the Government. The risk was approached by requiring the taking&#13;
of upfront action on the reform programs as a means of demonstrating commitment.&#13;
The National Cabinet has approved a program of reform. The Government is in the&#13;
process of amending the regulatory framework, recruiting private sector managers,&#13;
and has started the Leak Detection program. Annual comprehensive reviews and a&#13;
mid-term review of project progress against specific performance objectives would&#13;
provide opportunity for corrective action if necessary.&#13;

(d) execution of the French and Japanese Grant Agreements (para.&#13;
3.13).&#13;
8.4            With the above agreements and assurances, the proposed project&#13;
will constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 51.0 million (US$80.3&#13;
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity to the People's&#13;
Republic of Bangladesh.&#13;

FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Water Supply and Demand&#13;
Proiect Area&#13;
1.         DWASA' a service  area  includes  Dhaka City  and  the  township  of&#13;
Narayanganj, located to the south-east of the Dhaka metropolitan area. DWASA's&#13;
service area is bounded by the Tongi River in the North and the Balu River in the&#13;
East, the Lakhya River in the South East and the Buriganga River in the South-West.&#13;
For purposes of the proposed project, the relevant area has been defined as a part&#13;
of the Dhaka Statistical Metropolitan Area, which in turn is part of Greater Dhaka.&#13;
It comprises the present urbanized area which is also the Dhaka WASA Service Area,&#13;
and includes Dhaka City, Narayanganj, and two suburban areas, North and South. The&#13;
area has been divided into 36 elementary urban zones (EUZ), according to current&#13;
land use patterns. The population of each of the 36 EUZs was projected from the&#13;
results of the 1981 census, and updated during the 1993 census.&#13;
Population&#13;
2.          Between 1974 and 1981, total population in Dhaka City increased by over&#13;
6Z per annum.  In 1981, the population of Dhaka was 2.3 million people.  This&#13;
increased to 3.5 million in FY91. Population growth rates for the sub-urban areas&#13;
are not very reliable. However, detailed population estimates for each EUZ were&#13;
prepared on the basis of: (a) the existing land use (i.e. agriculture, commercial,&#13;
industrial, etc.); and (b) the expected land use patterns in future by taking into&#13;
account the possible extension of housing areas, the present population density and&#13;
the rate of urbanization. Population projections for the years 1994, 2000, 2010&#13;
and 2020 were prepared and are summarized below in Table 1.&#13;
Table 1: Population Proiections&#13;
1981     1991       1995      2000       2010       2020&#13;

Dhaka City      2,273,357   3,804,140   4,355,216   5,025,655   6,174,268    7,172,236&#13;
Narayanganj      197,733    252,977    313,394    414,523    598,621  785,069&#13;
Suburban (North)  120,615    246,888    330,258    465,427    902,990    1,349,409&#13;
Suburban (South)  286,474    512,381    649,123    872,736   1,585,515    2,910,328&#13;
The projections shows that the population of the DWASA service area will grow to&#13;
6.8 million, and 12.6 million by the years 2000 and 2020 respectively. The higher&#13;
growth rates will be in Narayanganj and the suburban zones north and south of the&#13;
city, rather than in Dhaka City itself. A large percentage of this population will&#13;
continue to live in slum areas with minimum water service and poor housing. These&#13;
estimates seem reasonable even conservative, given probable rural-urban migration&#13;
rates in a country with a large rural population and a growing industrial base.&#13;
This growth will add pressure for DWASA to increase system coverage.&#13;
Coverage&#13;
3.           It is estimated that 3.53 million people (65% of the population), are&#13;
served by the DWASA system through direct household connections. Since the number&#13;
of residential connections was 130,143 (June 1994), the average number of persons&#13;
per connection is about 26; there are 3 to 4 households per connection, on average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
This is high for urban standards. Actual coverage is difficult to estimate because&#13;
of the substantial volume of floating population and slum dwellings. The meaning&#13;
of service coverage is in itself particular to the characteristics of Dhaka.&#13;
Coverage would be best defined in terms of access; that is, in terms of providing&#13;
the non-connected population with access to potable water not necessarily through&#13;
household  connections.    The  1,680  stand  posts  (street  hydrants)  still  in&#13;
operation'  are estimated to supply water to 300,000 people.   The remaining&#13;
population - 1.6 million people - use "neighboring" connections both legal and&#13;
illegal, purchase water in small volumes from other users and DWASA trucks, and use&#13;
hand pumps in fringe areas. In this context, community stand posts and other forms&#13;
of delivery to irregular holdings could be part of DWASA's strategy to increase&#13;
coverage (access).&#13;
Level of Consumption&#13;
4.             Current per capita production from DWASA sources, using June 1994&#13;
data, is 136.45 lpd. Assuming 34% physical losses (estimated as shown in para 12),&#13;
per capita consumption would be 90.05 lpd. However, DWASA supplies only a small&#13;
fraction of non-domestic (industrial, commercial, government institutions)&#13;
consumption.   Private deep tubewells (DTWs) supply the bulk of these sectors'&#13;
consumption. For a city like Dhaka, consumption of the non-domestic sector may be&#13;
as much as 24 million m for each million peog1e. This would amount to 130 million&#13;
m3 of which DWASA supplies only 13 million m . This implies an additional 59 lpd&#13;
as consumption by the non-domestic sectors not presently supplied by DWASA.&#13;
Therefore, total estimated consumption would be 149 lpd. This is still low for a&#13;
city like Dhaka taking into account its climatic conditions and the fact that it&#13;
is the country's main commercial and industrial center as well as the location of&#13;
all national government institutions.&#13;
5.          Average consumption for the population with direct connections is&#13;
102.18 lpd; for the non-domestic sectors combined; consumption from DWASA sources&#13;
is the equivalent of 6.55 lpd. The 300,000 people using stand posts consumed 62&#13;
lpd (assuming that 1,680 stand posts deliver 18,630 m3 daily2).  The remainder of&#13;
the population (not connected), 1.6 million people I consume 46.3 lpd, assuming that&#13;
they "recover" 10% of production from the system . The weighted average of these&#13;
values is 90.05 lpd.  It is estimated that I million slum dwellers consume an&#13;
average of 30 lpd.4&#13;
1 According to some accounts DWASA has attempted to close stand posts, as&#13;
regular connections are installed, because it cannot control their use. The&#13;
government paid Tk 14.02 million (US$ 350,500) for water consumed from stand&#13;
posts in 1993-94.&#13;
2On the basis of 2,500 gallons per day per post.&#13;
3 These estimates are based on a total production reported by WASA of 740.9&#13;
million 1/day (June 1994 MIR) and estimated population of 5.43 million.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
Industrial and Commercial Consumption&#13;
6.          Private companies mainly use their own tubewell installations for their&#13;
water supply needs. Currently, industrial and commercial consumers connected to&#13;
DWASA represent only 3,170 connections (i.e. about 2Z of total connections). In&#13;
FY93, industrial and commercial consumption represented 11X of total water&#13;
consumption, and contributed about 28Z of the total revenue.   However, future&#13;
industrial consumption from DWASA water is likely to be influenced by the&#13;
government policy concerning groundwater abstraction by industries, which is&#13;
affecting the levels of the water table.  In this context, legislation already&#13;
exists to discourage industrial and commercial users from excessive groundwater&#13;
abstraction,  through a levy on tubewells based on tubewell sizes.   However,&#13;
enforcement is lax and most industrial and commercial consumers continue to use&#13;
tubewells without the payment of the levy. The Water Resources Management Study&#13;
to be undertaken under the project will recommend measures and legislation to&#13;
regulate water abstraction by industrial and commercial users.&#13;
Demand Proiections&#13;
7.          As for any other commodity, demand growth for potable water services&#13;
is a function of market size (population) growth, consumer's income growth and&#13;
prices.  The effect of each depends on its elasticity which measures consumers&#13;
response  to changes  in each variable.    There  are no  estimates  of  demand&#13;
elasticities for water in Dhaka, and they are difficult to estimate because actual&#13;
demand is unobservable due to permanent supply restrictions, and adequate data is&#13;
not available. It is evident, however, that - at current prices - demand is far&#13;
larger than supply.&#13;
8.          If we consider at least two markets: low income and other income&#13;
consumers, there may be a decline in consumption by the latter due to an increase&#13;
in the tariff, as waste is reduced. For the low income group, this effect is small&#13;
due to their already low consumption; however, the relevant impact for this group&#13;
is related to service coverage: an increase in coverage normally implies a&#13;
substantial reduction in cost for the newly connected customer and therefore a&#13;
significant increase in consumption. As shown above, consumption per capita from&#13;
direct connections is higher than from stand posts and the latter is higher than&#13;
per capita consumption for the population without connection.   The evidence is&#13;
overwhelming with respect to the high cost of water to the urban poor when they do&#13;
not have a direct connection. In the case of Dhaka this could be as much as eight&#13;
times the average tariff.&#13;
9.          The implication of these arguments is that, under the particular&#13;
circumstances of the Dhaka water supply system - especially in the absence of the&#13;
rationing effect of an adequate tariff, population and service coverage become by&#13;
far the main factors affecting any changes in water requirements in the near&#13;
future.   That is, the level of consumption (consumption per capita) is not a&#13;
function of price and income but of available supply; therefore, projected demand&#13;
depends on assumed consumption per capita since for all realistic prices, currently&#13;
and in the near future, there will be excess demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
10.          If per capita consumption is approximately 156 lpd currently5 and is&#13;
expected to increase by 1% in the coming years due to the effect of increased&#13;
coverage and higher incomes, demand would be as shown in Table 2. These estimates&#13;
should be interpreted with caution because, in economic terms, at current low&#13;
tariffs, demand is substantially higher than consumption.   Therefore,  for all&#13;
probable increases in the water tariff, available increments in supply will be&#13;
quickly exhausted. At current prices, demand is almost twice as the current level&#13;
of consumption. If deficits shown in Table 2 are not met, per capita consumption&#13;
will have to decline due to the high rate of population increase. In Table 2, it&#13;
is assumed that per capita consumption stops increasing at 166 lpd in 1999; this&#13;
is to reflect rationing either through increased tariffs, scheduled cut-offs, or&#13;
just lack of water as growing per capita consumption cannot be sustained due to the&#13;
massive investments that it would require.&#13;

Capacity and Production&#13;
11.          More than 95Z of DWASA's installed capacity is comprised of Deep&#13;
Tubewells (DTW). In recent years, DWASA has been improving this system through&#13;
rehabilitation and replacement of DTWs; capacity has also been increased&#13;
significantly since the BCEOM Study was completed (1992).   The main problem,&#13;
however, is the status of the distribution network. The BCEOM Study surveyed the&#13;
different components of the network and found that in general the network is&#13;
inadequate for the size of the system and is in precarious condition; physical&#13;
losses between 30 and 50 percent were found depending on location, age of the&#13;
network, maintenance, and water pressure. According to DWASA officials, some&#13;
segments of the network are in such poor condition that they are no longer&#13;
maintained; instead they must wait to be replaced when they break down&#13;
completely. The Leak Detection and Waste Prevention Programme investigated two&#13;
5 Per capita consumption from the system is 66% of production, or 90.05 lpd;&#13;
59 additional lpd are consumed from non-WASA sources, for a total of 149.05 lpd&#13;
currently.&#13;

* DWASA, Annual Report 1992-93 ; b DWASA PLanning Division; C Wasa's estimate is 8.974 (June 1994 MIR).&#13;
12.        Table 3 shows the system's capacity changes since 1991 up to 1996.&#13;
Currently, there are 190 DTWs in operation and 20 under construction which,&#13;
together with the surface water treatment plants at Chandnighat and Narayanganj&#13;
and an estimated 3.0 m /s from private DTWs, amount to a total available capacity&#13;
of 14.267 m3/s  (271 IMGD).6 for 1995.   Expansion of the Chandnighat and&#13;
Narayanganj plants increased capacity to 14.974 m3/s in 1996.7&#13;
13.         DWASA reported production was 8.25 m3/s during 1993-94 of which 51.5%&#13;
was billed. This production can only be expanded marginally due to limitations&#13;
in the distribution system; and increased supply to the current network will&#13;
increase  losses  significantly.    According  to  the  Leak  Detection  pilot&#13;
investigation, at very low pressures, physical losses are already at more than&#13;
25%.&#13;
14.         Private Tubewells.  The BCEOM Study did not take into account the&#13;
existing capacity of private tubewells as source of water supply in the study&#13;
area. Private tubewells are licensed by DWASA when it is demonstrated that DWASA&#13;
is unable to meet the applicant's supply requirements.  According to DWASA's&#13;
records, 284 deep tubewells have been licensed. However, the Consumer Survey&#13;
1992-93 found 358 private tubewells. Normally they are between 2 and 8 inches&#13;
in diameter, compared to 8 inches for all DWASA DTWs, and their operating time&#13;
is also less.  Assuming that, on average, each private DTW produces 20Z of the&#13;
average DWASA DTW, the 358 private DTWs could add as much as 117 million m3 to&#13;
the city's water supply annually. The environmental impact assessment report for&#13;
the project  estimated  a volume  of  76 million m3  annually  as  "private&#13;
abstraction." An assessment by the ADB estimates 250 DTWs producing 50 million&#13;
m3. It must be noted that the supply from these sources is not readily available&#13;
to the distribution network; it is illegal to supply water from private DTWa&#13;
6 1.0 m3/s - 19 (approx.) IMGD (Imperial million gallons per day).&#13;
7 Capacity of DWASA's DTWs has been estimated assuming 52 l/s (4500 m3/day)&#13;
per DTW which is the rated capacity. DWASA's estimate is slightly less (47.23 l/s).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
outside the applicant's requirements but this is clearly not enforced. For the&#13;
purposes of measuring total available capacity, private DTWs are estimated to add&#13;
94.6 million m3/year or 3.0 m3/s.&#13;
15.         It is difficult to accurately determine the volume of private&#13;
production since many DTWs have not been registered with DWASA and operators are&#13;
unwilling to provide information.   There are probably more DTWs than those&#13;
reported in the Consumer Survey; during the survey, there was considerable&#13;
resistance to provide information.   Their estimated capacity (3 m /8) is an&#13;
approximated average of the first two estimates mentioned above. Private DTWs&#13;
are also highly underutilized but their capacity is not available to the network,&#13;
and it is unknown whether it is technically feasible to increase their capacity&#13;
significantly due to possible drawdown problems.&#13;
16.         Losses.  Physical losses are estimated at 34% currently.  This level&#13;
may be higher but the data on Unaccounted For Water (UFW) is not reliable since&#13;
the method of estimating non-metered consumption does 8not have anything to do&#13;
with water consumption but with property rental values.  Estimates of UFW range&#13;
from 30% to 56%.   In order to estimate physical losses, given the lack of&#13;
reliable data, the following assumptions were made: only 40% of water produced&#13;
is delivered to water connections (the BCEOM survey found between 30 and 50&#13;
percent losses due to leaks)9; of this volume 8% is consumed by the industrial,&#13;
commercial and government sectors (from water billing); an estimated 300,000&#13;
people consume 18.63 mld from stand posts or street hydrants.  The remaining&#13;
population not directly connected to the network "recovers" 10% of total WASA&#13;
production through legal and illegal connections, purchases, etc.  Estimated&#13;
losses are 251.91 Mld, equivalent to 46.39 lpd. This is 34% of DWASA production.&#13;
Deficits&#13;
17.          Assuming that water production is maintained at the current level&#13;
of 86% of capacity, and losses are reduced gradually from 34% to 20% in 10 years,&#13;
production is projected as shown in Table 2. Based on projected demand, water&#13;
deficits are then estimated.   The current deficit is 1.37 m3/s assuming per&#13;
capita consumption of 150 lpd.   However, private production is not readily&#13;
available to the network but only to the consumers who own the private DTWs.&#13;
With current capacity, by 1998 the water deficit will be approximately equal to&#13;
the net capacity of the Saidabad I Surface Water Treatment Plant (2.63 m3/s).&#13;
The additional supply will be consumed immediately, even if tariffs are increased&#13;
significantly (or for any realistic tariff increase).&#13;
18.         Despite recent expansion of the number of DWASA DTWs, and the number&#13;
of private tubewells, it has been difficult to reduce water shortages; this&#13;
requires significant increments in capacity; therefore, a deficit remains every&#13;
year which is simply met by not providing full coverage, not meeting residential&#13;
demand and not addressing the non-residential demand question.  Some of this&#13;
8 Water consumption for non-metered connections is estimated by dividing the&#13;
water bill (22.62% of the property's rental value) by the tariff.&#13;
9 The Leak Detection Programme pilot study found at least 25% losses through&#13;
pipes and service connections based on a survey of 2 small areas of the city with&#13;
very low pressures. It did not take into account losses in main lines feeding the&#13;
specific areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
deficit would be covered by non-WASA sources. Moreover, it is unlikely that&#13;
these deficits could be covered by increasing the number of DTWs. Considerable&#13;
discussion has taken place recently on the capacity of the aquifer to sustain&#13;
growing abstraction.   Further development of ground sources will have to be&#13;
gradual and after careful study of location and existing DTWs. A study of ground&#13;
water management has been included in the proposed project.&#13;
Suzmmary&#13;
19.         DWASA's total water production capacity is currently estimated at&#13;
192 IMGD. About 95% of this capacity is from groundwater through 190 tubewells,&#13;
which have a total capacity of 780 MLD (173 IMGD).   The remaining capacity&#13;
(19 IMGD) is from the Narayanganj Treatment Plant (9 IMGD) and the Chandnigat&#13;
Treatment Plant (10 IMGD).   Projections of increases in DWASA's production&#13;
capacity are shown below with investment assumptions.&#13;
20.         Even with  the  capacity  above,  DWASA's  current  production  is&#13;
substantially below capacity. Current production is estimated at about 166 IMGD&#13;
(i.e. 86% of capacity). Although actual water billed is approximately half of&#13;
this production, the level of consumption is higher due to illegal connections,&#13;
underbilling and other "administrative losses". In addition, the actual level&#13;
of production is not known, and DWASA has normally estimated on the basis of non-&#13;
revenue water and billed consumption.   In calculating the level of water&#13;
shortages, it is assumed that DWASA will operate tubewells at 95% of capacity and&#13;
treatment plants at full capacity.  Based on these assumptions, the expected&#13;
water shortages are shown below.&#13;

FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
The Institutional Reform Program&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.          The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has been trying to satisfy the&#13;
increasing demand for water arising from the rapid population expansion,&#13;
particularly in the urban areas of Dhaka and Chittagong. Since 1963, IDA has&#13;
financed five water supply projects in Dhaka and Chittagong, totalling US$108&#13;
million. IDA's fundamental objective in the sector has been to support GOB in&#13;
providing equitable and improved access to basic water supply and sanitation&#13;
services. To address these concerns IDA has focused on three areas of&#13;
potential improvements: (a) to support the development of effective sector&#13;
institutions through the establishment of the Dhaka and Chittagong Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage Authorities (WASAs); (b) to promote long term planning of&#13;
capital investments through the identification of needs for expansion and the&#13;
constraints on capital investments; and (c) to strengthen financial discipline&#13;
and lessen the sector's reliance on limited public resources through the&#13;
direct recovery of most or all of the costs through user charges.&#13;
Notwithstanding IDA's emphasis on institutional strengthening, the water&#13;
supply network in Dhaka remains grossly inadequate and the performance of the&#13;
water sector entity (DWASA) remains very poor. There is an urgent need to&#13;
increase access to basic water supply and sanitation services, and improve&#13;
DWASA's capacity to operate efficiently and generate adequate revenues to&#13;
cover all costs of operations, including debt service. Currently, water&#13;
supply coverage in Dhaka is between 50-60%.&#13;
2.          The poor performance of DWASA is due to:  (a) GOB's inadequate&#13;
management of the sector and excessive control on DWASA's operations as&#13;
evidenced by the increasing interference in the day-to-day operations; and (b)&#13;
the poor institutional capabilities of DWASA to effectively manage and operate&#13;
its facilities including a lack of capable management, trained manpower and&#13;
clear operating objectives, resulting in poor cost recovery, a high level of&#13;
system losses and inadequate billing and revenue collection practices.&#13;
3.          Sector Management:  Overall management of the water supply sector&#13;
is characterized by excessive government control and interference, and too&#13;
much dependence by DWASA on the Government budget for its capital operating&#13;
expenditures. While the WASA Ordinance empowers DWASA to formulate, execute&#13;
and maintain water supply and sanitation schemes, impose rates and charges on&#13;
users, management decisions, including tariff setting, staffing and investment&#13;
planning are controlled by the Government. On the other hand, there are&#13;
neither defined government policy guideline for sectoral development nor&#13;
mandates for sector entities. The current DWASA Board is staffed by&#13;
representatives of Government agencies, and there are no incentives or&#13;
initiatives by DWASA staff to operate efficiently. Water tariffs, regulated&#13;
by the Government, neither reflect cost structures nor meet financial&#13;
requirements of the operating entities, and adjustments have been irregular in&#13;
the past. While DWASA is able to fully cover its operating costs, it is&#13;
unable to fully cover interest charges on three IDA loans. The most recent&#13;
tariffs increases were 10% in FY91, 15% in FY93, and another 10% in FY94.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Even these were not adequate to cover DWASA's costs during a time when DWASA's&#13;
its systems losses were about 50%. As a result, DWASA has been unable to keep&#13;
up a full program of regular maintenance and leak detection, leading to a&#13;
further deterioration of its system and services. In addition, DWASA is&#13;
unable to make the relatively modest investments in institutional improvements&#13;
in areas like accounting and billing, collection without the financial support&#13;
of multilateral donors.&#13;
4.          DWASA's Capability:  DWASA's operations suffer from a lack of&#13;
commercial orientation and accountability, poor management systems and&#13;
shortage of trained and motivated staff. Operational performance is weak in&#13;
many respects. The level of system losses was as high as 532 in 1991, and&#13;
accounts receivables arrears average about 6.5 months of billings. Of the&#13;
system losses, it is estimated that 20% is attributable to administrative or&#13;
commercial losses, e.g. under-billing as a result of unmetered service,&#13;
illegal connections and inaccurate and tampered meters, an incomplete customer&#13;
data base, wrong meter reading and rent seeking activities of meter inspectors&#13;
aimed at reduction water bills. Despite revenue improvements DWASA could not&#13;
fully service its interest obligations in recent years, and was in default on&#13;
some covenants for the Second and Third IDA credits.&#13;
5.          Many of these issues have been continuous and pervasive.  In the&#13;
past there has been ad hoc attempts to address them, through DWASA activities&#13;
financed through IDA credits. While this has brought some improvements from&#13;
time to time, the lack of a comprehensive approach to deal with the issues&#13;
have affected the sustainability of the programs. In addition, the lack of an&#13;
effective dialogue between GOB and IDA on the need and the approach to sector&#13;
reforms have affected their implementation. The reforms prepared under this&#13;
project have been formulated after a sustained policy dialogue with the&#13;
Government and represents an attempt to deal with issues affecting DWASA in a&#13;
comprehensive manner.&#13;
THE PROPOSED REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
6.          The proposed objectives of the reform program is to commence a&#13;
process of actions and policy changes that would improve DWASA's institutional&#13;
and financial efficiency and performance to enable it to operate as a more&#13;
autonomous and commercially managed water supply institution. The program&#13;
would seek to:&#13;
(a)   provide DWASA with operating conditions that would approximate&#13;
those of commercial organizations established under the Companies&#13;
Act, and obtain greater autonomy from GOB by strengthening and&#13;
streamlining DWASA's existing Board, revising its Ordinance and&#13;
providing it with operating policies which would define its&#13;
responsibilities as a water utility in areas like staffing,&#13;
financial policy decisions and tariff setting, and those of the&#13;
Government as a share-holder;&#13;
(b)   seek internal changes in DWASA's operations, financial management&#13;
and performance; and&#13;
(c)   establish and enforce management accountability by requiring DWASA&#13;
to meet agreed operational and financial performance targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
7.          The actions required to meet each of these objectives are&#13;
described below:&#13;
(a)   Increase in DWASA Autonomy:  Within the -context of the existing&#13;
regulatory framework, revisions have been made to the WASA&#13;
Ordinance with the objective of establishing DWASA as a commercial&#13;
utility along the lines of utilities in developed countries,&#13;
streamlining its Board membership to seven, the majority of whom&#13;
would be non-government, with renewable fixed tenures. The Board&#13;
would be appointed by the Government, under very clear guidelines&#13;
agreed with IDA. The Ministries of Local Government (MLG) and&#13;
Finance (MOF) would each nominate a Board member to represent the&#13;
Government and DWASA's interests on the Board. The other non-&#13;
governmental members would include a consumer interest group&#13;
representative. The Government would appoint the Chairman of the&#13;
Board from amongst the Board members, also under clear guidelines.&#13;
The Board would select and recruit the Managing Director of DWASA,&#13;
from the private sector with final ratification by the Ministry of&#13;
Local Government, also based on very clear guidelines and&#13;
criteria, agreed with IDA. This Managing Director would be an ex&#13;
officio and non-voting member of the Board.&#13;
To reinforce the separation of responsibilities and DWASA's&#13;
autonomy, a Policy Statement has been agreed that would define the&#13;
Government, Board and Management's role in DWASA's operations. In&#13;
broad terms, the Government's role would be to establish the&#13;
policy framework for the sector and for DWASA; the Board's role&#13;
would be to implement the policy within the framework agreed, and&#13;
the DWASA management's role would be the day-to-day management and&#13;
achievement of agreed operational, financial and institutional&#13;
performance objectives. A system of performance evaluation for&#13;
the Board and management would be established to enable&#13;
supervision and management by results rather than processes, and&#13;
to clarify the perception of managers and GOB about DWASA's&#13;
corporate objectives.&#13;
(b)   Internal changes in DWASA's performance:  To address the problems&#13;
of DWASA's weak capability to provide its services the following&#13;
actions would be taken:&#13;
(i)    establishment of a-Twinning Arrangement with a water&#13;
utility management consultant under technical assistance&#13;
to help DWASA to build managerial, financial and&#13;
technical capabilities essential for efficient management&#13;
and operation of a commercial oriented water utility.&#13;
This technical assistance, renewable every year for four&#13;
years, would seek to improve operations and maintenance,&#13;
management information systems, by implementing a&#13;
modernized and efficient billing and collection system, an&#13;
improved accounting system, technical improvements to&#13;
DWASA to reduce water losses, and training to DWASA staff&#13;
to improve their capabilities to manage the utility;&#13;
(ii)   re-organization of DWASA's structure to create profit/cost&#13;
centers designed to introduce transparency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
accountability into operations, by separating distribution&#13;
and water production and introduction of a transfer price&#13;
between the two units. This would be undertaken by the&#13;
Twinning Program described in (i) above;&#13;
(iii) implementation of a Crash Meter Installation Program to&#13;
reduce unmetered connections to less than 5% within three&#13;
years. This program would be contracted to a private&#13;
sector contractor and would include district/zone metering&#13;
to properly monitor water consumption in different zones&#13;
to set the stage for private participation in DWASA&#13;
activities in future. This program, will utilize&#13;
information from a consumer survey completed in July 1993&#13;
financed under the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project (Cr&#13;
1734-BD), and would commence by Board presentation of the&#13;
project, under a retroactive financing arrangement;&#13;
(iv)   implementation of a Leak Detection and Rehabilitation&#13;
Program throughout DWASA's distribution system to reduce&#13;
physical water losses. This program would utilize a pilot&#13;
program initiated in two consumer zones under the Third&#13;
DWASA Project;&#13;
(v)    contracting out DWASA services to local contractors to&#13;
reduce system losses and improve billing and collection&#13;
efficiency. The services to be contracted out will&#13;
include meter reading, billing, collections, and follow-up&#13;
on payments and disconnection in case of default. The&#13;
program will initially start in two zones and the&#13;
experience in these zones will be used to plan future&#13;
activities; and&#13;
(vi)   implementation of a graduated or block tariff structure to&#13;
properly reflect the cost of providing service and&#13;
discourage excessive water consumption, to be implemented&#13;
gradually over two years. Tariff increases would still be&#13;
required in the interim period to ensure that DWASA&#13;
revenues continue to improve and it achieves financial&#13;
sufficiency within four years. A Tariff Study&#13;
recommending the revised structure was completed during&#13;
preparation.&#13;
(c)   Establishment and enforcement of Management Accountability:  This&#13;
would include actions requiring DWASA to meet agreed operational&#13;
and financial performance objectives, which would be defined in a&#13;
Performance Agreement between the Government and DWASA. The most&#13;
critical of these targets would include:&#13;
(i)    achievement of agreed operating ratios/(revenue/cost)&#13;
levels every year through tariff increases and cost&#13;
reductions to ensure that DWASA covers all costs of&#13;
operations, including debt service charges within four&#13;
years;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
(ii)   reduction in unaccounted-for-water (systems losses) to&#13;
about 30X within seven years;&#13;
(iii) implementation of agreed annual targets of the metering&#13;
program discussed above;&#13;
(iv)   reduction of accounts receivables to agreed levels each&#13;
year (including an initial ageing analysis and writing off&#13;
of uncollectible arrears), with the objective of achieving&#13;
a receivable to billing ratio of 3 months within three&#13;
years; and&#13;
(v)    implementation of an acceptable consumer connection&#13;
program, subject to the availability of water. Targets&#13;
for this will be defined on an annual basis, based on an&#13;
estimate of the availability of water.&#13;
8.          The Performance Agreement will also address issues like reporting&#13;
procedures, the financing of DWASA investments, and performance objective&#13;
follow-up procedures and plans for payment of water supply and sewerage&#13;
arrears from Government departments and public corporations. Some of the&#13;
monitoring indicators to be used to measure DWASA's performance are shown at&#13;
Annex 12. These include physical, technical and financial indicators.&#13;
9.          In addition to these activities, a strategy study would be carried&#13;
out under the project to investigate privatization alternatives, and develop a&#13;
long term strategy for mobilizing finance and increasing efficiency in DWASA.&#13;
The study will assist in demonstrating the need for fundamental reform in&#13;
order to attract required finance from the private sector for DWASA's&#13;
investment program, as well as assess the steps required for reform&#13;
implementation, including the development of a regulatory framework.&#13;

General Operating and Financial Policy Statement&#13;
I.    PREAMBLE&#13;
1.          The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) was&#13;
established under the Water Supply and Sewerage Ordinance of 1963, and amended&#13;
by the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority-(Amendment) Ordinance of 1984.&#13;
DWASA's objectives are to provide for the construction, improvement,&#13;
expansion, operation and maintenance of water supply and sewerage facilities&#13;
in Dhaka.&#13;

Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. In recognizing the important&#13;
role that DWASA plays in the urban development of Dhaka and in meeting basic&#13;
water supply needs, the Government has placed high priority in improving&#13;
DWASA's operational and financial performance. The Government also recognizes&#13;
that DWASA's performance could be improved by providing clearly defined&#13;
guidelines and mandates relative to the organizational, functional, managerial&#13;
and financial aspects of DWASA and the Government's own role in supervision&#13;
and monitoring DWASA's operations.&#13;
3.          The objective of this policy statement is to establish clear&#13;
guidelines for DWASA operations, and provide the required level of autonomy&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
Performance Aareement Between&#13;
The Government of Bangladesh&#13;
and&#13;
Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authoritv&#13;
AGREEMENT&#13;
1.          This Performance Agreement (hereinafter called the Agreement) is&#13;
between the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) represented by the Ministry of&#13;
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRDC) and the Dhaka&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA).&#13;
2.          The rationale for this Agreement arises from the mutual interest&#13;
of both DWASA and GOB to:&#13;
(a)   improve the performance and growth of DWASA as an autonomous&#13;
public utility capable of exercising its powers to maximize the&#13;
benefits from DWASA's assets;&#13;
(b)   to increase the level and quality of water and sanitation services&#13;
in the City of Dhaka;&#13;
(c)   to improve investment and financial planning and reduce the level&#13;
of financial losses in DWASA; and&#13;
(d)   to contribute towards the economic and social development of&#13;
Bangladesh by increasing DWASA's capabilities in the areas of its&#13;
functions as identified by the amended WASA Ordinance of 1963, as&#13;
amended by the WASA (Amendment) Ordinance of 1996.&#13;
3.          Based on this mutual interest, both DWASA and GOB have agreed to&#13;
undertake the obligations set forth in this Agreement toward the fulfillment&#13;
of their respective commitments as described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
4.          GOB and DWASA shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement&#13;
and shall assist each other in the fulfillment of their respective obligations&#13;
as laid down in this Agreement.&#13;
5.          This Performance Agreement shall consist of this Agreement and its&#13;
Annexes, as incorporated herein.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.          The Government recognizes the urgent need for improvement in water&#13;
supply and sanitation in Dhaka and other urban areas in Bangladesh. The main&#13;
sector objective being pursued by the Government is to improve human health&#13;
and productivity through the development of water supply services which are&#13;
affordable and sustainable to as many people as possible.&#13;
7.          In this context, GOB established DWASA under the Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage (WASA) Ordinance of 1963 to formulate, execute, and maintain water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes and impose rates and charges on consumers for&#13;
these services. According to this Ordinance, DWASA is supposed to be an&#13;
autonomous entity; however, the Ordinance also stipulates that DWASA shall be&#13;
guided, on questions of policy, by such directives as the Government may, from&#13;
time to time give, and the Government shall be the sole judge as to whether a&#13;
direction given to DWASA is or is not a question of policy.&#13;
8.          An essential goal for DWASA is to ensure that it operates more&#13;
efficiently as a truly autonomous and commercially managed water supply&#13;
utility by implementing actions that would give it more autonomy in its&#13;
operations to provide its customers with an adequate and reliable water source&#13;
efficiently. To meet the growing demand for water supply in Dhaka, GOB&#13;
support is required to ensure that DWASA achieves this goal. This will&#13;
involve DWASA adopting clear strategies addressing its financial, operational&#13;
and institutional performance.&#13;
9.          The main objective of this Agreement is, therefore, to develop&#13;
DWASA into an efficient and financially autonomous organization, capable of&#13;
meeting consumer needs, without recourse to GOB financial and budgetary&#13;
support. With donor assistance, DWASA is committed to improve the water&#13;
supply and sanitation situation in support of overall Government sector&#13;
objectives.&#13;
10.         The Agreement defines, for the period stipulated:&#13;
(a)   the objectives and obligations of DWASA under the Agreement;&#13;
(b)   the rights and obligations of GOB and DWASA under the Agreement;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   the procedures for performance evaluation and monitoring under the&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
11.         The targets and provisions in this Agreement will be incorporated&#13;
into a Corporate Plan that will form the basis for DWASA's operations and will&#13;
be revised annually.&#13;
GENERAL PROVISIONS&#13;

involved.&#13;

FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Contractinx Out of DWASA Services&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        As part of an efficiency drive, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Authority (DWASA) proposes to "Contract-out", on a trial basis, two of its&#13;
operational activities in two zonal supply areas.   The operations are meter&#13;
reading including installation or replacement and repair of defective consumer&#13;
meters billing and collection.  This approach has become necessary because of&#13;
increasing water and revenue losses due to (i) non-working meters; (ii) absence&#13;
of meter reader incentives and integrity control; (iii) delays in replacing&#13;
defective meters; and (iv) physical and administrative losses in the&#13;
secondary/tertiary distribution system.&#13;
2.        There are some firms in Dhaka with the resources and the understanding&#13;
of the work to be done as envisaged under this contract. Accordingly, offers are&#13;
being invited from these firms for evaluation together with any other companies&#13;
or agencies with experience or knowledge in operating water supply systems and&#13;
billing procedures. Some of the companies in question have already worked with&#13;
DWASA on analyzing system operations and measures to combat losses. However, it&#13;
is intended that this task will generate a degree of competition between bidders&#13;
with a proper understanding of the work to be done and the ability to mobilize&#13;
the resources required. In addition, it has been agreed that one zone would be&#13;
contracted out to DWASA's workers' union along the same terms as those applicable&#13;
to the commercial operators. This will foster competition initially, and both&#13;
contracts would be reviewed after a year, to assess the success of each, and&#13;
provide a basis for renewal, cancellation of either or both contracts.&#13;
Type of Contract:&#13;
3.        The  contracti (or  contracts)  to  be  drawn-up,  would  give  some&#13;
incentive to increase the numbers of meters read and replaced and the level of&#13;
billing and collections.  Additionally, it would include a control element to&#13;
ensure that reliable meter readings are obtained, on which DWASA's customers can&#13;
be billed.   The contract will include a payment schedule for replacing non&#13;
working meters with new or refurbished meters from DWASA Stores and may also&#13;
allow access by the contractor to DWASA's meter repair workshop to carry out&#13;
repairs and recalibrate meters. However, these facilities are limited and the&#13;
contractor may well decide to establish his own repair facilities or make other&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
4.        The contract will be written to encourage the conversion of non-metered&#13;
connections to ones with working meters. Meter removal, repair, recalibration&#13;
and reinstallation will be carried out by the contractor. The contractor will&#13;
also prepare DWASA bills for customers still being charged on the basis of&#13;
1 Outline attached.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
property values.&#13;
5.        The successful bidders would be provided with computer equipment&#13;
purchased by DWASA for use in zonal billing, using the present billing proforma.&#13;
The billing, therefore, would be designed with an interface compatible with&#13;
DWASA's billing computer which is to be incrementally strengthened under the&#13;
project. In this regard, there must be full co-ordination between DWASA and the&#13;
firm that installed DWASA's software.&#13;
6.        As part of the meter reading work and billing process the contractor&#13;
will report system leaks.  The repair of these leaks may be the subject of a&#13;
separate priced contract either with the meter reading contractor or another&#13;
procured by DWASA. Such repairs may also include necessary pipe replacement.&#13;
It is already the practice for DWASA to execute such works as individual small&#13;
scale contracts.&#13;
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
7.        To assess the effectiveness of "contract out program", DWASA will start&#13;
by costing the "in house" part of this operation, in the pilot zones, associated&#13;
with the current stream of revenues. This information will be compared with&#13;
improvements, if any, in metering and billing resulting from the "contracting&#13;
out" process. The trial period will run for not less than 12 months and will be&#13;
extended to two additional zones after the first twelve months. It is expected&#13;
that by FY99, all zones will be covered under the program.&#13;
Timetable for Preparation/Execution by DWASA&#13;
-   Preparation of suitable bid document ---  May 15, 1996&#13;
-   Receipt of expressions interest from ---  June 15, 1996&#13;

METER READING AND REPLACEMENT&#13;
CONTRACT OUTLINE&#13;
The principal items to be included and developed by DWASA into a&#13;
suitable contract bidding document which can be used for engaging a contractor&#13;
to read revenue meters and carry out necessary replacements are given in this&#13;
outline. This work would be carried out on a "trial basis" as an alternative to&#13;
the present "in-house" system where a number of inefficiencies have been&#13;
identified.&#13;
The supply areas to be covered by this proposal would be DWASA's Zone&#13;
4 &amp; 5 containing about 19,000 connections each.  Zone 5 is almost completely&#13;
metered but there is no up-to-date of how many meters are actually working. Zone&#13;
4 is more representative of the undermetering problem and is selected because,&#13;
as well as tackling billing and collection, it will enable the meter coverage to&#13;
be increased significantly.   It is proposed that the entire zones should be&#13;
covered with the possibility of an extension to other areas.&#13;
Contract Information to be Provided by DWASA&#13;
(a) Customers billing record, including postal addresses&#13;
(b) Number of revenue meters and sizes&#13;
(c) Number of unmetered connections and pipe sizes&#13;
(d) The number and sizes of new meters which could be released from&#13;
DWASA's stores&#13;
(e) DWASA Unit Cost for repairing and rehabilitating meters of various&#13;
sizes&#13;
(f) Delivery time for DWASA repaired meters; i.e. in and out of workshop.&#13;
(g) A route walking map of the area covered by the contract&#13;
(h) Detailed   drawing   of  a  meter   box/chamber   installation  and&#13;
specification.&#13;
(i) Meter specification with stated plus and minus accuracy.&#13;
Work Description&#13;
The contract would, as fully as possible, describe the work to be&#13;
carried out.   This calls for reading meters every 2 months, preparing and&#13;
delivering bills and monitoring collections. The contractor who would also be&#13;
responsible for following up defaulters; for this to be done DWASA would keep the&#13;
contractor informed on collection deficiencies.&#13;
At the same time as submitting meter readings the contractor would&#13;
provide the zonal office with a list of unmetered connections recommended for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
conversions.   The contractor would obtain approval for a planned conversion&#13;
program with new meters, available in DWASA stores, or repaired units.   To&#13;
expedite this work the contractor may make his own arrangements for obtaining&#13;
meters that comply with DWASA's own specifications.&#13;
The contractor would undertake the following:&#13;
(i)     for each meter reader collect at least 750 meter readings per&#13;
month;&#13;
(ii)    arrange a cost effective system for delivering bills;&#13;
(iii)   assess meter accuracy in relation to size of buildings/number&#13;
of apartments/occupants and make checks where underbilling is&#13;
suspected due to faulty or tampered meters;&#13;
(iv)    investigate and report illegal connections and by-passes;&#13;
(v)     establish a rolling program for meter testing and replacement;&#13;
(vi)    computerize the consumer record and submit to DWASA's computer&#13;
center every month; and&#13;
(vii)   submit reports on billing,  collection, meter testing and&#13;
repairs.&#13;
Payment Schedule (Bill of Quantities)&#13;
Payment for meter reading preparation and delivery of bills would be&#13;
on a simple unit price based on 6 readings per calendar year for each property.&#13;
Payment would be on a performance basis, i.e. bills delivered and collections&#13;
received by DWASA The billing for un-metered customers would be based on DWASA's&#13;
property value formula.&#13;
Where new meters are installed or replaced a unit price would also&#13;
apply. One price would be for replacement, the other would be for a complete&#13;
installation, including the meter box, if any. A separate unit price would be&#13;
given where the contractor supplied the meter.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
DWASA's zonal supervisors would be responsible for overseeing the&#13;
contract and certifying payments under the contract. Currently, in zone 3 there&#13;
are 4 DWASA meter/connection supervisors and 40 inspectors (meter readers).&#13;
Evaluation of Bids&#13;
DWASA will evaluate bids submitted both on price and the contractors'&#13;
understanding of the work to be done and the contractors' ability to mobilize&#13;
resources. Accordingly, as well as a priced bid, contractors will be asked to&#13;
submit an adequate work plan.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Detailed Description of Proposed Water Treatment Plant&#13;
1.          The proposed treatment plant will include the construction of the&#13;
following subcomponents:&#13;
A.    Pumping Station, Intake Works and Twin Culvert.&#13;
i)    Intake Structure:  The location of the intake structure will be&#13;
about 400 meters down stream of Demra Ghat at Sarulia village.&#13;
A conventional intake with bar racks to provide screening of&#13;
raw water will be constructed off-shore in the river bed. The&#13;
intake will have a capacity of 275 IMGD of water to enter the&#13;
new raw water pumping station. The intake structure is&#13;
designed to operate over a wide variety of river levels so that&#13;
during the wet season, it will not be necessary to pump water&#13;
from the river into the canal.&#13;
ii)   Raw Water Pumping Station:  A raw water pumping station at the&#13;
river front will be constructed to pump water into the DND&#13;
Canal. The pump station will accommodate pumps needed for 125&#13;
IMGD raw water with a provision of another 150 IMGD in future.&#13;
The initial electro-mechanical works will be limited to 60 IMGD&#13;
(50 IMGD for treatment and 10 IMGD for canal logging). Water&#13;
will be pumped in the dry season when the water levels in the&#13;
dry season fall under a certain levels.&#13;
iii) Twin Culvert: Water will be carried from the raw water pumping&#13;
station to the DND canal at Karim Jute Mills by a twin RCC&#13;
culvert with a capacity of 275 IMGD. A control structure&#13;
equipped with penstocks and stop logs will be constructed on&#13;
the culvert to regulate the flow, to clean the culvert i.e. by&#13;
sending the flow in one direction, and to close the flow in&#13;
case of emergency.&#13;
B.    Rehabilitation of the DND Canal.&#13;
The DND canal was built by the Bangladesh Water Development Board&#13;
(BWDB) for irrigation purposes. In March 1993, an agreement was&#13;
signed between BWDB and the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority&#13;
(DWASA) for the joint use of a part of the main canal for the purpose&#13;
of the Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project. DWASA will use the part of&#13;
the canal located from Sarulia to Kajla to convey raw water from the&#13;
Lakhya river to the site of the water treatment plant at Saidabad.&#13;
The length of the canal to be used by DWASA is 4.6 km with an average&#13;
width of about 40 meters. To secure this canal from potential&#13;
pollution and to introduce overflow structures for maintaining the&#13;
canal operation level at 5.00 meters about PWD levels, rehabilitation&#13;
works will be undertaken. This will include: (a) repair of&#13;
embankments on both sides of the canal and removal of trees and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
stand wall with intermediate gullies in turn draining under the road&#13;
to the north; (d) security overflow weirs connected with the existing&#13;
drainage system of the DND irrigation project; (e) an isolating&#13;
embankment (cross dam) at the head of the canal to isolate the&#13;
southern part to be used by BWDB for irrigation purposes; and (f)&#13;
rehabilitation of temporary pedestrian crossings over the canal and&#13;
provision of alternative water supplies (handpumps) to residents who&#13;
currently use the canal for washing.&#13;
C.    Culvert from DND Canal to Treatment Plant Site.  The DND canal&#13;
terminates at a point 1.6 km from the Saidabad Treatment Plant Site.&#13;
To link the canal to the water pumping station within the treatment&#13;
plant site, a second twin box culvert will be constructed with the&#13;
ultimate capacity of 200 IMGD. An intake structure at the canal and&#13;
control structure on the culvert will also be constructed.&#13;
D.    Development of the Treatment Plant Site.  The present site is at&#13;
average ground level of 2-3 meters, and is, in consequence, prone to&#13;
flooding every wet season. To make the site suitable for&#13;
construction, DWASA will require special foundation (piles/rafts) in&#13;
order to construct the works. The site development will raise the&#13;
platform level to 8.00 meters suitable for construction of the plant&#13;
and subsequent operation and maintenance. Backfill will involve&#13;
about 500,000 m3 of earth work, followed by 90Z compaction of&#13;
standard proctor test.&#13;
E.    Saidabad Treatment Plant.  A conventional surface water treatment&#13;
plant with a capacity of 50 mgd will be constructed. The electro-&#13;
mechanical equipment will be manufactured, delivered, installed and&#13;
commissioned under turnkey arrangement, with limited competitive&#13;
bidding. The scope of work for the plant will include:&#13;
i)    Raw water pumping station and distribution arrangements with&#13;
civil works of 200 IMGD capacity, but electro-mechanical and&#13;
equipment limited to 52.5 IMGD;&#13;
ii)   Mixing tanks and flow distribution arrangements;&#13;
Clarifiers and filter batteries;&#13;
iii) Chlorine control tank and-treated water reservoir;&#13;
iv)   Treated water pumping station;&#13;
v)    Main power switchboard and transformer buildings;&#13;
vi)   Chemical storage building, chemical mixing tanks, and&#13;
chlorination building;&#13;
vii) Sludge recovery facilities; and&#13;

iii) Site clearing, fencing, road drainage and site lighting;&#13;
iv)   Pavement of access road after completion of construction activities;&#13;
and&#13;
v)    Provision of gas, electricity and telephone facilities.&#13;
G.    TransmissionlPrimary Distribution Mains.  About 20 km of transmission&#13;
and primary mains will be constructed. The procurement and&#13;
implementation of primary distribution mains will be on a "supply and&#13;
lay" basis. Pipe will be in the diameter range 1,000 mm to 1,500 mm.&#13;
Dual pipelines will be laid along the routes where there is no major&#13;
traffic congestion.&#13;
H.    Secondary Distribution System.   Approximately 18.5 km of secondary&#13;
mains will be constructed. New distribution pipelines, diameter&#13;
range 300 mm to 600 mm will be laid in those areas of the city&#13;
whether new treated water sources will be available to improve the&#13;
local hydraulic capacity for supply to existing and new consumers in&#13;
each sub-zone. In addition, new areas will be supplied with water&#13;
for the first time by DWASA and the new secondary distribution&#13;
pipelines will be laid in each sub-zone.&#13;
2.          Water Treatment Method.  Raw water transmitted to the treatment plant&#13;
would initially receive chemical mixing before passing to the clarifiers. The&#13;
process treatment steps would be chemical injection, rapid mixing, flocculation&#13;
and clarification. Chemicals added at this point would include alum for&#13;
coagulation purposes and chlorine, if necessary, for the control of aquatic&#13;
growths within the clarifiers and filters. From the rapid mixing tanks, water&#13;
would flow to clarification tanks. Clarified water would then flow by gravity to&#13;
the filter influent head channels. Filtered water would flow by gravity into the&#13;
clearwell which would be pumped into the treated water reservoir. The storage&#13;
reservoir is 8% of the plant's rated capacity.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Detailed Description of Institutional Strengthening,&#13;
Loss Reduction and Technical Assistance Components&#13;
1.          Distribution and Production Svstem Rehabilitation&#13;
i)    Leak  Detection  Program:    A  leak  detection  program  will  be&#13;
implemented in the DWASA service area as a follow up to the pilot&#13;
program undertaken in a DWASA zone under the Third DWASA Project&#13;
(Cr.1734-BD. The program will be undertaken in three phases; Phase&#13;
I will revisit the two pilot areas under the Third Project; Phase II&#13;
will cover about 70,000 connections, while the Third Phase will&#13;
cover about 80,000 connections.&#13;
ii) System Rehabilitation: Based on the Leak Detection program in (i)&#13;
above, a program for system rehabilitation for the entire service&#13;
area will be implemented. This program will consist of replacement&#13;
and repair of broken or worn pipes, defective or unsuitable meters&#13;
and fittings, valves, and preparation and implementation of a&#13;
preventive maintenance program for the whole distribution system.&#13;
iii)  Tubewell Regeneration:   A tubewell regeneration program will be&#13;
prepared and implemented to improve the production efficiency of&#13;
DWASA's tubewells. The program will seek to replace or reset wells&#13;
that are non-operative due to sand clogging or whose yields have&#13;
deteriorated.    A  preventive  maintenance  program will  also  be&#13;
prepared and implemented.&#13;
2.          Expansion of Service Connections&#13;
i)    Tertiary Distribution and House Connections:   This will include&#13;
extension of the existing connections to provide water to areas of&#13;
Dhaka that are currently not connected to DWASA services.   About&#13;
50,000 new connections will be installed by the year 2001.&#13;
ii)   Crash Meter Installation Program:  The objective of this program is&#13;
to install meters to connections that are currently not metered, to&#13;
reduce the level of unbilled water and thereby increase revenue.&#13;
The program will reduce unmetered connections from the current 32%&#13;
to 5% within two years. The program will be contracted out to the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
3.          Development of Improved Sanitation/Sewerage Services&#13;
i)    Evaluation Stud_y:  This study will: a) review the existing situation&#13;
to determine the key problems and issues in sanitation and&#13;
collection of waste water and sewerage from domestic, industrial and&#13;
commercial sources in the city; and b) estimate the demand for&#13;
various sanitation options and determine the investment options&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
available, including detailed preparation of priority investments to&#13;
be implemented under the project.&#13;
ii)   Physical Works/Sewerage and Latrines:  Based on the evaluation study&#13;
above, priority investments will be undertaken in rehabilitation of&#13;
selected sections of the sewerage system, and a low cost sanitation&#13;
program to be implemented under the project. The program will also&#13;
provide limited expansion of sewerage services to unserviced areas&#13;
of the city.&#13;
4.          Institutional Development Technical Assistance&#13;
i)    Water Resources Management Study:  The objectives of this two year&#13;
study are to obtain adequate knowledge of the water resources (both&#13;
ground and surface water) in the Dhaka region to facilitate the&#13;
monitoring of quality and quantity of resources and allow effective&#13;
demand management to conserve and utilize available water more&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
ii)   Management and Operations Support (Twinning) Program:  To help DWASA&#13;
improve efficiency, a twinning program from an efficient utility&#13;
will be sought for a period of four and half years. The program&#13;
will address problems and issues in operations and maintenance;&#13;
financial and operational management, personnel management and&#13;
training; management information systems and computerization.&#13;
iii)  Program to Contract Out DWASA Services:   To improve operational&#13;
efficiency, DWASA will commence a program to contract out some of&#13;
its services to local contractors.   The contracts call for the&#13;
reading of meters, preparation of bills, delivery of bills, follow-&#13;
up of defaulters in case of non-payment, meter repair and&#13;
replacements. The program will start in two zones of DWASA service&#13;
area and experience in these zones will be used for planning&#13;
additional contracting services.&#13;
iv)   Training:   Training will be provided to DWASA staff to improve&#13;
skills in financial, operational and technical operation of the&#13;
utility. Training would be based on a manpower and organizational&#13;
study to be undertaken under the Twinning Program. Training will be&#13;
provided on the job, through the DWASA Training Institute, and&#13;
abroad to enable DWASA staff and management gain specific skills&#13;
required  for  utility  operation.    Training  will  also  include&#13;
secondment of DWASA staff to the utility of the twinning partner to&#13;
facilitate appropriate technology transfer.&#13;
v)    Management  Support  (Contract  Staff):        An  experienced  and&#13;
appropriately skilled managing director, and three deputy managing&#13;
directors will be appointed under the project and provided with&#13;
appropriate financial incentives commensurate with their skills. To&#13;
attract staff with necessary skills, these positions will be filled&#13;
by local contract staff, to be initially financed under the project,&#13;
with   the   objective   of   gradually   transferring   financial&#13;
responsibility to DWASA.   The initial contracts will be over a&#13;
period of four years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
vi)   Strateav Study for Private Sector Participation:   To assist in&#13;
developing a long term strategy for mobilizing finance and&#13;
increasing efficiency, DWASA will retain consultants to determine&#13;
the broad levels of finance required, and the sum available from&#13;
different Government concessional and commercial sources. The study&#13;
will assist in demonstrating the need for fundamental reform in&#13;
order to attract the required finance.   It will also assess the&#13;
steps required for reform implementation, including the development&#13;
of a regulatory framework, and will outline the possible contractual&#13;
and financial structure for major private sector participation, for&#13;
example, through a long term concession.   The study findings are&#13;
expected in early 1986. Action taken in response to the study will&#13;
be covered in the mid-term review.&#13;
5.          Prolect Preparation and Implementation Support Technical Assistance&#13;
i)    Project Preparation:  Two consultants to be financed retroactively&#13;
have been appointed to prepare two remaining components of the&#13;
project: a) revision of the WASA Ordinance to create legislation&#13;
that will allow DWASA to operate as a commercial entity; and b)&#13;
detailed design and preparation of bid documents for ancillary&#13;
works.&#13;
ii)   Construction Supervision and Network Analysis:   The project will&#13;
require two construction supervision contracts: a) construction&#13;
supervision of the treatment plant; and b) construction supervision&#13;
of the primary, secondary and tertiary distribution system and the&#13;
intake. The second contract will include a network analysis of the&#13;
distribution system to identify areas of the distribution system&#13;
that need strengthening and extending, using a computer analysis of&#13;
the network (WATNET), with a planning horizon of 2010.&#13;
iii)  Equipment:   Miscellaneous  equipment,  including motor vehicles,&#13;
computers and 50,000 meters will be procured under the project.&#13;
iv)   Implementation  of Tariff  Study:    A  local  consultant will  be&#13;
appointed to help DWASA implement a revised tariff structure based&#13;
on the results of the Tariff Study completed recently by the&#13;
Government.&#13;

Bangladesh&#13;
Fourth Dhaka Water SuPPlY Proiect&#13;
Strategv to Mobilize Finance and Increase Efficiency in the Dhaka Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Sector&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
I     BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides drinking&#13;
water to 3.8 million people in Dhaka  and sewerage services to around 1.14&#13;
million people. It is owned by the Government of Bangladesh, and responsible to&#13;
the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives.&#13;
2.    DWASA is inefficient.  There are high levels of unaccounted for water,&#13;
which have exceeded 50% in recent years. Staff numbers are excessive, at around&#13;
22 staff per thousand connections. Tariffs are high, with residential consumers&#13;
paying Taka 15.84 per 1,000 gallons (equivalent to US$0.09 per cubic meter).&#13;
Industrial and commercial consumers pay much higher levels, and many choose to&#13;
make their own arrangements for water supply. Although DWASA has had access to&#13;
concessional lending and grants, its financial performance has been poor.&#13;
3.    The coverage of drinking water and sewerage is low.  Only 50% of Dhaka's&#13;
population is provided with drinking water, and 15% with water-borne sewerage&#13;
services. Actual numbers are likely to be above this, since some unaccounted for&#13;
water is for illegal connections.&#13;
4.    The proposed Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project will provide drinking water&#13;
to a further 500,000 people, and reduce levels of unaccounted for water.&#13;
However, given the population growth over the period this will still leave major&#13;
investment requirements. Rough estimates of the investment required to provide&#13;
drinking water to all Dhaka's population and sewerage to 60% by 2010 suggest that&#13;
as much as $1.5-2 billion might be required over the next fifteen years.&#13;
II    OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.    A strategy  is required  to raise this  finance,  and to increase the&#13;
efficiency of water and sewerage provision. To date water and sewerage has been&#13;
supplied by a public enterprise drawing heavily on concessional lending.&#13;
However,  the sums now required   greatly exceed the finance available from&#13;
concessional lenders. In its current form DWASA would not have access to this&#13;
scale of finance from commercial sources.&#13;
6.    The objective of the study is to prepare a strategy that will enable the&#13;
Government of Bangladesh to raise the finance required for an accelerated&#13;
investment programme and to increase the efficiency with which investments are&#13;
implemented and operated. In preparing that strategy the consultants should:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
*     agree a set of options to be considered for the future structure of the&#13;
sector, and for responsibilities for investment and operations;&#13;
*     prepare an estimate of investment costs for an accelerated investment&#13;
programme;&#13;
*     amend existing forecasts of operating costs and revenues to be consistent&#13;
with  the  accelerated  investment  programme,  and  with  the  expected&#13;
efficiency of operations under different options; and&#13;
*     review the scale of funds available from different sources and the terms&#13;
attached to them, to determine the feasibility and cost of financing the&#13;
accelerated investment programme under different options.&#13;
7.    The objective of the study is to assist the Government of Bangladesh in&#13;
understanding, and selecting between, options for financing and managing future&#13;
water and sewerage provision. The consultants will be required to work closely&#13;
with Government throughout ths- study.  A Steering Committee will be convened by&#13;
Government to guide the consultants, and to monitor and respond to the key&#13;
deliverables described below. The consultants will arrange for key officials to&#13;
have exposure to private sector operators, and to visit cities where greater&#13;
private sector participation is being introduced in the water sector.&#13;
II    SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
Overall approach&#13;
8.    The consultants should review a broad range of options for ownership,&#13;
operation and industry  structure.   These  should include  continued public&#13;
enterprise reform, and differing forms of private sector participation.   The&#13;
profitability of DWASA (or any successor body), and its access to the required&#13;
finance should be estimated for each option. Options which are not capable of&#13;
raising the required finance should be rejected, but should be included in the&#13;
report with detailed anaysis.&#13;
9.    There are likely to be a number of different options under which DWASA&#13;
would be capable of financing the proposed increase in service provision. The&#13;
costs associated with these options should be modelled. The final tariff impact&#13;
should be assessed for different options, as well as the transitional costs (such&#13;
as demanning) associated with them.   The consultants should also review the&#13;
regulatory and legal requirements associated with each option.&#13;
10.   Detailed analysis should be presented for each option capable of financing&#13;
the required expansion.   The consultants should also indicate the preferred&#13;
option.&#13;
Options for-consideration&#13;
11.   The consultants should prepare options for ownership of the assets,&#13;
responsibility for operation and industry structure. These should include one&#13;
or more options for public enterprise reform from continued public ownership with&#13;
differing forms of private sector participation up to full privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
12.   The option for continued public enterprise reform would continue DWASA's&#13;
ownership and operation responsibility.   However, it should incorporate the&#13;
institutional changes agreed in preparation of the Fourth Dhaka Water Supply&#13;
project. These include steps to organise DWASA along more commercial lines;&#13;
creation of internal profit centres; contracting out of billing, collections and&#13;
meter repair; and support through a twinning programme, training and other&#13;
technical--assistance.&#13;
13.   The consultants will need to form a realistic and soundly based assessment&#13;
of the likely impact of these reforms on DWASA's efficiency, profitability and&#13;
access to finance. This will require an understanding of the success of such&#13;
reform measures elsewhere, and in particular in other sectors in Bangladesh.&#13;
14.   The consultants  should also review possible forms of private sector&#13;
participation. These should include:&#13;
*     further contracting out of specified services, in addition to that already&#13;
proposed, or modification to existing contracts;&#13;
*     contracting out of new investment through BOO or BOT financing;&#13;
*     a management contract;&#13;
*     private sector responsibility for operations, including working capital,&#13;
combined with public sector responsibility for major investments;&#13;
*   _ a long term concession,  with private  sector responsibility  for all&#13;
investments over the life of the concession; and&#13;
*     privatization.&#13;
15.   The consultants should cover the options described above.  However, they&#13;
can also propose alternative forms of private sector participation or public&#13;
enterprise reform for inclusion within the study.&#13;
16.   At present DWASA is an integrated utility.  The consultants should consider&#13;
the scope for vertical or horizontal separation, where this would provide greater&#13;
transparency in operational performance and stronger incentives for efficiency.&#13;
However, the dominant objective is to assist in the mobilization of finance.&#13;
Where unbundling would increase risk to an unacceptable degree and so hinder&#13;
financing this should be stated.&#13;
17.   The deliverables from this work will be a set of options for detailed&#13;
consideration. The development of these options will be reviewed and commented&#13;
upon by the Steering Committee.&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
18.   Financial projections have been made in preparation for the Fourth Water&#13;
Supply project. These financial projections will need to be updated. They will&#13;
also need to be amended to allow for achievable efficiency gains and increased&#13;
financing requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
19.   The financial projections should be prepared to allow for fully meeting the&#13;
demand for water and meeting the 60% of the demand for sewerage.  Costs and&#13;
revenues should be projected for meeting this level of coverage by 2010 and 2020.&#13;
Demand forecasts should be based on those prepared by BCEOM, but DWASA's views&#13;
should also be taken into consideration.&#13;
Operating costs&#13;
20.   DWASA incurs very high electricity costs for water pumping, and these&#13;
account for 60X of operating costs.  Direct wages and salaries account for a&#13;
further 15%. Repairs and maintenance account for only 6% of direct expenses, and&#13;
this inadequate funding is leading to deterioration of the network.   The&#13;
consultants should assess operating costs; determine what these might be&#13;
following implementation of the proposed reforms to DWASA; and determine how&#13;
operating costs might change as service provision increases.&#13;
21.   The Fourth Water Supply project will achieve significant changes in DWASA's&#13;
status and structure, strengthen DWASA's management, and provide technical&#13;
assistance to increase management capability and DWASA's efficiency. It will be&#13;
important to have a realistic view of what efficiency gains can be achieved&#13;
through public enterprise reform in the operating environment faced by DWASA, and&#13;
to incorporate these in the revised financial projections.   The consultants&#13;
should review the reform experience of other utilities in Bangladesh, and draw&#13;
on experience of water utility reform in other developing countries, in&#13;
particular South and South/East Asia.&#13;
22.   Significant private sector participation is likely to change fixed and&#13;
variable operating costs.   The consultants should prepare estimates of what&#13;
further changes in operating efficiency could be achieved under different&#13;
options. Where significant transitional costs are incurred these should be&#13;
incorporated in the analysis. For example, it is possible that a private sector&#13;
operator would achieve greater reductions in fixed labour costs, but would incur&#13;
a transitional cost for redundancy payments/redeployment.&#13;
Investment costs&#13;
23.   Investment needs to 2020 have already been assessed in a study carried out&#13;
by BCEOM. The consultants should review this work, and prepare outline estimates&#13;
of the costs of an accelerated investment programme. Two accelerated programmes&#13;
should be prepared, to allow for 100% drinking water provision and 60% provision&#13;
of water-borne sewerage by 2010 and by 2020.&#13;
24.   It is not envisaged that the study recommendations will be sensitive to the&#13;
level of investment costs, and if necessary the financial analysis can be amended&#13;
at a later date once the findings of other studies emerge (such as the&#13;
Feasibility Study for Improved Sanitation Services). Cost estimates should only&#13;
be approximate. Where possible they should be based on the BCEOM study. Where&#13;
new investment costs need to be estimated, these should be based on simple unit&#13;
cost estimates.&#13;
25.   The scale of investment required will vary according to the efficiency of&#13;
operations. Investment costs should be adjusted to allow for the variations in&#13;
operating efficiency discussed above, and in particular the variations in levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
of unaccounted for water.&#13;
Costs of Capital&#13;
26.   Over recent years, DWASA has made a net loss.  However, it has had access&#13;
to low cost capital from bilateral and multilateral sources. Capital investments&#13;
have been financed through substantial levels of grant, and through foreign&#13;
exchange loans with 25 years repayment, 5 years grace, and interest rates ranging&#13;
from 3-12.5Z. The consultants should review DWASA's financing costs over recent&#13;
years to determine the historic costs of capital.&#13;
27.   The financial projections should allow for the expected future costs of&#13;
capital.   Under the public enterprise reform option,  possible  sources of&#13;
financing will include:&#13;
*     a higher level of self-financing, due to greater profitability;&#13;
*     continued concessional lending.   The consultants should review the scale&#13;
of funds and the likely terms for future concessional lending from the&#13;
IBRD, ADB and bilateral concessional sources. Discussion with the Ministry&#13;
of Finance will be required to assess the on-lending terms to be attached&#13;
to any finance from concessional sources;&#13;
*     Government grants or loans.   The consultants  should agree with the&#13;
Ministry of Finance the scale of funds and terms for Government finance;&#13;
and&#13;
*     lending from commercial sources.  The consultants should review the scale&#13;
and terms of commercial lending to DWASA under credible public enterprise&#13;
reforms.&#13;
28.   The expected return on equity and costs of debt for private sector&#13;
participation in major investments, through BOO/BOT financing or a long term&#13;
concession, should be assessed to determine the cost of capital associated with&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;
29.   The consultants should determine the possible scale and cost of private&#13;
sector finance-through discussion with possible operators and review of private&#13;
sector participation elsewhere in Asia. The level of risk which the private&#13;
sector is willing to accept should be assessed and conclusions drawn on the&#13;
requirements for guarantees against specific risks.&#13;
Revenues&#13;
30.   Revisions to the tariff structure and levels have been agreed during the&#13;
preparation of the Fourth Water Supply project. The consultants should prepare&#13;
revenue projections associated with the accelerated investment programme,&#13;
allowing for any variations in estimated commercial performance and collection&#13;
under different options.&#13;
31.   This analysis should be used to prepare revised financial forecasts for&#13;
DWASA. These forecasts would be used to assess the feasibility and cost of&#13;
financing accelerated investment under different scenarios for public enterprise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
reform and private sector participation; the effect of achievable efficiency&#13;
gains; and the impact on tariffs.&#13;
32.   The deliverables from this work would be a set of outline financial&#13;
forecasts associated with each of the options described above. These forecasts&#13;
would be presented to the Steering Committee and amended in the light of comments&#13;
received.&#13;
Preferred option&#13;
33.   The analysis described above would start with a wide range of options.  It&#13;
is expected that some of these options would not be capable of raising the&#13;
required finance, or could only do so at  a very high cost of capital.  The&#13;
consultants would reject these options/giving justification for such rejection.&#13;
34. Options that enabled the required finance to be raised would be examined in&#13;
greater detail.&#13;
35.   For options with greater private sector participation the consultants&#13;
should describe:&#13;
*     the proposed contractual structure; and&#13;
*     the allocation of risk between the parties, including any guarantors.&#13;
36.   Greater private sector participation will require development of an&#13;
appropriate legal framework and of regulation. For each option the consultants&#13;
should propose an appropriate form of regulation.    Where this requires an&#13;
autonomous regulatory body, the consultant should describe the scope of work of&#13;
the regulatory body, its legislative underpinning, its financing, and ways in&#13;
which regulatory autonomy can be ensured.&#13;
37.   For each feasible alternative, the consultants will assess the step6&#13;
required for implementation. Any requirements for legislative change would be&#13;
described. A timetable for implementation of each feasible option should be&#13;
given.&#13;
38.   The consultants should assess the political and other costs associated with&#13;
greater private sector participation. This will include the possible impact on&#13;
employment and tariffs.&#13;
39.   Where there is likely to be substantial demanning, they should propose&#13;
solutions that would make the social cost acceptable, and they should assess the&#13;
costs of redundancy payments or other interventions.&#13;
40.  Where tariff increases are required, the consultants should assess the&#13;
social impact. If tariff increases have an unacceptable impact on low-income&#13;
groups, offsetting measures should be proposed and costed.&#13;
41.   The consultants should clearly and concisely summarise the feasibility of&#13;
financing an accelerated investment programme under different forms of public&#13;
enterprise reform and private sector participation. The consultant should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
recommend the option which meets the objectives of heightened efficiency and&#13;
resource mobilisation most effectively. The main selection criteria should be&#13;
the impact on consumer tariffs. However, the consultants should also propose&#13;
alternative selection criteria (such as ease of implementation) if appropriate.&#13;
42.   The deliverables from this work will be detailed analysis of feasible&#13;
options, a recommended option for mobilising finance and a timetable for&#13;
Implementation. This will form the basis of a policy dialogue between the World&#13;
Bank and the Government of Bangladesh on the way forward.&#13;
Capacity buildina&#13;
43.   The purpose of this study is to assist the Government of Bangladesh in&#13;
providing drinking water and sewerage services.  It is likely that this will&#13;
require a higher degree of private sector participation.   A key element of&#13;
success will therefore be the ability to develop an understanding of the&#13;
rationale for private sector participation, and the different forms of private&#13;
participation open to Bangladesh.&#13;
44.   The consultants should work closely with officials of DWASA, the Ministry&#13;
of Local Government and the Ministry of Finance throughout the study.   In&#13;
addition, the study should allow for visits by key Government and utility&#13;
officials to developing countries that are successfully developing greater&#13;
private sector participation, as well as exposure to possible private sector&#13;
operators.&#13;
45.   The deliverables from this work will be a deeper understanding of the&#13;
reasons for and process of private sector participation in the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
III   Study Organisation and Inputs&#13;
46.   The study will address fundamental issues in the approach to financing&#13;
infrastructure provision in Bangladesh. It may recommend major policy shifts.&#13;
A Steering Committee will be convened to ensure that the study effectively&#13;
responds to the concerns of the Government of Bangladesh. The Steering Committee&#13;
will include representatives from the Ministry of Local Government, Rural&#13;
Development and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Relations&#13;
Department. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary for Local&#13;
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives.&#13;
47.   DWASA will be work closely with the study team.  Two counterparts within&#13;
DWASA will be nominated to work with the study team on cost analysis and&#13;
preparation of the financial forecasts.&#13;
48.   DWASA will provide the consultants with access to all available data and&#13;
internal documents. DWASA will also arrange access to facilities as required,&#13;
and to key officials within government.   Office space,  telephone and fax&#13;
facilities will be provided at DWASA's office.&#13;
49.   The study will be undertaken over an elapsed time of five months.&#13;
Reporting requirements will be as shown below.&#13;

PROPOSED FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Feasibility Study for Improved Sanitation Services&#13;
Draft Outline Terms of Reference&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        The Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project includes a technical assistance&#13;
component for the preparation of a comprehensive plan to address the sanitation&#13;
and sewerage problems of the city. It also includes financial resources for the&#13;
implementation of a modest sanitation/sewerage component to be identified as the&#13;
first stage of a longer term program for which future funding will be sought.&#13;
2.        The study will be conducted in  two parts:  (i)  a comprehensive&#13;
evaluation of the current problem including a projection of demand covering the&#13;
period 1995-2010; and (ii) the identification of an agreed component for which&#13;
detailed design and bidding documents will be prepared.&#13;
II. BACKGROUND&#13;
3.        The Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project has institutional and physical&#13;
investment components.   The institutional component is aimed at reforms that&#13;
would enable Dhaka WASA to operate more efficiently. The physical component is&#13;
intended to augment the water supply by about 50 IMGD1 as the first phase of a&#13;
development program aimed at increasing Dhaka's water supply by about 250 IMGD&#13;
over a period of 20 years.   Up to now, the water supply of Dhaka has been&#13;
obtained mainly from deep tube wells distributed over the city. The proposed&#13;
project would change this; in addition to the existing multi-point ground water&#13;
supply system, the project envisages a surface water intake structure, together&#13;
with a new treatment plant with associated transmission lines and civil works.&#13;
4.        The change from a multi-point ground water supply system to a single&#13;
point surface water source could have implications for the distribution system&#13;
sizes and pressures; it would also have a number of possible environmental&#13;
impacts. Augmentation of the supply would result in the generation of additional&#13;
waste water flow and inadequate disposal of the additional wastewater may create&#13;
a risk of pollution of ground and surface water sources. One of the technical&#13;
options for addressing this problem may be to use a combined sewerage system for&#13;
the  collection  and  disposal  of  sewage  and  storm water.    However,  the&#13;
1 IMGD equals one million imperial gallons per day.  It is equivalent&#13;
to 4.546 MI/d or 4,546 m'/d.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
effectiveness of the solid waste collection and disposal system might affect the&#13;
efficacy and sustainability of such a solution; therefore, the sanitation study&#13;
should also include an assessment of the adequacy of solid waste and storm&#13;
drainage services in Dhaka to determine the reciprocal impact of these elements.&#13;
5.        A variety of sanitation2 technologies are used in the city.   An&#13;
estimated 15 percent of the population is served through conventional sewerage;&#13;
about 30 percent use septic tanks; others use pit latrines, pour flush toilets,&#13;
or no formal sanitation facilities. The first sewerage system for Dhaka dates&#13;
back to 1923. Since then there has been a number of expansions to the system to&#13;
cope with the growing population.   The existing sewerage system covers the&#13;
central developed area of Dhaka. It comprises three trunk interceptor sewers,&#13;
one central pumping station, 12 small lift stations, and one sewage treatment&#13;
plant at Pagla. The system is now aged and deteriorated and portions have become&#13;
broken or clogged.&#13;
6.        A number of studies have been undertaken to identify remedial measures;&#13;
these will be reviewed and used as source material in preparing this study. The&#13;
latest were completed in February of 1990 by Messrs CDM and McDonald &amp; Partners.&#13;
Under a recent grant from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA),&#13;
the sewage treatment plant at Pagla which had become overloaded has been&#13;
rehabilitated and upgraded; in addition, inoperative pumping and lift stations&#13;
have been rehabilitated. There has also been some extension and upgrading of&#13;
parts of the system under the Third Dhaka Water Supply Project funded through an&#13;
IDA Credit (Credit 1734-BD). However, no comprehensive city-wide evaluation of&#13;
the hydraulic and structural condition of the sewerage system has been&#13;
undertaken. The need for such an evaluation has become even more pressing as a&#13;
result of population growth, the expanding geographical size of the Dhaka WASA&#13;
area, and the impact of the additional water production soon to be provided.&#13;
7.        On the institutional side, the primary agencies with responsibility for&#13;
this component are the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA), and the&#13;
Dhaka City Corporation (DCC). DWASA was established in 1963 as a semi-autonomous&#13;
authority for the provision of water supply and sanitation services for the City&#13;
of Dhaka. It is responsible for sewerage and drainage. Services that entail the&#13;
use of low-cost and on-site sanitation systems are the responsibility of DCC&#13;
where a low-cost sanitation unit has recently been established. The DCC is also&#13;
responsible for solid waste disposal.&#13;
8.        DWASA and DCC come under the Local Government Division (LGD) of the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives.   The LGD&#13;
regulates the activities of DWASA and DCC; it reviews their project proposals,&#13;
2    The term "sanitation" is defined here as a service:  (a) for the&#13;
collection and disposal of excreta and wastewater from domestic, commercial and&#13;
industrial sources and (b) for the abatement of environmental pollution from such&#13;
wastes. The provision of this service entails the construction, operation and&#13;
maintenance of a range of physical infrastructure, such as conventional sewerage,&#13;
intermediate sewerage and various types of on-site sanitation systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
and monitors their performance in project implementation. Matters relating to&#13;
the environment are the responsibility of the Department of Environment (DOE).&#13;
III. SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
PART l&#13;
9.        In carrying out this part of the study the consultant will be given&#13;
access by DWASA to all previous studies and be provided with such relevant&#13;
information it has at its disposal. The output expected is a prioritized series&#13;
of project components aimed at solving the most critical identified sanitation/&#13;
sewerage problems of Dhaka.&#13;
10.       The output will be in the form of reports, diagrams and maps and also&#13;
consist of an Executive Summary.&#13;
11.       During the preparation of this part of the study the consultant will&#13;
liaise with DWASA (and any other concerned agencies), at regular intervals, to&#13;
report interim findings and conclusions to ensure that the final recommendations&#13;
identify a costed acceptable sanitation/sewerage component that can be&#13;
implemented under the Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project.&#13;
12.       In the following  summary suggested activities  have been grouped&#13;
together for reasons of clarity, but the Consultant shall ensure full cross-&#13;
referencing between the tasks described.&#13;
Review of Existing Situation&#13;
13.       A review of the existing situation is required for defining the key&#13;
problems and issues in the collection and disposal of exereta and liquid wastes&#13;
from domestic, industrial and commercial sources in the city. The review is also&#13;
required to enable the Consultant to identify and estimate the costs of feasible&#13;
technical measures to address these issues.   To this end, the task of the&#13;
Consultants shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the review&#13;
of:&#13;
(a) previous studies carried out during the past 15 years in sanitation&#13;
services for Dhaka, including recently completed and on-going&#13;
projects;&#13;
(b) trends in demographic and housing patterns, and in industrial and&#13;
commercial development patterns;&#13;
(c) existing status and future plans for water supply, sanitation,&#13;
industrial and solid waste management, and storm water drainage;&#13;
(d) the extent, hydraulic capacity, structural condition, and technical&#13;
performance of existing sewerage systems in Dhaka;&#13;
(e) existing service levels and deficiencies in sanitation coverage and&#13;
operational performance in different parts of the city and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
different income groups;&#13;
(f) neighborhood    environmental    conditions,    and    city-wide&#13;
environmental/water quality conditions, including the extent and risk&#13;
of pollution of surface and ground water resources;&#13;
(g) financing and cost-recovery policies and achievements;&#13;
(h) policy and institutional framework for service provision, including&#13;
the share of public and private sector involvement in sanitation&#13;
service provision, and the legal and regulatory framework for service&#13;
provision;&#13;
(i) existing informal organizations in the city (NGOs, voluntary service&#13;
organizations and community-based organizations) -- the roles they&#13;
have played in the past, and the potential roles they can play in the&#13;
provision of improved waste management services; and&#13;
(j) water quality standards and pollution control regulations.&#13;
14.       Based on this review and on their own investigations, the Consultants&#13;
shall prepare a report on existing conditions. The report shall include, but&#13;
shall not necessarily be limited to the following:&#13;
(a) summary of existing conditions with respect to: (i) coverage and&#13;
deficiencies in services at zonal or neighborhood level, (ii)&#13;
neighborhood or zonal level environmental quality conditions, and&#13;
(iii) the wider environmental/water quality conditions;&#13;
(b) existing cost-recovery policies and mechanisms for sewerage and&#13;
sanitation services, and the ratio of revenues to investment costs in&#13;
sewerage and sanitation services;&#13;
(c) issues   constraining   sector   development   in   the   past,   and&#13;
recommendations for addressing these issues;&#13;
(d) informal organizations in Dhaka City, their past and potential future&#13;
roles in waste management;&#13;
(e) feasible solutions to the problems identified in each of the three&#13;
sub-sectors of waste management; and&#13;
(f) cost estimates for each feasible technical solution, calculated on a&#13;
zonal or neighborhood basis, or on such other basis as the Consultants&#13;
deem appropriate.&#13;
Demand Estimation and Choice of Investment Options&#13;
15.       A  demand  estimation  is  required  to establish  a basis  for  the&#13;
Consultants to elicit from households which types of investments they preferred&#13;
and willingness to pay. This information would then be used, along with other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
information, to help make choices from options in technologies cost-&#13;
recovery/financing arrangements.&#13;
16.       To this end, the Consultant shall perform, but shall not necessarily&#13;
be limited to the following tasks:&#13;
(a) household willingness-to-pay studies, using a sampling method which&#13;
permits investment decisions to be made on a zonal or neighborhood&#13;
basis; this should include an assessment of household knowledge,&#13;
attitudes and practices with regard to sanitation, solid waste and&#13;
storm drainage services;&#13;
(b) community-level dialogue -- where appropriate -- to discuss and&#13;
confirm demand; ascertain extent of in-kind contributions, if any; and&#13;
identify additional measures communities would be willing to undertake&#13;
to ensure effective cost-recovery, and sustainability of the flow of&#13;
benefits from proposed investments;&#13;
(c) matching the willingness-to-pay with each of the sub-sectors in waste&#13;
management, and with the technological options within sub-sectors;&#13;
(d) rank ordering the different sub-sectors and the technological options&#13;
within sub-sectors, using the following performance criteria:&#13;
(i) cost-recovery per unit cost of investment;&#13;
(ii) coverage per unit investment cost;&#13;
(iii) benefits per unit cost of investment; and&#13;
(iv) analyzing the trade-offs between the different criteria.&#13;
17.       The relevant revenues that should be used in ratio of cost-recovery per&#13;
unit investment cost are (a) direct user charges (estimated on the basis of the&#13;
demand information) and (b) local government levies on the beneficiaries of the&#13;
investments.  This is consistent with the general principle of cost-recovery&#13;
which states that local and regional residents should finance, through user&#13;
charges or locally borne taxes, the costs of designing, building, operating, and&#13;
maintaining facilities to the extent that they receive the benefits.&#13;
18.       Based on the tasks identified in paragraph 16 and on the Consultant's&#13;
own investigations, the Consultant shall make recommendations on:&#13;
(a) where there should be investments in sanitation infrastructure under&#13;
the Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project;&#13;
(b) how the sanitation investments should be prioritized within the city:&#13;
and&#13;
(c) what should be the choice of technological facilities in different&#13;
locations in the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
Choice of Investment Options&#13;
19.       On the basis of these tasks and on own investigations, the Consultant&#13;
should prepare a demand-based sustainable sanitation plan for implementation in&#13;
the city during the period 1995-2010 in three 5-year periods, and based thereon,&#13;
identify priority investments for implementation during the Fourth Dhaka Water&#13;
Supply Project.&#13;
20.       The plan should be prepared at feasibility level.  It should include&#13;
a clear definition of the criteria used for investment decisions and for the&#13;
prioritization of investments in different parts of the city. It should identify&#13;
the pressing problems facing the city in the sanitation sub-sector, the&#13;
investment choices for addressing the problems, and the justification for the&#13;
Consultant's recommendations.  It should make recommendations for financing and&#13;
cost-recovery arrangements to ensure financial sustainability of proposed&#13;
investments. In addition, it should include institutional arrangements necessary&#13;
to ensure that the expected flow of benefits can be sustained over the useful&#13;
life of the physical infrastructure to be built. The proposed plan should be&#13;
sufficiently flexible and adaptive.&#13;
PART 2&#13;
21.       Based on an agreed project component, identified in the overall study&#13;
in Part 1, the consultant will prepare detailed engineering drawings and bid&#13;
documents for works to be executed in accordance with Local Competitive Bidding&#13;
(LCB) procedures approved by the World Bank.&#13;
22.       The specifications for the work to be executed will be in accordance&#13;
with best engineering practice and take into account local contractor competence.&#13;
Time Schedule and Reporting Requirements&#13;
23.       The consultants shall mobilize their team in Dhaka within one week of&#13;
the starting date. They should provide a core team of professionals, local and&#13;
expatriate, as appropriate, for the assignment. In performing their duties, the&#13;
consultants shall prepare reports in English and submit them to DWASA and IDA&#13;
within the time periods specified in Table 1 below, and in the number of copies&#13;
specified therein.&#13;
IV.  DATA, SERVICE.S AND FACILITIES AVAILABLE FROM DWASA&#13;
A.    Data, Maps and References&#13;
24.       DWASA shall provide the Consultants with access to all available data,&#13;
information maps, drawings and internal documents relevant to the consulting&#13;
services. All reference materials will be loaned to the Consultants and shall&#13;
be returned on the completion of the consultancy, or as may be requested.&#13;
Exceptions to this principle may be granted on special request.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Dhaka Water Resource Management Study&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The city of Dhaka is seriously short of safe domestic water; about 50&#13;
percent of the population is served by the city's domestic water supply system&#13;
which is operated by the Dhaka Water and Sewage Authority (DWASA). Ninety-&#13;
five percent of the total amount of the supplied water has always come from&#13;
ground water, which is less expensive and hygienically safer compared to&#13;
surface water. Due to the limited availability of ground water, particularly&#13;
in the most densely populated area of Dhaka, surface water is now being&#13;
considered as an alternative source for domestic water supply.&#13;
2.    The total amount of ground water abstraction by private and DWASA tube&#13;
wells is estimated to be 274 x 106 M3 per year, of which DWASA is responsible&#13;
for about 81 percent of the total or about 223 x 10 6M per year of water as&#13;
of 1992. At this rate of abstraction, despite favorable natural recharge, it&#13;
has experienced a drawdown "cone" to develop, with a maximum fall in&#13;
piezometric level of over 20 meters.&#13;
3.    Under the proposed project, Dhaka is seeking the use of surface water to&#13;
satisfy the city's ever-growing demand of water supply and to alleviate&#13;
existing excessive burden on the ground water source. The beneficiary of the&#13;
project will mainly be people of the old part of the City.&#13;
4.    The proposed project will provide additional water to alleviate, to a&#13;
certain extent, the existing drinking water shortage problem of Dhaka. Due to&#13;
competing use of water of the various sectors and the ever growing problem of&#13;
pollution from both domestic and industrial sources a water resource&#13;
management study addressing both the water quantity and water quality issues&#13;
is needed in order to guide the future of water resource management and&#13;
development for Dhaka.&#13;
5.    The primary targets of the Water Resource Management Study (WRMS), are&#13;
among other things: (i) to recover the ground water level in the affected&#13;
areas, and (ii) to protect the new surface water intake point from competing&#13;
users and pollution. The scope of the WRMS should include the greater Dhaka&#13;
area as the city is expanding rapidly although the affected area is centered&#13;
at Dhaka city proper. This is also required for the protection of the Demra&#13;
intake point on the Lakhya River.&#13;
6.    Urban environmental sanitation and domestic waste management is&#13;
generally an integral part of most of the WRMS. Under the proposed project&#13;
already there is a technical assistance component for a strategic sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
plan for Dhaka for the period 1995-2020 to address sanitation and sewerage&#13;
problems in Dhaka. It is critical that the two studies be well coordinated.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
7.    The WRMS will try to address the questions of water resources&#13;
management, competing sector uses, and quality and quantity of sources,&#13;
including allocation and pricing. The specific objectives of the study will&#13;
include, but not necessarily be limited to:&#13;
a.    documenting the existing urban/industrial development and the&#13;
future development plan of the Greater Dhaka and the project-&#13;
related areas;&#13;
b.    documenting the existing water resources abstraction information,&#13;
including surface water and ground water, and project future water&#13;
demand and abstraction plan;&#13;
c.    documenting existing environmental water pollution problems,&#13;
including domestic and industrial sources, and project future&#13;
pollution problems;&#13;
d.    addressing the principal issues of water resource development&#13;
including the control of water (flood control, storm water&#13;
drainage, sewerage conveyance); the use of water (municipal,&#13;
industrial, irrigation and navigation); and the management of&#13;
water quality (pollution control);&#13;
e.    assessment of the ways to manage water demand between competing&#13;
users, including water allocation and pricing for irrigation,&#13;
domestic and industrial uses;&#13;
f.    establishment of water rights and improvement of delivery&#13;
efficiency (quantity and timing) and effective water use&#13;
participation;&#13;
g.    co-ordination and control of  water abstraction from both ground&#13;
and surface water sources to maximize available water resources;&#13;
h.    preparation of measures for improved water quality/quantity&#13;
management and urban/industrial drainage control, including&#13;
municipal and industrial waste abatement;&#13;
i.    implementation of institutional and organizational arrangements&#13;
for better coordination of water users and agencies managing and&#13;
allocating water; and&#13;
j.    implementation of legislation for developing and managing water&#13;
resources, including pollution control and water rights&#13;
regulations.&#13;

Approach&#13;
8.    Quite often in the developing countries environmental protection gets&#13;
more publicity than real problems solved primarily due to lack of financial&#13;
resources. Financial assistance acquired from abroad only represents a very&#13;
small fraction of the actual needs of the country. The real need of financial&#13;
resource for environmental protection is significant. Foreign assistance must&#13;
be used in the most prudent manner in order to maximize benefit. Project&#13;
success must be measured by the project component's viability or&#13;
sustainability whether it is institutional or hardware investment. For the&#13;
WRMS to maximize its benefit, it is important that its design observes certain&#13;
guidelines, as follows:&#13;
a.    close coordination with other related local and international&#13;
studies, such as ongoing works by ADB, JICA;&#13;
b.    integration into the other components of the project particularly&#13;
the sanitation strategy planning under the technical assistance&#13;
component;&#13;
C.    building on the existing institutional capability rather than&#13;
creating new ones;&#13;
d.    recommendations for actions should be in line with existing&#13;
regulations and standards;&#13;
e.    adopting as much assistance-oriented measures as possible rather&#13;
than the command-and-control means in achieving environmental&#13;
objectives, particularly for industrial pollution control; and&#13;
f.    adequate resource for the WRMS must be made available for the&#13;
implementation of certain key components that can create tangible&#13;
results.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
Part I:     Institutional Strengthening&#13;
9.    The ambient environmental quality standards and the standard values for&#13;
industrial effluent were drafted by the Department of Environment in 1991;&#13;
however, there are no rules and procedures directing the implementation. In&#13;
the previous studies it was indicated that present water and environmental&#13;
related institutions are weak and their coordination unstructured without&#13;
specific details. The study should be able to identify certain basic&#13;
institutional issues that can be studied at the beginning, and more issues are&#13;
to be identified and studied as the WRMS is in progress. The study will&#13;
include:&#13;
a.    comprehensive assessment of the capacity of existing water&#13;
resource management-related institutions including staffing,&#13;
facilities, management tools, database, previous performance,&#13;
ongoing program and any future development plans;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
b.    identification/initiation of an institutional coordination plan,&#13;
including both local and donor agencies, to bring water resources&#13;
management of Dhaka under an umbrella organization;&#13;
c.    identification of the respective roles of the local agencies under&#13;
the umbrella organization for the WRMS;&#13;
d.    identification of major areas of capacity building needed for the&#13;
local agencies under the umbrella organization;&#13;
e.    formulation of training programs;&#13;
f.    providing assistance in drafting the necessary rules and&#13;
procedures to supplement for the draft environmental legislation&#13;
of 1994 and for the implementation of the ambient water quality&#13;
standards and industrial effluent standards;&#13;
g.    estimation of resources needed for the various activities of&#13;
capacity building, and&#13;
h.    formulation of implementation approach, program and time table.&#13;
Part II:    Water Resources Management&#13;
10.   It is expected that the results of the institutional strengthening study&#13;
will provide a streamlined organizational setting for water resource&#13;
management for the City of Dhaka. Some specific objectives of this component&#13;
are listed under items (d) to (g) of the objectives of the WRMS. However, the&#13;
ultimate objective would be to develop a water resource management master plan&#13;
(WRMMP) for the City of Dhaka, including both water quantity and quality and&#13;
it will be coordinated with a proposed study of updating the national water&#13;
resource planning. The parties involved are agencies related to flood&#13;
control, storm water drainage, sewerage conveyance; water consumption and/or&#13;
use by municipality, industry, agriculture and navigation.   This component&#13;
basically compose of two parts: (i) data collection and the monitoring system,&#13;
and (ii) water resource management planning. The works of part (i) will be&#13;
closely coordinated with other ongoing donor-supported program particularly&#13;
ADB and JICA. This component will include:&#13;
Part A: Data collection and the monitoring system&#13;
a.    consolidation of existing water resource and pollution information&#13;
and formation of a data management system;&#13;
b.    assessment of data quality and creating a data quality control&#13;
system;&#13;
c.    identification of data gap under the current water resource data&#13;
collection program and establishing a coordinated data collection&#13;
system supported by a sound QA/QC program;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
d.    survey of existing water resource monitoring laboratories and&#13;
stations and the strengthening of a Dhaka water resource&#13;
monitoring system including laboratory and field station needs,&#13;
arrangement of control samples from abroad for data quality&#13;
control and data management computer system.&#13;
Part B: Water resource management planning&#13;
e.    A study on the principal issues of the development of water&#13;
resource, the uses of water resources, including an evaluation of&#13;
the current competing uses of water resource, and the impact to&#13;
the environment;&#13;
f.    development of a ground water abstraction planning and action&#13;
plan, particularly for the most seriously affected area in the old&#13;
part of the city;&#13;
g.    development of a surface water allocation planning and action&#13;
plan, particularly for ensuring adequate quality water for the&#13;
surface water treatment plants;&#13;
h.    inclusion of a demand management plan as an important part of the&#13;
above water resource development planning;&#13;
i.    development of economic incentives and control measures including&#13;
a water rights system to assist the implementation of both the&#13;
ground water and surface water action plans, including water&#13;
pricing;&#13;
j.    designing of water abstraction and delivery system program for&#13;
both ground water and surface water between competing users under&#13;
the above mentioned action plans.&#13;
Part III:   Clean Technology for Industrial Pollution Control&#13;
11.   This component will approach industrial pollution control through waste&#13;
minimization/clean technology, which helps industry to improve production&#13;
efficiency and reduce the costs for pollution control; it is different from&#13;
the more costly traditional end-of-pipe (EOP) approach of pollution control.&#13;
It will comprise of studies on the economic incentives for industrial&#13;
relocation, planning for common and joint treatment facilities in the&#13;
industrial areas, and promotion of waste minimization and clean technologies.&#13;
Specifically, the studies will include:&#13;
a.    information gathering and documentation of the existing industrial&#13;
pollution situation in and around Dhaka area including existing&#13;
and potential industrial development above the surface water&#13;
intake points, and assessment of any planning related to&#13;
industrial development including the Dhaka Metropolitan&#13;
Development Planning (DMDP);&#13;
b.    following the DMDP, study the economics and the economic&#13;
incentives of various options for industrial pollution control for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
existing industrial clusters including waste minimization/clean&#13;
technology, and joint and common treatment facilities for&#13;
industrial pollution control; and&#13;
c.    develop preliminary plan for joint and common waste treatment&#13;
facilities for selected industrial clusters such as tannery&#13;
cluster and a mixed industrial cluster.&#13;
12.   For the promotion of waste minimization/clean technology part, it will&#13;
include:&#13;
a.    enhancement of awareness for industrial waste minimization/clean&#13;
technology for, but not-limited to, people from industrial&#13;
associations, large and small industries, environmental agencies,&#13;
industrial agencies, other concerned government administration,&#13;
NGOs and public media;&#13;
b.    creating a waste minimization/clean technology training program&#13;
with interested groups such as university, industrial association&#13;
and local consulting business in developing local capacity for&#13;
conducting pollution audits;&#13;
c.    conducting a series of pollution audits for selected industries in&#13;
Dhaka with a specially formed group comprised of people of sector-&#13;
specific experts from abroad and local technical people and&#13;
environmental staff from the government;&#13;
d.    the provision of funding for the implementation of low-cost&#13;
options for industrial pollution abatement based on the&#13;
recommendations of pollution audit results; and&#13;
e.    With the experience gained from the various activities under this&#13;
component and knowledge of other countries, propose incentive&#13;
measures into present environmental regulations and standards to&#13;
promote advanced concept in dealing with industrial pollution&#13;
control.&#13;
Prolect Organization&#13;
13.   To organize a project team for the study it is necessary to involve the&#13;
main parties responsible for setting policy and regulations and implementation&#13;
of water resource activities in the greater Dhaka area. DWASA, DOE and the&#13;
Ministry of Irrigation are key players in this area and their support are&#13;
essential for the success of the study. The Water Resource Planning&#13;
Organization, under the Ministry of Irrigation, had been a coordinating group&#13;
for the national water resource planning in the past and whether its role&#13;
should be restored is something be discussed with the Ministry of Irrigation.&#13;
14.   Coordination with other water resource related study teams and donor&#13;
agencies is also important, particularly the ADB, JICA and UNDP.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
PROPOSED FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
LEAK DETECTION AND LOSS REDUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD PHASE PROGRAM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) is committed&#13;
to making a major effort to reduce unaccounted for water (UFW) in its current&#13;
operations and deal with any potential increase due to higher system pressures&#13;
which will result from the introduction of the new surface water treatment plant&#13;
under the Fourth Dhaka Water  Supply Project.   In this  regard,  DWASA is&#13;
undertaking a leak detection and loss control program in its service area. The&#13;
program is aimed at transferring of appropriate technology, including modern&#13;
specialized equipment to facilitate the implementation of a systematic control&#13;
program of non revenue water.  The program will also provide for training of&#13;
DWASA staff in new methodologies, for monitoring and evaluating effects of the&#13;
program and for assisting DWASA in repair and rehabilitation works identified&#13;
during the program. The program will also provide incentives for DWASA staff for&#13;
improved performance to bring about sustainable operating practices.&#13;
Program Obiective&#13;
2.          The primary objective of the program is to prepare and implement a&#13;
comprehensive menu of reforms to reorganize the leak detection division, provide&#13;
incentives for UFW control teams, strengthen workers training programs and update&#13;
and enforce bylaws for the reduction of unaccounted for water by about 12&#13;
percentage points during the program period and for the implementation of long&#13;
term sustainable and improved system operation and maintenance practices within&#13;
DWASA.  The program will also assist in physical rehabilitation of the water&#13;
distribution network and in reviewing the policies and practices of the DWASA&#13;
related to UFW.  The program will comprise implementation of works in three&#13;
overlapping phases and will be geared to dealing with the expected high pressures&#13;
when the Saidabad Water Treatment Plant starts operating in 1998.  These TOR&#13;
describe the scope of work for the second and third phase of the program.&#13;
Background&#13;
3.          A limited pilot area was the subject of a leak detection program&#13;
undertaken in 1991 by foreign consultants (GKW) in association with a local&#13;
partner (BETS). The program developed a methodology and an approach for tackling&#13;
the leak problem and this knowledge is available (in the form of reports) for&#13;
transfer from the local consultant (BETS). Accordingly, DWASA prepared Terms of&#13;
Reference (reviewed during pre-appraisal) for the same consultant to revisit the&#13;
pilot area and extend into two new areas as part of an immediate action program.&#13;
The consultants were sole sourced in the interest of efficiency and economy.&#13;
This first phase program started in November 1994.  The scope of work of the&#13;
first phase consists of: (a) training of DWASA staff to repair, replace, infill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7.1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
and extend pipework in the pilot area zones to updating of the calculation of&#13;
unaccounted for water and implement the loss control program identified in the&#13;
pilot program; (b) selection of two additional cells of about 500 to 1000 service&#13;
connections, and prepare designs and tender documents, and supervise the&#13;
installation of border valves, bulk and waste detection meters, including&#13;
localized consumer surveys to identify administrative losses; and (c) updating&#13;
of the distribution network drawings and preparation of detailed reports on tasks&#13;
performed. The first phase program will last eighteen months.&#13;
Administrative Actions&#13;
4.          To assist in the implementation of the program, DWASA has made&#13;
administrative changes in its organizational structure to upgrade the Waste&#13;
Prevention Division into a System Monitoring and Waste Control Circle with a&#13;
Superintending Engineer as the head of the circle. The Superintending Engineer&#13;
will act as the Project Director in addition to his normal duties until a revised&#13;
organizational set-up is approved. The immediate procurement of equipment, tools&#13;
and training materials would be achieved through retroactive financing under the&#13;
proposed IDA Credit.   The immediate activities and procurement actions are&#13;
expected to take about one and a half years, during which period the selection&#13;
and appointment of the consultants for the next phase of the work would take&#13;
place.&#13;
5.          Included in the administrative actions are specific pay incentives&#13;
over basic wages, for staff engaged in the leak detection program complying with&#13;
performance criteria devised by the consultant. This reimbursable expense has&#13;
been included in the consultancy contract.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
6.          For the second and third phase, it is expected that DWASA will&#13;
appoint a joint venture consisting of a local consulting and foreign consulting&#13;
firm. Because of the experience gained by DWASA in the pilot program and the&#13;
first phase of the current program, the local consulting firm would be the lead&#13;
firm, and would direct and supervise implementation and rehabilitation&#13;
activities. The foreign firm would have wide experience in leak detection and&#13;
control program design, survey and implementation, and would provide backup and&#13;
technical support. The consultants shall provide the following services:&#13;
(a)   Prolect Management:  Assist the project management unit of DWASA in&#13;
preparation of specifications and bidding documents for material and&#13;
equipments for the operation of leak detection and pipeline repair&#13;
work, including hand tools, repair clamps, etc.;&#13;
(b)   Analysis and Improvement:  Assist DWASA staff in review and analysis&#13;
of current polices, procedures and practices related to causes of&#13;
UFW, including, but not limited to, new water service connection&#13;
application and works, customer water service repair, customer meter&#13;
testing, repair and replacement, illegal connections, main&#13;
extensions, and make recommendations to improve existing systems;&#13;
(c)   Leak Survey and Rehabilitation:  Assist DWASA staff with all aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7.1&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
of leak detection and control, especially for the selection of&#13;
rehabilitation districts, operation of detection equipment, field&#13;
surveys and preparation of a rehabilitation program;&#13;
(d)   Technical Standards Assessment:  Assist DWASA in reviewing various&#13;
technical standards which have an impact on UFW, including meter&#13;
testing   and   installation   standards,   leak  repair  methods;&#13;
construction inspection;&#13;
(e)   Staff  Training Assistance:    Assess  staff  training  needs  and&#13;
preparation of training programs for leak detection, UFW and&#13;
distribution system maintenance/rehabilitation.&#13;
The detailed scope of work for each of the two phases is provided in the&#13;
paragraphs below:&#13;
Implementation of Program - Phase 2&#13;
7.          Based on the results of the first phase, the consultants will first&#13;
prepare a list and detailed specifications of leak detection equipment and&#13;
materials needed for the initial period of the phase. This phase is expected to&#13;
last three years. Detailed scope of work will be to:&#13;
(a)   assist DWASA in selecting suitable zones to cover about 70,000&#13;
connections within the distribution network for the purposes of&#13;
detecting and reducing water wastage as well as assessing the&#13;
various components of UFW.  DWASA maintains maps and records of&#13;
distribution networks and house connections. However, if gaps are&#13;
identified in such maps and records, the consultants shall assist&#13;
DWASA staff in obtaining and updating information required for&#13;
design and implementation for the program;&#13;
(b)   prepare a detailed program of leak detection surveys and compile&#13;
records aimed at identifying major leakage areas within each sub-&#13;
network, defective or unsuitable meters and other fittings, etc.&#13;
This activity will also detect unauthorized connections and reduce&#13;
preventable waste within consumer premises. It would also include&#13;
design of suitable public education program to mobilize cooperation&#13;
of consumers and educate them to appreciate the objective of this&#13;
exercise;&#13;
(c)   review with DWASA staff facilities available for meter testing,&#13;
repairs and maintenance of valves and other fittings within the&#13;
system and assisting consumers to remedy faulty internal systems,&#13;
etc. The consultants will also make practicable recommendations to&#13;
improve or expand facilities and for setting up new facilities&#13;
required for the successful implementation of this program.  The&#13;
consultants shall review and recommend the technical procedures for&#13;
mains installation and approval of the new service connections;&#13;
(d)   select key DWASA personnel to work with the consultants and receive&#13;
further training in particular areas of expertise required to&#13;

(h)   assist DWASA management to forecast resource requirements (staff,&#13;
equipment and budgets) as well as the organization structure needed&#13;
to implement Phase 3 of the program in terms of repairs and&#13;
replacement of faulty fittings, major leaks and rehabilitation of&#13;
obsolete pipes;&#13;
(i)   assess the availability of pipes, valves and meters (if possible,&#13;
locally) for replacement of defective equipment required to bring&#13;
about early reduction of UFW and better monitoring of leakage; and&#13;
(j) review and recommend the most economic reduction level of UFW,&#13;
taking into account the costs of leak detection and repair&#13;
campaigns.&#13;
Implementation of Program - Phase 3&#13;
8.          This phase is expected to be an on-going activity within DWASA and&#13;
will draw on the examples of the first two phases to cover the remaining zones&#13;
(over 80,000 connections). The responsibility of the consultants in this phase&#13;
will be minimal and it is expected that only a few foreign and some local&#13;
supervision consultants will be required, on a short term or need basis. The&#13;
time frame for this phase will be determined by DWASA itself based on the&#13;
remaining work to be done.   However, it is expected that the input of the&#13;
consultants will be no more than a year, after which DWASA staff will continue&#13;
activities on their own. The scope of work in this phase will be to:&#13;
(a)   execute actual leak detection surveys, based on experience gained in&#13;
the previous phases.   DWASA staff will be responsible for all&#13;
repairs of leaks on a continuous basis on the remaining pipelines&#13;
and connections;&#13;
(b)   continue with and pursue intensive on the job training of key DWASA&#13;

and consultation with DWASA. DWASA will provide counterpart staff to work with&#13;
the consultants and field staff to implement the program.   DWASA will also&#13;
provide access to the consultants of its facilities including available data,&#13;
maps, drawings and internal documents and suitable office space to house the&#13;
consultants and their counterparts.&#13;
10.         The consultants shall motivate and train DWASA staff to achieve the&#13;
program objectives working closely with DWASA management, and provide&#13;
recommendations to improve staff motivation toward the leak reduction program.&#13;
Reports&#13;
11.         The consultants will provide to DWASA and the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRDC) an inception report within&#13;
3 months from the commencement of Phase 2, with a detailed schedule for the&#13;
implementation of the balance of Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the program.&#13;
12.         About three months before the end of Phase 2, the consultants shall&#13;
prepare a Phase 2 completion report based on an agreed format.  The Phase 2&#13;
report shall be reviewed by IDA, DWASA and MLGRDC and approval given to the&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Management and Operational Support (Twinning) Program&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) recognizes&#13;
the need to improve its ability to efficiently operate and maintain its&#13;
facilities, manage scarce water supply resources in an optimal way, and to&#13;
provide its services in the least-cost manner possible. DWASA institutional&#13;
performance however, has remained weak. The main factors contributing to this&#13;
poor performance include poor institutional capability to effectively manage&#13;
and operate its facilities, a lack of capable management and trained manpower,&#13;
poor management information system and a general lack of commercial&#13;
orientation in its operations. DWASA is aware of these short comings and the&#13;
difficulties involved in transforming its operations into a commercially-&#13;
oriented entity. To this extent, a major program of assistance is proposed to&#13;
assist DWASA to improve its ability to efficiently operate and maintain its&#13;
facilities, plan for the future and bring about changes in the attitude of&#13;
utility staff in the need to adopt commercially oriented practices in&#13;
operations. These terms of reference describe the arrangements for a twinning&#13;
program between the twinning partner (hereinafter called the Partner) and the&#13;
client (DWASA); the services which the partner will provide to DWASA to&#13;
strengthen its operating efficiency, improve financial management and the&#13;
capacity of its staff to manage and operate its facilities and provide water&#13;
supply and sanitation services more efficiently; and the obligations of DWASA&#13;
under the twinning arrangement.&#13;
OVERALL OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.        The overall objective of the proposed technical assistance is to&#13;
develop the management, planning, operation and maintenance capabilities of&#13;
DWASA and to ensure that it is operated in the most efficient, cost effective&#13;
manner possible. To develop these capabilities, DWASA intends to enter into a&#13;
twinning arrangement with an experienced water utility company, using experts&#13;
in the management, commercial and financial administration, and operation and&#13;
maintenance of water supply utilities in developed countries. The proposed&#13;
twinning arrangement will be characterized by a closer involvement between the&#13;
two parties than is generally obtained in a standard client-consultant&#13;
relationship. It is aimed at direct transfer of managerial and technical&#13;
skills and systems that involve the various functional aspects of DWASA.&#13;
3.        The key objectives of the twinning arrangement would be:&#13;
(a) to provide sustained technical and managerial support aimed at&#13;
building up DWASA's capability to the point where, within four&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
years, it can independently and efficiently operate all aspects of&#13;
its operations;&#13;
(b) to assist in the development and implementation of organizational&#13;
structure, systems, procedures and practices required by a&#13;
commercial water utility;&#13;
(c) to provide back-up support in carrying out the day-to-day&#13;
operations.&#13;
4.        DWASA has already commenced a pilot program of leak detection and&#13;
repair in two zones, and has finalized a Consumer Survey, whose objectives&#13;
were to identify and properly record all water and sewer connected holdings,&#13;
including those not registered with DWASA, identify potential customers and&#13;
establish a correct computer data-base for revenue operations. The proposed&#13;
twinning program will build upon the relevant parts of the work undertaken in&#13;
these programs.&#13;
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE TWINNING PROGRAM&#13;
The Relationship of the Client and Partner&#13;
5.        The essential requirements for a successful twinning arrangement is&#13;
to create an environment in which the transfer of technology can be optimized.&#13;
The Partner as supplier of technical expertise must be able to respond to the&#13;
changing needs of the client. For its part the client organization should&#13;
also be prepared to improve its performance with the introduction of proposed&#13;
changes. Ideally, the partner should be able to offer experience and&#13;
expertise over a wide range of activities, embracing state-of-the-art methods&#13;
of planning and implementation. The guiding principle of the contract would&#13;
aim at risk sharing between the partner and the client through remuneration&#13;
that is tied to meeting agreed targets and improvements in performance. It is&#13;
expected that for this twinning arrangement expertise and experience will be&#13;
offered primarily in managerial technical assistance with emphasis on: (a)&#13;
management and finance; and (b) operations and maintenance. Assistance would&#13;
be provided through the secondment of experienced personnel primarily from the&#13;
Partners own organization (not recruited for the purpose of the twinning&#13;
contract) into parallel positions in DWASA. It will be the responsibility of&#13;
the Partner to organize its activities to suit the requirement of the client.&#13;
In entering into the twinning agreement with the Partner, DWASA as the client&#13;
will take on certain obligations to present sufficient and suitable staff for&#13;
training and to provide the physical environment and facilities for the&#13;
Partner to carry out his services according to the TOR.&#13;
6.        In addition, IDA and the Government are involved in a dialogue to&#13;
introduce further private sector participation in DWASA through a dedicated&#13;
water utility operator on a long-term basis. A strategy study has been&#13;
included in the project to help DWASA define options and recommend the best&#13;
way forward. It is expected that the Partner will help DWASA facilitate the&#13;
transition and preparation for such an arrangement. This will include&#13;
collection of information and other data, analysis, and preparation of other&#13;
required background material for the recommended option.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
Obligations of DWASA&#13;
7.        With this twinning arrangement, the obligation of the client are to&#13;
provide:&#13;
(a) access to the Partner to all the client's water supply, sewerage&#13;
sanitation and drainage facilities;&#13;
(b) available data, information maps, drawings, internal documents,&#13;
including billing, collection and accounting records;&#13;
(c) counterpart staff;&#13;
(d) suitable office space to house the experts and their counterparts;&#13;
(e) sufficient equipment and tools necessary to perform their duties as&#13;
appropriate; and&#13;
(f) sufficient operational funds to enable smooth operation of DWASA.&#13;
8.        It is a requirement of these TOR that each specialist from the&#13;
Partner's organization will work alongside DWASA counterparts, preferably in&#13;
the same office. In certain cases, the counterpart will also retain his&#13;
office. Allowance must be made in the contract for the refurbishment of&#13;
certain offices and the provision of furniture and office equipment in&#13;
addition to the technical and training equipment to be provided.&#13;
9.        It will be the responsibility of DWASA to make adequate provision&#13;
in its budget to ensure that local funds are in place to support the twinning&#13;
arrangement. Such costs are expected to include transport costs for its own&#13;
staff, out-of station allowances, and the provision of consumables.&#13;
ObliRations of the Partner and Inputs&#13;
10.       It is anticipated that three full time senior advisers (operations&#13;
and maintenance, technical and engineering, and finance and accounting) will&#13;
be needed to strengthen DWASA. These will be complemented by short-term&#13;
experts in specialized areas with appropriate expertise and experience in&#13;
those areas. One of the full time senior advisers will be the Team Leader.&#13;
The advisers and the short-term experts will serve in operational capacities&#13;
and will, together with DWASA's senior management, have joint responsibility&#13;
for overseeing day-to-day operations and implementation of systems, procedures&#13;
and practices. The Partner will also provide back up services from its&#13;
headquarters for the strengthening DWASA's structure, systems and services as&#13;
required, and technical specialist input, if needed for other tasks that will&#13;
help improve efficiency. In addition, the Partner shall act as advisor to&#13;
DWASA in its dealings with third parties. A detailed scope of work is&#13;
provided below.&#13;
11.       As indicated above, an important aspect of the twinning program is&#13;
the systematic and comprehensive transfer of knowledge and skills from the&#13;
Partner to DWASA, in particular to the counterpart staff working with the&#13;
Partner's advisors and experts. This will include transfer of training skills&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
and training materials on DWASA's operations, to enable DWASA staff to carry&#13;
over the training of officers after the end of the program.&#13;
12.       During the course of this arrangement, DWASA will be undertaking&#13;
other initiatives to improve its operational and financial performance. These&#13;
include the Leak Detection and Rehabilitation Program, and the Crash Meter&#13;
Installation Program. The Partner will liaise with the consultants&#13;
undertaking these programs and assist DWASA in implementation of the results&#13;
of these programs.&#13;
Outputs and Goals&#13;
13.       To have some measure of the performance of the twinning&#13;
arrangement, it is important that the Partner and the Client agree on a list&#13;
of outputs and goals at the outset of the services. These could be in form of&#13;
certain performance objectives and indicators, (financial, operational,&#13;
institutional), including a time-frame for transferring of the&#13;
responsibilities of specific activities to DWASA counterparts. It will be&#13;
necessary that DWASA and the partner specify and use performance variables and&#13;
targets to the extent possible. During contract negotiations, both parties&#13;
will define the specific baseline values for the performance variables&#13;
selected. Baseline values represent the specific values of the performance&#13;
variables that most closely represent present operational trends. Fixed&#13;
payment for the services rendered by the Partner will be independent of the&#13;
achievement or non-achievement of the baseline values. However, to provide&#13;
the partner with some upside incentives, DWASA and GOB will agree to incentive&#13;
payments for superior performance beyond the initial base-line values. This&#13;
feature will provide the right incentive to the selected partner and&#13;
represents a sharing of benefits between DWASA and the partner. An example of&#13;
the performance variables that could be used include: total water sold as a&#13;
percentage of water produced; average water production from tubewells;&#13;
variable cost of water per unit; and persons trained per year.&#13;
14.       To ensure that the program objectives are being met, the Ministry&#13;
of the Local Government will set up a Program Review Committee, headed by one&#13;
Ministry official (probably a Joint Secretary) and consisting of one DWASA&#13;
senior official and the Team Leader of the Twinning Program. This committee&#13;
will monitor the achievement of the performance variables selected, and other&#13;
issues relating to the program.&#13;
Time-frame&#13;
15.       The program will be carried out in two phases with a period of&#13;
reporting and review between them. The first phase will be for a period of&#13;
three months followed by a month for the preparation of an Implementation&#13;
Proposal. This first phase will be a quick diagnostic review to identify&#13;
priority areas on which significant and rapid improvement could be made to&#13;
DWASA's operations,identify the outputs and goals to be achieved, and develop&#13;
the methodology to be used in implementation. In addition, the Implementation&#13;
Proposal will prepare detailed TOR for the short-term specialists and a time&#13;
schedule for their activities and input, including the identification of their&#13;
counterparts in DWASA. The Implementation Proposal will be presented in draft&#13;
form at the end of the fourth month and will be reviewed by DWASA, GOB and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
IDA. The second phase of the consultancy will follow approval of the final&#13;
review of the Implementation Proposal, for a period of four years but the&#13;
contract will be renewed on an annual basis. This is necessary to enable the&#13;
contract to be terminated, once arrangements are in place to introduce in&#13;
DWASA private sector operators on a long-term basis. The contract between the&#13;
partner and the client will therefore include a termination clause to allow&#13;
termination of the contract based on a mutual understanding of both parties&#13;
that early termination is in both their interest.&#13;

DWASA has already embarked on a computerization program under the&#13;
Third Dhaka Water Supply Project, and the consultants will assist&#13;
DWASA to expand this program. Tasks under this area will include,&#13;
but may not necessarily be limited to the following:&#13;
(i) the definition and analysis of existing procedures, codes,&#13;
manuals and reports used by DWASA in reporting, and financial&#13;
management revenue billing and collection systems and user&#13;
requirements, and make recommendations on the general&#13;
requirements for computerizing the general ledger, accounts&#13;
receivable and payable, payroll, inventory and fixed asset&#13;
systems, and all other periodic reports to be produced by&#13;
DWASA;&#13;
(ii) advice on systems and program specifications, and available&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION AND REPORTING&#13;
Implementation&#13;
17.       It is expected that the consultancy will consist of a core team&#13;
consisting of people in the following areas: (a) technical and engineering;&#13;
(b) operations and maintenance; and (c) finance and accounting. This core&#13;
team would work with DWASA throughout the period of the consultancy. These&#13;
will be supported by short-term specialists in specific areas as required.&#13;
The need for the short-term expertise will be identified in the Implementation&#13;
Proposal, and TORs will be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;
Page 11 of 12&#13;
18.       After the first three months, an implementation proposal will be&#13;
produced in draft form (within a month). This proposal will: (a) establish&#13;
priorities in the actions to be taken; (b) identify the outputs to be&#13;
achieved; and (c) identify the methodology to be used. The proposal will also&#13;
include proposals for formal training, study tours, equipment required and any&#13;
administrative arrangements to be established to facilitate implementation,&#13;
and proposals to improve accountability, responsibility, incentives, and&#13;
sanctions for staff.&#13;
19.       During the Implementation Phase, DWASA will produce tender&#13;
documents for any work planned for the phase. The consultants will assist&#13;
DWASA in the preparation of these documents.&#13;
Operational Manuals&#13;
20.       Apart from the normal progress reports detailed below, it is&#13;
required that operational manuals be prepared and left with DWASA for every&#13;
aspect of DWASA's activities that the Partner will be involved in, for use in&#13;
day-to-day work and for use by DWASA's trainers. Manuals should be in&#13;
English, and simple and easy to understand, to facilitate translation into&#13;
Bengali, if necessary.&#13;
Reporting Requirements&#13;
21.       The following types of reports will be produced by the Partner&#13;
during the course of the Twinning Program:&#13;
(a) Implementation Proposal: This will be based on the results of the&#13;
diagnostic assessment of DWASA to be undertaken in the first phase&#13;
of the project. (para. 15);&#13;
(b) Routine Progress Reports: A bi-monthly report will be produced&#13;
describing progress being achieved in the respected activities for&#13;
each reporting period, and the expected activities for the coming&#13;
reporting period, and a description of the current problems and&#13;
recommendations on possible solutions;&#13;
(c) Milestone Report: At the beginning of each activity, a short&#13;
inception report will be prepared summarizing the objectives of the&#13;
activity, the time frame of the activity and the expected output.&#13;
This will be based on the diagnostic report prepared in the first&#13;
phase of the program. At the end of each activity, a second report&#13;
will be prepared outlining the achievements of the activity, the&#13;
tasks accomplished and follow-up steps to be undertaken.&#13;
(d) Evaluation Report: An evaluation will be undertaken every year by&#13;
the Partner, in conjunction with DWASA staff of the institutional&#13;
development directly attributable to the program, and a report&#13;
prepared. Experts from the Partner's institution not related to&#13;
the activities under evaluation will assist in the evaluation to&#13;
ensure a critical assessment. This report will be discussed with&#13;
the Program Review Committee to check real progress on the program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.1&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT&#13;
LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
1.          Land required for the physical investment aspects of the project&#13;
consist of the following:&#13;
(a)   land required on the foreshore of the Sitalakya River for the Pump&#13;
station and the intake, amounting to 0.91 acres;&#13;
(b)   land required for the right-of-way (ROW) for the culvert from the&#13;
River to the DND Canal amounting to 1.45 acres;&#13;
(c)   land required for the ROW for the culvert from the end of the DND&#13;
canal to the treatment plant site amounting to 3.64 acres; and&#13;
(d)   land at the treatment plant site amounting to 54.4 acres.  Of this&#13;
land, 13.6 acres will be used for the proposed project.&#13;
2.          Total land acquired now by DWASA for the project amounts to 6&#13;
acres, consisting of the parcels under a, b, and c above. The assessed value&#13;
of this land is US$0.8 million, which is 0.5Z of the total project cost. This&#13;
land acquisition has been approved by the Ministry of Land and is now&#13;
complete. About 37 private plots are affected.&#13;
3.          Land for the treatment plant (54.4 acres) was acquired by DWASA in&#13;
1963 under the First Dhaka Water Supply Project, in preparation for the Second&#13;
DWASA project, which was expected to be a surface water option. During&#13;
preparation of the second project the scope and size was significantly reduced&#13;
and groundwater was used instead. DWASA retained control of the land for use&#13;
in a follow-up project. The proposed project is the first surface water&#13;
supply project, and 13.6 acres of the 54 acres will be developed for the&#13;
plant. The assessed value of the total land is US$23.8 million. This is only&#13;
a nominal value as there is not going to be any transfer of funds involved.&#13;
RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.          Acquisition of the six acres involves the following resettlement&#13;
issues:&#13;
(a)   at the Sarulia intake point, (item a above), there will be loss of&#13;
foreshore, and acquisition involves removal of households on the&#13;
foreshore, estimated to be around twenty.&#13;
(b)   on the conveyance from the intake to the DND canal (item b above),&#13;
there are two fish ponds that will be affected by the culvert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9.1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
The culvert will also pass through the grounds of a school. No&#13;
buildings will be affected.&#13;
(c)   on the culvert from the DND canal to the treatment plant site,&#13;
there are six squatter shacks that will have to be removed. The&#13;
rest of the culvert will be built on agricultural land (involving&#13;
compensation, but no relocation); and&#13;
(d)   at the treatment plant site, the land is currently free of&#13;
settlements because it usually water-logged. The project includes&#13;
land development and filling at the site to raise the level and&#13;
make the site flood free.&#13;
5.          The total provision for the land to be acquired under the project&#13;
is US$0.8 million. This includes cost of the land of 0.45 million and&#13;
compensation for any loss of land along the ROW and for shacks along the DND&#13;
canal. This is discussed below.&#13;
6.          Based on the level of the relocation under these components a full&#13;
socio-economic survey and resettlement action plan was not warranted.&#13;
However, DWASA agreed to comply with IDA's resettlement guidelines, which&#13;
require that:&#13;
(a)   compensation for loss of properties is paid at the real market&#13;
value.&#13;
(b)   assistance to people who have to relocate homes or enterprises is&#13;
given, in terms of securing an alternative site for relocation or&#13;
compensation for relocation costs;&#13;
(c)   compensation for temporary or permanent loss of incomes is paid,&#13;
through a nominal lump-sum payment;&#13;
(d)   payment of compensation is completed in full before eviction; and&#13;
(e)   social services/public amenities that are affected are replaced.&#13;
Compensation payable for loss of temporary or permanent property was agreed&#13;
between DWASA and the project affected people (PAP). DWASA was asked by IDA&#13;
to confirm that arrangements for payment of compensation meet these criteria.&#13;
The confirmation was received from DWASA. In addition, DWASA retained a local&#13;
consultant to assist in resettlement activities, and in payment of&#13;
compensation.&#13;
DND CANAL&#13;
7.          Raw water from the intake to the treatment plant will flow through&#13;
the DND canal owned by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). This&#13;
canal was built in the 1970's for irrigation purposes, but is now being used&#13;
less for irrigation, because of the expansion of the city, which has resulted&#13;
in agricultural land being converted to urban land. The canal is still owned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9.1&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
by BWDB, but DWASA has signed an agreement with BWDB to use the canal to&#13;
convey raw water to the treatment plant site. There were about 180 temporary&#13;
wooden and tin shacks (built on stilts) along the canal, mainly traders,&#13;
illegally sited on BWDB land. On the banks of the canal, there were about 90&#13;
washing sites, also illegally built on BWDB land. During appraisal, a quick&#13;
survey showed that half of the shacks were empty.&#13;
8.          To protect the quality of the raw water and prevent pollution,&#13;
these shacks were removed and a fence was built on both sides of the canal.&#13;
This did not result in permanent loss of income for the traders since they&#13;
have relocated to a market nearby recently built by Dhaka City Corporation.&#13;
However, provision was made in the project for assistance with this&#13;
relocation, and compensation for temporary loss of income for the traders.&#13;
This was paid through a nominal lump-sum amount.&#13;
9.          The fence along the canal has resulted in loss of access to the&#13;
washing sites and present unauthorized extraction for domestic and in some&#13;
cases, commercial use. Included in the project is a provision of the&#13;
construction of new washing points away from the canal, using groundwater&#13;
(i.e. handpumps). This is being done with consultation with local&#13;
communities, and DWASA has been asked to prepare a plan involving these&#13;
communities, on the location of these handpumps. The impact will be positive&#13;
in that the communities will have access to cleaner water.&#13;
10.         Based on this position, no full resettlement action plan is&#13;
warranted for these reasons:&#13;
(a)   no loss of land is involved along the DND canal since the land is&#13;
owned by BWDB and the traders are on the land illegally;&#13;
(b)   the relocation will be in the same community, and will involve&#13;
shifting the shacks some yards away;&#13;
Prior to negotiations DWASA confirmed arrangements for the monetary&#13;
compensation to be paid to the evicted traders, the modalities, and the basis&#13;
for the compensation.&#13;

DWASA will be responsible for project monitoring, implementation and co-&#13;
ordination of activities. The Project Implementation Unit (headed by a&#13;
Project Director) will oversee all contracts, will be the focal liaison&#13;
unit of supervision missions   and will be responsible for providing&#13;
information required by all mi.iiions.  The Project Director will attend&#13;
all briefing and supervision mission wrap-up meetings.&#13;

Annex 11.1&#13;
Page 1 of 4&#13;
BANGLADESH&#13;
FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Assumptions to the Financial Proiections&#13;
1.    Basic Data and Assumptions&#13;
(i)      Population Growth Rate:  The current estimated population growth&#13;
rate of Dhaka City is about 4.0Z.   It is assumed that this&#13;
growth rate will continue for some time, but will decline to&#13;
about 3.7% from 1997 to the year 2,001.&#13;
(ii)     New Connections:  In FY95, Dhaka WASA provided nearly 11,107 new&#13;
connections.   Because of current limitations in water supply&#13;
availability, it is not expected that this will increase&#13;
significantly until after the new treatment plant is completed.&#13;
It has therefore been assumed that the number of new connections&#13;
will increase by 2Z between FY96 to FY98, and will increase by&#13;
5% annually from FY98 to FYOO, and 3% by the year 2001, at which&#13;
the new capacity would be almost fully utilized.&#13;
(iii)    New Hydrants:  The number of new hydrants per annum is expected&#13;
to increase by the population growth rate through the project&#13;
period. Hydrants will continue to be installed in slum and low&#13;
income areas.&#13;
(iv)      Sewerage  Connections:    Currently,  DWASA  has  about  45,466&#13;
connections. In the absence of a sewerage development program&#13;
in the project, it is assumed that the growth in sewerage&#13;
connections will be similar to the population growth rate.&#13;
(v)      Total Population Supplied with Piped Water:  This is assumed to&#13;
grow from the current 65% of the population in the DWASA service&#13;
area to about 76% by the year 2001. This growth is a factor of&#13;
combination in the growth of the population and installation of&#13;
new connections. -&#13;
(vi)     Total Population Supplied through Hydrants:  Currently, it is&#13;
estimated that about 3.8% of the population is supplied through&#13;
hydrants. This is expected to grow to 4.1% by the year 2001.&#13;
(vii)    Consumption per capita per day (lpcd):   This is an estimate,&#13;
based on  past consumption patterns, as assessed in previous&#13;
studies,  and the feasibility study of the project.   It is&#13;
assumed that this will grow by 1% between FY97 up to FY99, and&#13;
will remain constant after 1999, due to rationing and lack of&#13;
water as growing per capita consumption cannot be fully&#13;
sustained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11.1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
(viii)    Production Capacity:   The current production capacity is 192&#13;
IMGD, equivalent to 70,080 million gallons per year (MGY). to&#13;
101,313 MGY (277 IMGD) in FY99, when the new treatment plant is&#13;
completed.&#13;
(ix)     Actual Production:   Based on previous performance,  this is&#13;
assumed to increase by 3% up to 1998. Production increases by&#13;
15% in FY99 and 10% in the Year 2000 and 3% in the Year 2001.&#13;
This increase in production would utilize available production&#13;
capacity by the year 2001.&#13;
(x)      Unaccounted for Water:  Currently, the level of unaccounted for&#13;
water is estimated to be about 49Z.  It is assumed that this&#13;
will decline by about 3% annually to about 30% by the year 2001&#13;
due to the leak detection and control program, and the crash&#13;
meter installation program to be implemented under the project.&#13;
(xi)     Available Sales:  This represents the amount of water actually&#13;
billed, i.e. DWASA's production less unaccounted-for-water. The&#13;
quantity of water billed is less than the actual consumption,&#13;
because of commercial and administrative losses, or water that&#13;
is used but not billed.&#13;
(xii)    Tariff Increases:  Between FY96 to FY00, the tariff increases&#13;
reflect required tariff levels to meet agreed revenue and&#13;
operating ratios targets, to cover all costs of operations and&#13;
debt service charges within four years.&#13;
2.    Actual and Proiected Income Statements&#13;
(i)      Consumption:  Based on past experience, it is assumed that 88%&#13;
of the water is consumed by domestic users, while 12% is used&#13;
commercially.   Revenue from commercial consumers is, however&#13;
higher(about 30%) because of the higher tariffs for commercial&#13;
consumers. These assumptions are maintained in the projections.&#13;
(ii)     Sewerage Revenue:   Sewerage is charged at 100% of the water&#13;
bill. In the past, sewerage revenue has been about 51% of water&#13;
revenue. This assumption is maintained in the projections.&#13;
(iii)    Other operating revenue:   This includes revenues like meter&#13;
charges, connection fees, etc.&#13;
(iv)     Power:  Based on increases in power costs already experienced in&#13;
FY95, it is expected that power costs in FY96 and FY97 will&#13;
increase by about 7%.  Power costs will continue to increase&#13;
because of increased abstraction costs as a result of the&#13;
lowering of the ground table. Total cost increases Vill be 32%&#13;
once the new treatment plant has been installed.'  This is&#13;
expected to level off to about 15% per annum by FY2000 (see&#13;
table 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11.1&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
(v)      Chemicals:  Assumed to increase by 7% from FY96 and thereafter.&#13;
These costs are assumed to increase by 23% in FY98 to reflect&#13;
the increased chemical costs of the new treatment plant.&#13;
(vi)     Repairs and Maintenance:  These are assumed to increase by 15%&#13;
beginning in FY96.&#13;
(vii)     Salaries and WaRes:   These are assumed to increase by 15%&#13;
beginning FY96.&#13;
(viii)    Other Expenses:  These are assumed to increase by 8% beginning&#13;
in FY96.&#13;
(ix)     Insurance:   These are assumed to increase by 3% beginning in&#13;
FY96.&#13;
(x)      Provision for Doubtful Debt:  This is assumed to be 5% of total&#13;
operating revenue.&#13;
(xi)     Depreciation:   The depreciation rates for the new assets are&#13;
assumed to be: 2% for Intake, Pump Station, Culvert and the&#13;
Water Treatment Plant; 5% for ancillary structures; 3% for the&#13;
Primary and Secondary Distribution Systems Network and 20% for&#13;
motor vehicles.&#13;
(xii)    Interest:  Has been calculated on the following basis.  3% for&#13;
the First IDA Credit, 7.0% for the Second IDA Credit, 11.5% for&#13;
the Third IDA Credit, and 7.5% for the Fourth IDA Credit. In&#13;
addition,  DWASA has  incurred two ADB  loans whose  interest&#13;
charges are 7.0% and 12.5%.   The French Assistance will be&#13;
passed on to DWASA at the same terms as the IDA credit.&#13;
(xiii)    Payment  to  the  Exchequer:    A  mandatory  payment  to  the&#13;
Government by all public corporation. It is assumed that this&#13;
will be maintained at Taka 1 million. This payment represent&#13;
dividends for the Government's equity investment in DWASA.&#13;
3.    Source and Uses of Funds        -&#13;
(i)      Government Equity and Foreign Grants:  It is assumed that GOB's&#13;
contribution (equivalent to 35.8% of the total project cost)&#13;
will be passed on to DWASA as equity.&#13;
(ii)     Other grants:  These represent GOB budget allocations to finance&#13;
DWASA's other project expenditures in flood drainage services.&#13;
Based on the agreement between DWASA and GOB, it is assumed that&#13;
GOB would allocate about 75% of the cost of these expenditures.&#13;
(iii)    Japanese  Grant:    This  will  finance  the  Water  Resources&#13;
Management Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11.1&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
(iv)      IDA Loans (Third Proiect):  These represent amounts disbursed in&#13;
FY93 and FY94. The project closed in June 1994.&#13;
(v)      IDA Loans (Fourth Project):  These represent disbursements for&#13;
the project expenditure, equivalent to about 46% of the total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
(vi)     Other Loans (Foreign):   These represent disbursement of ADB&#13;
loans under the First Drainage and Flood Protection Projects.&#13;
(vii)    Debt Repayment:  It is assumed that IDA and ADB and the French&#13;
Government loans are repaid in twenty five years from the date&#13;
of disbursement, including five years of grace.&#13;
(viii)    Other   Capital   Expenditures:       This   represents   capital&#13;
expenditures for works financed by DWASA, the Government, and&#13;
bilateral donors, and includes drainage works, sewerage and&#13;
selected plant rehabilitation, and other fixed assets.&#13;
(ix)      Investments:    No  new  investments  in  fixed  deposits  are&#13;
anticipated during the project period.   It is expected that&#13;
there will be a reduction of existing investments, as funds are&#13;
used to meet debt service arrears under the First, Second and&#13;
Third  IDA  credits.    This  is  reflected  in  a reduction  in&#13;
accumulated cash position, whose balances include investments in&#13;
fixed deposits.&#13;
4.    Balance Sheet&#13;
(i)      Gross Fixed Assets:  It is assumed that 70% of the fixed assets&#13;
investments in any year are treated as capital works-in-progress&#13;
and then transferred to fixed assets in the next year. 30% is&#13;
transferred to fixed assets in the same year.&#13;
(ii)      Intangible  Assets:     These  represent  goodwill  and  other&#13;
intangible assets.&#13;
(iii)    Net Accounts Receivables:  This has been assumed to gradually&#13;
decline to three months of total operating revenue by 1998.&#13;
(iv)      Stores and Inventory:   It is assumed that there will be a&#13;
reduction in stores and inventory between FY96 and FY97 because&#13;
of the sale and disposal of obsolete and unused stores. From&#13;
FY98, stores and inventories are assumed to increase by 3% per&#13;
annum.&#13;
(v)      Other current Assets:  Assumed to increase by 1% per annum.&#13;
(vi)     Accounts Payable:   Assumed to be three months of power and&#13;
chemical costs.&#13;

Performance Indicators&#13;
1.          A set of quantifiable and measurable Performance Indicators for&#13;
DWASA will be used to monitor the achievements of the agreed targets. These&#13;
targets will be defined in the Performance Agreement to be signed between&#13;
DWASA and GOB. The objective of these indicators would be: (a) to supervise&#13;
the management of DWASA by results, and on the basis of clearly defined and&#13;
pre-established criteria rather than by sporadic intervention; (b) to clarify&#13;
the perception of managers and GOB/MLG about DWASA objectives; and (c) to&#13;
motivate DWASA managers by linking the relationship between actual and desired&#13;
performance to a set of monetary and non-monetary incentives.&#13;
2.          The targets include physical, technical and financial indicators&#13;
and targets, and definitions are given below.&#13;
Main Definitions used for the Performance Indicators&#13;
I.    Operational Indicators:&#13;
(a)   Service Coverage Level:  This is the percentage of the population&#13;
that is supplied with water either through house connections or&#13;
standposts. DWASA will achieve the minimum agreed each year.&#13;
(b)   Meter Coverage Level:  This is the percentage of the connections&#13;
that are metered, to the total connections in DWASA's service&#13;
area. DWASA will achieve the minimum percentage agreed each year.&#13;
(c)   Unaccounted for Water:  This is the percentage of water lost in&#13;
the system during production and distribution, to total water&#13;
produced. This includes technical and non technical losses.&#13;
DWASA will achieve the agreed level of lower.&#13;
(d)   No. of End-Year Connections:  This is the absolute number of&#13;
connections that DWASA would achieve each year. The number would&#13;
be agreed annually, based on an assessment of water available.&#13;
(e)   Consumption (Liter/Capita/day):  This measures service quality and&#13;
provides information on adequacy of water production and ability&#13;
to provide water on demand. Consumption levels will be agreed on&#13;
the basis of water available. DWASA will achieve the minimum&#13;
level agreed.&#13;
(f)   Average Hours of Service/Per Day:  This will be reported on a&#13;
monthly basis to determine service reliability. This will be&#13;
agreed depending on the expected amount of water available, and&#13;
DWASA will attempt to achieve 24 hour service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12.1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(g)   Production Capacity:  Total amount of water produced as a&#13;
percentage of installed capacity. DWASA will achieve the agreed&#13;
capacity levels subject to capability od distribution network.&#13;
II.   Efficiency Indicators&#13;
(a)   Staff Productivity Index:  The ratio measures the efficiency of&#13;
DWASA as a utility by relating the number of staff with the number&#13;
of connections. The ratio is calculated as staff per '000&#13;
connections.&#13;
(b)   Personnel Costs/Operational Costs Index:  This measures the ratio&#13;
of personnel costs to operational costs. This ratio will be&#13;
reviewed simultaneously with the SPI above. DWASA will achieve a&#13;
ratio of 22Z or less.&#13;
(c)   Unit Operational Cost:  This is the unit operational cost per&#13;
cubic meter (M3) of water produced. This includes only direct&#13;
costs, e.g., electricity, chemicals maintenance. This ratio will&#13;
be measured separately for deep tubewells and treatment plant&#13;
costs. DWASA will achieve agreed unit costs or less.&#13;
(d)   Tube well Productivity:  This will measure the productivity of&#13;
DWASA tubewells, to be measured in million liters per day. DWASA&#13;
will achieve agreed levels or more.&#13;
III. Financial Indicators&#13;
(a)   Working Ratio:  The ratio of operating costs to operating&#13;
revenues. Operating costs exclude depreciation and interest&#13;
payments. Operating revenues include revenues from water and&#13;
sewerage connection fees, well licensing and reconnection fees.&#13;
The ratio should be below.&#13;
(b)   Operating Ratio:  The ratio of operating costs to operating&#13;
revenues. Operating costs is the ratio includes all expenses,&#13;
together with depreciation.&#13;
(c)   Accounts Receivables/Monthly Billing:  Expressed in month&#13;
equivalent of sales, this is the ratio between the year-end&#13;
accounts receivables and operating revenues, multiplied by 12.&#13;
DWASA will achieve a receivables/monthly billing ratio of three&#13;
months by FY97.&#13;
(d)   Percentage Contribution to Investment:  The proportion of capital&#13;
expenditures financed by the net internal cash generation. Net&#13;
internal cash generation is defined as operating profit plus&#13;
depreciation. DWASA will maintain the ratios agreed annually,and&#13;
contribute no less than 25Z to its investment program by FY98.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12.1&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(e)   Collection/Revenue/Efficiencv:  This is the percentage of&#13;
collections to total billed revenue. DWASA will achieve a minimum&#13;
of 90x.&#13;
IV.   Leverage Indicators&#13;
(a)   Debt Service Coverage Ratio:  This measures the extent to which&#13;
internal cash generation covers total debt service. It is total&#13;
internal cash generation (operating profit plus depreciation)&#13;
divided by total debt service (interest and principal). DWASA&#13;
will achieve the minimum or above the debt service coverage agreed&#13;
with the Government annually.&#13;
(b)   Debt Equity Ratio:  This is the total long term debt divided by&#13;
the total long term debt and equity.  DWASA will achieve agreed&#13;
levels of D/E ratio or below.&#13;
(c)   Current Ratio:  The level of current assets to current&#13;
liabilities. DWASA will achieve agreed current ratio levels, or&#13;
higher.&#13;

FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
The economic analysis of the project was undertaken by considering the&#13;
marginal costs of deep tubewells (DTW) and the surface water treatment plant&#13;
(SWTP), to arrive at the economic least cost solution for the investment&#13;
program. The paragraphs below describe the methodology used, and the&#13;
underlying assumptions. The first section discusses the long run marginal cost&#13;
and the least cost solution, while the second section discusses the costs and&#13;
benefits of the recommended program. The analysis is based on a review of the&#13;
feasibility study, complemented with information collected by IDA missions&#13;
during appraisal.&#13;
Marginal Cost and Least-Cost Solution&#13;
1.    Given the nature of the proposed expansion program and the current&#13;
conditions of water supply in Dhaka, it is necessary to analyze the comparative&#13;
costs of water supplied by DTWs and SWTPs. According to the BCEOM Study, the&#13;
cost of a DTW field (15 tubewells) producing 395 l/s (7.5 IMGD) is US$ 11.74&#13;
million, including land acquisition. Its maintenance cost is US$ 184,400 per&#13;
year; and its operation cost (electricity, chlorine, labor) is US$ 378,500 per&#13;
year.1 It produces up to 12.45 million m per year. However, its rate of&#13;
production may decline due to the aggregate effect of ground water abstraction,&#13;
or because it may affect the production of other DTWs, or because the&#13;
development of other tubewells may affect it. According to DWASA officials,&#13;
pumping costs for DTWs have increased due to lower water levels, and&#13;
unscheduled repairs have also increased. In order to estimate unit costs,&#13;
maintenance costs have been increased by 10% to reflect possible unscheduled&#13;
repairs which have become frequent, and total output has been decreased by 10%&#13;
to account for probable losses during repairs.  The basic cost per m3 (i.e.,&#13;
without decline in production) is Tk 7.11 (Table 1).&#13;
2.    These costs may be eompared with the cost per m3 of the proposed plant at&#13;
Saidabad since all of its output will be taken up by the system once it-starts&#13;
operating. According to the updated cost provided by DWASA and BCEOM, the&#13;
capital cost of the Saidabad plant producing 2.63 m3/s is Tk 7.65 per m3; its&#13;
operation and maintenance cost is Tk 2.34 per m3 for a total of Tk 9.99 (US$&#13;
3&#13;
0.2498) per m&#13;
3.    The above costs are based on estimated prices to be paid by DWASA for&#13;
construction and operation of DTWs and the Saidabad SWTP. When these costs are&#13;
adjusted for taxes and other transfers to reflect economic values, they&#13;
decrease slightly to 6.12 Tk/m3 for water produced by DTWs without taking into&#13;
1 The original costs (BCEOM Study, Annex L) have been adjusted using an&#13;
inflation rate of 5.22% for 1992-94 (from Consumer Price Index) and an exchange&#13;
rate of 40 Tk/US$.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13.1&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
account the risks discussed below. The cost of the Saidabad SWTP decreases to&#13;
9.09 Tk/m3.  These adjustments do not affect the comparison between these two&#13;
alternatives.2&#13;
4.    In order to properly compare these two alternatives, however, it -i-.&#13;
necessary to take into consideration the probable decline in production given&#13;
existing conditions of water levels. The probability of obtaining a reduced&#13;
production increases as the water table declines. It has been observed that,&#13;
for the study area, the rate of decline of the water table has been 0.8 m per&#13;
year.3  This has resulted in an increase in the required depth of the upper&#13;
well casings from 30 to 60 meters. Water level depths, which outside the city&#13;
are adequate for the use of hand pumps (8 m), are now more than 20 m in the&#13;
central areas of Dhaka (Motijheel, Old Dhaka, Gulshan). In some areas they have&#13;
declined almost 20 m since 1965. According to an ADB report, further&#13;
development of groundwater will require that: (1) most of the existing DWASA&#13;
DTWs (200) and private (350) be reconstructed and reset at deeper pump&#13;
settings; (2) adequate sites be found to construct additional DTWs. These&#13;
effects would increase unit costs significantly.&#13;
5.    Table 2 estimates unit costs for DTWs under different rates of decline.&#13;
The cost per m3 of water produced by the SWTP (Tk 10) is equivalent to the&#13;
production cost of DTWs at a 5% annual decline rate. This may be considered&#13;
the marginal cost of potable water service in Dhaka, since DTWs cannot be built&#13;
at the required rate in the short run and their expected decline rate may be&#13;
higher than 5%. In fact, according to the Environmental Impact Assessment,&#13;
further abstraction could be limited in some areas: "water supply can be&#13;
provided from the present underground resources only until 1994/95 ... for a&#13;
restricted area around Dhaka."4  Fifty additional DTWs would have to be built&#13;
just to replace the proposed Saidabad I plant; construction of these tubewells&#13;
in the short run could cause serious damage to the current system.   It could&#13;
require the replacement of most existing DTWs, both public and private. That&#13;
is, an attempt to expand ground water production rapidly could result in&#13;
massive expenditures to replace most tubewells.&#13;
2 Adjustments were made for taxes, which could be as high as 48% for some&#13;
imported items, and the Standard Conversion Factor of 0.90 provided by the Bank.&#13;
No adjustments were made for labor because, although abundant, most processes&#13;
(especially in construction) are as labor intensive as possible and wages are&#13;
considerably low, with the minimum wage at the equivalent of US$ 1.00 per day.&#13;

6.    Under these circumstances, a reasonable strategy is to build the proposed&#13;
SWTP and meet remaining deficits with a cautious DTW expansion plan.   The&#13;
remaining question is whether the cost per m3 for surface water has been&#13;
minimized. From the history of the attempts to develop surface water sources&#13;
in Dhaka, it seems that considerable work has been done over the past 30 years&#13;
to develop and evaluate alternatives which have been now narrowed down to the&#13;
proposed plant. Any alternative previously studied has been considerably more&#13;
expensive. At this time, the Saidabad plant is the only technically viable&#13;
alternative whose costs can compete with those of DTWs.&#13;

Benefit Cost Analysis&#13;
7.    In the previous section, it was shown that the best available alternative&#13;
for expansion of the water supply capacity for the study area is a combination&#13;
of the Saidabad plant and DTWs provided that the latter are developed taking&#13;
into consideration possible water abstraction problems. The Saidabad plant&#13;
should be started immediately due to the size of the projected deficit in the&#13;
short run and the impossibility to fully substitute it by DTWs. In this&#13;
section, the benefits and costs of this solution, included in the investment&#13;
program, are calculated. The project is defined as all the activities in the&#13;
first ?hase of the investment program required to increase gross capacity by&#13;
2.63 m Is and reduce losses from 34% to 20% in the next 10 years. Therefore,&#13;
the project not only includes the construction of Saidabad I but the&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of primary and secondary distribution lines and&#13;
the improvement of DWASA's operating performance through technical assistance,&#13;
including a leak detection program.&#13;
8.    Benefits.  The benefits of potable water consumption are measured by its&#13;
value to consumers. This value is measured by the area under the demand curve.&#13;
In the absence of demand studies for the particular case of Dhaka, the demand&#13;
curve may be estimated by consumers willingness to pay as revealed by the&#13;
maximum amount that consumers are willing to pay for water. As mentioned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13.1&#13;

previously, this is nearly 27 Tk/m3 or nearly 8 times the domestic tariff, not&#13;
including time spent on procuring it. This is based on purchases of&#13;
approximately 4 gallons for Tk 0.50. This is consistent with observations in&#13;
many other countries where this figure may be as much as 50 times the average&#13;
tariff.  If consumers are willing to pay Tk 27 per m 3 for consumption at the&#13;
level of 30 lpd, average annual consumption would be 59.45 million mi3.  On the&#13;
other extreme, if the price were close to zero, per capita consumption would be&#13;
only limited by the amount of appliances and other uses by households,and it&#13;
could be near 300 lpd. To many consumers with a household connection, the&#13;
marginal cost of water is zero since many of them do not have metered&#13;
connections or meters do not function. For these and other consumers for whom&#13;
the water bill is a very small fraction of their income,5 consumption is only&#13;
limited by the amount of requirements in their households. This "maximum"&#13;
consumption was estimated at 595 million m 3 per year.  Given these two points,&#13;
the rest of the demand curve may be determined as long as its elasticity along&#13;
its different segments is "reasonable." The demand curve, estimated under these&#13;
conditions, is given by the following equation:&#13;
Q - 595 - 19.835 P&#13;
where Q measures demand in millions i3 per year and P is the price per m3. This&#13;
function is described in Table 3. It should be noted that the equilibrium&#13;
condition, Price - Marginal Cost, is achieved at Tk 10 per m3, where demand is&#13;
200 lpd and elasticity -0.50. The corresponding capacity would be available in&#13;
1998.&#13;
9.    Annual gross benefits are measured by the area under the demand curve&#13;
showing the increased supply from the Saidabad I plant and the reduction in&#13;
losses made possible by the rehabilitation and improved operation of the&#13;
network. As expected, for the current level of supply, consumers would -be&#13;
willing to pay as much as Tk 15 per m3 .  The current domestic tariff is Tk 3.49&#13;
3&#13;
per mi. At this tariff, consumers demand as much as 265 lpd, almost three&#13;
times their current consumption (Table 3). Estimated benefits are shown in&#13;
Table 4 and 5.&#13;
s For example, consumers with an income of Tk 20,000 (US$ 500) per month who&#13;
consume 60 m3 per month pay less than 1Z (Tk 197 or US$ 4.92) of their monthly&#13;
income for water.&#13;

10.    With  the project,  the volume  of water  supplied  and demanded will be  the&#13;
equivalent of 12.58 m3Is and the equilibrium price would be Tk 10 per m3.&#13;
Benefits are shown in Table 4 as the sum of "value of net capacity" (increase&#13;
in consumption times price), since all production will be consumed when&#13;
available, and consumer's surplus. These are then the gross benefits of the&#13;
project per year; discounted at a 10% rate of return over 30 years, they&#13;
amount to Tk 11,855.41 million (US$ 296.39 million).&#13;
11.    Costs.   Project  costs  include  the construction,  operation  and&#13;
maintenance of the Saidabad plant and the cost of improving the distribution&#13;
network, including technical assistance, without which the benefits of the&#13;
plant would not be fully realized. Investment costs are distributed over a&#13;
seven year period. Annual costs include operation and maintenance. The&#13;
present value of costs, at a 12% discount rate, is Tk 5995.63 million (US$&#13;
149.89 million). For purposes of estimating economic costs, the value of the&#13;
land for the Saidabad site was taken as 50% of its estimated price since the&#13;
land is a vacant lot owned by DWASA most of which remains under water during&#13;
the monsoon and no alternative use has been planned. Gross taxes on specific&#13;
items were deducted from total costs and the Standard Conversion Factor of&#13;
0.90 was used to adjust local costs.&#13;

12.   Economic Returns.  Given the above costs and benefits, net benefits of&#13;
the project amount to Tk 5859.78 million (US$ 146.49 million). The economic&#13;
rate of return is 22.26%. As shown in Table 9, net benefits are almost equal&#13;
to total costs which means that even if costs are increased by close to -100%,&#13;
the project would still be economically feasible at a 12% discount rate.&#13;
Moreover, if only 50% of the estimated benefits are obtained, the project is&#13;
still feasible.&#13;
13.   The main factor affecting project feasibility is the value of water but,&#13;
as mentioned previously, the willingness to pay is substantial and the&#13;
estimate used may be conservative given the water supply situation in Dhaka&#13;
and its probable development in the coming years. It must be noted that&#13;
population growth estimates may also be conservative. In sum, estimated&#13;
benefits are substantial as expected in a large and growing city with a large&#13;
fraction of low income population, low coverage and relatively low consumption&#13;
due to supply restrictions.&#13;
14.   It must be noted that the benefits come from both the increased-2ap*ity&#13;
and the loss reduction activities. Capacity expansion by itself - that is,&#13;
without reduction of losses - would be an economically marginal investment&#13;
given the high value of water. Its net present value would be US$ 16.3&#13;
million (at a 12% discount rate) and its IRR, 16%. Although loss reduction&#13;
activities by themselves are highly profitable in economic terms, with a net&#13;
present value of US$ 38.47 and an IRR of 29.3% (see Table 5), by themselves&#13;
they do not resolve the problem of rapidly growing deficits in any significant&#13;
manner. Furthermore, even though the IRR is higher for the loss reduction&#13;
program, the net present value (the first order condition in this case) of the&#13;
overall project is more than six times greater.&#13;

tariff is already at Tk 11 per m .  It is possible to design a tariff&#13;
structure which would increase the tariff for those income groups which can&#13;
easily afford an increase. The current tariff is almost 5% of monthly income&#13;
for the lowest income level (Taka 1,440.00 per month)  for a household&#13;
consuming 20 m3 per month. However, family units at this income level would&#13;
not have water service; instead, they make daily purchases in small amounts&#13;
and pay up to Tk 0.50 for a four-gallon container. The feasibility study&#13;
showed that low income families use on average 30 litres per capita per day,&#13;
i.e., 6 m3 per month for a household with 6.5 members,  or 1% of the minimum&#13;
income.   If the tariff is increased to 10 Tk/m3, the water bill would be 4% or&#13;
less of income for all but those with an income under Tk 5000 per month.&#13;
16.    Although in 1993-94 DWASA showed a surplus in its financial accounts,&#13;
its allocation to maintenance and rehabilitation are in sharp contrast to its&#13;
needs. Of the total Tk 854.3 million reported in revenue, only Tk 39.5&#13;
million were allocated to maintenance - mainly for emergency repairs - and&#13;
practically nothing to rehabilitation. If adequate amounts were allocated for&#13;
these activities, financial losses would be significant. Therefore, even if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13.1&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
tariffs are not increased substantially in the short run, as required by the&#13;
marginal cost criterion, they will have to include more realistic levels of&#13;
costs to finance adequate maintenance and rehabilitation.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
17.   Dhaka's public water supply is relatively low; it provides only 136 lpd&#13;
and, with estimated losses of 34%, average consumption from the DWASA system&#13;
is only 90 lpd. Coverage is about 65% of the population, but there are more&#13;
than 25 persons per connection. DWASA provides only a fraction of the&#13;
requirements of the industrial, commercial and government sectors. Private&#13;
operators supply most of their own requirements. DWASA's performance in&#13;
production and demand management needs considerable improvement. The&#13;
distribution network is in poor condition, and the quantity and quality of the&#13;
service are deficient. Capacity will have to be expanded substantially in the&#13;
near future to cope with a fast growing population, economic growth and a&#13;
relatively low consumption currently.&#13;
18.   One of the first priorities for the Government is to reorganize the&#13;
water supply sector. This requires an adequate regulatory framework for DWASA&#13;
as well as for private sector producers. It also requires an adequate demand&#13;
management program for DWASA as the main supplier for residential users. The&#13;
activities planned under the proposed Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project,&#13;
namely the construction of additional capacity, the rehabilitation of the&#13;
distribution network and the improvement of DWASA's management will address&#13;
the sector's basic problems. The economic analysis shows that investment in&#13;
these activities will generate substantial returns, as expected in a situation&#13;
where a large fraction of the population lack adequate water service and pay a&#13;
high price for small volumes of water to satisfy their basic needs. The&#13;
project as a whole has an internal rate of return of 22%.&#13;

FOURTH DHAKA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Summary of Prolect Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Fourth Dhaka&#13;
Water Supply Project presents the findings of an investigation undertaken on&#13;
behalf of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA). The level of&#13;
analysis performed was on the basis of the project being designated as&#13;
Category B, as defined by the World Bank's Operational Manual 4.01. This&#13;
category requires a lesser level of environmental investigation than for&#13;
projects that are designated Category A, which requires full environmental&#13;
assessments.&#13;
2.          The assessment focused on the potential positive and negative&#13;
impact of the proposed surface water treatment plant and related components on&#13;
the environment and surrounding areas, and the likelihood of the existing&#13;
environment affecting the operation of the proposed works. The purpose of the&#13;
assessment was to ensure that the proposed project is environmentally sound,&#13;
and to identify and determine mitigation measures that may be necessary to&#13;
minimize or avoid negative environmental impact, and suggest modifications to&#13;
the proposed project components that may be advisable to maximize&#13;
environmental benefits.&#13;
Organi z at ion&#13;
3.          Although the project was determined to be in Category B, the&#13;
assessment is organized in the format outlined for a full Category A EIA.&#13;
This included an overview of the environment and current legislation, an&#13;
assessment of potential impact, an analysis of the environmental impact of&#13;
alternatives to the proposed project, development of a management action plan&#13;
to mitigate negative impacts, and identification of institutional needs to&#13;
implement environmental assessment recommendations.&#13;
Findings&#13;
4.          The Fourth DWASA Project marks the start of a major surface water&#13;
development program for DWASA. By the year 2020, the intention is to have a&#13;
capability of 200 IMGD. The EIA has focused in the first phase of this&#13;
development program. A major long-term benefit of the project will be the&#13;
provision of treated water to supplement groundwater abstraction and help&#13;
reduce drawdown of the latter. However, the major long-term benefits are&#13;
those connected with water quality; firstly, the chemical and other treatments&#13;
will produce potable water in comparatively large volumes and, secondly,&#13;
distribution of the treated water in the new water mains implemented during&#13;
the project will make treated water available for the first time to about&#13;
500,000 consumers, with great amenity and public health benefits. The&#13;
positive impacts will be strengthened by the concurrent program of leak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14.1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
detection and rehabilitation which will enable greater water pressures to be&#13;
maintained in the system and help prevent contamination from external sources.&#13;
5.          The third benefit is that in taking steps to preserve the quality&#13;
of its raw water supplies, DWASA will be improving the physical environment&#13;
along the DND Canal (for the Saidabad Development) and in the rivers providing&#13;
the raw water. This automatically implies measures to protect river&#13;
catchments from pollution, and the EIA makes clear recommendations for inter-&#13;
agency co-operation and the development of legal and other controls for water&#13;
protection&#13;
6.          This development of controls is essential, since maintenance of&#13;
raw water quality cannot be guaranteed in the future: what few planning&#13;
regulations exit can be easily flouted, monitoring and compliance checking are&#13;
minimal or non-existent, and there is no effective legislation under which&#13;
persistent offenders can be prosecuted for environmental pollution. The&#13;
passing of the 1994 Environmental Pollution legislation and supporting&#13;
Environmental Quality Standards is vital, and DWASA should press strongly for&#13;
adoption. Strengthening of the planning procedures is also urgently needed&#13;
and, as a first step, compulsory notification of the Department of Environment&#13;
(DOE) is recommended for all new industries or other developments likely to&#13;
make harmful discharges. This_ should be a mandatory part of new industry&#13;
registration (where tax and other concessions are incentives to register) and&#13;
the DOE, in consultation with DWASA and planning authorities, such as RAJUK,&#13;
should ensure that harmful discharges are banned from rivers and related&#13;
catchment areas used as surface water treatment plant raw water sources.&#13;
7.          This vulnerability of the river waters to major urban, industrial,&#13;
and agricultural development is the major negative impact of external&#13;
environmental influence on the project; minor effects can also be expected&#13;
from small developments along rivers.&#13;
8.          The project itself is expected to have five specially negative&#13;
impacts:&#13;
(a)   the production of increased volumes of wastewater concomitant with&#13;
the extra supply of water;&#13;
(b)   the restriction of certain urban and industrial enterprises in&#13;
locations which have otherwise favorable development&#13;
characteristics, such as communication, etc.; and&#13;
(c)   three specific effects of the Saidabad development on the DND&#13;
Canal and at the SWTP site:&#13;
(i)    the removal and relocation of washing points;&#13;
(ii)   the removal and relocation of shacks at present used for&#13;
small businesses; and&#13;
(iii)  the production of large volumes of sludge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14.1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
9.          In parts of Dhaka City, notably the Old City and in the west of&#13;
the area to be supplied by DWASA IV, the sewerage system is in poor condition,&#13;
inadequate or non-existent. Mitigation measures will be a part of the&#13;
forthcoming Sanitation and Sewerage Study under the project. Siting of&#13;
industries is already a part of the zoning policies of the RAJUK which is in&#13;
the process of preparing the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan; DWASA needs&#13;
to liaise closely with this planning process. For the actions on the DND&#13;
Canal, a specific mitigation plan is proposed, to be undertaken by the&#13;
development contractor to fence the area along the DND Canal, in consultation&#13;
with DWASA.&#13;
10.         Mitigation of the possible impacts of sludge production will be&#13;
achieved by the use of settling lagoons and the periodic disposal of the&#13;
sludge in sanitary landfill operations.&#13;
11.         Minor impacts, such as possible accidental spillage of chemicals,&#13;
will be mitigated by normal operating and safety procedures.&#13;
12.         Finally, the investment in major surface water developments&#13;
automatically means that DWASA must take a broader view of environmental&#13;
developments for a wide area around Dhaka. It is recommended that DWASA set&#13;
up an Environmental Cell, developed from its existing Quantity Control&#13;
Department, to be a focus of environmental expertise and training within the&#13;
Authority and to undertake the necessary environmental monitoring actions.&#13;
Summary: Key Recommendations&#13;
DWASA must take the initiatives above, and the following actions:&#13;
Immediate Actions&#13;
1.          Send an outline of the proposed surface water treatment plan&#13;
developments to the main planning organizations, and restrictions required on&#13;
the rivers to be used as raw water sources, especially Lakhya/Balu River.&#13;
2.          Press for the rapid passing of the new environmental legislation,&#13;
already within the Parliamentary system and the Gazetting of Environmental&#13;
Quality Standards.&#13;
Short-Term Actions&#13;
3.          DWASA needs to put into place a short-term monitoring program&#13;
under an overall Environmental Monitoring Plan, with the establishment of an&#13;
Environmental Advisory Panel to advise on environmental problems. The DWASA&#13;
water laboratory should be rehabilitated and upgraded to start a major program&#13;
of water quality monitoring.&#13;
Long-Term Actions&#13;
4.          Formulation of an overall water resources development policy to&#13;
cover both surface and groundwater developments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14.]1&#13;
